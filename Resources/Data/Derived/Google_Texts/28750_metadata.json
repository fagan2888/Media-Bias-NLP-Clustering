But Stanley Matsumoto, son of Matsumoto Shave Ice founders Mamoru and Helen Matsumoto, said business has been booming since the soft opening of Kamehameha Schools\u2019 latest retail project, the 27,000-square-foot Haleiwa Store Lots.\n\nThe plantation-inspired retail, dining and cultural gathering place is only 60 percent complete, but already it has become a must-see stop in the historic North Shore beach town where 2.5 million tourists come through annually, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser (http://ow.ly/K7ZbG ) newspaper reported.\n\nMatsumoto\u2019s is the anchor for the new $16 million project, which sits on 4 acres of the 26,000 acres of North Shore land owned by Kamehameha Schools.\n\nMatsumoto\u2019s turned 64 years old in February and moved to an expanded location within the Haleiwa Store Lots. Now it and 11 other specialty shops of the 20-something planned for the development are attracting lots of tourists who are hungry for a bit of North Shore culture, niche retail items and cuisine.\n\nStanley Matsumoto said it\u2019s a far cry from the world his parents found themselves in when they added shave ice to their quiet country shop in the 1950s just to make ends meet.\n\n\u201cI remember my parents used to stay open late waiting for the theater to let out - that\u2019s how hard they were struggling. My dad used to borrow bread from the local supermarket, and in order to repay their kindness, he\u2019d do their lawn with a hand-push mower,\u201d said Matsumoto, who was born and raised in Haleiwa and lives across the street from the development.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re so busy that we\u2019ve got new challenges now. But my parents would be so happy to see this.\u201d\n\nIn addition to longtime North Shore staples, the project also has attracted several isle retailers who wanted a North Shore location but shied away from other opportunities because they lacked the project\u2019s mix of visitors and locals.\n\nWhile not all local residents and businesses were in favor of changing quaint Haleiwa town, Kalani Fronda, Kamehameha Schools\u2019 asset manager, said the developers worked for well over a decade to ensure that the project encompassed Haleiwa\u2019s history and culture and kept to its small footprint.\n\n\u201cKamehameha Schools began conceptualizing the project in the 1990s after leases on our land came back. This project has been in development since 2006,\u201d Fronda said. \u201cWe started by meeting with kupuna to see what they envisioned. For many years we leased our lands to the sugar plantation and collected rent. Now we\u2019re taking an active role in the community and making our lands more productive. The whole development should be open by June.\u201d\n\nHattie Nichols, who was born in 1931 and grew up in Haleiwa town, said she likes that Kamehameha Schools asks for community feedback and listens to local residents. But despite those efforts, Nichols said she\u2019s not sold on the project.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice, but it makes me think that I\u2019m in the city. When I was growing up, I could stop in any store and they knew whose kid that I was. \u2026 It\u2019s not like the old style. Now there\u2019s too much of everything. It\u2019s overwhelming,\u201d Nichols said.\n\nHowever, others say they welcome opportunities for businesses to tap into an underutilized tourist market and for residents to work where they live and have assurance that their children will have similar chances.\n\nLori Nahooikaika, deli manager for Whalers General Store and fruit stand, said the store\u2019s Jan. 10 opening also gave her the chance to work near home.\n\n\u201cThis is the first store that we\u2019ve opened in Haleiwa. We\u2019re normally in the biggest tourist industry spots, but with Matsumoto\u2019s helping us along, we\u2019re getting lots of customers,\u201d Nahooikaika said.\n\nTed Tsakiris, co-owner of Teddy\u2019s Bigger Burgers, said the development\u2019s emphasis on culture inspired the chain\u2019s first tiki bar-inspired Teddy\u2019s Bigger Burgers, which opened late February.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d been approached by various North Shore locations for the better part of 15 years, but it never felt right before. This newest location broke the mold for us,\u201d said Tsakiris, who has been expanding his chain for 17 years. \u201cThe design guidelines irritated me at first, but they proved to be divine intervention.\u201d\n\nTeddy\u2019s Bigger Burgers locations are generally known for their 1950s diner style. In Haleiwa, Tsakiris used reclaimed fencing from Don Ho\u2019s estate and from Hilton Hawaiian Village circa the 1950s. The counters, which sport tiki carvings from Gecko\u2019z South Sea Arts, were made from repurposed flooring from Punahou School.\n\nBy mixing touches of older materials and local art, Tsakiris ensured that his Haleiwa location captured the spirit of a 1930s-era plantation town. The concept was so popular that just two days after opening, Tsakiris asked Susan Todani, director of development for Kamehameha Schools, to find him more space to open another business.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had excellent traffic, and we might even be hitting some banner number,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat really makes this work is its strong mix of visitors and locals.\u201d\n\nGeoff Oamilda, store manager for T&C; Surf Designs\u2019 first country store, said results are promising for the new location.\n\n\u201cThis is our first store outside of a mall, but we\u2019re seeing strong numbers,\u201d he said.\n\nTodani pinned results on the development\u2019s vision, which hinged on creating a friendly gathering place for locals and visitors. To that end, Kamehameha Schools worked to preserve some of the site\u2019s original buildings, including Matsumoto Shave Ice and the two Yohida buildings, which were built in the early 1900s. Kamehameha also re-created two historic buildings formerly housing Aoki\u2019s Shave Ice and \u2018Iwa Gallery.\n\n\u201cWe tried to preserve the history and culture and keep the development small-scale, more like a string of mom-and-pops. We wanted our buildings to look like little shops that grew up over time,\u201d Todani said.\n\nThe local feel adds something to the tourism experience, said Montana visitor Josh McDonald.\n\n\u201cThis is pretty awesome,\u201d said McDonald, who was planted on one of the development\u2019s benches. \u201cVisitors want to be in a place where they can interact with the local community.\u201d\n\nKamehameha Schools invested $750,000 into the construction of a 650-foot walkway and added 95 parking stalls. Courtyards for entertainment and cultural classes also were constructed to make the site welcoming to patrons as well as to the many chickens roaming the country vista.\n\nPrior to the project, Kamehameha Schools invested $13 million in North Shore agricultural water improvements and got 9,400 acres of North Shore land designated as an important agricultural area. Now Fronda said store lots are encouraged to use local farm produce.\n\nTodani said cultural activities, similar to those at Royal Hawaiian Center, will educate people about the history and culture of Haleiwa and the North Shore. And proceeds from the site will help educate Hawaiian children, she said.\n\n\u201cOnce fully opened, net profits from this development alone are expected to generate an additional $1 million (per year) for Kamehameha Schools\u2019 educational mission,\u201d Todani said.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Honolulu Star-Advertiser, http://www.staradvertiser.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "The lines snaking out the door at Matsumoto Shave Ice on a recent February day were longer than normal for the season.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The lines snaking out the door at Matsumoto Shave Ice on a recent February day were longer than normal for the season.", "title": "Haleiwa\u2019s new look is a hit with businesses, visitors", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/mar/15/haleiwas-new-look-is-a-hit-with-businesses-visitor/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/03/11/e46dd4761fd0670b700f6a706700f592.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/03/11/e46dd4761fd0670b700f6a706700f592.jpg", "description": "The lines snaking out the door at Matsumoto Shave Ice on a recent February day were longer than normal for the season.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Haleiwa\u2019s new look is a hit with businesses, visitors"}, "Author": "ALLISON SCHAEFERS", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb606\"", "article_summary": "Matsumoto\u2019s turned 64 years old in February and moved to an expanded location within the Haleiwa Store Lots.\n\u201cWe\u2019d been approached by various North Shore locations for the better part of 15 years, but it never felt right before.\nPrior to the project, Kamehameha Schools invested $13 million in North Shore agricultural water improvements and got 9,400 acres of North Shore land designated as an important agricultural area.\n\u201cKamehameha Schools began conceptualizing the project in the 1990s after leases on our land came back.\nTodani said cultural activities, similar to those at Royal Hawaiian Center, will educate people about the history and culture of Haleiwa and the North Shore."}
