The helmet cam of a firefighter who responded to the scene shows that a firetruck was warned about 16-year-old Ye Meng Yuan lying on the ground nearby.\n\nThe firetruck ran her over fifteen minutes later, while she was still alive, according to CBS News, which obtained the video. Another truck ran her over minutes later. The video appears to contradict initial reports that Ye's body had been covered by firefighting foam, and was difficult to see.\n\nCBS obtained the footage from a source close to Ye's family, which has filed a gross negligence claim against the city.\n\n\"There were a number of mistakes made. That no one actually took 30 seconds to a minute to check the young woman on the ground, to check her vital signs before moving on is simply unforgivable,\" said former National Transportation Safety Board managing director Peter Goelz.\n\n\n\nAttorneys for the family say the emergency worker who spotted Ye on the ground \"failed to move her to a safe location.\"\n\n\"I'm not always a big fan of plaintiffs' attorneys, but in this case they have a real strong point,\" said Goelz.\n\nThe former NTSB official said if he were investigating the Asiana crash, he would \"apologize from the bottom of my heart. And I would say, 'Listen, we're going to set new policies and procedures, and make sure that this never happens again.'\"\n\nThe NTSB had a hearing on the investigation, which is ongoing.\n\n\"They are zeroing in on pilot error and zeroing in on how the three pilots in the cockpit interreacted with the sophisticated fly-by wire system that governs the plane.\n\n\"It's going to come down to human performance, I believe, in the end,\" said Goelz.", "article_metadata": {"description": "(CNN) -- Shocking new video has come out in the moments after the crash of Asiana Airlines flight 214 in San Francisco last summer that killed three and injured more than 180 others.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "title": "Fmr.
