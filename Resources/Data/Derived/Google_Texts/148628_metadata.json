That's the upside.\n\nThe downside risks for hospitals include the expectation that there will be surge in medical services utilization, particularly from the expanded Medicaid population.\n\nResearch conducted on the 2008 lottery-based expansion of Medicaid in Oregon raised alarms in hospital board rooms last year. The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, found a spike in medical service utilization after Oregon's Medicaid expansion.
