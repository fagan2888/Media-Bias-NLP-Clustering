Although, Sacher along with his colleagues found that, there is an increase in connectivity in the 2-regions of the brain, particularly cerebellum and thalamus.\n\nFurthermore, the researchers claimed that, the new findings symbolize a vital first-step to clinical studies in patients affecting from depression.\n\nThis study is published in the Cell Press journal Current Biology.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "anti-depressants, antidepressant improves, brain, current biology, does changes brain, human brain, julia sacher, lexapro, single dose changes brain, single-dose", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "Capital Wired", "description": "Follow The scientists revealed that just a single dose of anti-depressant is sufficient to make spectacular alterations in the functional structural design of the human brain.
