This weekend, America's GOP royalty will gather in Iowa to talk things out.

As many as 10 potential Republican presidential candidates will speak at the Iowa Freedom Summit, an all-day event organized by Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa.

Expected to be in attendance are neurosurgeon Ben Carson; Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn.; Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker; former Sen. Rick Santorum; former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton; Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas; former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina; former Texas Gov. Rick Perry; New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie; and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, according to The Run, which will have updates on the summit from Iowa.

Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and 2012 GOP candidate Mitt Romney are expected to be notably absent, despite invitations to attend. Bush and Romney lead the GOP field in The Chase, our ranking of candidates most likely to run for president in 2016.

Trips by potential candidates have been heating up this month, a trend that will likely continue as more GOPers make their candidacies public.
