Mary Landrieu took to the floor Nov. 21, 2009, she was determined to set the record straight. With Senate leaders still struggling to find the votes for the law that would become known as Obamacare, rumors began leaking to the press that Majority Leader Harry Reid had secured the Louisiana Democrat\u2019s vote with a promise of $100 million in Medicare payments to the state.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t true, and Landrieu was none too pleased. \u201cI am not going to be defensive about asking for help in this situation, and it is not a $100 million fix. It is a $300 million fix. \u2026 I\u2019m proud to have asked for it. I\u2019m proud to have fought for it,\u201d Landrieu declared matter-of-factly.\n\nLandrieu\u2019s floor speech was all the more remarkable given the intense pressure Democrats were under from Republicans over Obamacare. Within weeks, fellow centrist Sen. Ben Nelson found himself embroiled in controversy over the \u201cCornhusker Kickback\u201d \u2014 a $45 million provision inserted into the health care measure for Nebraska that Reid had included as a sweetener for Nelson\u2019s vote.\n\nNelson then followed the conventional wisdom \u2014 if you\u2019re a red state, moderate Democrat, you need to run from your party, its signature legislation, and any hint that you break conservative fiscal orthodoxy. But that strategy didn\u2019t help Nelson, who watched as conservatives mounted an aggressive campaign around the earmark, ultimately forcing him into early retirement.\n\nMeanwhile, Landrieu has embraced her record for bringing home the bacon, hasn\u2019t shied away from her Obamacare votes and finds herself in a good position to win reelection in one of the most conservative, anti-Obama states in the nation.\n\n\u201cIt was just the way I was to taught to be, or encouraged to be, by my father and my parents,\u201d Landrieu told BuzzFeed.\n\nA recent Landrieu campaign ad makes clear just how central her incumbency \u2014 and the benefits of seniority in the Senate \u2014 will be to her election bid, invoking her position as chairman of the Energy Committee, which the narrator solemnly assures the viewer is \u201cthe most powerful position in the Senate for Louisiana.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"bf": {"buzzid": 3224361, "userid": 315300}, "description": "\"I don't apologize.\" The Louisiana Democrat is vulnerable in 2014, but she isn't running a quiet campaign...", "copyright": "Copyright 2016 BuzzFeed, Inc.
