It is believed to be California\u2019s first bingo hall to be located in a shopping center.\n\nBingo has a long history at Viejas. Starting in 1977 it\u2019s been moved several times to provide room for the growing number of players. It was during refurbishing the casino after completing the first hotel and prepping for the second, that the new plan for bingo was derived.\n\n\u201cWe wanted the best use for the casino floor space and to add more slots \u2013 key revenue for casinos,\u201d said Robert Scheid, vice president of community and public relations. \u201cWe relocated Anna\u2019s Linens in the Outlets to a better location and their spot became the new dedicated bingo hall.\u201d\n\nThe hall has a 6,000 sq. ft. bingo floor with 400 seats, dedicated smoking and non-smoking areas, a snack bar and valet parking. Players can use traditional paper sheets and daubers, or portable hand-held electronic bingo tablets and flat screen monitors that allow them to play up to 500 bingo games at a time.\n\nThe new hall will accommodate 400 players three times a day to the Outlets which will also spur more business for the shops, eateries and other entertainment venues in the Outlets which is directly across the street from the Casino and hotel. A long line of players \u2014many who arrived half a day before the ribbon cutting\u2014was energizing for the Viejas Tribal Council Members who supported this idea.\n\n\u201cIt was an honor to see friends, supporters and business partners from the county of San Diego, Imperial Valley and other counties as well,\u201d Scheid said. \u201cThe tentacles that come out from an enterprise like this have benefits that go both ways in the community financially and otherwise.\u201d\n\nViejas Bingo will award $45,000 in April and a chance to win one of two new FIAT 500s. However, the tribal decision to relocate was also about satisfying the players.\n\n\u201cWe responded to guests\u2019 request; more room, a snack bar, and no smoke to walk through before getting to their seats,\u201d said Viejas Tribal Chairman Anthony Pico. \u201cIn aboriginal times quests services were very important to us, and my elders told us when other tribes would come through we would make sure they had a place to stay, rest and get provisions before moving on. That\u2019s why we continue those traditions; it\u2019s part of our genetics. We\u2019re grateful for all who keep coming back, because in our hearts we really enjoy being of service.\u201d\n\nChris Kelly, General Manager of the Viejas Casino & Resort, added, \u201cWe are committed to bringing the best casino resort experience to San Diego today, tomorrow and for years to come.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Viejas Band of Kumeyaay Indians selected a highly trafficked area for its new Bingo Hall\u2014the Viejas Outlets.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "klb678", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/04/11/bingo-viejas-tribe-brings-gaming-shopping-center-near-san-diego-154420", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/viejasbingo.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Bingo!
