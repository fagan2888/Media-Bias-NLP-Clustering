I am a licensed Realtor with Montague, Miller & Co in Culpeper, VA. As a resident of this wonderful area, I am so happy to have the chance to work with customers and showing them all the things which make this a great place to live. I work as a buyer's agent assisting first time home buyer's from start to settlement, and beyond. I work with clientswho purchase investments and secondary homes. As a buyer's agent I bring to the table: strong negotiating skills, easy accessibility, the ability to anticipate problems which may arise, a strong knowledge of the real estate market, and much more. I work as a listing agent helping seller's determine the value of their home, preparing an individualized marketing plan, and working aggressively to assist in the sale of the property. I will assist in relocations either helping to sell your home to relocate, and helping to refer you to an expert in the area to which you are moving. I will assist buyers relocating to the area, helping to familiarize them with the area, and providing them the tools needed to choose the right location. I have a broad knowledge of the short sale and foreclosure market. I am a designated SFR (Short Sale & Foreclosure Resource). One of the biggest struggles for sellers facing financial difficulty, is understanding their options. I've been trained to explain these options and strategies to homeowners so they can make the best decision for their future. Our real estate company has kept pace, adapting to rapid growth and a changing economy while maintaining exacting standards and integrity. As an active, local agent, I am available to address all of your real estate needs. Please call me or send an email when you are ready to visit some homes, or to schedule a free home selling consultation. I look forward to working with you!", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Progress", "description": "\u201cThis is really phase one of a two-phase project.
