The ACA\u2019s first open enrollment period was still going at that point, so there was no way to know how many Obamacare enrollees there were, their ages, their health status \u2013 all factors that go into calculating rate increases. Getting a better picture of what the rate adjustments for 2015 would like required waiting, and patience.\n\nWell, now we\u2019re starting to see the picture develop, and it looks very different from the 100-percent increases conservatives were secretly (or overtly) hoping for just a few months ago. PricewaterhouseCoopers put together a \u201cpreliminary look at 2015 individual market rate filings,\u201d and they found that, for the 27 states for which data are available, the average premium increase will be 7.5 percent. It\u2019s all preliminary, of course, but it\u2019s a hell of a lot better than the Hill\u2019s citation of a former insurance executive\u2019s \u201cgut\u201d feeling. The New Republic\u2019s Jonathan Cohn writes that \u201cthe experts I consulted all saw the available information as relatively encouraging, particularly in comparison to what many were predicting just a few months ago.\u201d\n\nSo where are conservatives looking for proof that the Affordable Care Act is not living up to its moniker? Florida. The Miami Herald reported earlier this week that \u201cFloridians who buy health insurance on the individual market for next year will face an average increase of 13.2 percent in their monthly premiums, according to rate proposals unveiled Monday by the state\u2019s Office of Insurance Regulation.\u201d That isn\u2019t anywhere near the \u201cskyrocketing\u201d that Republicans assured us was coming, but 13.2 percent would qualify as a \u201cdouble-digit rate increase,\u201d and conservatives were quick to point that out. (Consumer health advocates in the state accused regulators of employing a flawed methodology, as the Herald notes.)", "article_metadata": {"description": "Gov.
