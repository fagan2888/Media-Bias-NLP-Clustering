It is important for tax practitioners and their expatriate clients to be aware of these changes when filing this year\u2019s tax returns.\n\n1. Taxing gifts to US citizens or residents. The Heroes Earnings Assistance and Relief Tax (HEART) Act of 2008 imposes an exit tax on US citizens and long-term green card holders who expatriate from the United States. The HEART Act also imposes a tax on US citizens or residents who receive covered gifts or bequests from covered expatriates. This tax is codified in Code Section 2801.\n\nOn Sept. 10, 2015, the IRS issued the long-awaited Section 2801 proposed regulations. A covered gift or bequest is one that is received from a covered expatriate. A covered expatriate, which is defined in Code Section 877A(g)(1), is, with limited exceptions, a US citizen who surrenders his or her US citizenship, or a long-term resident of the United States who ceases to be a lawful permanent resident.\n\nTo qualify as a covered expatriate, an individual must have a net worth of at least $2 million (not indexed by inflation), an average net income tax for the five years ending before the surrender of citizenship or permanent residency of more than $161,000 (in 2016, indexed for inflation), or fail to show that he or she complied with the US tax laws for those five years.\n\nThe tax is imposed at the highest transfer tax rate (currently 40 percent) in effect for the year that the gift or bequest is received, regardless of the amount of the gift or bequest.", "article_metadata": {"foaf": {"name": "Elizabeth Feeley"}, "dcterms.title": "How Recent Tax Law Changes Affect Expatriates", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Individuals"}}, "og": {"site_name": "AccountingWEB", "title": "How Recent Tax Law Changes Affect Expatriates", "url": "http://www.accountingweb.com/tax/individuals/how-recent-tax-law-changes-affect-expatriates", "image": "http://www.accountingweb.com/sites/default/files/styles/media_medium/public/expatriates_eldad_carin.jpg?itok=te_T0g1V", "updated_time": "2016-04-12T06:15:00+00:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.accountingweb.com/tax/individuals/how-recent-tax-law-changes-affect-expatriates", "card": "summary", "title": "How Recent Tax Law Changes Affect Expatriates"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#dce6eb", "dcterms.identifier": "http://www.accountingweb.com/tax/individuals/how-recent-tax-law-changes-affect-expatriates", "dcterms.creator": "Elizabeth Feeley", "dcterms.date": "2016-04-12T06:15+00:00", "dcterms.language": "en", "msapplication-TileImage": "/sites/all/themes/awus/favicon-152.png", "dcterms.type": "Text", "sift": {"targeting": "[{\"key\":\"tag\",\"value\":[\"Affordable Care Act\",\"Estate tax\",\"Thomson Reuters\"]},{\"key\":\"type\",\"value\":\"Article\"},{\"key\":\"subtopic\",\"value\":\"Individuals\"},{\"key\":\"topic\",\"value\":[\"Individuals\",\"Tax\"]},{\"key\":\"url\",\"value\":\"node_26613\"},{\"key\":\"status\",\"value\":\"live\"},{\"key\":\"homepage\",\"value\":\"0\"},{\"key\":\"user\",\"value\":\"out\"},{\"key\":\"CxSegments\",\"value\":\"\"}]"}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-04-12T00:07:07+01:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-12T13:39:26+01:00"}, "cXenseParse": {"sft-section": "Individuals", "sft-tag": "Thomson Reuters", "sft-date": "Apr 12th 2016", "sft-type": "Article", "sft-topic": "Tax", "recs": {"category": "Article", "articleid": "node-26613", "publishtime": "2016-04-12T00:07:07:000Z"}, "sft-author": "Elizabeth Feeley", "sft-title": "How Recent Tax Law Changes Affect Expatriates"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "There have been several recent changes and updates to the tax law that affect expatriates.\nIt is important for tax practitioners and their expatriate clients to be aware of these changes when filing this year\u2019s tax returns.\nThe HEART Act also imposes a tax on US citizens or residents who receive covered gifts or bequests from covered expatriates.\nA covered gift or bequest is one that is received from a covered expatriate.\nThe Heroes Earnings Assistance and Relief Tax (HEART) Act of 2008 imposes an exit tax on US citizens and long-term green card holders who expatriate from the United States."}
