John Kasich spoke to a packed auditorium of more than 400 people in Colchester in his second visit to Vermont on Saturday. The Republican presidential candidate pitched himself as a fiscally conservative moderate who would prioritize creating jobs.\n\nAnd Kasich broke from the GOP party line on issues of health care, welfare and climate change.\n\nDressed simply in a light blue sweater and slacks, Gov. Kasich portrayed himself as a go-getter who would bring common sense to the White House. Kasich said if he were elected to lead the country, his main focus would be on training workers to learn employable skills, creating jobs and getting rid of excessive regulations.\n\n\u201cThere are so many mindless, stupid regulations,\u201d he said. \u201cKnock it off, and help small businesses to grow, because they are the ones that put our kids into jobs, and stop punishing them with excessive regulations.\u201d\n\nWhile Kasich\u2019s calls for job creation and bringing together Republicans and Democrats were met with cheers, the audience also had some tough questions.\n\nOne woman asked what he would do about government-mandated health care. Kasich didn\u2019t directly respond to whether he would try to repeal the Affordable Care Act. He switched course by explaining how he expanded Medicaid in Ohio.\n\n\u201cWe took Medicaid \u2014 these legislators will tell you that Medicaid is the toughest program to control \u2014 and we took the Medicaid from 10.5 percent growth down to 2.5 percent growth the second year I was governor,\" he said. \"We didn\u2019t take one person off the rolls, and we didn\u2019t cut one benefit.\u201d\n\nKasich also said that a part of Obamacare he would keep is the provision that insurers cannot deny people coverage because of preexisting conditions.\n\n\u201cI get criticized because some Democrats like me, so I just keep doing what I\u2019m doing, and all you Democrats out there, you blue-collar Democrats, hardworking Democrats who feel the party has left you behind, come give me a vote.\u201d\n\nGregory Seward is a veteran, and he pressed Kasich on what he would do about the lengthy wait times that veterans face to get medical care.\n\n\u201cIt takes months between tests. We drive 90 minutes each way, there are disabled veterans over in the Northeast Kingdom that won\u2019t go to White River Junction because, I\u2019m going to go be down there, waste all day for one test and then they\u2019re going to tell me to come back in three months.\u201d\n\nKasich agreed this was a big problem, and suggested that some veterans may be better off seeing other doctors outside of Veterans Affairs.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not totally convinced that going to private physicians is the answer,\u201d said Seward. However, he said that while for years he has been a fan of Sen. Bernie Sanders, he is intrigued by Kasich and will consider the candidate.\n\n\"I thought he took gutsy stances, not necessarily the party line, and I like that about him. He seems like an independent thinker and I'm really interested to find more about him.\" -Mary Ellen Varhue, of Georgia, Vermont\n\nThe governor also fielded questions about climate change, where unlike many of his fellow Republican presidential candidates, he said the science shows that human activity is influencing the climate, and as a country we should focus more on renewable energy.\n\nKasich was not asked about the issue of abortion, but liberal media outlets have criticized the governor for intentionally scaling back women's access to care and abortions in Ohio.\n\nDemocratic candidate for Lieutenant Governor Kesha Ram critiqued the governor in a press release over the weekend:.\n\n\"With Governor John Kasich\u2019s record of blocking women's access to health care and family planning, trying to deny Syrian refugees a sanctuary, and stalling progress on Ohio's renewable energy goals, I question his commitment to Vermont values and economic progress...Vermont has a proud history under Democratic leadership of supporting a woman's right to choose,\" Ram wrote.\n\nBut others credited the governor for not shying away from real issues. Mary Ellen Varhue is a science teacher from Georgia, Vermont.\n\n\u201cI was really impressed with him. I thought he talked substantially about things, and I haven\u2019t heard that a lot in some of the debates,\u201d said Varhue.\n\n\u201cI thought he took gutsy stances, not necessarily the party line, and I like that about him. He seems like an independent thinker and I\u2019m really interested to find more about him.\u201d\n\nKasich spent the morning of South Carolina\u2019s primary speaking with Vermont voters, but he told reporters his time was well spent. Vermont is one of a dozen states that will vote in the March 1 Super Tuesday primaries.", "article_metadata": {"category": "VPR News", "description": "Ohio Gov.
