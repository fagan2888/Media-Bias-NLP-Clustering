He believes that his mobile unit is the only one of its kind in the South East and possibly on the East Coast. He believes that personalizing Obamacare /ACA Enrollment through his Community Outreach Program will prompt more people to Enroll. Davis contends, \u201cPeople want someone to genuinely care for them and to guide them through the process \u2026not to treat them like a number\u201d. Mr. Davis, who attended Elizabeth State University and East Carolina University has been an Insurance Agent since 2001.
