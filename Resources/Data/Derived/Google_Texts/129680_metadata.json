Despite the way ObamaCare was rushed through Congress and signed into law by President Obama or the way low-income voters cast their ballots on Election Day, healthcare isn\u2019t free.\n\nAnd the bloodletting isn\u2019t over.\n\nExperts say that the co-ops are failing because of artificially low premiums, strict regulations and the old and sick signing up for free healthcare while the young and healthy sit things out choosing to pay a fine instead.\n\nThis lethal combination of facts \u2013 which critics said were self-evident when ObamaCare was forced on the American people \u2013 are on track to run the remaining state healthcare co-ops out of business before the end of next year.\n\n\u201cIn most cases, they priced too low relative to what their claims costs were going to be, that\u2019s what the operating margins were all about,\u201d said Thomas Miller, a fellow specializing in health care policy at the American Enterprise Institute.\n\n\u201cNow what made them attractive was they\u2019re offering lower premiums so more people want to sign up for that, but that\u2019s a dangerous proposition where you\u2019re making up your losses on volume.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re getting more people, but those extra enrollees you\u2019re bringing in are being underwritten at a loss.\u201d\n\nAli Meyer, writing for the Washington Free Beacon, quoted Nathan Nascimento, a senior policy adviser at Freedom Partners as saying:\n\n\u201cThe co-ops are losing more than they\u2019re bringing in because they\u2019re paying out for older, sicker populations and don\u2019t have enough younger, healthier people to help share the cost burden\u201d \u201cThis is in part because the monthly premiums set up by the co-ops were set artificially low compared to other plans.\u201d\n\n\u201cCo-op insurers are heavily subsidized and operate under strict regulations,\u201d he explains. \u201cThey\u2019re more heavily regulated than other insurance plans offered in the health care exchange.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you have artificially low premiums, a pool of people requiring more payouts, increased regulations, and reductions in risk corridor subsidies, it\u2019s the perfect storm of insolvency,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re a public option comprise concept that clearly does not work \u2013 a thought experiment that is not practical in reality.\u201d\n\nAkash Chougule, deputy director of policy at Americans for Prosperity, says that as costs continue to rise, less people will enroll, causing more co-ops to go out of business.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t require an advanced degree in economics to see why this is unsustainable.\u201d \u201cAs costs and premiums continue to increase, people will increasingly avoid enrolling.\n\nAnd as co-ops succumb to the reality of higher rates, they\u2019ll continue failing at their alarming pace.\u201d\n\nNascimento added that:\n\n\u201cMore co-ops will likely fail \u2013 they were doomed from the start.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re already seeing another coop collapse, this time in Utah, with 66,000 people losing their health care coverage and costing taxpayers more money \u2013 $89,650,303 to be exact.\u201d\n\nAs more state co-ops close down, people who bought into the idea of free or low-cost healthcare under ObamaCare will have fewer plan choices, could face higher co-pays and annual deductibles before \u201cfree healthcare\u201d kicks in and would likely be penalized by the federal government if they drop out of the system.\n\nOne story out of New York describes a nightmare for hundreds of cancer patients who lost access to their doctors at the world-renowned Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. According to New York Post report:\n\n\u201cHealth Republic Insurance of New York, which has lost $130 million dollars in 18 months, was the only ObamaCare exchange insurer contracted with the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan.\n\n250 Health Republic members receiving care at Sloan Kettering need to find a new insurer by November 15 that the hospital takes or prepare to shoulder the cost themselves. New York is forcing their carrier to close shop at the end of this month for losing so much money.\u201d\n\nDid someone say \u201cdeath panels\u201d?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Nearly half of all ObamaCare co-ops have collapsed \u2013 more could fail by year\u2019s end.", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Bob Conover", "og": {"site_name": "Liberty News Now", "description": "Nearly half of all ObamaCare co-ops have collapsed \u2013 more could fail by year\u2019s end.", "title": "Breaking: ObamaCare Is Collapsing", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.libertynewsnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/ObamaCare.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-11-12T12:48:52+00:00", "url": "http://www.libertynewsnow.com/breaking-obamacare-is-collapsing/article2633", "type": "article"}, "robots": "noodp", "ca_image": "http://www.libertynewsnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/ObamaCare-150x150.jpg", "article": {"section": "Featured", "tag": "Obamacare", "published_time": "2015-11-12T11:00:45+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-12T12:48:52+00:00"}, "ca_title": "Breaking: ObamaCare Is Collapsing", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The states that have seen their ObamaCare co-ops financially collapse include Utah, Kentucky, New York, Nevada, Louisiana, Oregon, Colorado, Tennessee, South Carolina and a co-op that served both Iowa and Nebraska.\nThe failures, which have come more quickly than even those who opposed to ObamaCare originally predicted, have proved one thing.\nDespite the way ObamaCare was rushed through Congress and signed into law by President Obama or the way low-income voters cast their ballots on Election Day, healthcare isn\u2019t free.\nNearly half of all ObamaCare co-ops have collapsed \u2013 more could fail by year\u2019s endCritics said that healthcare co-ops set up to dispense \u201cfree\u201d medical care to the nation\u2019s uninsured under ObamaCare would collapse and, so far, nearly half of them have \u2013 leaving millions of \u201cinsured\u201d Americans with nowhere to go when accidents or illnesses strike.\nThis lethal combination of facts \u2013 which critics said were self-evident when ObamaCare was forced on the American people \u2013 are on track to run the remaining state healthcare co-ops out of business before the end of next year."}
