(AP Photo)\n\nSince the Right to Work movement began more than six decades ago, Big Labor union bosses have gone to extraordinary measures to stop the spread of worker freedom.\n\nOne former union boss, Thomas E. Harris, actually gave a speech railing against worker freedom and branded Right to Work advocates as \u201cwarmongers!\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s true that Right to Work supporters have been fighting since the 1950\u2019s to end Big Labor\u2019s forced-dues funded empire, but Harris\u2019 incendiary speech was a familiar tactic of union bosses trying to vilify and demonize their opponents rather than justify forcing workers to pay the union or be fired.\n\nWest Virginia is now America\u2019s 26th Right to Work state, guaranteeing to Mountain State workers the right to get or keep a job without having to pay union dues or fees.\n\nAnd this has Big Labor nervous. West Virginia is the fourth new Right to Work state in four years, dealing yet another blow to Big Labor\u2019s chokehold over workers they claim to represent.\n\nUnsurprisingly, union bosses have been espousing false and nonsensical arguments against a West Virginia Right to Work law.\n\nBut one common refrain among forced unionism allies is just plain ridiculous. In fact, Thomas Harris even called it, \u201crather hypocritical \u2026 nonsense.\u201d\n\nAFL-CIO radio ads recently broadcast throughout the Mountain State insisted that a West Virginia Right to Work law would \u201cget the government deeper into our \u2026 business relationships.\u201d\n\nThis is just false.\n\nRight to Work laws do not increase government intervention in employee-employer relationships. They do, however, protect a workers\u2019 fundamental right to freedom of association.\n\nIronically, union bosses don\u2019t seem to have a problem that federal law prohibits contracts between employers and employees that prohibit unions in a workplace. It\u2019s only when Big Labor\u2019s special government-granted privilege to force a worker to pay union dues or fees as a condition of employment is challenged they union bosses cry foul, purporting to be defenders of free markets.\n\nSince 1932, federal law has prohibited so-called \u201cyellow-dog\u201d employment contracts \u2013 that is, contracts under which a worker agrees as a condition of employment that he will not join a union.\n\nBut even as it disallows \u201cyellow-dog\u201d arrangements, federal law authorizes and actively promotes the corralling into unions of workers who want nothing to do with a union.\n\nHarris had no problems with government permitting forced unionism, and even wanted to expand Big Labor\u2019s privileges.\n\nBut unlike the union propagandists trying to stop Right to Work in West Virginia, at least Harris didn\u2019t pretend to be a supporter of \u201cfreedom of contract.\u201d\n\nIn a speech delivered to the American Bar Association when he was still the CIO\u2019s associate general counsel, Harris admitted that he had once participated in the preparation of a pamphlet stating that Right to Work laws were \u201coutrageous because they regimented the type of contract the parties could enter into.\u201d\n\nBut this was \u201cof course \u2026 nonsense,\u201d Harris continued, because union officials \u201care not concerned in any abstract sense about government regimentation of the contents of collective bargaining agreements \u2026 .\u201d\n\nThough he didn\u2019t put it that way, for him and for the union brass, government \u201cregimentation\u201d of the workplace is just fine as long as the right ox is getting gored. And if the \u201cox\u201d is the ability of the independent-minded employee to remain union-free, Harris and his ilk have always said, \u201cChop away!\u201d\n\nThe hardworking men and women of West Virginia have endured compulsory unionism long enough. With over 80% of Americans agreeing that union dues or fees shouldn\u2019t be required to get or keep a job, it\u2019s clear that Big Labor\u2019s hypocritical Right to Work smear campaigns have failed.\n\nEvery Mountain State worker deserves, and now has, the right to decide for him or herself if paying money to a union boss is advantageous instead of being forced to pay under threat of losing their job.\n\nWelcome, West Virginia. You are now America\u2019s 26th Right to Work State.\n\nStan Greer is the senior research associate of the National Institute for Labor Relations Research.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "CNS News", "description": "Since the Right to Work movement began more than six decades ago, Big Labor union bosses have gone to extraordinary measures to stop the spread of worker freedom.", "title": "Union Bosses Spout Hypocrisy Trying to Protect Forced-Dues Empire in West Virginia", "url": "http://www.cnsnews.com/commentary/stan-greer/union-bosses-spout-hypocrisy-trying-protect-forced-dues-empire-west-virginia", "image": "//cdn.cnsnews.com/west_virginia_becomes_right_to_work_state_ap_photo.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-12T16:51:58-05:00", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-12T16:51:58-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-12T16:51:58-05:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Since the Right to Work movement began more than six decades ago, Big Labor union bosses have gone to extraordinary measures to stop the spread of worker freedom.", "title": "Union Bosses Spout Hypocrisy Trying to Protect Forced-Dues Empire in West Virginia", "url": "http://www.cnsnews.com/commentary/stan-greer/union-bosses-spout-hypocrisy-trying-protect-forced-dues-empire-west-virginia", "image": {"src": "http://cdn.cnsnews.com/west_virginia_becomes_right_to_work_state_ap_photo.jpg"}, "site": "@cnsnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "Since the Right to Work movement began more than six decades ago, Big Labor union bosses have gone to extraordinary measures to stop the spread of worker freedom.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Unsurprisingly, union bosses have been espousing false and nonsensical arguments against a West Virginia Right to Work law.\nWelcome, West Virginia.\nProtesters organize as West Virginia becomes 26th Right to Work state.\nWest Virginia is now America\u2019s 26th Right to Work state, guaranteeing to Mountain State workers the right to get or keep a job without having to pay union dues or fees.\nWest Virginia is the fourth new Right to Work state in four years, dealing yet another blow to Big Labor\u2019s chokehold over workers they claim to represent."}
