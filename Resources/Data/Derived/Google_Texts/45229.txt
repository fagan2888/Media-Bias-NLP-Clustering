When more than 100 CFOs of large North American companies were asked what is the most important priority they expect to accomplish for their companies by the end of 2016, they cited a heavy focus on helping their executive teams achieve key business priorities and deliver on the organization’s financial commitments, according in Deloitte’s first-quarter 2016 CFO Signals™ survey. When asked a similar question for their finance organizations, about half of the surveyed CFOs said their key accomplishments would be around how they acquire, develop and deploy talent.
