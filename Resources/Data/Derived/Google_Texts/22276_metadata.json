Even in Florida.\n\nIf you like your dead doctor, you can keep your dead doctor, but not if he or she is still billing Medicaid for your services.\n\nAnd once you\u2019re dead, it\u2019s probably best to ease up on the prescriptions and doctor visits.\n\n+ Frank Cerabino \u00d7\n\nJust saying. Suggestion: Try kale.\n\nThe study found 290 dead doctors in the four states still writing prescriptions for living patients and another group of 170 dead patients still getting government-reimbursed meds.\n\nIn all, it amounted to more than $100,000 in drugs prescribed either by or for the dead, the report found.\n\nIt concluded that this just might be a sign of \u201cpotential waste, fraud and abuse\u201d and suggested that states, which administer Medicaid, enact tougher controls.\n\n\u201cAutomatic refill prohibitions may help limit waste and unnecessary program expenditures,\u201d the report said.\n\nFlorida Medicaid doesn\u2019t allow automatic refills of pharmacy prescriptions. And Michigan officials offered a benign explanation for the activity of dead doctors in that state.\n\n\u201cMichigan Medicaid officials stated that there are instances in which a dead prescriber may appear to be billing after the day of death,\u201d the report said. \u201cIn their program, they stated that this is usually because another member of the physician\u2019s practice writes the prescription and the pharmacy does not update the physician information.\u201d\n\nBut there has already been some evidence that post-death medical spending has been going on for a while in Florida, especially during the frenzied heydays of Oxycontin abuse.\n\nMedicaid paid more than $63,000 for narcotics prescriptions from 108 Florida doctors who were either dead or barred from writing prescriptions, a 2000 investigation by the Sun-Sentinel newspaper found. In one case, a doctor who had been dead for five years, was still actively prescribing drugs.\n\nAnd in Georgia, an Atlanta doctor pleaded guilty four years ago to defrauding Medicaid by billing for psychological group therapy sessions to nursing home patients who had already died.\n\nDr. Robert Williams had billed the government for $2 million for therapy sessions at nursing homes during a two-year period.\n\n\u201cAn investigation of Williams\u2019 claims showed that, in many cases, he sought payment for services provided to beneficiaries who were deceased at the time he purportedly rendered the care,\u201d the FBI reported. \u201cIn two cases, the patient died over a year before he was allegedly seen by Williams in the nursing home.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a lesson here: Dead people need to pay for their own pick-me-up sessions.\n\nMaybe what is needed is a way to crystallize public awareness toward the understanding that the doctor-patient relationship should involve two living people.\n\nAnd whether you like Obamacare or not, we can all agree that the dead should be excluded from participating in our system of health care coverage.\n\nIt would be a rare health-care initiative with widespread support:\n\nNo GonerCare.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new government report examining Medicaid billings in Florida and three other states show that taxpayers have sometimes paid for drugs prescribed to dead people or drugs prescribed to living patients from dead doctors.", "author": "By Frank Cerabino - Palm Beach Post Staff Writer", "og": {"url": "http://www.mypalmbeachpost.com/news/news/cerabino-whats-up-with-dead-docs-writing-drug-pres/nnHZ9/", "image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2015/08/11/f4/d0/Column-mug.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A new government report examining Medicaid billings in Florida and three other states show that taxpayers have sometimes paid for drugs prescribed to dead people or drugs prescribed to living patients from dead doctors.", "title": "Drug prescriptions for dead people total thousands of dollars"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/resize/120x120/img/photos/2015/08/11/f4/d0/Column-mug.jpg", "description": "A new government report examining Medicaid billings in Florida and three other states show that taxpayers have sometimes paid for drugs prescribed to dead people or drugs prescribed to living patients from dead doctors.", "card": "summary", "title": "Cerabino: What\u2019s up with dead docs writing drug prescriptions?"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "mypbp", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.mypalmbeachpost.com/news/news/cerabino-whats-up-with-dead-docs-writing-drug-pres/nnHZ9/"}, "cmg_revpath": "/re/292/3022851/news/news/cerabino-whats-up-with-dead-docs-writing-drug-pres/nnHZ9/", "keywords": "cerabino,allpbc", "viewport": "shrink-to-fit=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "If you like your dead doctor, you can keep your dead doctor, but not if he or she is still billing Medicaid for your services.\nThe study found 290 dead doctors in the four states still writing prescriptions for living patients and another group of 170 dead patients still getting government-reimbursed meds.\nAnd once you\u2019re dead, it\u2019s probably best to ease up on the prescriptions and doctor visits.\nIn all, it amounted to more than $100,000 in drugs prescribed either by or for the dead, the report found.\nMedicaid paid more than $63,000 for narcotics prescriptions from 108 Florida doctors who were either dead or barred from writing prescriptions, a 2000 investigation by the Sun-Sentinel newspaper found."}
