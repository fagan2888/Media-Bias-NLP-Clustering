In the analysis, 17 independent genes appeared to influence tastes for foods including artichokes, bacon, coffee, chicory, dark chocolate, blue cheese, ice cream, liver, oil or butter on bread, orange juice, plain yogurt, white wine, and mushrooms.\n\nYet none of those genes belonged to genetic categories associated with receptors for the senses of taste or smell, suggesting a far greater complexity, according to Pirastu.\n\n\"There is still much that needs to be done to understand what are the characteristics of certain foods affected by the genetic makeup of an individual,\" he said in the statement. \"For example, we found a strong correlation between the HLA-DOA gene and white wine liking, but we have no idea which of the characteristics of white wine this gene influences.\u201d\n\nThe work may also provide new insights into the study of obesity, which typically focuses more on human physiology rather than one\u2019s taste preferences for food, otherwise known as gluttony.\n\n\u201cAlthough there has been a lot of work on food-related diseases such as obesity, this has rarely taken food preferences into account, Pirastu said. \u201cThis is a major limitation which our work attempts to remedy, and as yet, we have only really scratched the surface of this issue.\"\n\nIn the second part of the study, the researchers found a correlation between salt preferences among 900 healthy adults from northeastern Italy and a DNA sequence variation on the KCNA5 gene, a known associated with genetic preferences for salt in mammals. Not surprisingly, such genetically based preferences for salt have been pinpointed as a risk factor for hypertension and cardiovascular disease, Robino says.\n\n\u201cGenetic variations for taste perception are well known for bitter, sweet, and umami taste, but until now we knew little about their role in salt perception and liking,\" she said. \"Identifying the receptor associated with individual differences in the perception of salt could help us better understand how chemosensory differences can interact to influence and predict food choices, and hence, human nutritional behavior.\u201d\n\nWith a greater understanding of genetics, the researchers hope industries will work to meet the emerging dietary requirements of the new age.\n\nSource: Pirastu, N., Robino, A.
