There is good reason to believe that these newly legalized illegals might very well be eligible for Social Security and other federal benefits such as Medicare.\n\nIn a report in the Washington Post for November 25, the paper\u2019s national political correspondent, Karen Tumulty, first looked at the president\u2019s words for a clue about what might lie ahead. Obama had stated:\n\nWe\u2019re going to offer the following deal: If you\u2019ve been in America more than five years, if you have children who are American citizens or illegal residents, if you register, pass a criminal background check and you\u2019re willing to pay your fair share of taxes, you\u2019ll be able to apply to stay in this country temporarily without fear of deportation. You can come out of the shadows and get right with the law.\n\nIn a commentary on the president\u2019s reference to the newly legalized recipients of his beneficence, Rachel Bade, a writer for Politico, provided her best interpretation of what the ramifications of Obama\u2019s statement, \u201cpay your fair share of taxes,\u201d will be. She noted that a White House outline on the president\u2019s program doesn\u2019t provide much detail beyond that statement. She wrote:\n\nMost experts, however, assume the 5 million will pay everything that a typical U.S. citizen would pay: payroll, income, sales and property taxes. But they\u2019ll also likely get to claim the child tax credit and the earned income tax credit, although the Obama administration said they won\u2019t get Obamacare tax credits or certain welfare benefits.\n\nThe Post's Tumulty added:\n\nFederal law says that people who pay the [payroll] taxes and are deemed \u201clawfully present in the United States\u201d can collect benefits under those programs when they become eligible. They may also receive survivor and disability benefits.\n\n\u201cIf they pay in, they can draw,\u201d White House spokesman Shawn Turner said by e-mail.\n\nTurner noted, however, that the estimated 5 million immigrants granted protection from deportation will not be eligible for other federal benefits such as student financial aid, food stamps or housing subsidies. Nor are they eligible to purchase health insurance through the federal health-care exchange under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThis last point will create a very serious dilemma for American workers, however. As we noted in our earlier article \u201cUnder ObamaCare, Businesses Can Save $3,000 By Hiring Illegals,\u201d \"Since these illegal immigrants granted the right to remain in America under the Obama executive action are ineligible to buy insurance through the federal Health Insurance Marketplace, employers who hire them are exempted from paying the fines.\"\n\nThe fines of $3,000 a year are imposed on larger employers who fail to provide \u201caffordable, adequate\u201d healthcare coverage for each full-time worker getting a premium tax credit. Since employers face paying fines for not covering eligible (legal) employees but will not be fined for failing to provide coverage for newly legalized aliens not eligible for ObamaCare coverage, this provides a $3,000 incentive for them to hire those who came here illegally.\n\nObamaCare and the presidential executive actions are combining to create an ever-worsening situation for American job hunters and those relying on a financially tenuous Social Security program. The Obama administration has just made it financially more advantageous for employers to hire illegal aliens who have been granted amnesty \u2014 and now will enable those same illegals to become eligible to collect Social Security and Medicare benefits.\n\nOne might argue that illegal immigrants, if they work and pay FICA taxes, should be eligible for the benefits just as an American citizen who pays into the system is eligible. While it is true that they will be \"paying in,\" the real problem with this scenario goes much deeper. This is one more step to offering illegal immigrants de facto citizenship. People who came into this country illegally will, by virtue of the fact that they have been here for a number of years and are working, be paying taxes and receiving benefits just as any American citizen. The logical next step would be to say, \"why not just make them all citizens.\"\n\nThis entire concept erodes the idea of borders, immigration laws, and national citizenship. It is one step closer to a North American Union achieved by stealth and inertia rather than by decree, as the distinction between nations becomes less and less obvious.\n\nRelated articles:\n\nImmigration Speech: Does Obama See Himself as an Elected Dictator?\n\nObama and Republicans Spar Over Immigration Executive Action Plans\n\nEssential Immigration Reform\n\nObama Will Use Executive Action to \u201cSpur\u201d Congress on Immigration Reform\n\nObama Pursues Plan to Implement \u201cImmigration Reform\u201d Unilaterally\n\nCivil-rights Commissioner Says Obama Immigration Plan Will Hurt Black Workers\n\nAccused Cop-killer Was Twice-deported Illegal Immigrant\n\nGOP Divided Over Immigration Reform\n\nCivil Rights Commission to Probe Effect of State Illegal Immigration Laws\n\nObama Delays Immigration Action Until After Elections\n\nObama Executive Action Will Allow Illegal Immigrants in Military\n\nMore Illegal Alien Children Coming Soon, Predicts Think Tank Spokesman\n\nEstimated Cost of Educating New Illegal Children at $760 Million\n\nIllegal Immigrant Kids May Overwhelm U.S. Schools\n\nIllegal Immigrant Children Fail to Show at Immigration Hearings\n\nRelocation of Illegal Immigrant Minors Stirs Negative Reaction\n\nFeds Sending Illegal Immigrant Minors to States Without Notice\n\nTexas Sheriff: Groups of Armed Illegal Immigrants in His County\n\nDHS: Flow of Illegal Immigrants Encouraged by U.S. Failure to Deport\n\nFlood of Illegal Immigrants Now Includes Gang Members\n\nObama Opens Borders, Releases Illegal Immigrants Into U.S.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Illegal aliens, amnesty, Obama, executive actions, collect, Social Security, federal benefits, Medicare", "og": {"url": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/immigration/item/19612-closer-to-citizenship-illegal-immigrants-might-get-social-security", "image": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/media/k2/items/cache/a9ab531dde82ff9a3c9bff13cffddb5f_XL.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Illegal immigrants granted amnesty by President Obama through executive actions might be eligible to collect Social Security and other federal benefits such as Medicare. by Warren Mass", "title": "Closer to Citizenship: Illegal Immigrants Might Get Social Security"}, "image": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/media/k2/items/cache/a9ab531dde82ff9a3c9bff13cffddb5f_XL.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe465a\"", "article_summary": "Obama and Republicans Spar Over Immigration Executive Action PlansEssential Immigration ReformObama Will Use Executive Action to \u201cSpur\u201d Congress on Immigration ReformObama Pursues Plan to Implement \u201cImmigration Reform\u201d UnilaterallyCivil-rights Commissioner Says Obama Immigration Plan Will Hurt Black WorkersAccused Cop-killer Was Twice-deported Illegal ImmigrantGOP Divided Over Immigration ReformCivil Rights Commission to Probe Effect of State Illegal Immigration LawsObama Delays Immigration Action Until After ElectionsObama Executive Action Will Allow Illegal Immigrants in MilitaryMore Illegal Alien Children Coming Soon, Predicts Think Tank SpokesmanEstimated Cost of Educating New Illegal Children at $760 MillionIllegal Immigrant Kids May Overwhelm U.S. SchoolsIllegal Immigrant Children Fail to Show at Immigration HearingsRelocation of Illegal Immigrant Minors Stirs Negative ReactionFeds Sending Illegal Immigrant Minors to States Without NoticeTexas Sheriff: Groups of Armed Illegal Immigrants in His CountyDHS: Flow of Illegal Immigrants Encouraged by U.S. Failure to DeportFlood of Illegal Immigrants Now Includes Gang MembersObama Opens Borders, Releases Illegal Immigrants Into U.S.\nViewers who watched President Obama\u2019s November 20 speech outlining his plan to grant amnesty (though he denied it is amnesty) to illegal immigrants may have wondered if his plan would enable those immigrants to collect Social Security benefits.\nThis is one more step to offering illegal immigrants de facto citizenship.\nOne might argue that illegal immigrants, if they work and pay FICA taxes, should be eligible for the benefits just as an American citizen who pays into the system is eligible.\nThere is good reason to believe that these newly legalized illegals might very well be eligible for Social Security and other federal benefits such as Medicare."}
