(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Both Republicans and Democrats support a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision to send back to appeals courts cases challenging Obamacare mandates that require coverage of contraception based on religious grounds, asking the panels to try to find compromise solutions to the disputes.\n\nAt the National Catholic Prayer Breakfast Tuesday, U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan praised Monday\u2019s unanimous decision by the high court. The ruling absolved employers like the Little Sisters of the Poor, a Catholic charity group, from facing fines for failing to meet the mandates of the Affordable Care Act while the cases are pending.\n\nBut Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, said the Obama administration has displayed a \u201ctotal misunderstanding of faith\u201d in demanding that religious nonprofits must provide coverage for birth control and abortions, even when that contravenes their religious beliefs.\n\n\u201cLiving out our faith gives us joy,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cThat is why we object when government restricts religious liberty. When faith is ruled out of bounds, then happiness itself is being placed out of reach.\u201d\n\nHe suggested that the Little Sisters, a group of nuns which provides nursing home care in dozens of U.S. cities, including Somerville, took admirable action to push for its rights as a religious organization.\n\n\u201cI think we can all agree that they are doing some of the most noble work out there,\u201d Ryan explained, to applause from the audience. \u201cYet, the administration has been trying to force them to offer benefits that violate their beliefs. The sisters have tried to negotiate with this administration, and frankly, its response has shown a total misunderstanding of faith.\u201d\n\nHowever, in an exclusive interview with Buzzfeed.com following the decision, President Barack Obama cited the decision as a win for religious freedom and for women. Women can still obtain contraception while the religious plans are protected by the court from penalties for not complying with the mandate, he said.\n\n\u201cThe practical effect is right now, that women will still continue to be able to get contraception, if they are getting health insurance,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we are properly accommodating religious institutions who have objections to contraception.\u201d\n\nSome, like the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, a Washington-based advocacy group that represented the Little Sisters, put a positive interpretation on Obama\u2019s words.\n\n\u201cI wish HHS had reached the same conclusion five years ago that President Obama did yesterday,\u201d Mark Rienzi, a Becket lawyer, said, referring to the U.S. Health and Human Services Department. \u201cBut the president\u2019s acknowledgment that any woman who wants free contraception can already get it \u2018right now\u2019 \u2013 while the Little Sisters are under court protection against a forced takeover of their health plan \u2013 should effectively end this debate over whether the HHS mandate was necessary to providing women access to these services.\u201d\n\nThe government exempts 1-in-3 Americans from the Obamacare mandate, according to Becket. Also exempted are large corporations such as Exxon, Visa as well as the government\u2019s own military family health plan.\n\nContact Kara Bettis at [email protected] or on Twitter @karabettis.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.", "article_metadata": {"shareaholic": {"site_name": "NewBostonPost", "language": "en-US", "url": "http://newbostonpost.com/2016/05/19/obamacare-punt-by-high-court-gives-hope-to-both-sides/", "article_author_name": "Kara Bettis", "image": "http://newbostonpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/GOP-2016-Congress-_Jank.jpg", "site_id": "ab905d8abdbd23a369259b08e0927728", "shareable_page": "true", "keywords": "abortion, Catholic orders, congress, contraception, faith, health care, HHS, Little Sisters of the Poor, Obamacare, Paul Ryan, President Barack Obama, regulation, religion, religious groups, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, U.S. Supreme Court"}, "description": "Both Republicans and Democrats support a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision to send back to appeals courts cases challenging Obamacare mandates that require", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"image": "http://newbostonpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/GOP-2016-Congress-_Jank.jpg"}, "keywords": "abortion,catholic orders,congress,contraception,faith,health care,hhs,little sisters of the poor,obamacare,paul ryan,president barack obama,regulation,religion,religious groups,u.s. department of health and human services,u.s. supreme court", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Obamacare punt by high court gives hope to both sidesPrinted from: http://newbostonpost.com/2016/05/19/obamacare-punt-by-high-court-gives-hope-to-both-sides/House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Republican of Wisconsin, spoke Tuesday about the U.S. Supreme Court's handling of faith-based challenges to Obamacare mandates.\nAt the National Catholic Prayer Breakfast Tuesday, U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan praised Monday\u2019s unanimous decision by the high court.\nThe ruling absolved employers like the Little Sisters of the Poor, a Catholic charity group, from facing fines for failing to meet the mandates of the Affordable Care Act while the cases are pending.\nWomen can still obtain contraception while the religious plans are protected by the court from penalties for not complying with the mandate, he said.\nAlso exempted are large corporations such as Exxon, Visa as well as the government\u2019s own military family health plan."}
