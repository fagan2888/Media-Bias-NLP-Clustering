National Suicide Prevention week begins Monday and Panama City is already raising awareness.

Saturday hundreds of people met at Gulf Coast State College for the 3rd Annual Bridge of Hope Awareness walk which is sponsored by SPARE.

It is a coalition whose main goal is to eliminate suicide in the community.

One of the founders was inspired after losing her son to suicide seven years ago.

"So I want to give the warning signs out there and the risk factors out there, to as many people as I can so they can help a friend, neighbor, or even a stranger if they see him in distress," said Karen Abrahams, of SPARE.
