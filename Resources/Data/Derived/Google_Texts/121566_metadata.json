John Walsh (D-Mont.) and Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) introduced the bill, which would give companies incentives to bringing jobs back to the United States, including a tax write off for the relocating costs and an additional 20 percent credit.\n\nCurrently, U.S. companies can deduct from their corporate taxes some expenses of moving facilities overseas. Democrats said 2.4 million jobs have been outsourced in the past 10 years.\n\nRepublicans argue that if Democrats truly wanted to keep companies in the United States, they would work with Republicans to overhaul the tax code and reduce corporate tax rates.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bill that\u2019s designed for campaign rhetoric and failure \u2014 not to create jobs here in the U.S.,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said. \u201cEveryone knows that the Democrats aren\u2019t being serious here.\u201d\n\nThe legislation was part of Democrats\u2019 \u201cFair Shot\u201d campaign ahead of the midterm elections. If Republicans vote against cloture, Democrats will likely use the vote against them in November, saying Republicans support big business more than creating middle-class jobs.\n\nWalsh is one of the most vulnerable incumbents this election cycle. His opponent, Rep. Steve Daines (R-Mont.), ran Procter & Gamble factories in China. Walsh\u2019s campaign has argued that Daines helped ship jobs overseas.\n\n\u201cIt is outrageous that Americans are forced to subsidize corporate decisions to ship jobs overseas,\u201d Walsh said. \u201cThis is a fundamentally wrong policy.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) blocked Republicans from offering amendments to a bill that would end tax breaks for companies that send jobs overseas.", "description": "Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) blocked Republicans from offering amendments to a bill that would end tax breaks for companies that send jobs overseas.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Floor Action"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) blocked Republicans from offering amendments to a bill that would end tax breaks for companies that send jobs overseas.", "title": "Reid blocks GOP amendments to outsourcing bill", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/213550-reid-blocks-gop-amendments-to-outsourcing-bill", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-07-28T18:16:32-04:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2014-07-28T18:16-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/213550-reid-blocks-gop-amendments-to-outsourcing-bill", "dcterms.date": "2014-07-28T18:16-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Ramsey Cox", "author": "Ramsey Cox", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Mitch McConnell, Debbie Stabenow,John Walsh,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-28T18:16:34-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-28T18:16:32-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/213550-reid-blocks-gop-amendments-to-outsourcing-bill", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) blocked Republicans from offering amendments to a bill that would end tax breaks for companies that send jobs overseas.", "card": "summary", "title": "Reid blocks GOP amendments to outsourcing bill"}, "dcterms.title": "Reid blocks GOP amendments to outsourcing bill"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe need a list of amendments and a path to getting the bill done,\u201d Reid said last week.\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) blocked Republicans from offering amendments to a bill that would end tax breaks for companies that send jobs overseas.\nADVERTISEMENTReid said he wanted Republicans to come up with a finite list of amendments so that the Senate could move on to other legislative matters, but Republicans wanted an open amendment process.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bill that\u2019s designed for campaign rhetoric and failure \u2014 not to create jobs here in the U.S.,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said.\n\u201cEveryone knows that the Democrats aren\u2019t being serious here.\u201dThe legislation was part of Democrats\u2019 \u201cFair Shot\u201d campaign ahead of the midterm elections."}
