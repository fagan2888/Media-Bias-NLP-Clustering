It\u2019s helped my perspective,\u201d said Rob Reed, 47. He will become the fifth CEO in the company\u2019s 112 years. His father, 75, will become chairman-elect and will remain as an adviser to the company.\n\nRob Reed\u2019s plan includes a familiar mantra: \u201cFirst, do no harm.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re on a wonderful pathway,\u201d Reed said, with assets reaching an all-time high of $3.2 billion and, last year, premiums and investment revenue of $850 million and net income of $42 million.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t been saving up all these things that I\u2019ve wanted to do,\u201d Reed said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to do anything crazy.\u201d\n\nPhysicians Mutual\u2019s teams will continue working on existing products and looking for new ones, he said. \u201cWe\u2019re wanting people to go out and dream about things beyond what we normally do.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s fastest-growing product is dental insurance, launched in 2003 mostly because of demand among senior citizens because Medicare doesn\u2019t cover most dental work.\n\nThe company added \u201cpre-need\u201d insurance for funeral expenses in 2012, sold through local funeral homes.\n\nA possible new product: Vision coverage, also requested by many of Physicians Mutual\u2019s policyholders, who are its owners under the mutual ownership model.\n\nThe company\u2019s other main offerings are Medicare supplement and hospitalization coverage, with smaller lines of supplemental health products, including limited benefits, mini-medical, cancer and critical illness coverage, plus life insurance and annuities through its Physicians Life Insurance Co.\n\nFinancial ratings firm A.M. Best Co. lists Physicians Mutual as an \u201cA\u201d company, the third-highest financial strength level on a 16-level scale.\n\nBest said the company\u2019s revenue dropped for a time before 2011 as premiums declined in the increasingly competitive hospital insurance market. Competition for Medicare supplement insurance also has grown.\n\nBut premium revenue has grown a total of 23 percent since then, alongside higher investment income.\n\nReed said the focus on people near or at retirement age has led to a diverse mix of financial products, often starting with people who are thinking about retirement and realize they need to become better informed.\n\n\u201cWe have to sell a person at the end, but we like to start with education,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s complicated stuff.\u201d\n\nDr. William Hamsa, chairman of Physicians Mutual\u2019s board of directors, said Reed is \u201can accomplished business leader with a combination of financial and operational acumen, making him uniquely positioned to lead the company.\u201d\n\nHamsa said the leadership change \u201ccomes at a time of strength and growth.\u201d He is due to step down from the chairmanship in 2016, with Bob Reed becoming chairman.\n\nDuring Bob Reed\u2019s tenure as CEO, Physicians Mutual\u2019s assets grew from $54 million to $3.2 billion; annual premiums collected rose from $72 million to $700 million; and annual benefits paid increased from $49 million to $461 million.\n\nEmployment totaled 450 when he became CEO. Since 1993, when the company\u2019s employment peaked at nearly 1,400, expanded use of computer programs has increased productivity, such as its automated claims system, and slimmed the workforce.\n\nE.E. Elliott started the company in 1902 to provide health insurance for doctors and their staffs. The physician focus continues through its board of directors. Besides the Reeds and Hamsa, they are Drs. John Woodbury, Dale Brett, James Canedy and Martin Mancuso.\n\nThat tradition will continue, Rob Reed said, preserving access to the doctors\u2019 valuable medical insights.\n\nReed has degrees from Georgetown University and the Kellogg Graduate School of Management at Northwestern University. He and his wife, Stacie, have five children, the oldest two in college.\n\nIn Omaha, he has worked with the Red Cross, Completely Kids, Heartland Family Service, the YMCA, the Jesuit Partnership Council of Omaha, Community Health Charities and the United Way of the Midlands, the Knights of Ak-Sar-Ben, the Omaha Symphony and the River City Rodeo & Stock Show.\n\nWhile Mutual of Omaha may have more name recognition and National Indemnity Co. is part of a larger parent company \u2014 Berkshire Hathaway Inc. \u2014 Physicians Mutual\u2019s public profile increased in Omaha in 1987, when it purchased the former headquarters of Enron Corp. at 2600 Dodge St.\n\nEnron\u2019s predecessor, InterNorth Inc., had spent $36 million to clear 17 acres of land and build the marble-clad structure, which opened in 1985. Soon after, Enron moved its headquarters to Houston and put the building up for sale.\n\nPhysicians Mutual paid $17 million, plus $2 million for the furnishings, and moved from its much-smaller office near the University of Nebraska Medical Center.\n\n\u201cThe price was right,\u201d Rob Reed said. Today the property is valued at just over $12.5 million for tax purposes.\n\nThe building is nearly full with the company\u2019s 900 Omaha employees. An additional 100 staff members operate regional sales offices to serve the independent \u201ccareer\u201d agents who are an important sales force. The company also sells its products by mail and over the Internet.\n\nContact the writer: 402-444-1080, steve.jordon@owh.com, twitter.com/buffettOWH", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Omaha.com", "description": "Physicians Mutual Group will have a new top executive on Jan. 1 for the first time in 40 years.", "title": "Physicians Mutual CEO to hand reins to son", "url": "http://www.omaha.com/money/physicians-mutual-ceo-to-hand-reins-to-son/article_3873b1dc-3834-11e4-b07f-0017a43b2370.html", "image": {"width": 610, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/omaha.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/5/93/593ba310-3795-11e4-9d3e-0017a43b2370/540e0f3cbbaa0.image.jpg?resize=610%2C400", "height": 400}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@OWHnews", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Physicians Mutual Group will have a new top executive on Jan. 1 for the first time in 40 years.", "fb": {"app_id": 117714391577072}, "keywords": "money", "google-site-verification": "gE-kSjgMAF16OyUU3QCB0Ap0PQnFlh5oPdueJO6D2cQ", "news_keywords": "money"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2d0f\"", "article_summary": "Physicians Mutual Group will have a new top executive on Jan. 1 for the first time in 40 years.\nPhysicians Mutual paid $17 million, plus $2 million for the furnishings, and moved from its much-smaller office near the University of Nebraska Medical Center.\nA possible new product: Vision coverage, also requested by many of Physicians Mutual\u2019s policyholders, who are its owners under the mutual ownership model.\n\u201cRob\u201d Reed, the son of Robert A.\nIn the 25 years since then, Rob Reed has worked in virtually every department of the 1,000-employee Physicians Mutual, joining its board of directors in 2005 and serving as chief operating officer, the No."}
