Apparently Ms. Telnaes believes that if Hamas deliberately places rockets used to attack Israel in schools, hospitals, mosques, and private residences, then they are off limits to Israeli attack. The Jews should just let Hamas fire their rockets into heavily populated areas and take their medicine.

Perhaps Ms. Telnaes is such a historical illiterate that she is unfamiliar with the centuries of blood libels of Jews using the blood of non-Jewish babies to bake their Passover matzos. That would be the charitable interpretation.

However, Ms. Telnaes is a left wing ideologue who stoops to the deliberately mocking use of religious imagery against believing Christians as well.

Iâ€™d be very, very surprised indeed if she tried this with regard to the beliefs of Muslims, however.
