Russia was seen as an important player in the talks, in part because it was seen as sympathetic to Iran.\n\nRelated: Even More Evidence We\u2019re in a New Cold War\n\nRussia and Iran have a historically complicated relationship, but the two countries have grown closer in recent years. Iranian leaders have praised Russian President Vladimir Putin for his willingness to stand up to Western powers, particularly the United States.\n\nAccording to the government-owned news agency TASS the head of Rostec announced the possible missile deal on Monday. At an arms show in Abu Dhabi, Rostec CEO Sergey Chemezov said a deal with Iran for the Antey-2500 missile system was on the table.\n\nIn the face of objections from Western nations, Russia had cancelled the sale to Iran of a different system, known as the S-300, in 2010 \u2013 a decision that greatly angered leaders in Tehran. The Antey-2500 is an upgraded version of the S-300, with a range of more than 150 miles. (Russia\u2019s own military uses an even more powerful version of the Antey-2500.) The price tag on the Antey-2500, which Russia has already sold to Venezuela, is $1 billion per system.\n\nRelated: Europe Chickens Out Over Ukraine Ceasefire Violations\n\n\"As far as Iran is concerned, we have offered Antey-2500 instead of S-300. No decision has been made yet,\" Chemezov reportedly said.\n\nThe timing of the announcement is particularly odd because Russia is a member of the so-called P5 + 1 group of countries that has been negotiating with Iran in hopes of getting the Islamic Republic to scale back its enrichment of uranium.\n\nBecause Iran\u2019s leaders have repeatedly called for the destruction of Israel, the prospect of Tehran amassing the materials and technology necessary to build nuclear weapons is a subject of intense concern to Israel and its allies. Israel has also been openly hostile to the deal taking shape in the P5+1 talks, which would allow Iran to retain the capacity to enrich some uranium. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to give a controversial speech to the U.S. Congress next month highlighting what he sees as the danger of a \u201cbad\u201d deal with Iran.\n\nRelated: Why Putin May Be the Lesser of All Russian Evils\n\nIsrael has used its formidable air power to destroy Iranian nuclear facilities in the past, and has indicated that it reserves the right to do so in the future should it feel that the Iranian nuclear program poses an imminent threat.\n\nThe possibility that Iran\u2019s anti-aircraft capabilities might receive a major upgrade just as a nuclear deal that Israel already opposes is coming together is sure to generate more angst in Jerusalem and, according to some, raises questions about Russia\u2019s good faith in the negotiations.\n\n\u201cIt is certainly troubling that Russia is making these offers during the negotiations,\u201d said Anna Borshchevskaya, an adjunct fellow with the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. On the question of Russia\u2019s commitment to a deal, she added, \u201cIt ought to raise some doubts.\u201d\n\nRelated: Putin Sent Weapons to Ukraine Rebels Amid Peace Talks\n\nBorshchevskaya said that Russia, \u201ccontinues to not see Iran\u2019s nuclear program as much of a threat as we do in the west.\u201d\n\nRussia has provided Iran with expert assistance in the construction of its existing nuclear facilities, and last month signed a deal to build as many as eight more.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "As another round of sensitive talks on Iran\u2019s nuclear program were concluding, a top Russian arms manufacturer announced its offer to sell Iran advanced anti-aircraft missiles \u2013 a move that will likely make the deal even less palatable to Israel.", "title": "Putin Throws Wrench in Iran Nuke Talks", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/23/Putin-Throws-Wrench-Iran-Nuke-Talks", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/hungary-putin_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/23/Putin-Throws-Wrench-Iran-Nuke-Talks", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/hungary-putin_2.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "As another round of sensitive talks on Iran\u2019s nuclear program were concluding, a top Russian arms manufacturer announced its offer to sell Iran advanced anti-aircraft missiles \u2013 a move that will likely make the deal even less palatable to Israel.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5c02\"", "article_summary": "Russia was seen as an important player in the talks, in part because it was seen as sympathetic to Iran.\nRelated: Europe Chickens Out Over Ukraine Ceasefire Violations\"As far as Iran is concerned, we have offered Antey-2500 instead of S-300.\nAt an arms show in Abu Dhabi, Rostec CEO Sergey Chemezov said a deal with Iran for the Antey-2500 missile system was on the table.\nIranian leaders have praised Russian President Vladimir Putin for his willingness to stand up to Western powers, particularly the United States.\nIsrael has also been openly hostile to the deal taking shape in the P5+1 talks, which would allow Iran to retain the capacity to enrich some uranium."}
