The website also comes following a report that taxpayer dollars are being used to potentially fund abortion.\n\n\u201cDuring this time Americans can sign up for Obamacare plans and many will receive taxpayer-funded subsidies to help pay for these plans,\u201d reads a description on the Abortion in Obamacare website. \u201cThe Government Accountability Office (GAO) has found that 1,036 of Obamacare plans sold in 2014 included abortion on demand.\u201d\n\nThe website and interactive map pledge to help Americans dig deeper to discern whether abortion is covered in prospective plans they are considering \u2014 a task that the Family Research Council and the Charlotte Lozier Institute claim is currently difficult due to a lack of transparency.\n\n\u201cThis is critical information since individuals purchasing plans that include abortion are required to pay a hidden abortion surcharge,\u201d the website reads. \u201cThrough the surcharge, a portion of each individual\u2019s insurance premium goes into a fund used to pay for abortion on demand.\u201d\n\nThe organizations do caution that the information presented is limited, but that they are scouring the Internet and contacting insurance companies in an effort to provide comprehensive data.\n\nVisit the Abortion in Obamacare website here.\n\n(H/T: Live Action News)", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "gplus-count": 5, "twitter": {"description": "A new website aims to educate Americans about which plans under Obamacare cover abortion, providing detailed information about the current parameters for insurance carriers.
