That includes psychiatrists who treat depression and anxiety that often come with addiction, as well as the emergency department, inpatient detoxification unit and 24-hour security.\n\nLike other upscale seaside communities, Newport Beach and bordering Costa Mesa have a high concentration of sober-living facilities that market themselves as tranquil havens for recovery. Many are small enough to bypass state regulation, and at times their clients end up in Hoag\u2019s emergency room after overdoses or injuries, said Dr. Michael Brant-Zawadzki, who heads the Neurosciences Institute, which oversees addiction treatment.\n\n\u201cThere are the occasional cases where the homes are not equipped to handle people acting out,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a serious illness.\u201d\n\nBrant-Zawadzki said Hoag wanted to provide a medically based, responsible alternative. SolMar offers stays of 30, 60 or 90 days and accepts insurance, in contrast to the often cash-only business model for rehab, which can run up to $50,000, officials said.\n\n\u201cMost of the community can and will access us through their insurance,\u201d said psychotherapist Marshall Moncrief, the program\u2019s director.\n\nFor patients who enter without insurance coverage, the fee will be $18,500 for 30 days.\n\nDespite the surge in addiction, Dr. Kelly Clark, president-elect of the American Society of Addiction Medicine, said there\u2019s a shortage of medical providers and treatment.\n\n\u201cIn as much as mental health care has been stigmatized and marginalized, addiction care has been even more so,\u201d said Clark, who practices in Kentucky. \u201cAs a culture, we blame people for their addiction the way we used to blame people for their seizure disorder or schizophrenia or dementia or other brain diseases.\u201d\n\nThe new facility is a two-minute walk from Hoag\u2019s inpatient detox unit, which medically supervises withdrawal from alcohol, prescription opiates and street drugs, usually over five to seven days. SolMar is intended to be a seamless transition for those who need residential rehab.\n\nDr. Steven Ey, an addiction medicine specialist and medical director of SolMar, said only about 10 percent to 20 percent of those detox patients enter residential treatment programs after their hospitalization.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m confident that will go up quite a bit with our program opening up,\u201d Ey said. \u201cInsurance will cover it. They\u2019ll know they\u2019re still connected with Hoag.\u201d\n\nHoag received state approval to open the rehab facility last week and has had three patients enter after completing detox. It will open to outside patients Sept. 1.\n\nRobert Mann, marketing director of Clean Path Recovery, which provides sober-living and post-rehab care in Costa Mesa, said he welcomed the addition of Hoag because of the need for structured, reputable treatment.\n\n\u201cThe more people that create good programs that have these high standards and offer them to people who are struggling to get the help they need, that\u2019s really a wonderful thing,\u201d Mann said.\n\nThe 10,000-square-foot building housing SolMar was remodeled with a beach theme, including seaside photos taken by local residents who attend Hoag\u2019s outpatient recovery programs. The entrance looks like a hotel lobby. Meals are served family-style.\n\nEy said he expects many SolMar patients will have multiple addictions. About half will likely be professionals with drug or alcohol dependency, and the remainder young adults dealing with opiate addiction along with mental health conditions.\n\n\u201cWe increasingly see adults of all ages and backgrounds,\u201d Ey said.\n\nThat observation is backed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which in July said heroin use and overdose deaths have increased among all income levels, both genders and most age groups. Nearly half of heroin users are addicted to prescription opiate painkillers, according to the CDC, which also said that death from prescription overdoses has become an epidemic in the last decade.\n\nOpioid overdoses caused the deaths of 263 Orange County residents in 2014.\n\nClark said she\u2019s not sure if more hospitals will follow Hoag\u2019s lead and open residential programs. But she noted some have branched into other areas of medicine, such as hospice or skilled nursing homes.\n\n\u201cI think it will depend on what the experience is of some of these early attempts to increase the rehab beds,\u201d Clark said.\n\nContact the writer: 714-796-3686 or cperkes@ocregister.com", "article_metadata": {"geo.region": "US-CA", "content_section": "undef", "description": "Life:  | addiction, hoag, solmar, treatment, insurance, patients, residential, programs, people, care", "geo.position": "33.745573;-117.867834", "author": "COURTNEY PERKES", "og": {"site_name": "The Orange County Register", "description": "Hoag Hospital has opened a 21-bed residential substance abuse treatment center in Newport Beach, the first in California to be located on an acute-care hospital campus.", "title": "Hoag opens on-site rehab facility in Newport Beach", "url": "http://www.ocregister.com/articles/addiction-679287-hoag-solmar.html", "image": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/gallery/ntnulh-b88480199z.120150825155854000grdbkk3t.10.jpg", "locale": "en-US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/gallery/ntnulh-b88480199z.120150825155854000grdbkk3t.10.jpg"}, "title": "Hoag opens on-site rehab facility in Newport Beach", "description": "Hoag Hospital has opened a 21-bed residential substance abuse treatment center in Newport Beach, the first in California to be located on an acute-care hospital campus.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@ocregister"}, "publication_date": "2015-08-25", "content_author": "COURTNEY PERKES", "fb": {"app_id": 107698536003308}, "content_thumbnail": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/thumb/ntnulh-b88480199z.120150825155854000grdbkk3t.10.jpg", "content_type": "article", "ICBM": "33.745573, -117.867834", "Keywords": "addiction, hoag, solmar, treatment, insurance, patients, residential, programs, people, care", "geo.placename": "Santa Ana", "access-type": "paid", "section": "undef", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "content_title": "Hoag opens on-site rehab facility in Newport Beach"}, "article_summary": "While a few California hospitals run residential treatment programs off-site, SolMar has the full backing of the nonprofit hospital\u2019s resources.\nHoag Hospital has opened a 21-bed residential substance abuse treatment center in Newport Beach, the first in California to be located on an acute-care hospital campus.\nClark said she\u2019s not sure if more hospitals will follow Hoag\u2019s lead and open residential programs.\nThe 10,000-square-foot building housing SolMar was remodeled with a beach theme, including seaside photos taken by local residents who attend Hoag\u2019s outpatient recovery programs.\nEy said he expects many SolMar patients will have multiple addictions."}
