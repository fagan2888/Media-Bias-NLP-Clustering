Shemitz Students from Shanley High School in Fargo, N.D., St. Mary's High School in Bismarck, N.D., and Bishop Ryan High School in Minot, N.D., carry the lead banner during the annual March for Life in Washington Jan. 22. Nearly 500 students from North Dakota Catholic schools participated in this year's event.\n\nWashington \u2018Pro-life warriors\u2019 join together for D.C. march By NATE MADDEN, Catholic News Service | Published February 5, 2015\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle+\n\nWASHINGTON (CNS)\u2014On a chilly and cloudy morning on the National Mall in Washington, crowds gathered Jan. 22 for the annual March for Life, this year marking the 42nd anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion virtually on demand.\n\nTens of thousands gathered first to hear a lineup of speakers, before marching from the Mall up Constitution Avenue to the U.S. Supreme Court building on Capitol Hill.\n\nEarly in the day, Pope Francis showed his support of the pro-life gathering by tweeting the theme: \u201cEvery Life is a Gift\u201d with the hashtag #marchforlife.\n\nBy late morning, the temperature had reached about 40 degrees, warmer than many a previous march, and a music group opened the rally with the songs \u201cTo Be Loved\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019re Not Alone.\u201d The music was upbeat with lively mandolin licks and the powerful voice of the lead singer.\n\nSeveral members of Congress were in attendance, including U.S. Rep. Tim Huelskamp, R-Kansas, who told Catholic News Service, \u201cI am here to make my colleagues listen.\u201d Huelskamp said life is a core issue in the public debate, and that Kansas was already at the forefront of human rights issues. \u201cThey were at the forefront of the slavery issue,\u201d he said, and are now at the forefront of the life issue.\n\nLevi Fox, a volunteer and a graduate of Liberty University, said, \u201cHalf of our generation is missing. Sixty million have been killed since Roe v. Wade, which is why I am dedicating my time to the March for Life.\u201d\n\nAfter the musical opening, Patrick Kelly, the chairman of the March for Life board, told the crowd they were attending \u201cthe largest and most important human rights rally in the world,\u201d and noted the march is becoming \u201cbigger and younger every year.\u201d\n\nArchbishop Joseph E. Kurtz of Louisville, Kentucky, the president of the U.S. bishops\u2019 conference, opened the rally with prayer alongside priests, bishops and patriarchs of the Greek Orthodox, Orthodox American, Antiochean Orthodox and Serbian Orthodox churches, in a show of what the archbishop called \u201ca sign of Christian unity.\u201d\n\nThe archbishop called the marchers to not only \u201cbe joyful witnesses to the gospel of life,\u201d but also to be \u201cloving and welcoming\u201d to those in dire circumstances.\u201d\n\nJeanne Monahan-Mancini, director of the March for Life, addressed the marchers, congratulating them for making a \u201cpilgrimage\u201d before focusing on this year\u2019s theme.\n\n\u201cEvery Life Is a Gift\u201d emphasized that every life is a gift, regardless of a person\u2019s difficulty or disability, and also was meant to emphasize that everyone has a call and a mission\u2014and a role to play creating a culture of life.\n\nA large congressional delegation in attendance emphasized the importance of the Health Care Conscience Rights Act before yielding the floor to a passionate and energetic address by Sen. Tim Scott, R-South Carolina, who said the defense of life was \u201cthe responsibility of every single person in America.\u201d The conscience bill would implement a broad religious exemption and conscience protections for private employers who oppose the federal contraceptive mandate that is part of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nRep. Chris Smith, R-New Jersey, who followed Scott, told the crowd, \u201cThere have never been more pro-life lawmakers in Congress than we have today.\u201d\n\nIn discussing the Knights of Columbus\u2019 ultrasound initiative, which has just donated its 500th ultrasound machine, Supreme Knight Carl Anderson said, \u201cWomen have a right to know the truth.\u201d\n\nIn what may have been the most inspiring address of the day, Julia Johnson, a senior at Shanley Catholic High School in Fargo, North Dakota, said it was up to the youth of America to \u201cend the scourge of abortion.\u201d\n\nAs a member of \u201cthe pro-life generation,\u201d she said she was proud to have come alongside \u201c400 pro-life warriors,\u201d referring to the school bringing its entire student body on the 1,300-mile journey to the march.\n\n\u201cOur generation has seen through the smokescreen of lies and secrets,\u201d she added.\n\nThe president of Students for Life, Kristan Hawkins, discussed the gift of her son\u2019s life despite a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis. Hawkins said, \u201cI have personally witnessed the push in our culture to create \u2018perfect\u2019 babies.\u201d she said.\n\nThe remarks echoed those of the other speakers and marchers in declaring that \u201cwe are the pro-life generation.\u201d\n\nAfter the rally, the crowd left the Mall for Constitution Avenue and marched up to the Supreme Court. At the front, carrying the March for Life banner, were students from three North Dakota Catholic high schools\u2014Shanley in Fargo, St. Mary\u2019s in Bismarck and Bishop Ryan in Minot.\n\nAmong the marchers was a delegation led by Archbishop Timothy P. Broglio of the U.S. Archdiocese for the Military Services. The group included Catholic cadets from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York.\n\n\u201cSo much of the violence that plagues our contemporary world stems from the failure to recognize that human dignity,\u201d the archbishop said in a statement. \u201cWe demonstrate today to reiterate clearly that each person has an inestimable value from the moment of conception to his or her natural death.\u201d\n\nAs the pro-lifers reached the Supreme Court, a small of group demonstrating in support of keeping abortion legal tried to stop them. The protesters held signs that read, \u201cAbortion on demand and without apology.\u201d At least eight were arrested by the U.S. Capitol Police for blocking the marchers\u2019 path.\n\nAmong events on the anniversary of Roe was an early morning prayer service held at Constitution Hall before the march and rally. It was organized by the National Pro-Life Religious Council, the National Pro-Life Center on Capitol Hill, Faith and Action, and Priests for Life.\n\nJust as Jesus prayed that all would be one, \u201cthe Lord wants us to come together \u2018as one,\u2019 committed in the same faith and love for the unborn,\u201d said Father Denis Wilde, associate director of Priests for Life.\n\nThe National Council of Catholic Women continued its decades-long tradition of participating in this year\u2019s March for Life and related events. \u201cOur voices must be heard throughout the country in defense of life, traditional marriage, religious liberty and many other issues that affect our ability to practice our Catholic faith,\u201d commented Rebecca Woodhull, NCCW president.\n\nIn an interview with CNS a day before the march, Scott, the South Carolina senator, had predicted it would be a \u201cfantastic experience,\u201d adding that his foundation in religious faith informs his position on life.\n\n\u201cI see the world through the prism of faith and the sanctity of life is a key component to our existence,\u201d he said, \u201cand to the extent that we can protect it at its inception, we find ourselves on the most solid footing to experience the fullness of life.\u201d\n\nScott has talked often about facing adversity in his own life, growing up in poverty, and how he would have made bad choices if a mentor had not intervened and put him on a path to success.\n\nEvery life is important and \u201cnot giving up on any of them I think is incredibly important,\u201d he told CNS. \u201cMany people would have given up on me in my early teens and frankly my mother and some strong mentors did not give up on me. I have been able to see the other side of life. I hope that we take that same position and approach to the unborn.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cSo many folks talk about the conditions in which you bring a child into this world, but the fact of the matter is that I am thankful that, while I had to struggle with some very difficult times, I\u2019ve lived long enough to see the other side and I want everyone to have that benefit.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "WASHINGTON (CNS)\u2014On a chilly and cloudy morning on the National Mall in Washington, crowds gathered Jan. 22 for the annual March for Life, this year marking the 42nd anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s Roe v.
