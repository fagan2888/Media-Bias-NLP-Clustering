Healthy Michigan aims to improve access to high-quality health care and encourage healthy behaviors among low-income Michiganders, while reducing uncompensated care and the number of uninsured residents of the state.\n\nRead story.\n\nMedicaid HMOs in Michigan increased profitability significantly the past two years under the Affordable Care Act, primarily because the state expanded Medicaid by more than 619,000 and gave additional funding to support the newly insured population, according to an exclusive analysis conducted for Crain's.\n\nProfits rose for the HMOs by 627 percent on their Medicaid business lines to $298 million, or a 3.9 percent margin, for 14 plans in 2015 from $41 million, or 0.9 percent margin, in 2013 \u2014 the year before Michigan expanded Medicaid under Obamacare, according to Allan Baumgarten, a Minneapolis-based health care consultant.\n\nBaumgarten in June will publish a full report on all HMO business lines, including commercial and Medicare, in the 2016 Michigan Health Market Review. The Medicaid data presented here is based on annual financial reports the HMOs submitted to the Michigan Department of Insurance and Financial Services.\n\n\"Medicaid expansion and the rates the state is paying under expansion has been a very profitable business for the health plans of the state,\" Baumgarten said.\n\n\"Overall profitability is way up. The underwriting margins are very strong\" as average premium per member per month revenue increased by 15 percent in 2015, the first full year under the Healthy Michigan Medicaid expansion, Baumgarten said.\n\nUnderwriting margin excludes investment income gains and reflects premium revenue, medical and administrative expenses. It specifically assesses how well the health plans managed medical care.\n\nRick Murdock, executive director of the Michigan Association of Health Plans, said the association advocates for the state to set premium rates that would generate at least 2 percent annual profit margins for the Medicaid HMO plans.\n\n\"Looking at our records the past 10 years in terms of margins for Medicaid plans as an industry, they have been around 1 percent,\" Murdock said. \"The highest was in 2008, at 3.7 percent, and the lowest was in 2013 at 0.7 percent. Last year was about 2.8 percent, which is where we advocate. We believe this provides a good, viable means for health plans\" to offer value to members and the state.\n\nMurdock's profit margins for 2015 are based on net income of $239 million, which takes into account investment income, taxes and required contributions to reserves. Crain's analysis showed underwriting income in 2015 of $298 million, which accounts only for underwriting income and medical expenses.\n\nRegardless of the difference in accounting, Murdock said neither the state nor the HMOs really knew what to expect with utilization of medical services from the new Medicaid population.\n\n\"We knew a little of the outpatient utilization because some of the (Healthy Michigan enrollees) were from the county health plans, but nothing on inpatient or pharmacy,\" Murdock said.\n\nWhile HMO and state Medicaid officials expected newly enrolled Medicaid patients would require more medical services during the first year than the traditional Medicaid population, the massive enrollment gains and enhanced revenue made up for slightly sicker enrollees, Baumgarten said.\n\nFrom 2013 to 2015, Medicaid premium revenue in Michigan increased by 32 percent to average $393 per member per month. But medical expenses, which were projected to rise for that population, grew only by 20 percent to $321 per member per month, a $72 spread during that three-year period that accounted for the profitability gains, the study for Crain's found.\n\n\"The state anticipated higher level of utilization, built it into the rates, and it didn't happen,\" said Baumgarten.\n\nBecause of that, Michigan Medicaid officials expect to collect about $26 million back from at least five Medicaid HMOs for overpayments.\n\nCrain's has learned that Troy-based Molina Healthcare of Michigan and Detroit-based Meridian Health Plan of Michigan have been informed they must pay back several million tied to \"risk corridor\" contract provisions. Molina must pay back $8.5 million and Meridian $3.6 million.\n\nMichigan Medicaid profitability\n\nMost Michigan Medicaid health plans increased underwriting income and margins in 2015 (figures in millions):\n\nUnderwriting Income 2015 Underwriting Income 2014 Underwriting Margin % 2015 Underwriting Margin % 2014 Aetna Better Health $9.8 $8.0 4.2% 4.3% Blue Cross Complete -$1.6 -$13.9 -0.4% -5.4% Fidelis Secure Care -$1.1 NA -21.4% NA HAP/Midwest Health Plan $43.5 $30.0 9.8% 8.2% Harbor Health Plan $8.5 $.7 23.9% 3.0% HealthPlus Partners -$11.4 -$11.7 -4.4% -4.0% McLaren Health Plan $29.4 $25.1 3.7% 4.2% Meridian Health Plan of MI $27.0 $14.3 1.3% 1.0% Molina Healthcare $81.9 $54.0 6.7% 6.0% Priority Health Choice $13.0 -$1.3 2.9% -0.4% Sparrow PHP (FamilyCare) -$2.0 -$.4 -2.3% -0.6% Total Health Care $6.7 $5.6 2.1% 2.1% UnitedHealthcare Community Plan $79.1 $47.9 6.5% 4.8% Upper Peninsula Health Plan $15.2 $4.8 7.1% 3.4% HMO TOTAL $298.0 $163.1 3.9% 2.8%\n\nNA: Not applicable\n\nSource: Michigan Health Market Review by Allan Baumgarten; state HMO filings\n\nHealthy Michigan part of safety net\n\nIn April 2014, Michigan became one of 31 states that began to enroll thousands of people with incomes at 133 percent or below the federal poverty level (about $15,000 for an individual) into Medicaid under provisions of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe state had estimated 450,000 new Medicaid enrollees would join Healthy Michigan the first year. But 619,000 have signed up, swelling the Medicaid rolls by 30 percent to 2.3 million. Total HMO enrollment is 3.3 million.\n\nMedicaid expansion and nearly 350,000 additional people purchasing private insurance on the federal health insurance exchange in Michigan have cut the state's uninsured rate from 11.5 percent in 2010 to about 8 percent this year.\n\nWhile population health improvements haven't yet been calculated from ACA Medicaid expansion, Michigan's hospitals, physicians, medical and health care companies also have benefited by receiving hundreds of millions in dollars in payments, boosting their revenue and strengthening their bottom lines, said Paul Hughes-Cromwick, co-director of Altarum Institute's Center for Sustainable Health Spending in Ann Arbor.\n\n\"Medicaid expansion is a big boon to the state's economy. You have 600,000-plus people covered, and the plans are doing extremely well,\" he said. \"You get all this new money into the state, and (expanding Medicaid) has a multiplier effect that is a win for the overall state economy.\"\n\nFor example, the 90 cents Michigan will receive from the federal government after 2020 for each dollar in Healthy Michigan Medicaid spending will translate into $1.35 to $1.80 or more in state economic activity, he said.\n\nAnother positive ripple effect to Michigan's Medicaid expansion has been the double-digit decline in costs to hospitals for uncompensated care, Hughes-Cromwick said. In 2014, for example, hospitals in the 31 Medicaid expansion states reduced uncompensated care costs by $7.4 billion, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nLike HMOs, hospital profit margins are increasing under Obamacare, Baumgarten said. Michigan's 83 hospitals averaged 8.2 percent total profit margin in 2014, up from about 3 percent in 2013, he said.\n\nUnless hospital mergers pick up to blunt managed-care contract negotiating clout, health insurers will continue to force down prices that eventually will help to moderate private health premiums, Hughes-Cromwick said.\n\nDeclining uncompensated care costs \"will take pressure off the rates private payers will pay,\" he said, adding that also eventually is expected to slow business health care costs.\n\nNationally, Hughes-Cromwick said, Medicaid HMOs in many states also are recording some of the highest profit margins that they have enjoyed in years because of Medicaid expansion.\n\nBaumgarten, who surveys Medicaid plans in nearly a dozen states, said Michigan is the first state to report full 2015 numbers. He said several states, including Minnesota, are showing similar trends as Michigan.\n\nLooking forward this year, Baumgarten said he believes Medicaid HMOs will continue to post strong profits even as Medicaid enrollment and rates flatten.\n\nHughes-Cromwick said he, for several reasons, expects Michigan to lower HMO Medicaid rates for 2017. He said the state will moderate rates as they take into consideration the relatively high profit margins HMOs have enjoyed the past two years and how utilization rates for some plans have flattened.\n\nHughes-Cromwick said Medicaid utilization in Michigan and other states started to decline during 2015.\n\n\"We started to see acceleration with Medicaid and on the exchanges in 2014, and last year we started to see a de-acceleration,\" said Hughes-Cromwick, who is conducting his own study on Medicaid expansion. \"Utilization is stabilizing already. The plans with good care management are doing very well.\"\n\nGov. Rick Snyder's fiscal 2017 budget, which he presented in February, calls for a 1.5 percent increase for traditional Medicaid and 2 percent for Healthy Michigan.\n\nHowever, the state's rate-setting process \u2014 that is based on actuarially sound payments to HMOs \u2014 could lead to lower or higher rate increases than previous years, depending on projected utilization and health care inflation trends.\n\nBaumgarten said many HMO executives he has spoken with believe Michigan will lower rates for 2017.\n\n\"The 3.9 percent profitability is maybe more than states want to pay,\" he said.\n\nMurdock acknowledged that part of the good fortune for Medicaid HMOs in 2015 was \"we got a good appropriation\" because the state knows the plans provide good value to members.\n\nBut he also said 2017 margins depend on rate levels, managing utilization of services and the big unknown \u2014 rising pharmaceutical costs.\n\n\"We are concerned about pharmaceuticals,\" he said. \"I would be surprised if we hit those margins next year.\"\n\nRelated Links", "article_metadata": {"description": "Medicaid HMOs in Michigan increased profitability significantly the past two years under the Affordable Care Act, primarily because the state expanded Medicaid by more than 619,000 and gave additional funding to support the newly insured population, according to an exclusive analysis conducted for\u00a0\u2026", "og": {"site_name": "Crain's Detroit Business", "description": "Medicaid HMOs in Michigan increased profitability significantly the past two years under the Affordable Care Act, primarily because the state expanded Medicaid by more than 619,000 and gave additional funding to support the newly insured population, according to an exclusive analysis conducted for\u00a0\u2026", "title": "Medicaid HMOs grow bottom lines after expansion in Michigan", "url": "http://www.crainsdetroit.com/article/20160417/NEWS/160419869/medicaid-hmos-grow-bottom-lines-after-expansion-in-michigan", "image": "http://www.crainsdetroit.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CD/20160417/NEWS/160419869/H4/0/H4-160419869.jpg&MaxW=1400&MaxH=1400", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@crainsdetroit", "card": "summary", "account_id": 29209404}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#b51218", "fb": {"app_id": 112806662066559}, "theme-color": "#b51218", "msapplication-TileImage": "/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"section": "NEWS", "tag": "Health care reform", "published_time": "2016-04-17T08:00:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-17T08:39:00-04:00", "author": "http://www.crainsdetroit.com/staff/JAYGRE"}, "verify-v1": "qPvWKmNahUcs8XBgUi+fy3A5YH6uzhhairJpQFCqXMs=", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui"}, "article_summary": "Because of that, Michigan Medicaid officials expect to collect about $26 million back from at least five Medicaid HMOs for overpayments.\nMedicaid HMOs grow bottom lines after expansion in MichiganWhat is Healthy Michigan?\nLooking forward this year, Baumgarten said he believes Medicaid HMOs will continue to post strong profits even as Medicaid enrollment and rates flatten.\n\"Medicaid expansion and the rates the state is paying under expansion has been a very profitable business for the health plans of the state,\" Baumgarten said.\nNationally, Hughes-Cromwick said, Medicaid HMOs in many states also are recording some of the highest profit margins that they have enjoyed in years because of Medicaid expansion."}
