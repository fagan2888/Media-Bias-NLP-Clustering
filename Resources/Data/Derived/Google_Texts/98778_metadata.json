Bam. Thank you, shareholder!\" Heron announced its intention to sell an undisclosed number of shares after the closing bell last night. Then, just over 16 hours later, Heron announced that it was pricing 4.5 million shares for sale at $11.75 per share, an 8% discount to yesterday's closing price. The deal is expected to raise $60 million in gross proceeds for Heron, which it intends to use for general corporate purposes, as well as funding current and future clinical research.\n\nNow what: This is certainly one of the quickest deal pricings I've ever witnessed, and the 8% discount points to the fact that not only did it catch investors off guard, but that demand for the shares wasn't expected to be robust. It's hard to get excited about Heron when its quarterly losses are often outpacing Wall Street's estimates and it has but one solitary compound in its entire pipeline, one which has been previously been turned away by the Food and Drug Administration. That implies a lot of risk inherent in Heron's stock and is more than enough for this investor to stick firmly to the sidelines.", "article_metadata": {"publish_time": "13:58", "description": "Heron prices a secondary offering before the opening bell and shareholders show their displeasure.", "ResponsiveALP": "1Ses_2things-v-single_single-control_50", "author": "Sean Williams", "promo": "Heron prices a secondary offering before the opening bell and shareholders show their displeasure.", "twitter": {"title": "Why Heron Therapeutics Inc.
