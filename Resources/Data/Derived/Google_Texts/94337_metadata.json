Republicans continue to control the United States House of Representatives with a 246-188 majority \u2014 there is one vacant seat \u2014 their largest majority since World War II.\n\nMany business owners had hoped that with these Republican majorities Congress would pass significant pro-business legislation that the President would have to sign. However, after eight months, the business community has seen little pro-business action from the Republican-led Senate and expanded House majority.\n\nHere are some of the reasons we have not seen progress on issues that are important to the business community and specifically to American Rental Association (ARA) members.\n\n60 votes. The first thing to remember when thinking about getting legislation to the President\u2019s desk is that it has to pass both the House and the Senate. The President is the only person who can sign a bill into law, but there are 100 senators who can potentially keep a bill from becoming law by stopping legislation before it gets to the Senate floor. Senate rules require a 60-vote margin on motions to proceed to debate on legislation, so if the majority party in the Senate wants to get anything done they either have to have at least a 60-vote majority or they must convince members of the minority to vote with them, so the Senate can proceed to debate on any legislation. As we have seen over the past decade or more, it isn\u2019t always easy to find those 60 votes. That is why we continue to see bills pass the House, where the majority rules with a pretty firm hand, and come to the Senate only to languish at the desk waiting for a vote.\n\nTwo-thirds vote of both houses. It also is important to add the notion that the President is the only person who can sign a bill into law, but the President also can veto legislation. If the President does veto a bill, the Constitution requires a two-thirds vote of both Houses to override the President\u2019s veto. If the President prevails, the legislation is not enacted. Given the need for 60 votes to move legislation in the Senate and the veto threat the President holds in his hand, it is easy to see why it is so difficult to make laws, but that is not enough to explain why several issues that seem to have bipartisan support in Congress and are fully supported by the business community have not reached the President\u2019s desk in 2015.\n\nTax issues. Many ARA members who invest less than $2 million annually utilize Section 179 to expense up to $500,000 in purchases of qualified equipment that is part of their rental fleet or used to operate their business in another way. Section 179 at these levels is one of several provisions of the tax code that expires on a date specified in the legislation enacting it. On Dec. 19, 2014, the President signed a bill into law that extended Section 179 at the $500,000/$2,000,000 limits as well as 50-percent bonus depreciation and other expiring provisions. All of those provisions expired on Dec. 31, 2014. Both of these tax provisions are important to ARA members and have been part of the code for well over a decade.\n\nThis year the House has been very clear on its intention to pass permanent extensions of both Section 179 and bonus depreciation. H.R. 636, sponsored by Rep. Pat Tiberi (R-Ohio) and Rep. Ron Kind (D-Wis.), both members of the House Ways and Means Committee, would make Section 179 permanent at the $500,000/$2,000,000 levels indexed for inflation. H.R. 636 passed the House on Feb. 13, 2015, and is awaiting action in the Senate. Tiberi also sponsored H.R. 2510 that would make the 50-percent bonus depreciation provision permanent. H.R. 2510 has not yet passed the House. Moreover, there are a number of other tax provisions which expired on Dec. 31, 2014, that are waiting for Congressional action.\n\nA crowded schedule. One question frequently asked is why things take so much time in Washington, D.C. The answer actually is pretty simple \u2014 there isn\u2019t enough time to act on all of the legislation introduced. When you add politics to that equation you end up with a process that moves slowly or not at all. There have been a few very large items on the Congressional agenda in 2015 that have caused the slow movement of legislation to the President\u2019s desk. One has been trade. The Administration and Congressional Republicans were anxious to get a set of trade bills passed that would give the President \u201cfast track\u201d authority to negotiate trade deals, which could be presented to Congress for an up or down vote without amendments. Another part of this package was a bill to provide money for retraining workers who are displaced because their jobs are lost as a direct result of trade. On the surface, a typical compromise between Republicans and Democrats, except that most Congressional Democrats were not going along with the deal. The result was several weeks of high drama as Congressional Republicans and the White House worked to make all of the stars align so that final passage was possible. The final package of trade bills passed the Congress on June 26 and was signed by the President on June 29.\n\nAnother big item on the Congressional schedule this year is funding the federal highway program. This seems to be an ongoing saga of knowing the problem, but not knowing how to pay for the solution. Once again, the Highway Trust Fund (HTF), which is the funding source for the federal contribution to highway and transit construction projects, is about to go broke. The current short-term patch was scheduled to provide funding only until July 31, 2015.\n\nRepublicans hoped that taking control of Congress would mean a return to a regular budget and appropriations process. Currently all 13 appropriations bills that fund the discretionary parts of the federal budget, including defense spending, are at various points in the process of moving through Congress. However, it appears that neither the budget nor the appropriations process is going to be smooth sailing this year, with several politically inspired confrontations likely to delay passage of final appropriations bills. This could require the development of an omnibus package with several appropriations bills put together into a larger legislative vehicle.\n\nFinally, there also has been a lot of inertia on health care legislation because of the recent King v. Burwell case before the Supreme Court. The case challenged the legality of federal subsidies paid to people buying health insurance in an exchange set up by the federal government instead of a state\u2013sponsored exchange. On June 25, 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court found for the government in a 6-3 decision reaffirming the Affordable Care Act (ACA) as the law of the land.\n\nWhat this means. While you may view what you have read with some level of pessimism, many in Washington, D.C., actually believe there is some reason to be optimistic about the direction we are moving over the next several months. First, the fact that the trade issue has been settled means that an issue which was taking up a lot of time and energy to the exclusion of many other priorities now is off the table and has given both Congressional Republicans and the White House some momentum going forward. Likewise, the conclusion of King v. Burwell removes a great deal of uncertainty about health care legislation and provides a clear opportunity for those who want to address some of the critical flaws of the ACA to move forward on that agenda.\n\nWith respect to the immediate issue of expiring tax provisions, including Section 179 and bonus depreciation, the need to do something to extend funding for the HTF also provides an opportunity. There have been proposals to write an extension through the end of 2015, but there are many members of Congress who do not want to revisit the issue so soon and especially at the beginning of a Presidential election year.\n\nThese members are suggesting a longer extension through the end of 2016. Because the HTF is a revenue measure, there is an opportunity to attach the package of expiring tax extenders that includes Section 179 and bonus depreciation. One or both provisions could be made permanent in this legislation, but even an extension through the end of 2016 would be preferable to an extension through the end of 2015. One of the biggest concern is that the package of expiring provisions will not get attached to the HTF extension and is left for the appropriations and budget process, which is likely to be very contentious and drag on until the end of 2015.\n\nARA members should be assured that your representatives in Washington, D.C., are working to resolve these tax issues at the earliest possible opportunity. The situation that occurred last year with a last-minute extension of these provisions, which then expired less than two weeks later, is unacceptable to businesses that must be able to plan their acquisitions and understand their tax liabilities. We will continue to follow these issues closely and keep you informed of any developments that could impact your business.\n\nJohn McClelland is vice president, government affairs, and chief economist for the American Rental Association (ARA).
