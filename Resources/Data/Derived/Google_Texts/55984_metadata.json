The ruling clears the way for Mrs Zia to stand trial. Prosecutors accuse her of having siphoned off cash from charitable trusts set up in memory of her late husband, Ziaur Rahman, who was an army leader at independence and was later assassinated as president. If found guilty, the country\u2019s second-most-powerful woman could face time in jail.\n\nThe court ruling reinforces the dominance enjoyed by the country\u2019s most powerful woman, Sheikh Hasina, the prime minister (pictured above). It comes eight months after she won an unprecedented second term in an election boycotted by Mrs Zia\u2019s Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP). Sheikh Hasina had put Mrs Zia under house arrest and barred the BNP\u2019s electoral ally, Jamaat-e-Islami, from running. With no opposition, it was a shoo-in for Sheikh Hasina\u2019s Awami League.\n\nAfter a nervous start and amid calls for fresh polls, her government has hit its stride. Some sympathisers argue that Sheikh Hasina\u2019s rule is justified, if only because of her success in developing the economy. Poverty has fallen rapidly since her return to power in 2009. The economy is now twice as big as when the kleptocratic and incompetent rule of Mrs Zia\u2019s government ended in 2006\u2014the moment the army locked up both battling begums.\n\nAfter its coup, the army discovered that governing was less enjoyable than it had imagined. It has since taken a back seat. It earns a handy $500m a year from its UN peacekeeping missions, the arms budget has grown nicely, and new additions to the army\u2019s business portfolio include yet another luxury hotel as well as a cattle ranch.\n\nAt the same time, Sheikh Hasina\u2019s government has continued to capture the courts, silence media critics and tinker with the constitution to perpetuate its rule. It has a two-thirds majority in Parliament, and its ally, the Jatiya Party of a former dictator, Mohammad Ershad, acts as the loyal opposition. On September 17th Parliament passed a constitutional amendment to give it the authority to fire judges.\n\nThe BNP has little choice but to wait until the next general election, which need not take place until 2019. Its claim that the Awami League is imploding is wishful thinking. Although the economy has recently slowed, the banking sector is in bad shape and law and order is shaky, no full-blown crisis is in sight.\n\nIn some respects, the government has been shrewd. It has kept pending long-overdue verdicts by a controversial tribunal set up to look at charges of genocide and other crimes committed during Bangladesh\u2019s war of independence from Pakistan. Almost all those charged are members of Jamaat-e-Islami. On September 17th the Supreme Court commuted a death sentence for Delwar Hossain Sayedee, a Jamaat leader. Mr Sayedee\u2019s sentencing for war crimes last year triggered a wave of fatal street unrest. This latest ruling, along with, in effect, a suspension of the war-crimes trials, hints that they have outlived their usefulness as a political tool.\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, the government is now considerably more popular than it was before the election, according to a recent opinion poll. The BNP says the poll is flawed; the party points out that it defeated the Awami League in mayoral elections last year (while accusing it of rigging local-government elections this year). Perhaps the opinion poll reflects a sense of fatalism: why flay the government when the opposition is not, for now, an alternative?\n\nHow the BNP climbs back into contention will remain unclear for some time. Out of parliament, its politicians rely on thugs for personal protection that was once provided by the state. Flanked by advisers who were once close to her husband, Mrs Zia insists that boycotting the general election was the right thing to do. She suggests that party reform is in the works and that her son, Tarique Rahman, in exile in London, will make a political comeback. Mrs Zia declares that she is not interested in revenge\u2014unlike \u201cthat lady\u201d.\n\nAlthough Mr Rahman\u2019s return would inject some younger blood into the party, his elevation would divide the BNP at home and isolate it abroad. In 2008 American diplomats judged in cables leaked by WikiLeaks that \u201cmuch of what is wrong in Bangladesh can be blamed on Tarique and his cronies\u201d. Mr Rahman\u2019s defenders say that the corruption of which he is widely accused was in fact carried out by those who abused their connections with him.\n\nNot relishing a return of the BNP\u2019s mother-son duo\u2014which, among other things, turned a blind eye to the Islamist fringe\u2014foreign governments are content to do business with Sheikh Hasina. India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, has nothing like the close ties with Sheikh Hasina that were forged by the Gandhi dynasts of the country\u2019s recently defeated Congress party. Still, he is keen for relations with Bangladesh to be solid, emphasising economic ties and a common front against Islamist militants. China has submitted an open-ended offer of aid so long as it gets a seaport. Japan has just pledged $6 billion in loans. Russia and Bangladesh are conducting a feasibility study for two nuclear power plants\u2014though doubts exist about whether they will ever be built. Foreigners have put in bids to launch a Bangladeshi satellite, to be named after the prime minister\u2019s father and the country\u2019s founding president, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.\n\nAll, in other words, is set fair for Sheikh Hasina, despite a deeply flawed election. Without an effective opposition, she is under little pressure. Only if the prime minister feels that winning a third straight term in 2019 looks unlikely might she call an early poll in the hope of prolonging her dynasty\u2019s rule. One begum is winning the endless battle\u2014for the time being.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/50_by_50/images/print-edition/20140920_ASP001_0.jpg", "sailthru.flytitle": "Politics in Bangladesh", "description": "As the opposition takes a break from politics, the government tightens its grip", "pubdate": 20140920, "og": {"site_name": "The Economist", "description": "As the opposition takes a break from politics, the government tightens its grip", "title": "One and only one", "url": "http://www.economist.com/news/asia/21618888-opposition-takes-break-politics-government-tightens-its-grip-one-and-only-one", "image": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20140920_ASP001_0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "sailthru.rubric": "As the opposition takes a break from politics, the government tightens its grip", "sailthru.date": "2014-09-20 00:00:00", "twitter": {"image": "https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20140920_ASP001_0.jpg", "site": "@TheEconomist", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.printdate": "2014-09-20 00:00:00", "revisit-after": "1 day", "sailthru.web_section": "Asia", "fb": {"pages": 6013004059, "app_id": 173277756049645}, "sailthru.imagepath": "images/print-edition/20140920_ASP001_0.jpg", "articleid": 21618888, "sailthru.image.thumb_mfte": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/ec_related_article_image/images/print-edition/20140920_ASP001_0.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "Politics in Bangladesh", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theeconomist"}, "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20140920_ASP001_0.jpg", "news_keywords": "Politics in Bangladesh"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc79a\"", "article_summary": "Sheikh Hasina had put Mrs Zia under house arrest and barred the BNP\u2019s electoral ally, Jamaat-e-Islami, from running.\nThe court ruling reinforces the dominance enjoyed by the country\u2019s most powerful woman, Sheikh Hasina, the prime minister (pictured above).\nThe ruling clears the way for Mrs Zia to stand trial.\nIt comes eight months after she won an unprecedented second term in an election boycotted by Mrs Zia\u2019s Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP).\nMrs Zia declares that she is not interested in revenge\u2014unlike \u201cthat lady\u201d."}
