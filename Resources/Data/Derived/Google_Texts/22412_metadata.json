Paul Ray, sees it differently.\n\nRay argues a team of trained marksmen is faster and more humane than the drawn-out deaths involved when lethal injections go awry \u2014 or even if they go as planned.\n\n\"Your body is paralyzed. You feel everything,\" Ray said. \"Your body slowly shuts down over a period of minutes based on the drug cocktail that's given to you. Whereas a firing squad, you reach the death obviously in three to five seconds.\"\n\nSome of the victims' family and friends wanted Gardner's life spared in 2010. But relatives of the slain bartender, Melvyn Otterstrom, and bailiff George \"Nick\" Kirk, pushed for the death sentence to stand.\n\n\"Gardner has hurt so many people. He has never shown any compassion for any of his victims, so why does he deserve compassion?\" Kirk's daughter, Tami Stewart, said tearfully at the time. \"The agony and toll he placed on my father deserves justice and that it be given.\"\n\nRepublican Gov. Gary Herbert has declined to say if he will sign the firing-squad bill. His decision is expected in a week or so.\n\nUtah and several other states are scrambling to modify their laws on the heels of a botched Oklahoma lethal injection last year and one in Arizona in which the condemned man took nearly two hours to die. Meanwhile, Texas executed a Mexican mafia hit man Wednesday night with its second-to-last dosage of drugs.\n\n\"States are wondering which way to go, and one way is to send up a warning flag that if you don't allow us freedom in this lethal-injection area, we'll do something else,\" said Richard Dieter, executive director of the Washington, D.C.-based Death Penalty Information Center, which opposes capital punishment.\n\nStates have struggled to keep up their drug inventories as European manufacturers opposed to capital punishment refuse to sell the components of lethal injections to U.S. prisons. The Texas deadline is the most imminent, but other states are struggling, too.\n\nThough Utah's next execution is probably a few years away, Ray said he wants to settle on a backup method now in case the drug shortage drags on.\n\nHe's hopeful the proposal will become law, saying he thinks the governor already would have announced his intention to veto it if that was his plan.\n\nUtah is the only state in the past 40 years to use the firing squad, with three such executions since the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976.\n\nLawmakers in the state stopped offering inmates the choice of firing squad in 2004, saying the method attracted intense media interest and took attention from victims.\n\nRonnie Lee Gardner was put to death by five police officers with .30-caliber Winchester rifles in an event that drew international attention.\n\nThree more death-row inmates who chose firing squad before the law changed would still have the option after their appeals are exhausted. If those executions go forward, prison authorities will choose the gunmen from a pool of volunteer officers, starting with those in the area where the crime happened, Ray said.\n\n\"We've always had a lot more volunteers than actually had spots,\" he said.\n\nUnder the new measure, the method would be based solely on the availability of lethal-injection drugs, not an inmate's choice.\n\nState laws that allow methods other than lethal injection for executions are not unique to Utah. In Washington, inmates can request a hanging. In New Hampshire, hangings are the default method if lethal injection cannot be given.\n\nOutside the U.S., 54 countries allow executions by gunshot, including China, Vietnam, Uganda and Afghanistan, according to Cornell University Law School's Death Penalty Worldwide project. Only nine countries are known to have done a firing squad execution in the past decade, the school's research has found.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Brian Skoloff contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Brother of man executed by Utah firing squad calls it brutal - AP News: SALT LAKE CITY (AP) \u2014 Randy Gardner still struggles four .05/26/2016 20:08:09PM EST.", "author": "AP News", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "SALT LAKE CITY (AP) \u2014 Randy Gardner still struggles four years later to talk about", "title": "AP News - Brother of man executed by Utah firing squad calls it brutal", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/politics-elections/2015/03/12/frustration-pushes-utah-toward-renewed-use-of-firing-squads-n1969486", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015\\70\\94561e44-4bb5-4b2f-a498-1483dc096137.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "SALT LAKE CITY (AP) \u2014 Randy Gardner still struggles four years later to talk about", "title": "AP News - Brother of man executed by Utah firing squad calls it brutal", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/politics-elections/2015/03/12/frustration-pushes-utah-toward-renewed-use-of-firing-squads-n1969486", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/70/94561e44-4bb5-4b2f-a498-1483dc096137.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Brother of man executed by Utah firing squad calls it brutal, AP News, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "Only nine countries are known to have done a firing squad execution in the past decade, the school's research has found.\nBut he said the firing squad is brutal.\nThree more death-row inmates who chose firing squad before the law changed would still have the option after their appeals are exhausted.\nWhereas a firing squad, you reach the death obviously in three to five seconds.\"\nLawmakers in the state stopped offering inmates the choice of firing squad in 2004, saying the method attracted intense media interest and took attention from victims."}
