John Kasich is expected to sign a bill defunding Planned Parenthood, making Ohio the ninth state to do so since undercover videos exposed the abortion provider\u2019s apparent role in harvesting the body parts of aborted babies.\n\nThe bill, H.B. 294, ensures that state and certain federal funds are not used to perform or promote nontherapeutic abortions at Planned Parenthood or elsewhere. The Ohio House passed the final version 62-32 on Wednesday and sent the legislation to the Republican governor\u2019s desk.\n\n\u201cGovernor Kasich has worked with legislative leaders to ensure that public dollars are used to their best purpose,\u201d Kasich spokesman Joe Andrews said, according to The Columbus Dispatch. \u201cThe Ohio Department of Health had already stopped awarding state dollars to Planned Parenthood.\u201d\n\nEight states\u2014Alabama, Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Texas, and Utah\u2014have defunded Planned Parenthood after the pro-life Center for Medical Progress released a series of hidden-camera videos that put the nation\u2019s largest abortion provider under the microscope for questionable and perhaps illegal practices.\n\nOther states, such as Indiana, have worked to defund Planned Parenthood.\n\nAfter passing legislation Thursday, Wisconsin also may soon deprive the organization of taxpayer dollars.\n\nThe new Ohio law will direct funds from the state Health Department budget to community health centers. It will not allow the Department of Health to contract or affiliate with entities that perform or promote nontherapeutic abortions, which don\u2019t involve the life of the mother or cases of rape or incest.\n\nThe legislation\u2019s sponsors were state Reps. Margaret Conditt, R-Liberty Township, and Bill Patmon, D-Cleveland.\n\n\u201cOhio legislators have wisely redirected existing funding from the scandal-plagued Planned Parenthood to thousands of better, low-cost community health care providers that serve women and families far more comprehensively,\u201d Casey Mattox, senior counsel for the legal group Alliance Defending Freedom, told The Daily Signal.\n\n\u201cOhio taxpayers should not be forced into an immoral partnership with Planned Parenthood.\u201d\n\nAfter the surfacing of the Center for Medical Progress\u2019 first undercover video in July 2015, Kasich spokesman Rob Nichols released this statement:\n\nThe governor is a strong, consistent and committed believer in the sanctity of human life and finds this news and practice abhorrent. This is illegal under both Ohio and federal laws and anyone who violates those laws should be prosecuted to the fullest extent possible, and credible evidence of a possible violation should be fully investigated.\n\nAccording to Ohio Right to Life, the new law will cut over $1 million in the state\u2019s use of yearly federal grants that had gone to Planned Parenthood.\n\n\u201cThanks to the thoughtful, careful work of the Ohio House and Senate, the taxpayer dollars of pro-life Ohioans like myself will now be shielded from the abortion industry,\u201d Stephanie Ranade Krider, executive director of Ohio Right to Life, said in a formal statement. She added:\n\nThis is an incredible victory for the pro-life cause in Ohio and for the national pro-life movement\u2019s collective efforts to defund the abortion industry chief, Planned Parenthood. This legislation will mark the extraordinary moment when Ohio decided to get out of the abortion business.\n\nThe Ohio House first passed the bill in November and sent it to the Ohio Senate. When the Senate in turn voted in late January to defund Planned Parenthood, Stephanie Kight, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Ohio, released a statement saying the Ohio General Assembly \u201cchose politics over people.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is not what Ohioans want,\u201d Kight said.\n\nSarah Torre, a policy analyst in the DeVos Center for Religion and Civil Society at The Heritage Foundation, wrote that Planned Parenthood affiliates receive over half a billion dollars each year from state and federal sources.\n\n\u201cCongress should end federal taxpayer funding to Planned Parenthood affiliates and redirect those funds to health centers that provide health care for women without entanglement in abortion or questionable handling of baby body parts,\u201d Torre wrote.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"This legislation will mark the extraordinary moment when Ohio decided to get out of the abortion business,\" pro-life activist Stephanie Ranade Krider says.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\"This legislation will mark the extraordinary moment when Ohio decided to get out of the abortion business,\" pro-life activist Stephanie Ranade Krider says.", "title": "Ohio Set to Become 9th State to Defund Planned Parenthood", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160211_OhioPP_Jessen.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-16T08:12:30+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1XmxeGm"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\"This legislation will mark the extraordinary moment when Ohio decided to get out of the abortion business,\" pro-life activist Stephanie Ranade Krider says.", "title": "Ohio Set to Become 9th State to Defund Planned Parenthood", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160211_OhioPP_Jessen.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "Protecting Life", "published_time": "2016-02-12T16:41:38+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-16T08:12:30+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Ohio, John Kasich, Planned Parenthood, defund, Center for Medical Progress, state funds, federal funds, abortion, health centers"}, "article_summary": "When the Senate in turn voted in late January to defund Planned Parenthood, Stephanie Kight, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Ohio, released a statement saying the Ohio General Assembly \u201cchose politics over people.\u201d\u201cThis is not what Ohioans want,\u201d Kight said.\n294, ensures that state and certain federal funds are not used to perform or promote nontherapeutic abortions at Planned Parenthood or elsewhere.\nOther states, such as Indiana, have worked to defund Planned Parenthood.\nThe new Ohio law will direct funds from the state Health Department budget to community health centers.\nShe added:This is an incredible victory for the pro-life cause in Ohio and for the national pro-life movement\u2019s collective efforts to defund the abortion industry chief, Planned Parenthood."}
