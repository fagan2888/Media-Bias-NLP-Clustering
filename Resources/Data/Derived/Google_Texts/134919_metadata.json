Some guys are good at it, some guys are not.\u201d\n\nOvernight leader Kevin Stadler only managed a 76 to share second place with Thongchai Jaidee, who carded a 72. Stadler still had a chance to win it on the last hole, but he missed a long birdie putt. He then failed to even force a playoff when he missed a three-footer for par.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s very hard to lose the same tournament twice on the same day and I managed to do it,\u201d Stadler said.\n\nMcDowell had seven top-10 finishes this year on the European Tour and PGA Tour before entering this tournament.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve pretty much thought of myself a decent bad weather golfer, until the last five years,\u201d McDowell said. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m spending a little bit too much time in America. I\u2019m a little bit soft, and I needed that type of a day.\u201d\n\nStadler went into the final round with a four-shot lead over Thongchai and Victor Riu. He even got a five-stroke cushion when Riu found water off the tee of the second hole for a double bogey.\n\nSoon, Stadler put himself in trouble by missing short par putts on No. 4 and No. 6. He then double-bogeyed No. 7 by hooking his tee shot into the rough before missing the fairway with his second shot.\n\nAnother errant tee shot from Stadler on No. 8 gave Riu a share of the lead.\n\n\u201cIt was absolutely miserable,\u201d Stadler said about the weather. \u201cWe don\u2019t play in that stuff in the States.\u201d\n\nFour players then shared the lead when McDowell and Jamie Donaldson made birdies on the 13th and 14th, respectively, to join Stadler and Riu atop the leaderboard.\n\nMcDowell sank a birdie putt from more than 20 feet on No. 16 to move three strokes clear. But Stadler made a strong charge to get back into contention, tying the defending champion with a birdie on that same hole.\n\nAfter finishing his round, McDowell was preparing for a playoff with Stadler, but a huge roar from the crowd told him the American had missed his par putt.\n\n\u201cLast night, I didn\u2019t think I had a shot,\u201d McDowell said. \u201cI had a glass of wine or two last night to kind of drown my frustration.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Graeme McDowell rallies from 8 back to win French Open", "title": "Graeme McDowell rallies from 8 back to win French Open", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/07/06/graeme-mcdowell-rallies-from-8-back-to-win-french-open/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140706__mcdowellp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140706__mcdowellp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-06T16:46:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T08:22:16+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "7 by hooking his tee shot into the rough before missing the fairway with his second shot.\n\u201cLast night, I didn\u2019t think I had a shot,\u201d McDowell said.\nSAINT-QUENTIN-EN-YVELINES, France \u2014 Graeme McDowell of Northern Ireland came from eight shots back to retain his French Open title Sunday, shooting a 4-under 67 in pouring rain to win by one shot.\n\u201cThat goes back to my upbringing a little bit in my teens, playing through all weathers and conditions,\u201d McDowell said.\nAnother errant tee shot from Stadler on No."}
