Facing unresolved issues on free trade, President Obama welcomed Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to the White House Tuesday for an official state visit, saying the two leaders are working to “broaden our alliance for our time.”

During a traditional welcoming ceremony on the South Lawn of the White House, Mr. Obama called Japan “one of America’s closest allies in the world.”

“The United States has renewed our leadership in the Asia-Pacific,” Mr. Obama said. “Prime Minister Abe is leading Japan to a new role on the world stage.”

Mr. Abe said U.S.-Japan relations are “back on track,” a goal which he called his top foreign-policy priority.

“Our bilateral relationship is more robust than ever,” Mr. Abe said.

Among the topics that the two leaders will discuss is the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership, a massive free trade agreement that is encountering heated opposition from congressional Democrats. Japanese and U.S. negotiators haven’t resolved questions over tariffs on beef and auto exports, and many U.S. lawmakers would like any deal to address currency manipulation as well.

The two nations also announced an expanded military cooperation agreement on Monday, which is expected to leader to greater U.S.-Japan coordination in the South China Sea, where China has exerted territorial claims on the Senkaku Islands.

Mr. Obama and first lady Michelle Obama will host a State Dinner Tuesday night for Mr. Abe and his wife, Akie.
