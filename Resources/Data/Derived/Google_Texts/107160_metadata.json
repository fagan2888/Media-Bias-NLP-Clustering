Today, it\u2019s estimated that one-third of the world\u2019s population uses some form of social media. Although social media has surely changed the course of history, could it have possibly changed the way our brains function? Studies say absolutely.\n\nSocial media has contributed to the rise of \u201cInternet addiction.\u201d While social media addiction is obviously different from drug or alcohol addiction, a 2012 study found that our brain treats the two quite similarly. This calls attention to treating Internet addiction as a new and serious mental health issue.\n\nBut addiction is not the only brain change believed to be brought about by social media\u2019s popularity; it\u2019s also re-routed our ability to multitask. Scientists at Stanford University found that individuals who spend a significant time online using social media were \u201cmore susceptible to interference from irrelevant environmental stimuli\u201d and less able to complete more than one task simultaneously.\n\nSocial media has not only affected the way our brains work, it\u2019s also interfered with our nervous systems. Phantom vibration syndrome is a relatively new but completely legitimate psychological process where individuals constantly believe their phones are vibrating. Researchers believe it\u2019s caused by chronic phone exposure causing our nerves to interpret the simplest itch as an incoming text message.\n\nASAP Science reports that social media has also increased the amount the average person spends speaking about themselves but, surprisingly, added that the virtual interaction actually leads to more successful relationships. Perhaps this is the doing of social media or perhaps it\u2019s because the only person who can tolerate an Internet addict is another Internet addict. Still, the evidence is strong. So, are we controling technology or does it control us?", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "5, ways, social, media, has, changed, way, our, brains, work", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The rise of social media has changed both the way society communicates and consumes news, but has it also managed to change the way our brains work?", "title": "5 Ways Social Media Has Changed The Way Our Brains Work [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/5-ways-social-media-has-changed-way-our-brains-work-302682", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/11/social-media.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The rise of social media has changed both the way society communicates and consumes news, but has it also managed to change the way our brains work?", "title": "5 Ways Social Media Has Changed The Way Our Brains Work [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/5-ways-social-media-has-changed-way-our-brains-work-302682", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/11/social-media.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/11/social-media.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Science/Tech", "published_time": "2014-09-11T16:02:05-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-11T16:02:04-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The rise of social media has changed both the way society communicates and consumes news, but has it also managed to change the way our brains work?"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd1ae\"", "article_summary": "Although social media has surely changed the course of history, could it have possibly changed the way our brains function?\nSocial media has contributed to the rise of \u201cInternet addiction.\u201d While social media addiction is obviously different from drug or alcohol addiction, a 2012 study found that our brain treats the two quite similarly.\nSocial media has not only affected the way our brains work, it\u2019s also interfered with our nervous systems.\nToday, it\u2019s estimated that one-third of the world\u2019s population uses some form of social media.\nBelieve it or not, the very first social media site was created in 1997; however, it wasn\u2019t until the early 2000s that the phenomena truly set off."}
