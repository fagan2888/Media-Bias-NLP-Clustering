Fifty-four percent said they changed due to unsatisfactory technology infrastructures and 53 percent said they changed because custodians charged too much.\n\nNot surprisingly, the larger the RIA, the greater their control of asset market share. RIAs with $500 million or more in assets control 69.2 percent of the RIA channel\u2019s market share, the researchers found.\n\nNearly two-thirds \u2014 65 percent \u2014 of dually registered advisors plan to continue serving clients on a fee and commission basis, the report said. Dually-registered RIAs firms are registered as an advisor and as a broker-dealer.\n\nRegistering as an investment advisor entails meeting a fiduciary standard of care toward clients whereas a registering as a broker-dealer entails meeting a suitability standard.\n\nAnd last but not least, why are advisors leaving broker-dealers and wirehouses for the RIA channel in the first place?\n\nFifty-five percent of advisors who switched to the RIA channel said they were driven to do so out of independence and because they were dissatisfied with the culture at broker-dealers, the report said.\n\nInsuranceNewsNet Senior Writer Cyril Tuohy has covered the financial services industry for more than 15 years.
