[Photo Courtesy: Aaron Gililland.]\n\nThursday morning, the Oklahoma City Zoo announced the sudden death of beloved 4-year-old, female Asian Elephant Malee.\n\nMalee died in the early morning hours on Thursday, Zoo officials said. Zoo keepers noticed slower than normal movements on Wednesday, which continued into the afternoon. However, they said Malee was eating and otherwise normal.\n\nAround 4:30 p.m., officials said concern grew as zoo keepers noticed discoloration in her mouth. At that time, they initiated protocol treatment for EEHV (elephant endotheliotropic herpes virus,) although it is not confirmed as the cause of death.\n\nFollowing a prescribed protocol, officials said a second treatment was given around 1 a.m. Thursday. But Malee\u2019s condition had not changed at that time. Despite the aggressive treatment, officials said Malee declined rapidly and passed away at approximately 4 a.m.\n\nA necropsy (animal autopsy) will be performed to determine exact cause of death, according to Zoo officials. But results may not be known for some time.\n\nZoo officials said all the other elephants are doing well at this time.\n\nMalee was the first elephant born at the Oklahoma City Zoo in 2011.\n\n3/16/2011 Related Story: Asha The Elephant Gives Birth At OKC Zoo", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Thursday morning, the Oklahoma City Zoo announced the sudden death of beloved 4-year-old, female Asian Elephant Malee.", "author": "Xin Xin Liu", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/30163075/okc-zoo-saddened-by-sudden-death-of-beloved-elephant-malee", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/8921262_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Thursday morning, the Oklahoma City Zoo announced the sudden death of beloved 4-year-old, female Asian Elephant Malee.", "title": "OKC Zoo Saddened By Sudden Death Of Beloved Elephant Malee"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/8921262_G.jpg", "description": "Thursday morning, the Oklahoma City Zoo announced the sudden death of beloved 4-year-old, female Asian Elephant Malee.", "card": "summary", "title": "OKC Zoo Saddened By Sudden Death Of Beloved Elephant Malee"}, "wnreadableurl": "okc-zoo-saddened-by-sudden-death-of-beloved-elephant-malee", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KWTV", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "date": "2015/10/01", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs, malee, zoo, elephant, death, news 9, kwtv, news9.com", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS08", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs, malee, zoo, elephant, death, news 9, kwtv, news9.com"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde905\"", "article_summary": "Thursday morning, the Oklahoma City Zoo announced the sudden death of beloved 4-year-old, female Asian Elephant Malee.\nMalee was the first elephant born at the Oklahoma City Zoo in 2011.\nZoo officials said all the other elephants are doing well at this time.\nAt that time, they initiated protocol treatment for EEHV (elephant endotheliotropic herpes virus,) although it is not confirmed as the cause of death.\nDespite the aggressive treatment, officials said Malee declined rapidly and passed away at approximately 4 a.m.A necropsy (animal autopsy) will be performed to determine exact cause of death, according to Zoo officials."}
