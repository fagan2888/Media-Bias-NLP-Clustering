(Jon Elswick/Associated Press)\n\nGreat catch by Greg Sargent today, who notes that Republican voters are all for \u201cthe part in the 2010 health care law that provides financial help to low- and moderate-income Americans who don\u2019t get health insurance through their jobs to help them purchase coverage\u201d but are strongly against the idea that \u201cproviding health coverage for the poor is the responsibility of the federal government.\u201d\n\nNow, the trick to interpreting this correctly isn\u2019t (as liberals would) to decide that Republicans really like big government or (as conservatives would) to decide that Republicans really oppose social spending. Instead, what\u2019s probably going on here is both \u2014 and neither.\n\nThat is, most voters respond to the liberal and conservative frames on most issues. Not all issues \u2014 most of us have a few things we care strongly about, whether it\u2019s guns, abortion, minimum wage, Afghanistan or whatever. Very few of us have a strong belief in a particular \u201cideology\u201d in the sense of strongly adhering to a particular set of first principles that attentive political actors would recognize as \u201cliberal\u201d or \u201cconservative\u201d (or socialist, libertarian, green or whatever). Instead, most voters seem to appreciate arguments from multiple sides \u2014 we might think it sounds right that people should make it on their own and that too much government assistance would make us dependent, but we might also think it sounds right that we should pitch in collectively to help the needy and also that there are things we can do collectively to ensure a fairer chance for all.\n\nIn practical terms, believing both of those things might be wildly inconsistent, but it\u2019s also true, in practical terms, that most of us never have to resolve that inconsistency \u2014 so we don\u2019t. Not because we\u2019re stupid or even because we\u2019re ill-informed (although it\u2019s the most informed who tend to be the most ideological), but because there\u2019s no reason to.\n\nAs Greg suggests, however, the closer questions get to triggering partisanship, the more we\u2019ll give the \u201ccorrect\u201d ideological answers \u2014 that is, ask a Republican about Obamacare, and she\u2019ll know that she hates it (and Democrats will know that they like it). There\u2019s an incentive-based answer to why that happens, too. Picking an ideology, for most of us, doesn\u2019t accomplish anything. Picking a party, however, massively simplifies voting, which is something most of us do, fairly often and most of the time with very little to go on. Not only that, but party is actually a great shortcut \u2014 as long as we pick the one that generally lines up with us on the few issues we really do care about, then party \u201cworks\u201d to identify the candidate most likely to hold that position.\n\nSo, again in practical terms, what Republicans will act on in terms of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is that they\u2019ll vote for candidates who oppose Obamacare. But, yes, for most of them it\u2019s not because it violates some deeply held principles; it\u2019s because they\u2019re Republicans. Just as most Democrats will vote for candidates who support the ACA because, well, they\u2019re Democrats. And the best thing? That turns out to make for a very effective democracy.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In a surprising way, strong party affiliation helps ensure a stronger democracy.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "In a surprising way, strong party affiliation helps ensure a stronger democracy.", "title": "Ideology and party", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2013/12/20/ideology-and-party/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2013/12/20/Production/WashingtonPost/Images/Health_Overhaul_Disparities-08b91.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2013/12/20/ideology-and-party/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "health care reform, affordable care act, party identification, ideology,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "health care reform, affordable care act, party identification, ideology,"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe33fd\"", "article_summary": "In practical terms, believing both of those things might be wildly inconsistent, but it\u2019s also true, in practical terms, that most of us never have to resolve that inconsistency \u2014 so we don\u2019t.\nNot all issues \u2014 most of us have a few things we care strongly about, whether it\u2019s guns, abortion, minimum wage, Afghanistan or whatever.\nSo, again in practical terms, what Republicans will act on in terms of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is that they\u2019ll vote for candidates who oppose Obamacare.\nBut, yes, for most of them it\u2019s not because it violates some deeply held principles; it\u2019s because they\u2019re Republicans.\nThat is, most voters respond to the liberal and conservative frames on most issues."}
