Learn from your IT team. Companies looking to become more agile in the digital age need to spend time with their information technology teams,McKinsey & Co.\u2019s Paul Willmott suggests. Agile, in one form or another, has been part of IT for at least a decade, its adoption accelerating alongside the rise of nimble Silicon Valley startups which place a premium on iterative software development. So does this mean the CEOs will soon demand leadership \u201cscrums?\u201d Sort of, suggests Mr. Willmott. \u201c[Agile] can be applied more broadly across a business, with small teams meeting frequently and people from relevant functions actively working together with greater authority to make decisions quickly (no more monthly steering committees).\u201d Just how IT embraces modularity and for efficiency, businesses should embrace reusable business processes. Next up: boardroom stand-up meetings.\n\nHow a bunch of government space geeks at NASA won the Internet. Everyone\u2019s favorite Kuiper belt dwarf planet peppered social media feeds this week, a reflection both of NASA\u2019s scientific achievement and its social media prowess. Quartz\u2019s Adam Epstein writes that there are lessons to be learned for Earth based-organizations \u201ctrying to understand how to break down the barriers between itself and its public.\u201d Astronauts tweet and Instagram and Vine, of course. But the agency\u2019s most powerful social tool is an \u201cirresistible online identity\u201d: many rovers and probes speak in the first person on social media. Here\u2019s the last tweet from Messenger, which ended an 11-year mission by crashing into Mercury: \u201cWell I guess it is time to say goodbye to all my friends, family, support team. I will be making my final impact very soon.\u201d The personal voice, Mr. Epstein writes, \u201cmakes people want to care.\u201d Of course it helps to have awesome content. Sharing an image of Pluto trumps anyone\u2019s Instagram of a plate of bacon.\n\nA PC and a dream. The Microsoft cover story in Delta Sky magazine is an odd sort of beast, and not just because Microsoft Corp. CEO Satya Nadella is dropping terms like \u201cwe live in is a mobile-first, cloud-first world,\u201d in an inflight magazine. \u201cMicrosoft is a misunderstood company,\u201d the company\u2019s manager of storytelling tells reporter Steve Marsh and what follows is an argument for just how cool the company has become. Old offices have been remodeled \u201cinto open work areas with spaces that look like they belong in a cool ad agency,\u201d for example. Mr. Nadella wonders aloud what it would be like if T.S. Eliot wrote code. Let\u2019s see: \u201cThe month before launch is the cruellest month\u2026\u201d As any middle schooler will tell you, trying too hard to be cool is not cool, but Microsoft is on a mission to disassociate itself somewhat from its PC-focused past. \u201cThe thing that I value and look for in other leaders really circles around the notion of: Are they creating clarity and energy and are they a learner?,\u201d Mr. Nadella says. \u201cIf you\u2019re not curious, open to learning, raising your own game, admitting your own mistakes, then I think you stop doing useful things at some point.\u201d Now that\u2019s cool.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "What the C-suite can learn from the IT team; NASA's strikes social coup with Pluto coverage; Microsoft is misunderstood, here's what you need to know.", "title": "What Your CEO Is Reading: C-Suite Gets Agile; NASA\u2019s Social Strategy; Misunderstood Microsoft", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/cio/2015/07/17/what-your-ceo-is-reading-c-suite-gets-agile-nasas-social-strategy-misunderstood-microsoft/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-JK242_0715PL_P_20150715154710.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "CSuite", "article.headline": "What Your CEO Is Reading: C-Suite Gets Agile; NASA\u2019s Social Strategy; Misunderstood Microsoft", "description": "What the C-suite can learn from the IT team; NASA's strikes social coup with Pluto coverage; Microsoft is misunderstood, here's what you need to know.", "article_section": "CSuite", "author": "Tom Loftus", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "CIO Journal.
