Registration is 39 percent Republican, 40 percent Democratic and 43 percent Independent. But the district voted for Mitt Romney in the last presidential election and the figures on voting patterns for the district compiled by the Independent Redistricting Commission concluded the district is one of the few toss-up districts in the state, with Democrats enjoying only a slight edge. That explains why Gosar moved from Flagstaff to Prescott after the redistricting, to run in a safe Republican district. He had defeated Kirkpatrick in the old district boundaries in the election that enabled Republicans to seize control of the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nIn November, Republicans hope to build their majority in the House and perhaps take control of the U.S. Senate.\n\nTobin started out as a heavy favorite in the Republican primary, with name recognition as speaker of the house and a broad fundraising network. He faced a surprisingly tenacious challenge from Springerville businessman and rancher Gary Kiehne and state Rep. Adam Kwasman. Kiehne conceded the race late last week, with most of the uncounted ballots in Coconino County \u2014 which proved a stronghold for Tobin.\n\nThe campaign at times turned into something of a gaff-fest, drawing national headlines and bits on comedy shows. Kwasman got attention for his statement that Democrats account for 99 percent of mass shootings, for which he later apologized. Tobin gained attention when he suggested that unaccompanied minors in the country illegally could bring the ebola virus into the U.S.\n\nBut Kiehne gained ground steadily in the primary against the better known Tobin with an injection of about $600,000 of his own money. Tobin spent about $520,000, but came on strong at the end thanks to independent expenditures totaling $300,000 from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, $40,000 from Main Street Advocacy and $25,000 from Preserve America\u2019s Future.\n\nThe National Republican Party wasted no time funding a barrage of ads attacking Kirkpatrick for her \u201cbaggage\u201d including her vote to pass the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, meanwhile, announced plans to finance attack ads attacking Tobin for his role as speaker in supporting cuts in the state\u2019s school spending that totaled some $1 billion during the recession.\n\nTobin was elected speaker in 2011. He has served in the House since 2006 and as majority leader from 2010 to 2011. He led the House through the bleak days of the recession, when state revenues dropped by nearly a third. He also championed a number of controversial measures, including SB 1070 \u2014 which gained national headlines when it cracked down on illegal immigration by giving local police more responsibility for enforcing federal immigration laws and broad authority to stop people they suspected were in the country illegal. Most of the law was later declared unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nThe Paulden banker and businessman is a Roman Catholic with five children.\n\nIn the House, he amassed a staunchly conservative voting record.\n\nHe has nearly perfect voting scores from the National Rifle Association, Americans for Prosperity, Arizona National Federation of Independent Businesses, Arizona Small Business Association, The Goldwater Institute\u2019s rating on taxes and budget, the Center for Arizona Policy, and anti-abortion groups. He has already won the endorsement of the Arizona Police Association, Arizona Right to Life, Business-Industry Political Action Committee and Republican Main Street Partnership.\n\nRepublicans quickly closed ranks behind Tobin for the crucial struggle ahead, realizing Kirkpatrick\u2019s seat remains one of the best chances for the party to increase its majority in the House. Kirkpatrick won the seat with just 49 percent of the vote two years ago, with 6 percent of the vote going to the Libertarian in the race.\n\nHowever, Kirkpatrick has been preparing for the election for the past two years, developing a fundraising network and cultivating one of the most conservative voting records among House Democrats.\n\nShe\u2019s a former state lawmaker and Coconino County prosecutor. Born in McNary, she graduated from the University of Arizona and lives in Flagstaff. She\u2019s also a Roman Catholic, with two children. She served in the state Legislature from 2005-07 and in Congress from 2009-11, until her defeat by Gosar. She narrowly regained the redistricted seat in 2012.\n\nShe accumulated strong ratings for groups like Arizona\u2019s Right to Choose, Women\u2019s Political Caucus, Emily\u2019s List, the League of Conservation Voters, the Sierra Club and other women\u2019s rights, civil rights and environmental organizations.\n\nOn the other hand, she also got high marks from business groups and gun rights groups, according to the ratings posted on the Votesmart website.\n\nShe has faced attacks for supporting key policies of the Obama administration, including the Affordable Care Act. But she has also sharply criticized the administration on things like immigration polices and gun control efforts.\n\nShe has joined in several bipartisan efforts, notably joining with Gosar to push for a land exchange in Pinal County that would allow the development of a massive copper mine near Superior. She has also joined with Gosar to sponsor forest health bills as well as a bill to help Payson build the Blue Ridge pipeline by clarifying which federal agency has authority over the construction.\n\nGovTrack.us tracks votes for every member of Congress and compiles a graphic showing the \u201cideology score\u201d for each representative. The bills tracked focus on the most divisive issues, to draw as sharp a distinction as possible. The chart (https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/ann_kirkpatrick/412286) shows no Republicans on the Democratic side of the dividing line and about nine Democrats who fall on the Republican side of the line. Kirkpatrick falls just barely on the Democratic side of the line.\n\nThe website says Kirkpatrick missed 147 of 2,775 roll call votes \u2014 an absentee rate of 5.3 percent \u2014 roughly double the average.", "article_metadata": {"description": "One of the most closely watched congressional races will play out in Gila County with the high-stakes struggle between incumbent congresswoman Anne Kirkpatrick (D-Flagstaff) and the just-barely-victorious House Speaker Andy Tobin.", "og": {"site_name": "Payson Roundup", "description": "One of the most closely watched congressional races will play out in Gila County with the high-stakes struggle between incumbent congresswoman Anne Kirkpatrick (D-Flagstaff) and the just-barely-victorious House Speaker Andy Tobin.", "title": "Bitter congressional race in District 1", "url": "http://www.paysonroundup.com/news/2014/sep/11/bitter-congressional-race-district-1/", "image": "http://payson.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/img/croppedphotos/2014/09/09/tobin-kirkpatrick_crop_t640.jpg?a6ea3ebd4438a44b86d2e9c39ecf7613005fe067", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "One of the most closely watched congressional races will play out in Gila County with the high-stakes struggle between incumbent congresswoman Anne Kirkpatrick (D-Flagstaff) and the just-barely-victorious House Speaker Andy Tobin.", "creator": "@PaysonRoundup", "image": "http://payson.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/img/croppedphotos/2014/09/09/tobin-kirkpatrick_crop_t640.jpg?a6ea3ebd4438a44b86d2e9c39ecf7613005fe067", "title": "Bitter congressional race in District 1", "site": "@PaysonRoundup", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 68835}}, "google-site-verification": "uC_w1IUpsKL3TsMjd_zDvlKIm2W3_G2AwCkNI86NRiY", "viewport": "width=1020"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf6de\"", "article_summary": "That explains why Gosar moved from Flagstaff to Prescott after the redistricting, to run in a safe Republican district.\nGosar, a former dentist who has championed investigations of the state department, the Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. Attorney General\u2019s Office, is a staunch conservative in a safe Republican district.\nNorthern Gila County remains in Congressional District 4, where incumbent Paul Gosar (R-Prescott) faced no Republican opposition in the primary and the token opposition of activist Mike Weisser in the general election.\nHe had defeated Kirkpatrick in the old district boundaries in the election that enabled Republicans to seize control of the U.S. House of Representatives.\nKiehne conceded the race late last week, with most of the uncounted ballots in Coconino County \u2014 which proved a stronghold for Tobin."}
