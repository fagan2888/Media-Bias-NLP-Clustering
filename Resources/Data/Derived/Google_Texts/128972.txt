Last year, a landmark education case took aim at laws protecting bad teachers—and the students won. Vergara v. California reaffirmed the fundamental right of every student to learn from effective teachers and have an equal opportunity to succeed in school, paving the way for teacher accountability and greater choice. In his ruling on the case, The Honorable Judge Rolf M. Treu noted that “All sides to this litigation agree that competent teachers are a critical, if not the most important, component of success of a child’s in-school education experience. All sides also agree that grossly ineffective teachers substantially undermine the ability of that child to succeed in school.”

You are cordially invited to join Reason Foundation for a celebration of the Vergara decision, featuring a panel discussion with Vergara plaintiff Julia Macias and her family as well as others involved in the legal proceedings. We'll also be the first to screen Reason TV's new video on this historic case.
