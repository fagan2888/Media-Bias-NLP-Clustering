Family attorney John Tiemessen said he could confirm only that the Instagram account was Bristol Palin\u2019s.\n\nPalin announced her second pregnancy on her blog in June. She has not publicly identified the father of that child, but announced she was pregnant shortly after her engagement to Medal of Honor recipient Dakota Meyer was broken off last spring.\n\n\u201cI know this has been, and will be, a huge disappointment to my family, to my close friends, and to many of you,\u201d she wrote on her blog at the time she announced her second pregnancy. She asked for privacy for her and her son, Tripp.\n\n\u201cI do not want any lectures, and I do not want any sympathy,\u201d she wrote.\n\nOn Thursday, Meyer tweeted: \u201cBest Christmas present ever!! I couldn\u2019t be more proud of this little blessing.\u201d He also posted a photo of a sleeping infant held by someone wearing a hospital gown with the same pattern as the one shown on Bristol Palin\u2019s Instagram post.\n\nBristol Palin was 18 when her mother, then governor of Alaska, was selected by U.S. Sen. John McCain to be his running mate. Shortly after the selection, it was announced that the teenager was pregnant with her first child.\n\nAt the time, Sarah Palin said her daughter and the baby\u2019s father would marry. Bristol Palin and the baby\u2019s father, Levi Johnston, eventually ended the relationship.\n\nBristol Palin later became a paid spokeswoman advocating abstinence and warning against teenage pregnancies. She also performed on \u201cDancing with the Stars\u201d and had a short-lived cable TV show called \u201cLife\u2019s a Tripp.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bristol Palin is a mother for the second time.", "Author": "Rachel D'Oro", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Bristol Palin is a mother for the second time.", "title": "Bristol Palin announces birth of second child \u2014 daughter Sailor Grace", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/dec/25/bristol-palin-announces-birth-of-second-child/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/12/24/people-bristol_palin.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/12/24/people-bristol_palin.jpeg", "title": "Bristol Palin announces birth of second child \u2014 daughter Sailor", "description": "Bristol Palin is a mother for the second time.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Human Interest, Sarah Palin, Instagram"}, "article_summary": "Palin, who launched an abstinence campaign after giving birth as an unwed teenage mother, posted on Instagram Thursday that she gave birth to a girl, Sailor Grace, on Wednesday.\nANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) \u2014 Bristol Palin is a mother for the second time.\nBristol Palin later became a paid spokeswoman advocating abstinence and warning against teenage pregnancies.\nBristol Palin was 18 when her mother, then governor of Alaska, was selected by U.S. Sen.
