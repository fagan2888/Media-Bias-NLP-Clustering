Hanksy calls his piece \u201cEazy-E Bola.\u201d\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nAccording to ANIMAL New York, the art was pasted on the corner of Division and Canal Streets in Chinatown.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, Ebola is like hella serious omg,\u201d the artist told ANIMAL. \u201cBut American media just loves to sensationalize things.

Then again, I was in Texas last week and came down with a pretty nasty cough. Maybe I should get myself checked out.\u201d\n\nThe ANIMAL piece correctly points out that the artist\u2019s caption doesn\u2019t really make sense, because the Congo isn\u2019t located in West Africa, the region that Ebola originated in.\n\nStill, as Complex notes, that hasn\u2019t deterred commenters on Hanksy\u2019s Instagram page from adding their own disease/artist mashup ideas, including \u201cCancer Mix-a-lot\u201d and \u201cKanye West Nile Virus.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Street Artist 'Hanksy' Mashes Up Ebola and Rapper Eazy-E", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Street Artist 'Hanksy' Mashes Up Ebola and Rapper Eazy-E", "title": "Street Artist 'Hanksy' Mashes Up Ebola and Rapper Eazy-E - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Hollywood/2014/10/23/hanksy-ebola.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2014/10/23/street-artist-hanksy-mashes-up-ebola-and-eazy-e-for-street-art/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Street Artist 'Hanksy' Mashes Up Ebola and Rapper Eazy-E", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Hollywood/2014/10/23/hanksy-ebola.jpg", "title": "Street Artist 'Hanksy' Mashes Up Ebola and Rapper Eazy-E - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": ",Big Hollywood,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Hollywood", "published_time": "2014-10-23T06:55:00-07:00", "categories": "Big Hollywood"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda69e\"", "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERNew York City-based street artist Hanksy poked fun at Ebola and rapper Eazy-E with a new street art mashup that he posted to his Instagram page on Tuesday.\nHanksy calls his piece \u201cEazy-E Bola.\u201dSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERAccording to ANIMAL New York, the art was pasted on the corner of Division and Canal Streets in Chinatown.\n\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, Ebola is like hella serious omg,\u201d the artist told ANIMAL.\nStill, as Complex notes, that hasn\u2019t deterred commenters on Hanksy\u2019s Instagram page from adding their own disease/artist mashup ideas, including \u201cCancer Mix-a-lot\u201d and \u201cKanye West Nile Virus.\u201d\nMaybe I should get myself checked out.\u201dThe ANIMAL piece correctly points out that the artist\u2019s caption doesn\u2019t really make sense, because the Congo isn\u2019t located in West Africa, the region that Ebola originated in."}
