In order to take advantage of the increased federal funding and to keep costs down, some states have expanded eligibility for their managed care programs, presenting an appealing opportunity for health plans as many moved into the Medicaid managed care business.\n\nFinancial Services - State courts: the new M&A battleground Merger and acquisition activity has increased significantly over the last few years, resulting in a growth of a new \u201ccottage industry,\u201d whose practitioners file class action lawsuits that serve to delay every deal involving a public company. As a result, this has become a commonplace issue that bankers and lawyers who arrange the deals have to expect.\n\nEnergy - New Generation: Who decides what, where and when to build? In the past, the division of authority between state and federal regulators in the electric utility industry was clear. The states would authorize the construction of power plants within their borders and regulated retail rates, while the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission regulated wholesale rates.\n\nE-discovery \u2013 TAR enters the mainstream Technology Assisted Review (TAR), also known as \u201cpredictive coding,\u201d uses computer analytics to identify the patterns of words and phrases in documents to analyze the content, which provides a richer assessment of documents than more traditional e-discovery methods. For lawyers, this means having the ability to sharpen its focus on documents to specific topics.\n\nInsurance/Reinsurance \u2013 Burgeoning concussion lawsuits and changing principles With the highly-publicized lawsuits involving former NFL players and traumatic brain injury, concussion lawsuits have taken center stage. In August, the NFL announced a $765 million settlement, which if approved, would resolve the claims of thousands of retired players. But these suits have also raised a number of insurance coverage issues, leading the NFL and its insurers to file competing coverage actions.\n\nAdvertising \u2013 False Advertising: Injunction rules get tougher, and the stakes get higher More class action firms are shifting their focus from products liability to false advertising litigation, which is simpler and less expensive in most cases. These firms are on the lookout for false advertising, and companies know it.\n\nWhite Collar \u2013 Challenges from the inside and overseas The Dodd-Frank Act gave authorization to the SEC to reward whistleblowers who provide information that leads to successful enforcement actions. Within the last year, the SEC has increased its activity in this area, and in October, it announced more than $14 million in an investment fraud case\u2014the largest whistleblower payout to date. According to Crowell & Moring, actions like this could become increasingly familiar.\n\nTrade Secrets \u2013 Potential New Laws and New Risks Trade secret fraud has become an increasingly high profile issue, resulting in new legislation. The Private Right of Action Against Theft of Trade Secrets Act of 2013 would allow anyone who suffers injury as a result of violation of the Economic Espionage Act to seek damages, adding a civil cause of action to the existing criminal law.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Hannah Bender, PropertyCasualty360.com, Caterina Pontoriero, PropertyCasualty360.com", "description": "Crowell & Moring report forecasts the impact of NFL concussion lawsuits, Obamacare and more.", "og": {"url": "http://www.propertycasualty360.com/2014/01/27/top-9-litigation-trends-for-2014", "image": "http://media.propertycasualty360.com/propertycasualty360/article/2014/01/27/78431709.jpg", "type": "website", "description": "Crowell & Moring report forecasts the impact of NFL concussion lawsuits, Obamacare and more.", "title": "Top 9 Litigation Trends for 2014"}, "twitter": {"description": "Crowell & Moring report forecasts the impact of NFL concussion lawsuits, Obamacare and more.", "creator": "@PC_360", "image": {"src": "http://media.propertycasualty360.com/propertycasualty360/article/2014/01/27/78431709thumb-crop-120x120.jpg"}, "title": "Top 9 Litigation Trends for 2014", "site": "@PC_360", "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-01-27", "keywords": "E&S/Specialty, E&S/Specialty Business, Litigation, insurance professionals, Supreme Court, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, National Football League, Internal Revenue Service, insurance plan, e-discovery, National Intelligence, false advertising, criminal law, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, retail rates", "sailthru.tags": "propertycasualty360, article, 52e29efd150ba07b7a000085, Slideshow, E&S/Specialty,Litigation,E&S/Specialty Business", "sniply-options": "block", "sailthru.image.full": "http://media.propertycasualty360.com/propertycasualty360/article/2014/01/27/78431709.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde96d\"", "article_summary": "As litigation shows no signs of slowing in the next year, insurance professionals need to be aware of emerging litigation trends that may impact the industry, as well as their clients.\nCrowell & Moring, the 2013 \u201cWashington Litigation Department of the Year,\u201d recently published their annual Litigation Forecast, providing an expert look at legal trends, regulatory landscapes, and upcoming cases that could impact businesses, with both short- and long-term effects.\nSign In X Sign in with your ALM Account Remember Me Or...
