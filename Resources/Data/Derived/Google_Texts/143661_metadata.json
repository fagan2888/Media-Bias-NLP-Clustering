You order furniture thinking \u2018I got this\u2019 only to be greeted with an 18-page manual and enough bolts, washers, Allen wrenches and screws to assemble a damn house. I thought I bought an end table ends with why do I have three bolts left?\n\nMeet Greycork. The team of designers wants to upgrade your living room into something that doesn\u2019t resemble your old dorm, and is easy to assemble. As in no tools easy. I wonder if people collect Allen wrenches. I think I have 50 lying about\u2026\n\nOf course when you combine Rhode Island School of Design graduates with a team steeped in manufacturing, it all turns stylish in a damn hurry.\n\nFor now, the company is tackling the living room. It\u2019ll show up to your house in a flat-packed, 5-inch tick box. A sofa plus an optional chaise, side table, coffee table and a bookshelf.\n\nStylish. Cheaper. Zero tools. Four-minute assembly. They just brought your Pinterest board to life without the hassle.\n\nWhile you\u2019re probably thinking this is great for the new apartment, what about when you decide it\u2019s time to move? Typically you start posting on craigslist or one giant giveaway to friends and family.\n\nOr, you go the Alabama route and have a bonfire. Don\u2019t judge\u2026\n\nGreycork understands the needs of the 20-40-year old set. 82% want to move in the next year while 72% stay in their current home for one to three years. The furniture isn\u2019t just designed to be easy to assemble; it\u2019s designed to move with you.\n\nGreycork Living Room\n\nIt all starts with the sofa. Sitting three, it borrows design themes from both Japanese and American furniture design. The people behind Greycork are inspired by furniture designers such as George Nakashima and Charles and Ray Eames.\n\nThe sofa is designed to fall onto after a hard day at the office, or if you need a Netflix marathon. The seat cushions offer both support and the plushness we all want in our living room.\n\nThe back frame and legs are made from solid Ash, the same wood that goes into a baseball bat. For the base frame, a medium-density fiberwood is used to toss the cushions on.\n\nHow much hardware are you using? Six thumb nuts and six washers. That\u2019s it. No, you should not have extra ones lying around\u2026\n\nIt weighs 75 pounds, so you\u2019ll still need to bribe a friend to come over to help you slap it together.\n\nGreycork Indiegogo\n\nWhat about costs and delivery timeframes? In eight days, 189 people have topped the company\u2019s funding goal of $50,000. It\u2019s closing in on $80,000 with 33 days left on the campaign.\n\nCrowdfunding pricing saves you 33% off retail and the featured tier is for the sofa at $450 including shipping. Delivery timeframes are set for December.\n\nThe side table is $75, coffee table at $125, $180 for the bookshelf and $300 for the chaise. Besides the chaise, which also delivers in December, the complete Greycork living room can be in your house this January.\n\nIf you want the full Greycork set, pledge $1,000, and it will be delivered in January.\n\nLive Greycork\n\nLocated in Providence, RI, the company is opening up their loft on AirBnB. While the crowdfunding is for the living room set, the loft shows off where the company is heading. It\u2019s not a live listing, but it\u2019s coming soon for those looking to visit Providence.\n\nFor now, you can request an invite to the company\u2019s grand opening in Spring 2016. From there, you will get to tour the company\u2019s MA-based manufacturing plant.\n\nIt\u2019s damn nice and for a price that won\u2019t have you questioning your sanity when the bill comes due. And no Allen wrenches.
