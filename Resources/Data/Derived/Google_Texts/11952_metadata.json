One of the attackers was shot dead by police while the other was wounded and taken to a hospital.\n\n5:21 p.m.\n\nA Palestinian official says a visit by a delegation of international Mideast envoys has been postponed.\n\nThe official said the delegation from the \"Quartet\" of Mideast mediators had put off Wednesday's planned meeting at Israel's request. The official spoke on condition of anonymity pending a formal announcement.\n\nThe Quartet includes the United States, the European Union, Russia and the United Nations. A new date has not been set.\n\nThe announcement was a new setback to efforts to halt weeks of Israeli-Palestinian unrest.\n\n\u2014 Ian Deitch in Jerusalem\n\n___\n\n4:46 p.m.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has lashed out at Arab lawmakers in the Israeli parliament, accusing them of participating in what he says is incitement fueling a wave of unrest sweeping the country.\n\nIn an address to parliament Monday, Netanyahu accused Arab parties of \"undermining\" the country, saying that certain lawmakers have spoken in favor of violence against Israelis.\n\nHe called on Israel's Arab citizens to \"kick out the extremists among you.\"\n\nIsrael's Arab minority has full citizenship rights, but often suffers discrimination. Netanyahu, who just a few months ago warned his supporters that Arabs were voting in large numbers on election day, said he was committed to coexistence.\n\n___\n\n4:33 p.m.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Palestinian accusations that Israel is plotting to take over a sensitive Jerusalem holy site are an \"absolute lie.\"\n\nThe Palestinian claims against Israel have been a driving force in the wave of violence sweeping through Israel and the Palestinian territories in recent weeks.\n\nIn a speech to parliament Monday, Netanyahu dismissed the claims as \"incitement\" and said a series of stabbings of Israelis \"stems from the desire to annihilate us.\"\n\nHe called on the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, to condemn the violence.\n\nThe holy site in Jerusalem is sacred to Jews and Muslims, and has long been a flashpoint in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\n___\n\n4:00 p.m.\n\nIsraeli police say that in the latest Palestinian attack in Jerusalem an Israeli teen was stabbed while riding a bicycle.\n\nSpokesman Micky Rosenfeld said two Palestinians stabbed a 20 -year-old as he walked down a street. They then stabbed a 14-year-old Israeli riding his bicycle, wounding him critically.\n\nPolice say an Israeli civilian chased the two Palestinian attackers.\n\nOne of the attackers was apparently hit by a car and wounded. Police say they shot the other attacker and killed him when he ran at officers with a knife raised and ignored calls to stop.\n\nThe attack took place in Pisgat Zeev, a Jewish settlement in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem, which Israel seized in the 1967 war and annexed shortly thereafter. Palestinians want east Jerusalem as the capital of their future state.\n\nIsraeli media had previously reported different ages for the teen who was stabbed.\n\n__\n\n3:20 p.m.\n\nIsraeli police say two Palestinians stabbed two Israeli teens in Jerusalem in the latest such assault in over a week of bloody attacks.\n\nSpokeswoman Luba Samri said one of the Palestinian attackers was \"neutralized\" after stabbing the Israeli youth while his accomplice was caught after he ran away. She said the two Israeli victims are minors.\n\nIsrael's Channel 10 TV reported that Israeli forces shot one of the Palestinians after the attack Monday afternoon.\n\nEli Bin of Israel's emergency service said the two Israelis and the Palestinian attacker were treated for injuries.\n\nThe attack was in Pisgat Zeev on the outskirts of Jerusalem.\n\nIt was the latest in a rash of Palestinian attacks against Israelis.\n\n___\n\n2:45 p.m.\n\nIsraeli police say a Palestinian woman has lightly wounded a police officer in a stabbing attack in Jerusalem.\n\nPolice spokeswoman Luba Samri says the officer shot and wounded the woman, whose condition was not immediately known.\n\nSamri says the attack took place near Israeli police headquarters, in an area between the city's predominantly Arab eastern district and the predominantly Jewish western district.\n\n___\n\n9:15 a.m.\n\nIsraeli police are reporting that a Palestinian man attacked an Israeli officer with a knife and was shot dead by police.\n\nPolice said the attack early Monday took place near a gate of Jerusalem's walled Old City on the predominantly Arab eastern side of the city.\n\nIsraeli police spokeswoman Luba Samri says border police officers ordered the Palestinian to take his hand out of his pocket. She said the man then attacked the officer with a knife, but he was wearing a protective vest and was not injured.\n\nThe attack comes amid a recent wave of Israeli-Palestinian violence, marked primarily by Palestinian stabbing and shooting attacks.\n\nAt least 25 Palestinians, including nine attackers, have been killed by Israeli forces, while five Israelis have been killed in attacks.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Latest: Arab shot dead after stabbing Israeli soldier - AP News: JERUSALEM (AP) \u2014 The latest developments in ongoing violence between .05/27/2016 7:44:50AM EST.", "author": "AP News", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "JERUSALEM (AP) \u2014 The latest developments in ongoing violence between Palestinians and Israelis (all times", "title": "AP News - The Latest: Arab shot dead after stabbing Israeli soldier", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/world/2015/10/12/the-latest-palestinian-killed-after-attacking-israeli-n2064430", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015\\284\\58127c69-2724-457a-9c66-5679b3546a31.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "JERUSALEM (AP) \u2014 The latest developments in ongoing violence between Palestinians and Israelis (all times", "title": "AP News - The Latest: Arab shot dead after stabbing Israeli soldier", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/world/2015/10/12/the-latest-palestinian-killed-after-attacking-israeli-n2064430", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/284/58127c69-2724-457a-9c66-5679b3546a31.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "The Latest: Arab shot dead after stabbing Israeli soldier, AP News, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "Earlier on Monday, two teenage Palestinians stabbed and seriously injured an Israeli man before stabbing an Israeli teenager riding a bicycle, critically wounding him.\n___4:00 p.m.Israeli police say that in the latest Palestinian attack in Jerusalem an Israeli teen was stabbed while riding a bicycle.\n__3:20 p.m.Israeli police say two Palestinians stabbed two Israeli teens in Jerusalem in the latest such assault in over a week of bloody attacks.\nSpokesman Micky Rosenfeld said two Palestinians stabbed a 20 -year-old as he walked down a street.\n___9:15 a.m.Israeli police are reporting that a Palestinian man attacked an Israeli officer with a knife and was shot dead by police."}
