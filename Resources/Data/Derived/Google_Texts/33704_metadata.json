The total budget appropriations are $2.03 billion. The budget increases investments in health care, public safety and safety-net services for children and adults while, at the same time, increasing reserves 13 percent to $130 million, the highest level in County history. \"We are committed to long-term financial viability,\" said Mike Powers, County Executive Officer. \"We will continue to use the Board-approved Strategic Plan along with multiple-year forecasts to maintain a structural financial balance while still investing in our employees, infrastructure and technology. Thanks to the collaborative efforts of our employees, diligent management, and the support and direction of our Board, we have produced a structurally balanced budget that maintains our current service levels, and actually expands service levels in the critical areas of safety, health and social services.\" The preliminary budget reflects the gradual, but consistent, economic recovery seen in Ventura County and throughout the state, and takes into account the ongoing cost-savings the County is achieving by controlling overhead, administrative costs and improved efficiency. Because of the County's financial health, the budget maintains services that have been expanded recently (Public Safety Realignment, Affordable Care Act, and mental health services), and expands services in areas such as Adult Protective Services and Children's and Family Services. It also includes negotiated salary increases and market-based salary adjustments for some positions while continuing to make needed changes required under the Public Employees' Pension Reform Act. One such reform effort is 50/50 normal cost-sharing with employees. According to Paul Derse, Chief Financial Officer, \"The proposed budget provides the Board and County agencies with the financial resources they need to protect and enhance the well-being of our residents, infrastructure and environment.\" Other key items contained in the budget are: \u2022 Expanded service levels at the Ventura County Medical Center and its clinics to accommodate a 75 percent increase in MediCal patients.\n\n\u2022 Increased contribution to Health and Human Services departments for expanded services for children, adult and family services while improving and lowering case-load ratios.\n\n\u2022 County rates and fees maintained at current levels or with only slight increases in some areas.\n\n\u2022 Funding to incorporate known Federal Health Care Reform program changes.\n\n\u2022 Cost containment from self-managed insurance plans including the Ventura County Health Care Plan, Workers Compensation and General Liability.\n\n\u2022 Ongoing funding for homeless services including a contribution for the continuation of the Homeless Prevention and Rehousing Program.\n\n\u2022 Upgrades to the Sheriff's computer-aided dispatch system.\n\n\u2022 Construction of three replacement fire stations. The County maintains a transparency website that allows the public to easily see where County revenues come from and how they are used to deliver federal, state and locally mandated services. The site can be accessed by visiting the county's website (www.ventura.org) and clicking on the \"How We Spend Your Tax Dollars\" link, or by going directly to venturacountyca.opengov.com. Hearings to adopt the final budget will begin on Monday, June 15, at 1:30 p.m. in the Board of Supervisors Hearing Room at the Government Center. Public testimony on the budget will be received beginning at 6 p.m. that evening and continue during the week as necessary thereafter beginning daily at 9 a.m. until the budget hearings are closed. # # # Be the first to comment on this article. # # # #", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Ventura County Board of Supervisors received a structurally balanced fiscal year 2015-2016 \r\npreliminary budget at their regular meeting on June 2.", "title": "County Supervisors Prelim Budget - Public News - Ventura Edhat", "og": {"site_name": "Ventura Edhat", "description": "The Ventura County Board of Supervisors received a structurally balanced fiscal year 2015-2016 \r\npreliminary budget at their regular meeting on June 2.", "title": "County Supervisors Prelim Budget - Public News - Ventura Edhat", "url": "http://ventura.edhat.com/site/tidbit.cfm?nid=153883", "image": {"width": 380, "identifier": "http://edhat.com/logo-n.png", "height": 380}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "edhat.com", "site": "edhat", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 580642287, "app_id": 489526147858675}, "keywords": "Ventura, County, Board, Supervisors, received, structurally, balanced, fiscal, year, 2015-2016, preliminary, budget, regular, meeting, June, Edhat, Ventura", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-04", "modified_time": "2015-06-03T14:34"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbd75\"", "article_summary": "County Supervisors Prelim Budgetupdated: Jun 03, 2015, 2:34 PMSource: County of Ventura The Ventura County Board of Supervisors received a structurally balanced fiscal year 2015-2016 preliminary budget at their regular meeting on June 2.\n\u2022 Cost containment from self-managed insurance plans including the Ventura County Health Care Plan, Workers Compensation and General Liability.\nThe preliminary budget reflects the gradual, but consistent, economic recovery seen in Ventura County and throughout the state, and takes into account the ongoing cost-savings the County is achieving by controlling overhead, administrative costs and improved efficiency.\nOther key items contained in the budget are: \u2022 Expanded service levels at the Ventura County Medical Center and its clinics to accommodate a 75 percent increase in MediCal patients.\nThe budget increases investments in health care, public safety and safety-net services for children and adults while, at the same time, increasing reserves 13 percent to $130 million, the highest level in County history."}
