He cited numerous instances where tests were unsuccessful.\n\n\u201cThe results are not good and not consistent at all,\u201d Zaman wrote.\n\nChao responded to this report by emailing a stern warning to CMS staffers.\n\n\u201cI DO NOT WANT A REPEAT OF WHAT HAPPENED NEAR THE END OF DECEMBER 2005 WHERE MEDICARE.GOV HAD A MELTDOWN (THIS IS TO GET YOUR ATTENTION IF I DIDN\u2019T HAVE IT ALREADY),\u201d he said.\n\nOn Sept. 27, acting Director of the CMS Office of Enterprise Management David Nelson delivered Chao more bad news, saying the website\u2019s scripts were failing due to a variety of issues.\n\n\u201cWe have not been successful in moving beyond 500 concurrent users filling applications without income verification,\u201d he said.\n\nEnergy and Commerce Committee Chairman Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., said the documents are more evidence that the Obama administration went \u201cout of its way\u201d to cover up the chaos behind the scenes at Healthcare.gov.\n\n\u201cThe frenzied lead up to October 1, coupled with the inadequate testing and numerous systems failures, reveal an administration that was not up to the job despite over three years to prepare,\u201d Upton said.\n\nDocuments released earlier this week by the committee revealed the Obama administration was warned as early as March about potential risks with the implementation of HealthCare.gov. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney also acknowledged on Tuesday that President Obama was briefed at the time.", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/EXECUTIVE/Health care", "dcterms.modified": "2015-02-02 01:27:41 EST", "dcterms.abstract": "The emails from Sept. 26-30, which were discovered by the House Energy and Commerce Committee as part of its investigation into the troubled Healthcare.gov, highlight troubling results as CMS officials ran tests on the site.", "twitter": {"description": "The emails from Sept. 26-30, which were discovered by the House Energy and Commerce Committee as part of its investigation into the troubled Healthcare.gov, highlight troubling results as CMS officials ran tests on the site.", "creator": "@foxnews", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/11/22/emails-show-obamacare-website-got-poor-performance-report-days-before-launch.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/thumbnails/i/112113/0/0/112113_rosen_obamacare_640.jpg?ve=1", "title": "Emails shed light on serious problems with ObamaCare website before launch", "site": "@foxnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "parsely-metadata": "{\"tags\":[\"/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/EXECUTIVE/Health care\"],\"author\":\"\",\"subSection\":\"politics\",\"title\":\"Emails shed light on serious problems with ObamaCare website before launch\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/thumbnails/i/112113/0/0/112113_rosen_obamacare_640.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-11-22T09:15:10Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/11/22/emails-show-obamacare-website-got-poor-performance-report-days-before-launch.html\",\"type\":\"article\",\"identifier\":\"58680df5-b723-4744-b0ba-0f65cef7ff0e\",\"section\":\"politics\"}", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "prism.channel": "fnc", "dc.description": "The emails from Sept. 26-30, which were discovered by the House Energy and Commerce Committee as part of its investigation into the troubled Healthcare.gov, highlight troubling results as CMS officials ran tests on the site.", "dc.identifier": "58680df5-b723-4744-b0ba-0f65cef7ff0e", "dc.language": "en-US", "pagetype": "article", "classification-isa": "healthcare", "description": "The emails from Sept. 26-30, which were discovered by the House Energy and Commerce Committee as part of its investigation into the troubled Healthcare.gov, highlight troubling results as CMS officials ran tests on the site.", "prism.section": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 113186182048399}, "dc.source": "FoxNews.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "dc.title": "Emails Shed Light On Serious Problems With Obamacare Website Before Launch", "dcterms.created": "2015-02-02 01:27:41 EST", "og": {"site_name": "Fox News", "description": "The emails from Sept. 26-30, which were discovered by the House Energy and Commerce Committee as part of its investigation into the troubled Healthcare.gov, highlight troubling results as CMS officials ran tests on the site.", "title": "Emails shed light on serious problems with ObamaCare website before launch | Fox News", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/11/22/emails-show-obamacare-website-got-poor-performance-report-days-before-launch.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/thumbnails/i/112113/0/0/112113_rosen_obamacare_640.jpg?ve=1", "type": "article"}, "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.date": "2013-11-22", "parsely-page": "{\"tags\":[\"/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/EXECUTIVE/Health care\"],\"author\":\"\",\"subSection\":\"politics\",\"title\":\"Emails shed light on serious problems with ObamaCare website before launch\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/thumbnails/i/112113/0/0/112113_rosen_obamacare_640.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-11-22T09:15:10Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/11/22/emails-show-obamacare-website-got-poor-performance-report-days-before-launch.html\",\"post_id\":\"58680df5-b723-4744-b0ba-0f65cef7ff0e\",\"type\":\"article\",\"section\":\"politics\"}"}, "article_summary": "Documents released earlier this week by the committee revealed the Obama administration was warned as early as March about potential risks with the implementation of HealthCare.gov.\nNewly released emails between top Obama administration tech officials are shedding more light on the severity of the concerns that were raised before the disastrous rollout of the ObamaCare website, with one official saying \u201cthe results are not good\u201d just days before the Oct. 1 launch.\nWhite House Press Secretary Jay Carney also acknowledged on Tuesday that President Obama was briefed at the time.\n\u201cWe have not been successful in moving beyond 500 concurrent users filling applications without income verification,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe results are not good and not consistent at all,\u201d Zaman wrote."}
