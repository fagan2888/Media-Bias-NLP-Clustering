That, in fact, is one of the core tenants of the contemporary environmental justice movement.\n\nProponents of environmental justice point toward crises looming on the horizon: President Obama is urging new and quick action in reducing carbon emissions and greenhouse gases; California is strategizing a way past its crippling drought; and urban megacities are searching for new models of development that use less resources and generate less waste.\n\nBut the project of ensuring a secure future for our planet can\u2019t rely on the innovation of science alone. We need economic innovators, too. That was the message from Peggy Shepard, executive director at WE ACT for Environmental Justice, a New York-based advocacy organization, at a recent event at The Museum of the City of New York, co-presented by the Museum and New America NYC.\n\nShepard was joined in discussion by Ashley White, a young graduate of the Green City Force Corps; Bomee Jung, Deputy Director of the New York City Office of Enterprise Community Partners, Inc.; and Donnel Baird, founder of BlocPower, all of whom confronted head on common assumptions that sustainable development is more expensive and makes little economic sense. On the contrary, a healthy environment requires \u2014 and helps reinforce \u2014 a healthy economy.\n\nShepard, who co-founded WE ACT almost 25 years ago, first got turned on to the intersection between environment and economy as the Democratic district leader in her West Harlem neighborhood, where various utility mismanagement struggles came across her radar. Long-neglected and releasing noxious emissions into a residential neighborhood already plagued by poor levels of air quality, the North River Sewage Treatment Plant was a particular problem in Shepard\u2019s district. Another was the absence of an efficient and functional bus depot in northern Manhattan.\n\nThe green benefits for the community in advocating for a more environmentally compliant treatment facility and an alternative fuel-operated bus depot were obvious. But WE ACT managed to achieve those benefits while simultaneously creating new jobs and ensuring more long-term government accountability in maintaining both facilities. In both cases, the community was key to a successful outcome, Shepard said. WE ACT\u2019s wins were directly born out of using \u201cmodels of community organizing and public policy [that allow] residents [to] integrate in and directly influence policy.\u201d\n\nWE ACT\u2019s community-centered approach has caught on in addressing all types of environmental and economic issues \u2014 affordable housing development, urban gardening and food distribution, and alternative energy, to name a few.\n\nWith her work with Green City Force Corps, White acknowledged the constructive power of the community in the huge gains her organization has made. They have planted urban farms in otherwise unused lots which have yielded 3.6 tons of new of produce by and for residents of Red Hook, Brooklyn, a lower-resourced neighborhood often considered a \u201cfood desert.\u201d\n\nIn many of the same communities, Jung\u2019s work has transformed amassed assets \u2013 the resources accrued by developers through market-race contracts along with the government and tax incentives they receive for committing to new ownership and new building within the city \u2014 directly into policy solutions by adjusting city planning regulations for building contracts to include provisions for affordable housing developments that adhere to higher environmental standards. At BlocPower, Baird is leading the effort to invest in public-private partnerships and employ solar and energy efficiency technology to slash both energy consumption and cost.\n\nTaken together, these four pioneers are just a few of the cohort of entrepreneurs working to prove that\u2014through the right combined forces of local empowerment, public and government investment, and private sector support\u2014we can be greener, healthier, and more productive while becoming more economically viable.\n\nTo be sure, there\u2019s still work to be done. Shepard observed that government still hasn\u2019t become effectively responsive to community needs. If our environmental footprint is going to get any better, Shepard noted, residents and neighborhood stakeholders have to be put at \u201cthe center of efforts for change so they become informed and empowered enough to take their own actions.\u201d Just think: if more residents and fewer bureaucrats were invited to testify in front of city planning commissions and participate in green task forces, how much more consensus and momentum could be generated?\n\nIf urban green innovators like Shepard, White, Baird, and Jung are any indication, the environmental-economic future looks bright, but that doesn\u2019t mean they they\u2019re resting comfortably on the laurels of their breakthroughs. To the contrary, they\u2019re always thinking about the next big benchmark for progress. In a society where dollars gained and lost are the go-to arbiters of risk and success, there are still too few companies that see their business impacts outside of environmental terms, and vice versa. But if we see environmental justice as connected to \u2014 and often the same as \u2014 economic justice, they both win.\n\nAs Shepard put it, environmental activism isn\u2019t just about \u201cstopping the bad stuff,\u201d but about cultivating a system that creates the new \u2014 new technology, new partnerships, and (sooner than we think) new ways of thinking about the world we all want to live in.\n\nTyler S.
