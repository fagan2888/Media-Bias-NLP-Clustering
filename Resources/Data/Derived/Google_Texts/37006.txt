The woman representing Illinois' Seventeenth District says it's time for lawmakers to stop fighting and start fixing.

Representative Cheri Bustos is a member of No Labels, a bi-partisan group she says is urging both parties to get back to the table. Bustos argues issues such as health care should be able to be discussed without a government shutdown.

"There are components of the Affordable Care Act that absolutely we need to address. There also components that are very good for so many people," Bustos said. "But let's keep in there what's good. Let's fix what's broken. But let's not do it with this threat that the government has to remain closed, or we won't sit down and talk."

The other congressman representing the Rockford area, Sixteenth District Representative Adam Kinzinger also attended the No Labels meeting. His press secretary says he is waiting on the latest meetings with House and Senate leaders before commenting on the situation.
