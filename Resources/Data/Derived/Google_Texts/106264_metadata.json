Samuelsson told Reuters that the company aims to sell 200,000 units in Asia Pacific by 2020, one quarter of its planned global sales, with China accounting for the bulk. The automaker sold nearly 82,000 cars in China last year. Growing sales in China has become key to Volvo's revitalization strategy since Geely purchased the troubled Swedish automaker in 2010.
