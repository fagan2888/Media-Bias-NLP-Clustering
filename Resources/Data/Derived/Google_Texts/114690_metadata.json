We still have a long way to go. Essentially what we did was stabilize it, lay a new foundation to move forward. As I said in the State of the Union address, that gives us, now the capacity to tackle what was an overriding theme of my campaign way back in 2008. And that is to restore middle class economics and the capacity for people to get into the middle class and start seeing higher wages and a broader shared prosperity inside the United States.\u201d\n\n\u201cInternationally, I\u2019m proud of the fact that we\u2019ve responsibly ended two wars. Now, people will say, well, you\u2019re back in Iraq, but we\u2019re not back in Iraq with an occupying army, we\u2019re back with a coalition of 60 countries helping to stabilize the situation,\u201d he added.\n\nHe concluded, \u201cAnd so one of the things I\u2019ve learned in this job over the last six years is that sometimes progress is incremental. But when I look at overall the steps that we\u2019ve taken, I believe they are the right ones. I am very confident that America is stronger, more prosperous, safer, and more influential today than it was when I took office.\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obama: I've Made U.S. Stronger, More Prosperous, Safer, More Influential", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Obama: I've Made U.S. Stronger, More Prosperous, Safer, More Influential", "title": "Obama: I've Made the US Stronger, More Prosperous, Safer, More Influential - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/02/obam2.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/02/01/obama-ive-made-the-us-stronger-more-prosperous-safer-more-influential/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Obama: I've Made U.S. Stronger, More Prosperous, Safer, More Influential", "creator": "@pamkeyNEN", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/02/obam2.jpg", "title": "Obama: I've Made the US Stronger, More Prosperous, Safer, More Influential - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Obama,Breitbart TV, Economics, Obama,Obama", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Breitbart TV", "tag": "Obama", "published_time": "2015-02-01T08:52:56-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV,Obama,Economics"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0cce\"", "article_summary": "I am very confident that America is stronger, more prosperous, safer, and more influential today than it was when I took office.\u201dFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN\nHe concluded, \u201cAnd so one of the things I\u2019ve learned in this job over the last six years is that sometimes progress is incremental.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTEROn CNN\u2019s \u201cFareed Zakaria GPS,\u201d President Barack Obama said he was most proud of \u201csaving the American economy\u201d and he is\u201dvery confident that America is stronger, more prosperous, safer, and more influential today than it was when I took office.\u201dSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe president said, \u201cI\u2019m proud of saving the American economy.\nBut when I look at overall the steps that we\u2019ve taken, I believe they are the right ones.\nEssentially what we did was stabilize it, lay a new foundation to move forward."}
