John Bonacic, R-Mount Hope, and state Assemblywoman Aileen Gunther, D-Forestburgh, both said that the move toward a $15 per hour minimum wage is happening too fast for all of the variables to be taken into account and reformed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to go there unless there\u2019s balance,\u201d Bonacic said.\n\nAssemblyman Karl Brabenec, R-Deerpark, said the GOP minority conference has been pushing for years to address some of the variables and, with those addressed, raising the minimum wage may not be the answer.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been pushing for these reforms for years: less regulation, less unfunded mandates, lower taxes across the board; that\u2019s what\u2019s going to create economic vitality, not a minimum wage increase,\u201d said Brabenec. \u201cWe want people to have a living wage, but we want people to have a job where they can make $40,000, $50,000, $60,000 per year, a skilled job.\u201d\n\nSen. William Larkin, R-Cornwall-on-Hudson, said he faced those concerns years ago when he owned a business.\n\n\u201cI had to pay you every week,\u201d Larkin said. \u201cNow, if you want me to move from $9 to $15 (per hour) for the counter, everybody, what about the guy that does the machine, that does the pressing? He\u2019s making $15. I\u2019ve got to raise his pay. The devil is in the details; it\u2019s easy for these people in Washington ... saying \u2018We ought to raise the minimum wage.\u2019 Maybe, we ought to start looking very closely at what we spend some of the money on.\u201d\n\nAlthough many of those concerns are from a Republican perspective, Democratic Assemblyman James Skoufis, D-Woodbury, said, the minimum wage \u201cis not a black-and-white issue.\u201d\n\nSkoufis said a majority of minimum wage earners are employed by large corporate entities, such as Walmart, and that, because the minimum wage is so low, some of those full-time workers qualify for public assistance in addition to their wages and that, in itself, is creating a financial issue.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "News, Kingston news, NY news, US news, world news.", "title": "Minimum wage takes center stage in Orange County business community discussion with state lawmakers", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailyfreeman.com/article/DF/20160115/NEWS/160119804", "image": {"width": "800px", "identifier": "http://www.dailyfreeman.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/DF/20160115/NEWS/160119804/AR/0/AR-160119804.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "264px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Minimum wage takes center stage in Orange County business community discussion with state lawmakers"}, "twitter": {"domain": "dailyfreeman.com", "description": "TOWN OF WALLKILL, N.Y. >> As the 2016 session of the state Legislature opens, members of both houses discussed issues before them with members of the Orange County Chamber of Commerce on Thursday.", "title": "Minimum wage takes center stage in Orange County business community discussion with state lawmakers", "url": "http://www.dailyfreeman.com/article/DF/20160115/NEWS/160119804", "image": {"src": "http://www.dailyfreeman.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/DF/20160115/NEWS/160119804/AR/0/AR-160119804.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@dailyfreeman", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id551766152", "iphone": "id520227762", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.dailyfreeman"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "7051e795f40b676ce04748f545d28049"}, "keywords": "News, Kingston news, NY news, US news, world news.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "TOWN OF WALLKILL, N.Y. >> As the 2016 session of the state Legislature opens, members of both houses discussed issues before them with members of the Orange County Chamber of Commerce on Thursday."}, "article_summary": "County Executive Steven Neuhaus, a Republican, said he has already felt pressure from the local business community on this topic.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been pushing for these reforms for years: less regulation, less unfunded mandates, lower taxes across the board; that\u2019s what\u2019s going to create economic vitality, not a minimum wage increase,\u201d said Brabenec.\nAssemblyman Karl Brabenec, R-Deerpark, said the GOP minority conference has been pushing for years to address some of the variables and, with those addressed, raising the minimum wage may not be the answer.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the way to get a minimum wage adjusted.\u201dAdvertisementState Sen.
