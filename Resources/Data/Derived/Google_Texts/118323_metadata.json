Whether you use the classic \u201csmell and evaluate\u201d test, or prolong doing laundry as long as possible, you\u2019re probably letting all the nasty stuff you acquire throughout your day accumulate on your favorite pair of jeans. But how often should you actually be washing your clothes? A new video by Brit Lab helps us figure out if it\u2019s time to finally bite the bullet and go to the laundromat.\n\nAll human beings are pretty gross, if you truly think about it. We are constantly secreting strange substances, and shedding layers of skin; in fact, we shed up to 500 million skin cells, and secrete one liter of sweat each day. But on its own, sweat isn\u2019t that smelly. It\u2019s the bacteria living on your skin, which thrives by breaking down sweat and skin cells, that makes sweat the stench we\u2019ve grown to revile. For example, Staphylococcus epidermidis bacteria, or the bacteria that lives on your skin, will break down amino acids in sweat and create a similar type of smell you\u2019d find in stinky cheese.\n\nBut when it comes down to it, apocrine sweat is probably the worst brew we\u2019ve got. Found near the genitals, breasts, under arms, and your eyelids, apocrine sweat glands mature at puberty and lead to the smelliest of smells. And guess where all of this is going? Your clothes.\n\nLuckily, modern detergent is quite the smart invention, using surfactants that make stains water soluble, and easier to rinse away. But the question still remains: With all the stink and potential infections lying on our clothes, how often should we wash them away?\n\nThat seems to depend on the clothing item. Articles of clothing that are closer to those areas where apocrine sweat is active, like t-shirts, underwear, vests, and socks, should be washed each day. Towels, which also tend to grow bacteria because of their damp environments should be washed at most, three days after use. Pajamas too should be washed sooner than you think. A professor from the London School of Hygiene and Topical Medicine said you need to put those in the wash after a week of wear to prevent the possibility of infection.\n\nBut what about that pair of jeans you want to keep from fading? That seems to be up to you. If you care about style more than cleanliness, you may not wash your jeans for over a month\u2019s time. But, if you\u2019re into skinny jeans that hug most parts of you, it\u2019s probably wise to wash those regularly.\n\nTo learn more, watch the video above.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "dirty, laundry, contains, lots, sweat, and, bacteria, accumulated, throughout, day, meaning, you", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Human beings are gross and need to wash their clothes more.", "title": "Chances Are You're Not Doing Laundry Often Enough [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/dirty-laundry-contains-lots-sweat-and-bacteria-accumulated-throughout-day-meaning-you-353062", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/09/17/science-laundry-sweat-and-bacteria-build-during-day-mean-you-should-wash-your-clothes.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Human beings are gross and need to wash their clothes more.", "title": "Chances Are You're Not Doing Laundry Often Enough [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/dirty-laundry-contains-lots-sweat-and-bacteria-accumulated-throughout-day-meaning-you-353062", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/09/17/science-laundry-sweat-and-bacteria-build-during-day-mean-you-should-wash-your-clothes.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/09/17/science-laundry-sweat-and-bacteria-build-during-day-mean-you-should-wash-your-clothes.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-09-17T14:02:21-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-17T14:02:18-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Human beings are gross and need to wash their clothes more."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd369e\"", "article_summary": "Found near the genitals, breasts, under arms, and your eyelids, apocrine sweat glands mature at puberty and lead to the smelliest of smells.\nBut when it comes down to it, apocrine sweat is probably the worst brew we\u2019ve got.\nArticles of clothing that are closer to those areas where apocrine sweat is active, like t-shirts, underwear, vests, and socks, should be washed each day.\nIt\u2019s the bacteria living on your skin, which thrives by breaking down sweat and skin cells, that makes sweat the stench we\u2019ve grown to revile.\nBut, if you\u2019re into skinny jeans that hug most parts of you, it\u2019s probably wise to wash those regularly."}
