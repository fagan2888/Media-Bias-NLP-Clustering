Pafford\u2019s won-loss record rivals that of the Washington Generals, the Harlem Globetrotters\u2019 longtime opponents.\n\nBut the liberal-leaning Democrat said he\u2019s proud to have given his party\u2019s 4.5 million voters a voice \u2013 even one that is steadily drowned out by a conservative majority.\n\nHouse Republicans hold 81 of the chamber\u2019s 120 seats.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t sent up here to pass bills, but to speak where I can and represent my constituency,\u201d said Pafford, 49, first elected in 2008. His district includes Wellington, Loxahatchee Groves and Royal Palm Beach.\n\n+ Mark Pafford \u00d7\n\nHe is term-limited this year and says this is his last go-around at elected office.\n\nPafford\u2019s early political vision \u2014 promoting policies that enhance environmental causes and boost the lives of poor Floridians \u2014 has been tempered by the system.\n\nHe\u2019s frustrated.\n\n\u201cBut you know, voters back home have never blinked,\u201d Pafford said. \u201cThey believe that having a minority voice is very valuable. When you have that kind of support behind you, you can keep going.\u201d\n\nLegislature sailing through the Florida House over Democratic opposition this year includes advancing the open carrying of firearms and guns on campus by concealed weapons permit holders, hydraulic fracturing, and anti-immigration\n\nJust last week, the House approved a ballot question on term limits for judges and Florida Supreme Court justices \u2013 a move decried by critics as payback by Republicans angry with courts that have challenged some of the Legislature\u2019s more sweeping policy moves of recent years.\n\nAgain, House Democrats formed an easily surmountable barrier.\n\nDemocrats, however, have swung mightily against each of the measures \u2013 and as budget talks begin in earnest this week in Tallahassee, Pafford will spearhead efforts to prod ruling Republicans to boost spending on schools, social services and many coveted hometown projects.\n\nIt\u2019s an uphill fight.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy with what Mark Pafford has done. But I\u2019m not happy with the Legislature,\u201d said Sam Oser, an activist with the Century Village Democratic Club of West Palm Beach, a community within Pafford\u2019s district.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too much like Congress. And what they\u2019re passing, sometimes it\u2019s just insane,\u201d he said.\n\nHouse Republican Leader Dana Young of Tampa acknowledged that \u201cit is difficult when you are a distinct minority in any chamber.\n\n\u201cBut my Democratic colleagues have been very open with us\u2026.and debate remains professional,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d say our interpersonal relationships are very positive.\u201d\n\nWhen told that many Democrats view the House as an autocratic, top-down chamber, where most action is decided by House Speaker Steve Crisafulli, R-Merritt Island, and a few lieutenants, Young paused.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you why they\u2019d say that,\u201d she said.\n\nThe more moderate Senate has put the brakes on many of the House\u2019s more controversial stands this session. And court-ordered redistricting is likely to tighten Republicans\u2019 26-14 seat majority in the Senate \u2013 meaning Democrats there may become more influential even as the House remains overwhelmingly Republican.\n\nRegistered Democrats still outnumber Republicans in Florida by 300,000 voters. But the Legislature, governor\u2019s office and Cabinet seats are all controlled by the GOP, with the House expected to remain solidly Republican for years to come.\n\n\u201cIt looks like the worst job in the Capitol. It\u2019s a thankless job,\u201d Sen. Jeff Clemens, D-Atlantis, said of Pafford\u2019s leadership post.\n\nClemens is in line to become Senate Democratic leader following the 2018 elections.\n\n\u201cMark has given his heart and soul to the job,\u201d Clemens said. \u201cAnd he\u2019s gotten very little back for it. But I think he\u2019s earned the undying gratitude of people who didn\u2019t have a voice.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Pafford has tried to instill some history in House Democrats.\n\nThe Democratic suite on the third floor of the Capitol includes black-and-white photographs of party leaders and events from the 122 years following Reconstruction when Democrats controlled Florida government.\n\nThe Legislature has now been in Republican hands for 20 years. And Pafford fears the party\u2019s role as a minority is becoming engrained.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t remember that a Bob Graham or a Lawton Chiles was once in the Legislature,\u201d said Pafford. \u201cWe\u2019re losing an institutional memory that I\u2019m hoping we can keep alive.\u201d\n\nPafford also said he is proud of bringing some stability back to a caucus. And some scrap.\n\nPafford had to fight for the leadership post \u2013 first being selected in 2013 following a revolt among caucus members who unseated Rep. Darryl Rouson, D-St. Petersburg, as leader.\n\nAfter House Democrats lost six seats in the 2014 elections that also saw the re-election of Gov. Rick Scott, Pafford drew heat and a leadership challenge that he managed to fend off.\n\n\u201cI wish we could\u2019ve been a more powerful, relevant caucus in the House,\u201d Rouson said. \u201cBut in his own way, Mark has done what he can do. I know he is frustrated.\u201d\n\nAfter eight years in elected office, Pafford said he is ready to work outside politics. In private life, he is chief executive officer of Florida CHAIN, the health care advocacy organization that has been central in enrolling Floridians for coverage under the federal Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s consumer driven advocacy,\u201d Pafford said of his job. \u201cAnd at this point, I realize that with the right knowledge and right commitment, you can achieve more success from the outside than on the inside.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Florida House Democratic Leader Mark Pafford of West Palm Beach is nearing the end of his term heading outnumbered Democrats in the chamber.", "author": "By John Kennedy - Palm Beach Post Capital Bureau", "og": {"url": "http://www.mypalmbeachpost.com/news/news/state-regional-govt-politics/rep-mark-pafford-nears-end-of-his-term-in-worst-jo/nqYsQ/", "image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2016/02/28/07/3a/Pafford.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Florida House Democratic Leader Mark Pafford of West Palm Beach is nearing the end of his term heading outnumbered Democrats in the chamber.", "title": "Pafford nears end of 2-year run as House Democratic leader"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/resize/120x120/img/photos/2016/02/28/07/3a/Pafford.jpg", "description": "Florida House Democratic Leader Mark Pafford of West Palm Beach is nearing the end of a two-year stretch in what one of his colleagues called the \u201cworst job in the Capitol.", "card": "summary", "title": "Rep.
