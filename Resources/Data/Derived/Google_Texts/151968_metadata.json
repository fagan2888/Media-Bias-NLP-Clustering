(David Becker/AP)\n\nThe early success and popularity of Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign is raising big questions about the future of the Republican Party. And now a similar dynamic is taking shape in the Democratic contest, where Bernie Sanders has defied expectations with his grassroots challenge of Hillary Clinton \u2014 turning their primary race in New Hampshire into a fight over the future and soul of the Democratic Party.\n\nSharply Contrasting Visions\n\nThe race between Clinton and Sanders was expressed succinctly by the two candidates at the end of last week in New Hampshire, before they headed out to Iowa.\n\n\u201cWe have had enough of establishment politics, establishment economics,\u201d Sanders said at a rally in Wolfeboro. \u201cWe need to move in a bold direction.\u201d\n\nThe next day, speaking to supporters in Rochester, Clinton asked: \u201cAre we going to try to build on the progress we\u2019ve made under President Obama, or are we going to rip it up and start all over again?\u201d\n\nSo in two phrases, there\u2019s the choice voters face.\n\nThere are Democrats like Joan Valentine, of Madbury, New Hampshire. She\u2019s a longtime Clinton supporter and says she\u2019s sticking with her.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s worked hard for better education, for children and family issues, for women\u2019s issues,\u201d Valentine said. \u201cI think it\u2019s high time we have a woman president, and I think she\u2019s the most qualified person running in the whole field.\u201d\n\nBut Sheryl Lang, an undeclared voter from Ossipee, is supporting Sanders because she says he understands the struggles of working people like her.\n\n\u201cLike he is, I\u2019m mad. I\u2019m angry. I don\u2019t like what\u2019s happening. I think that we need to shake things up,\u201d Lang said. \u201cWe need someone who stands up for us middle people. And I think he\u2019s doing a great job of that.\u201d\n\nTwo sharply contrasting visions of where the Democratic Party needs to go. Clinton embraces the legacy of President Obama and the Democratic Party establishment. Sanders calls for a new direction, even \u201ca political revolution.\u201d\n\nHow Stark Is The Choice?\n\n\u201cThis is a battle for the soul of the Democratic Party and the future of a more progressive politics in America,\u201d says Bill Curry, a former White House adviser to President Bill Clinton. Curry ran for governor of Connecticut a couple of times and now writes for Salon.com.\n\n\u201cThis is a battle for the soul of the Democratic Party and the future of a more progressive politics in America.\u201d \u2013 Bill Curry\n\nA critic of Hillary Clinton, Curry says Sanders has a chance to upend the Democratic establishment that Clinton represents.\n\n\u201cIf this is framed as a set of policy choices and a set of value choices, I think Sanders wins \u2014 certainly in Iowa, certainly in New Hampshire, and then after that, who knows. I think all bets are off.\u201d\n\nAs Curry sees it, those policy and value choices have to do with correcting a political system that no longer works for average Americans.\n\nAt campaign events, Sanders talks a lot about what he calls \u201cthe grotesque level of income inequality\u201d in America. And he gets specific about how a corrupt system benefits the very rich, and why it makes so many New Hampshire voters angry.\n\n\u201cIt has a lot to do with the fact that there are kids in New Hampshire, kids in Vermont who get arrested for possessing marijuana. And yet when you are the CEO or a major executive of a multi, multi-billion dollar financial institution, which helped crash the economy because of their greed, recklessness and illegal behavior, you do not get a police record,\u201d Sanders said at a recent event. \u201cThat is wrong, that has got to change.\u201d\n\nLike Sanders, Curry is critical of Clinton for accepting Wall Street money while promising to reign in its excesses. He sees a stark choice for progressives between what he calls \u201cthe pay-to-play system of the Clinton-Obama years,\u201d and Sanders\u2019 message of progressive social change.\n\nBut there\u2019s a debate among Democrats about how stark this choice really is.\n\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t a dime\u2019s worth of difference between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton on virtually all of the issues.\u201d \u2013 Michael Dukakis\n\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t a dime\u2019s worth of difference between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton on virtually all of the issues,\u201d says Michael Dukakis, the former Massachusetts governor and one-time Democratic presidential nominee.\n\nDukakis says both candidates fundamentally agree on core issues, including the need for higher wages, making health care more affordable, combating climate change and even going after those one percenters.\n\n\u201cWe should make everybody making a million dollars or more have to pay a 30 percent income tax rate \u2014 that is an effective rate that actually produces income,\u201d Clinton said last week in Rochester. \u201cBecause it\u2019s wrong that you\u2019ve got millionaires and billionaires whose tax rate is lower than their secretaries.\u201d\n\nDukakis says seeking out differences between the candidates is something that always happens.\n\n\u201cWhen you have candidates, who are very much in the same political world philosophically and otherwise, as the thing starts to heat up, and it always does, people start looking for differences,\u201d Dukakis says. \u201cBut there is very little difference between them.\u201d\n\nFinding Real Differences\n\nBut drill down a bit into their positions, and you do find real differences. Perhaps the best example of that is health care.\n\nSanders thinks the country needs to move toward \u201ca Medicare for all single-payer program.\u201d\n\nClinton might have agreed with that back in 1993 \u2014 when she led a failed effort to pass national health insurance. Now, she says, given what\u2019s politically feasible, it makes sense to embrace and improve Obamacare \u2014 which now covers 90 percent of Americans.\n\n\u201cI will defend the Affordable Care Act against efforts to repeal it or start over, because I know we can make it better, but I sure also know we don\u2019t want to go back into a really contentious national debate about health care \u2014 that is a recipe for gridlock,\u201d Clinton said recently.\n\nBut Sanders points to higher and higher deductibles, 19 million Americans still uninsured and many more under-insured. Clinton\u2019s critics \u2014 like Bill Curry \u2014 say the Affordable Care Act represents a give-away to the insurance and pharmaceutical industries, and no amount of tinkering with it can change that fact.\n\n\u201cThis system is addicted to the past, it\u2019s addicted to the powerful and it\u2019s addicted to money,\u201d Curry says. \u201cAnd that is the reason we can\u2019t fix health care.\u201d\n\nSo does that mean Clinton is in the hands of corporate interests, or just pragmatic, smart enough to recognize what\u2019s possible? Dukakis says the latter.\n\nWhich brings us to why he\u2019s supporting Clinton. He agrees with a lot of what Sanders says, but he thinks the Republican attack machine will savage the 74-year-old democratic socialist.\n\n\u201cAnything and everything you\u2019ve done, and a lot of things you haven\u2019t done, are used against you,\u201d Dukakis says. \u201cI mean, I had an incumbent Republican president who referred to me as the invalid one day \u2014 and set off a firestorm about my mental health and psychological stability. It was all nuts. I think I dropped 8 points in a week.\u201d\n\nOf course, Clinton has a long history too, and remains the focus of an FBI investigation \u2014 all fodder for that attack machine. So it comes down to two competing visions of the Democratic Party.\n\nMaybe Purnell Ross has the right idea. He\u2019s a longtime Democrat who\u2019s supporting Clinton, but says he also likes a lot of Sanders\u2019 ideas.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to see them run as a couple, quite frankly,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019d be a win-win for all of us.\u201d\n\nStory continues below\n\nMost Popular Expand", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bernie Sanders has defied expectations with his grassroots challenge of Hillary Clinton -- turning their primary race in New Hampshire into a fight over the future and soul of the Democratic Party.", "og": {"site_name": "wbur", "description": "Bernie Sanders has defied expectations with his grassroots challenge of Hillary Clinton -- turning their primary race in New Hampshire into a fight over the future and soul of the Democratic Party.", "title": "In New Hampshire, Clinton And Sanders Battle For The Future Of The Democratic Party", "url": "http://www.wbur.org/2016/01/29/clinton-sander-future-democratic-party", "image": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/1/files/2016/01/AP_263966352519-620x491.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.wbur.org/2016/01/29/clinton-sander-future-democratic-party", "image": "//s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/1/files/2016/01/AP_263966352519-620x491.jpg", "site": "@wbur", "card": "summary", "title": "In New Hampshire, Clinton And Sanders Battle For The Future Of The Democratic Party"}, "DC.date.issued": "2016-01-29", "fb": {"admins": 1549080028, "app_id": 134067973330252}, "msvalidate.01": "D02D46BAEDB3F81FC1B1DE2A8CB69551", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThis is a battle for the soul of the Democratic Party and the future of a more progressive politics in America.\u201d \u2013 Bill CurryA critic of Hillary Clinton, Curry says Sanders has a chance to upend the Democratic establishment that Clinton represents.\nBernie Sanders has defied expectations with his grassroots challenge of Hillary Clinton -- turning their primary race in New Hampshire into a fight over the future and soul of the Democratic Party.\nSo it comes down to two competing visions of the Democratic Party.\nAnd I think he\u2019s doing a great job of that.\u201dTwo sharply contrasting visions of where the Democratic Party needs to go.\nClinton embraces the legacy of President Obama and the Democratic Party establishment."}
