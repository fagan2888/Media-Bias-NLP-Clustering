Patent office records show Apple first applied in 2012 for the patent, which was granted Tuesday.\n\nBut one tech analyst cautioned against reading too much into the filing. \u201cApple develops and patents lots and lots of technology all the time. Only a fraction of it ever sees the light of day in commercial products,\u201d said Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research, who tracks consumer tech products.\n\nApple already has developed sophisticated camera technology for its iPhones and iPads, added Dawson, who said he doubts the company would want to sell a stand-alone camera unless it could be tied in with Apple\u2019s broader family of products and services.\n\nStill, the news seemed to make some GoPro investors nervous.\n\n\u201cAnytime Apple enters a market, it can be bad news for existing players,\u201d Dawson noted.\n\nGo Pro\u2019s shares ended down $6.91 to $49.87.\n\nApple shares gained 97 cents, or slightly less than 1 percent, closing at $110.22.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Apple has patented a new design for a digital video camera that could potentially compete with the rugged portable cameras made by GoPro, a move that sent GoPro's stock tumbling.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Apple has patented a new design for a digital video camera that could potentially compete with the rugged portable cameras made by GoPro, a move that sent GoPro\u2019s stock tumbling.", "title": "Apple camera patent could be better than GoPro", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/13/apple-camera-patent-could-be-better-than-gopro/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/13/ap428928581735.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/13/ap428928581735.jpg", "description": "Apple has patented a new design for a digital video camera that could potentially compete with the rugged portable cameras made by GoPro, a move that sent GoPro's stock tumbling.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Apple camera patent could be better than GoPro"}, "Author": "Brandon Bailey", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Business Finance, Technology Internet, Apple Inc, Gopro Inc"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce0d7\"", "article_summary": "GoPro shares dropped more than 12 percent on Tuesday after reports of the new patent surfaced on tech blogs and financial wires.\nApple shares gained 97 cents, or slightly less than 1 percent, closing at $110.22.\nBut as first reported by the blog \u201cPatently Apple,\u201d the company\u2019s application to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office says Apple\u2019s design improves on aspects of GoPro\u2019s camera.\nPatent office records show Apple first applied in 2012 for the patent, which was granted Tuesday.\nApple has not announced any plans for the patent, which covers a design for a remote-controlled, digital camera that can be attached to a helmet, surfboard or scuba mask."}
