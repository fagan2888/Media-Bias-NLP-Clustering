(Photo: The Tennessean)Buy Photo\n\nRespect the president\n\nI was shocked, surprised and concerned when I saw the picture you published Jan. 6 on the front page of President Obama.\n\nYour title was: \"Obama takes aim at gun sales.\"\n\nHis back is pictured and the blue USA Today dot on his back.\n\nI found it hard to believe that a professional newspaper would publish such an inflammatory picture of our President.\n\nWhat were you trying to tell your readers?\n\nShould they aim at the blue dot in support of guns?\n\nThis picture is disgraceful and a total disrespect to our president.\n\nThe Tennessean should report news in a neutral format and not indicate any partisan support.\n\nIt seems clear to me that your intent was to marginalize the president's position on gun control and placate to the NRA and overly conservative supporters against any common sense gun control.\n\nWhy picture the president's back and why place the USA Today logo on his back?\n\nMany of my acquaintances locally and outside the state of Tennessee also see similar concerns in this picture.\n\nIn the future it is my hope that The Tennessean will give more thought to its articles and gather broader review before publishing.\n\nAlso note that it should be, \"President Obama\" and not just \"Obama\" as you printed; he is the President of the United States and deserves the respect.\n\nJoseph Lewis, Brentwood 37027\n\nObama\u2019s backward leadership\n\nThe front page of the Jan. 6 Tennessean, \"Obama takes aim at gun sales,\" pictures Obama with his back to the reader.\n\nThat has been symbolically and literally his leadership style.\n\nHis \"back to us\" has been evidenced in handling border control, military strength and readiness, spending controls, health care effectiveness and logic, racial divide, fighting terrorism, consistently bypassing the legislative branch with executive orders on major issues, such as his latest action to stymie our rights to bear arms.\n\nTo initiate his warped idea of gun control he calls in his attorney general (note I didn't say \"our\" AG) to explore loopholes in the Constitution such that he can do an end run around congress.\n\nAnother technique he and his leftist buddies slyly inject to hamper our constitutional rights is to add excessive or complex regulations.\n\nAn anecdotal analogy recently coined explains Obama's logic: \"Gun control is like trying to reduce drunk driving by making it tougher for sober people to own cars.\"\n\nTwelve months and counting \u2014 I hope we can survive.\n\nMilt Herring, Old Hickory 37138\n\nCreating a target\n\nIf your purpose is to actively influence and impact a better quality of life in Middle Tennessee, you have totally missed the mark.\n\nYou have impacted our community for sure, but it won\u2019t have the impact you say you want.\n\nNot if you promote the shooting of our president the way you did in yesterday\u2019s paper.\n\nI hope you look at what you did soberly and promise me and all your readers to refrain from ever doing that again.\n\nYou put a target on the back of the president's head and then article after article poured out hatred toward him.\n\nIt couldn\u2019t be more plain. Do you remember Dallas Nov. 22, 1963? Do you remember the motel in Memphis and the balcony? How about the hotel in San Francisco the night of an election? It doesn\u2019t take much to have these situations.\n\nWhen I saw your paper I simply couldn\u2019t believe you would be so irresponsible. If you were not alive to remember these dates and places, I do. I remember President Reagan, George Wallace, President Truman, John Lennon, the list goes on. How could you be so callous!\n\nDixie Tanksley, Madison 37115\n\nRead or Share this story: http://tnne.ws/1Rhjqgg", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Readers sound off on Tennessean front page with back of Obama's head, both pro and con.", "og": {"site_name": "The Tennessean", "description": "Readers sound off on Tennessean front page with back of Obama's head, both pro and con.", "title": "Letters to the editor, Jan. 11: Obama front page", "url": "http://www.tennessean.com/story/opinion/readers/2016/01/11/letters-editor-obama-cover/78528884/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/tennessean.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Readers sound off on Tennessean front page with back of Obama's head, both pro and con.", "title": "Letters to the editor, Jan. 11: Obama front page", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/811dcdf1b95177d5c809551923b8364372e20cde/c=128-0-870-742&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/01/08/Nashville/B9320437247Z.1_20160108183432_000_G0FD3M3VB.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@tennessean", "site": "@tennessean", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600028886", "fb": {"app_id": 121487414583460}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Places/Hotels", "gci-categories": "Places/Hotels", "gci-asset-type": "Story", "title": "Letters to the editor, Jan. 11: Obama front page", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion/readers", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/40c262373d5e04e1ddd0a03c5da0eb7633b8fd3a/c=220-0-776-742/local/-/media/2016/01/08/Nashville/B9320437247Z.1_20160108183432_000_G0FD3M3VB.1-0.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/419b183bb43efe35d61fc82b4aa3d1a021096081/c=128-0-870-742/local/-/media/2016/01/08/Nashville/B9320437247Z.1_20160108183432_000_G0FD3M3VB.1-0.jpg", "contenttype": "Story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/475febb6ef93b705ab203380d3c74342dae0e243/c=4-0-993-742/local/-/media/2016/01/08/Nashville/B9320437247Z.1_20160108183432_000_G0FD3M3VB.1-0.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5103b7efca9860ac89dbc4518a3a21f66972c488/c=0-90-997-651&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2016/01/08/Nashville/B9320437247Z.1_20160108183432_000_G0FD3M3VB.1-0.jpg", "publishtime": "2016-01-10T23:01:30.670000-06:00", "shorthed": "Letters, Jan. 11: Obama front page", "articleid": 78528884, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9b585d3484dc38bb4e5c3a9399f1e7aee14363c6/c=0-90-997-651/local/-/media/2016/01/08/Nashville/B9320437247Z.1_20160108183432_000_G0FD3M3VB.1-0.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2bdeff165b6a34a2f18ecbf1046d7d36d823e671/c=290-0-707-742/local/-/media/2016/01/08/Nashville/B9320437247Z.1_20160108183432_000_G0FD3M3VB.1-0.jpg"}}}, "article_summary": "I remember President Reagan, George Wallace, President Truman, John Lennon, the list goes on.\nIt seems clear to me that your intent was to marginalize the president's position on gun control and placate to the NRA and overly conservative supporters against any common sense gun control.\n(Photo: The Tennessean)Buy PhotoRespect the presidentI was shocked, surprised and concerned when I saw the picture you published Jan. 6 on the front page of President Obama.\nAlso note that it should be, \"President Obama\" and not just \"Obama\" as you printed; he is the President of the United States and deserves the respect.\nJoseph Lewis, Brentwood 37027Obama\u2019s backward leadershipThe front page of the Jan. 6 Tennessean, \"Obama takes aim at gun sales,\" pictures Obama with his back to the reader."}
