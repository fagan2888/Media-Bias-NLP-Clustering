Ubl will succeed John Castellani, who announced his retirement from PhRMA earlier this year.\n\nBoth AdvaMed and PhRMA released statements Friday, giving credence to the rumors that Politico had published earlier in the week. Though a PhRMA spokesperson said that \u201ca decision [had] not yet been made,\u201d inside sources told Politico that the organization was waiting until member companies had been informed before making a formal announcement.\n\nVincent Forlenza, AdvaMed\u2019s board chairman, released a statement thanking Ubl for his 16 years of service and lauding his accomplishments as the leader of AdvaMed. Specifically, Forlenza credited Ubl with the formation of the AdvaMed Code of Ethics, his work to repeal the medical device tax, and the launch of a medical technology conference, AdvaMed 2015.\n\n\u201cDuring Steve\u2019s time at AdvaMed, the association experienced significant growth in membership, policy development capabilities as well as advocacy impact,\u201d said Forlenza in the statement. \u201cAs CEO, he created dedicated divisions to address the unique needs of the diagnostics industry and emerging growth of companies \u2014 AdvaMedDx and AdvaMed Accel, respectively.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times reported that the pharmaceutical industry is receiving a powerful lobbyist with \u201cshrewd political instincts and lowkey manner\u201d at a time when many top pharma companies are coming under fire over increasing drug prices.\n\n\u201cSteve\u2019s extensive experience, depth of knowledge and patient-centered approach to advocacy will serve him well in leading the association at a time when our industry is bringing tremendous medical innovation to patients, the healthcare system and society,\u201d stated Kenneth Frazier, chairman and CEO of Merck and board chairman of PhRMA.\n\nUbl said he\u2019s making the change during an exciting time in the biopharmaceutical industry and remarked that many life-saving innovations are poised to enter the market. \u201cI look forward to working with PhRMA member companies and the broader health care advocacy community to advance public policies that will improve patient\u2019s access to medicines and foster the continued development of new treatments and cures for patients,\u201d he said.\n\nPolitico reported that the post-Obamacare era in the healthcare industry has seen a shakeup in industry leadership positions. America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, The American Hospital Association, and the Generic Pharmaceutical Association have all experienced a changing of the guard. Additionally, earlier this month, National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) director Thomas Insel announced that he is joining the newly formed Google Life Sciences.\n\nIn his statement, Forlenza commented that one of Ubl\u2019s many strengths was his savvy for building and nurturing strong leadership. \u201cOver the years he has built a very strong team. The experience of Advamed\u2019s senior leadership team and AdvaMed\u2019s actively engaged Board of Directors leaves it well positioned to continue our important work.\u201d\n\nAccording to Forlenza, a nationwide search for Ubl\u2019s replacement is currently underway.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"description": "<p>After 16 years at the helm of the Advanced Medical Technology Association (AdvaMed), Stephen Ubl will be stepping down, effective Oct. 15, and taking over as president and CEO of Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA).
