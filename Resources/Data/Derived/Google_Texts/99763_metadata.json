Millions more went to The Gulf Coast Jewish Family Services Inc. in Pinellas County, Neighbor to Family in Volusia County, Sandy Pines Hospital in Palm Beach County and The Children\u2019s Home Inc. in Hillsborough. For many of those groups, it was the first time they received federal grant money.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services is required by law to care for unaccompanied immigrant children when there is no parent or legal guardian in the United States.\n\nThe federal grants are meant to cover costs for temporary housing, medical care and support services.\n\nBut details of exactly how the money is being spent haven\u2019t been easy to come by.\n\nSeveral, including Catholic Charities, referred questions to the Department of Justice saying \u201cAs determined by ORR\u2019s (Office of Refugee and Resettlement) policy, all media requests for any information regarding unaccompanied minors/programs et al in these facilities must be cleared by DOJ,\u201d spokeswoman Mary Ross Agosta said in an email.\n\nOthers didn\u2019t respond.\n\nMost of the money comes from the \u201cUnaccompanied Alien Children Program,\u201d a program managed by the Department of Health and Human Services, Administration for Children and Families and the Office of Refugee Resettlement.\n\nThe Office of Management and Budget, said this fiscal year\u2019s budget is $1.4 billion, and next year\u2019s is $2.28 billion.\n\nRead More on Watchdog.org.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Charities Received Over $20M to Shelter Border Kids", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Charities Received Over $20M to Shelter Border Kids", "title": "Charities Taking Care of Unaccompanied Minors Getting Significant Federal Grants", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/10428472_10152652026184000_4560678044727803783_n.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-09-19T15:57:03+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1wOo235"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Charities Received Over $20M to Shelter Border Kids", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/10428472_10152652026184000_4560678044727803783_n.jpg"}, "title": "Charities Taking Care of Unaccompanied Minors Getting Significant Federal Grants", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "immigration", "published_time": "2014-09-21T03:01:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-19T15:57:03+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "border crisis, border children, immigration, illegal immigration, border kids shelter"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0060\"", "article_summary": "Catholics Charities of the Archdiocese of Miami received more than $4.3 million to care for 300 border children.\nThe federal grants are meant to cover costs for temporary housing, medical care and support services.\nThe Department of Health and Human Services is required by law to care for unaccompanied immigrant children when there is no parent or legal guardian in the United States.\nHis House Children\u2019s Home in Miami, a nonprofit providing residential care for abused, abandoned and neglected children, received about $10 million, nearly double what it got last year.\nThe Office of Management and Budget, said this fiscal year\u2019s budget is $1.4 billion, and next year\u2019s is $2.28 billion."}
