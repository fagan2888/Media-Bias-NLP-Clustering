The corner of Jackson and Meeting Street in downtown Charleston could have easily been mistaken for a shopping mall.

Saturday, volunteers from Without Walls Ministry, along with District 111 Representative Wendell Gilliard, gave away hundreds of free clothing items to area residents.

The annual event also featured warm food and non-perishable items for anyone in need.

"It's a little heartbreaking to see the need out here," said Pastor Gordon Cashwell of Without Walls Ministry.

"I'm just hoping that as churches and community leaders that we can really pitch in together to meet needs and do more this year."

The event started 16 years ago as a coat give-away. Saturday, community members walked away with bags filled with clothes and food.

"Every time you see a smile on these young people's face, you look at the veterans, you look at the people who are homeless, it makes you feel warm," said Rep. Gilliard.

"You can't put a price on that."
