Fresh from her appearance on Wednesday night's episode of "Empire," Mary J. Blige stars in the new music video for "Doubt," an uplifting cut from last year's "The London Sessions."

It finds Blige working hard as usual, emoting her head off as she sings about making it to the top -- but not without nearly paying the cost and sacrificing a lot.

Among the things she appears to have sacrificed? An audience, which for most of the clip is nowhere to be seen as Blige pours out her troubles to an empty theater.

A crowd does materialize near the end, but by that point the message is clear: Mary J. Blige brings it even when there's no one to watch it being brought.
