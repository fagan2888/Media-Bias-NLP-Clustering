Even after his campaign made news in Iowa, the Wisconsin governor remained the far-and-away leader in the Centennial State, according to an overnight flash poll conducted by VoterGravity.com.\n\nOne-third of Coloradans in this survey picked Walker. That\u2019s better than double the support for second place Jeb Bush. The former Florida governor, busy raising campaign cash for his PAC, earned 14 percent support. Dr. Ben Carson was right behind, at 12 percent.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nThe survey is comprehensive. It includes only people who are extremely likely voters \u2014 those who\u2019ve cast ballots in each of the last four Colorado Republican primaries. It also involves an unusually large sample size, with more than 8,200 respondents.\n\nThere\u2019s also room for change. Some 12 percent support \u201cother,\u201d indicating they\u2019re available if a better candidate can make a solid case.\n\n\u201cOur newest flash poll in Colorado only re-enforces the trends we\u2019ve been seeing in our previous polls,\u201d Ned Ryun, CEO of Voter Gravity, says. \u201cScott Walker continues to perform very strongly with the GOP primary base, whether it\u2019s in the south or out west.\u201d\n\nSitting senators didn\u2019t do well in Colorado. Marco Rubio (7 percent), Rand Paul (6 percent) and Ted Cruz (4 percent) were near the bottom of the Voter Gravity survey. That could be bad news for Sen. Michael Bennet, a Democrat who\u2019ll be seeking re-election in 2016. Coloradans replaced Dem. Sen. Mark Udall with Republican Cory Gardner last year.\n\n\u201cI do think this also highlights what other polls are also showing: Rubio, Paul and Cruz have some work to do if they are going to elevate themselves to Tier 1 candidates,\u201d Ryun says. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s really dawned on people yet that really by next year at this time, March of 2016, we\u2019ll have already had over 20 GOP primaries and caucuses with over 50 percent of the delegates decided.\u201d\n\nSeveral high-profile candidates are expected to officially announce their bids next month. Meanwhile, Voter Gravity plans to release a new tracking poll each week or so.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Exclusive - VoterGravity.com Flash Poll: Walker Way Ahead in Colorado", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Exclusive - VoterGravity.com Flash Poll: Walker Way Ahead in Colorado", "title": "Gov.
