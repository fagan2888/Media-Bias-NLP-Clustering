At the time, Littlejohn was an intellectual property lawyer working in San Francisco. She abandoned that work to found and promote Women\u2019s Rights Without Frontiers.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to end coercive population control,\u201d Littlejohn says. \u201cChina is unique in the sense that it will be government officials tracking women\u2019s menstrual cycles, giving them cervical checks, and, if they\u2019re illegally pregnant, dragging them out for forced abortions.\u201d\n\nLittlejohn herself met with three women who underwent such forced abortions, later testifying before the U.S. Congress and European Parliament. She has also briefed officials at the White House, U.S. Department of State, United Nations, and Vatican on the increasingly dire situation that she calls \u201cgendercide.\u201d\n\nHer \u201cSave a Girl\u201d campaign has, through volunteers in China who both encourage women not to abort female babies and provide help to those being pressured by the government, saved the lives of roughly 200 Chinese infants.\n\nWhile China formally denies that procedures like forced abortion take place, expert Olivia Enos cites reports from refugees and aid workers on the ground in China as evidence of human rights abuses.\n\n\u201cIndividuals are targeted, and their whole families are targeted [based on this policy],\u201d says Enos, a research associate with The Heritage Foundation\u2019s Asian Studies Center. \u201cThey\u2019re blackmailed and threatened with imprisonment if they don\u2019t abort their children.\u201d\n\nEnos adds that the social and financial ramifications of being in violation of the one-child policy, enacted according to a quota system, can also be devastating.\n\n\u201c[China] has engineered a social structure where individuals that have a child, even if it\u2019s their first child, if they haven\u2019t received a birth quota from the government, the population control police will come after them,\u201d Enos says.\n\nLittlejohn is currently focusing on disproving the myth that a Chinese decision to alter the country\u2019s family policy to a universal two-child rule would translate to protection for women and children.\n\n\u201cI believe that because of the demographic disaster they are facing, they will probably move to a two-child policy pretty soon,\u201d Littlejohn says. \u201cThat will not end forced abortion in China. The core of the policy is not whether China allows a woman to have one child or two children. The core of the policy is the fact that the government is telling women how many children they can have and enforcing that limit through forced abortion, forced sterilization, and forced contraception.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Reggie Littlejohn is the president of Women's Rights Without Frontiers, an organization dedicated to ending forced abortions in China.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Reggie Littlejohn is the president of Women's Rights Without Frontiers, an organization dedicated to ending forced abortions in China.", "title": "Yale Law Grad Abandoned Her Career to Help Save 200 Chinese Babies", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Reggie.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-10-20T16:41:26+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1jS4HKn"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Reggie Littlejohn is the president of Women's Rights Without Frontiers, an organization dedicated to ending forced abortions in China.", "title": "Yale Law Grad Abandoned Her Career to Help Save 200 Chinese Babies", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Reggie.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "International", "tag": "Asia", "published_time": "2015-10-20T15:58:37+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-20T16:41:26+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "One-child policy, China, forced abortion, forced sterilization, Reggie Littlejohn, Women\u2019s Rights Without Frontiers"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdf7c\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThat will not end forced abortion in China.\nThe core of the policy is not whether China allows a woman to have one child or two children.\nThe core of the policy is the fact that the government is telling women how many children they can have and enforcing that limit through forced abortion, forced sterilization, and forced contraception.\u201d\nLittlejohn, a graduate of Yale Law School, first became aware of these practices during a pro bono representation of a Chinese refugee who had been forcibly sterilized.\nOn Oct. 11, Littlejohn observed the third anniversary of a campaign her organization, Women\u2019s Rights Without Frontiers, launched to protect women and female children from that same Chinese policy, notably through the \u201cSave a Girl\u201d campaign."}
