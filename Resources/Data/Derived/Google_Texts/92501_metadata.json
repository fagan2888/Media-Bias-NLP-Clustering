After all, if the latter was true, then why would a stalwart immigration patriot like Sessions not endorse Cruz?\n\nThe answer is that Cruz was not amnesty\u2019s chief nemesis.\n\nIt is true that Cruz did not support making America\u2019s 12 million or so illegal immigrants citizens. At the very least, he didn\u2019t support doing so immediately. He did, however, advocate on behalf of granting them legal status\u2014the first step to citizenship.\n\nCruz now denies that he ever promoted this position. While he concedes that he did indeed argue for legalization while reckoning with the Gang of Eight, he now claims that this was just a maneuver designed to doom the amnesty bill to defeat.\n\nHispanic Republicans who have known and worked closely with Cruz for years insist that they know better.\n\nRobert De Posada, a former Director of Hispanic Affairs for the RNC and the founder of the \u201cLatino Coalition,\u201d a \u201cconservative\u201d organization, is adamant: \u201cIt\u2019s just a flat out lie. Period.\u201d He continued: \u201cThere\u2019s just no truth behind it.\u201d\n\nDe Posada, who worked (unsuccessfully) with George W. Bush\u2019s administration to pass \u201ccomprehensive immigration reform,\u201d conceded that while Cruz may have changed his mind on this issue over the years, it is simply not true that he never favored legalization. \u201cBut don\u2019t sit here and flat out lie that you have never been for legalization when the facts are very clear.\u201d\n\nAnd what are the facts? The facts are that Cruz distinguished himself as among the most talented and aggressive of lawyers in the army of attorneys that Bush had assembled to craft his pro-immigration policies. All such policies included, at the very least, legalization\u2014the first step on the path to citizenship.\n\nIn the early 2000s, Cruz joined the board of HAPI, an organization of \u201cconservative\u201d Hispanics that passionately argued on behalf of legalization. According to The Daily Beast, the group endorsed and labored to have implemented in law both \u201cPresident Bush\u2019s principles for immigration reform\u201d and even the McCain-Kennedy immigration \u201creform act\u201d of 2006!\n\nBack in 2013, Mickey Kaus, writing in The Daily Caller, remarked that ifRubio and the Gang of Eight have its way, if amnesty passes, he knows who he will blame: Ted Cruz.\n\n\u201cCruz was the national politician best positioned to stop the bipartisan, MSM-backed push for \u2018legalization first.\u2019 He not only failed to rise to the occasion, he\u2019s recently increased its chance of becoming law.\u201d\n\nKaus leveled a \u201ctwo-count indictment\u201d against the Texas senator:\n\nFirst, while he would\u2019ve ideally been \u201cin the press and on the Senate floor, day after day, making the case against the \u2018Gang of 8\u2019 con job even if it risked costing him some MSM and donor support,\u201d instead Cruz \u201ccontributed the minimum necessary to maintain his credibility as a foe of the Gang of 8 [.]\u201d\n\nCruz promoted an online petition, made a Senate floor presentation, and gave some speeches to black marchers and Tea Partiers, it\u2019s true. But \u201cthe job of actually leading the opposition, day in and out, fell to Jeff Sessions [.]\u201d\n\nSessions was \u201corganized, forceful and logical,\u201d and yet he failed to \u201cbring the PR heft to the fight that Cruz could.\u201d\n\nSecond, Cruz exploited the August recess period, the time when the grassroots could attend town halls and register their outrage with the Gang of Eight\u2019s designs, by talking about, not amnesty, but the defunding of Obamacare!\n\n\u201cInto this void stepped Cruz, who made a bold attempt to rouse a \u2018grassroots army\u2019 for the cause of\u2026defunding Obamacare. So instead of haranguing their members about unchecked immigration, hard core red-staters would harangue them about the Democrats\u2019 health care plans.\u201d\n\nKaus concluded: \u201cAlmost certainly both these moves have helped Cruz\u2019s presidential ambitions,\u201d for \u201cBig GOP Donors, who almost unanimously favor amnesty, are sophisticated enough to know the difference between fighting 100% against it and going through the motions.\u201d\n\nVoters at this time, Kaus notes, were galvanized by Cruz\u2019s fight to defund Obamacare. They were never galvanized by Cruz\u2019s big fight to stop amnesty and illegal immigration\u2014because there was no such fight on Cruz\u2019s part.\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder that Cruz\u2019s heart was never in that fight. He labored tirelessly for years with an eye toward enabling illegal immigrants to remain in the country (to say nothing of dramatically increasing the number of legal immigrants).\n\nAnd legalization, as any fool should be able to recognize, is but amnesty by a different name, for legalization forgives the crime of invading America and provides the first steps toward citizenship.\n\nRobert De Posada, Cruz\u2019s old colleague, remarked: \u201cWhen he went so far as to say that he\u2019s never been for legalizing, that\u2019s where he crossed the line and lost people like me.\u201d De Posada elaborates: \u201cIt\u2019s a character issue where a lot of us are just like, \u2018Um, no.\u2019\u201d\n\nPerhaps Senator Sessions, who had never before endorsed a presidential candidate and who laments that for thirty years he never encountered a politician who has followed through with the promise to \u201cfix\u201d the problem of illegal immigration, has about as much faith in Cruz\u2019s credibility on this issue as does De Posada.", "article_metadata": {"description": "When Marco Rubio and his fellow seven gangsters in the Gang of Eight tried to impose amnesty upon the country, Senator Jeff Sessions spearheaded the battle against it..05/27/2016 8:46:57AM EST.", "author": "Jack Kerwick", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "When Marco Rubio and his fellow seven gangsters in the Gang of Eight tried to impose amnesty upon the country, Senator Jeff Sessions spearheaded the battle against it.", "title": "Jack Kerwick - Why Sessions Did Not Endorse Ted Cruz: The Latter Favored \u2018Amnesty\u2019", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/jackkerwick/2016/02/29/why-sessions-did-not-endorse-ted-cruz-the-latter-favored-amnesty-n2126573", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/57/e435b95b-c2b3-4543-810b-161164409647.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "When Marco Rubio and his fellow seven gangsters in the Gang of Eight tried to impose amnesty upon the country, Senator Jeff Sessions spearheaded the battle against it.", "title": "Jack Kerwick - Why Sessions Did Not Endorse Ted Cruz: The Latter Favored \u2018Amnesty\u2019", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/jackkerwick/2016/02/29/why-sessions-did-not-endorse-ted-cruz-the-latter-favored-amnesty-n2126573", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/57/e435b95b-c2b3-4543-810b-161164409647.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Why Sessions Did Not Endorse Ted Cruz: The Latter Favored \u2018Amnesty\u2019, Jack Kerwick, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "After all, if the latter was true, then why would a stalwart immigration patriot like Sessions not endorse Cruz?\nThey were never galvanized by Cruz\u2019s big fight to stop amnesty and illegal immigration\u2014because there was no such fight on Cruz\u2019s part.\nIn addition to sucking from his sails whatever wind Rubio and his backers thought he had, Sessions\u2019 endorsement of Trump also deals a huge blow to Ted Cruz, Sessions\u2019 colleague in the senate who has been styling himself as the Gang of Eight\u2019s chief nemesis.\nIt is true that Cruz did not support making America\u2019s 12 million or so illegal immigrants citizens.\nWhen Marco Rubio and his fellow seven gangsters in the Gang of Eight tried to impose amnesty upon the country, Senator Jeff Sessions spearheaded the battle against it."}
