If you want to consider yourself health-conscious and forward-thinking, you probably think you should go ahead and assume that they\u2019re bad. Most people do this, but the fact is, the debate about GMOs is complicated and difficult to decipher. The verdict is still out on whether or not they\u2019re damaging to human health, though they may have the potential to carry health risks.\n\nUnless you\u2019ve done your homework on GMOs, you might belong to the majority of people who assume that anything containing GMOs is vaguely \u201cbad for you,\u201d while being unsure of what exactly it stands for. In a new segment, Jimmy Kimmel does some man-on-the-street interviews to prove his point: most people don\u2019t know anything about GMOs. The people he interviews at a local farmers market are asked what GMO stands for, and they\u2019re unable to tell him \u2014 they still assume they\u2019re bad for you.\n\nGMO stands for genetically modified organism. Genetic engineering allows scientists to introduce genes from one species into another species in order to improve agriculture or pharmaceutical products; according to Nature, \u201c[c]rop plants, farm animals, and soil bacteria are some of the more prominent examples of organisms that have been subject to genetic engineering.\u201d So, if they\u2019re possibly bad for us, why do farmers use GMOs? The fact is, inserting new genes into a crop like corn or soybeans can protect them from destructive environmental factors like drought or frost, or pests and diseases; and it allows farmers to plant larger quantities of food for much cheaper. Proponents of GMOs cite food security and even a positive impact in developing countries, where food sources are scarce.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t sound so bad. So why are activists up in arms about it? While studies show ambivalent results, and further research will need to be done, it\u2019s currently more about the implication or potential of GMOs to carry health risks. Though genes being transferred from one species to another often happens naturally, doing it through gene expression has unknown effects. \u201cAfter all, such alterations can change the organism\u2019s metabolism, growth rate, and/or response to external environmental factors,\u201d Nature writes. \u201cThese consequences influence not only the GMO itself, but also the natural environment in which that organism is allowed to proliferate. Potential health risks to humans include the possibility of exposure to new allergens in genetically modified foods, as well as the transfer of antibiotic-resistant genes to gut flora.\u201d Activists also argue that GMOs may ultimately have a negative impact on the economy and environment overall.\n\nSome studies have pointed to potential health risks of GMOs, while others dispute them, noting that any risk from GMOs is extremely low. However, if you\u2019re going to avoid GMO products at the supermarket, it\u2019s best to do your homework. Or you could be like the one guy Jimmy Kimmel interviewed, who takes an indifferent approach: \u201cI don\u2019t know, so I really don\u2019t care,\u201d the laissez-faire man answers in the video. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t affect me, I\u2019m not sick, I\u2019m fine.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "genetically modified organism, gmos, jimmy kimmel", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "GMOs may or may not pose health risks, but most people don\u2019t even know what the acronym stands for.", "title": "People Against GMOs Most Likely Have No Idea What They Are [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/jimmy-kimmel-shows-most-people-think-gmos-are-bad-yet-they-have-no-idea-what-they-are-306809", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/11/gmos.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "GMOs may or may not pose health risks, but most people don\u2019t even know what the acronym stands for.", "title": "People Against GMOs Most Likely Have No Idea What They Are [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/jimmy-kimmel-shows-most-people-think-gmos-are-bad-yet-they-have-no-idea-what-they-are-306809", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/11/gmos.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/11/gmos.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-10-11T13:48:45-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-11T13:48:44-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "GMOs may or may not pose health risks, but most people don\u2019t even know what the acronym stands for."}, "article_summary": "If you want to consider yourself health-conscious and forward-thinking, you probably think you should go ahead and assume that they\u2019re bad.\nSome studies have pointed to potential health risks of GMOs, while others dispute them, noting that any risk from GMOs is extremely low.\nThe people he interviews at a local farmers market are asked what GMO stands for, and they\u2019re unable to tell him \u2014 they still assume they\u2019re bad for you.\nIn a new segment, Jimmy Kimmel does some man-on-the-street interviews to prove his point: most people don\u2019t know anything about GMOs.\nThe verdict is still out on whether or not they\u2019re damaging to human health, though they may have the potential to carry health risks."}
