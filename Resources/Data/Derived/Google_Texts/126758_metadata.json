They found that overweight and obese children were less likely to be thought of as overweight in the latter set, compared with children of a similar weight in the former set.\n\nSome say this trend could be because obesity has become somewhat of a cultural norm. In the UK website The Conversation, health psychologist Jane Ogden writes:\n\nFat children may be invisible to their parents not only because the weight gain has been gradual but because their point of reference has changed. The term \u201cobesity\u201d not only means excess body weight but it also implies disease, illness, difference and a \u201cproblem.\u201d Since the prevalence of obesity has increased dramatically over the past 40 years, and as populations get fatter, the new normal has become overweight and therefore invisible. By comparison, fatter children are now thin. And as seats on aeroplanes, buses or in stadiums get wider and clothes get bigger, being obese is no longer a problem, particularly for children who may only experience symptoms in their later years. So if nearly everyone is obese then bizarrely no one is.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obesity has more than doubled in children and quadrupled in adolescents in the past 30 years, according to the CDC", "author": "Joanna Rothkopf", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Obesity has more than doubled in children and quadrupled in adolescents in the past 30 years, according to the CDC", "title": "Many parents can\u2019t tell if their child is obese or not", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/08/29/many_parents_cant_tell_if_their_child_is_obese_or_not/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2010/04/eight_early_childhood_factors_that_may_drive_life_long_obesity.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Obesity has more than doubled in children and quadrupled in adolescents in the past 30 years, according to the CDC", "creator": "@@joannarothkopf", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2010/04/eight_early_childhood_factors_that_may_drive_life_long_obesity.jpg", "title": "Many parents can\u2019t tell if their child is obese or not", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Many parents can\u2019t tell if their child is obese or not", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Childhood obesity, Health, Parenting", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4487\"", "article_summary": "Researchers asked parents (mainly mothers) whether their child aged 6-11 was overweight, underweight or about the right weight in two periods: one group was asked from 1988-1994, and the other from 2005-2010.\nThey found that overweight and obese children were less likely to be thought of as overweight in the latter set, compared with children of a similar weight in the former set.\nSo if nearly everyone is obese then bizarrely no one is.\nSome say this trend could be because obesity has become somewhat of a cultural norm.\nAnd as seats on aeroplanes, buses or in stadiums get wider and clothes get bigger, being obese is no longer a problem, particularly for children who may only experience symptoms in their later years."}
