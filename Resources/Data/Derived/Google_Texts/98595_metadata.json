(REUTERS/Mike Segar)\n\n4865262\n\nA Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs chairman wants the federal government to disclose how much money taxpayers lost because of the rapid-fire financial collapse of 12 Obamacare health insurance co-ops, The Daily Caller News Foundation has learned.\n\nSen. Ron Johnson demanded in a Jan. 19 letter to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) that federal officials provide full accounting for the losses. A part of the Department of Health an Human Services, CMS oversees the experimental co-op program.\n\n\u201cThe number of failed CO-OPs and the anticipation of additional closures raise concerns about how CMS will recoup the $2.4 billion it loaned to the 23 CO-OPs,\u201d Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican, told CMS Andy Slavitt, the acting CMS administrator.\n\nJohnson\u2019s letter is an indication the oversight committee is preparing to wade into the $2.4 billion co-op debacle.\n\nAt least half of the funds awarded to 23 experimental health insurance co-ops since 2012 have been lost to date.\n\nThe co-ops were devised by the Obama administration to provide tax-funded non-profit competition to for-profit private commercial health insurance companies. Many of the co-ops were led by inexperienced activists or those with close political ties to the Obama administration.\n\nAll but one of the 23 operating co-ops suffered large net operating losses and 12 ultimately closed their doors last year. A 24th co-op in Vermont was never licensed.\n\nThe co-op failures forced more than 450,000 health insurance customers to scramble last year to find new coverage.\n\nMaine, the sole co-op that last year reported a positive balance sheet, announced in early December it would no longer sell insurance policies in 2016.\n\nThe failed co-ops are supposed to \u201cforfeit all unused loan funds\u201d with interest within 60 days of state liquidation, according to federal law.\n\nJohnson doubts, however, that any funds will be repaid and he slammed CMS for its lack of openness and transparency about the co-op failures.\n\n\u201cCMS\u2019s oversight of the troubled co-op plan has been plagued by a fundamental lack of transparency with the American public and Congress,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nIt\u2019s also possible the 2015 run of co-op defaults may not have ended. As previously reported by TheDCNF, at least 11 surviving co-ops are under \u201cenhanced oversight\u201d by CMS because of poor enrollment and are facing significant operating losses.\n\n\u201cCMS has reportedly placed 11 operational CO-OPs on an \u2018enhanced oversight\u2019 list, but has declined to disclose which CO-OPs it placed on the list or its rationale for doing so,\u201d Johnson noted in his letter.\n\nSlavitt, the CMS acting administrator, has been tainted by ethics charges and allegations of conflicts of interest. He was nominated by President Barack Obama to succeed former CMS Administrator Marilyn Tavenner who resigned after the November 2013 Obamacare launch failure.\n\nSlavitt was given a rare \u201cethics waiver\u201d when he joined CMS, which permitted him to rule on regulations that could affect his previous employer, United Health Group (UHG).\n\nUHG is the largest health insurance company in the country and generates a third of its revenues from the federal government, primarily from CMS.\n\nJohnson asked for original copies of the co-op loan agreements and the standards used by CMS and its accounting consultant, Milliman, to approve co-op applicants.\n\nJohnson demanded a CMS response by Feb. 2, but CMS has been chronically slow to respond to congressional requests for Obamacare information and documents since the program\u2019s inception in 2011.\n\nA CMS spokesman declined to comment.\n\nFollow Richard on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
