The film, Deadline Hollywood reports, will be entitled On The Basis of Sex.\n\nThe film will arrive not long after Justice Ginsburg emerged as a pop cultural icon, inspiring t-shirts with slogans ranging from \u201cNotorious R.B.G.\u201d to \u201cRuth Badass Ginsburg.\u201d A book entitled Notorious RBG: The Life and Times of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, is due out this October.\n\nGinsburg\u2019s rise as a cultural icon, however, lags many of her greatest contributions to American law by four decades. In 1971, while still a practicing attorney, Ginsburg authored the brief in Reed v. Reed that convinced the Supreme Court to hold unanimously and for the first time that the Constitution\u2019s promise of equal protection of the laws applies to women. Five years later, Ginsburg\u2019s brief in Craig v. Boren convinced the Court to hold that all laws that engage in gender discrimination should be treated with skepticism under the Constitution.\n\nYet, as Slate\u2019s Dahlia Lithwick notes, Ginsburg\u2019s rise as a pop cultural icon comes at the very moment when many of the advances she secured as a lawyer seem most in jeopardy. Ginsburg\u2019s dissent in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby was set to music, for example, but Ginsburg still dissented in Hobby Lobby \u2014 while five male justices gave many women\u2019s bosses an unprecedented degree of influence over whether those women may use birth control.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Ginsburg's rise as a pop cultural icon comes at the very moment when many of the advances she secured as a lawyer seem most in jeopardy.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Ginsburg's rise as a pop cultural icon comes at the very moment when many of the advances she secured as a lawyer seem most in jeopardy.", "title": "There\u2019s Going To Be A Ruth Bader Ginsburg Movie Starring Natalie Portman", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2015/05/10/3657156/theres-going-ruth-bader-ginsburg-movie-starring-natalie-portman/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/ginsburg-yale-e1377898024599.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ginsburg's rise as a pop cultural icon comes at the very moment when many of the advances she secured as a lawyer seem most in jeopardy.", "creator": "@imillhiser", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/ginsburg-yale-e1377898024599.jpg", "title": "There\u2019s Going To Be A Ruth Bader Ginsburg Movie Starring Natalie Portman", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-justice", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/ginsburg-yale-e1377898024599.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/ginsburg-yale-e1377898024599.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-10T11:16:04+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/IanMillhiserPublic"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe138b\"", "article_summary": "Justice There\u2019s Going To Be A Ruth Bader Ginsburg Movie Starring Natalie Portman CREDIT: Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg (Credit: AP)Natalie Portman will play Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in a film chronicling Ginsburg\u2019s fight for equal rights for women under the law.\nGinsburg\u2019s rise as a cultural icon, however, lags many of her greatest contributions to American law by four decades.\nThe film will arrive not long after Justice Ginsburg emerged as a pop cultural icon, inspiring t-shirts with slogans ranging from \u201cNotorious R.B.G.\u201d to \u201cRuth Badass Ginsburg.\u201d A book entitled Notorious RBG: The Life and Times of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, is due out this October.\nYet, as Slate\u2019s Dahlia Lithwick notes, Ginsburg\u2019s rise as a pop cultural icon comes at the very moment when many of the advances she secured as a lawyer seem most in jeopardy.\nThe film, Deadline Hollywood reports, will be entitled On The Basis of Sex."}
