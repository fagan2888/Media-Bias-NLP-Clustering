Having \u201creformed\u201d U.S. medicine, Obama now aims to \u201crepair\u201d the World Wide Web. If you like Obamacare, you will love ObamaNet.\n\nOn February 26, the Federal Communications Commission will vote on a \u201cnet neutrality\u201d proposal to regulate broadband networks as if they were telephone monopolies from the days when copper wire was high tech. ObamaNet would let Uncle Sam intervene in the price, product-innovation, and capacity decisions of Internet Service Providers (ISPs).\n\nNet neutrality? Let\u2019s call it net brutality.\n\nLike Obamacare, ObamaNet would impose complex rules via Title II of the Communications Act of 1934. FDR signed that legislation seven years after The Jazz Singer \u2014 the first feature-length talking picture \u2014 and seven years before Pearl Harbor. Astride this 81-year-old steed, Obama would lead the Internet\u2019s charge into the 21st century.\n\nOnce ObamaNet ropes ISPs into Title II, they would need FCC approval for new products, business models, data-traffic operations, and more.

They could ask \u201cforbearance\u201d from these regulations. Good luck. According to the National Cable & Telecommunications Association, the FCC makes the average applicant wait 372 days \u2014 one year and one week \u2014 for an answer.

ISPs then would \u201cpass them on to you, the consumer.\u201d\n\nLiberal-think-tank scholars Robert Litan of the Brookings Institution and Hal Singer of the Progressive Policy Institute (PPI) calculate annual increases in state fees of $67 for landline-broadband accounts and $72 for wireless subscriptions. Federal taxes per household will rise $17. They predict that \u201cthe new fees could reach $15 billion per year.\u201d\n\nWhy does Obama want to squeeze $156 annually out of each typical broadband customer? What agony would ObamaNet assuage?\n\nGive Obama this: Though unaffordable, gargantuan, and tyrannical, Obamacare does address a legitimate challenge: Insuring Americans who lack health coverage. The need for a lower-cost, pro-patient replacement remains vital; yet Obamacare \u2014 despite countless flaws \u2014 at least attempts to answer a real-life problem that vexes millions of Americans.\n\nOne cannot say this about ObamaNet.\n\nIs any American so inclined unable to go online? Cheap computers with built-in browsers grant instant access to the Internet\u2019s treasures. If one cannot buy an Internet-capable computer or smartphone, federally subsidized libraries offer free gateways to Amazon, eBay, Hotmail, Wikipedia, YouTube, and virtually every recorded example of human wisdom and folly via Google.\n\nObama claims that evil ISPs are delaying faster connections and denying consumers access to their speediest networks. \u201cYou\u2019re watching the loading icon spin,\u201d Obama complained on January 14 in Cedar Falls, Iowa. \u201cYou\u2019re waiting, and waiting, and waiting.
