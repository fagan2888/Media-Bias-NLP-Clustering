He\u2019s a whirlwind of energy. And man oh man can he give a presentation. On any subject, he\u2019s informed, inflamed, precise.\n\nBut then you talk with people who\u2019ve worked with him at various stages of his career. They dislike him.\n\nNo, scratch that.\n\nThey loathe him.\n\nThey grant him all of the virtues that you\u2019ve observed, but tell you that he\u2019s the antithesis of a team player. His thirst for the spotlight is unquenchable. His arrogance is unalloyed. He actually takes pride in being abrasive, as if a person\u2019s tally of detractors measures his fearlessness, not his obnoxiousness.\n\nDo you hire this applicant?\n\nNo way.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why voters should be wary \u2014 very wary \u2014 of Ted Cruz.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe\u2019s surging. I warned you about this. In a poll of Republicans in Iowa last week, he was in a statistical tie with Donald Trump for the lead.\n\nMore and more Republican insiders talk about a battle between Cruz and Marco Rubio for the nomination, or about a three-way, if you will, among Cruz, Rubio and Trump.\n\nAnd in the voices of these insiders I hear horror, because Trump and Cruz are nasty pieces of work.\n\nCruz will work overtime in the months ahead to persuade you otherwise. The religious right already adores him, but to go the distance, he needs more support from other, less conservative Republicans, and he knows it. Expect orchestrated glimpses of a high-minded Cruz, less skunk than statesman, his sneer ceding territory to a smile.\n\nYou saw this in recent debates. He chided moderators for meanspirited questions. He bemoaned the pitting of one Republican against another. The audacity of those complaints was awe-inspiring: Cruz rose to national prominence with gratuitous, overwrought tirades against fellow party members and with a complete lack of deference to elders in the Senate, which he entered in January 2013, at age 42.\n\nHe likened Senate Republicans who recognized the impossibility of defunding Obamacare to Nazi appeasers. They took note.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cAs Cruz gains, GOP senators rally for Rubio\u201d said the headline of a story this week in Politico, which explained: \u201cThe idea of Cruz as the nominee is enough to send shudders down the spines of most Senate Republicans.\u201d Support for Rubio is the flower of anyone-but-Cruz dread.\n\nAnyone but Cruz: That\u2019s the leitmotif of his life, stretching back to college at Princeton. His freshman roommate, Craig Mazin, told Patricia Murphy of The Daily Beast: \u201cI would rather have anybody else be the president of the United States. Anyone. I would rather pick somebody from the phone book.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not easy to come across on-the-record quotes like that, and Mazin\u2019s words suggest a disdain that transcends ideology. They bear heeding.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSo does Cruz\u2019s experience in the policy shop of George W. Bush\u2019s 2000 presidential campaign. After Bush took office, other full-time advisers got plum jobs in the White House. Cruz was sent packing to the Siberia of the Federal Trade Commission.\n\nThe political strategist Matthew Dowd, who worked for Bush back then, tweeted that \u201cif truth serum was given to the staff of the 2000 Bush campaign,\u201d an enormous percentage of them \u201cwould vote for Trump over Cruz.\u201d\n\nAnother Bush 2000 alumnus said to me: \u201cWhy do people take such an instant dislike to Ted Cruz? It just saves time.\u201d\n\nHis three signature moments in the Senate have been a florid smearing of Chuck Hagel with no achievable purpose other than attention for Ted Cruz, a flamboyant rebellion against Obamacare with no achievable purpose other than attention for Ted Cruz, and a fiery protest of federal funding for Planned Parenthood with no achievable purpose other than attention for Ted Cruz. Notice any pattern?\n\nAsked about Cruz at a fund-raiser last spring, John Boehner responded by raising a lone finger \u2014 the middle one.\n\nMore recently, Senate Republicans denied Cruz a procedural courtesy that\u2019s typically pro forma.\n\n\u201cThat is different than anything I\u2019ve ever seen in my years here,\u201d Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican, told The Washington Post.\n\nMany politicians rankle peers. Many have detractors. Cruz generates antipathy of an entirely different magnitude. It\u2019s so pronounced and so pervasive that he\u2019s been forced to acknowledge it, and he spins it as the price invariably paid by an outsider who challenges the status quo, clings to principle and never backs down.\n\nNo, it\u2019s the fruit of a combative style and consuming solipsism that would make him an insufferable, unendurable president. And if there\u2019s any sense left in this election and mercy in this world, it will undo him soon enough.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20151202032119, "twitter": {"description": "The strident Texas senator wants the ultimate promotion.
