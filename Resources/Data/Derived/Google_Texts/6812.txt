One local church organized a new and unique ministry.

Agape Storehouse held a drive-thru prayer breakfast Saturday morning. Individuals were given free breakfast along with prayer if wanted.

The ministry allows the church and its members to become more visible in the community. Terriana Easley says it is a way to help needs in this community.

"We know that we have needs and we are here to meet their needs," Easley says. "Not just physically but also spiritually."

The event was held from 8 a.m. to 10 a.m. Saturday morning.
