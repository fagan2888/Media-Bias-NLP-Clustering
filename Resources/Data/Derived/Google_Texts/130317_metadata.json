But we do have a pathway when(!) a pro-life president is elected.\u201d\n\nShowing that pathway is the purpose of the House vote, tentatively scheduled for next Wednesday, on a so-called budget reconciliation bill. The measure includes provisions to ban funds for Planned Parenthood and repeal the Affordable Care Act. House Republicans\u2019 expected approval of the bill, which the Senate passed early this month, would send it to Mr. Obama.\n\nThe president has promised a veto. But congressional Republicans say the effort will show they can pass such conservative priorities over Democrats\u2019 opposition \u2014 and get them signed into law once a Republican president is elected. They hope Mr. Obama\u2019s veto will elevate the issues of Planned Parenthood and abortion rights more broadly in the 2016 election debate as the parties contend for control of the White House and the Senate. Yet for several vulnerable Senate Republicans from Democratic-leaning states, the less their party says about the issues, the better.\n\nAt Planned Parenthood, officials say they know the fight is not over. But a spokesman, Eric Ferrero, said, \u201cIt\u2019s a testament to the incredible outpouring of support we\u2019ve seen for Planned Parenthood that after six months of trying, extreme members of Congress weren\u2019t able to sneak a single defunding measure into the final budget.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn the Senate, where Republicans hold 54 seats, appropriations bills and most other legislation need 60 votes to avoid filibusters, a threshold that has allowed Democrats to block many House-passed measures, including against Planned Parenthood.\n\nBut budget reconciliation bills pass with a simple majority under special Senate rules. The reconciliation bill awaiting House action passed the Senate, 52 to 47.\n\n\u201cIt was long ago decided our best shot at getting a defunding bill to the president\u2019s desk was through reconciliation,\u201d said Brendan Buck, a senior adviser to the speaker.\n\nInitially, that strategy drew fire from influential conservative groups and some lawmakers and prominent talk-radio hosts, who all insisted that only the year-end government funding bill gave Republicans leverage. Mr. Obama could veto the reconciliation bill without political cost, they argued, but vetoing the government-spending bill would make him culpable for a shutdown.\n\nTypically, such opposition might have thwarted Republican leaders. But they had support and political cover from other conservative groups, who were mindful that Republicans received most of the public\u2019s blame for a government shutdown in October 2013. The allies included abortion opponents such as the National Right to Life Committee and the Family Research Council.\n\nThe National Right to Life Committee, in a recent newsletter to supporters, acknowledged that it differed with some groups like Heritage Action and with talk show hosts who wanted to tie government funding to a cutoff of Planned Parenthood funds. \u201cBut most mainstream pro-life groups,\u201d it said, \u201csaw this as a dead-end strategy.\u201d\n\nAccording to leadership aides in both parties, Mr. Ryan did press for Democrats to acquiesce to one anti-abortion provision in the government spending measure \u2014 a proposed ban on any laws requiring health facilities, medical professionals or insurers to participate in abortion activities. But over a private dinner early this month, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House minority leader, told Mr. Ryan that the provision would cost him the Democratic votes he needed to pass the government spending bill.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, they got nothing,\u201d Mr. Holler said of Republican leaders.\n\nIf next week\u2019s House vote is Republicans\u2019 last try for legislation against Planned Parenthood \u2014 for now \u2014 there will still be hearings in several committees through 2016 that will keep alive the questions over how fetal tissue from abortions is handled. A little more than half of roughly 700 Planned Parenthood centers perform abortions, and a few of those, in three West Coast states, have arrangements to provide tissue from fetuses or fetal placenta to researchers.\n\nThe main event is an investigation by a special House committee that Republicans have named the Select Investigative Panel on Infant Lives and Democrats call the Special Republican Committee to Attack Women\u2019s Health.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIts chairwoman, Representative Marsha Blackburn, Republican of Tennessee, said in an emailed statement that the panel would focus on \u201cabortion industry medical practices\u201d and \u201cthe procurement industry\u201d for fetal tissue. Its report is expected to be ready by December \u2014 after the November elections.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20151229202221, "twitter": {"description": "After five years of fruitless legislative attacks, a House vote next week is likely to be the last, conservative activists say, until a Republican moves into the White House.", "title": "Break Is Likely in Planned Parenthood Funding Battle", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/30/us/politics/break-is-likely-in-planned-parenthood-funding-battle.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004117044"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "creator": "calmesnyt", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/30/us/politics/break-is-likely-in-planned-parenthood-funding-battle.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004117044", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/30/us/politics/break-is-likely-in-planned-parenthood-funding-battle.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us/politics", "hdl_p": "Break Is Likely in Planned Parenthood Funding Battle", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Dec. 29, 2015", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "Republican Party", "keywords": "Planned Parenthood Federation of America,United States Politics and Government,Abortion,Republican Party,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Boehner  John A,Obama  Barack,Ryan  Paul D Jr", "news_keywords": "Abortion", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Jackie Calmes", "SCG": "politics", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Ryan, Paul D Jr", "byl": "By JACKIE CALMES", "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "After five years of fruitless legislative attacks, a House vote next week is likely to be the last, conservative activists say, until a Republican moves into the White House.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "description": "After five years of fruitless legislative attacks, a House vote next week is likely to be the last, conservative activists say, until a Republican moves into the White House.", "CG": "us", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Dec. 29, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/c/jackie_calmes/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/section/us", "section": "Politics", "modified": "2015-12-30", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "tag": "Ryan, Paul D Jr", "published": "2015-12-29", "section-taxonomy-id": "23FD6C8B-62D5-4CEA-A331-6C2A9A1223BE"}, "slug": "30abortion", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20151230154208, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/30/us/politics/break-is-likely-in-planned-parenthood-funding-battle.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article", "description": "After five years of fruitless legislative attacks, a House vote next week is likely to be the last, conservative activists say, until a Republican moves into the White House.", "title": "Break Is Likely in Planned Parenthood Funding Battle"}, "pdate": 20151229, "des": "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010)", "articleid": 100000004117044, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Break Is Likely in Planned Parenthood Funding Battle", "PST": "News"}, "article_summary": "But for many conservatives, those expectations for 2016 do not include a continued fight to defund Planned Parenthood.\nThe measure includes provisions to ban funds for Planned Parenthood and repeal the Affordable Care Act.\nAt Planned Parenthood, officials say they know the fight is not over.\nYet for several vulnerable Senate Republicans from Democratic-leaning states, the less their party says about the issues, the better.\nCarol Tobias, the president of the National Right to Life Committee, wrote in an email: \u201cWe won\u2019t be able to remove federal funds from Planned Parenthood while this president is still in office."}
