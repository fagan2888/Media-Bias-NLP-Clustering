Once there, she pushed. What happened next can be seen in the video above. When the little otter starts to emerge, she reaches down and yanks the pup all the way out, and begins to groom it. Grooming warms the pup and keeps its fur clean, fluffy, and buoyant. The Monterey Bay Aquarium managed to catch the birth on film, and streamed it on Periscope.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nSouthern sea otters (Enhydra lutris nereis) like this one have sheltered in the aquarium\u2019s tide pool during or immediately after giving birth twice before. But this is the first time that people have been able to watch. More importantly, these births are encouraging signs that the sea otter population is growing, after being decimated by the fur trade in the 18th and 19th centuries.\n\nAquarium officials can\u2019t tell what sex the pup is\u2014it\u2019s too fluffy for them to get a clear view\u2014but they say the mother and pup seem to be doing well. And mom\u2019s job isn\u2019t done yet: after gestating the pup for four to six months before giving birth, she\u2019ll now have to keep an eye on it for up to another year.. She\u2019ll nurse it for the first month, before eventually introducing it to solid foods like crabs, snails, and sea urchins. And she\u2019s doing all of this by herself. Female otters and their pups usually congregate in groups called rafts, but males live in groups of their own, or wander from group to group\u2014and they don\u2019t stick around long after mating.\n\nRight now, this little otter is an only child. Although otter moms might occasionally give birth to multiples, they can only care for one pup each year\u2014so in the case of twins, one is typically abandoned.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.subheadline": "This pregnant otter pulled into an aquarium\u2019s tide pool to give birth.", "sailthru.author": "Rachel Becker", "description": "A very pregnant wild sea otter swam into the Monterey Bay Aquarium\u2019s Great Tide Pool on Sunday morning, and popped out a little slime-covered pup.
