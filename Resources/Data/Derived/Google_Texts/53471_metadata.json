Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Spokane, says she wants you to share your stories of the Affordable Care Act, on a helpful little site run by the House Republican caucus, which she chairs.\n\nOne of McMorris Rodgers\u2019 constituents, Molly Donnelly McGee, had a quick response:\n\nNot exactly what McMorris Rodgers was looking for. She earned the nickname \u201cShutdown Cathy\u201d as the public face of House GOP caucus during its disastrous effort to block the Affordable Care Act at any cost, including a 17-day government shutdown.\n\nShawn Vestal , columnist at the (Spokane) Spokesman-Review (and an old friend), wrote about her willingness to shade the truth about the Affordable Care Act.\n\nShutdown Cathy once said, in an email to constituents, that insurance premiums for Eastern Washington families had risen by $3,000 between 2012 and 2013. Before Obamacare, but never mind. On CNN, she bumped it up to $7,500. The Seattle Times checked it out and concluded this: The \u201csource for that figure \u2013 the 2013 survey by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation and provided by McMorris Rodgers\u2019 office \u2013 says family premiums rose from 2012 by 4 percent, or $629. Of that, $452 on average was borne directly by employers, not employees.\u201d Her office later said she misspoke. Never mind.\n\nThe irony of McMorris Rodgers\u2019 role as Obamacare national demonizer-in-chief is that the Affordable Care Act is working in her home state. Washington chose to embrace the Affordable Care Act, tailor its own website to the local insurance market, and brought in smart people from the tech industry. Since the Oct. 1, launch, more than 100,000 people have enrolled or completed health insurance applications via the state\u2019s wahealthplanfinder.org website. Here\u2019s another anecdote, which I don\u2019t think McMorris Rodgers will like any more than Molly McGee\u2019s. Fox News writer Sally Krohn braved the glitches of the glitchy healthcare.gov site and \u2013 presto \u2013 she got better health insurance at a big savings. Plus in the past, I spent several days looking for and comparing insurance options. Under ObamaCare, even with the slow and sticky website, I spent a total of four hours \u2014 to save over $5,400. That kind of return on investment would make Warren Buffett drool. Counter to wild stories about the government taking over health care, the exchange was simply a public portal to a range of all-private insurance options.\n\nI hope McMorris Rodgers will read these. But something tells me she won\u2019t pay attention.", "article_metadata": {"t_omni_path": "st|editorialsopinion|opinionnorthwest|front|article", "description": "On her Facebook page, Rep.
