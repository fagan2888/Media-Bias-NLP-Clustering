It\u2019s one of a series of bills hoping to tackle the issue.\n\nBut on Tuesday afternoon, State Rep. Matt Lynch (R) offered an amendment to SB 276 that has the exact same language as the six-week abortion ban that a handful of Republicans have been trying to advance in the current lame duck session. Six other lawmakers signaled their support for the amended version of the bill.\n\nThe surprise move didn\u2019t go over well with most of Lynch\u2019s colleagues in the House, who blocked the vote on SB 276 to avoid passing the so-called \u201cheatbeat bill\u201d \u2014 which has earned that nickname because it would criminalize abortion as soon as a fetal heartbeat can be detected. The speaker of the House told the Columbus Dispatch that he doesn\u2019t like last-minute amendments of that \u201cmagnitude.\u201d\n\nAlthough lawmakers could continue using procedural moves to delay a vote on SB 276, some members of the legislature aren\u2019t pleased about being forced to stall the infant mortality bill. The measure has already passed the Senate and was expected to reach Gov. John Kasich\u2019s (R) desk.\n\nOhio Sen. Charleta Tavares (D), one of the co-sponsors of SB 276, plans to remove her name from the legislation if it moves forward with the heartbeat bill amendment intact. Tavares\u2019 office confirmed to ThinkProgress that the senator does not support the proposed six-week abortion ban.\n\n\u201cIt would be a shame for such a bill to lose support,\u201d Celeste Glasgow Ribbins, the director of communications at Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio, told ThinkProgress. \u201cIt\u2019s unconscionable for legislators to add extreme language that would be detrimental to women\u2019s health into a bill that was clearly designed to improve health outcomes for people in the state.\u201d\n\nSix-week bans are so controversial that they often divide the anti-choice community; indeed, this measure has repeatedly failed in Ohio\u2019s legislature. Because heartbeat bills are a clear violation of Roe v. Wade, which guarantees legal access to abortion until the point of viability at about 23 weeks, even conservative lawmakers are wary that passing them will provoke court challenges.\n\nNonetheless, a far-right group called Faith2Action is pressuring supporters to do everything in their power \u2014 including fasting and praying \u2014 to advance the heartbeat bill this year. And in the legislature, proponents of the measure have done their part to pull out all the stops. A few weeks ago, they restructured a House committee to stack it with lawmakers who support the policy, which allowed it to advance.\n\nMeanwhile, Planned Parenthood officials say they have gathered nearly 30,000 signatures from Ohio voters who oppose the proposed ban and don\u2019t want to see it move any further. Last week, opponents protested against the six-week ban on the steps of the statehouse.\n\n\u201cIt has failed previously because we believe politicians recognize that it\u2019s unconstitutional,\u201d Glasgow Ribbins said. \u201cIt\u2019s highly unpopular, and we\u2019re going to continue doing everything we can to amplify the voices of the people who want to see this stopped.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "At the last minute, lawmakers tacked a radical abortion ban onto an unrelated bill about public health.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "At the last minute, lawmakers tacked a radical abortion ban onto an unrelated bill about public health.", "title": "Ohio Lawmakers Work To Sneak Through Extreme Six Week Abortion Ban", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/12/10/3601528/ohio-sneak-six-week-ban/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/shutterstock_139263098-e1382473775762.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "At the last minute, lawmakers tacked a radical abortion ban onto an unrelated bill about public health.", "title": "Ohio Lawmakers Work To Sneak Through Extreme Six Week Abortion Ban", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/shutterstock_139263098-e1382473775762-321x214.jpg", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/shutterstock_139263098-e1382473775762.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/shutterstock_139263098-e1382473775762.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-10T08:57:43+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde5d0\"", "article_summary": "Health Ohio Lawmakers Work To Sneak Through Extreme Six Week Abortion Ban CREDIT: ShutterstockOn Tuesday, facing an uphill battle in their attempt to pass a stringent anti-abortion bill as a standalone measure, Ohio lawmakers attempted to tack it onto an unrelated piece of legislation that aims to reduce infant mortality.\nNonetheless, a far-right group called Faith2Action is pressuring supporters to do everything in their power \u2014 including fasting and praying \u2014 to advance the heartbeat bill this year.\nSenate Bill 276 is primarily concerned with lowering the state\u2019s disproportionately high rate of infant deaths by requiring the Ohio Department of Health to establish a sleep safety program.\nOhio Sen.
