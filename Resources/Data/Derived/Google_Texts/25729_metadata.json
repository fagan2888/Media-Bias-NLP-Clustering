There is an issue of confidence.\u201d\n\nSpecifically, the prince blasted Mr. Obama for reneging on promises \u2014 a habit that\u2019s been shown by recent polls about Obamacare to plague the president with constituents in the United States, too. As far as international relations go, the prince said Mr. Obama needs to step up his game and do what he vows.\n\nWith allies, \u201cyou should be able to give them the assurance that what you say is going to be what you do,\u201d the prince said, The Times reported.\n\nSaudi leaders have been especially upset with Mr. Obama\u2019s reluctance to send in military troops to Syria \u2014 and are outraged that he decided against punitive action for President Bashar Assad\u2019s use of chemical weapons on civilians. Mr. Obama had on several occasions cited the \u201cred line\u201d for military intervention in Syria was the discovery of Mr. Assad\u2019s use of chemical weapons on his own people.\n\nThe Saudis say this backtrack, combined with Mr. Obama\u2019s turn to Congress for approval for any strike \u2014 which was largely denied \u2014 has basically emboldened the Syrian government. And on Sunday, the prince said the world\u2019s reluctance to halt the violence in Syria was nearly \u201ca criminal negligence,\u201d The Times reported.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Saudi prince sent a harsh message to President Obama and his administration, saying White House waffling and indecision has compromised the ability of the United States to nail down a peace pact between Israel and the Palestinians.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A Saudi prince sent a harsh message to President Obama and his administration, saying White House waffling and indecision has compromised the ability of the United States to nail down a peace pact between Israel and the Palestinians.", "title": "Saudi prince to Obama: You\u2019ve made a mess of the Mideast", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/dec/16/saudi-prince-obama-youve-made-mess-mideast/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2009/04/27/ALFAISAL_082_042712.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2009/04/27/ALFAISAL_082_042712.jpg", "description": "A Saudi prince sent a harsh message to President Obama and his administration, saying White House waffling and indecision has compromised the ability of the United States to nail down a peace pact bet", "card": "summary", "title": "Saudi prince to Obama: You\u2019ve made a mess of the Mideast"}, "Author": "Cheryl K.
