Fact Check: Sheheen’s Campaign Blasts Gov. Haley For First-Term Mishaps (Image 1)

A political ad released Monday targets Gov. Nikki Haley’s Democratic challenger Vincent Sheheen for his support of the Affordable Care Act.

But some of the claims made in the ad, which the Republican Governors Association produced, are not accurate, according to USC Upstate political science professor Trevor Rubenzer.

The ad claims that the Affordable Care Act would equate to two million jobs lost, about 34,000 of which would be in South Carolina. While Trevor Rubenzer said that claim is based in fact, it lacks the necessary context.

“It’s more hour losses than job losses and a lot of those would be voluntary.”

In other words, while Rubenzer said the Affordable Care Act could result in two million fewer jobs, it wouldn’t mean people would lose their job, but would instead work fewer hours.

Rubenzer said the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office projects the job losses in hours because people would be able to get coverage without working as many hours.

The ad also claims that Sheheen “…supported much of Obamacare,” a claim Rubenzer said is true.

Sheheen sent a letter to New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who is the chairman of the Republican Governors Association, calling the ad “hypocritical.”
