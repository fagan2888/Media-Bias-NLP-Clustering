Whether he was aided and abetted by the Holy Spirit I leave for others to determine.\n\nDuring the three-week Synod of Bishops on the Family, those belonging to what the National Catholic Reporter\u2019s Michael Sean Winters christened \u201cTeam Javert\u201d weighed in early and often against any relaxation of the rules. \u201cTeam Valjean,\u201d by contrast, held its fire until the final week, and then unloaded.\n\nThe key player, besides Francis himself, appears to have been the powerful head of the Vatican\u2019s Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, Cardinal Gerhard M\u00fcller. A theological stickler appointed by Pope Benedict, he was among the 13 cardinals who signed a Javertian letter to the pope protesting the Synod\u2019s ways and means. The letter was leaked to Sandro Magister, Francis\u2019 leading critic among Vaticanistas and the journalist who became persona non grata at the Vatican after he published an almost final version of the pope\u2019s environment encyclical Laudato si\u2019 ahead of its embargoed release date.\n\nI figured that if the Gang of 13 included M\u00fcller, any significant opening to the divorced and remarried had to be DOA. And then, at the crucial moment, M\u00fcller joined Team Valjean. The \u201ccircle\u201d of German-speaking bishops, which included arch-progressive Cardinal Walter Kasper and learned aristocrat Cardinal Christoph Sch\u00f6nborn (make that Christoph Maria Michael Hugo Damian Peter Adalbert, Count of Sch\u00f6nborn) along with M\u00fcller, unanimously approved a proposal to allow the divorced and remarried access to the Eucharist by way of \u201cthe internal forum\u201d \u2014 a canonical mechanism whereby determinations are made without publicity.\n\nThat proved to be the approach taken in the the final report\u2019s crucial paragraph 85, which achieved the necessary two-thirds\u2019 support with just one vote to spare. Wrapping up the Synod afterwards, Francis bluntly informed the bishops that the gathering had been about, among other things, \u201claying bare the closed hearts which frequently hide even behind the Church\u2019s teachings or good intentions, in order to sit in the chair of Moses and judge, sometimes with superiority and superficiality, difficult cases and wounded families.\u201d Ouch. No one should think that he will fail to cash the check that the Synod has handed him.\n\nAt the end of the day, the pope\u2019s side proved that it has learned how to round up votes and do a whip count, and under the circumstances my advice to Paul Ryan would be to consult with the archbishop of Washington, Cardinal Donald Wuerl, in preparation for becoming the next Speaker of the House. Of course, Ryan will not be able to rely on the Holy Spirit. That always makes things more difficult.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Institutions, Opinion, Catholic, Synod of Bishops on the Family", "generator": "Easy Digital Downloads v2.5.16", "og": {"site_name": "Religion News Service", "description": "An Argentine-German axis enables an opening to the divorced and remarried.", "title": "Big win for Pope Francis", "url": "http://religionnews.com/2015/10/25/big-win-for-pope-francis/", "image": "http://religionnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/M\u00fcller.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@RNS", "card": "summary", "creator": "@directorsilk"}, "syndication-source": "http://religionnews.com/2015/10/25/big-win-for-pope-francis/", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://religionnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-RNS_logo_RGB-336x336.gif", "original-source": "http://religionnews.com/2015/10/25/big-win-for-pope-francis/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "An Argentine-German axis enables an opening to the divorced and remarried."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdc47\"", "article_summary": "A theological stickler appointed by Pope Benedict, he was among the 13 cardinals who signed a Javertian letter to the pope protesting the Synod\u2019s ways and means.\nThe key player, besides Francis himself, appears to have been the powerful head of the Vatican\u2019s Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, Cardinal Gerhard M\u00fcller.\nI figured that if the Gang of 13 included M\u00fcller, any significant opening to the divorced and remarried had to be DOA.\nWhether he was aided and abetted by the Holy Spirit I leave for others to determine.\nNo one should think that he will fail to cash the check that the Synod has handed him."}
