Americans for Prosperity has been crisscrossing the state of Montana, in an attempt to pressure moderate Republican lawmakers into signing a pledge to block Medicaid expansion. On Thursday, they brought their traveling road show to Kalispell. However, the residents of the small Northwestern Montana town were unpersuaded by the Koch-funded group.\n\nThe AFP chose to set a meeting in Kalispell because the district is represented by Frank Garner, a Republican who has declined to sign a pledge opposing Medicaid expansion in Montana. AFP targeted Garner along with fellow representatives, Jeff Welborn (R-Dillon) and Tom Berry (R-Roundup), for not bowing to the Koch Brothers\u2019 edict to block Medicaid expansion.\n\nThe expansion would extend affordable health care access to 70,000 low-income residents in the Big Sky state. Montana\u2019s Governor Steve Bullock (D) has vowed to support the expansion, but he faces an uncooperative Republican-controlled legislature. However, some Republicans, including Garner, have indicated a desire to compromise with the Governor so that more Montanans can get inexpensive health care coverage. That willingness to cooperate with Democrats has made Garner a target for the Koch brothers.\n\nAmericans for Prosperity sent out flyers with Garner\u2019s face superimposed over Barack Obama\u2019s, to tie the GOP lawmaker to the President. The mailers urged constituents to \u201cTell Frank Garner to stand with us and vote no on ObamaCare\u2019s expansion in Montana\u201d. Garner claims he was not extended an invitation to the meeting. He found out about the event from a reporter on the House floor, in the Capitol building, in Helena.\n\nThe Koch brothers may have been expecting an easy propaganda victory in the small Montana town of 20,000. However, the plan backfired, as around a hundred local residents, and Representative Garner, gave them an earful, instead. The AFP spokesperson was frequently interrupted by boos, shouts, and derisive laughter. Feeding on the crowd\u2019s boisterous energy, Representative Garner blasted the Koch Brothers\u2019 organization, declaring:\n\nI promised the people here when I ran that I would listen to you and not out-of-town special interests. If every time they want me to sign a pledge card and I don\u2019t do it they are going to rent a room and have a meeting, then this is going to get real expensive. Cause I\u2019m not signing the pledge card.\n\nThunderous applause followed.\n\nLocal residents were incensed by the outside group trying to intimidate their representative. An audience member, Nathan Kosted, confronted the AFP spokesperson and said:\n\nWhy did you call this a town hall meeting? I didn\u2019t get an invite. I wish I\u2019d been invited, because I want to know how we get the Koch Brothers out of politics. I want to know how we get you out of politics.\n\nAnother person in attendance was even more blunt. The man stated:\n\nYou have pissed me off. Character assassination does not go down well in Montana. If he (Garner) has to take a pledge then I want it to be the Pledge of Allegiance, because they don\u2019t represent you, they represent me.\n\nThe Koch Brothers probably thought opposition to Obamacare would be an easy sell in small town Montana, but their town hall meeting backfired in epic fashion. Much to their chagrin, there are still some Republican lawmakers in Montana who can\u2019t be bought off, and some voters who won\u2019t fall in line, no matter how many millions the Koch Brothers\u2019 decide to spend.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Koch Brothers probably thought opposition to Obamacare would be an easy sell in Kalispell, but their town hall meeting backfired.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Keith Brekhus", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "The Koch Brothers probably thought opposition to Obamacare would be an easy sell in Kalispell, but their town hall meeting backfired.", "title": "Koch Brothers Group Shouted Down By Irate Citizens During Montana Town Hall Meeting", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2015/02/10/koch-brothers-group-shouted-irate-citizens-montana-town-hall-meeting.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/koch-brothers-feat.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-02-10T15:59:49+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Featured News,Issues,Republican Party,AFP spokesperson,americans for prosperity,Barack Obama,Frank Garner,Jeff Welborn,Koch Brothers,Nathan Kosted,Steve Bullock,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Republican Party", "published_time": "2015-02-10T15:59:49+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-10T15:59:49+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "AFP spokesperson, americans for prosperity, Barack Obama, Frank Garner, Jeff Welborn, Koch Brothers, Nathan Kosted, Republican Party, Steve Bullock"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdba04\"", "article_summary": "The Koch Brothers probably thought opposition to Obamacare would be an easy sell in small town Montana, but their town hall meeting backfired in epic fashion.\nThe Koch brothers may have been expecting an easy propaganda victory in the small Montana town of 20,000.\nA \u201cHealthcare Town Hall\u201d set up by the Koch brothers\u2019 Americans for Prosperity (AFP) group, in Kalispell, Montana, turned raucous on Thursday night.\nI wish I\u2019d been invited, because I want to know how we get the Koch Brothers out of politics.\nHowever, the residents of the small Northwestern Montana town were unpersuaded by the Koch-funded group."}
