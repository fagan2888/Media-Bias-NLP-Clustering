Incumbents always win. That's conventional wisdom -- and, by and large, it's right. Whether it's a "wave" year or not, at least eight in 10 (and often many more) incumbents who seek reelection get it. Here, the Center for Responsive Politics makes that point in chart form:

And yet, the stratospheric reelection rates for incumbents glosses over the fact that Congress -- particularly in the past three election cycles -- has seen major turnover through retirement, runs for other offices and, well, death.

Republican lobbyist Bruce Mehlman shared this slide from his latest PowerPoint presentation -- a must-see in D.C.! -- that reveals just how few members of Congress have been around for some of the major legislative -- and other -- moments of the past decade (or so).

Mehlman's chart is all the more amazing when you consider that Congress voted on the Affordable Care Act in March 2010. That means that in less than five years, about half of the House and the Senate membership has turned over. Just one in four members of the House and the Senate were in office at the time of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.

It's a reminder that Congress is like an ocean. (Potential bad metaphor alert!) It always looks the same on the surface but is constantly changing and moving just below the water line.
