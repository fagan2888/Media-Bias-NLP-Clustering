Or, put another way, sleep is emerging as one of the most potent weapons you can use to stave off depression, anxiety and a whole host of other physical and mental ills.\n\nHere\u2019s the latest pro-sleep research by psychologists at Binghamton University in New York. Their new paper, \u201cDuration and Timing of Sleep are Associated with Repetitive Negative Thinking\u201d is just published in the journal Cognitive Therapy and Research.\n\nFrom the news release:\n\nWhen you go to bed, and how long you sleep at a time, might actually make it difficult for you to stop worrying. So say Jacob Nota and Meredith Coles of Binghamton University in the U.S., who found that people who sleep for shorter periods of time and go to bed very late at night are often overwhelmed with more negative thoughts than those who keep more regular sleeping hours\u2026\n\nPrevious studies have linked sleep problems with such repetitive negative thoughts, especially in cases where someone does not get enough shuteye. Nota and Coles set out to replicate these studies, and to further see if there\u2019s any link between having such repetitive thoughts and the actual time when someone goes to bed.\n\nThey asked 100 young adults at Binghamton University to complete a battery of questionnaires and two computerized tasks. In the process, it was measured how much the students worry, ruminate or obsess about something \u2013 three measures by which repetitive negative thinking is gauged.\n\nThe students were also asked whether they were more habitual morning or evening types, preferring to hold regular hours or to have a sleep-wake schedule that is more skewed towards later in the day,\n\nThe researchers found that people who sleep for shorter periods of time and go to bed later often experience more repetitive negative thoughts than others. This was also true for those students who described themselves as evening types.\n\n\u201cMaking sure that sleep is obtained during the right time of day may be an inexpensive and easily disseminable intervention for individuals who are bothered by intrusive thoughts,\u201d remarks Nota.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sleep is the new Prozac.
