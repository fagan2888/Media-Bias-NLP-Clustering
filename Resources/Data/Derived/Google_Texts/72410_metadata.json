GOP could chip away at Obamacare\n\nA Republican-controlled Senate cannot repeal Obamacare, no matter how fervently GOP candidates pledge to do so on the campaign trail this fall. But if they do win the majority, Senate Republicans could inflict deep and lasting damage to the president\u2019s signature law.\n\nRepublicans are quick to say they are not yet measuring the proverbial drapes. But they are taking the political measurements of repealing large parts of the health law, considering which pieces could be repealed with Democratic support, and how to leverage the annual appropriations and budget process to eliminate funding or large pieces of the law.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nInitial targets are likely to include the medical device tax, the individual and employer mandates, the 30-hour workweek to qualify for coverage, and spending on a preventive health fund that Republicans call a slush fund.\n\nThe GOP is highly unlikely to get the 60 votes needed to pass most legislation, including full repeal of the Affordable Care Act. And President Barack Obama would veto any bill that significantly hurts the law, which is now covering millions of Americans, during his remaining two years in the White House.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Senate showdown: GOP frets over Harkin seat)\n\nIf Republicans win the Senate, Mitch McConnell, the likely majority leader, is expected to hold a symbolic repeal vote early in the new Congress.\n\n\u201cThe real question is what comes next,\u201d said Stephen Northrup, a former senior Republican Senate health staffer and now a partner at Rampy Northrup.\n\nOptions would range from a targeted repeal of small slices of the law to a broad slash-and-burn strategy. Republicans say that if they win in November, members will decide together how exactly to move ahead. But GOP sources said some strategy discussions already are underway.\n\nTargeted votes would aim at specific vulnerable aspects of Obamacare, like the device tax, which some Democrats may back. The GOP could also use appropriations battles to require the White House to accept some changes or cuts to the law to get other priorities funded, a strategy McConnell has publicly embraced.\n\nAnd Republicans could use a budget process known as reconciliation, which requires a simple 51-vote majority, to gut significant parts.\n\n\u201cIf the Republicans win both the House and Senate, that certainly goes a long way in providing them with new tools they haven\u2019t had in the past,\u201d said former HHS Secretary Mike Leavitt, who studied these options as the leader of Mitt Romney\u2019s transition team in 2012.\n\nRepublicans are already eying the specific pieces of Obamacare that might tempt enough Democrats to vote with them to hit that 60-vote mark. Even some liberals have concluded that the twice-delayed employer mandate was poorly designed.\n\n\u201cThere are bills that have passed the House with big bipartisan votes that I believe we can get Democrats on board to support in the Senate, because they are positions that are really important for the American people,\u201d Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming, chairman of the Republican Policy Committee, said in a recent telephone interview.\n\nThe targeted bills could still face an Obama veto, which would be virtually impossible for the GOP to override. And surgically removing the most unpopular pieces of the law while leaving other pieces intact could create a whole new set of problems. For instance, protecting people with pre-existing conditions, which is popular, while scrapping the individual mandate, which is unpopular, could send premiums soaring.\n\nLeavitt warned that Republicans have to be able to speak about how they would cover uninsured Americans in a way that is more ideologically aligned with their principles. Polls show the health law remains unpopular, dramatically so with the Republican base. Yet millions of Americans are now getting covered, many with government subsidies.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be important that members remember that people don\u2019t like Obamacare or the Affordable Care Act, but they do want reform,\u201d he said. \u201cThe position of the party cannot be one that appears to lack the compassion that people need health care.\u201d\n\nSome conservatives are exploring the idea of removing \u201crepeal\u201d from the GOP mantra. Avik Roy, a conservative health policy expert, has outlined a plan in which Republicans significantly change the ACA to make it more free-market oriented and state-based. But his plan doesn\u2019t embrace the politically unpopular position of taking away consumers\u2019 newfound insurance. But that discussion is still mostly among policy experts, not on the Hill.\n\nRepublicans have not yet come to consensus on how to replace the law and articulate their own health vision.\n\n\u201cI think we ought to also spend more time on the replacement side,\u201d Ohio Sen Rob Portman said at a recent breakfast sponsored by The Christian Science Monitor. \u201cLet\u2019s replace it with something that does deal with a very real problem in our health care system, and that is the increased cost and the lack of coverage.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the past, the attitude has been 100 percent or nothing \u2014 repeal or nothing,\u201d said Tevi Troy, president of the American Health Policy Institute and a former adviser to Romney and former President George W. Bush. \u201cThe longer the law is in effect, the less likely a 100 percent strategy rules the day.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Republicans could use votes targeted at specific aspects of the law.", "title": "GOP could chip away at Obamacare", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/09/2014-elections-gop-senate-obamacare-110936.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/08/11/140811_obamacare_website_gty_328.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Obamacare,Senate Republicans,Republicans,Health Care,Affordable Care Act", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Republicans could use votes targeted at specific aspects of the law.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "GOP could chip away at ObamacareA Republican-controlled Senate cannot repeal Obamacare, no matter how fervently GOP candidates pledge to do so on the campaign trail this fall.\n\u201cThe real question is what comes next,\u201d said Stephen Northrup, a former senior Republican Senate health staffer and now a partner at Rampy Northrup.\nBut if they do win the majority, Senate Republicans could inflict deep and lasting damage to the president\u2019s signature law.\nAnd surgically removing the most unpopular pieces of the law while leaving other pieces intact could create a whole new set of problems.\nPolls show the health law remains unpopular, dramatically so with the Republican base."}
