A source tells News On 6 Luke Russell is the son of suspected child molester Clyde Russell, also of Jenks.

A Jenks man on his way out of the Tulsa jail was re-arrested for grabbing a girl's rear end in the jail lobby. Luke Wilson Russell, 23, is back in custody on a complaint of a making a lewd act against a child.

Wilson was originally arrested Saturday evening for public drunk, according to court records. He was released on that complaint Sunday afternoon. Shortly afterward, a woman in the front lobby of the jail complained that a man "touched her daughter's butt," an arrest report states.

The arresting deputy said the woman and her daughter were there to visit a relative at the jail. Russell reportedly sat by the little girl and talked loudly to himself for a few minutes. A witness told police she saw the girl jump up and move to the other side of the room, looking very scared.

The child told her mother that Russell had grabbed her and then asked her to take his lighter, according to the report.

Russell was booked back into jail less than 24 hours after his first arrest. His bond for the public drunk complaint was $150. He is back in a cell for making a lewd act against a child on a $100,000 bond.

A source tells News On 6 Russell is the son of Clyde Russell, who was arrested December 18, 2013, on two counts of child sexual abuse. Police believe Clyde Russell began molesting a family member in 2012 and they are looking into the possibility of more victims.
