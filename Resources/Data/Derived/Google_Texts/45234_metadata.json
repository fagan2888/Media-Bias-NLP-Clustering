Circumventing the physician will save women time and eliminate the co-pay tied to first visiting a doctor\u2019s office.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe traditional method just doesn\u2019t hold up very well. It requires women to take time off work or school in order to make an appointment that might not be easy to get,\u201d said Don Downing, a University of Washington School of Pharmacy professor who has researched and advocated for better access to birth control for nearly two decades.\n\n\n\n\u201cMany women don\u2019t necessarily have a primary care provider. \u2026 It will be great news for a lot of people who are sexually active, but who don\u2019t know where to turn,\u201d Downing added.\n\n\n\nThe new law may make women\u2019s lives easier, but it\u2019s also seen as a major step toward expanding the role of pharmacists amid a nationwide shortage of doctors. Fueled by an aging population and a growing number of people newly covered by insurance under the Affordable Care Act, the shortage could reach 90,400 physicians by 2025, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges.\n\n\n\n\u201cPharmacists are the experts on medications. This should be a really good thing for everybody,\u201d said Joyia Emard, a spokeswoman with the California Board of Pharmacy.\n\n\n\nCalifornia\u2019s new law also allows pharmacists to prescribe prescription-strength inhalers, gums and lozenges for nicotine addiction, as well as medication for travel abroad, including vaccinations and antibiotics. Along with hormonal contraceptives, these three categories of drugs are considered preventive services for major public health issues.\n\n\n\nThe law also creates an additional class of pharmacists, called advanced practice pharmacists, who, after earning special certification, will be able to initiate, adjust, or discontinue all types of drugs after referral from a physician.\n\n\n\nHormonal contraceptives are birth control pills, the skin patch and vaginal ring. Under the new law, women will still have to obtain a prescription from a doctor for an intrauterine device.\n\n\n\nThe new law, SB 493, is expected to go into effect as early as Oct. 1, said Emard, spokeswoman with the pharmacy board, which has spent the past year crafting protocols that spell out how pharmacists will prescribe contraceptives. The board recently finalized the protocols, but they still have to be reviewed by multiple state agencies for legal and budgetary approval.\n\n\n\nOn the first visit women will be required to fill out a form with their medical history and, for pills that pose a risk of hypertension, they will need to take a blood pressure test.\n\n\n\nSome physicians have questioned whether fewer women will get screenings for cancer and sexually transmitted diseases if they no longer have to visit a doctor to get birth control.\n\n\n\nBut Dr. Rachel Perry, a gynecologist and assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at UC Irvine, isn\u2019t concerned that one will impact the other.\n\n\n\n\u201cScreenings for cancer and STDs aren\u2019t medically required,\u201d she said. \u201cWhile these are necessary and important, I don\u2019t think they should be tied to birth control.\u201d\n\n\n\nHer position is supported by the American Congress of Obstetricians and gynecologists, which has argued that oral contraceptives should be available over-the-counter, meaning without a prescription, so they are even easier to obtain.\n\n\n\nThe group cites a 2004 nationwide phone survey of 811 women that found 47 percent of uninsured women and 40 percent of low-income women who were not using the pill, patch or ring would start using them if they were available from pharmacies without a prescription. Making pills, patch and ring available over the counter would be politically charged, but it also might create a price barrier, because they would no longer be covered by insurance, Downing, of the University of Washington, said.\n\n\n\nIn authoring California\u2019s new legislation, Ed Hernandez, a state senator from West Covina, argued that pharmacists are \u201cover-trained and under-utilized.\u201d\n\n\n\nMahtab Jafari, who directs UC Irvine\u2019s undergraduate program in pharmaceutical sciences, agrees.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe public doesn\u2019t really know about the education that pharmacists get,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat the public sees is a pharmacist behind the counter, counting pills and giving them medications, but pharmacists are very educated.\u201d\n\n\n\nPharmacy schools are adapting their curriculum to conform with SB 493. Jafari said she expects the changes will place an emphasis on teamwork, so pharmacists are prepared to communicate and share patients\u2019 drug information with doctors.\n\n\n\nPharmacists who have already graduated from school will need to take at least one hour of continuing education to be able to prescribe contraceptives. Some might already have started that training or will soon.\n\n\n\nJon Roth, CEO of the California Pharmacists Association, which co-sponsored SB 493, said independent and chain pharmacies will take advantage of the new law as soon as they can.\n\n\n\n\u201cI think they see this as an opportunity to expand patient services and they\u2019ll see consumer demand for it very quickly,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nDowning is a bit more doubtful.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have found that there were a tremendous number of women who, when asked if they thought if it was safe to go to pharmacist to get pills, patches and ring, said, \u2018Well isn\u2019t there a blood test or some other exam that is necessary?\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThere may be a very slow uptake until women disassociate cancer (and STD) screenings from birth control,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nContact the writer: jchandler@ocregister.com and @jennakchandler on Twitter\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"geo.placename": "Santa Ana", "geo.region": "US-CA", "content_section": "undef", "description": "Life: No doctor needed for birth control?
