It's hard to delete an ACA account\n\nOnce you finally make it into HealthCare.gov, it\u2019s not clear how you get out.\n\nFor those who\u2019ve busted through glitches on the federal Obamacare insurance website to create an account, there\u2019s no clear, obvious way for consumers to delete the accounts if they choose \u2014 at least not in the current incarnation.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nA POLITICO reporter used HealthCare.gov\u2019s customer support chat to request that an account be removed, but the support agent said the request would have to be referred to an \u201cadvanced\u201d customer service system.\n\n( POLITICO's guide to understanding Obamacare\n\nThe option to delete account information has become a staple of online services, from Facebook to Amazon. But HealthCare.gov isn\u2019t a private-sector business transaction. And on the federal health insurance portal, people for at least the next few weeks will have to create a basic account even to browse health plan options. That doesn\u2019t require all the personal and financial information that would be added to actually enroll in a health plan or seek government subsidies.\n\nObama administration officials declined to discuss specifics of any delete policy but a Department of Health and Human Services spokeswoman did address privacy. \u201cWe take privacy concerns very seriously and have put in place measures to protect consumers\u2019 personal information,\u201d said HHS spokeswoman Joanne Peters. \u201cWe have a long track record of working with sensitive information in programs like Medicare and Medicaid.\u201d\n\nPrivacy and tech experts had mixed reactions to the \u201cdelete\u201d gap.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want that information persisting on the website, especially when it\u2019s clear you\u2019re no longer interested in creating the account,\u201d said Chris Rasmussen, policy analyst at the Center for Democracy & Technology.\n\nBut information privacy consultant Bob Gellman said government retention standards likely come into play. And the standards for health record keeping is different from those in other sectors.\n\n\u201cAt the highest level of generality, I agree that it\u2019d be nice to delete your record at an appropriate point, but it\u2019s messy and you gotta figure out when and how,\u201d Gellman said.\n\nGellman said there are legitimate legal reasons why the government would have to retain the record. Consumers do see a privacy notice before creating an account.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t sound sinister to me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt sounds bureaucratic and that no one\u2019s thought about that yet.\u201d\n\nPam Dixon, executive director of the World Privacy Forum, said HealthCare.gov appears to fall under the umbrella of the National Archives and Records Administration, which gives agencies leeway on record-keeping for administrative, legal, audit or other operational purposes. She said many health care providers keep records for seven years but if the exchange policy is to keep them forever that would be \u201cdisconcerting for a number of reasons.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "At this point, there\u2019s no clear, obvious way for consumers to eliminate them.", "title": "It's hard to delete an ACA account", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2013/10/obamacare-website-problems-98029.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2013/10/02/130930_obamacare_ap_605.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Health Care (1601),Technology (712),Affordable Care Act (469),Obamacare (616)", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "At this point, there\u2019s no clear, obvious way for consumers to eliminate them.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfaf0\"", "article_summary": "( POLITICO's guide to understanding ObamacareThe option to delete account information has become a staple of online services, from Facebook to Amazon.\nIt's hard to delete an ACA accountOnce you finally make it into HealthCare.gov, it\u2019s not clear how you get out.\nObama administration officials declined to discuss specifics of any delete policy but a Department of Health and Human Services spokeswoman did address privacy.\nBut information privacy consultant Bob Gellman said government retention standards likely come into play.\nAnd the standards for health record keeping is different from those in other sectors."}
