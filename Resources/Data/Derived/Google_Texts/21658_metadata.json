Jackson. Northam was caught on camera refusing to shake Jackson\u2019s hand after supporting Obamacare and attacking conservative Christian voters.\n\nAs a pro-life, conservative African-American, Jackson has been pegged with the typical \u201cUncle Tom\u201d attacks throughout the campaign from liberals who claim he is selling out his ethnicity by taking principled conservative stances and opposing abortion.\n\nThe incident comes after Jackson found that one of his campaign signs in Virginia\u2019s Loudoun County had vandals smearing the sign with white paint.\n\nBrietbart News has more and a video (below at the 6:30 mark) of what happened.\n\nVirginia\u2019s top Democratic candidates Terry McAuliffe (running for governor) and Northam have portrayed themselves as pragmatic centrists who are happy to reach across the aisle. But this video shows Northam won\u2019t even reach across his chair. After a lively debate, at 6:30 in the video, Jackson\u2014the Republican candidate for lieutenant governor\u2014attempts to shake hands with Northam, who will not shake it and doesn\u2019t even look Jackson in the eye. At first, a viewer might give Northam the benefit of the doubt that somehow he doesn\u2019t see the extended hand. But Jackson dispels that doubt by taking his outstretched hand to tap Northam on the arm and then re-extends his hand almost into Northam\u2019s lap. Northam still refuses to take it.\n\nCLICK LIKE IF YOU\u2019RE PRO-LIFE!", "article_metadata": {"description": "White Democrat Refuses to Shake Hands With Pro-Life Black Lt.
