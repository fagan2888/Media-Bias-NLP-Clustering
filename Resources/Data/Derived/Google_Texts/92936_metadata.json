But isn\u2019t Planned Parenthood a non-profit organization and so forbidden, like Christian ministries, from overt political involvement? And since one-third of its income comes from the government, doesn\u2019t that mean that tax dollars are funding a political campaign?\n\nIt turns out that Planned Parenthood has formed a separate advocacy group to be its political arm. It presumably is financed by separate money. Still, I remember how careful Christian organizations I\u2019ve been involved have had to be to distance themselves from the very appearance of political involvement in order to protect their tax-exempt status. When it is being said that \u201cPlanned Parenthood\u201d is endorsing, rather than \u201cthe Planned Parenthood Action Fund,\u201d that would normally invite IRS scrutiny.\n\nAnyway, the endorsement may backfire, both against Planned Parenthood and against Mrs. Clinton.
