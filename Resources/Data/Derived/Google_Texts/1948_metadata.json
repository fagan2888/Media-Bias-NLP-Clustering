The proposal should be taken with a grain of salt, though, as the former governor doesn\u2019t provide a price tag for all the moves he wants to make.\n\nFor instance, Bush wants to scrap the plan enacted by the 2011 Budget Control Act that will reduce the Army\u2019s size to 450,000 soldiers by the end of fiscal 2018. If it holds, the force reduction will shrink the Army by 120,000 soldiers, from a peak of about 570,000 at the height of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan in 2011.\n\nEarlier this year, the service estimated the cuts would save $7 billion over four years. An Army spokesman told The Fiscal Times that the plan is still place, despite the budget deal struck last month by President Obama and congressional leaders.\n\nBush says the Marine Corps should also be maintained at 186,000 soldiers, reversing the service plan to shrink to 174,000 by the end of 2017.\n\nRelated: Congress Wants to Slam the Door on the Syrian Refugee Program\n\nFor the Navy, Bush wants to keep building two Virginia-class submarines a year. Each ship costs in the neighborhood of $3 billion. The Navy\u2019s 2016 shipbuilding plan calls for a fleet of 50 Virginia-class submarines by the mid-2040s; around 10 have been delivered so far.\n\nBush also vows to \u201chalt the mothballing of certain ships, such as cruisers, slated for premature retirement due to budget cuts,\u201d a move that could cost hundreds of millions.\n\nWith respect to the Air Force, Bush endorses buying a \u201cminimum\u201d of 100 Long Range Strike-Bombers, an effort that would cost more than $100 billion.\n\nAnd while he backs continuing with the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter -- which at $400 billion is the most expensive weapons program in U.S. history -- Bush \u201cwould explore other options for air supremacy. This could include restoring the F-22 line or accelerating development of a new air superiority combat system.\u201d\n\nRelated: The Fight Against ISIS Has New Price Tag: $5 Billion and Counting\n\nBush is also calling for the modernization of the U.S. nuclear forces. At the beginning of the year the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office estimated the country would need to spend $348 billion over the next decade maintain its atomic arsenal.\n\nAs for the Pentagon, Bush suggests there could be savings in acquisition reform; he says service secretaries and chief should have the ultimate say on buying weapons, which would reduce bureaucratic red tape and keep costs down.\n\nHis proposal lines up closely with reforms drafted by Senate Armed Services Committee chair John McCain (R-AZ) that were incorporated into this year\u2019s defense policy bill.\n\nBush maintains that the government could find savings in the roughly $100 billion the Pentagon spends each year on clerical and management costs. He says \u201cthere are useful comparisons to the private sector where implementing best practices can result in substantial productivity gains. This would result in savings that could invigorate neglected defense capabilities.\u201d\n\nRelated: The $43 Million Gas Station: Why We Need to Audit the Pentagon\n\nHe also takes aim at the department\u2019s civilian and military workforce. Bush estimates that 720,000 civilians work for the agency and cites a Government Accountability Office study that found the Army\u2019s leadership staff grew 60 percent since 2001, while the number of unfirmed soldiers dropped.\n\n\u201cThe Pentagon should begin to address this overgrowth by trimming redundant agencies as well as by enacting a program consisting of early retirements and voluntary separation packages that can free up money for uniformed military and combat operations.\u201d\n\nThe biggest pot of savings would come from making cuts to high-ranking personnel at Pentagon headquarters, who cost $40 billion annually, according to Bush\u2019s estimates.\n\nHe says he would order his Defense Secretary to appoint a task force aimed at reducing the enterprise.\n\n\u201cThe goal would be a 20% reduction, freeing up billions to support critical defense programs. The effort would be short and intense. Final recommendations would be made within 6 months, with implementation complete one year later,\u201d Bush says.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The same day he called for U.S. troops on the ground in the Middle East to combat ISIS, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush also offered a detailed \u2013 potentially very costly \u2013 plan for how he would \u201crebuild\u201d the Defense Department and the military services if he were commander-in-chief.", "title": "From Bombers to Subs, Inside Bush\u2019s Costly Plan to Expand the Military", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/18/Bombers-Subs-Inside-Bush-s-Costly-Plan-Expand-Military", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-politics-bush-jeb_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/18/Bombers-Subs-Inside-Bush-s-Costly-Plan-Expand-Military", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-politics-bush-jeb_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "The same day he called for U.S. troops on the ground in the Middle East to combat ISIS, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush also offered a detailed \u2013 potentially very costly \u2013 plan for how he would \u201crebuild\u201d the Defense Department and the military services if he were commander-in-chief.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Related: Congress Wants to Slam the Door on the Syrian Refugee ProgramFor the Navy, Bush wants to keep building two Virginia-class submarines a year.\nGround Troops to Fight ISISBut Bush\u2019s plan also goes into the details about the level of personnel and the kinds of weapons programs he wants to see.\nFor instance, Bush wants to scrap the plan enacted by the 2011 Budget Control Act that will reduce the Army\u2019s size to 450,000 soldiers by the end of fiscal 2018.\nBush says the Marine Corps should also be maintained at 186,000 soldiers, reversing the service plan to shrink to 174,000 by the end of 2017.\nBush maintains that the government could find savings in the roughly $100 billion the Pentagon spends each year on clerical and management costs."}
