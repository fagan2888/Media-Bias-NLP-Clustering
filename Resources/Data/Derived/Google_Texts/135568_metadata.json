They are then removed from the classroom with their typical peers and educated separately in the Futures Program.\n\nThe program is funded through the organization Pioneer RESA, not by a local school district. It serves students in Hall, Forsyth, Habersham, Dawson, Stephens, White and Union counties\u2019 public schools.\n\nUntil last May, the local program was housed in the Academy at Wood\u2019s Mill in Gainesville. The school is being converted into a Gainesville High School Ninth Grade Center, however, and the program is moving to a location in Habersham.\n\n\u201cThe school is a regional center that serves several school districts,\u201d said Merrianne Dyer, former Gainesville City Schools\u2019 superintendent. \u201cIt\u2019s not operated by the school district, but if the district has a student that can attend the school, they have a sort of contract with them.\u201d\n\nThe justice department\u2019s criticisms are not the first for the Gainesville-based program, however.\n\nThrough 2012, the Futures Program in Gainesville was known as an Alpine Psychoeducational Program center, where 13-year-old Jonathan King hanged himself while inside a \u201cseclusion room\u201d in 2004.\n\nThe Times reported in 2010 that the unfurnished, 8-foot-by-8-foot room was used for dealing with unruly children. But Jonathan\u2019s parents, Don and Tina King, said they never saw the room until his death.\n\nThe Kings filed a lawsuit in 2009, but a Hall County Superior Court judge and the Georgia Court of Appeals ruled there was not a case for a civil rights complaint against the school.\n\nAttempts to reach officials from the Futures Program or Pioneer RESA were not answered or returned last week.\n\nDyer said, however, the Alpine center was regularly monitored during her time as superintendent.\n\n\u201cNot because of that issue,\u201d Dyer said of the concerns regarding King\u2019s death at the center. \u201cIt was because of the focus on equity in psycho-ed centers. At the time, there were no issues noted there.\u201d\n\nThe justice department\u2019s investigation into GNETS did not address King\u2019s case, nor concerns regarding safety of these students, however. Instead, the investigation highlighted the inequality created by these segregated programs.\n\nThe report quoted one parent who said, \u201cGNETS is not an educational facility \u2014 it\u2019s where kids are sent to be babysat.\u201d\n\nSegregation vs. inclusion\n\nGNETS\u2019 argument for segregating students with behavioral disabilities is to prevent \u201cother more restrictive placements,\u201d such as permanent residential care.\n\nBut the justice department argues Georgia relies too heavily on these segregation methods.\n\nAmy Gates, executive director of Challenged Child and Friends in Gainesville, said she knows of few programs or schools in Georgia with an inclusion model, providing atypical students with the services they need alongside their typical peers.\n\n\u201cI found, coming from Connecticut, significantly less inclusion down here,\u201d said Gates, who joined Challenged Child and Friends last year. \u201cObviously, that\u2019s not a scientific study, but just what I\u2019ve run across. It\u2019s very different.\u201d\n\nChallenged Child and Friends is a full-inclusion program serving children 6 weeks old up to 6 years. It provides classroom education for typical children and those with disabilities together, and offers speech, occupational and physical therapy.\n\n\u201cPeople often assume that the benefit really lies with our kids with disabilities, and they do benefit and have strong social models,\u201d Gates said. \u201cTheir typical peers do teach them how to interact appropriately, their play skills, social skills and the things that come naturally to our typical peers.\u201d\n\nBut Gates said there are benefits for typical students as well, who learn tolerance, compassion and leadership from a young age.\n\n\u201cSo many of us didn\u2019t grow up that way,\u201d Gates said. \u201cWe grew up with kids with significant disabilities being secluded or just \u2018somewhere else.\u2019 But when you look at the prevalence of autism today especially, our kids are going to interact with someone who has autism at some point in their life.\u201d\n\nThe justice department\u2019s recommended remedy for GNETS begins with bringing services for students with disabilities back to the general education schools, in an \u201cintegrated setting appropriate to their needs.\u201d\n\nGates said parents of typically developing students who are wary of students with disabilities entering their child\u2019s classroom have little reason to fear the distraction they may pose.\n\n\u201cThere are legitimate fears for parents,\u201d Gates said. \u201cBut they\u2019re not based in any research.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.gainesvilletimes.com/archives/110950/", "image": "http://media.morristechnology.com/webmedia/facebook_share_images/gainesville/020216thetimesogimgoptimzed.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Each year, students with behavioral or psychological disabilities are sent from local public schools to the Futures Program.", "title": "State behavioral program serving Gainesville, Hall students under federal scrutiny"}, "twitter": {"site": "@gtimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "title": "State behavioral program serving Gainesville, Hall students under federal scrutiny"}, "article_summary": "The program and the problemDesigned to help local school districts serve students with severe behavioral and psychological disabilities, GNETS includes 24 programs throughout the state.\nUntil last May, the local program was housed in the Academy at Wood\u2019s Mill in Gainesville.\nThrough 2012, the Futures Program in Gainesville was known as an Alpine Psychoeducational Program center, where 13-year-old Jonathan King hanged himself while inside a \u201cseclusion room\u201d in 2004.\nStudents are referred by their local school district after documented evidence of the severity of their condition.\nThe program is funded through the organization Pioneer RESA, not by a local school district."}
