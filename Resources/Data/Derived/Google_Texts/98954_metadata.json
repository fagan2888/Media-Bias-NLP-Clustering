So if you\u2019re trying to elevate one specific part of the ruling as especially disconnected, you\u2019ve got a lot to work with. In fact, it\u2019s one of those questions for which there is no \u201cwrong\u201d answer.\n\nIf I had to choose just a single piece of the decision\u2019s underlying argument as the most unhinged, though, I\u2019d go with Justice Anthony Kennedy\u2019s assertion that \u201cindependent expenditures do not lead to, or create the appearance of, quid pro quo corruption.\u201d I\u2019ve written about this previously, so I\u2019ll try not to belabor the point. But the key thing here is that Kennedy isn\u2019t just saying super PACs don\u2019t corrupt. He\u2019s saying they don\u2019t even create the appearance of corruption.\n\nBecause guarding against even the mere appearance of corruption is seen as a legitimate and Constitutional government interest, Kennedy, if he wanted to make Citizens United stick, didn\u2019t have much of a choice but to argue as he did. Yet even if you give Kennedy \u201ccredit,\u201d in a sense, and assume his argument stemmed from Machiavellian cynicism rather than libertarian dogmatism, the idea is still self-evidently absurd. (And subsequent polling has confirmed it to be empirically wrong, as well.)\n\nAgain, Kennedy\u2019s is an especially radical view. That said, the general assumption that allows Kennedy to stray so far off the reservation \u2014 that economic inequality does not create political inequality \u2014 is widely accepted by conservative elites. A cursory knowledge of history and simple common sense should make you reject the idea out-of-hand. But if you need a real-world example of why economic and political power aren\u2019t so easily decoupled, look no further than a district court ruling that came out of Idaho earlier this week.\n\nThe case in question involved the liberal magazine Mother Jones and Frank VanderSloot, a GOP mega-donor (who, judging by his name, may also be a villain in a long-lost Charles Dickens story). You can read MoJo\u2019s recap of the case here, but the quick-and-dirty summary goes like this: In 2012, VanderSloot sued MoJo for defamation over a piece about his company\u2019s support for a pro-Romney super PAC that also happened to mention his history opposing gay rights. MoJo fought back. VanderSloot lost.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A GOP mega-donor's failed attempt to silence the press offers a view behind the curtain of America's new Gilded Age", "title": "Freedom, on the oligarchs\u2019 terms: What a billionaire\u2019s nuisance suit reveals about American plutocracy", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "A GOP mega-donor's failed attempt to silence the press offers a view behind the curtain of America's new Gilded Age", "title": "Freedom, on the oligarchs\u2019 terms: What a billionaire\u2019s nuisance suit reveals about American plutocracy", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/10/10/freedom_on_the_oligarchs_terms_what_a_billionaires_nuisance_suit_reveals_about_american_plutocracy/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/10/vandersloot_koch_adelson.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A GOP mega-donor's failed attempt to silence the press offers a view behind the curtain of America's new Gilded Age", "title": "Freedom, on the oligarchs\u2019 terms: What a billionaire\u2019s nuisance suit reveals about American plutocracy", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/10/vandersloot_koch_adelson.jpg", "creator": "@eliasisquith", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Elias Isquith", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 1 percent, Anthony Kennedy, aol_on, Citizens United, Editor's Picks, frank vandersloot, Inequality, Mitt Romney, Mother Jones, Plutocracy", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd152f\"", "article_summary": "So if you\u2019re trying to elevate one specific part of the ruling as especially disconnected, you\u2019ve got a lot to work with.\nBut the key thing here is that Kennedy isn\u2019t just saying super PACs don\u2019t corrupt.\nTopics: 1 percent, Anthony Kennedy, aol_on, Citizens United, Editor's Picks, frank vandersloot, Inequality, Mitt Romney, Mother Jones, Plutocracy, Media News, News, Politics NewsThe Supreme Court\u2019s Citizens United ruling is a consummately extreme and ideological document, the product of the Federalist Society mindset through and through.\nIn fact, it\u2019s one of those questions for which there is no \u201cwrong\u201d answer.\nHe\u2019s saying they don\u2019t even create the appearance of corruption."}
