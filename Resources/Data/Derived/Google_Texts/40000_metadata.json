She planned to highlight county projects and accomplishments over the past year, including a continued boost in spending on road upkeep, funding a slate of homelessness programs and opening up nearly 1,500 acres of county open space for public access.\n\nGoing forward, county officials voiced a hope to steer money toward key programs, instead of simply backfilling positions and budgets slashed during the recession. On that initial list of priorities are proposals to fund universal preschool, build new affordable housing and improve access to health care.\n\n\u201cThis is a direction Sonoma County is very consciously taking, by strategically targeting our investments,\u201d Gorin said. \u201cWe are not about building up a large county organization.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, county staffing has rebounded, with 4,187 total employees today \u2014 up 33 percent from 2011 after the county had cut its workforce by more than 500 filled and unfilled positions. Total spending on employee salaries and benefits was more than $550 million this year, up from $464 million in 2011.\n\nWith the additional tax revenue, this year\u2019s budget grew 7.4 percent over last year\u2019s. The current spending plan is up more than 20 percent from 2011 \u2014 the height of the economic downturn for county government.\n\nProperty tax revenue, the main source of county discretionary funding, shot up in 2014, with the county\u2019s overall tax assessment roll valued at $71.7 billion \u2014 more than a 7 percent annual increase, the largest since the financial collapse. The county\u2019s portion of the property tax revenues came in at $193.2 million in 2014, up 5.3 percent from the previous year, according to county financial reports.\n\nRevenue from hotel bed taxes also has increased. The latest calendar year numbers, from 2013, climbed 13 percent from the previous year\u2019s, for a total of $27 million in annual revenue. The rise continued during the first six months of 2014. Hotel occupancy rates are up more than 6 percent compared to this time last year, an economic indicator of tourism, county officials said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The financial outlook for Sonoma County government, clouded just three years ago", "story version": 2016, "og": {"site_name": "Santa Rosa Press Democrat", "description": "Tax revenue is up, tourism is at an all-time high and the unemployment rate is lower than the state and national average.", "title": "Sonoma County\u2019s financial outlook bright", "url": "http://www.pressdemocrat.com/news/3368616-181/sonoma-countys-financial-outlook-bright", "image": "http://www.pressdemocrat.com/csp/mediapool/sites/pressdemocrat/assets/img/logo/default.png", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100003031242373, "app_id": 125780984227497}, "msvalidate.01": "9E66801B649686495190ABE3DA8985E7", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressdemocrat", "published_time": "2015-01-21T21:33:00-08:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc67e\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThis is a direction Sonoma County is very consciously taking, by strategically targeting our investments,\u201d Gorin said.\nTotal spending on employee salaries and benefits was more than $550 million this year, up from $464 million in 2011.\nWith the additional tax revenue, this year\u2019s budget grew 7.4 percent over last year\u2019s.\nThe county\u2019s portion of the property tax revenues came in at $193.2 million in 2014, up 5.3 percent from the previous year, according to county financial reports.\nProperty tax revenue, the main source of county discretionary funding, shot up in 2014, with the county\u2019s overall tax assessment roll valued at $71.7 billion \u2014 more than a 7 percent annual increase, the largest since the financial collapse."}
