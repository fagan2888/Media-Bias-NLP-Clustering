In a new study published in the journal Appetite, researchers from the University of Arkansas shined some light on what can deter people from eating.\n\nResearchers studied the mindless eating reactions of 112 adults who were seated in private booths. Each booth was lit with a different color LED bulb of white, yellow, or blue light. After participants fasted overnight, they were served breakfast in one of the three colors. They were allowed to eat as much of the two ham and cheese omelets and eight mini pancakes as they wanted. Researchers then weighed their food and had participants fill out surveys rating the food's flavor, fullness, and overall satiety. Guess who felt full and ate least? Men served under a blue light.\n\nThe best diet is the one you don\u2019t know you\u2019re on, and if discouraging bad food selections by shining a blue light on it works, then shine on. \u201cSince naturally blue-colored foods are rare, humans may have a doubt as to whether (such foods) are safe to eat,\u201d the researchers wrote in their study. Colors such as red, yellow, and orange tell the brain to eat on, while blue may remind them of something poisonous or sterile.\n\n\u201cBlue lighting can decrease the amount of food eaten by men, without reducing the acceptability of the food,\u201d the study\u2019s lead author Han-Seok Seo, said in a press release. However, women weren\u2019t affected, and Seo said he and his colleagues believe it has to do with \u201cwomen\u2019s superiority in detecting, discriminating, identifying, and remembering odor cues.\u201d\n\nPainting your kitchen blue or eating off of blue plates would be easy ways to manipulating the brain into eating less. It may not work for women because they \u201care expected to more easily identify whether or not the served meal is safe to eat, regardless of the lighting color under which it is presented,\u201d the researchers wrote. Perhaps using other tricks such as eating on smaller plates or eating buffet style at home would be a helpful way to discourage overeating, according to Brian Wansink, Cornell University marketing and nutritional science professor and author of Mindless Eating.\n\nWe mindlessly overeat because of family and friends, environmental cues, certain packaging, plates, labels, names, colors, and lights, according to the Food and Brand Lab at Cornell University. Most people don\u2019t overeat because they\u2019re hungry but because they\u2019ve been subconsciously cued to. What if the solution to the obesity crisis could be as mindless as the reason there is one? By manipulating the brain with different cues, such as the color blue, researchers will be able to change what we eat and just how much.\n\nSource: Seo SH, Cho S, Han A, Taylor MH, Huck AC, and Mishler AM, et al.
