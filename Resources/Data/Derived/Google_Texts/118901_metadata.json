The estimate was $4,600.\n\nLilly then bought insurance from Progressive on March 24 and claimed the damage on March 28, said Nancy Kincaid, a spokeswoman for the agency.\n\n\u201cWhat a lot of people may not realize is that body shops often enter estimates into a database that insurance companies can check to verify claims,\u201d Kincaid told the Tribune. \u201cThey can see what the damage was and whether a false claim may have been filed.\u201d\n\nThe three felony charges, filed Oct. 24, are filing a false insurance claim, filing a false statement in connection with an insurance claim, and concealing a material fact in connection with an insurance claim. The case is being prosecuted by the district attorney\u2019s office in San Luis Obispo County, where Lilly lives.\n\nHis lawyer, James Murphy, didn\u2019t return a call for comment.\n\nLilly faces a maximum penalty of five years in jail if he\u2019s convicted, the newspaper said. He\u2019s scheduled for arraignment on Feb. 5. Three previous court hearings were postponed.\n\nThe 39-year-old left-hander was a two-time All-Star who pitched for Montreal, Oakland, Toronto, the New York Yankees, Chicago Cubs and the Dodgers.\n\nHe retired in 2013 after 15 seasons because of problems with his shoulder and back.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Ex-Major League Baseball player Ted Lilly accused of fraud", "title": "Ex-Major League Baseball player Ted Lilly accused of fraud", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/01/24/ex-major-league-baseball-player-ted-lilly-accused-of-fraud/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150124_122749_ted-lilly.jpg", "height": 460}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150124_122749_ted-lilly.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-24T12:26:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T03:17:34+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd37bf\"", "article_summary": "SAN LUIS OBISPO, Calif. \u2014 Former Major League Baseball player Ted Lilly has been charged in California with three felonies related to insurance fraud, according to a newspaper report.\nThe case is being prosecuted by the district attorney\u2019s office in San Luis Obispo County, where Lilly lives.\nThe charges stem from allegedly false insurance claims filed last year connected to Lilly\u2019s damaged recreational vehicle, the San Luis Obispo Tribune reported Friday.\n\u201cThey can see what the damage was and whether a false claim may have been filed.\u201dThe three felony charges, filed Oct. 24, are filing a false insurance claim, filing a false statement in connection with an insurance claim, and concealing a material fact in connection with an insurance claim.\nLilly then bought insurance from Progressive on March 24 and claimed the damage on March 28, said Nancy Kincaid, a spokeswoman for the agency."}
