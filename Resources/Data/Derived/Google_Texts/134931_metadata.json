Greg Juarez arrived to provide cover, he also searched Vigil and then transported him in a police cruiser to the District 4 substation at 2100 S. Clay St. in southwest Denver.\n\nDuring the arrest and the ride, the document states that Vigil made several comments to detectives and officers that he was going to shoot them, saying, \u201cI\u2019ve got something for you guys.\u201d He also admitted to police on the drive that he had been smoking meth for three days and was not going back to prison, saying he preferred to die.\n\nThe document also says Vigil was kicking the doors and windows of the police vehicle.\n\nWhen they arrived at the station, Vigil refused to get out of the vehicle, so Juarez asked another officer for help.\n\nAs the other officer helped to get Vigil out, police saw a flash as Vigil fired a gun from behind his back.\n\nOfficers took cover behind the police car and heard a second shot fired.\n\nAnother officer, Cpl. John Sisneros, then fired one shot at Vigil, hitting him in the abdomen.\n\nPolice used a shield to approach the vehicle again and take the wounded suspect out of the car.\n\nThe document also reveals that police recovered a handgun with a scratched-off serial number from the back of the police car, and paramedics retrieved three bags of meth from inside Vigil\u2019s body.\n\nAs of Friday afternoon, Vigil was still in a hospital being treated for the gunshot wound.\n\nThe probable cause document was first reported by CBS4.\n\nYesenia Robles: 303-954-1372, yrobles@denverpost.com or twitter.com/yeseniarobles", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Denver Police arrest document describes two searches before man opened fire", "title": "Denver Police arrest document describes two searches before man opened fire", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/05/16/denver-police-arrest-document-describes-two-searches-before-man-opened-fire/", "image": {"width": 480, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140514__SuspectIsaacVigilp1-6.jpg", "height": 600}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140514__SuspectIsaacVigilp1-6.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-05-16T18:16:51+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T19:28:42+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9cba\"", "article_summary": "Greg Juarez arrived to provide cover, he also searched Vigil and then transported him in a police cruiser to the District 4 substation at 2100 S.
