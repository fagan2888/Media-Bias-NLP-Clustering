It made premiums more affordable for people with chronic health conditions that are expensive to treat \u2014 but at the price of sticking them with unaffordable co-payments for their medications.\n\nThe nonprofit AIDS Institute is suing four Florida health insurers for discriminating against HIV/AIDS patients. The complaint says these patients now face prohibitive out-of-pocket drug costs. Sadly, most of the plans sold via ObamaCare all across the country have similar problems \u2014 leaving those with chronic diseases without affordable access to the specialty drugs they need.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act limits the degree to which insurers can charge higher premiums for sicker patients. But ObamaCare plans found a way around these rules: impose higher out-of-pocket costs for all or most specialty drugs.\n\nConsider the Florida suit. Carl Schmid, the AIDS Institute deputy executive director, says the plans follow a \u201cpattern where every single [HIV/AIDS] drug for some plans was on the highest tier, including generics.\u201d Under these policies, drug costs for AIDS patients can exceed $1,000 a month.\n\nAnd Florida\u2019s hardly unusual. A new report from consulting group Avalere Health found that a large majority of all ObamaCare exchange plans include similarly high out-of-pocket costs for patients with certain illnesses.\n\nThe breakdown of Silver plans (the most popular category) is particularly revealing. In seven classes of drugs for conditions from cancer to bipolar disorder, more than a fifth of these plans require patients to shoulder 40 percent of the medicine\u2019s cost.\n\nAnd 60 percent of Silver plans place all drugs for illnesses like multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis in the \u201cformulary tier\u201d with the highest level of cost-sharing.\n\nNearly every Silver plan across the country, in fact, puts at least one class of drug exclusively in the top cost-sharing tier. In effect, this leaves patients with a given condition \u2014 whether HIV or Crohn\u2019s disease \u2014 without a single affordable treatment option.\n\nPre-ObamaCare, about half the states had a system in place for helping people with pre-existing conditions: state high-risk pool plans, which for years offered government-subsidized coverage to patients with pre-existing conditions. But the Affordable Care Act banned those pools.\n\nSo now, with exchange plans failing them, the chronically ill have nowhere left to go.\n\nAllies of the insurance industry blame the drug companies for the high price of certain medicines. AARP policy adviser Leigh Purvis, for instance, says cost-sharing levels \u201cwouldn\u2019t be so high if the prices of drugs weren\u2019t so high.\u201d Health-policy advocate John Rother, meanwhile, claims that \u201creducing price is something [drug] companies could do tomorrow.\u201d\n\nBut drug prices aren\u2019t arbitrary. The average biopharmaceutical therapy takes $1.2 billion and anywhere from 10 to 15 years to bring to market. Firms must charge high prices for certain brand-name drugs to make back this substantial investment with enough left over to fund research into the next generation of treatments.\n\nAnd while insurers like to complain that sophisticated therapies cost too much, they tend to ignore the far higher costs of denying these medicines to patients.\n\nIncreased co-pays result in \u201cnonadherence,\u201d failure to take prescribed medications. And that equals increased rates of hospitalization, chronic heart failure and premature death.\n\nAnd this adds to health outlays: According to a recent study in the Annals of Internal Medicine, nonadherence costs the US health system from $100 billion to $289 billion a year.\n\nIn short, by making needed medications unaffordable \u2014 and by failing to cover newer, targeted therapies \u2014 insurers are jeopardizing patient health. And far from saving money, cutting off access to specialty drugs actually increases long-term health costs.\n\nSpecialty medications need to be treated as equivalent to other essential medical services \u2014 not as some luxury that only the wealthy can afford. But the ObamaCare law has only made the problem worse than ever.\n\nPeter J.
