Story highlights Jeb Bush says "hell yeah" he'd time travel to kill baby Hitler, given the chance

Bush was asked the question by The Huffington Post

Washington (CNN) Given the opportunity, Jeb Bush says he'd go back in time and kill baby Hitler.

"Hell yeah, I would!" the former Florida governor told The Huffington Post . "You gotta step up, man."

Bush said he knows there's no way to predict how the course of human history would change -- and whether World War II could have been avoided -- had the eventual German dictator never escaped infancy.

"It could have a dangerous effect on everything else, but I'd do it -- I mean, Hitler," Bush said.
