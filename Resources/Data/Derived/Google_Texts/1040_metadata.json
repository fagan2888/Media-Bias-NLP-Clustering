An increasing number of hospitals that serve large numbers of poor and uninsured Americans are being forced to close in states that are refusing the Affordable Care Act\u2019s Medicaid expansion.\n\nThe Lower Oconee Community Hospital, a so-called \u201ccritical access\u201d hospital in southeastern Georgia with 25 beds, will close down and possibly re-open as an urgent care center that provides services that aren\u2019t quite serious enough to necessitate an emergency room visit. Patients in the Wheeler County region who need more extensive medical care after the hospital closes will need to travel upwards of thirty miles in order to receive it.\n\n\u201cWe just did not have sufficient volume to support the expenses,\u201d said CEO Karen O\u2019Neal in an interview with local CBS affiliate WMAZ. \u201cIt\u2019s a terrible situation, and it\u2019s tragic, the loss of jobs and the economic impact.\u201d\n\nLast fall, Bloomberg reported that at least five public hospitals in Georgia, North Carolina, and Virginia \u2014 including three in Georgia alone \u2014 were cutting staff and services in the wake of their refusal to expand Medicaid. These hospitals are so-called \u201cDisproportionate Share Hospitals\u201d \u2014 providers that serve a disproportionate number of poor and uninsured Americans, and as such don\u2019t always receive payments for the care they give patients.\n\nAbout one in four people in Wheeler County, where the latest hospital is shutting down, is uninsured. About one in ten residents are unemployed and over 40 percent of children live in poverty.\n\nAs the Albany Herald reports, experts agree that offering higher Medicaid reimbursement rates for rural hospitals and accepting Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion, which would extend health benefits to all Americans who make up to 138 percent of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL), would provide major financial security to hospitals in lower-income regions.\n\nApproximately five million working poor Americans who live in states refusing Obamcare\u2019s Medicaid expansion will fall into a coverage gap where they make too much money to qualify for existing state Medicaid programs but too little money to qualify for the ACA\u2019s insurance subsidies.
