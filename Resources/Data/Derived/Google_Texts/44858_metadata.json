Specifically, officials warned that programmers in Belarus, a former Soviet republic closely allied with Russia, were suspected of inserting malicious code that could be used for cyber attacks, according to U.S. officials familiar with the concerns.\n\nThe software links the millions of Americans who signed up for Obamacare to the federal government and more than 300 medical institutions and healthcare providers.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. Affordable Care Act software was written in part in Belarus by software developers under state control, and that makes the software a potential target for cyber attacks,\u201d one official said.\n\nCyber security officials said the potential threat to the U.S. healthcare data is compounded by what they said was an Internet data \u201chijacking\u201d last year involving Belarusian state-controlled networks. The month-long diversion covertly rerouted massive amounts of U.S. Internet traffic to Belarus\u2014a repressive dictatorship located between Russia, Poland, and Ukraine.\n\n\u201cBelarusian President [Alexander] Lukashenko\u2019s authoritarian regime is closely allied with Russia and is adversarial toward the United States,\u201d the official added.\n\nThe combination of the Belarus-origin software, the Internet re-routing, and the anti-U.S. posture of the Belarusian government \u201cmakes the software written in Belarus a potential target of cyber attacks for identity theft and privacy violations\u201d of Americans, the official said.\n\nSecurity officials urged HHS to immediately conduct inspections of the network software for malicious code. The software currently is used in all medical facilities and insurance companies in the United States.\n\nThe officials also recommended that HHS use security specialists not related to software vendors for the inspections to reduce further risks.\n\nOfficials disclosed the software compromise last week after the discovery in early January of statements by Belarusian official Valery Tsepkalo, director of the government-backed High-Technology Park (HTP) in Minsk.\n\nTsepkalo told a Russian radio station in an interview broadcast last summer that HHS is \u201cone of our clients,\u201d and that \u201cwe are helping Obama complete his insurance reform.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur programmers wrote the program that appears on the monitors in all hospitals and all insurance companies\u2014they will see the full profile of the given patient,\u201d Tsepkalo said June 25 on Voice of Russia Radio.\n\nWhite House National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said an intelligence report on the Belarusian software was \u201crecalled by the intelligence community shortly after it was issued.\u201d\n\nThe report has prompted HHS to conduct a review to determine if software related to the Affordable Care Act \u201cwas written by Belarusian software developers,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cSo far HHS has found no indications that any software was developed in Belarus,\u201d Hayden said. \u201cHowever, as a matter of due diligence, they will continue to review the supply chain. Supply chain risk is real and it is one of our top concerns in the area of cyber-security.\u201d\n\nA senior administration official questioned whether suspect software mentioned in the report would be valuable to a nation state.\n\n\u201cNation states are generally not interested in [personal identification information] for its own sake,\u201d the official said. \u201cGiven that, we would be surprised to see a nation-state capability applied in this matter. But we are doing a thorough review anyway.\u201d\n\nHSS spokeswoman Dori Salcido referred questions about the matter to Richard A. Olague, spokesman for the HHS\u2019 Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). Olague declined to discuss the software vulnerability.\n\nHe also would not say if CMS is conducting a search for malicious software emanating from Belarus.\n\nCMS said in a statement to the Washington Free Beacon that assessments by independent security contractors are conducted regularly by companies such as MITRE and Blue Canopy.\n\nThe website also is continuously monitored by CMS technicians and electronic sensors, and weekly penetration tests to check the security of the system are carried out.\n\nA CMS security team in place also seeks to \u201cidentify anomalous activity, and to deter and prevent any unauthorized access,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\u201cIn addition, as new website functions continue to go live, CMS follows a rigorous and regular change management process with ongoing testing and mitigation strategies implemented in real time,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThis occurs on a regular basis, in between the [source code analysis] testing periods.\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman for CGI Federal, the main federal contractor for the healthcare network, also had no immediate comment.\n\nIntel chair calls for probe\n\nHouse Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence Chairman Rep. Mike Rogers (R., Mich) said he was surprised by media reports from Belarus indicating \u201csome parts of Healthcare.gov or systems connected to it may have in fact been written overseas.\u201d He called for an independent security review of the Obamacare website.\n\nRogers said he was especially concerned by the potential software vulnerability because a CGI executive, Vice President Cheryl Campbell, testified to Congress that all software work for the network had been done in the United States.\n\n\u201cWe need an independent, thorough security evaluation of this site, and we need the commitment from the administration that the findings will be acknowledged and promptly addressed,\u201d Rogers told the Free Beacon.\n\n\u201cI continue to call on HHS to shut down and properly stress test the site to ensure that consumers are protected from potential security risks from across the globe.\u201d\n\nDetails of the software work done by Belarusians could not be learned. Tsepkalo could not be reached for comment and did not respond to emails sent to his technology park website.\n\nThe company involved in the software was identified as EPAM, a Belarusian firm with U.S. offices and international clients that conducts programming work in Belarus.\n\nA company representative denied any involvement in the software development.\n\n\u201cEPAM is not now and has never been involved in software development for the Healthcare.gov website. Any claim to the contrary is completely false,\u201d said Ginger Mosier, EPAM general counsel.\n\nThe officials said there are serious concerns that the Belarusian software contains malicious code that could be used to covertly route data from the Obamacare website to foreign locations.\n\nAdditionally, they suspect the Belarusians planted secret \u201cbackdoor\u201d openings to the software that will permit surreptitious entry to U.S. government networks by hackers or spies.\n\nThe malicious code could reroute Obamacare website data to Belarus, or possibly permit illegal backdoor access to the Healthcare.gov networks and other government and health industry networks, the officials said.\n\nThe security vulnerability could provide \u201caccess to all necessary personal information of U.S. residents for identity theft and privacy violations,\u201d said one official.\n\nSoftware security issue follows website problems\n\nDisclosure of cyber attack vulnerabilities follows months of software problems with the Healthcare.gov rollout that began Oct. 1. The troublesome software cost the government more than $400 million. The government spent several months attempting to repair the software.\n\nThe software problems prevented hundreds of thousands of people from obtaining health coverage and undermined confidence in the government-run health care system.\n\nPresident Barack Obama said on Sunday that \u201cglitches\u201d with the Obamacare website were expected but \u201cI don\u2019t think I anticipated or anybody anticipated the degree of the problems with the website.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe good news is that right away we decided how we were going to fix it. It got fixed,\u201d Obama said.\n\nObama said three million people signed up through the website after delays of a month and half.\n\n\u201cNow it\u2019s working the way it\u2019s supposed to and we\u2019ve signed up three million people,\u201d the president said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re constantly figuring out is how do we continue to improve it?\u201d\n\nAccording to HHS, between Oct. 1 and the end of the year, 1. 9 million people signed up for healthcare through the federal website. Another 956,000 enrolled through state websites. More than 55 million people visited both the federal and state websites.\n\nThe threat of data diversion is compounded by the discovery last year that Belarus covertly diverted massive amounts of U.S. Internet traffic to Belarus.\n\nAccording to the New Hampshire-based security firm Renesys, which discovered the data diversion, throughout February 2013, Internet traffic from the United States was sent to Belarus. The purpose likely was to allow hackers or government agencies to sift for data for financial, economic, or government intelligence.\n\nThe data also may have been modified for other purposes before being returned to the original U.S. and other foreign destinations.\n\nThe bulk diversion technique is called border gateway protocol hijacking. It involves using a series of network addresses to mask the data diversion through numerous Internet hubs around the world.\n\nRenesys traced the data diversion from Washington to New York and Moscow and finally to Minsk, the Belarusian capital. It was returned to the United States via connections in Moscow, Frankfurt, and New York.\n\nInternet diversion linked to state telecom\n\nU.S. officials believe the Belarus state-controlled telecommunications provider Beltelecom took part in the Internet data hijacking last year. The company operates fiber optic networks and controls all Belarus Internet traffic and infrastructure. Technical evidence in the diversion revealed that the hijacking was intentional and not the result of mistakes by network operators.\n\n\u201cBeltelecom has a chance to examine the traffic, and then sends it back out on the \u2018clean path\u2019 through Russian provider ReTN,\u201d Renesys\u2019 Jim Cowie said in a report on the incident.\n\n\u201cVictims whose traffic was diverted varied by day, and included major financial institutions, governments, and network service providers,\u201d the report said, noting that among the countries affected were the United States, South Korea, Germany, the Czech Republic, and Lithuania.\n\nAccording to the officials, the diversion allowed American\u2019s Internet activities to be viewed in Minsk.\n\nU.S. officials said a future hijack of U.S. Internet traffic to Belarus combined with malicious software implanted in Belarus would increase the damage of a cyber attack.\n\nRegarding the Belarusian official who disclosed his country\u2019s involvement in the Obamacare software, U.S. officials said Tsepkalo is a former Belarusian ambassador to the United States and held several high-level posts in the Lukashenko government. He also was a former Soviet foreign ministry official.\n\nTsepkalo is said to maintain close ties to Russia and in May 2012 he signed a cooperation agreement with Novosibirsk Technopark, a Russian high-technology enclave located in the Far East north of Kazakhstan.\n\nRogers warned last year that security vulnerabilities in the healthcare website make it a \u201cmagnet\u201d for hackers and foreign intelligence services.\n\nRogers stated in October that a component of the health insurance exchanges called the Federal Data Services Hub, created under Obamacare, is vulnerable to cyber attack and that the hub connects seven different agencies.\n\n\u201cSocial Security numbers, employment information, birth dates, health records and tax returns are among the personal data that will be transmitted to this hub, consolidating an unprecedented amount of information,\u201d Rogers stated in an op-ed in USA Today Oct. 10.\n\n\u201cEvery shred of data one would need to steal your identity or access your confidential credit information would be available at the fingertips of a skilled hacker, producing a staggering security threat,\u201d he said.\n\nThe hub \u201cwill be a magnet for hackers, creating inherent vulnerability and risk by connecting these seven interfaces,\u201d he said, adding that security vulnerabilities are \u201ca dream of faceless international hackers and hostile foreign intelligence services.\u201d\n\nBelarus software not raised during Hill probes\n\nThe website vulnerability to cyber attack from Belarus, a former Soviet republic, was not raised during several congressional hearings over the past several months on the problems with Healthcare.gov.\n\nKevin Charest, chief information technology officers at HHS, told the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee earlier this month that numerous cyber attacks against the website were investigated. \u201cTo date, there have been no successful security attacks on Healthcare.gov and no person or group has maliciously accessed personally-identifiable information (PII) from the site,\u201d he said Jan. 16.\n\nCommittee Chairman Rep. Darrell Issa (R., Calif.) said at the hearing that his committee obtained HHS documents revealing shortcomings in security testing of the website prior to the Oct. 1 launch.\n\n\u201cWhen Americans submit their sensitive personal information to Healthcare.gov\u2014or, I might add, when government takes sensitive information, including your IRS information and makes it available through a Website to outsiders\u2014they deserve to know that it is safe from hackers, bad actors, and security glitches,\u201d Issa said before a closed hearing by the committee.\n\n\u201cThe possibility of security breach is not some vague, distant concern. It is a real and tangible threat that could affect millions,\u201d he added.\n\nIssa said HHS officials repeatedly have said personal data submitted on the website is safe. \u201cBut because officials authorized the launch of the website full of functional errors, Americans have deep skepticism that the site was in fact secure,\u201d he said.\n\nThe components the Healthcare.gov website, involving government agencies, hospitals and insurance firms, were put together by the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\nIn testimony before a House committee Oct. 24, Cheryl Campbell, the CGI Federal vice president, said developing the federal healthcare system, known as the exchange, involved 55 contractors, five government agencies, 36 states, and more than 300 insurance firms.\n\nCGI calls its healthcare system software the Federally Facilitated Marketplace, or FFM. The application manages the web portal, a transaction processor and a business analytics functions. It links insurers to consumers.\n\nThe exchange has six complex systems, Campbell said.\n\nDavid Kennedy, head of the security firm TrustedSec, said the Obamacare website was not designed well and has \u201ca lot of security flaws.\u201d\n\nOne major concern is that the system connects the healthcare network to other sensitive U.S. government networks, including the Internal Revenue Service and the Department of Homeland Security.\n\n\u201cThat makes it a treasure trove for hackers,\u201d Kennedy said in an interview, adding that a major concern would be cyber attacks from sophisticated state-sponsored adversaries.\n\nThe threat of \u201cbackdoor\u201d access points is a particular worry. The Chinese military-linked Huawei Technologies is suspected of using that technique in its network equipment, Kennedy said.\n\nHHS technology officials recently contacted him about the security vulnerabilities and indicated the department is interested in taking measures to mitigate the security flaws.\n\nThe human rights organization Freedom House describes Belarus as a dictatorship with few freedoms.\n\nIn a report last year on Internet freedom, Freedom House said the state-run Beltelecom and the National Center for Traffic Exchange are \u201cthe only entities with the ability to handle connections with [Internet service providers] outside of Belarus.\u201d\n\n\u201cBeltelecom also holds a monopoly on fixed-line communications and internet services inside Belarus,\u201d it said, adding, \u201call ISPs depend on the facilities of the state-owned Beltelecom, which allows the authorities to control access speeds for the entire country, if needed.\u201d\n\nBelarus\u2019 Ministry of Communications and Information Technology and the presidential administration\u2019s Operational and Analytical Center control ISPs, \u201cconduct overseas online surveillance, and manage Belarus\u2019 top-level domain.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obamacare network vulnerable to cyber attack", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "U.S. intelligence agencies last week urged the Obama administration to check its new healthcare network for malicious software after learning that developers linked to the Belarus government helped pr", "title": "The Belarusian Connection", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/national-security/the-belarusian-connection/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Lukashenko-Putin-150x150.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "U.S. intelligence agencies last week urged the Obama administration to check its new healthcare netw", "creator": "@BillGertz", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Lukashenko-Putin-150x150.jpg", "title": "The Belarusian Connection", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccdde\"", "article_summary": "Cyber security officials said the potential threat to the U.S. healthcare data is compounded by what they said was an Internet data \u201chijacking\u201d last year involving Belarusian state-controlled networks.\nRegarding the Belarusian official who disclosed his country\u2019s involvement in the Obamacare software, U.S. officials said Tsepkalo is a former Belarusian ambassador to the United States and held several high-level posts in the Lukashenko government.\nSecurity officials urged HHS to immediately conduct inspections of the network software for malicious code.\n\u201cBelarusian President [Alexander] Lukashenko\u2019s authoritarian regime is closely allied with Russia and is adversarial toward the United States,\u201d the official added.\nRenesys traced the data diversion from Washington to New York and Moscow and finally to Minsk, the Belarusian capital."}
