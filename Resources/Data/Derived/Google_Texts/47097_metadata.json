The website crashed when Twitter first launched, has that failed? This week, I have also heard Republicans say that the government cannot run a health care plan. Have they ever heard of Medicare? Have any of them ever given their Medicare back?\n\nYesterday, when the new job numbers came out showing 148,000 jobs created, short of the 180,000 expected, Republicans said the president cared too much about health care and the failed website to create jobs. These are the same Republicans who shut our government down, halting new employment in both the public and the private sector in September. These are the same Republicans who promised the American people that if you voted for them, they would create jobs; instead we saw these Republicans obsess over Obamacare and shut our government down, as well as threaten to let our country default on it's debts by nearly not lifting the debt ceiling.\n\n[See a collection of political cartoons on the Republican Party.]\n\nAnd today we also watched another community bury a loved one ... a beloved teacher and the 12-year-old child who shot him. The teacher is being hailed a hero for trying to get that little boy to put down his gun, giving time for schoolchildren to escape. The first responders are also being hailed as heroes for responding within three minutes of the 911 call to the scene and taking care of the crisis within minutes of their arrival.\n\nAnd the dead 12-year-old boy? We do not know why he shot his teacher, his classmates and himself, but we do know he got the gun and the bullets from his own home, his own parents. And yet Republicans continue to ask for cuts to education, cuts to teacher's pay, cuts to first responder's pay and benefits. These same Republicans vote against universal background checks and continue to ignore America's need for gun control.\n\nAnd that was just this week. Next week, they applaud cuts to Food Stamps, a program that makes up a tiny percentage of our federal budget. A program that helps so many in need feed their families and themselves.\n\nWhat will Republicans do for an encore? I fear that for myself and for my fellow Americans. Stay tuned.\n\nRead Susan Milligan: The AP Was Wrong to Fire a Reporter Over False Terry McAuliffe Story\n\nRead Robert Schlesinger: Ted Cruz Defends the Government Shutdown as a Win", "article_metadata": {"zone": "leslie-marshall/blogentries", "keyword": "Politics [News]", "title": "Republicans Ignore Facts on Obamacare, Jobs and the Nevada School Shooting", "og": {"url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/leslie-marshall/2013/10/23/republicans-ignore-facts-on-obamacare-jobs-and-the-nevada-school-shooting", "type": "article", "site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "The party is avoiding the facts on Obamacare, gun policy and the economy.", "title": "The GOP's Alternative Reality"}, "twitter": {"title": "Republicans Ignore Facts on Obamacare, Jobs and the Nevada School Shooting", "description": "The party is avoiding the facts on Obamacare, gun policy and the economy.", "card": "summary", "site": "@USNews"}, "site": "opinion", "date_published": "Oct. 23, 2013", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Leslie Marshall,Republican Party,politics,Affordable Care Act,gun control and gun rights,Politics [News]", "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "The party is avoiding the facts on Obamacare, gun policy and the economy."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd744\"", "article_summary": "This week, we hear Republicans say that the Affordable Care Act has failed, because the website crashed.\nAnd yet Republicans continue to ask for cuts to education, cuts to teacher's pay, cuts to first responder's pay and benefits.\nYesterday, when the new job numbers came out showing 148,000 jobs created, short of the 180,000 expected, Republicans said the president cared too much about health care and the failed website to create jobs.\nThis week, I have also heard Republicans say that the government cannot run a health care plan.\nThese are the same Republicans who shut our government down, halting new employment in both the public and the private sector in September."}
