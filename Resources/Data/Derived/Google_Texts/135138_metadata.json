Paul LePage going to \u201cmeet his maker\u201d refused to step down.\n\nWestbrook city councilors voted on a resolution Monday night expressing their disappointment with comments made by Paul Emery at a recent town hall meeting.\n\nAt a meeting last week, Emery reportedly said, \u201cIf [LePage] goes to meet his maker it wouldn\u2019t hurt my feelings a bit.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe action that we took tonight saddens me. It was absolutely necessary but it saddens me,\u201d said Brendan Rielly, head of the council.\n\nCouncilors voted 6-1 in favor of a resolution urging Emery to resign.\n\n\u201cWhat Councilor Emery did this past Tuesday evening is unacceptable. The council strongly urges Councilor Emery to examine in light of these recent events whether his continued service on the city council is in the community\u2019s best interest,\u201d said Rielly.\n\nEmery said despite the vote, he is not planning on stepping down. Emery also made a brief statement reiterating his public apology.\n\n\u201cI made certain statements. Those statements are sincere. That is my comment,\u201d he said.\n\nOne of his constituents who spoke out during the meeting said Emery should go.\n\n\u201cI support Councilor Emery\u2019s right to speak and say whatever he wants to say,\u201d said Tony Bessey of Westbrook. \u201cI\u2019m just embarrassed for him at not seeing the consequences for his city and the people he represents.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "WESTBROOK, Maine \u2014 Even after being urged to resign, a Westbrook city councilor who made reference to Gov.
