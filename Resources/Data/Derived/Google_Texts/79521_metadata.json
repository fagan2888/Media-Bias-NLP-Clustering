How can someone oppose family planning because a pill or IUD might have the rare and unintended consequence of interfering with implantation, and then endorse beating a child, which might have the rare and unintended consequence of battering her to death?\n\nThese two positions fit together seamlessly only when we understand the Iron Age view of the child imbedded throughout the Bible, and how that view has shaped the priorities and behavior of biblical literalists.\n\nExtreme Biblical Parenting\n\nIn 2014, Pentecostal parents Herbert and Catherine Schaible went to jail after a second of their nine children died from easily treatable bacterial pneumonia. The Schaibles belong to a sect that relies on prayer for physical as well as spiritual healing. In a police statement, Herbert Schiable explained that medicine \u201cis against our religious beliefs.\u201d Sects like their point to the New Testament books of Matthew and Mark, which both say that devout believers can pray for anything in faith and God will grant their request (Mark 11:24 and Matthew 21:22). All that is required, according to the writer of Matthew, is faith the size of a tiny mustard seed. The Schaible\u2019s pastor blamed the deaths of the two children on a \u201cspiritual lack\u201d in the parents.\n\nMost devout Bible believers turn to science when their children can\u2019t breathe, but 38 US states have now passed laws to protect parents who don\u2019t\u2014along with parents who beat their children in accordance with biblical advice, or deny them education on religious grounds.\n\nThe Schaible case is a chilling example of how these laws work. In 2009, the Schaible\u2019s two year old son, Kent, died of pneumonia after having his illness treated by prayer alone. Under Pennsylvania\u2019s faith-healing exemption both parents were allowed to plead guilty to lesser charges. The result was a sentence of probation; and after agreeing to seek medical care for their children in future, the Schaibles were allowed to keep custody of their other kids. But In 2014 the Grim Reaper struck again in the form of another untreated infection. This time, the couple was jailed after 8 month old Brandon died. The parents were sent to prison, not for killing a child, but for violating the terms of their earlier probation.\n\nRepublicans Double Down on Protecting Parents over Children\n\nIn spite of similar tragedies around the country, legislators in multiple states are looking to expand laws that exempt parents like the Schaibles from criminal charges. Georgia recently introduced legislation that appears to offer legal cover to parents who beat their children (and men who beat their wives) for religious reasons. In Idaho, despite more than a dozen child deaths linked to one small sect called the Followers of Christ, Republican state legislators introduced a bill in February granting parents broader leeway to harm children\u2014as long as their motives are religious. The bill secures faith healing exemptions from medical neglect laws; reduces the court\u2019s power to protect abused children; discourages doctors and teachers from reporting suspected abuse; and excuses religious parents from education requirements that otherwise apply to Idaho residents. On March 23, 2015, it passed the Idaho Senate 27-7, along straight party lines.\n\nIn 2011, after a series of child deaths from medical neglect, Oregon\u2019s Democratic governor took the opposite tack, stripping faith-healing parents of legal protection from criminal charges. Oregon children stopped dying, but some extreme families moved to Idaho. In the words of law professor Marci Hamilton, \u201cIdaho has become a haven for parents who martyr their children for their faith.\u201d\n\nEmboldened by Hobby Lobby\n\nSince the Supreme Court\u2019s 2014 Hobby Lobby decision, conservative Christians in the U.S. are testing \u201creligious freedom\u201d claims as a means to opt out of a wide array of rules and responsibilities that otherwise apply to all Americans. Much of the focus has been on exemption from reproductive healthcare, queer equality rights, and finances (what churches give and get when it comes to public funds and services.) But exemption from child rights and protections should be thought of as a fourth leg of the \u201creligious freedom\u201d agenda.\n\nDevout Bible believers regularly oppose child protective services, insisting that the right of religious adults to do as they choose trumps the right of children to be free from harm. Evangelical Christian leaders fought the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, making the U.S. one of two countries (along with Somalia) that failed to endorse it. In some U.S. locales, like the State of Virginia, they have sought and won the right to deny children basic education, including the ability to read and write.\n\nThe Embryo Anomaly\n\nBut while conservative Bible believers look bent on depriving born children of any and all human rights, they simultaneously claim that every fertilized egg merits protection. Ignoring the fact that most fertilized eggs, when left alone, simply diebefore implanting or else self-abort, believers oppose stem cell research, abortion and even contraception that might harm embryonic human life.\n\nThe Religious Right\u2019s extreme devotion to embryonic life was on display in a recent bill aimed at protecting women and children from sex trafficking. Conservative Republicans inserted language that would deny abortion care funding to young girls who got pregnant after being coerced into sexual slavery, forcing them instead to carry pregnancies and give birth.\n\nTo a person imbued with modern secular ethics, such priorities may be immoral; but in the Iron Age worldview of the Bible writers and fundamentalist believers, they actually make sense.\n\nA Modern View of Childhood\n\nModern secularists think of children as persons with rights based on their capacity to suffer and feel pleasure, to love and be loved, to be aware and self-aware, to have preferences and intentions that are expressed via decisions and actions, and to have dreams and goals that place a value on their own future. These capacities, which make human life uniquely precious, emerge gradually during childhood, which is why children can\u2019t take care of themselves. Parents are thought of as custodians, who have both rights and responsibilities that change over time, based on the ways in which a child\u2019s own capacities are limited.\n\nIn this view, as children become more capable, their rights increase within developmentally appropriate limits, while parental rights and responsibilities decrease. If a five year old prefers vanilla ice cream over strawberry, most people believe that, all else being equal, he or she should be allowed to choose. A seven year old has little say in a custody agreement, but a fourteen year old who prefers to be with one or the other parent can get a hearing from a judge. Similarly, the capacity for sexual consent emerges gradually during adolescence. Young teens may be capable of consenting with each other, but their vulnerability to manipulation and exploitation means they are protected legally by the concept of statutory rape.\n\nIn 1923, Kahlil Gibran published his much loved book, The Prophet,which contains his poem \u201cOn Children.\u201d Gibran\u2019s poem, though deeply spiritual, reflects a modern view of childhood:\n\nYour children are not your children. They are the sons and daughters of Life\u2019s longing for itself.\n\nThey come through you but not from you, And though they are with you yet they belong not to you.\n\nYou may give them your love but not your thoughts, For they have their own thoughts.\n\nYou may house their bodies but not their souls, For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow, which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams.\n\nYou may strive to be like them, but seek not to make them like you. For life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday.\n\nGibran\u2019s 20th Century view would have been completely alien to most of the Bible writers.\n\nA Biblical View of Childhood\n\nIn the Iron Age mindset of the Bible writers, children are not individual persons who have their own thoughts, with corresponding rights. Rather, like livestock and slaves, they are possessions of the male head of household, and the biblical framework governing treatment of children is property laws, not individual rights laws.\n\nThe term chattelrefers to moveable personal property, economic assets that are not real estate. In the Bible, children, like slaves and livestock, are chattel. Male children grow up to become persons, while females remain chattelthroughout their lives, first as assets of their fathers, then as assets of their husbands.\n\nThe texts bound together in the Bible were written over the course of hundreds of years, and they reflect the evolution of social and ethical norms within Hebrew culture during that time span. Some express a more compassionate and dignifying perspective toward children than others. But fundamentalists and other Bible-believers treat these texts as a package, a set of perfect and complete revelations essentially dictated by God to the authors, which is why they all too often end up pitting themselves against ethical, compassionate treatment of children.
