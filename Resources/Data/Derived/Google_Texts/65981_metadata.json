She's a medically-retired police officer who collects a worker's compensation check every month for an injury she said prevented her from doing her job. A review of Glemba's records reveal she suffered a back and knee injury in 1995 during a training exercise with the Mesa Police Department.\n\nSo, according to CBS 5, she worked and raced in dozens of events, including several triathlons, for several years subsequent to this injury. Then in 2007 she was investigated by the police over some inappropriate behavior:\n\nThe 2007 internal affairs investigation revealed Glemba and members of the squad she supervised were taking photos of themselves, the homeless and disabled, which they ridiculed with disparaging and offensive remarks. \"They were posting all of that various photographs on walls in different montages, and they'd make captions about who they were or what they were doing,\" said [Mesa Police Detective Steve] Berry. The investigation ended when Glemba was fired in December of 2008.\n\nSo after she was fired, she appealed. She was briefly reinstated, long enough for the pension board to rule that she was medically unable to perform the tasks of her job, and then her medical retirement was approved. And then she left again. In addition, she\u2019s getting $500 a month in worker\u2019s compensation for her injuries in addition to her medical retirement. So that\u2019s a pretty nice chain of events for Glemba. The television station says that the pension board did know she was involved in these athletic competitions prior to approving her medical retirement.\n\nRead or watch the full piece here.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "You try it and see what happens", "title": "Arizona Ex-Police Officer on Medical Disability Runs Triathlons", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2014/02/03/arizona-ex-police-officer-on-medical-dis", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/13914638446378.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "From the \u201cIf you did this, not\nonly would you be facing jail time but your state\u2019s attorney\ngeneral would send out a press release about it\u201d files, a Mesa,\nAriz., police officer who is receiving monthly worker\u2019s\ncompensation checks and successfully arranged for a medical\nretirement is racing in triathlons.\nCBS 5 in Arizona", "title": "Arizona Ex-Police Officer on Medical Disability Runs Triathlons", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/13914638446378.jpg", "creator": "@sshackford", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "Economics", "published_time": "2014-02-03T22:00:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/scott-shackford"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "article_summary": "In addition, she\u2019s getting $500 a month in worker\u2019s compensation for her injuries in addition to her medical retirement.\nThe television station says that the pension board did know she was involved in these athletic competitions prior to approving her medical retirement.\nShe's a medically-retired police officer who collects a worker's compensation check every month for an injury she said prevented her from doing her job.\nShe was briefly reinstated, long enough for the pension board to rule that she was medically unable to perform the tasks of her job, and then her medical retirement was approved.\nSo, according to CBS 5, she worked and raced in dozens of events, including several triathlons, for several years subsequent to this injury."}
