The relationship began in 2012 when the exchange awarded Xerox what ultimately became a $75 million contract. Xerox was hired to build software to enroll Nevada consumers and create a payment processing system for distributing compensation to insurance companies, which were then supposed to pay brokers.\n\nNevada was the only state to build its own payment and billing infrastructure rather than having insurance companies handle it.\n\nHaving the state collect payments from consumers has been a principal complaint of brokers since the exchange launched in October.\n\nInsurance companies traditionally collected money from consumers and then paid brokers. But Xerox\u2019s system changed that.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s another example of an inept system that fails,\u201d said Las Vegas insurance broker Pat Casale.\n\nNo broker has been more vocal about the failures of the exchange than Casale. He\u2019s spent countless unpaid hours working with state and Xerox officials to enroll Nevadans who paid for coverage but didn\u2019t receive it.\n\nCasale recently received his first check for the Nevada Health Co-Op after spending months enrolling consumers into their plans without getting paid.\n\nHe said other brokers haven\u2019t been as lucky.\n\nOne broker, he said, has enrolled 40 Nevadans and not received any compensation.\n\n\u201cYou're working and putting in hours and you still have to chase your money,\u201d he said.\n\nThe lawsuit from the brokers is the latest legal action taken against the exchange and Xerox. Callister is legal counsel in another class action lawsuit representing Nevadans who claim they paid but didn\u2019t receive coverage. The Las Vegas Sun asked Xerox in June how many consumers paid but didn\u2019t receive coverage. The company\u2019s response: \u201cWe\u2019re not at liberty\u201d to disclose.\n\nNevada was one of 17 states to build its own exchange as a way to comply with the Affordable Care Act.\n\nGov. Brian Sandoval was the only Republican governor whose state opted to build its own exchange. He and other state leaders were leery of using the federal system, healthcare.gov.\n\nSandoval\u2019s office was warned of serious flaws in the software that runs the exchange in the weeks before its Oct. 1 launch, according to an internal report from an outside auditor.\n\nBut the exchange still opened for business.\n\nFor the exchange\u2019s upcoming enrollment period, Nevadans will have to enroll on healthcare.gov \u2014 the very system that Sandoval and other state officials wanted to avoid.\n\nThe 38,000 Nevadans who successfully enrolled, along with those who didn\u2019t, will be forced to sign up using the federal system this November.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A group of six insurance brokers is headlining a new class-action lawsuit filed against the Silver State Exchange and the tech contractor Xerox.
