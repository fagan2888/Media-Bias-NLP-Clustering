Even if we put aside the questions about how Trump intends to do that \u2013 and how, exactly, the Republican candidate defines \u201cgreat\u201d \u2013 it\u2019s a phrase that inevitably leads a question about when America was great, if it\u2019s not great now.\n\nMargot Sanger-Katz explained in the New York Times today that Trump\u2019s followers don\u2019t necessarily agree on an answer, but they have a few ideas.\n\nT he slogan evokes a time when America was stronger and more prosperous. But Mr. Trump doesn\u2019t specify whether he\u2019s expressing nostalgia for the 1950s \u2013 or 10 years ago. That vagueness is reflected by his voters, according to the results of a new survey, conducted online by the digital media and polling company Morning Consult. When asked to select America\u2019s greatest year, Trump supporters offered a wide range of answers, with no distinct pattern. The most popular choice was the year 2000. But 1955, 1960, 1970 and 1985 were also popular. More than 2 percent of Trump\u2019s supporters picked 2015, when Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign began.\n\nThe same Times article flagged a Pew Research Center report from last month in which 75% of Trump supporters said life was better 50 years ago. Most Republicans also endorsed the idea, but it was Trump backers who were the most enthusiastic about it.\n\nI don\u2019t imagine many will find this surprising, but it\u2019s nevertheless a notable validation of a broader thesis. Much of Trump\u2019s core base includes older, white men, who\u2019ve seen generational changes with which they\u2019re generally uncomfortable. Over the last half-century, the United States has grown more diverse; women have made great strides towards overdue equality; and the current role of African Americans and LGBT Americans in society would have been difficult for much of the public to imagine 50 years ago.\n\nIt\u2019s hardly shocking that Trump, pushing a nativist nationalism, has supporters who\u2019d prefer to roll back the clock.\n\nAs for what Americans in general consider their country\u2019s greatest year, apparently 2000 \u201cwas the most popular choice, a preference that cut across political party, candidate preference, gender and age.\u201d\n\nIn all candor, without giving it a lot of thought, 2000 was my first choice, too. The economy was booming; there was relative international peace; and the nation\u2019s reputation abroad was sterling and unrivaled. George W. Bush had not yet taken office, which means we\u2019re talking about a time before 9/11, before the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, before the Great Recession, and before the radicalization of Republican politics reached a fever pitch.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "It's hardly shocking that Donald Trump, pushing a nativist nationalism, has supporters who'd prefer to roll back the clock.
