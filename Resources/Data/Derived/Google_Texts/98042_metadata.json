The Florida senator clearly wants to win the Iowa Republican caucuses, which would help propel him to his party\u2019s presidential nomination. He also wants to defend his far-right policy priorities, which means opposing the ethanol mandate and taking aim at the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS).\n\nThe trouble, of course, is that those two goals are occasionally in conflict. The RFS is quite popular in Iowa , but it\u2019s also plainly at odds with Rubio\u2019s conservative agenda.\n\nThreading this needle isn\u2019t easy, and Radio Iowa reported this morning on the line the senator has come up with.\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Marco Rubio says he supports the so-called ethanol mandate \u2013 now that it\u2019s in place, but he favors letting it expire seven years from now. \u201cThe Renewable Fuels Standard is not something that I would have voted for had I been in the Senate, but it is now existing law and I think it would be unfair to simply yank it away from people that have made investments based on its existence,\u201d Rubio says.\n\nAs pandering goes, this talking point is almost plausible. Rubio doesn\u2019t like the RFS and wouldn\u2019t have voted for it when Congress approved the policy in 2005 (five years before Rubio was elected). He realizes, however, that the policy exists; it\u2019s popular; people have come to rely on it; and it\u2019s not reasonable for a Republican administration to simply \u201cyank\u201d the policy away from Americans to satisfy an ideological goal.\n\nBut couldn\u2019t this same principle have broad applications?\n\nTake another look at Rubio\u2019s quote, but this time, let\u2019s swap in an entirely different policy: \u201cThe [Affordable Care Act] is not something that I would have voted for had I been in the Senate, but it is now existing law and I think it would be unfair to simply yank it away from people that have made investments based on its existence.\u201d\n\nWhen the issue is ethanol, Rubio believes this approach is perfectly sound. When the issue is health security for tens of millions of families, Rubio is convinced the approach is nonsense.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Rubio wants to win Iowa, but he opposes the Renewable Fuel Standard, which is popular among Iowans.
