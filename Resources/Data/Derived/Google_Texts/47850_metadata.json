In \u201cIdentity Thief,\u201d she portrayed a felonious hot mess with a penchant for punching people in their throats, albeit with an underlying heart of gold. But by the time \u201cThe Heat\u201d rolled around last summer, she was playing an unkempt bundle of violence and aggression whose every other utterance was a threat of anatomically impossible bodily harm.\n\nNow, in \u201cTammy,\u201d she\u2019s an angry slob, dumb as a sack of plungers, who falls down, flies off the hood of a car, crashes a personal watercraft and gets kicked in the face by a deer.\n\nOf all the Melissa McCarthy movies, \u201cTammy\u201d is by far the Melissa McCarthy-est.\n\nThe actress is obviously playing to her perceived strengths. She co-wrote the script with her fellow Groundlings alum husband, Ben Falcone, who makes his directing debut. (Falcone, who\u2019s had small, memorable roles in all her movies, plays her boss in \u201cTammy.\u201d)\n\nBut too often, at least during its first half, \u201cTammy\u201d feels like a case of been there, done something similar but not quite as over-the-top as that.\n\nRight off the bat, McCarthy\u2019s Tammy totals her beater Toyota Corolla, gets fired from her fast-food job and catches her husband (Nat Faxon) cheating with a neighbor (Toni Collette). Her suitcase even falls apart on her way out the door, leaving Tammy to scoop up her meager belongings before setting off on foot to stay with her mom (Allison Janney), who lives just two doors down.\n\nAll Tammy wants is to get out of tiny Murphysboro, Ill. So when her grandmother Pearl (Susan Sarandon) offers the use of her car and a roll of cash for Tammy\u2019s getaway, the unlikely duo hit the road, bound for Niagara Falls.\n\nFuzzy math aside (there\u2019s only a 24-year age difference between McCarthy and Sarandon, who\u2019s aged for the part), the actresses work well together. And I can\u2019t remember the last time Sarandon had this much fun onscreen.\n\nOnce on the road, Pearl drinks too much and admits to having had a six-month fling with Duane Allman. During a stop at a Louisville, Ky., barbecue joint, Pearl hooks up with good ol\u2019 boy Earl (Gary Cole), and the two of them go at it in the backseat of her car as Earl\u2019s son, Bobby (Mark Duplass), and Tammy recoil in horror.\n\nBut the movie isn\u2019t \u201cPearl.\u201d It\u2019s \u201cTammy.\u201d And an awful lot of it feels familiar.\n\nThere isn\u2019t a drawer in which Tammy is the sharpest knife. She thinks Neil Armstrong was a world-class cyclist and can\u2019t believe the price of gas: \u201cFour dollars a gallon? Thanks, Obamacare!\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s the now-obligatory dance scene, a la \u201cIdentity Thief\u201d and \u201cThe Heat.\u201d And there\u2019s a transformation that feels even more forced, albeit more welcome, than the one in \u201cIdentity Thief.\u201d\n\nOnce \u201cTammy\u201d settles down and transitions, somewhat abruptly, from raucous road-trip comedy to a Tammy-Bobby romance, it offers McCarthy a beautiful chance to shine.\n\nShe\u2019s all over Bobby while Pearl and Earl are flirting, at one point making out with him against his will. Bobby: \u201cI do not want your tongue in my mouth.\u201d Tammy: \u201cWhere do you want it, man?\u201d But a makeover for a Fourth of July party softens not just Tammy\u2019s sweatpants-and-Crocs appearance, but her persona as well.\n\nOnce you scrub away some of the layers, Tammy is sweet and vulnerable, and it\u2019s nice to see McCarthy get to play something as simple as a smitten woman.\n\nDuplass (\u201cThe League\u201d) is in his element as Bobby, who can\u2019t quite explain his attraction to Tammy. And the supporting cast is mostly terrific. Kathy Bates as Tammy\u2019s lesbian aunt is worthy of special praise, as is Sarah Baker as an employee in the restaurant Tammy robs in one of the few big moments that really works. Faxon and Collette are so underutilized, though, you wonder why they were cast.\n\nThe second half of the movie seems to be the one McCarthy and Falcone have the most interest in, with the predictable outrageousness feeling like nothing more than a way to get moviegoers in the door for the story they really want to tell.\n\nMcCarthy is such a unique and gifted performer, it would be refreshing to see her have the confidence to play a somewhat subdued character that didn\u2019t require a midmovie course correction.\n\nUntil then, she\u2019s in danger of succumbing to Chris Farley Syndrome and a career in which she feels obliged to crash through something for a laugh.\n\nContact Christopher Lawrence at clawrence@reviewjournal.com or 702-380-4567.", "article_metadata": {"description": "At this rate, we\u2019re probably only a couple of movies away from seeing Melissa McCarthy play a feral clump of sweatpants and greasy hair, living under a bridge and scaring small children.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Christopher Lawrence LAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNAL", "parsely-title": "McCarthy adds to gallery of unkempt characters in \u2018Tammy\u2019", "parsely-link": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/columns-blogs/christopher-lawrence/mccarthy-adds-gallery-unkempt-characters-tammy", "twitter": {"description": "At this rate, we\u2019re probably only a couple of movies away from seeing Melissa McCarthy play a feral clump of sweatpants and greasy hair, living under a bridge and scaring small children.", "title": "McCarthy adds to gallery of unkempt characters in \u2018Tammy\u2019", "url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/columns-blogs/christopher-lawrence/mccarthy-adds-gallery-unkempt-characters-tammy", "image": {"src": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_web-tammy_3.jpg, http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_tammy-2_3.jpg, http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_web-tammy-3_3.jpg"}, "creator": {"identifier": "@reviewjournal", "id": 15358759}, "card": "summary"}, "vf": {"unique_id": "reviewjournal-nid-1893331"}, "al": {"web": {"should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "review-journal://?eid=1575664", "app_name": "review-journal", "package": "com.LVRJ"}, "ios": {"url": "review-journal://?eid=1575664", "app_store_id": 540820524, "app_name": "review-journal"}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1098299519", "fb": {"admins": 630759385, "app_id": 195491203833571}, "google-play-app": "app-id=com.LVRJ", "og": {"site_name": "Las Vegas Review-Journal", "description": "At this rate, we\u2019re probably only a couple of movies away from seeing Melissa McCarthy play a feral clump of sweatpants and greasy hair, living under a bridge and scaring small children.", "title": "McCarthy adds to gallery of unkempt characters in \u2018Tammy\u2019", "url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/columns-blogs/christopher-lawrence/mccarthy-adds-gallery-unkempt-characters-tammy", "image": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_web-tammy_3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "parsely-author": "Christopher Lawrence LAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNAL", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "Christopher Lawrence,Movies and TV, Neon,", "parsely-section": "Blog_Christopher Lawrence", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-03T18:07:53-07:00"}, "parsely-tags": "Blog_Christopher Lawrence,Movies and TV,Neon", "parsely-image-url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_web-tammy_3.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-07-04T01:07:53Z"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd273\"", "article_summary": "Of all the Melissa McCarthy movies, \u201cTammy\u201d is by far the Melissa McCarthy-est.\nAt this rate, we\u2019re probably only a couple of movies away from seeing Melissa McCarthy play a feral clump of sweatpants and greasy hair, living under a bridge and scaring small children.\nFuzzy math aside (there\u2019s only a 24-year age difference between McCarthy and Sarandon, who\u2019s aged for the part), the actresses work well together.\nBut the movie isn\u2019t \u201cPearl.\u201d It\u2019s \u201cTammy.\u201d And an awful lot of it feels familiar.\nShe\u2019s all over Bobby while Pearl and Earl are flirting, at one point making out with him against his will."}
