But narrow networks have been in vogue in the post-Affordable Care Act world, as payers seek to roll out offerings that serve patients who are potentially older and sicker \u2014 while keeping premium costs within a certain band.\n\nMcKinsey found that about 70% of hospital provider networks on the ACA\u2019s exchanges are either narrow or ultra-narrow, which the consultancy defined as having 14 or fewer hospitals. Closer to home in California, only about one-third of San Diego-area doctors were covered through Covered California, one expert noted.\n\nPatients and providers have raised concerns that by limiting plan participants, narrow networks are creating unexpected access challenges. For instance, Californians who were used to shopping through the individual market and have been pushed to the exchange may find that they can\u2019t access the doctors they\u2019ve been seeing for years. Some patients have said they can\u2019t find the specialists they need.\n\n(In a further complication for patients attempting to pick a plan, many insurance exchanges\u2019 online provider directories have been broken or misleading.)\n\nBut on one count, narrow networks have scored a big win: They\u2019ve been credited with tamping down health insurance costs.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t like narrow networks,\u201d David Blumenthal of the Commonwealth Fund recently wrote, \u201cyou\u2019re saying \u2026 that you don\u2019t like competitive solutions \u2014 at least under current market conditions \u2014 to our health system\u2019s problems.\u201d\n\nInside the Model \u2014 and Why it\u2019s Frustrated so Many\n\nNarrow networks aren\u2019t just an Obamacare story, of course. Even four years ago, more and more insurers suggested they were exploring the model at the impetus of employers seeking to rein in health spending.\n\nAnd in some cases, those insurers were celebrated for their ingenuity. In a 2012 cover story for Managed Care Magazine, an executive putting together a narrow network was even compared to baseball general manager Billy Beane \u2014 creator of \u201cMoneyball\u201d \u2014 for his savvy in picking and choosing plan participants.\n\nNo one is celebrating narrow network creators now.\n\nWhat changed? The divisive nature of the ACA may have helped tarnish the idea \u2014 narrow networks are an easy target for opponents of the law, some suggest. But more acutely, the widespread changeover in the individual market has led to growing frustration in the provider community.\n\nA California Medical Association survey released in April found that 80% of surveyed doctors have been confused about their participation in a Covered California plan \u2014 and roughly 50% of them weren\u2019t even sure how they ended up on certain plan lists.\n\nMore than half think they lost patients as a result of patients picking the wrong plans.\n\nBut if doctors have it bad \u2026 patients may have it worse.\n\nIn her \u201cAsk Emily\u201d column, Emily Bazar recently walked through a scenario where a doctor and hospital didn\u2019t mix: The doctor was included in a new ACA exchange plan, but the hospital where the doctor practiced was not. That left the patient on the hook to pick up extra costs.\n\n\u201cAs more Californians start to use their new health insurance, they\u2019re finding these kinds of doctor and hospital mismatches,\u201d Bazar writes.\n\n\u201c[And] now that you\u2019re stuck with a plan, the best thing you can do is verify, verify, verify,\u201d she adds, unless you want to be stick with thousands of extra dollars in bills or have to switch doctors.\n\nThe \u201cACA has made my health care significantly worse because I can no longer see any of my doctors,\u201d one reader told California Healthline. \u201cMy only hope is next year more doctors start taking Covered [California] insurance.\u201d\n\nPressures To Change\n\nBut there\u2019s a challenge for critics: While they can cite anecdotal stories of angry patients or doctors who lost revenue, they\u2019re ultimately facing a data gap. Defenders of narrow networks can point to several studies that suggest high-priced providers don\u2019t offer any additional value. For example, a 2011 study by Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley found that hospitals that charged more didn\u2019t deliver any better care.\n\nAnd supporters of the model can cite Covered California\u2019s premiums, which were surprisingly low in year one of ACA enrollment. That was largely because some top-rated, if expensive, providers were left out of the exchange.\n\nStill, there are a few reasons why narrow networks will get a bit less narrow in the coming months.\n\nThe push for \u2018reasonable access\u2019: Get used to hearing this term \u2014 and \u201cnetwork adequacy\u201d \u2014 as year two of ACA enrollment kicks in. In a regulation released last month, CMS pushed new rules that specify a percentage of how many providers must be in a certain network. For example, CMS will require insurers to have contracts with at least 30% of \u201cessential community providers\u201d in their service areas.\n\nAccording to Kaiser Family Foundation\u2019s Karen Pollitz, who commented on an earlier version of the rules, the move away from allowing individual exchanges to monitor participating plans is a big change. \u201cIt\u2019s much more specific, and it\u2019s going to involve a lot more direct federal oversight,\u201d she told the Wall Street Journal.\n\nLegal pressures on insurers: Providers in several states \u2014 a children\u2019s hospital in Seattle and a medical association in Connecticut \u2014 have sued insurers in an attempt to avoid being dropped or excluded. Whether or not those suits are successful, it\u2019s upped broader scrutiny on insurers. And wary about the potential backlash from providers, and the possibility of state legislation that requires them to take \u201cAny Willing Provider,\u201d payers are working to be more inclusive.\n\nOther plans opting in: A number of insurers sat out of the health insurance exchanges, citing concerns over launch and implementation. But more plans participating in the exchanges in year two presumably will lead to more choices.\n\nSome of the problem with \u201cnarrow network\u201d may be related to the word itself. And a different way of thinking about the term may induce different connotations.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to offer the provider perspective (and) use the term high-performing network instead of narrow network,\u201d Craig Sammit of HealthCare Partners told Modern Healthcare in December. \u201cIt really is more characteristic of the environment that we\u2019re in.\u201d\n\nAround the nation\n\nHere\u2019s a look at other stories making news on the road to reform.\n\nMedicaid enrollees may be sicker, underserved: Peter Frost at the Chicago Tribune notes that the first crop of consumers gaining coverage in Cook County suffer from many chronic conditions.\n\nCan we do the \u2018right thing\u2019 profitably? Harold Pollack interviews Harvard economist and Obamacare architect David Cutler on the social impact of current reforms.\n\nWhy Cleveland Clinic\u2019s model is so hard to replicate: The White House is reportedly eying Toby Cosgrove, CEO of Cleveland Clinic, to serve as the next Secretary of Veterans Affairs. In 2012, \u201cRoad to Reform\u201d took a look at why Cleveland Clinic was celebrated as a model for the Affordable Care Act \u2014 and why its model is so hard to replicate.", "article_metadata": {"description": "<p>With legal challenges, new market entrants and recent CMS regulations, narrow networks may be a little less narrow in year two of Affordable Care Act enrollment.
