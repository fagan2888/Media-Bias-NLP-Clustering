Feldman and U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan Michael McKinley requesting that their offices provide more information about the massive money transfer.\n\nThe State Department originally gave Afghanistan $75 million last September, with the stipulation that the government would be required to document how it had spent the money.\n\nAfghanistan officials responded, saying they used the money to address \u201curgent needs including payment for civil servant salaries.\u201d Despite the vague answer, the U.S. ponied up an additional $25 million. Sopko\u2019s letter suggests that State didn\u2019t have enough information from Afghanistan to be assured that the money was getting in the right hands.\n\nRelated: What the Pentagon is Hiding from Its Auditors\n\nThe auditor included five questions for the U.S. officials to answer\u2014including \u201chow [did] the State Department determine[d] that $100 million was an appropriate amount\u201d? SIGAR also asked if the U.S. had verified how the money was spent.\n\nSopko and his team have been extremely critical of U.S.\u2019s reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan. They have consistently warned that without significant reform, the rebuilding efforts \u2014 already costing taxpayers an astronomical $104 billion \u2013 will fail. And SIGAR routinely publishes scathing reports from its investigations on the ground in Afghanistan.\n\nJust last month, SIGAR issued a report questioning whether $400 million in funding for women\u2019s development programs is being used for its intended purposed. U.S. officials, for their part, responded sharply to Sopko, saying their efforts have so far demonstrated results. The auditors, however, still expressed doubts and said the U.S. government has no sufficient way to track whether the programs are actually working.\n\nRelated: The Government\u2019s $125 Billion Slap in the Face to Taxpayers\n\nSeparately, they have been increasingly critical of U.S.\u2019s efforts to fund the Afghan National Security Forces, which have dwindled to their lowest levels in recent history.\n\nTogether, the spate of troubling reports paint an alarming picture of U.S. reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan. So, it should come as no surprise that Sopko and his office are skeptical about throwing more money at the Afghan government with little oversight.\n\n\u201cUnless these trends change, it seems likely that the Afghan government will require continued financial assistance from the United States and other donors for years,\u201d the letter said. \u201cIn February, officials from the U.S. Embassy warned me that the shortfall could be as much as $400 million this year unless the Afghan government\u2019s revenue generation increases significantly.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Late last year, the Afghanistan government asked the United States and other internati", "title": "$100 Million Taxpayer Dollars Missing in Afghanistan", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2015/04/23/100-Million-Taxpayer-Dollars-Missing-Afghanistan", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/afghanistan-military_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2015/04/23/100-Million-Taxpayer-Dollars-Missing-Afghanistan", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/afghanistan-military_2.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@Briannaehley"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Late last year, the Afghanistan government asked the United States and other internati", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddff1\"", "article_summary": "The Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR), John Sopko, on Thursday sent a letter to Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan Daniel F.
