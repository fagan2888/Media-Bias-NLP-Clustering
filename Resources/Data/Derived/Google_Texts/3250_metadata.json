(Photo: Heidi de Marco, Kaiser Health News)\n\nALBUQUERQUE, N.M. \u2014 As a member of the Navajo tribe, Rochelle Jake has received free care through the Indian Health Service (IHS) her entire life. The clinics took care of her asthma, allergies and eczema \u2013 chronic problems, nothing urgent.\n\nRecently, though, she felt sharp pains in her side. Her doctor recommended an MRI and other tests she couldn\u2019t get through IHS. To pay for it, he urged her to sign up for private insurance under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t wrap my head around it,\u201d said Jake, 45, sitting on the porch swing of her home in Albuquerque. She didn\u2019t think Obamacare applied to her.\n\n\u201cI thought [IHS] should be responsible for my health care because I am Native American.\u201d\n\nTribes, health care advocates and government officials across the nation are trying to enroll as many Native Americans as possible in Obamacare, saying it offers new choices to patients and financial relief for struggling Indian hospitals and clinics.\n\nNative Americans can get an exemption from the requirement that everybody have health insurance. But under the health law, many can get coverage under Medicaid, which serves low-income Americans or buy subsidized plans through insurance exchanges. That allows them to receive treatment from private doctors and hospitals rather than rely solely on government and tribal facilities.\n\nAnd the coverage allows Indian health facilities \u2013 which tribal leaders say are chronically underfunded -- to offer new services and bill insurers for care they already provide.\n\nAdvocates also see the health law as a chance to reduce the health disparities that have long afflicted Native Americans, including rates of diabetes that are three times higher than the U.S. population.\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act is starting to fill the gap between need and current resources,\u201d said Doneg McDonough, a consultant to tribes on implementation of the health law. \u201cAnd it is a huge gap that has to be filled in.\u201d\n\nThe Indian Health Service provides care to about 2.2 million American Indians and Alaska Natives in 35 states. But the federal agency, with a fixed budget of $4.6 billion, can\u2019t afford comprehensive services at all its far-flung facilities.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if you guys have all heard of this saying, \u2018Don\u2019t get sick after June because IHS runs out of funding in June,\u2019\u201d enrollment worker Shaina Ramone recently told a crowd at a Navajo business near Farmington, N.M. \u201cSo don\u2019t get sick in July or August.\u201d\n\nMargaret Thompson, 59, has arthritis and diabetes.

His organization persuaded Jake to enroll in a plan through New Mexico\u2019s exchange that costs about $37 a month. She can finally schedule an MRI.\n\nNative Americans in federally recognized tribes can sign up year-round. Weahkee, who is part Navajo and part Pueblo, meets one on one with potential enrollees, answering questions and promoting the benefits of insurance.\n\nAt a traditional tribal feast in Santo Domingo, a small pueblo about 45 minutes from Albuquerque, he stands in front of a shaded table, handing out brochures and fans with the logo of the New Mexico exchange.\n\nThe next day, he travels to the hilltop Navajo reservation in Shiprock, where he talks to customers at busy grocery store and a small restaurant where a handwritten menu features mutton stew, Navajo burger and fry bread.\n\nHelping Hospitals, Too\n\nDoctor Angelina Shigeura checks a patient's record at the Zuni Comprehensive Community Health Center.

But tribal officials and experts around the country said Indian health facilities and contractors are already reaping the benefits. In fiscal year 2014, the Indian Health Service collected $49 million more in revenue because of patients newly insured through the ACA, according to the agency.\n\nIn New Mexico, Leonard Thomas, acting IHS director for the Albuquerque region, says the money is helping modernize aging facilities and add medical staff. Thomas says the IHS can now pay for more services, such as diagnostic tests from outside facilities.\n\nBrian Garretson, director of patient financial services for the San Juan Regional Medical Center, a nonprofit community hospital in Farmington, is more than willing to lend space to outreach workers to sign up new enrollees. His hospital contracts with IHS to provide care to Native Americans. \u201cThere are times when we get to the end of their fiscal year and they have already gone through all their money so we aren\u2019t going to get paid,\u201d he said.\n\nAt the Zuni Comprehensive Health Center on a reservation west of Albuquerque, CEO Jean Othole said she\u2019s excited about the future. With added revenue, she plans to expand the number of exam rooms throughout the hospital.\n\nStill, Othole said, the hospital struggles to recruit doctors, and patients have to leave for surgeries and most emergency and specialty care.\n\nMuch More To Do\n\nFedelia Perez, a 29-year old Navajo woman from Pinehill, New Mexico, is recovering after giving birth to her baby, Marcos Perez, at the Zuni Comprehensive Community Health Center on Thursday, August 6, 2015. The hospital is not equipped to perform C-sections, so patients need to leave for surgeries and most emergency and specialty care. (Photo: Heidi de Marco, Kaiser Health News)\n\nThe health law so far is having an uneven impact on Native Americans. Not all states chose to expand Medicaid. And because of the way the law defines Native American, only certain tribal members are entitled to special benefits such as a restriction on co-pays and deductibles.\n\nSome people are more receptive to health insurance than others. Galen Martinez, a teacher who lives on the Acoma pueblo west of Albuquerque, hasn\u2019t signed up. As he cooked chicken wings at a tribal ceremony in Gallup, Martinez said the U.S. government should provide comprehensive health care to Native Americans for free, as promised. Insurance doesn\u2019t solve the problem \u2013 even if you have it, getting from remote reservations to cities for care is burdensome, he said.\n\nWeahkee and his team say that is part of their challenge. Along with signing Native Americans up for insurance, they also teach them how to use it.\n\nThey recently helped enroll 59-year-old Margaret Thompson in an exchange plan. It was the first time the Navajo woman had been insured. Sitting at an outreach office in Farmington, Thompson said now she\u2019s nervous about seeking out private doctors to treat her arthritis and diabetes. She\u2019s used to the Indian Health Service.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where to begin,\u201d she said.\n\nKaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1UOElEx", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. \u2014 As a member of the Navajo tribe, Rochelle Jake has received free care through the Indian Health Service (IHS) her entire life.
