in advance when asked by reporters, subsequently issued a short statement confirming the event.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs I noted in today\u2019s briefing, President Obama and Secretary Clinton enjoy catching-up in person when their schedules permit,\u201d the press secretary, Josh Earnest, said. \u201cThis afternoon they met privately for about an hour at the White House and discussed a range of topics.\u201d\n\n", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#005689", "description": "Former secretary of state tweets image of hug with Barack Obama in support of Affordable Care Act while
