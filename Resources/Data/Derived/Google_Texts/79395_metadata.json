Kansas uses the federal government\u2019s HealthCare.gov website as its exchange, while some states including Minnesota developed their own exchanges.\n\nThe marketplaces are an option for individuals and families who buy health insurance on their own, outside of employer groups and government programs. Some have described United\u2019s pullback as a blow to the exchanges, while others have downplayed the significance given the insurer\u2019s historically small position in the individual market.\n\nUnited is the nation\u2019s largest health insurer, but it\u2019s primary business is providing benefits for employer groups and the Medicare and Medicaid government programs.\n\nIn Kansas, rates won\u2019t be finalized, and companies won\u2019t be obligated to compete on the state\u2019s exchange, until final agreements are signed in September, said Selzer, the Kansas insurance commissioner.\n\nIn a news release, Medica said it will sell policies both on the Kansas exchange, and in the \u201coff-exchange\u201d market where consumers buy directly from insurers or through brokers.\n\nMuch like when Medica entered Iowa and Nebraska, the insurer in Kansas will sell policies in which the Rochester-based Mayo Clinic will serve as a \u201ccenter of excellence.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe program allows patients to receive care at Mayo Clinic with Medica providing a travel, lodging and meal stipend for the patient and a companion, to provide peace of mind to individuals and families experiencing significant health care issues,\u201d Medica said in a statement.\n\nTwitter: @chrissnowbeck", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "Minnetonka-based Medica announced plans Thursday to sell coverage for 2017 through the government-run health insurance exchange in Kansas.", "title": "Medica plans to sell coverage in Kansas", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/medica-plans-to-sell-coverage-in-kansas/379232981/", "image": {"url": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201462", "width": 1680, "identifier": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201462", "height": 876}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "Minnetonka-based Medica announced plans Thursday to sell coverage for 2017 through the government-run health insurance exchange in Kansas.", "title": "Medica plans to sell coverage in Kansas", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/medica-plans-to-sell-coverage-in-kansas/379232981/", "image": {"src": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201462", "identifier": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201462"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Minnetonka-based Medica announced plans Thursday to sell coverage for 2017 through the government-run health insurance exchange in Kansas."}, "article_summary": "Minnetonka-based Medica announced plans Thursday to sell coverage for 2017 through the government-run health insurance exchange in Kansas.\nIn a news release, Medica said it will sell policies both on the Kansas exchange, and in the \u201coff-exchange\u201d market where consumers buy directly from insurers or through brokers.\n\u201cHealth insurance options filed now for the individual market show that competition will likely continue for Kansans\u2019 health insurance policies,\u201d said Ken Selzer, the Kansas Commissioner of Insurance, in a news release.\nIn Kansas, rates won\u2019t be finalized, and companies won\u2019t be obligated to compete on the state\u2019s exchange, until final agreements are signed in September, said Selzer, the Kansas insurance commissioner.\nThe marketplaces are an option for individuals and families who buy health insurance on their own, outside of employer groups and government programs."}
