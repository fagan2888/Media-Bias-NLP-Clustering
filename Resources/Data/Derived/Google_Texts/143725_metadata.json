Jerry Brown releases his revised state budget on May 14, 2015, in Sacramento. ( John Myers/KQED )\n\nGov. Jerry Brown introduced his $122.6 billion general fund budget in Sacramento on Thursday, including a new approach to replacing a soon-to-expire tax on managed care organizations.\n\nThe present MCO tax will end on June 30 if legislators cannot agree on a replacement. California faces the loss of $1.1 billion in revenue, including federal match funds. A plan launched last year during a special legislative session on health did not advance.\n\nBrown is now proposing an overall reform package on taxes insurers pay that he says will ultimately save them money.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s lowering the corporate tax, lowering the premiums tax,\u201d Brown said, \u201cand you blend all that together. Because of the way the federal government works, money can flow to us, and it will be net for California.\u201d\n\nBrown said he hoped to get the issue resolved \u201cin a month,\u201d but stressed there was no deal as yet with the health plans.\n\nBrown\u2019s proposal includes where that money might be spent:\n\nThe Budget also assumes that revenues from the tax be placed in a special fund and be used to restore the 7\u2010percent reduction to the In\u2010Home Supportive Services ($236 million annually). Finally, the Budget assumes the tax is in place for three years starting in 2016\u201017.\n\nCharles Bacchi, California Association of Health Plans CEO, said he appreciated new options on an MCO tax. \u201cI think they\u2019ve been working very hard, and certainly credit is due to them. At this time, we\u2019re still looking at it. We\u2019re still trying to confirm it. There will be more discussions this week with the administration.\u201d\n\nSome are already critical of the proposed plan, which earmarks some of the MCO revenue to the Department of Developmental Services.\n\nTim Hornbecker, director of business development for The Arc of Alameda County, believes tying developmental disabilities funding to the MCO tax is the governor\u2019s way of garnering Republican support for the tax \u2014 he needs a two-thirds vote from the Legislature for the tax to pass.\n\n\u201cThe governor is using people with developmental disabilities as pawns in the system, until he can get his votes from Republicans,\u201d Hornbecker said.\n\nAssemblyman Tom Lackey, R-Palmdale, did not approve of the approach.\n\n\u201cThese folks deserve to be a top consideration in the general funding arena,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they\u2019ve been an \u2018oh, by the way\u2019 consideration, which is deplorable.\u201d\n\nSSI Increase\n\nThe budget includes a 2.8 percent increase in benefits for people who receive Supplemental Security Income/State Supplementary Payment (SSI/SSP). An estimated 1.3 million people are expected to receive monthly benefits in 2016-17, and their maximum grants will be $889 per month for individuals and $1,496 per month for couples, an increase of $17 and $31 respectively.\n\nMedi-Cal Enrollment\n\nThe state\u2019s Medi-Cal enrollment is expected to reach a new high in the next fiscal year \u2014 13.5 million people, or more than a third of all Californians.\n\nCalifornia expanded Medi-Cal as part of the Affordable Care Act. The federal government has been paying 100 percent of the cost of those in the expansion population, but in 2017, California will be responsible for 5 percent of that cost, or $740.2 million in general fund money.\n\nThe state is responsible for half the cost of those who were always eligible for Medi-Cal but did not sign up until the Affordable Care Act went into effect. Next year, that\u2019s expected to be $1.9 billion from the general fund.\n\nUndocumented Immigrant Health Care\n\nOn May 1, 170,000 undocumented children will become eligible for full Medi-Cal benefits. California is the first state in the country to cover undocumented children. The governor earmarked $145 million in general fund money to cover the new costs.\n\nWhile advocates noted there were no new cuts to programs, they were disappointed that the governor did not go further in restoring funding that was deeply cut in the wake of the 2008 recession.\n\n\u201cThis budget proposal largely continues the recession-era cuts to health and human services,\u201d Anthony Wright, executive director, of Health Access, an advocacy group, said in a statement. \u201cThe [budget] surplus was created in part from $15 billion in HHS cuts; it\u2019s high time to restore cuts to Medi-Cal benefits and rates and other public health programs.\u201d\n\nAn earlier version of this story incorrectly quoted Gov. Brown who said his revised MCO plan would be \u201cnet for California\u201d not \u201cnet positive.\u201d KQED regrets the error.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In a political move to get a managed care tax passed, advocates say he's using people with developmental disabilities as 'pawns.'", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Brown's Budget Plan: New Managed Care Tax, Increased SSI Benefits, More Medi-Cal Enrollment\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2016\\/01\\/07\\/browns-budget-plan-new-managed-care-tax-increase-ssi-benefits-more-medi-cal-enrollment\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2016-01-07 14:05:07\",\"mod_date\":\"2016-01-08 11:55:16\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":135833,\"author_id\":\"240\",\"author_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"author_display_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"tags\":[\"Brown\",\"Developmental Disabilities\",\"Medi-Cal\",\"News\"],\"categories\":[\"Policy\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2015\\/05\\/RS15188_IMG_3119-2.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "In a political move to get a managed care tax passed, advocates say he's using people with developmental disabilities as 'pawns.'", "title": "Brown\u2019s Budget Plan: New Managed Care Tax, Increased SSI Benefits, More Medi-Cal Enrollment", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2016/01/07/browns-budget-plan-new-managed-care-tax-increase-ssi-benefits-more-medi-cal-enrollment/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2015/05/RS15188_IMG_3119-2-1440x1092.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "brown,developmental disabilities,medi-cal,news", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Jerry Brown introduced his $122.6 billion general fund budget in Sacramento on Thursday, including a new approach to replacing a soon-to-expire tax on managed care organizations.\nThe present MCO tax will end on June 30 if legislators cannot agree on a replacement.\nCharles Bacchi, California Association of Health Plans CEO, said he appreciated new options on an MCO tax.\nNext year, that\u2019s expected to be $1.9 billion from the general fund.\nThe governor earmarked $145 million in general fund money to cover the new costs."}
