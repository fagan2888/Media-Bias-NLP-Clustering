When she went bald she did not get a wig. She lost her eyebrows and eyelashes. On the day of the interview some of her hair had grown back. She said some people have asked if they could touch the short \"do\" and she has said fine. She plans to keep it short.\n\nOne bad day she was nauseated, bandaged with a an incision nearly armpit to armpit with four drainage tubes hanging from her sides. She thought, \"I've been poisoned and butchered and wishing to heal quickly so I could be radiated.\"\n\nSome of \"My Way's\" lyrics are:\n\n\"Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew,\n\nWhen I bit off more than I could chew.\n\nBut through it all, when there was doubt,\n\nI ate it up and spit it out.\n\nI faced it all and I stood tall,\n\nAnd did it my way.\"\n\nAs a breast cancer survivor she more than survives--she lives.\n\nNatalie was born in LaGrange, Ga., and lived here most of the time until she briefly lived in the Washington, D.C. area, returning home to take over the family business, Reliance Realty LLC.\n\nA certified appraiser and broker, she is the daughter of Paula and Joe Lambert. They still work at the business but she and some co-workers keep it going. She has done appraisals for about eight years with her father. Her mother runs the office and Kim Bozeman is Natalie's assistant.\n\nShe has learned a great deal about the cancer but emphatically states she is a lot of things but is not a group of uncontrollable killer cells.\n\n\"No, I am a Christian, daughter, sister, aunt, lover, friend, dog person, business owner, compassionate... I am a lot of things but I am not cancer. Cancer is a disease...\"\n\nWhen she was undergoing chemotherapy she had to go once every two weeks, scheduling her sick time to usually occur on the weekends so her work week would not be interrupted. Through everything she has exercised, going to CrossFit. She believes that is why she has done much better than some.\n\nThe chemotherapy has ended, then there was surgery. Now she is having daily radiation treatments. She lives in her parents' basement and just keeps on keeping on.\n\n\"For me exercise was not only for the stress, it was preventative of the bad side effects,\" she said. Heart disease is a bad side effect of chemo, and the number one killer of people who have gone through chemotherapy is heart disease, she said.\n\nShe found a lump in her breast--a tumor--but she never got it checked out.\n\n\"I was 32. Cancer is non-discriminatory--you can get it if you are two years old or 92. I was like an ostrich with its head in the sand,\" she said frankly. If it had been diagnosed earlier it might not have reached stage 3, where it was when she was diagnosed.\n\nShe did not have insurance. One of the wonderful things about the Affordable Care Act is pre-existing conditions are covered so she could get it. Another one is the insurance cannot be capped and she would not be kicked off if she hit $1 million in treatment, the way it was done in the past. The open enrollment day came and she signed up. That was the beginning of April.\n\nThe hardest part was having to wait. She had to wait for the doctor appointment. She was still in her ostrich state but then got in a hurry once the tumor was diagnosed. From the first doctor's appointment to the first chemotherapy was probably three weeks.\n\nFirst she had the port put in next to the aorta and a week later had the first chemo. There are many different chemos but they are very harsh, a poison to the body. The veins are like a stream and the arteries are like a river. The port is put in so the chemo can be placed directly into the body with a needle. It is a lot less painless to go in through a port. She worked on continuing education classes while getting her treatments at East Alabama Medical Center where she had everything done.\n\n\"They are amazing--the nurses and doctors,\" she said. She pays $311 premium but does not get any subsidies. Her deductible is $100 and she has $20 co-pays. Except for the premiums everything is 100 percent paid for, she said.\n\nAfter the chemo, she chose to have a bilateral mastectomy. The cancer was in one breast but she chose the prophylactic surgery for a couple of reasons.\n\nShe was a Double D size and felt once one was removed she would be off balance. She did not want to get cancer in her other breast so she told him to take them both and she decided not to have the reconstruction.\n\n\"It was definitely a personal decision and there is no wrong decision. The reason I didn't reconstruct was the recovering time was longer and there were possible complications,\" she said.\n\nIf in 10 years from now she decided to go through the reconstructive surgery insurance would pay for it. It did not have to be decided right now.\n\nWhen she talked to the plastic surgeon he talked about cutting into healthy parts of her body like cutting into her back to get material for her breasts.\n\n\"What is important to me is to get healthy--not causing more damage,\" she said. Methodically, she takes it one step, one question, one emotion at a time, researching just enough to prepare. She has a team of doctors working to save her life. No amount of Googling can make her smarter than they are, she said, warning men and women to put faith in them and not the Internet.\n\n\"Breasts serve one function--to feed babies--and I don't have any. It is not for anyone to tell me what to do with my breasts but me,\" she said, mentioning that Angelina Jolie had both breasts and ovaries removed proactively because of the deadly gene she carried. She did not have cancer but did not want to risk it with several family members dying of cancer.\n\n\"I have to see the treatment plan through and pray they are as talented as I hope they are and that God will work through them. Obviously, I don't know what is up God's sleeve, but one verse that sums up my day-to-day psychology is Matthew 6:27: \"Which of you, by being anxious, can add one moment to his lifespan?\" which she said was a good point.\n\nShe underwent eight rounds of chemo for 16 weeks, then had a mastectomy. The tumor was seven centimeters. It was huge. Their hope was to shrink the tumor before she had the mastectomy and it did, shrinking it from 7 centimeters to 3 centimeters. August 31 they did the mastectomy. She has about 36 radiation treatments to be given. She said she feels like she is on the backend.\n\nEverybody has their down days. It's faith, family, friends, neighbors--everybody has a way of shining their light, she said. It is humbling how great everyone is around her. She is a positive person, she said. Fretting, complaining and having a bad attitude doesn't help. She recently had a bad day, staying at home on the couch, watching TV, but the next day she got up and got herself together and went out.\n\nA private group on Facebook helps, and others reach out, even strangers, who give her hugs. Several different people have reached out to her, offering their advice. Many understand when you are going through cancer weird things happen to your body.\n\n\"The more people I've told the better I felt. It is a million pounds on your shoulders and you get to share the weight by talking about it--spreading the weight. The more I talk about it the better I feel. I guess it makes it not so scary. The more I talk about it and process it verbally it takes the scary away. It takes the power away,\" she said.\n\nHer dad was with her when they called her back and said the tests were positive for the cancer. They were business-like and immediately wanted to schedule what needed to be done.\n\nFor the first time she thought about her mortality. She thought about the process of dying \"and I had a good old cry.\n\n\"It's non-discriminatory. Cancer does not care if you are two or 92, black or Mexican, Muslim or Christian. Don't make excuses. Go to the doctor and get checked. A lot of insurance does not pay before 40. The medical field for a long time would pay for Viagra but would not pay for birth control for a long time,\" she said.\n\n\"Get it checked out. Zero and stage one are 100 percent curable. They can cure cancer if at zero or stage one and it will not spread and you can live a normal life. Don't risk it,\" she said.\n\n\"Never look back unless you are planning to go that way,\" she said, quoting Henry David Thoreau. After the chemo, the surgery, now she is neutralizing the cancer cells with radiation. It takes one cell to grow a cancerous tumor.\n\n\"A sign at the office is 'Life requires your participation'\" and\n\nthat's true. You have to take the initiative to make sure you're healthy. You need to do self exams,\" she said\n\n\"The Affordable Care Act has been a Godsend to me because of my pre-existing condition. They always said you can't get it (insurance) when you need it but now you can,\" she said.\n\nShe has only been without her breasts about a month. When she gets involved with someone that is something they will have to talk about. But if breasts are the focus she does not want to be with that person, she said.\n\nShe did love her breasts, filling out her shirts, her cleavage, looking nice when she went out, but now she wants to be strong and healthy and whatever wraps that package will be beautiful.\n\nHer grandmother had breast cancer late in life. Several nurses have told her they have had lots of younger women, in their 20s and 30s, come in with breast cancer. They do not know why.\n\nNatalie has changed what she buys in the grocery store, spending a little more to buy organic. She steers clear of chemicals. She still goes to Jon Boy's but she tries to make better decisions in what she buys and in what she eats.\n\nDoing the chemo she did not drink alcohol at all, figuring her liver was under enough stress with it and the drugs used to help with the side effects, such as nausea.\n\nShe sees cancer as an excuse to live, not a reason to die. Some have died young or senselessly from drugs or violence. In a lot of ways cancer is not the worst way to die. Some cancers are curable, some treatable, some terminal.\n\n\"Regardless, cancer affords us and those around us the opportunity to say things that have gone unsaid, an opportunity to condense and carry out our bucket list,\" she said. She would like to travel to a few specific places, talk to old friends more often, read better books... things of that nature \"but the foundation of my life is a strong one with which I'm completely happy,\" she said.\n\nLaughing, she said she feels blessed with the cancer which has opened her eyes and her heart and other people's hearts. What comforted her were \"my mom's reserved panic, my dad's pleas, my sister's jokes, my niece's hugs, my aunt's questions, my friend's tears... I'm loved, and what bigger goal can a person aspire?\"", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "The Randolph Leader", "description": "Natalie Lambert is young but her life could be likened to Frank Sinatra's song, \"I Did It My Way.\"", "title": "Natalie Lambert won't be defined by breast cancer", "url": "http://www.therandolphleader.com/news/article_aeb43338-7278-11e5-ade1-c346b5b41acb.html", "image": {"width": 288, "identifier": "http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/therandolphleader.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/d/68/d68c42e2-7278-11e5-b1f4-d3a5d908e8ad/561e5aff871f0.image.jpg?resize=288%2C277", "height": 277}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@tweetmeme", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Natalie Lambert is young but her life could be likened to Frank Sinatra's song, \"I Did It My Way.\"", "fb": {"app_id": 135817296433862}, "keywords": "news", "news_keywords": "news"}, "article_summary": "Young, vibrant and honest, she has faced breast cancer with a fighting spirit, making her own choices.\nSeveral nurses have told her they have had lots of younger women, in their 20s and 30s, come in with breast cancer.\nAs a breast cancer survivor she more than survives--she lives.\nHer grandmother had breast cancer late in life.\nNatalie Lambert is young but her life could be likened to Frank Sinatra's song, \"I Did It My Way.\""}
