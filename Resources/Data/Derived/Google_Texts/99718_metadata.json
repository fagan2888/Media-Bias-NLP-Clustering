I asked what he would say to Miller if given the chance for a heart-to-heart chat. The answer was blunt. Sharpe would tell Miller: \u201cEnough \u2026 enough with the bull jive.\u201d\n\nIt was compelling stuff. Watch it all in the above video.\n\nSharpe said he would be willing to fly back to Denver to talk with Miller? Do you think that would be a good idea?\n\nKick it with Kiz and Peter Burns by joining the discussion on Mile High Sports Radio Monday through Friday from 7-9 a.m. on The Press Box at The Denver Post or at 93.7 FM and 1510 AM on Mile High Sports Radio.\n\nFind Kiz on Twitter @MarkKiszla.
