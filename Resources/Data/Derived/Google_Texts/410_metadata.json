All decisions were approved by the boards of directors of both Penn Highlands Healthcare and Penn Highlands Clearfield.\n\nBoth boards are representative of the community and are made up of community leaders, business owners and professionals, physicians and other healthcare professionals; all serve in a volunteer capacity.\n\nPenn Highlands Healthcare has been fully transparent with its decisions, including with the board, medical staff, employees, volunteers, the auxiliary, elected leaders and the media, all in an effort to explain every action that has been taken.\n\nTo reiterate from past communications for those who are still unclear as to the challenges Penn Highlands is facing \u2013 steep decreases in inpatient volumes, shorter lengths of stay, reduced reimbursement from government and private insurers and a sustained shift toward outpatient procedures have significantly reduced hospital revenues.\n\nThese decreases have not only been seen at Penn Highlands\u2019 facilities, but statewide and across the country. According to Hospital Council of Western Pennsylvania, hospital inpatient admissions for western Pennsylvania decreased 1.67 percent for the first 6 months of Fiscal Year 2015. This is a continuing trend, having had a decrease of 3.24 percent throughout Fiscal Year 2014.\n\nFurther, one-third of Pennsylvania\u2019s hospitals lost money last year, according to a recent report by Pennsylvania Health Care Cost Containment Council.\n\nMany of these challenges are attributable to healthcare reform and have resulted in mergers, acquisitions and the need for hospitals and health systems to fundamentally change the way they do business.\n\nAt the same time, expenses associated with providing medical care continue to increase, as does uncompensated care, which is the total amount of healthcare services provided to patients who are either unable or unwilling to pay. Last year, Penn Highlands Clearfield\u2019s uncompensated care alone totaled $4.1 million.\n\nAll of these factors led to a bottom line loss of $4.7 million at Penn Highlands Clearfield in Fiscal Year 2014. In total, Penn Highlands Clearfield has lost more than $28 million since 2008.\n\nThe goal of the restructuring process at Penn Highlands Clearfield is to bring the hospital back to profitability so reinvestment can be made in the hospital and, therefore, in the community. Realigning resources, while protecting patient access by combining local and regional healthcare resources, will help to meet that goal.\n\nWhile Penn Highlands Clearfield has experienced challenging times, the hospital is looking toward the future with optimism.\n\nAs part of its 2015-16 strategic plan, Penn Highlands Healthcare plans to implement a number of initiatives designed to expand patients\u2019 access to physician specialists and mid-level practitioners.\n\nRecruiting physicians to rural communities is a challenge as there is a nationwide physician shortage, but Penn Highlands Healthcare realized much success during the past year in recruiting a number of new physicians, including cardiovascular surgeons, orthopedic surgeons, family practitioners and women\u2019s care specialists.\n\nIn 2014 alone, Penn Highlands Clearfield added several new physicians to its staff, including Dr. Wilkerson Compere, an internal medicine physician; Dr. Traceyan Mendez, a family practice physician; Dr. Maofu Fu, medical oncologist at the Nathaniel D. Yingling, M.D., Cancer Center; Drs. Naehal Marra and Mary Clare Ocampo, pediatricians; and Drs. Clifford Neal and David Bundy, emergency medicine specialists.\n\nAt least three new physicians will be joining Penn Highlands Clearfield this summer.\n\nWorking with the Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine, Penn Highlands Healthcare plans to establish a Graduate Medical Education Program with residency programs in internal medicine, family practice, emergency medicine and surgery.\n\nPenn Highlands will also be working with several medical schools to facilitate the rotation of medical students at all four of the system\u2019s hospitals. By serving as a pathway for medical students, Penn Highlands hopes to encourage these students to remain and practice in the region.\n\nIn addition to adding more healthcare providers, Penn Highlands Healthcare plans to launch several initiatives at Penn Highlands Clearfield that will help redefine the hospital\u2019s mission, improve customer service, enhance quality and increase access to care.\n\nThese plans include a new pain clinic, a new outpatient diagnostic center and walk-in clinic on the Clearfield campus, a new outpatient medical building in Moshannon Valley, quality initiatives and updates to the emergency department, among others.\n\nAll of these initiatives represent a significant investment by Penn Highlands Healthcare in the Clearfield and Moshannon Valley markets. Further, the health system has been awarded approximately $3 million in grant funding to offset the cost of the Moshannon Valley project, and has secured an additional $4 million in financing to invest in upgrades and initiatives at the Clearfield campus.\n\nAs for Wednesday\u2019s meeting, Penn Highlands Healthcare is disappointed that there were inaccurate statements made during the meeting, but looks forward to the opportunity to address those issues going forward.\n\nPenn Highlands Clearfield remains a full-functioning community hospital providing most primary and secondary services, safely caring for and treating thousands of patients, employing nearly 400, with more than 100 physicians on staff and generating $105 million annually in the regional economy.", "article_metadata": {"framework": "Alkivia Framework 0.8", "description": "CLEARFIELD - The administration and board of directors of both Penn Highlands Healthcare and Penn Highlands Clearfield understand the community is concerned", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "CLEARFIELD \u2013 The administration and board of directors of both Penn Highlands Healthcare and Penn Highlands Clearfield understand the community is concerned about the healthcare environment and the changes that have been implemented at Penn Highlands Clearfield.\nAll decisions were approved by the boards of directors of both Penn Highlands Healthcare and Penn Highlands Clearfield.\nAll of these factors led to a bottom line loss of $4.7 million at Penn Highlands Clearfield in Fiscal Year 2014.\nAll of these initiatives represent a significant investment by Penn Highlands Healthcare in the Clearfield and Moshannon Valley markets.\nAs for Wednesday\u2019s meeting, Penn Highlands Healthcare is disappointed that there were inaccurate statements made during the meeting, but looks forward to the opportunity to address those issues going forward."}
