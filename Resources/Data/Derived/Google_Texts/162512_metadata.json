But he now wants the top income tax rate cut in half.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nHe opposed the war in Iraq, but says he now has a \u201c foolproof\u201d plan to defeat ISIL.\n\nHe\u2019s praised single-payer health care, yet loathes Obamacare. But a decade ago he proposed \u201chealth marts\u201d that sound suspiciously like today\u2019s Obamacare exchanges.\n\nOver the past two decades he was a Republican, then an independent, then a Democrat, then a Republican. Now, registered as an independent, he leads the Republican 2016 presidential field.\n\nBut what does Donald Trump really believe on policy? It\u2019s hard to tell \u2014 his campaign will identify no policy director, he has no \u201cissues\u201d tab on his campaign website and he hasn\u2019t given any substantive policy speeches on the campaign trail.\n\n\u201cHis hair has been more permanent than his political positions,\u201d said Thomas P. Miller, a health care policy expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. \u201cIt\u2019s a total random assortment of whatever plays publicly.\u201d\n\nVoters are drawn to Trump more for his I\u2019ll-say-anything style than for his policy views. But a close inspection of Trump\u2019s two published policy tomes, \u201cThe America We Deserve\u201d (2000) and \u201cTime To Get Tough\u201d (2011), along with Trump\u2019s public statements in interviews, on Twitter and in public appearances, indicate that Trump\u2019s policy preferences are eclectic, improvisational and often contradictory.\n\nSome of his policy stances are flatout disqualifying to the Republican establishment, but that doesn\u2019t seem to matter. The inconsistencies may even be an asset in assembling a coalition.\n\nTo a large extent Trump\u2019s policy contradictions reflect his rapidly shifting political alliances over the past 15 years.\n\nIn 1999, Trump quit the Republican Party, saying \u201cI just believe the Republicans are just too crazy right.\u201d Trump was then conferring with political consultant Roger Stone about a possible presidential run as a candidate of the Reform Party, the political organization founded by his fellow billionaire Ross Perot.\n\nIn 2001, Trump quit the Reform Party to register as a Democrat. \u201cIt just seems that the economy does better under Democrats,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer in 2004. The Clintons attended Trump\u2019s Palm Beach wedding to former model Melania Knaus in 2005. The following year Trump gave $26,000 to the House and Senate campaign committees.\n\nBy the late aughts, though, Trump\u2019s political giving had started shifting back to the GOP, and in 2009 Trump registered again as a Republican. Two years later he registered as an independent while contemplating a third-party bid.\n\nIt was during Trump\u2019s leftward drift in 1999 that he first proposed a wealth tax \u2014 a one-time 14.25 percent levy on fortunes more than $10 million that inequality guru Thomas Piketty might salivate over. \u201cThe concept of a one-time tax on the super-wealthy is something he feels strongly about,\u201d Stone told the Los Angeles Times.\n\nTrump said the tax should be used to pay off the national debt and help bolster the Social Security fund. He criticized presidential candidate Steve Forbes for favoring a flat tax, which Trump thought unfair to the poor. \u201cOnly the wealthy would reap a windfall,\u201d Trump wrote in his 2000 book.\n\nTrump never disavowed the wealth tax, and his campaign won\u2019t say whether he still favors it. But the soak-the-rich tax went unmentioned in his 2011 book. Indeed, even as Trump excoriated President Barack Obama for \u201cadding more to the national debt in three years than almost all the other United States presidents combined.\u201d Trump offered no specific proposals to address it.\n\nTrump overcame his moral objections to the flat tax. On April 15, he told Fox News that he\u2019d like to replace the income tax with \u201ceither a fair tax\u201d (i.e., a national sales tax), \u201ca flat tax or certainly a simplified code.\u201d He also proposes repealing the corporate income tax because, he wrote in his 2011 book, it would \u201ccreate an unprecedented jobs boom.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s nothing if not inconsistent,\u201d said Bruce Bartlett, a onetime tax aide to the late Rep. Jack Kemp (R.-N.Y.) who excoriated Trump\u2019s wealth tax 16 years ago in the Wall Street Journal. \u201cHe\u2019s been on every side of every issue from every point of view as far as I can tell.\u201d\n\nIn the 2011 book, Trump outlined a radically simplified income tax reducing the current seven tax brackets to four, with a top marginal rate of 15 percent for incomes above $1 million. (The top rate now is 39.6 percent, which kicks in at less than half a million.) Last month, the liberal nonprofit Citizens for Tax Justice said this \u201cwould provide the wealthy with huge tax cuts.\u201d Taken in their entirety, CTJ concluded, Trump\u2019s more recent tax proposals would \u201ccreate a multi-trillion dollar hole in the federal budget that Trump has not outlined any substantial plan to fill.\u201d\n\nIn Trump\u2019s 2000 book he wrote, \u201cI generally oppose gun control, but I support the ban on assault weapons and I also support a slightly longer waiting period to purchase a gun.\u201d But earlier this month Trump told the Web site Ammoland, \u201cGun-banners are unfortunately preoccupied with \u2026 magazine capacity, grips and other aesthetics, precisely because of its popularity. To the left every weapon is an assault weapon.\u201d Trump also said: \u201cI do not support expanding background checks. The current background checks do not work.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s 2011 book also condemned the \u201crapid expansion of food stamps\u201d under Obama and endorses mandatory drug tests for welfare recipients.\n\nThe most dramatic disconnect between turn-of-the-century Trump and Trump 2016 concerns health care. In the 2000 volume, Trump pronounced himself \u201ca liberal\u201d when it comes to health care because it is \u201cunacceptable \u2026 that the number of uninsured Americans has risen to forty-two million.\u201d The solution? \u201cWhile we work out details of a new single-payer plan,\u201d Trump wrote, the country ought to consider a variety of ways to make the current system \u201cwork more efficiently.\u201d Among these was \u201cthe idea of [tax-subsidized] health marts\u201d that \u201cwould create a group of approved plans for employees or independents to select from,\u201d i.e., Obamacare without the individual mandate.\n\nBut in the 2011 volume, Trump complained that Obamacare was a scheme by liberals \u201cto drag America closer to a so-called \u2018single-payer system,\u2019 otherwise known as total government-run health care.\u201d Trump expressed doubt that the number of uninsured (by then 46 million) was accurate, and questioned whether any effort should be made to cover them. He wrote that 20 percent aren\u2019t even U.S. citizens (Undocumented workers, he failed to note, are Obamacare-ineligible.); 30 percent \u201chave plenty of money to buy health care\u201d because they earn more than $75,000; and 28 percent are young people who may \u201cneed a safety net\u201d but don\u2019t justify jeopardizing what he\u2019s come to regard as \u201cthe world\u2019s greatest health-care system.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a longstanding conservative claim, that the uninsured [rate] is inflated,\u201d said Edwin Park, vice president for health policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. \u201cThere\u2019s no disputing that there were tens of millions of uninsured.\u201d\n\nIn some ways, Trump has always been eclectic in his views. As Perot-ista, Democrat and Republican/independent he\u2019s been a rhetorical hawk \u2014 though one consistently reluctant to endorse military intervention. He worries about \u201cChina\u2019s aggressive military buildup\u201d but expresses puzzlement that nearly 30,000 U.S. troops should remain in South Korea. Every American family that loses a family member in Iraq, Trump believes, should receive $5 million from the U.S. government, and Iraq veterans should receive $2 million. But \u201cif any country in the Middle East won\u2019t sell us their oil at fair market price \u2014 oil that we discovered, we pumped and we made profitable for the countries of the Middle East in the first place \u2014 we have every right to take it.\u201d\n\nTrump has been consistent over time both in his opposition to the inheritance tax \u2014 he\u2019s been calling for its repeal for a decade and a half \u2014 and in his support for private-sector unions. \u201cUnions still have a place in American society,\u201d he wrote in 2000. \u201cIn fact, with the globalization craze in full heat, unions are about the only political force reminding us to remember the American working family.\u201d Trump singled out Teamsters President Jim Hoffa for particular praise: \u201cHis knees don\u2019t jerk, and if anyone knows how to bring the Teamsters back to their rightful place at the table, Jim is that man.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s uncharacteristic moderation about non-public labor unions reflects his occupational need, as a real estate developer operating in the Northeast, to get along with them. Bob McDevitt, president of UNITE HERE! Local 54 in Atlantic City, said \u201cthere has never been any kind of evidence of any kind of union animus with any of the entities he operated\u201d there.\n\nGiven an opportunity earlier this month to revise his view of unions, Trump did not. \u201cI have great relationships with unions,\u201d he told Newsweek\u2019s Matthew Cooper. Trump is himself a union member, collecting a $110,228 annual pension from the Screen Actors Guild, according to his financial disclosure. Cooper has written that the influx of white working-class voters into the GOP since 2000 makes Trump\u2019s eclecticism not a weakness, but a strength, because Trump aligns with their opposition to trade deals and cutting Social Security and Medicare.\n\nIn May, Trump appeared in an Americans for Limited Government radio ad in which he called fast-track and the Trans Pacific Partnership \u201ca bad, bad deal for American businesses, for workers, for taxpayers\u201d and \u201ca huge set of hand-outs for a few insiders that don\u2019t even care about our great, great America.\u201d In his announcement speech, Trump proposed a 35 percent tax on \u201cevery car and every truck and every part\u201d manufactured by American automakers in Mexico that crosses into the U.S. Trump also favors a 20 percent tariff on all imported goods and a 15 percent tax \u201cfor outsourcing jobs.\u201d\n\nBut even in 2000, Trump had a low regard for teacher\u2019s unions, who he wrote \u201cblow smoke about professional this and academic that\u201d and stifle competition by resisting school choice options. Trump would also appear to share fellow GOP candidate Scott Walker\u2019s disdain for public employee unions in general, having donated $15,000 during Walker\u2019s 2012 recall fight to the Wisconsin Club for Growth, which opposed it. \u201cI believed what he was doing was the right thing,\u201d Trump said.\n\nTrump parts with liberals in opposing an increase in the minimum wage, and, of course, in his fierce opposition to any path to citizenship for undocumented workers. He also calls climate change a \u201c total hoax.\u201d But while he favors spending cuts he opposes altering the two largest entitlement programs, Social Security and Medicare.\n\n\u201cIf you think you\u2019re going to change very substantially for the worse Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security in any substantial way,\u201d Trump said at the 2013 Conservative Political Action conference, \u201cand at the same time you think you\u2019re going to win elections, it just really is not going to happen.\u201d\n\nMatt Daily, Paul Demko, Jennifer Judson, Matthew Korade, Brian Mahoney, Jason Millman, Katy O\u2019Donnell and Ben White contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "He's been a Republican, then an independent, then a Democrat, then a Republican.", "og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "He's been a Republican, then an independent, then a Democrat, then a Republican.", "title": "Will the real Donald Trump please stand up?", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/will-the-real-donald-trump-please-stand-up-120607.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/07/24/150723_trump_ap3_1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "keywords": "Policy,Donald Trump,2016 Elections,Donald Trump 2016", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/timothy.noah"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The most dramatic disconnect between turn-of-the-century Trump and Trump 2016 concerns health care.\nGiven an opportunity earlier this month to revise his view of unions, Trump did not.\n\u201cOnly the wealthy would reap a windfall,\u201d Trump wrote in his 2000 book.\nBy the late aughts, though, Trump\u2019s political giving had started shifting back to the GOP, and in 2009 Trump registered again as a Republican.\n\u201cHis hair has been more permanent than his political positions,\u201d said Thomas P.
