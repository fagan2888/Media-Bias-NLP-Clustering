Dannel Malloy (file)\n\nHARTFORD, Conn. (WTNH)\u2013 A new law that will allow people here illegally to get a Connecticut driver\u2019s license is already controversial.\n\nBut News 8 has learned that the \u2018roll out\u2019 of the first phase of the new program has been postponed until after the election.\n\n\u2018I certainly had nothing to do with the delay,\u201d said Governor Malloy. \u201cNo one in your office, your chief of staff, anyone?\u201d asked Chief Political Correspondent Mark Davis. \u201cYou know\u2026not that I know of,\u201d said the governor.\n\nBut a highly reliable government source tells News 8 that the delay of the roll out of the immigrant driver\u2019s license program was done because someone in the Malloy administration did not want the adverse publicity that might occur during the campaign.\n\nLINK: Drive Only License Program\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re asking me: \u2018Do I want a repeat of the national Obamacare,\u2019 no I want a repeat of the Connecticut Obamacare which was the most successful in the nation,\u201d said the governor.\n\nApplications for appointments for \u2018Learner\u2019s Permits\u2019 were scheduled to be available on the DMV website starting next week but that\u2019s been postponed until December 1st, after the election.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to do more structural testing of the internet, the website, to make sure it could handle the volume that\u2019s expected,\u201d said DMV. Deputy Commissioner Victor Diaz.\n\nThe DMV\u2019s website is already the busiest in state government. Expected requests for \u2018Drive Only\u2019 immigrant licenses are estimated to to be somewhere between 50,000 and 200,000.\n\nIn addition to the thousands of Connecticut residents that line up at DMV offices around the state each week, starting in January thousands more will be added to mix that\u2019s because the Governor and General Assembly have passed a law allowing those who do not have U.S. Citizenship documentation people here illegally will be able to get what\u2019s called a \u2018Drive Only\u2019 driver\u2019s license.\n\nIt\u2019s supposed to make driving on the road in Connecticut safer for everyone because those here illegally will be able to legally register their cars and trucks and buy insurance. DMV has been doing some outreach to the immigrant population on this and we\u2019re told that at a meeting in Danbury over the weekend DMV was expecting about 500 people and about 900 showed up.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new law that will allow people here illegally to get a Connecticut driver's license is already controversial.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=488522642", "og": {"site_name": "WTNH Connecticut News", "description": "A new law that will allow people here illegally to get a Connecticut driver\u2019s license is already controversial.", "title": "Controversy over immigrant driver\u2019s license program", "url": "http://wtnh.com/2014/08/25/controversy-over-immigrant-drivers-license-program/", "image": {"width": 510, "identifier": "https://lintvwtnh.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/malloy.jpg", "height": 286}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A new law that will allow people here illegally to get a Connecticut driver\u2019s license is already controversial.", "title": "Controversy over immigrant driver\u2019s license program", "image": {"src": "https://lintvwtnh.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/malloy.jpg?w=640"}, "creator": "@WTNH", "site": "@wtnh", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Connecticut, Connecticut and National Politics, Hartford County, Connecticut News, News, Top Video,Mark Davis", "msapplication-tooltip": "Connecticut News, CT Weather, Conn Traffic and Roads", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.linmedia.newstouch.wtnh", "fb": {"pages": 48010180735}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wtnh.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/4eb8f03fcc8a8756ac275dd34c27b214?s=16", "application-name": "WTNH Connecticut News", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WTNH8", "published_time": "2014-08-25T21:17:05+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-25T21:17:05+00:00"}, "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "google-site-verification": "ZhFDO7qoefSEo7HNtJIuKwhzd9Scb3I7EiPvU_GALiE", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Dannel Malloy (file)HARTFORD, Conn.
