A new survey from payroll services giant ADP reveals that about 40 percent of mid-sized and large companies that are offering health coverage to workers aren't familiar with two new Obamacare-related forms that must be filed with the Internal Revenue Service starting this tax season.

"That's a bit concerning," said Vic Saliterman, ADP senior vice president and general manager for health-care reform.

The forms — the 1094-C and the 1095-C — are designed to track compliance with the Obamacare rule that mid- to large-sized employers offer affordable health insurance to workers or face a fine.

The 1094-C forms will be used by companies to indicate to the IRS where they've complied with that rule, and 1095-C forms will indicate whether a worker and his dependents have received job-based health coverage.

ADP, which provides outsourced payroll and human resources management services, found that even when companies knew about the forms, not all of them have been compiling the often-complicated data to complete them.
