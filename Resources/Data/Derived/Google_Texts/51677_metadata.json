Embarking on his fifth State of the Union address, with the lowest approval ratings (forty-three per cent, according to Gallup) of any second-term Oval Office occupant at this point in a Presidency since Richard Nixon, President Obama eschewed the grand pledges that he had made last year to move forward with gun-control legislation, immigration reform, climate-change policy, and tax reform. This year, the first three of those topics got one paragraph each\u2014and tax reform was hardly mentioned.\n\nInstead, the President talked about how \u201cinequality has deepened\u201d and \u201cupward mobility has stalled.\u201d He put forth a series of modest proposals designed to provide \u201cladders of opportunity into the middle class,\u201d such as raising the minimum wage for federal contract workers. And he expressed his determination to enact some reforms without congressional approval, saying, \u201cAmerica does not stand still, and neither will I.\u201d\n\nTo that point, it was pretty much what the advance leaks had indicated: a determined rearguard action from a President who knows that he is down, and who needs a political strategy that can take him and his party through an election year, until, hopefully, a resurgent economy rescues them both. Prone to occasional lapses into passivity and fatalism, here he was sharp, feisty, and funny. This was the Obama of the second 2012 Presidential debate, not the first one.\n\nHe castigated the Republicans for depriving \u201chardworking, responsible Americans\u201d of the chance to receive extended unemployment benefits while looking for a new job. To support his case, he pointed to one such woman, Misty DeMars, who was conveniently sitting in the gallery. DeMars is a college-educated mother of two who lost her job last year. Obama delivered a strong, and much needed, defense of the Affordable Care Act, invoking another White House invitee, Amanda Shelley, who signed up for her new health coverage on January 1st, got sick two days later, and needed emergency surgery on January 3rd. Obama even elicited a quick thumbs-up from John Boehner by pointing out how \u201cthe son of a barkeeper is the Speaker of the House.\u201d (It is not to be doubted that some Tea Party members in Ohio are already planning a primary challenge.)\n\nBut it was toward the end of the speech, when Obama made the customary pivot to foreign affairs and national-security issues, that the real drama occurred. A tipoff had come from an article at the Daily Beast on Tuesday, which was written by Jon Favreau, the speechwriter who worked on Obama\u2019s previous State of the Union addresses. It explained how much time and effort that the President\u2019s staff would put into finding \u201cordinary Americans whose lives touch us in extraordinary ways.\u201d Favreau went on: \u201cThis is President Obama\u2019s favorite part, too\u2014particularly the story that\u2019s often told to conclude the speech. My old boss is a sucker for good endings, and he would send us far and wide to find just the right anecdote.\u201d\n\nThe subject of this year\u2019s concluding story was Army Sergeant First Class Cory Remsburg, a Ranger who first met the President in 2009, at Omaha Beach, on the sixty-fifth anniversary of D Day. In Obama\u2019s telling, Remsburg helped walk him through the program, joked around, took photographs, and left the impression that he was \u201ca strong, impressive young man, with an easy manner, sharp as a tack.\u201d Just a few months later, the President went on, \u201con his tenth deployment, Cory was nearly killed by a massive roadside bomb in Afghanistan. His comrades found him in a canal, face down, underwater, shrapnel in his brain.\u201d\n\nEven through the television screen, you could almost hear the nervous intake of breath inside the packed chamber. Remsburg was sitting in the gallery too, of course, wearing his full ceremonial uniform, squeezed between his gray-haired father, Craig, and Michelle Obama. As the President explained what Remsburg had subsequently been through\u2014a coma, ten surgeries, the loss of his voice, blindness in one eye, the loss of movement, and \u201cyears of gruelling rehab\u201d to regain some of his faculties\u2014the wounded soldier looked gamely ahead, the rigors of his experience plainly visible on his face and head. And after Obama said, \u201cCory is here tonight\u2026. Sergeant First Class Cory Remsburg never gives up, and he does not quit,\u201d Remsburg pulled himself to his feet, with a bit of assistance from his dad, and acknowledged the thunderous applause that went on for minutes, and was quite unlike anything that had been heard previously.\n\nThe President and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Remsburg\u2019s ultimate commanding officers\u2014the men who had overseen his deployment in Afghanistan\u2014were on their feet, staring up at him and applauding. So were the five Supreme Court Justices who showed up. And so were the members of the Cabinet, White House staff members, and, of course, the assembled senators and congressmen. Remsburg waved his one good arm, tried his best to smile, and got a quick rub on the back from the First Lady. Truly, it was hard to watch. But it was even harder to look away.\n\nWhat did it all signify?\n\nOn one level, of course, it was a political ploy\u2014a fiendishly effective way to leave us with something else to talk about than an embattled President defending his policies and seeking to turn the conversation from whether he\u2019s a lame duck. But it was also something bigger and more justifiable. Obama\u2019s speechwriters and spinmeisters didn\u2019t pull Remsburg\u2019s name from a hat. A 2013 piece in the Times reported that the President had met him twice since the D Day celebrations\u2014once at a military hospital near Washington and then at a high school in Phoenix. This was their fourth encounter.\n\nEver since he ran for President, in 2008, Obama\u2019s underlying message has been that too much of what happens in Washington is an insiders\u2019 game that ignores, and often tramples upon, the wishes and interests of ordinary Americans. By inviting Remsburg\u2014and DeMars and Shelley, too\u2014Obama was taking part in what\u2019s now a traditional ritual for speech-givers. But he was also trying to bridge the gaping chasm between politics and political decision-making as experienced by its practitioners in the nation\u2019s capital and by the grunts out there in the factories, offices, and Army battalions.\n\nHe was also invoking the concept of public service, which, in Washington these days, is routinely subjugated to partisan advantage. And, finally, he was saying that we can do better, and we know we can\u2014just look at this young man.\n\n\u201cNone of it is easy,\u201d Obama said. \u201cBut if we work together; if we summon what is best in us, the way Cory summoned what is best in him, with our feet planted firmly in today but our eyes cast towards tomorrow, I know it\u2019s within our reach.\u201d In a bitterly divided chamber, and a bitterly divided country, it was a fanciful vision to end the speech with. For a moment, though, you got the sense that even the President\u2019s foes gathered before him couldn\u2019t have disagreed with his sentiments.\n\nRead the rest of our State of the Union coverage: Jeff Shesol on executive orders, Amy Davidson on Cory Remsburg and the meaning of war, Evan Ratliff on the many scandals of Michael Grimm, and a live chat about the speech with Davidson, Steve Coll, Rebecca Mead, and Evan Osnos.\n\nPhotograph by Alex Wong/Getty.", "article_metadata": {"cache-version": 20160526204643, "description": "It was when Obama pivoted to foreign affairs and national-security issues that the real drama occurred.", "account-url": "https://account.newyorker.com", "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "og": {"site_name": "The New Yorker", "description": "It was when Obama pivoted to foreign affairs and national-security issues that the real drama occurred.", "title": "The Meaning of Cory Remsburg - The New Yorker", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 580, "identifier": "http://www.newyorker.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/cass-sotu.jpg", "height": 414}, "updated_time": "2014-07-16T15:39:05-04:00", "url": "http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-meaning-of-cory-remsburg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "It was when Obama pivoted to foreign affairs and national-security issues that the real drama occurred.", "creator": "@JohnCassidy", "image": "http://www.newyorker.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/cass-sotu.jpg", "title": "The Meaning of Cory Remsburg - The New Yorker", "site": "@newyorker", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The New Yorker", "robots": "noodp", "parsely-metadata": "{\"id\":\"1636771\",\"title_alt\":\"The Meaning of Cory Remsburg\",\"featured_image_url\":\"http:\\/\\/www.newyorker.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2014\\/01\\/cass-sotu-580-375.jpg\"}", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "environment": "prod", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1081530898", "fb": {"admins": 757909316}, "article": {"section": "John Cassidy", "tag": "State of the Union", "published_time": "2014-01-29T01:28:56-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-16T15:39:05-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "_jvLA9pRQom0-f6587wRKrNwfRtqyKzjfYWvwcZ5fxc", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "id": 1636771, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0", "news_keywords": "Obama, State of the Union"}, "article_summary": "Sergeant First Class Cory Remsburg never gives up, and he does not quit,\u201d Remsburg pulled himself to his feet, with a bit of assistance from his dad, and acknowledged the thunderous applause that went on for minutes, and was quite unlike anything that had been heard previously.\nRead the rest of our State of the Union coverage: Jeff Shesol on executive orders, Amy Davidson on Cory Remsburg and the meaning of war, Evan Ratliff on the many scandals of Michael Grimm, and a live chat about the speech with Davidson, Steve Coll, Rebecca Mead, and Evan Osnos.\nRemsburg was sitting in the gallery too, of course, wearing his full ceremonial uniform, squeezed between his gray-haired father, Craig, and Michelle Obama.\nRemsburg waved his one good arm, tried his best to smile, and got a quick rub on the back from the First Lady.\nAnd after Obama said, \u201cCory is here tonight\u2026."}
