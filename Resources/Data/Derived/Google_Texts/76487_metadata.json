He believes in not only erring on the side of life, but also minimizing any pain that may be caused to an unborn child,\" a spokesman for Republican Governor Gary Herbert said in a statement.\n\nSupporters of the bill and anti-abortion groups say that around the 20th week of pregnancy a fetus can feel physical pain, and anesthesia can eliminate discomfort.\n\nReproductive health advocates, including Planned Parenthood of Utah, told the Tribune the position is scientifically unproven and lawmakers have inserted politics into a private medical matter.\n\nUnder the new law, doctors performing abortions would be required to administer anesthesia to women seeking an elective abortion around 20 weeks. Previous state law gave women the choice whether or not to opt for anesthesia.\n\nAbortions are prohibited in Utah after the point when the fetus is viable, which is around 22 weeks.\n\nThe law will not affect a large number of women, the Tribune reported, with 17 women in Utah receiving abortions at 20 weeks of pregnancy or later in 2014, it said.\n\nRepublican state Senator Curt Bramble, who sponsored the bill, had originally wanted to ban abortions after 20 weeks but was told the move would be unconstitutional, the Salt Lake Tribune reported.\n\n(Reporting by Victoria Cavaliere in New York; Editing by Richard Pullin)", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "utah, governor, signs, anesthesia, requirement, abortions", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Utah's governor on Monday signed a bill requiring doctors to administer anesthesia to women receiving an abortion at the 20th week of gestation, his office said.", "title": "Utah Governor Signs Anesthesia Requirement For Some Abortions", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/utah-governor-signs-anesthesia-requirement-abortions-379829", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/03/29/gary-herbert.JPG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Utah's governor on Monday signed a bill requiring doctors to administer anesthesia to women receiving an abortion at the 20th week of gestation, his office said.", "title": "Utah Governor Signs Anesthesia Requirement For Some Abortions", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/utah-governor-signs-anesthesia-requirement-abortions-379829", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/03/29/gary-herbert.JPG", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/03/29/gary-herbert.JPG"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Hill", "published_time": "2016-03-29T09:21:31-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-29T09:39:05-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Utah's governor on Monday signed a bill requiring doctors to administer anesthesia to women receiving an abortion at the 20th week of gestation, his office said."}, "article_summary": "Under the new law, doctors performing abortions would be required to administer anesthesia to women seeking an elective abortion around 20 weeks.\nAbortions are prohibited in Utah after the point when the fetus is viable, which is around 22 weeks.\nUtah's governor on Monday signed a bill requiring doctors to administer anesthesia to women receiving an abortion at the 20th week of gestation, his office said.\nThe law will not affect a large number of women, the Tribune reported, with 17 women in Utah receiving abortions at 20 weeks of pregnancy or later in 2014, it said.\nPrevious state law gave women the choice whether or not to opt for anesthesia."}
