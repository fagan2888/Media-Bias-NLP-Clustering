Mary Fallin says. GOP govs: Scant Hobby Lobby political fallout\n\nNASHVILLE \u2014 Democrats see the Supreme Court decision of limiting birth control coverage in some employee health plans as galvanizing voters for November, but Republican governors say the Hobby Lobby case is barely a blip, let alone a reprise of the \u201cwar on women.\u201d\n\nRepublicans interviewed at the National Governors Association summer meeting here this weekend described the high court ruling exempting some religious owners of for-profit businesses from the Obamacare contraceptive coverage requirement as a welcome brake on President Barack Obama and his intrusive health law. And they didn\u2019t see it causing problems.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie when asked if he was concerned that some New Jersey women could lose birth control coverage.\n\n( QUIZ: How well do you know Chris Christie?)\n\nAsked why not, he added, \u201cBecause I\u2019m not.\u201d\n\nThe response from the GOP governors \u2014 including some like Christie and Scott Walker of Wisconsin who are seen as possible contenders for the party\u2019s 2016 presidential nomination \u2014 was much more low-key than that of congressional Democrats. Hill Democrats have already introduced a bill to restore the contraception coverage requirement, basically by carving out a health insurance exception to a religious freedom law that was at the heart of the Hobby Lobby legal argument. They may bring the legislation to the Senate floor as early as this week.\n\nA Democratic bill on contraception won\u2019t pass the GOP-led House but the Democrats see the fight as reigniting the \u201cwar on women\u201d theme in the 2014 election season, and possibly motivating more single women to turn out in close Senate races like Colorado and North Carolina.\n\nRepublicans contend that the Supreme Court\u2019s June 30 ruling in Hobby Lobby v. Burwell \u2014 simply that family-owned companies can\u2019t be forced to include free contraception in employee health plans in violation of their religious beliefs \u2014 is a win for religious freedom.\n\n( WATCH: Nancy Pelosi: Americans should be 'afraid' of Hobby Lobby ruling)\n\nRepublicans also said the court had limited the Hobby Lobby case\u2019s scope. The ruling applies to \u201cclosely held\u201d businesses such as the family-owned Hobby Lobby craft stores, and the majority of justices said the ruling applied only to contraception, not other health services. The liberals who dissented saw the ruling as potentially far more sweeping.\n\nAdvocates for broader access to reproductive health services say they are worried that thousands of women at family-owned companies could be in jeopardy of losing access to contraception services.\n\nThe governors here say they just haven\u2019t witnessed any of the uproar that accompanied the ruling in Washington.\n\n\u201cIt really hasn\u2019t been an issue for us just because it\u2019s a federal decision,\u201d said Wisconsin\u2019s Walker. \u201cHonestly, we haven\u2019t heard much of anything at the state level out on the street from people we bumped into and talked to. I\u2019m not on the court and I\u2019m not in the federal government so I don\u2019t really get involved with it.\u201d\n\nMore than half the states, including Wisconsin and New Jersey, already require insurers to cover contraception prescriptions or related services for women, although some offer religious or moral exemptions, according to the Guttmacher Institute. Although the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling didn\u2019t directly affect those laws, it\u2019s unclear just a few weeks after the Hobby Lobby opinion how many companies will seek religious exemptions from the Obamacare requirement and how many women would be affected.\n\nOklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin, a Republican whose state is home to Hobby Lobby, told POLITICO that affected women have \u201cother alternatives, like Planned Parenthood\u201d to get covered. She pointed out that Hobby Lobby only objected to providing four of the 24 types of FDA-approved contraceptives.\n\n\u201c[Women] still will have access,\u201d she said. \u201cThey can still go out and do that legally in the United States.\u201d\n\nDemocratic governors have largely supported efforts by allies in Congress to undo the effects of the Hobby Lobby ruling. Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper praised his home state senator, Mark Udall, for taking the lead on Senate Democrats\u2019 response. \u201cSen. Udall has always been good on those things,\u201d he said. Udall is in a tight reelection race this November against Rep. Cory Gardner, who praised the Hobby Lobby ruling and then called on the FDA to allow birth control pills to be sold over the counter.\n\nThe conflict is already playing out in at least one gubernatorial contest. Charlie Baker, the front-runner for the GOP nomination in deep-blue Massachusetts, recently contended the Hobby Lobby ruling \u201cdoesn\u2019t matter\u201d to women in his state, where a contraception coverage requirement is already in place. After Democrats pounced, Baker, who supports abortion rights, said he \u201c misspoke,\u201d according to The Boston Globe. He said that if elected he would set aside $300,000 in state funds to protect contraceptive services for what he said was a small number of Massachusetts women who could be affected by the federal ruling.\n\nOther Republicans haven\u2019t felt pressure to take any similar steps. Asked whether he\u2019s worried about the implications for Iowa women, Gov. Terry Branstad, replied, \u201cNo. We think the court made a good decision.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Catholic, I want religious freedom,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a limited decision and \u2026 we think that the president has overstepped his bounds and that the court decision was appropriate.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "They say that they haven\u2019t witnessed any of the uproar that accompanied the ruling in Washington.", "title": "GOP govs: Scant Hobby Lobby political fallout", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/07/hobby-lobby-supreme-court-ruling-108858.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/06/30/140630_hobby_lobby_supreme_court_ap_605.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Republican Governors,Hobby Lobby Case,Governors", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "They say that they haven\u2019t witnessed any of the uproar that accompanied the ruling in Washington.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7e48\"", "article_summary": "( WATCH: Nancy Pelosi: Americans should be 'afraid' of Hobby Lobby ruling)Republicans also said the court had limited the Hobby Lobby case\u2019s scope.\nShe pointed out that Hobby Lobby only objected to providing four of the 24 types of FDA-approved contraceptives.\n\u201cThey can still go out and do that legally in the United States.\u201dDemocratic governors have largely supported efforts by allies in Congress to undo the effects of the Hobby Lobby ruling.\nUdall is in a tight reelection race this November against Rep.
