Though women have picked up Thor\u2019s hammer before, and Wilson is not the first black Captain America, the geek-fueled media storm went nuclear thanks to the prominence of the Avengers, the ever-outraged Internet and announcements on \u201cThe View\u201d and \u201cThe Colbert Report.\u201d\n\nFans of increased diversity in the incredibly influential world of comics have praised the changes. Pinheaded geeks who can\u2019t handle change, even for a couple years (which, let\u2019s be real, is how long these switches typically last) have pitched online hissy-fits. White dudes who feel like they are a persecuted minority have been predictably outraged. Such reactions are common when the pasty white, overly testicular casts of old properties are updated. Remember the hubbub when the reimagined \u201cBattlestar Galactica\u201d turned Starbuck into a woman? While changing the gender or race of a character, much like killing a character, is definitely part publicity stunt, it\u2019s nice to see publicity stunts that also feel like progress while pissing off jerks.\n\nIn comics, there\u2019s a major tradition of new heroes taking up an existing character\u2019s mantle, especially at DC: Jay Garrick, Barry Allen and Wally West have all been the Flash. A metric boatload of guys (and aliens) have been Green Lantern. For most of the past couple of years, villain Dr. Octopus took over the mind of Peter Parker and was Spider-Man. When Batman and Captain America were apparently dead, their former sidekicks Dick Grayson and Bucky Barnes took over.\n\nBut while Captain America and Thor aren\u2019t the only white, male flagship characters to be temporary replaced, they also aren\u2019t the only ones who have changed gender or race. There\u2019s a small but clearly growing tradition in comics of embracing diversity. Here are a few examples of heroes who, over the years, have made the fanciful universes of superheroes look a little more like the world we actually live in.\n\nThe Shield\n\nThis character has nothing to do with the classic FX series. The Shield is an American-themed hero who debuted in 1940 (over a year before Captain America) and features the same star-spangled outfit, a very similar super-soldier origin, and the same type of Nazi-fighting early adventures. In fact, the reason Captain America carries a round shield is that his original triangular shield looked too much like the symbol on The Shield\u2019s chest. In addition to Marvel\u2019s recent switcheroos, Archie\u2019s Dark Circle line announced this week that a new version of the character will be a woman, which is a pretty cool development for one of comics\u2019 most obscure yet influential characters.\n\nSpider-Man\n\nIn 2000, Marvel launched their Ultimate Universe as a place to reinvent their characters, make them more contemporary, and take more chances than in the regular Marvel Universe. The standout comic from the Ultimate line was Brian Michael Bendis and Mark Bagley\u2019s \u201cUltimate Spider-Man,\u201d which created a new Peter Parker who was fresh yet completely in the spirit of Stan Lee and Steve Ditko\u2019s original. When Peter Parker died \u2014 he took a bullet for Captain America \u2014 the death stuck, unlike deaths in the regular universe. Peter was then replaced by Miles Morales, a half black, half Hispanic kid who was also bitten by a radioactive spider. Miles has been Spider-Man ever since in the Ultimate Universe, and let\u2019s hope the brain trust who make the Spider-Man films decide to use him. After the abysmal \u201cSpider-Man 2,\u201d that franchise needs helps fast.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Thor and Captain America aren't the first comic book characters to change up their gender and race", "author": "Mark Peters", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Thor and Captain America aren't the first comic book characters to change up their gender and race", "title": "Superhero switch-ups: A history of race and gender switches in comics", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/07/19/superhero_switch_ups_a_history_of_race_and_gender_switches_in_comics/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/thor_captain_america.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Thor and Captain America aren't the first comic book characters to change up their gender and race", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/thor_captain_america.jpg", "title": "Superhero switch-ups: A history of race and gender switches in comics", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Superhero switch-ups: A history of race and gender switches in comics", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Captain America, Comic Books, Thor", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe612e\"", "article_summary": "But while Captain America and Thor aren\u2019t the only white, male flagship characters to be temporary replaced, they also aren\u2019t the only ones who have changed gender or race.\nWhen Batman and Captain America were apparently dead, their former sidekicks Dick Grayson and Bucky Barnes took over.\nSpider-ManIn 2000, Marvel launched their Ultimate Universe as a place to reinvent their characters, make them more contemporary, and take more chances than in the regular Marvel Universe.\nWhen Peter Parker died \u2014 he took a bullet for Captain America \u2014 the death stuck, unlike deaths in the regular universe.\nMiles has been Spider-Man ever since in the Ultimate Universe, and let\u2019s hope the brain trust who make the Spider-Man films decide to use him."}
