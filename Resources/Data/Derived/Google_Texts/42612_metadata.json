Laughter was absent not only in his personal interactions but as he moved through the Broncos\u2019 locker room.\n\nThere was trouble for the standout linebacker last year, but it wasn\u2019t just that. It was how trouble mushroomed into so many twisted perceptions of Miller the person. He wasn\u2019t the first person to experience this, but he is human. It hurt.\n\nMuch has been made about Miller\u2019s newfound maturity, and while there is ample evidence of this, it\u2019s not the easiest characteristic to measure. Maturity comes in layers. It can begin with the simple task of showing up on time. It can end with teammates trusting that you can be counted on.\n\nIt takes time to establish maturity, more than one calendar year. Everybody tries, but no one can rush time.\n\n\u201cNo, you can\u2019t,\u201d Miller said. \u201cI\u2019ve already talked about all the maturing up. What happened last year helped me become a better person. Would I have liked to have not gone through all that stuff? Yeah. But my mistakes are not going to make me or break me. I\u2019m very lucky. I feel blessed.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an attitude that has helped Miller\u2019s engaging outward appearance to resurface. His skin might be thicker, but it no longer blocks the good-natured humor within. His guard might never again disappear, but it has thinned to where the smile and jokes are once again evident.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re here at the facility, you tell yourself: \u2018I\u2019m not going to let any of that stuff affect me,\u2019 \u201d Miller said. \u201cBut when you go home, you constantly think about stuff. You feel like you constantly have to defend stuff that\u2019s not true. Have to talk about this, have to talk about that. It takes a toll.\n\n\u201cGoing out here this year, the talk is all about football. I can be myself in front of the media and not have to be so angry and worry about how I select my words and who\u2019s going to twist my words. It\u2019s just different this year. It\u2019s different with the media. It\u2019s different with my teammates. I\u2019m looking forward to playing.\u201d\n\nWarm welcome back\n\nFor the first time since tearing his right anterior cruciate ligament Dec. 22, early in the Broncos\u2019 15th game of the 2013 season at Houston, Miller was back playing strongside linebacker in the preseason game Saturday night against those same Texans. The fans at Sports Authority Field at Mile High gave him a warm reception.\n\nThere was a brace on his right knee and he might have to wear it all season, but it has brought no apparent restrictions during training camp. There was explosion, not timidity, in his trademark bend-and-rip pass-rushing technique that helped him average 15 sacks through his first two NFL seasons.\n\nHis conditioning and physique are extraordinary. After serving a six-game suspension for violating the league\u2019s substance-abuse policy last season, Miller returned to play at an overmuscled 268 pounds. He made only five sacks in nine games before his knee buckled.\n\nHe is in the 252-pound range now.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if he\u2019s ever worked this hard in his preparation for a season,\u201d Broncos coach John Fox said. \u201cWhether it\u2019s because of the rehab or what, he\u2019s probably in as good a shape as he\u2019s ever been.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not often a star NFL player comes off a torn ACL and his physical well-being is a secondary concern. Miller doesn\u2019t like it that his past transgressions keep getting brought up, but he understands he has to deal with it a while longer.\n\nWith each sack, each game, each season, each Pro Bowl, maybe even with a Super Bowl ring, forgiveness will come. Broncos fans have always carried an unconditional love for their own.\n\nMiller truly desires to be great and is beginning to understand the responsibility that only the best must carry. First things first. Miller has concentrated on becoming much more responsible.\n\n\u201cHe has embraced it,\u201d said Joby Branion, Miller\u2019s agent. \u201cHe didn\u2019t just put on a show. If he wasn\u2019t genuine about this, you would be hearing about him getting fined for being late to meetings or people upset for him showing up late to appearances. He\u2019s acknowledged that is all part of the decision-making process.\u201d\n\nMaking a choice to listen\n\nLike most young men, Miller went through a spell where he occasionally made decisions without considering the ramifications.\n\nIn the past year, he has kept a close-knit group around him for counsel. Mom, Dad, his agent. He talks with Jerry Butler, the Broncos\u2019 director of player development.\n\nIt\u2019s not about his support team, though. It\u2019s Von. He chooses to listen. He asks the questions. He keeps appointments. He\u2019s early for appointments. He no longer misses flights.\n\nHis supporters don\u2019t make his decisions. He makes the decisions, sometimes after consulting with his group.\n\nFox often says it\u2019s not about the coaches, it\u2019s about the players. Miller was always a coachable player. Talent wasn\u2019t all that was behind his Pro Bowl production in 2011 and 2012.\n\nBut put the skill set of the No. 2 draft pick together with a life in order and add a premier pass rusher in DeMarcus Ware on the other side of the defensive front, and watch out for Von Miller in 2014. Knee brace and all.\n\n\u201cSometimes it takes a minute for young people to see the light,\u201d Fox said. \u201cIt\u2019s a tribute to him and his character that I\u2019ve seen a real big change maturity-wise. Not that he was a little kid. I\u2019m talking about being a pro. In meetings, taking notes. It\u2019s all the little things that help you in your preparation.\u201d\n\nHow this season turns out for Miller, time will tell. It\u2019s already known that he\u2019s off to a much happier start.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Von Miller: \u201cMy mistakes are not going to make or break me\u201d", "title": "Von Miller: \u201cMy mistakes are not going to make or break me\u201d", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/23/von-miller-my-mistakes-are-not-going-to-make-or-break-me/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140823__20140824_C1_SP24FBNMILLERp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140823__20140824_C1_SP24FBNMILLERp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-23T19:57:04+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T11:54:17+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb36a\"", "article_summary": "After serving a six-game suspension for violating the league\u2019s substance-abuse policy last season, Miller returned to play at an overmuscled 268 pounds.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if he\u2019s ever worked this hard in his preparation for a season,\u201d Broncos coach John Fox said.\nVon Miller seems happy, again.\nBut my mistakes are not going to make me or break me.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re here at the facility, you tell yourself: \u2018I\u2019m not going to let any of that stuff affect me,\u2019 \u201d Miller said."}
