This isn\u2019t the case for the \"super-frequent users.\" Although doctors have always suspected that those who use the ED services most frequently suffer from substance abuse, there have never been any proper surveys done on the subject, until now. The study was conducted by Henry Ford Hospital and its findings will be presented at the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine annual meeting in Dallas on May 17, as reported in a recent press release.\n\nIt was revealed that 77 percent of \u201csuper-frequent user\u201d patients had a substance abuse problem. Of these, 47 percent were addicted to pain relief narcotics, 44 percent were addicted to \u201cother\u201d illicit drugs such as cocaine, and 35 percent were addicted to alcohol. Also, super frequent users who are seeking pain-relief narcotics were most commonly women. \"Emergency Departments cannot address the super-frequent users problem without addressing the underlying reason they're here \u2014 their substance abuse problem,\" Jennifer Peltzer, lead author on the study, explained in the release. Peltzer hopes that her study will not only help to address the problem but also motivate a boost in federal and state funding for substance abuse programs.\n\nOne method that has been successful in lowering the number of super-frequents users was the implementation of the Community Resources for Emergency Department Overuse (CREDO). Henry Ford created this program in 2004 in an effort to deal with the large amounts of frequent users in the ED. Since its implementation, the rate of super-frequent users who came seeking pain relief narcotics dropped from 32.5 visits a year to 13.8 visits. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that prescription drug monitoring programs, such as CREDO, can help identify high risk patients who would benefit from an early intervention. \u201cIf Emergency Departments don't have the resources to create a program, instituting narcotic prescribing guidelines may lead to decreased visits by frequent users,\u201d Peltzer advised.\n\nOther options to help lower the high rates of narcotics abusers as recommended by the CDC are: patient review and restriction programs, health care provider accountability, laws to prevent prescription drug abuse and diversion, and better access to abuse treatment.\n\nIn Camden, N.J., hospitals employed a nurse, social worker, and a community hearth worker to closely work together and follow up on top ER users. This program was aimed to help frequent users who were struggling with chronic illnesses along with their addiction and often homelessness problems. The team helped make sure that the patients checked their blood sugar and took their medications. As a result there was a significant reduction in ER visits, along with a huge saving for the hospital, Kaiser Health News reports. \"No one wants to go to the ER. We've demonstrated that if you give people alternatives, they will stop going to the ER,\" founder of the program Dr. Jeffrey C. Brenner told KHN.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "drug abuse, narcotics users, narcotics abuse, emergency rooms and drugs", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Individuals who visit a hospital's ER room more than 10 times a year are likely to be suffering from an addiction problem, according to a new survey.", "title": "Drug Abuse Rampant Among Emergency Room Visitors", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/77-super-frequent-emergency-room-users-abuse-narcotics-283198", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/17/shutterstock153508271.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Individuals who visit a hospital's ER room more than 10 times a year are likely to be suffering from an addiction problem, according to a new survey.", "title": "Drug Abuse Rampant Among Emergency Room Visitors", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/77-super-frequent-emergency-room-users-abuse-narcotics-283198", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/17/shutterstock153508271.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/17/shutterstock153508271.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-05-17T17:13:04-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-05-17T17:13:02-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Individuals who visit a hospital's ER room more than 10 times a year are likely to be suffering from an addiction problem, according to a new survey."}, "article_summary": "It was revealed that 77 percent of \u201csuper-frequent user\u201d patients had a substance abuse problem.\n\"Emergency Departments cannot address the super-frequent users problem without addressing the underlying reason they're here \u2014 their substance abuse problem,\" Jennifer Peltzer, lead author on the study, explained in the release.\nSince its implementation, the rate of super-frequent users who came seeking pain relief narcotics dropped from 32.5 visits a year to 13.8 visits.\nThis isn\u2019t the case for the \"super-frequent users.\"\nAlthough doctors have always suspected that those who use the ED services most frequently suffer from substance abuse, there have never been any proper surveys done on the subject, until now."}
