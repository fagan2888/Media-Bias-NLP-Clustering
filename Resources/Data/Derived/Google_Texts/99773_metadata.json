With approximately 72,000 CNSs practicing nationwide, they represent the second largest number of advanced practice nurses in the United States.\n\nSince the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and publication of the Institute of Medicine\u2019s \u201cThe Future of Nursing\u201d, CNSs and other advanced practice nurses have achieved greater recognition for their contributions to addressing today\u2019s healthcare challenges.\n\nCNSs often lead initiatives to improve patient outcomes, but they also evaluate clinical interventions and processes to ensure best practice standards and patient safety. Their efforts can contribute to decreased lengths of stay, optimized patient safety, improved patient outcomes and cost avoidance. They also mentor staff nurses in evidence-based practice and professional presentation opportunities.\n\nJournal editor Mary Fran Tracy, RN, PhD, CCNS, FAAN, compiled the articles for the issue, which include:\n\n\u2022 Role of the CNS in Improving Patient Outcomes After Cardiac Surgery\n\n\u2022 Using a Scorecard to Demonstrate CNS\u2019 Contributions\n\n\u2022 Role of the CNS in the Journey to Magnet Recognition\n\n\u2022 CNS Regulation: The Maryland Experience\n\n\u201cClinical nurse specialists are uniquely prepared to improve the care of patient populations - whether in acute and critical care settings, the ambulatory/clinic setting or in the transition of patients between settings,\u201d Tracy said. \u201cThis series helps demonstrate their valuable contributions to healthcare leaders, staff and patients.\u201d\n\nAACN Advanced Critical Care is a quarterly, peer-reviewed publication of in-depth articles intended for experienced critical care and acute care clinicians at the bedside, advanced practice nurses, and clinical and academic educators.
