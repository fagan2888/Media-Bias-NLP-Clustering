There have been many and I assume many more to come if the good Lord is willing and the creek doesn\u2019t rise (we say funny things like that down in South Carolina).\n\nBack in December 2013, I was home for the holidays and wrote this blog post on South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley. Some of my conservative friends and family weren\u2019t pleased. Now, none of them disputed a single point I made or even offered to defend her record. I guess they just didn\u2019t like that, as an opinion journalist, I painted a realistic picture of yet another politician saying one thing but doing another. Hypocrisy sends me over the edge. Seriously. I really hate saying one thing and doing another for political convenience or to get re-elected. I also hate people who litter and I really deplore split infinitives. But hypocrisy? It\u2019s the real killer for me.\n\n\n\n[Check out editorial cartoons about Obamacare.]\n\nThere\u2019s a little bit of this hypocrisy going on down in South Carolina. Don\u2019t be shocked by this pronouncement. Let\u2019s look specifically at the issues of poverty, Medicaid and Obamacare. Haley has made it clear she will \u201cnot expand Medicaid. Ever.\u201d Glad she\u2019s emphatic. However, someone should clue the good governor in to the fact that South Carolina Medicaid roles are already expanding thanks to \u201cObamacare\u201d aka the Affordable Care Act. Horrors! Shock! She must be outraged by this travesty!\n\nAccording to South Carolina's Medicaid director, 162,000 more South Carolinians \u2013 many of them children \u2013 will enroll in Medicaid by the end of June 2015 thanks to the fact that the ACA has made them aware that they are eligible. If the state had accepted the Medicaid expansion, an additional 340,000 would have gotten coverage, but thanks to Haley's refusal, they are out of luck.\n\nGroups like the South Carolina Hospital Association strongly support the expansion. They should, since they\u2019re bearing the costs of fly-by health insurance coverage, also known as emergency room care. If you don\u2019t have insurance, you go to the emergency room. Everyone should really just come out of the closet on this one. It\u2019s a crappy way of taking care of the sick and doing business frankly.\n\nSo just yesterday, the Republican Governors Association released this political advertisement against state Sen. Vincent Sheheen, who\u2019s running again against Haley. It accuses Sheheen of supporting Medicaid expansion in South Carolina. Sheheen indeed supports expanding health care to the neediest in our society. That\u2019s not my problem with the RGA ad. My beef with the RGA is that its very own chairman, that would be New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, accepted Medicaid expansion in his state. I applaud him for that. While he may not give a damn about traffic jams in Ft. Lee, he clearly cares about the neediest children in New Jersey, right?\n\nCue the Sheheen campaign, which just released this video this morning, morphing the embattled Christie\u2019s record and image all over a follow-up political advertisement to the Christie RGA ad. To be clear, I support Christie\u2019s expansion of Medicaid in New Jersey. It helps the neediest in that state and it\u2019s the moral thing to do. The question is, does Nikki Haley?\n\n\n\n[See political cartoons about the GOP.]\n\nHer rabid declaration that she\u2019ll never expand Medicaid in South Carolina makes me wonder if she actually gives a damn about anyone in her own state other than her donors? While the RGA was releasing this attack ad on Sheheen, Haley was next door in Georgia again raising money for her re-elect. I don\u2019t begrudge her ability to raise money but I do have a problem with her politicization of that fundraiser at the expense of South Carolina\u2019s ports and people.\n\nAnd so this is my problem with Nikki Haley: I don\u2019t think she actually has a clue about the impacts her decisions have on her own constituents. She stands by Chris Christie while my home state of South Carolina has a poverty rate of nearly 20 percent and a child poverty rate of nearly 30 percent. In her State of the State address a short time ago, Haley proposed tax cuts while doing nothing to address the biggest problems in the state: health care costs and poverty. It\u2019s time for Haley to visit the poorest of the poorest in South Carolina. She should go to Timmonsville or maybe Allendale where nearly 70 percent of that town\u2019s residents are below the poverty level. Or maybe she should visit Marion County where my family has lived since the 1700s. Bottom line: She doesn\u2019t have a clue who\u2019s hurting and who\u2019s thriving in the state where she\u2019s the chief executive officer.\n\nI\u2019m reminded of that line from Oliver Twist that sums this all up so well: \u201cThere are people in the world so hungry, that God cannot appear to them except in the form of bread.\u201d If she keeps this up, Nikki Haley might well go down as the modern day Mr. Bumble of South Carolina, a reference to the Dickens character of whom Oliver Twist asks \u201cPlease, sir, I want some more.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "title": "South Carolina Gov.
