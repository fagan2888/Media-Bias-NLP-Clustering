(The Spanish word for \u201cObamacare\u201d is \u201cObamacare.\u201d)\n\nA few blocks later, she stopped to ask for directions from a man smoking a cigarette, then asked if he had health care coverage. He did.\n\n\u201cYou know, we all gotta get insurance \u2019cause they\u2019ll fine you,\u201d the man told her.\n\nAs the second enrollment period under Obamacare winds down \u2013 Sunday is the last day to sign up for private insurance this year \u2013 Persia and others are gearing up for a final push.\n\nAccess Health CT, the state\u2019s health insurance exchange, has been mailing information to 200,000 state residents deemed like to be uninsured and calling many in Hartford \u2013 the city with the highest rate of uninsured residents, according to the exchange's research.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to really pull out all the stops,\u201d said Jason Madrak, Access Health\u2019s chief marketing officer.\n\nMany people expected this year\u2019s three-month enrollment period to be more challenging than last year\u2019s six-month sign-up blitz, which included enrollment fairs across the state, widespread publicity about the health law\u2019s rollout and millions of dollars in federal funds that helped pay more than 200 people from community organizations to conduct outreach.\n\nThis enrollment period came with the added complication of trying to renew existing customers while appealing to those who were still uninsured \u2013 and with no federal dollars for outreach.\n\nWhile Persia and others trying to reach the uninsured say it\u2019s been tougher, others, including Fairfield insurance broker Tim Tracy Jr., said this enrollment period has been smoother than the previous one.\n\n\u201cObviously, there\u2019s still hurdles, but we\u2019re only in year two,\u201d said Tracy, president of the Connecticut Chapter of the National Association of Health Underwriters.\n\nSign up numbers\n\nAccess Health\u2019s goals for this enrollment period include signing up 110,000 private insurance customers and reducing the number of uninsured by 35,000 \u2013 a quarter of the 140,000 people Access Health officials believe still don't have coverage.\n\nArielle Levin Becker / The CT Mirror\n\nAs of Jan. 30, 95,700 people had signed up for private insurance through Access Health, including about 66,700 repeat customers from 2014. (On Monday, officials said more than 99,000 people had signed up for private insurance plans through the exchange.) By comparison, last year, slightly more than 80,000 people bought insurance through the exchange (though a few thousand dropped out as the year went on).\n\nSince the first Obamacare sign-up period began in October 2013, the number of Connecticut residents enrolled in Medicaid has grown by more than 127,000. Madrak said total membership \u2013 private insurance and Medicaid \u2013 is approaching 500,000, although that figure includes many people who already had Medicaid and used the exchange to renew their coverage.\n\nSome of Access Health's new insurance customers are likely to be people who had insurance last year but needed to find new policies for 2015 because their old plans didn't meet the health law's requirements and were discontinued. More than 60,000 Connecticut residents were in that position, but it's not clear how many bought new coverage through the exchange.\n\nTracy, the Fairfield broker, said about 95 percent of his clients who needed to buy new policies picked plans sold outside the exchange, where he said there are more plan options and wider choices in provider networks. The exceptions, he said, are those who qualify for federal subsidies to discount their coverage, which is only available to people who buy plans through the exchange.\n\nReaching the uninsured\n\nWith fewer uninsured to reach and less money to spend, Access Health officials took a different approach to enrollment efforts this year, offering help during set hours at fixed locations, including storefronts in New Britain and New Haven, libraries and state Department of Labor offices. As of mid-January, 4,843 people signed up for coverage at those locations, Madrak said.\n\nArielle Levin Becker / The CT Mirror\n\nPeople involved in last year's campaign worried the exchange's strategy this time wouldn\u2019t be enough to reach those who remained uninsured. In response, the Connecticut Health Foundation, Hartford Foundation for Public Giving and The Foundation for Community Health provided money for about 35 people \u2013 those most effective at signing people up last time \u2013 to conduct \u201cshoe leather\u201d outreach to find and help the uninsured.\n\nPersia is one of them. She works for the National Alliance on Mental Illness, Connecticut, and has spent much of the sign-up period visiting libraries, job training programs and churches. She signed up 10 people at an Olive Garden.\n\nVisits to tax clinics have been fruitful for finding people interested in signing up, since people without coverage \u2013 or a valid excuse \u2013 must pay a penalty when they file their taxes.\n\nAs of Friday, Persia had signed up 97 people and hoped to reach 150 by the Feb. 15 deadline.\n\nShe spent part of the day walking through Hartford, dropping off flyers. At El Kasique Mini Mart, she chatted with Brito, the man working behind the counter, who was uninsured until signing up for insurance last year.\n\nHe's been frustrated at the difficulty of getting questions answered in Spanish by his insurance company. Even things like how much he\u2019ll have to pay if he goes to the hospital or what the plan covers have been hard to find out by phone, he said.\n\nCompared to last year, this sign-up period has been more challenging, with fewer people showing up eager to get coverage, said Natasha Harris, youth program manager for the Urban League of Greater Hartford, another organization that received foundation funding to do outreach.\n\n\"We've been distributing flyers like crazy,\" she said.\n\nShe\u2019s signed up community college students and parents at Hartford Public High School, and visited churches to talk about health care coverage.\n\nHarris said she\u2019s seen more young people interested in signing up after being uninsured last year.\n\n\u201cA lot of them say, \u2018I never get sick so I really didn\u2019t see the point of having it, but if I\u2019m going to get fined, then I\u2019d rather have it and cover myself than pay for something that I\u2019m not going to get anything out of,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nBut Harris said others are probably opting for the penalty, which costs less than insurance.\n\n\u201cI just wish more people would enroll,\u201d she said. \u201cI know the need is there.\u201d\n\nSome people have called her for help navigating the Access Health website.\n\nAnd one man she helped last year called to say that after getting coverage, he learned he had cancer. He told Harris he wouldn't have been insured if the health law hadn\u2019t passed, and if she hadn\u2019t been around to help him sign up.\n\n\u201cHe just called to thank me,\u201d she said.\n\nFor more information about health insurance and Obamacare, visit The Mirror\u2019s guide to health care in Connecticut.", "article_metadata": {"standout": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/02/09/as-obamacare-sign-up-period-winds-down-a-final-push-for-the-uninsured/", "news_keywords": "Health Care, Access Health CT, Affordable Care Act, exchange, insurance, Obamacare, uninsured", "original-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/02/09/as-obamacare-sign-up-period-winds-down-a-final-push-for-the-uninsured/", "og": {"site_name": "The CT Mirror", "description": "Sunday is the last day to buy private health insurance this year, and those trying to reach the uninsured are making calls, sending mail and visiting libraries, grocery stores, tax clinics, churches, big-box stores and bus stops in a final enrollment push.", "title": "As Obamacare sign-up period winds down, a final push for the uninsured", "url": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/02/09/as-obamacare-sign-up-period-winds-down-a-final-push-for-the-uninsured/", "image": "http://ctmirror.org/files/2015/02/DSCN5667-1170x878.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ctmirror", "card": "summary", "creator": "@ariellelb"}, "syndication-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/02/09/as-obamacare-sign-up-period-winds-down-a-final-push-for-the-uninsured/", "fb": {"admins": "10103384569292809,7920421,10205310995067193", "app_id": 439136839547306}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9d54\"", "article_summary": "As the second enrollment period under Obamacare winds down \u2013 Sunday is the last day to sign up for private insurance this year \u2013 Persia and others are gearing up for a final push.\nFor more information about health insurance and Obamacare, visit The Mirror\u2019s guide to health care in Connecticut.\n\u201cI know the need is there.\u201dSome people have called her for help navigating the Access Health website.\nThis enrollment period came with the added complication of trying to renew existing customers while appealing to those who were still uninsured \u2013 and with no federal dollars for outreach.\nSince the first Obamacare sign-up period began in October 2013, the number of Connecticut residents enrolled in Medicaid has grown by more than 127,000."}
