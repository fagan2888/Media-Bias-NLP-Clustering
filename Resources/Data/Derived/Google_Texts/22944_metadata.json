Andrew Bayne\u2019s grave. One century after the start of World War I, the family found closure in homage to a forebear who had traveled half the world to meet his death, his stomach ripped open by an exploding shell, in the horrors of Flanders Fields.\n\nBayne left his wife, Katie, with four young children in Brisbane and a prescient letter of regret: \u201cWhat a dammed fool I was to ever have enlisted.\u201d\n\nBayne lies alongside other Commonwealth victims and a handful of German dead, the rows of pristine white tombstones stretching over rich, undulating pastures. Belgium and France are still scarred by more than 1,000 graveyards, countless bomb craters, rusting gas shells, bunkers and trenches that tore apart the Western Front for four years.\n\nThe front line of death and destruction burned through the Alps, Central Europe and beyond. It claimed 14 million lives \u2014 5 million civilians and 9 million soldiers, sailors and airmen from 28 countries. The 1914-18 conflict was so unprecedented in its scope and savagery that it became known simply as \u201cThe Great War.\u201d At least 7 million troops were left permanently disabled, and families across the globe, much like Bayne\u2019s, were wrecked.\n\nDespite the vows of \u201cnever again\u201d across a shell-shocked world, the outcome of the conflict only sowed the bitter seeds that led to World War II and more slaughter. And the nationalist tensions that set off the killing never really died, most recently resurfacing in Ukraine and Russia.\n\nFor Kaylene Biggs, misty-eyed after finally facing the grave of her great-grandfather, the war\u2019s far-reaching legacy makes remembrance all the more important. \u201cIt isn\u2019t until you do visit the battlefields that you realize the huge amount of loss and sacrifice.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, it seems so peaceful,\u201d she said amid the twitter of birds and the faraway galloping of a horse.\n\nThe early summer of 1914 seemed just as tranquil to most Europeans. By that time, the Bayne family had already been in Australia for two years, hoping to build a richer life after toiling for meager rewards on a Scottish farm.\n\nLittle did they know that Europe wouldn\u2019t let them go so easily.\n\nBoth sides had initially expected a quick war, but it soon became a deadly stalemate the likes of which had never been seen. Sometimes tens of thousands would die in a single day. Artillery was relentless. Toxic gas was introduced in modern warfare with devastating effect. Because of it, the need for fresh manpower was enormous \u2014 and the reach of the British Empire was global.\n\nIt was only a matter of time for the war to turn up at Andrew Bayne\u2019s doorstep in Brisbane.\n\nFamily archives showed Bayne fought at Bullecourt in northern France, where two battles cost Australia 10,000 casualties and hardly moved the front line.\n\nBayne, like so many millions of soldiers, long remained hopeful as the war stretched into its fourth year. The Germans, he wrote home, \u201care about starved out and they can\u2019t last much longer.\u201d He added, \u201cCheer up. I will be with you yet.\u201d\n\nOn Aug. 19, 1917, a German shell burst close to him as he was on the Ypres front holding the line close to Messines Ridge, little more than a molehill but a killer of thousands on both sides. The pain and agony were recorded matter-of-factly in a witness report: \u201cThe wounds were left arm, right of face and stomach \u2014 the latter a bad one.\u201d\n\nBayne could still call for a stretcher and, before losing consciousness, utter: \u201cThey have got me.\u201d\n\nHe died soon afterward. He was 32.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "One soldiers story reveals tragedy of World War I", "title": "One soldiers story reveals tragedy of World War I", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/06/14/one-soldiers-story-reveals-tragedy-of-world-war-i/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140614__20140615_A15_ND15WWI1p2.jpg", "height": 444}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140614__20140615_A15_ND15WWI1p2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-14T19:02:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T08:19:58+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9663\"", "article_summary": "It claimed 14 million lives \u2014 5 million civilians and 9 million soldiers, sailors and airmen from 28 countries.\nDespite the vows of \u201cnever again\u201d across a shell-shocked world, the outcome of the conflict only sowed the bitter seeds that led to World War II and more slaughter.\nBayne, like so many millions of soldiers, long remained hopeful as the war stretched into its fourth year.\nIt was only a matter of time for the war to turn up at Andrew Bayne\u2019s doorstep in Brisbane.\nBoth sides had initially expected a quick war, but it soon became a deadly stalemate the likes of which had never been seen."}
