DENVER -- Congressman Ed Perlmutter, D-Golden, has successfully staved off a number of Republican challengers in recent years in what was supposed to be the state's quintessential swing district.

This year, he faces a challenge from Republican Don Ytterberg.

In a debate on #COpolitics: From The Source, Perlmutter defended his record including his support for the Affordable Care Act, which Ytterberg said he'd have voted with House Republicans to repeal.

The two also sparred over immigration reform, climate change and national security issues.
