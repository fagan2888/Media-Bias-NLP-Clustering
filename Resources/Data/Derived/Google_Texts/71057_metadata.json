(AP) - Sonya Pierce arrived at the Salem Hospital emergency department at 9:30 p.m. recently, with severe stomach pains. She says she was cramping and couldn\u2019t stand or walk.\n\nWhen she was finally seen at 6 a.m. the next day, she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer.\n\n\u201cI felt like I\u2019d been abused as a human being there,\u201d she said.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just that Pierce, 51, had to wait more than eight hours in pain to learn of her cancer diagnosis. She also felt she was mistreated by the triage nurses, who told her she was \u201clow priority.\u201d\n\nPierce doesn\u2019t believe her lack of insurance at the time helped her situation either.\n\n\u201cThey actually saw everybody in the ER room before they saw me that day,\u201d Pierce said. \u201cThey act like it\u2019s a normal situation.\u201d\n\nPierce\u2019s story is one example of how an overloaded hospital can affect an individual\u2019s experience in the emergency room. Long waits aren\u2019t only inefficient, it can feel inhumane to patients who are in crisis.\n\nAdministrators have said Salem Hospital has been experiencing high volumes since the winter of 2012. They recently opened a nine-bed transitional care unit to hold patients who are waiting for inpatient beds to free up, a common way hospitals deal with stress in the emergency room.\n\nChief operating officer Cheryl Nester Wolfe said emergency department staff use a prioritization system so the most acute patients are seen first. Abdominal pain falls in Level 3 of the five-level system, behind patients with symptoms of stroke, heart attack and trauma.\n\nWhile the hospital declined to comment on Pierce\u2019s specific situation, citing patient privacy laws, Wolfe said lots of factors can lead to long waits. For one, between noon and midnight is the busiest time for the emergency room.\n\nDuring the month of August, 32 percent of all emergency patients arrived at the hospital between 6 p.m. and midnight.\n\nBut the hospital does have written expectations on how patients waiting in the lobby should be treated. It includes taking vitals every two hours for Level 3 patients and at least once for Levels 4 and 5 (minor conditions), according to a standard work procedure document provided by the hospital. Nurses are also to check on the patients every hour, update them and apologize for the wait and provide blankets, water and coffee.\n\nPierce said her vitals were checked only once, 35 minutes after her arrival. And she doesn\u2019t believe nurses were courteous or compassionate to her when she asked for updates.\n\nDr. Howard Mell, a Cleveland-based emergency physician and spokesman for American College of Emergency Physicians, said emergency room volume has been growing nationwide, and it has been attributed to the expanded availability of health care coverage through the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBut it\u2019s not because people are misusing the emergency room, Mell said. Rather, the patients\u2019 lack of primary care leads to a legitimate emergency.\n\n\u201cIf they could\u2019ve been seen three days ago for asthma medication, they wouldn\u2019t be at the ED with an asthma attack,\u201d he said.\n\nOnly about 8 percent of emergency room patients have needs that are not considered urgent, Mell said.\n\nAt Salem Hospital, however, an average of 23 percent of the patients coming to the emergency room in August had minor and non-life threatening conditions. These patients are categorized in Level 4 and 5 and have symptoms like sprains, urinary tract infections, sore throats, cold symptoms and rashes. Urgent care or doctor\u2019s offices could be a cheaper and more efficient option for many of them.\n\nThe hospital operates a \u201cfast-track\u201d system for this group to move them along quicker, but only from 3 to 11 p.m. every day.\n\nAbdominal pain falls in Level 3, along with stable asthma, complex lacerations and stable extremity fractures. So it\u2019s possible the hospital was seeing a lot of acute patients while Pierce was seeking care.\n\nMell said that in addition to more people having insurance, hospitals are seeing sicker patients with more complex conditions. And triage nurses have to think in terms of \u201cwhat\u2019s going to kill this person in the next five minutes,\u201d he said.\n\nOften, even when doctors and nurses are providing the best possible care, a patient\u2019s experience might be the opposite, Mell said, especially when they receive a life-altering diagnosis.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to manage the patient\u2019s perception when they\u2019re having the worst day of their life,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Statesman Journal, http://www.statesmanjournal.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sonya Pierce arrived at the Salem Hospital emergency department at 9:30 p.m. recently, with severe stomach pains.
