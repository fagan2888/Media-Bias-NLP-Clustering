Instead, once again, you bypassed the will of the people, as reflected in their elected officials, and simply made a decision affecting millions of Americans.\n\nWorse still, you ignored the appeals of trusted religious leaders, some of whom campaigned for you in the past and others of whom have been among your trusted advisors, deciding instead to side with radical LGBT activism.\n\nThese leaders made a righteous and reasonable appeal to you, writing, \u201cMr. President, you have spoken eloquently of your commitment to protecting religious liberty, our nation\u2019s first freedom. As you seek to promote the rights of LGBT persons, please also protect the rights of faith-based organizations that simply desire to utilize staffing practices consistent with their deep religious convictions as they partner with the federal government via contracting or subcontracting.\u201d\n\nIn response, you mocked these \u201cdeep religious convictions,\u201d and there are no words you can say to minimize the seriousness of your actions.\n\nMr. President, what was wrong with letting Congress make an informed decision on ENDA? Do you scorn the political process so much that you bypass it entirely?\n\nYou stated that, \u201cI\u2019m going to do what I can, with the authority I have, to act,\u201d but the implications of your actions are massive.\n\nAn organization like Prison Reform, which utilizes federal funds to help transform the lives of inmates, would suffer dramatic financial setbacks should they simply refuse to hire individuals who violate their time-proven, biblically-based code of conduct.\n\nChildren supported by World Vision, with the help of federal funds, would be deprived of food and shelter unless World Vision leaders compromised their Christian convictions. (After much soul searching this year, they have made clear that they will not compromise).\n\nFine Christian universities, which provide important academic and ethical training for the next generation of leaders and which are also the recipients of federal funding, could suffer a massive blow unless they forsake the faith on which their institutions were built.\n\nMr. President, must you now even take the place of God and tell Christians what they can and cannot actively practice?\n\nI concur with Peter Sprigg who wrote that, \u201cThis level of coercion is nothing less than viewpoint blackmail that bullies into silence every contractor and subcontractor who has moral objections to homosexual behavior. This order gives activists a license to challenge their employers and, expose those employers to threats of costly legal proceedings and the potential of jeopardizing future contracts.\u201d\n\nIn truth, this is not a Civil Rights issue, as if gay were the new black. As Catholic leader Austin Ruse observed, \u201cthe LGBTs are the most powerful aggrieved minority the world has ever known,\u201d while, in contrast, \u201cBlack Americans really were aggrieved: enslaved, not allowed to vote, discriminated against in housing, banking, and much else, hunted down and lynched.\u201d\n\nAs our nation\u2019s first African American president, you must surely see the difference. Or is it true, as your critics claim, that you really intend to declare war on religion in America?\n\nIt is one thing to treat all people fairly, be they male or female, gay or straight, young or old. It is another thing to trample religious freedoms under foot and to attempt to coerce, with the full force of the government, men and women of deep religious faith and commitment.\n\nMr. President, there are millions of Americans who pray for you on a regular basis, and I have often called on my radio listeners to pray that you would be the greatest president in American history.\n\nDespite those prayers, you took it upon yourself to enact an order which declares that, in the workplace, sexual rights trump religious rights. What a terrible, tragic shame.\n\nI do pray for you, sir, as my president, that God would grant you the humility to recognize the error of your ways. At the same time, I assure you that there are countless thousands of Christian leaders and people of faith who will neither abandon their convictions nor be silenced from articulating those convictions.\n\nAnd so, perhaps, in God\u2019s providence, what you intended as a religious restriction will become the impetus for a religious awakening.\n\nAfter all, you might well be the most powerful human being on the planet, but we will all bow down one day before the throne of God, and He will have the final say.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Dear Mr. President, I write to you today as a concerned citizen of our great nation, standing as a witness against your historic actions on the morning of July 21, 2014, actions which I hope you will one day repudiate with deep remorse and regret..05/26/2016 18:39:09PM EST.", "author": "Michael Brown", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Dear Mr. President, I write to you today as a concerned citizen of our great nation, standing as a witness against your historic actions on the morning of July 21, 2014, actions which I hope you will one day repudiate with deep remorse and regret.", "title": "Michael Brown - President Obama You Have Crossed A Dangerous, Unprecedented Line", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/michaelbrown/2014/07/22/president-obama-you-have-crossed-a-dangerous-unprecedented-line-n1864587", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/202/325eb086-8f2b-45cd-b700-7a61d576abf9.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Dear Mr. President, I write to you today as a concerned citizen of our great nation, standing as a witness against your historic actions on the morning of July 21, 2014, actions which I hope you will one day repudiate with deep remorse and regret.", "title": "Michael Brown - President Obama You Have Crossed A Dangerous, Unprecedented Line", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/michaelbrown/2014/07/22/president-obama-you-have-crossed-a-dangerous-unprecedented-line-n1864587", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/202/325eb086-8f2b-45cd-b700-7a61d576abf9.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "President Obama You Have Crossed A Dangerous, Unprecedented Line, Michael Brown, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "Despite those prayers, you took it upon yourself to enact an order which declares that, in the workplace, sexual rights trump religious rights.\nIt is another thing to trample religious freedoms under foot and to attempt to coerce, with the full force of the government, men and women of deep religious faith and commitment.\nMr. President, must you now even take the place of God and tell Christians what they can and cannot actively practice?\nI do pray for you, sir, as my president, that God would grant you the humility to recognize the error of your ways.\nPresident, you have spoken eloquently of your commitment to protecting religious liberty, our nation\u2019s first freedom."}
