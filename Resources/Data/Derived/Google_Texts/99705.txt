LOS ANGELES (AP) — “Inside Out,” the Pixar animated feature that brings to life the inner emotions of an 11-year-old girl, won the Oscar for best animated feature on Sunday.

The win represented the second directing Oscar for 47-year-old Pete Docter, who also won for “Up” in 2009, and was a 16th Oscar win for Pixar. It is the storied Disney-owned studio’s eighth animated feature Oscar win since the category was created in 2002.

“This film is really born from watching our kids grow up, which is not easy,” Docter told the Oscars audience.

“Inside Out,” available to stream to Starz subscribers in the U.S., has been a critical and commercial success, having garnered $777 million at the worldwide box office, not including digital and disc sales.

The film tracks the adventures of five key emotions inside Riley’s mind — Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust and Anger — as they struggle to help her.

Docter has said the main character, Riley, who is uprooted from her Minnesota home to move with her parents to San Francisco, was inspired by his own daughter, Elie.
