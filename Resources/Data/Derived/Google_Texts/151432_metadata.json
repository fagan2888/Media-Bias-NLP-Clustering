He became only the second Polish rider to win a Tour stage, after Zenon Jaskula in 1993. \u201cI am a little tired, but \u2026 I had a calm first week to help Alberto. It broke my heart to see him leave.\u201d\n\nTeam owner Oleg Tinkov, a Russian businessman, choked up, wiped his nose, and put on sunglasses.\n\n\u201cWe lost Alberto, we had to win,\u201d he said through a translator on French TV. \u201cRafal is a marvelous young rider. We will come back to try to win the Tour one day.\u201d\n\nMajka said he did not believe speculation that Tinkoff-Saxo Bank selected him among its nine Tour riders only after the team suspended Czech rider Roman Kreuziger. Just days before announcing its Tour roster last month, the team suspended Kreuziger from competing any more this year because of anomalies in his biological passport, which cycling officials use to fight doping. He has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nMajka, who said he was tired after the strong Giro performance, said he was given assurances by team managers that \u201cyou\u2019ll do the Tour, but you\u2019ll take it easy in the first week,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s also wrong to think that I\u2019m doing the Tour because Roman Kreuziger isn\u2019t. Had he been able to start, we would have both been part of the team.\u201d\n\nVictor Petri, a team spokesman, confirmed Majka was in contention for a roster spot before the Kreuziger case.\n\nThe Pole was out front early in the stage, joining a 17-rider breakaway behind Spain\u2019s Joaquim Rodriguez, the Tour\u2019s best climber. They cleared the first big climb, the Lauteret pass, with about a five-minute lead. By the top of the Izoard, they had thinned to 10. As the groupetto splintered on the last climb, and Nibali and the peloton closed in, Majka covered the last eight kilometers alone.\n\nThe stage didn\u2019t shake up the top five standings, but the day\u2019s biggest loser was Alejandro Valverde of Spain: The Movistar team leader held on to his second place but lost a minute to Nibali and saw his gap over third-place Romain Bardet of France slip to 13 seconds. Overall, Nibali leads Valverde by 4:37 and Bardet by 4:50. American Tejay van Garderen was fifth, 5:49 back.\n\nNibali\u2019s strong performance makes the Tour from here to the finish in eight days in Paris looking more and more like a race for podium spots below him.\n\nGiuseppe Martinelli, a manager with Nibali\u2019s Astana team and an Italian cycling veteran, said Nibali\u2019s \u201cbig engine\u201d was making the difference: \u201cIt\u2019s what makes the difference between a very strong rider and a regular rider.\u201d\n\n\u201cPreparation, team strategy, that\u2019s all good. But it\u2019s the engine that makes the difference in times like this,\u201d Martinelli added.\n\nNibai crossed 24 seconds behind Majka, followed by Jean-Christophe Peraud in third, two seconds slower. Bardet and fellow French rider Thibaut Pinot conducted a two-man sprint and crossed another 24 seconds back. Van Garderen was fifth, 54 seconds behind.\n\n\u201cFrom the team car, I was told: \u2018If you still have something in the tank, go for it,'\u201d Nibali said. \u201cI was looking at gaining some time over Alejandro Valverde. I heard that he cracked after I left him.\u201d\n\nValverde, speaking from a team car, said \u201cI didn\u2019t crack!\u201d and explained that his trouble stemmed mainly from bad coordination with Pinot on the final climb and taking leadership of their bunch. As for the overall title chase, Valverde said: \u201cNibali is the strongest, but we others are neck and neck.\u201d\n\nNibali addressed speculation that he might have known Michele Ferrari, an Italian doctor who was banned by the Italian Cycling Federation in 2002 and by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency two years ago for serving as a doping consultant on Lance Armstrong\u2019s winning teams.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never met him personally. I\u2019ve been accused in the past to have worked with him,\u201d said Nibali, referring to allegations that there were photographs of him together with Ferrari. \u201cThose pictures simply didn\u2019t exist.\u201d\n\nSunday\u2019s stage offers some relief after the Alps: Stage 15 is a flat 222 kilometers (138 miles) from Tallard to Nimes, before riders take the second rest day.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Rafal Majka earns Pole position on Tour\u2019s 14th stage", "title": "Rafal Majka earns Pole position on Tour\u2019s 14th stage", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/07/19/rafal-majka-earns-pole-position-on-tours-14th-stage/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140719__Rafal-Majkap1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140719__Rafal-Majkap1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-19T19:46:37+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T05:49:12+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "He became only the second Polish rider to win a Tour stage, after Zenon Jaskula in 1993.\nThe Pole was out front early in the stage, joining a 17-rider breakaway behind Spain\u2019s Joaquim Rodriguez, the Tour\u2019s best climber.\nNibai crossed 24 seconds behind Majka, followed by Jean-Christophe Peraud in third, two seconds slower.\nAs the groupetto splintered on the last climb, and Nibali and the peloton closed in, Majka covered the last eight kilometers alone.\nMajka\u2019s victory was the first on this Tour by his Tinkoff-Saxo Bank team, which lost main leader Alberto Contador when he crashed out injured on Stage 10."}
