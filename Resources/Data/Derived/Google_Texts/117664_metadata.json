Breitbart Texas has learned that many of the planes being used to transport the foreigners are large charter passenger jets; the cost of each one-way, relatively short plane trip typically costs about $100,000. A longer flight can cost much more. The government has flown numerous such air crafts, filled with illegal immigrants, during recent months.\n\nPhotos on ABC10, initially noticed by Peter Maxwell, show illegal immigrants unloading out of planes owned by Ameristar Jet Charters; the air crafts transported hundreds of unaccompanied minors and family units from McAllen, Texas to San Diego, California in early July. Other photos from ABC10 show more migrants being transported on charter planes owned by XTRA Airways.\n\nBreitbart Texas reached out to both companies for pricing information. A sales representative from Ameristar Jet said that the price of a one-way charter flight includes fuel, crew, and basic catering costs. Stacy Muth of Ameristar Jet told Breitbart Texas that the cost of a one-way commercial charter plane for 150 passengers typically costs about $100,000.\n\nSimilarly, a salesman from XTRA Airways told Breitbart Texas that a one-way flight of the same passenger capacity into San Diego from South Texas would cost around $85,000. More than 100 illegal immigrants were transported were flown to San Diego on an XTRA plane in July, according to ABC10.\n\nAlthough using taxpayer money, the federal government refuses to disclose how much is being shelled out for each plane used to carry the migrants; but assuming Department of Homeland Security paid the standard price for each one-way plane from South Texas to San Diego, hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars have been spent transporting the illegal immigrants to California alone. Flights to destinations further away likely have an even higher price tag.\n\nPhone calls from Breitbart Texas to the Department of Homeland Security, inquiring about the cost of each flight, were not immediately returned.\n\nAt this point migrants have been or will likely be transported via taxpayer-subsidized aircraft from McAllen to numerous cities around the country including those in Texas, California, Arizona, Oklahoma, Michigan, Massachusetts, and Maryland.\n\nMany U.S. citizens have expressed outrage over the fact that illegal immigrants from Central America are not being turned away at the border\u2013instead, they are being sent to facilities around the nation where they enjoy a slew of taxpayer-funded amenities such as housing, food, education, vocational training, recreation, and even legal counsel. After spending a relatively short amount of time in such a shelter, most of the illegal immigrants are then released onto U.S. soil, promising authorities that they will show up in court at a later date for an immigration hearing.\n\nBut according to Victor Manjarrez\u2013a professor at the University of Texas El Paso, former Chief Patrol Agent of Tucson Sector, and former Chief Patrol Agent in El Paso Sector\u2013most of the migrants never appear for their court hearing. They eventually end up being forgotten about by authorities or get \u201clost in the woodwork.\u201d\n\nThe steep costs associated with the border crisis are quickly draining federal resources. As Breitbart Texas previously reported, President Obama requested $3.7 billion to deal with the situation. Most of the proposed funds, however, would go to Health and Human Services (HHS)\u2013the agency responsible for caring for the migrants and reuniting them with family members. Only $433 million would go to Customs and Border Protection, which is in charge of securing the border.\n\nFollow Kristin Tate on Twitter @KristinBTate.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Feds Likely Spending Millions on Charter Jets to Transport Migrants to US Cities", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Feds Likely Spending Millions on Charter Jets to Transport Migrants to US Cities", "title": "Feds Likely Spending Millions on Charter Jets to Transport Migrants to US Cities - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Breitbart-Texas/2014/07/19/Plane-Sunset-PA.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/texas/2014/07/20/feds-likely-spending-millions-on-charter-jets-to-transport-migrants-to-us-cities/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Feds Likely Spending Millions on Charter Jets to Transport Migrants to US Cities", "title": "Feds Likely Spending Millions on Charter Jets to Transport Migrants to US Cities - Breitbart", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Breitbart-Texas/2014/07/19/Plane-Sunset-PA.jpg", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Homeland Security, Illegal Immigrants, Twitter,Breitbart Texas,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Breitbart Texas", "tag": "Twitter", "published_time": "2014-07-20T07:35:00-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart Texas"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2103\"", "article_summary": "The government has flown numerous such air crafts, filled with illegal immigrants, during recent months.\nAs Breitbart Texas previously reported, President Obama requested $3.7 billion to deal with the situation.\nBreitbart Texas reached out to both companies for pricing information.\nPhone calls from Breitbart Texas to the Department of Homeland Security, inquiring about the cost of each flight, were not immediately returned.\nOther photos from ABC10 show more migrants being transported on charter planes owned by XTRA Airways."}
