Man charged with murder of woman found asphyxiated in NW Side home

A man has been charged with the murder of a woman found dead in her home in the Northwest Side Montclare neighborhood Wednesday after an autopsy showed she died from asphyxiation.

Sandra Fellows was found dead in her home in the 6600 block of West Belden about 2:30 p.m. Wednesday, according to police and the Cook County medical examiner’s office.

Robert Hill, 33, of the 1400 block of South Hamlin, was charged Thursday with first-degree murder, a statement from Chicago Police said.

Hill was arrested after police officers discovered the 56-year-old woman dead in her home after responding to a call there.

Hill was identified as a suspect and arrested, though police would not provide further details.

An autopsy found Fellows died of asphyxiation and ruled her death a homicide, according to the medical examiner’s office.

Hill is scheduled to appear in bond court Friday.
