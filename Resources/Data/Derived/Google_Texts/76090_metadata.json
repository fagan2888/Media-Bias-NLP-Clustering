Debt forgiven after 20 years.\n\n\u2022 Refinancing at current rates for recent graduates.\n\n\u2022 Free tuition at community colleges. Student aid money could be used for educational \u201cboot camps\u201d and online courses that teach job skills.\n\nThe full plan is here.\n\nAccording to the plan, about a third of the overall cost would go toward reducing the interest rate on new or existing student loans \u2014 whether for public or private education \u2014 which currently bring the Department of Education billions of dollars in profits.\n\nRepublicans tend to take an approach to higher education overhaul that does not expand the size and scope of the federal government, instead arguing for colleges and universities to reduce their operating costs. \u201cHer argument basically is, \u2018Let\u2019s just raise taxes and pour more money into the same system,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Rubio said in an interview. \u201cMy argument is: We need a brand-new system.\u201d\n\nSince 2004, tuition and fees for in-state residents at public colleges nationwide have increased 40 percent, adjusted for inflation. State higher education spending per student, adjusted for inflation, dropped 20 percent since 2008 \u2014 tipping the balance so that students now pay a greater share of the costs than the states. In bad times, states often use their higher education funds as the balance wheel to keep their budget in order. Some governors, like Scott Walker of Wisconsin, a Republican presidential candidate, have found higher education spending cuts an alternative to trims from Medicaid or the prison system.\n\nTo balance their books, most flagship state universities are admitting more out-of-state and international students, who pay much higher tuition.\n\nThough states would be eager for added federal funding, George Pernsteiner, president of the State Higher Education Executive Officers Association, said, they are likely to be wary of giving up their education budget flexibility unless there was a safety valve allowing education reductions in tough economic times.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOne fundamental question about Mrs. Clinton\u2019s plan \u2014 already raised by several Republicans \u2014 is whether it would help cut college costs. A July report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York concluded that more federal loan money did indeed contribute to higher prices. But last year, a Congressional Research Service report reached the opposite conclusion. And previous studies have gone both ways.\n\n\u201cTo prove that X causes Y, you need research that consistently produces the same results, and we haven\u2019t had that,\u201d said Terry W. Hartle, senior vice president of the American Council on Education, the umbrella organization for colleges and universities. \u201cAnd we think the New York Fed has serious methodological shortcomings.\u201d\n\nWhere there is a clear causal relationship, he said, is between cuts in state education spending and tuition: \u201cIt\u2019s a perfect inverse relationship: When spending goes down, tuition goes up.\u201d\n\nWith ever-rising tuition, the nation\u2019s outstanding student loan debt now tops $1.2 trillion. A Gallup poll in April showed that 36 percent Americans were worried about having enough money to pay for college for their children.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cDebt-free college is political gold for Democrats,\u201d said Adam Green, a founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, a liberal advocacy group. \u201cThat\u2019s because it\u2019s such great policy for ordinary people.\u201d\n\nThere is widespread interest this year in the idea that colleges and universities should have a stake in ensuring that students are able to repay their student loans \u2014 although it would be tricky to develop a plan that does not lead institutions to avoid needy students who are at risk of defaulting on their debt. And given that so many students transfer in the course of their studies, it would be hard to know which institutions to penalize.\n\nStill, there is bipartisan backing for this part of the Clinton plan. A bill recently introduced by Senators Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire, and Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, would penalize colleges whose students had low repayment rates, cutting off their eligibility to receive student aid.\n\nUnder the Clinton campaign\u2019s estimation that about a third of the cost of its proposal \u2014 almost $12 billion a year \u2014 would go to debt relief, the government would lose the billions of dollars in annual profits it gets from student loans.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cStudent debt has become a profit center for the government, and we do need to revisit that, but I have to warn you that it is going to be obscenely expensive,\u201d said Barmak Nassirian, director of federal relations and policy analysis at the American Association of State Colleges and Universities.\n\nThe Clinton proposal would greatly increase the federal government\u2019s role in higher education, giving it the power to direct \u2014 or withhold \u2014 money to states, rather than funneling support through individual students. Half of the proposed $350 billion over 10 years would go to grants for states that guarantee the students will not need loans to pay the tuition at four-year public universities. But states would be eligible for the federal money only if they slowed tuition growth and stopped cutting their higher education budgets.\n\nAnn O\u2019Leary, senior policy adviser for the Clinton campaign, said Mrs. Clinton\u2019s plan would \u201crevitalize the partnership between the federal government and states \u2014 a concept that was critical to the creation of so many of our great public universities.\u201d\n\nShe acknowledged both the practical and political challenges, particularly in wooing Republican-controlled state legislatures. \u201cBut by unveiling this proposal at such an early stage,\u201d she said, \u201cand putting it at the center of her platform, Hillary Clinton intends to build momentum for this plan throughout the coming months.\u201d\n\nJeffrey A. Engel, the director of the Center for Presidential History at Southern Methodist University, predicted that if Mrs. Clinton was elected, the higher education plan would be difficult enough to pass that it could succeed politically only in the first year of her administration.\n\n\u201cIf you need the states and you need the governors\u2019 consent to make it work for their states, what you\u2019re going to end up with is something similar to what happened with the A.C.A.,\u201d Mr. Engel said, referring to the Affordable Care Act, Mr. Obama\u2019s health care plan. That, he said, is \u201cwhere you have more progressive states developing a more comprehensive and better education system, and more conservative states who are interested in defunding their own universities falling farther and farther behind.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20150813183707, "twitter": {"description": "Mrs. Clinton\u2019s ambitious plan to reduce debt in
