Micah Escamilla \u2014 Staff photographer\n\nAccountant Ken Dewan\u2019s office has been swamped with phone calls lately, and he\u2019s got the U.S. government to thank for it.\n\nThe questions and the confusion about the Affordable Health Care Act just keep coming, and it\u2019s made for some late nights.\n\n\u201cYou cannot believe the number of questions we\u2019re getting on the phone,\u201d said Dewan, office manager and owner of two Liberty Tax Services in Los Angeles. \u201cWe have been very, very busy. We\u2019ve been closing at 11 p.m.\u201d\n\nEven as new healthcare consumers rush to meet a Sunday deadline to sign up for coverage under Obamacare, those who\u2019ve signed up already are scrambling to understand what accountants from the San Fernando Valley to the South Bay to the Inland Empire say are its sweeping tax effects.\n\nWhile April 15 is still weeks away, confusion and questions about certain themes are emerging, with even seasoned taxpayers, used to filing on their own, have questions.\n\nAs Kiak Tae, a tax specialist at ITS Financial Group in Gardena said Wednesday: \u201cIt\u2019s a mess. Everything is so new that each scenario is different, and a lot of people are really clueless.\u201d\n\nAnother way of saying it is that the reality of the penalties for not having insurance seem to be setting in.\n\nThe most-asked question has to do with the penalty a qualified uninsured person must pay for not signing up for health insurance, Dewan said.\n\nMost people think it\u2019s $95. But in reality, the penalty is $95 per adult and $47.50 per child, with a family maximum of $285, or \u2014 for 2014 \u2014 1 percent of the annual household income, whichever is greater. (That 1 percent changes to 2 perent for next year\u2019s filers).\n\nOf the 1.2 million Californians who enrolled into a health plan through Covered California, the state\u2019s health insurance market exchange, 800,000 of them received federal subsidies to help them pay for their coverage. Covered California officials estimated that federal money paid out an average of $5,200 per household per year, or about $436 per month.\n\nBut some people may have to pay those subsidies back. Those who received the 1095-A forms to file federal tax returns this year will learn if what they received was appropriate.\n\n\u201cFor many consumers, their tax credit will need to be adjusted, because their income is different than what they estimated it would be for 2014,\u201d Peter Lee, executive director of Covered California said last month. \u201cAs a result, consumers will see their tax credit adjusted upward or downward in their tax return based on their actual income as reported to the IRS for 2014.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn California, at least 100,000 people received 1095-A\u2019s that had incorrect information. Covered California offials said this week that new forms will be mailed out before the end of the month.\n\nA major challenge is that most taxpayers in California have yet to receive a 1095-A form from the state in order to report whether they are covered through the state health insurance marketplace under the Affordable Care Act, Courts said.\n\n\u201cThey haven\u2019t received it in the mail yet,\u201d said Janet Courts, a Cal State San Bernardino accounting lecturer and coordinator of the university\u2019s Volunteer Income Tax Assistance, or VITA, program. \u201cAnd most taxpayers don\u2019t know what they\u2019re looking at, so they\u2019re not familiar with it.\u201d\n\nGerald Kominski, the director of the UCLA Center for Health Policy and Research, said the document reporting required to the IRS has increased.\n\n\u201cIt has increased the amount of record-keeping for anyone receiving a subsidy,\u201d Kominski said. \u201cIt\u2019s increased their record-keeping for tax purposes, because now they have to track the subsidies they received and the number of months they were insured for tax purposes.\u201d\n\nKominski said that because the subsidies for healthcare are now administered through the tax system, subsidies can change as a result of very small changes in income, and recipients may not receive what they had applied for in an earlier application form. Or, they may owe more in taxes because their actual income did not match the income they had provided in an earlier form.\n\n\u201cOver time, this may lead to a need for some administrative simplification so that people don\u2019t have to recalculate their subsidy based on small changes in their income,\u201d Kominski said. \u201cWhat it would mean is that we would use wider income categories rather than now, where basically, your income is calculated in a continuous line or a continuous function as a separate category.\u201d\n\nIRS officials acknowledge there\u2019s a need to \u201cnavigate these changes.\u201d\n\nIn a help sheet sent out Thursday, they urged taxpayers to note that along with a few new lines on existing forms, two new forms will need to be included in returns. Most taxpayers under the ACA will need only to check a box on their return, showing they had health coverage for all of 2014, officials said in the help sheet.\n\nRegardless, Courts said tax preparers are gearing up.\n\n\u201cThis year, the ACA is our biggest challenge,\u201d Courts said.\n\nAnd Tae is seeing it, adding that it\u2019s taking him about 20 minutes longer to file taxes for people who signed up for insurance on the public exchanges.\n\nAs for taxpayers, San Bernardino resident Evan Bybee, 24, seemed to be doing his best to take the questions and scope of the new tax structure in stride.\n\nHe just signed up to get health insurance through Covered California, but since he\u2019s started to file his tax returns for the first time, he doesn\u2019t see the additional paperwork as an issue. Bybee was getting his returns done through student volunteers at Cal State San Bernardinoon Wednesday.\n\n\u201cFor my generation, and people in my exact situation .... I\u2019m not getting too much of a grip of it,\u201d Bybee said. \u201cI\u2019m learning a new system so it\u2019s not that bad.\u201d\n\nDewan hoped that the learning continues, because taxpayers need a lot more help.\n\n\u201cThis is a game-changer,\u201d he said of the law and its tax ramifcations. \u201cTax preparation has become a lot more complicated, because it\u2019s not a single flow, but a multiple flow. On the taxpayer side, I think there\u2019s a lot more education that needs to be done.\u201d\n\nStaff Writer Jordan England-Nelson contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Accountant Ken Dewan\u2019s office has been swamped with phone calls lately, and he\u2019s got the U.S. government to thank for it.The questions and the confusion about the Affordable Health Care Act just keep coming, and it\u2019s made f", "title": "Affordable Care Act poses new challenges for tax preparation, taxpayers", "og": {"url": "http://www.sbsun.com/government-and-politics/20150212/affordable-care-act-poses-new-challenges-for-tax-preparation-taxpayers", "image": {"width": "1500px", "identifier": "http://www.sbsun.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LG/20150212/NEWS/150219833/AR/0/AR-150219833.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "998px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Affordable Care Act poses new challenges for tax preparation, taxpayers"}, "twitter": {"domain": "sbsun.com", "description": "Accountant Ken Dewan\u2019s office has been swamped with phone calls lately, and he\u2019s got the U.S. government to thank for it.The questions and the confusion about the Affordable Health Care Act just keep coming, and it\u2019s made f", "title": "Affordable Care Act poses new challenges for tax preparation, taxpayers", "url": "http://www.sbsun.com/government-and-politics/20150212/affordable-care-act-poses-new-challenges-for-tax-preparation-taxpayers", "image": {"src": "http://www.sbsun.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LG/20150212/NEWS/150219833/AR/0/AR-150219833.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@sbsun", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id563372734", "iphone": "id503662617", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.sanbernardinosun"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "keywords": "Affordable Care Act, Affordable Care Act", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Affordable Care Act, Affordable Care Act"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI\u2019m learning a new system so it\u2019s not that bad.\u201dDewan hoped that the learning continues, because taxpayers need a lot more help.\nCovered California offials said this week that new forms will be mailed out before the end of the month.\nCovered California officials estimated that federal money paid out an average of $5,200 per household per year, or about $436 per month.\nThe most-asked question has to do with the penalty a qualified uninsured person must pay for not signing up for health insurance, Dewan said.\nThe questions and the confusion about the Affordable Health Care Act just keep coming, and it\u2019s made for some late nights."}
