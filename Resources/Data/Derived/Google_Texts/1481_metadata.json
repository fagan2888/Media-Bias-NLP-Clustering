The new museum will feature standing exhibits on the history and impact of the Bible as well as interactive features to bring viewers into Bible stories and characters.\n\nIt\u2019s the passionate project of Green, the Hobby Lobby billionaire who would prefer to be known for his world-class Bible artifacts collection than for his victorious Supreme Court fight for exemption from the Affordable Care Act contraception mandate.\n\nReligious freedom, he says, is a biblical concept. The Green family \u2014 generations of Pentecostals and Baptists \u2014 has long funded Bible scholarship, biblical archaeology and the drafting of a proposed public school curriculum on the Bible\u2019s historic, cultural and artistic impact on the U.S. and the world.\n\nAll are controversial endeavors, particularly given Green\u2019s personal commitment to spread the good word about the Good Book.\n\nYet, Green insists, this is not an $800 million monument to personal evangelism. Unlike Answers in Genesis, the ministry that launched the Creation Museum in Kentucky and an Ark Encounter park under construction, employees need not pass a Christians-only litmus test. Green said believers, skeptics and the \u201cintellectually curious\u201d alike can visit and learn, just as they might at a science museum.\n\n\u201cThe Bible can speak for itself, explain itself.\u201d\n\nBlowback since the museum\u2019s announcement in 2011 doesn\u2019t bother him. \u201cAnytime you do anything with the Bible, people respond with emotion \u2014 emotion for and against it. That people want to express their love or their hate is not surprising.\u201d\n\nTo Green, the controversies simply prove the timeless intrigue of the Bible. \u201cThere really isn\u2019t a barrier for this book.\u201d\n\nHence, the simple, symbolic and super modern logo featuring a B-as-in-Bible set on its side.\n\nOr is it a lowercase \u2018m\u2019 for museum, underscored?\n\nOr a set of archways leading toward the path of your own choosing?\n\nOr the tablets of the Ten Commandments?\n\nOr the curled open pages of a book?\n\nAll the above, said Jonathan Alger, one of the founding partners of C&G Partners, the design firm that created the logo and brand imagery.\n\nLike the Bible, the logo is \u201ca vessel for what you pour into it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you are making an identity to reflect a museum about the Bible, it has to be simple and respectful,\u201d Alger said.\n\nHis firm aimed for something \u201cstylish, international, unexpected and very modern,\u201d so even the typography mattered. Choice of the font was critical.\n\nThe museum signage and logo are in a European font known as DIN, \u201coriginally invented to make roadway signs in Europe more visible and safe. It was designed for clarity, to help people find their way.\u201d\n\nHow very biblical.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "WASHINGTON (RNS) Museum of the Bible.\n\nThat\u2019s it.\n\nThe name of the museum under construction in Washington, D.C., is official.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need more...", "sailthru.expire_date": "2014-10-06 15:55:58 -0400", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "WASHINGTON (RNS) Museum of the Bible.\n\nThat\u2019s it.\n\nThe name of the museum under construction in Washington, D.C., is official.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need more...", "title": "Hobby Lobby Billionaire Is Making Progress With His Pet Project, 'Museum Of The Bible'", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/05/hobby-lobby-bible-museum_n_5907680.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2116746/images/o-MUSEUM-OF-THE-BIBLE-STEVE-GREEN-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2116746/images/o-MUSEUM-OF-THE-BIBLE-STEVE-GREEN-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "title": "Hobby Lobby Billionaire Is Making Progress With His Pet Project, 'Museum Of The Bible'", "description": "WASHINGTON (RNS) Museum of the Bible.\n\nThat\u2019s it.\n\nThe name of the museum under construction in Washington, D.C., is official.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need more...", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HuffPostRelig"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-10-05 15:55:58 -0400", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=5907680", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "religion", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "museum of the bible,bible,The Bible,hobby lobby,hobby lobby supreme court,museums,bible museum,hobby lobby birth control,christianity,steve green", "article": {"section": "Religion", "tag": "museum of the bible,bible,The Bible,hobby lobby,hobby lobby supreme court,museums,bible museum,hobby lobby birth control,christianity,steve green", "published_time": "2014-10-05 15:55:58 -0400", "modified_time": "2014-10-05 15:59:07 -0400"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "article_summary": "The high-tech museum, set to open in fall 2017, is four blocks from the U.S. Capitol and three blocks from a global tourism mecca, the Air and Space Museum.\nThe new museum will feature standing exhibits on the history and impact of the Bible as well as interactive features to bring viewers into Bible stories and characters.\nThe Washington Post via Getty ImagesWASHINGTON (RNS) Museum of the Bible.\nLike the Bible, the logo is \u201ca vessel for what you pour into it.\u201d\u201cWhen you are making an identity to reflect a museum about the Bible, it has to be simple and respectful,\u201d Alger said.\nGreen said believers, skeptics and the \u201cintellectually curious\u201d alike can visit and learn, just as they might at a science museum."}
