Patty Murray describes it to Yahoo Health, this year\u2019s government shutdown drama \u2014 with Planned Parenthood and women\u2019s reproductive rights squarely in the crossfire \u2014 is nothing new. It\u2019s a veritable Groundhog Day, happening in 2011, in 2013, and now again, in 2015. (Photo: Susan Walsh/AP)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the same story, just running with a different title,\u201d Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., told Yahoo Health in an exclusive interview on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nMurray was speaking of the choice of her Republican colleagues to use the Senate\u2019s critical time before the federal budget deadline on Oct. 1 to attack women\u2019s health \u2014 such as Tuesday\u2019s failed attempt by Senate Republicans to pass a federal 20-week abortion ban \u2014 instead of working on a budget deal to avert a looming shutdown.\n\n\u201cTo me this is d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu,\u201d Murray said, \u201cIn 2011, every item of the budget was agreed to except this one issue. They held out until we had hours to go [until a shutdown]. But women in the House and Senate fought back and were loud and clear \u2014 and they backed down.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s what happened in 2011\u2026\n\nIn April of 2011, a little more than an hour before the midnight deadline that would have forced a partial shutdown of the federal government, congressional leaders and President Obama were able to reach a budget agreement that included $38 billion in across-the-board spending cuts, but did not, as Republicans had previously demanded, eliminate federal funding for Planned Parenthood.\n\n\n\nAt the time, then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, noted that his Republican colleagues could either \u201ckeep their word and significantly cut the federal deficit or they can hold their ground and shut down the government over women\u2019s health. If that sounds ridiculous, it\u2019s because it is ridiculous.\u201d\n\nRelated: Senate Blocks 20-Week Abortion Ban Bill\n\nDuring the looming shutdown in 2011 over Planned Parenthood, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential nominee in 2012, vocally supported Republican efforts to eliminate federal funding to Planned Parenthood. Almost a year after a shutdown was averted, he told a reporter that when it comes to his plans for reducing the deficit: \u201cPlanned Parenthood, we\u2019re going to get rid of that.\u201d\n\nRomney went on to lose to incumbent Barack Obama, who won female voters by 12 points, 56 percent to 44 percent. Romney won among men by 8 points. Gallup said the \u201ctotal 20-point gender gap is the largest Gallup has measured in a presidential election since it began compiling the vote by major subgroups in 1952.\u201d\n\nAnd it happened again in 2013\u2026\n\nMurray notes that when there was an actual shutdown after a budget deal failed to be reached in 2013 \u2014 at the time, Republicans were refusing to move forward on a budget without the repeal of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), known colloquially as Obamacare \u2014 women\u2019s health was also a key component.\n\nRegarding the ACA, she says, \u201cMuch of that has really helped women\u201d \u2014 indeed, critical pieces of the legislation pertained to mandated coverage of well-woman and preventative health care services for women, as well as full coverage without a co-pay for contraception \u2014 \u201cSo that was a personal affront too.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat the Republicans are doing is putting women\u2019s health as hostage to everything else they\u2019re doing \u2014 and today\u2019s vote shows that they don\u2019t have the votes to do it,\u201d Murray says, referring to Tuesday\u2019s Senate block of the bill to ban abortions after 20 weeks.\n\nMurray was so confident that Republicans would not be able to secure the 60 votes needed to pass the abortion ban legislation on Tuesday that she skipped the vote.\n\nMurray instead honored a preexisting commitment to the president of China, Xi Jinping, who arrived in Seattle this morning to meet with technology industry leaders and state elected officials as the first stop in his six-day visit to the United Stated, in advance of his state visit with Obama in D.C. later this week.\n\n\u201cWe have really important issues to talk about, and it\u2019s really important that I be here to meet the president and discuss the economic issues that are important to us and to China, said Murray of her meeting with Xi. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel that partisan posturing should trump the ongoing relationship between the U.S. and China.\u201d\n\nRead More", "article_metadata": {"description": "As\u00a0Sen.
