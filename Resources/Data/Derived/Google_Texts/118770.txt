ROMULUS, Mich. (AP) â€” Authorities say a 50-year-old American Airlines co-pilot grounded on suspicion of drunkenness at a Detroit-area airport heads to court next month.

Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy said Tuesday that John Maguire will be arraigned and have a pre-trial hearing May 11 in in Romulus, a suburb that's home to Detroit Metropolitan Airport. He's been charged with operating under the influence of alcohol stemming from the March 26 incident.

Maguire, from Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania, was removed from the Detroit-to-Philadelphia flight before takeoff. Authorities say he had a blood-alcohol level twice the legal limit.

Defense attorney Frank Manley says he's taking the case "very seriously" and doing "everything necessary to protect the public and Capt. Maguire." Manley adds his client "has an outstanding record as a professional pilot."
