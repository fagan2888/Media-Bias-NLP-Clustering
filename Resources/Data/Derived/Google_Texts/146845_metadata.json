Will It Work?\n\nAMP noted in a press release that the average 15 miles a day of stop-and-go driving for the postal vehicles makes an electric vehicle \u201ca perfect fit to the driving style,\u201d along with the other benefits of low maintenance costs and reduced emissions.\n\nThe company said its trucks have the 150,000-mile range required for the postal vehicles and that its factory is capable of manufacturing the 60,000 vehicles per year that the contract would require.\n\nGiven the 20-year service life of the vehicles, AMP is urging the agency to consider its optional integrated HorseFly package delivery drone which would increase the number of packages the new trucks can deliver in a day.\n\nThe current post office fleet was purchased in the period 1988-93 and are not well adapted to the increased demand for package delivery resulting from online shopping. The new generation of trucks will require the standing room and shelving for packages like UPS and FedEx trucks. In addition, it will have safety features like ABS brakes missing on the older fleet but now standard for vehicles.\n\nRelated: A Big Idea to Save the Post Office: Turn It Into a Bank\n\nThe long-life vehicles in the current fleet were assembled by Grumman, with the chassis, engine, and transmission supplied by General Motors.\n\nThe current bidding for the Next Generation Delivery Vehicle marks only the third time the Postal Service has renewed its fleet in its 45-year existence.\n\nZAP Jonway said it has been working with the postal service for several years to see if the existing vehicles could be converted to an electric power train, but determined that purpose-built EVs would be a better solution.\n\nZAP, based in Santa Rosa, California, works with its majority-owned subsidiary Jonway Auto in China, which has a factory capable of producing 50,000 vehicles a year. The company sees its work on the USPS bid as a springboard for entering the clean energy fleet vehicle market in the US.\n\nEmerald Automotive, based in the St. Louis suburb of Hazelwood, Mo., was acquired last year by the Chinese auto giant Geely, which also owns Volvo. The company intends to build a new assembly factory in the St. Louis area.\n\nUSPS is seeking to cut emissions in half as part of its effort to meet government-mandated sustainability targets.\n\nThis article originally appeared on OilPrice.com.\n\nRead more from OilPrice.com:\n\n\n\nTesla Could Be Changing The Dynamics Of Global Energy\n\nAudi\u2019s Fuel Breakthrough Could Revolutionize The Automotive Sector\n\nKey Signals That Oil Prices Are On The Up", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Electric, compressed natural gas, flex fuel and hybrid vehicles are all in contention", "title": "The Postal Service\u2019s Ancient Fleet is Getting a $6 Billion Upgrade", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/04/US-Postal-Service-s-Ancient-Fleet-Getting-6-Billion-Upgrade", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/08112011_Post_Office_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/04/US-Postal-Service-s-Ancient-Fleet-Getting-6-Billion-Upgrade", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/08112011_Post_Office_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Electric, compressed natural gas, flex fuel and hybrid vehicles are all in contention", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The company sees its work on the USPS bid as a springboard for entering the clean energy fleet vehicle market in the US.\nThe current bidding for the Next Generation Delivery Vehicle marks only the third time the Postal Service has renewed its fleet in its 45-year existence.\nThe current post office fleet was purchased in the period 1988-93 and are not well adapted to the increased demand for package delivery resulting from online shopping.\nRelated: Post Office Uses a Celebrity Lifeline.\nBut smaller companies, such as electric vehicle makers ZAP Jonway and Emerald Automotive, are also on the list, as well as AMP Holding, another EV maker that is pitching its integrated drones to USPS."}
