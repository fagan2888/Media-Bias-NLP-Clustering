(David R. Jennings / Staff Photographer)\n\nLYONS \u2014 Just because Quinn McConnell is a freshman, it doesn't mean that she's a rookie. In fact, in this early cross country season, she might be one of the most impactful girls runners on the scene right now.\n\nThe Peak to Peak athlete stormed to a sixth place finish at the Centaurus Invite last week, and added to her resume with a victory in the Class 3A/2A Division of Saturday's St. Vrain Invitational at Lyons High School.\n\nMcConnell finished just ahead of teammate Anna Shults, while Lyons' Sierra Tucker placed seventh on her home course. The Pumas finished first in the team race, too.\n\nWith many of the best runners from the larger schools migrating to the Liberty Bell at Heritage High \u2014 an event that took place Friday \u2014 the St. Vrain still holds serve as the premier race of the season for the smaller schools. That was evident in both the boys and girls races, as Paul Roberts (Lyons) held off Ben Butler of SkyView Academy and Taylor Stack (Salida) in a heavy-duty showdown.\n\nFor McConnell, the start to the season has been everything she has hoped for. She finished Saturday's race with a time of 18 minutes, 57 seconds.\n\n\"I just put in a good summer in hopes that I'd have a strong season, and last weekend I really surprised myself with my time against some of the (Class 4A and 5A) girls,\" said McConnell who was last year's state middle school champion. \"This week, I knew some really fast girls were going to be here. I'm happy with it.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShults and McConnell were neck-and-neck for most of the race and pulled ahead of the rest of the pack late. Shults, also a freshman, finished in 19:10.\n\n\"Our regionals course is this one, and it's a fun course you can enjoy,\" McConnell said.\n\n\"Our coach has been talking to us about how running should be a team thing, and that every point counts,\" added Shults. \"We need to work together. Quinn and I pace off each other, and we want to work together to get a better score. We were focused on the team perspective of this race.\"\n\nPeak to Peak's top-notch effort was buoyed by Rachael Metzler, (11th place) and Christina Hamerly (19th). The Pumas were so good, Alice Oveson's 22nd place finish did not even score.\n\nLyons finished fourth overall with a team that was battling sickness this week. Tucker's time was 20:24, and CeAnn Udovich \u2014 who finished second at state last year \u2014 finished just outside the top 20 as she is battling injury.\n\nTucker was hoping to be just a little bit better but was glad to have faced off against some of the girls she'll be battling at state again this year.\n\n\"More than half our team was sick this week, and I know CeAnn didn't have the race she would have liked,\" Tucker said. \"I felt pretty strong, but I wasn't as competitive as I wanted to be. My regret from the race was not trying to stick up front from the beginning.\n\n\"I'm proud and exciting for the rest of my team, because we had girls breaking 22 (minutes) and getting personal bests.\"\n\nOn the boys side, Roberts challenged the course record he tied last year, finishing in 15:18 (the record is 15:15). Joel Such finished fifth overall with a time of 16:40.\n\nAdam Dunivan: dunivana@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/AdamDunivan24\n\nSt. Vrain Cross Country Invitational\n\nAt Lyons HS\n\nClass 2A/3A Boys\n\nTeam scores \u2014 Salida 57, SkyView Academy 79, Lyons 83, Mancos 114, Ouray 130, Rocky Ford 143, The Vanguard School 149, Telluride 156, Estes Park 160, Jefferson Academy 175, St. Mary's 208, Eaton 240, Middle Park 240, Resurrection Christian 246, Liberty Common 251, Peak to Peak 254, Heritage Christian 276, Platte Valley 284, Byers 306, Machebeuf 307, Yuma 363, Wiggins 407, Highland 456, Brush 457, Nederland 485, Dawson School 510, Twin Peaks Charter 548, West Grand 551.\n\nTop 10 individuals \u2014 1.
