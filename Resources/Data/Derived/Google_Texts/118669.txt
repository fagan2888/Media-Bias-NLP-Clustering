Humboldt County Department of Health and Human Services Director Phil Crandall announced his retirement to employees today, Humboldt County Department of Health and Human Services public information manager Heather Muller wrote in an email to the Times-Standard.

The following is Phil Crandall’s statement to Humboldt County Department of Health and Human Services employees:

After 31 years of public service, 15 of those as your director, I have decided to retire effective January 31, 2016.

As the year unfolds, I will work with senior staff on transition issues related to managed care, regional approaches to the Affordable Care Act and the planned implementation of an enhanced system to assess and house the homeless in Humboldt County using state of the art Rapid Rehousing and Housing First approaches. Additionally, of course, I’ll be working to prepare the department for the changes ahead.

This next year will be business as usual. I will continue to work to achieve the department’s mission and vision, and I know you and the new leadership team will carry it forward from there.

A life spent in service to others is, I believe, a life well spent. It is and has been an honor to serve this community, and an honor to be your director.
