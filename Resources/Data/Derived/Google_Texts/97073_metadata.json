But senators said opposition to the law is because of the aggressive campaign against it, but polls also show the public supports the components of the law, including the elimination of the pre-existing condition exclusion and extension of parental coverage.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe rhetoric surrounding health care reform, something both parties have been calling for, has been twisted around to make it seem like it\u2019s a bad thing that sick people can afford quality health care, that young people can stay on their parent\u2019s health plans for a few years after they graduate,\u201d Weis said.", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "A college student from Bergen County told of his fight with thyroid and lymphatic cancer during a news conference in the U.S. Capitol Tuesday as Democratic senators tried to highlight benefits that would be lost if the Affordable Care Act were repealed.", "copyright": "North Jersey Media Group Inc.", "author": "HERB JACKSON", "og": {"url": "http://www.northjersey.com/cm/2.1593/news/college-student-from-glen-rock-talks-in-capitol-of-obamacare-benefits-1.732876", "site_name": "NorthJersey.com", "image": "http://www.northjersey.com:80/polopoly_fs/1.732877!/fileImage/httpImage/030414healthbergen-dngnk.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A college student from Bergen County told of his fight with thyroid and lymphatic cancer during a news conference in the U.S. Capitol Tuesday as Democratic senators tried to highlight benefits that would be lost if the Affordable Care Act were repealed."}, "title": "College student from Glen Rock talks in Capitol of Obamacare benefits", "robots": "noarchive,noodp,noydir", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=446490632", "fb": {"admins": "100002050123125,739916158,1235266096", "app_id": 130358300392751}, "DC.creator": "HERB JACKSON", "msvalidate.01": "697A26605161B513EFE2AD6E581F4AA8", "google-site-verification": "swyvR_LXSGMOxOz1638gujs38OoVP3sZwJgdjySjnXM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=2.0, user-scalable=yes", "DC.title": "College student from Glen Rock talks in Capitol of Obamacare benefits"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd124e\"", "article_summary": "His mother\u2019s plan previously covered him until he graduated college, but now can cover him until he reaches age 26.\n\u201cI am a statistic about cancer, but I\u2019m also covered because of the Affordable Care Act,\u201d said Weis, who plans to continue on his mother\u2019s plan after graduation.\nWeis, of Glen Rock, also speculated about what might have been.\nA poll released Tuesday showed a slim majority of 51 percent of New Jersey voters support repealing the health insurance law, while 44 percent oppose repeal.\n\u201cThe rhetoric surrounding health care reform, something both parties have been calling for, has been twisted around to make it seem like it\u2019s a bad thing that sick people can afford quality health care, that young people can stay on their parent\u2019s health plans for a few years after they graduate,\u201d Weis said."}
