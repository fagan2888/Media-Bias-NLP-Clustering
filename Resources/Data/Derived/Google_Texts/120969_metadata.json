Given the climate of hostility toward immigrants in many parts of the country, and the Obama administration\u2019s love affair with deportation, you\u2019d expect him to be sitting in a holding cell awaiting a one-way trip out of the country.\n\nAt least you would expect that if he were poor, obscure and, say, Hispanic. But what if the malfeasant were wealthy, famous and, say, Justin Bieber?\n\nLet me be clear: I\u2019m not saying that Mr. Bieber should lose the visa he was granted because of his \u201cextraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, education, business or athletics.\u201d (I also don\u2019t think it was right for Richard Nixon to try to deport John Lennon 40 years ago, using a misdemeanor pot charge as a bogus excuse.) Nor am I commenting on how extraordinary Mr. Bieber is not. (Oops.)\n\nIt\u2019s just worth pointing out that apart from the humor value of the traffic bust, which followed closely on the heels of Mr. Bieber\u2019s infamous neighbor-egging caper, it is in a small way emblematic of the capricious, unbalanced and racially charged way in which immigration policy is conceived and enforced in this country.\n\nIt\u2019s a bipartisan failing. Under President George W. Bush, Immigration and Customs Enforcement enjoyed high-profile busts \u2014 like the Postville Raid of 2008, when agents found (mostly) Mexicans and Guatemalans working without papers in a meat plant in Iowa, arrested them, and then deported them, devastating scores of families and the town where they lived.\n\nPresident Obama promised to focus more on removing violent and dangerous criminals, and kept promising to do that, but deportations in his first term rose to record levels, about 400,000 a year. That number has dropped recently, but thousands of non-criminals and minor offenders are still being swept into the dragnet.\n\n\n\nThe answer is not to treat all immigrants equally badly and deport Mr. Bieber. We certainly don\u2019t want to discourage Canadian entertainers from coming to America. It would be hard to put on a concert or movie or TV show without them, given the disproportionately large number of \u201cAmerican\u201d talent that comes from Canada.\n\nThe answer is to stop pretending that deportation \u2014 which punishes hard working people but not their employer-enablers \u2014 is an effective tool for dealing with our immigration problems.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20140123142941, "BN": "takingnote", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "takingnote", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/takingnote/post", "per": "Bieber, Justin", "keywords": "Bieber Justin,Deportation,Immigration and Emigration,Featured Posts", "GBLC": "Featured Posts", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/takingnote/If Justin Bieber Weren't Famous ( 20140123 )", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Andrew Rosenthal", "SCG": "takingnote", "sourceApp": "blogs", "CLMST": "Andrew Rosenthal", "byl": "Andrew Rosenthal", "twitter": {"url": "http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/23/if-justin-bieber-werent-famous/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "description": "The singer, a foreign national, was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence.
