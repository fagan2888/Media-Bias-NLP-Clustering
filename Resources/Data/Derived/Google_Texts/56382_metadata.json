Apparently, millennials are now swayed by modern-day myths that they have been taught. The Pied Piper, Hansel and Gretel\u2019s witch offering sweet cakes and gingerbread and Snow White being offered the apple were allegories, meant to warn children against blandishments and the consequences of accepting them. The modern purveyors of these myths are offering Robin Hood and Pied Piper socialistic schemes, which millennials have been taught to grab. They have not been warned that such a government may quickly turn into a wolf.\n\nElaine Wempen\n\nIrvine\n\nBerned by socialism\n\nThere should be no surprise at the clamor of college-age people for Bernie Sanders\u2019 socialism, and it\u2019s not only due to a distaste for Hillary\u2019s history and persona. These young people are products of an academic system that simply doesn\u2019t allow diversion from liberal teachings, and they come out of that system with very little understanding of how true capitalism functions, or why socialism doesn\u2019t.\n\nMore\u2019s the pity, because capitalism, if kept vigilantly free from corruption and monopolies, pumps wealth and employment into an economy through the profit incentive, even while driving down those profits, and consequently the costs of goods and services, through competition. In comparison, socialism eats away any chance of the good life for its citizens because government can give away goodies only up to a point, since it never produces anything on its own.\n\nSocialism eventually turns any country that tries it upside down by debt accumulated through weakly funded giveaway programs. Its proponents have never figured out why they aren\u2019t able to fund their programs by simply raising taxes beyond economic break-even levels, or why eliminating incentive and/or driving away its major taxpayers somehow produces lower overall revenue and employment.\n\nCollegians have now been far too indoctrinated to understand any of this. Scarily, they might now form up with the greater masses being propagandized by other institutions that have also been taken over by progressives \u2013 most of the media, entertainment and the like \u2013 into a gathering storm over American capitalism. If so, by the time they begin experiencing the impoverishing results of their promised life under socialism, they could well also find themselves forbidden to reverse course.\n\nTed Robinson\n\nNewport Beach\n\nBoth sides lie\n\nI have just read Mark Landsbaum\u2019s column \u201cWhy we trust those we know are lying to us\u201d [Opinion, Feb. 13]. I naively thought it would be fairly objective and even nonpartisan, especially with the blizzard of accusations of lying on the Republican side.\n\nBut I was surprised even at ultraconservative Mr. Landsbaum\u2019s totally one-sided take on the subject. Even if his accusations about Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are 100 percent true, these pale by comparison with the Republican side. For example, the Register published a Fact Check after a recent Republican debate. It examines Ted Cruz lying about Obamacare and refutes all of his statements. It also refuted Chris Christie\u2019s claims regarding the economy. And this was just from one debate.\n\nPhilip Peace\n\nLake Forest\n\nWomen and Selective Service\n\nThe issue is not whether the draft will ever be instituted again. The issue is that we have given equal rights, for the most part, to everyone over 18 years of age. Women and the law have demanded equal pay for equal work, and these rights have been extended into every field, including combat.\n\nSo for women not to register for the draft would be discriminatory. All it would take is for one male to file suit and take it all the way to the Supreme Court. The court would have no choice but to rule in favor of the man.\n\nJoseph Saraceno\n\nGardena\n\nSuds along the shore\n\nSitting on a towel at Doheny State Beach on the Fourth of July, I watched a group of four sheriff\u2019s deputies marching down the beach. They looked inside every cooler, sniffed a few drinking glasses and turned over blankets in their search for alcoholic beverages. I thought it was to prevent some intoxicated swimmer from drowning, or from causing a scene. There is a cafe right on the sand that serves beer and wine, and soon there will be beer and wine served at Bolsa Chica State Park.\n\nIt is now clear to me. The alcohol inquisition I witnessed was just a means of ensuring that the vendors have no competition. I hope the Sheriff\u2019s Department gets a cut of the profits.\n\nWayne Via\n\nDana Point", "article_metadata": {"geo.placename": "Santa Ana", "geo.region": "US-CA", "content_section": "commentary", "description": "Opinion: Letters: Keep religious views away from policy | religious, socialism, point, right, government, one, equal, down, religion, through", "geo.position": "33.745573;-117.867834", "og": {"site_name": "The Orange County Register", "description": "Perhaps the religious right is losing influence as Joel Kotkin suggests [\u201cReligious right being left behind,\u201d Opinion, Feb. 14], but the cause may go beyond the statistics on demographics and church attendance he uses to make the point.
