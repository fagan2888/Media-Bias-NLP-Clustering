Ezra tries to get us to appreciate just how good the Obamacare news has been with a thought experiment:\n\nImagine taking a time machine back to 2010 and telling Republicans in Congress, who were arguing that the CBO was wildly underestimating Obamacare\u2019s cost, that the law would be cheaper than predicted and, at least in the states that accepted its Medicaid dollars, cover more people than the Congressional Budget Office thought. After the laughing and mocking and the calling of security, let\u2019s say you offered this prediction in the form a of a bet. What odds do you think Obamacare\u2019s critics would have offered? 2:1? 5:1? 10:1?\n\nBut you don\u2019t have to go back to 2010. Look at John Cochrane in late 2013, taking it for granted that Obamacare would implode in a death spiral within a few months. Look at The Hill just four months ago, telling us that double-digit premium hikes were coming.\n\nOne question we might ask here is, why is the news so good? The answer, I\u2019d suggest \u2014 although I hope the real experts will weigh in \u2014 is that we\u2019re actually seeing the opposite of a death spiral; call it a life spiral. For one thing, the huge surge in enrollments late in the day meant that the risk pool this year is better than insurers expected, and they now expect 2015 to be better still. Also, importantly, big enrollments mean that more insurers are entering the market, increasing competition. And, of course, the better the deal the more people will sign up: success feeds success.\n\nAnother question we might ask: Is our conservatives learning? Are those who bought into the death spiral stories, who seized on every hint of bad news, asking themselves how they got it so wrong? Are they, maybe, considering the possibility that they\u2019re listening to the wrong people, that maybe Jon Gruber knows what he\u2019s talking about and John Goodman is a hack?\n\nHahahaha.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20140905093849, "BN": "krugman", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/krugman", "DISPLAYDATE": "September 5, 2014", "keywords": "Uncategorized", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/krugman/Obamacare Life Spiral ( 20140905 )", "PT": "Blogs", "SCG": "krugman", "sourceApp": "blogs", "twitter": {"description": "Success feeds on itself.", "title": "Obamacare Life Spiral", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/05/obamacare-life-spiral/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "site": "@NytimesKrugman", "card": "summary"}, "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/krugman/post", "description": "Success feeds on itself.", "CG": "Opinion", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "September 5, 2014", "article": {"published_time": 1409924329, "author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/paulkrugman/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Uncategorized", "modified_time": "2014-09-05T13:38:49-04:00"}, "utime": 20140905133849, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20140905, "pdate": 20140905, "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Paul Krugman Blog", "description": "Success feeds on itself.", "title": "Obamacare Life Spiral", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/05/obamacare-life-spiral/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/05/obamacare-life-spiral/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "Obamacare Life Spiral", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "article_summary": "The answer, I\u2019d suggest \u2014 although I hope the real experts will weigh in \u2014 is that we\u2019re actually seeing the opposite of a death spiral; call it a life spiral.\nLook at John Cochrane in late 2013, taking it for granted that Obamacare would implode in a death spiral within a few months.\nAre those who bought into the death spiral stories, who seized on every hint of bad news, asking themselves how they got it so wrong?\nAfter the laughing and mocking and the calling of security, let\u2019s say you offered this prediction in the form a of a bet.\nLook at The Hill just four months ago, telling us that double-digit premium hikes were coming."}
