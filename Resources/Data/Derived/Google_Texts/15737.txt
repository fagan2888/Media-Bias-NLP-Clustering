One of the ten principles of the "Code of the West" by James P. Owen (cowboyethics.com) is "Ride for the Brand." At first glance, you may think this is specifically meant for cowboys of the west or ranchers with a family brand. However, if you give it a little thought and dig a little deeper there is great meaning to "Riding for the Brand."

A brand can be lots of things; typically we think of our family brand/crest or company logo. Although these are brands and things that we are likely dedicated to, a brand is anything that we show loyalty. Things that we value and give respect. Things we pass on to our family. Your own special mark that you are willing to protect. So "Riding for the Brand" is living for, standing up for, and dedicating your time to what is important to you.

I encourage each of you to give this some thought. What do you hold above all else that you would be willing to call your brand? What are you loyal to? Youth sometimes have difficulty showing others what they stand for. Sometimes things that are imprortant to them gets overshadowed by what others want from them.

Create your own brand and make it meaningful to you. Unlike ranch brands there are no limits to the characters you can use; include anything that is important to you. Reflect on this, these are the things that symbolize you and why you live your life they way you do. I encourage you to keep your brand in the front of your mind and make sure to always Ride for YOUR brand!
