One person is dead and another seriously injured after two crashes involving motorcycles took place within an hour of each other in Aurora, officials said.

The Aurora Police Department responded to East Iliff Avenue at South Blackhawk Street around 5 p.m. regarding a crash involving a vehicle and motorcycle, according to an Aurora Police Department news release.

The release said witnesses told authorities that a motorcycle was traveling eastbound on Iliff Avenue at “a high rate of speed” when a silver sedan was headed westbound and making a left turn onto southbound South Blackhawk Street.

The motorcycle hit the right passenger side of the sedan, the release said, projecting the motorcycle driver, who was wearing a helmet, onto the street.

The motorcyclist was pronounced dead at the scene.

The woman driving the sedan along with her three passengers were taken to a local hospital with non-life threatening injuries, the release said.

The Aurora Police Traffic Section is investigating this crash and believes excessive speed was a contributing factor. Police do not know if alcohol or drugs were a factor, the release said.

While investigating this crash, another accident involving a motorcycle and automobile occurred around 6:30 p.m. at East Iliff Avenue at South Xapary Street, according to the release.

Police determined that a motorcycle driven by a 50-year-old man rear-ended a car that was stopped in traffic. The man was projected from the motorcycle and transported to a hospital with serious injuries.

The release said it is unknown if the man’s injuries are life-threatening and that he was not wearing a helmet.

“Alcohol is suspected to be a contributing factor in this crash,” the release said.

Police did not release the names of anyone involved in either crash.
