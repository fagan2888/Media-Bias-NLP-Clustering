The Heat, according to ESPN.com, have also explored their options to possibly pursue Anthony.\n\nThe Knicks brought on Phil Jackson late last season as their new president with the hope that he would be able to lure Anthony into staying and attract others to New York. Jackson has tried to hire Steve Kerr, whom he coached alongside Michael Jordan in Chicago, as the new coach of the Knicks, but Kerr opted for the Warriors instead.\n\nJackson then turned to Derek Fisher, the former players\u2019 union president and Thunder guard, take over as as a first-year coach.\n\nAnthony, 30, was traded to New York in February of 2011 as part of a 13-player deal that involved the Timberwolves. To acquire Anthony, the Knicks essentially gutted their roster to make room for him. New York shipped Danilo Gallinari, Wilson Chandler, Raymond Felton and Timofey Mozgov to Denver, while sending Anthony Randolph and Eddy Curry to Minnesota.\n\nAnthony helped the Knicks to the playoffs three times since joining them in late 2011, but they failed to make it past the second round. New York finished with a 37-45 record last season, missing the postseason for the first time since 2010.\n\nNicki Jhabvala: njhabvala@denverpost.com and @nickijhabvala", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1504\"", "article_summary": "According to Wojnarowski\u2019s sources, Anthony is \u201cdetermined to explore free agency\u201d and will look closely at the Bulls and Rockets.\nCarmelo Anthony will notify the Knicks on Monday that he will opt out of the final year of his contract, worth about $23.5 million, and test free agency, Yahoo Sports\u2019 Adrian Wojnarowski reported Sunday.\nAnthony, 30, was traded to New York in February of 2011 as part of a 13-player deal that involved the Timberwolves.\nTo acquire Anthony, the Knicks essentially gutted their roster to make room for him.\nIn addition to the Bulls and Rockets though, Anthony would reportedly also consider the Mavericks."}
