Sun Life hopes the deal will help it increase stop-loss sales to midsize employers.

Sun Life Financial Inc. (TSX:SLF) made headlines Wednesday by agreeing to spend up to $975 million in cash and subordinated debt to acquire Assurant Employee Benefits.

Assurant Inc. (NYSE:AIZ) earlier announced plans to sell the benefits unit and shut down its health insurance unit. Assurant President Alan Colberg said his company will use the Sun Life deal as an opportunity to sharpen its focus on housing and lifestyle protection products and services.
