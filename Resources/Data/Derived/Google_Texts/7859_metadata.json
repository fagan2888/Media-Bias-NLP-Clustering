Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) to oppose the fast-track legislation moving through Congress. All three senators are running for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination.\n\n\u201cCongress is getting ready to give Obama more power, just when we\u2019re getting ready to choose his replacement,\u201d the ad says. \u201cIf Congress gives Obama fast-track power, he\u2019ll use it to write more regulations for our economy -- for the entire world. Rules that the next president won\u2019t be able to change.\u201d\n\nListeners are told to \u201cTell Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and Rand Paul\u201d to vote against the fast-track legislation. It further states, \u201cWe need a real conservative, not another politician who says one thing and does another.\u201d\n\nThe ad shows how the trade deal has divided conservatives, despite the perception it has widespread Republican support. Groups like the American Jobs Alliance, United States Business and Industry Council, Tea Party Nation and Eagle Forum have announced opposition to the pact. The Americans for Limited Government ad directs listeners to the American Jobs Alliance website, Obamatrade.com.\n\nRick Manning, president of Americans for Limited Government, explained why conservatives should oppose the trade deal in a statement on the group\u2019s website. \u201cProponents of the Pacific trade deal face irreconcilable problems that on one hand, they bemoan Obama\u2019s executive regulatory overreach in areas like amnesty, Obamacare, and Net Neutrality, yet, they claim that Congress should cede to the same president an enormous grant of power that eviscerates the advice and consent treaty ratification process. You can\u2019t be pro-Constitution with one press release and in favor of shredding it in the next and call yourself a constitutional conservative.\u201d\n\nIn December, 19 House members, including some who did not return to the current Congress, sent a letter to Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) echoing these concerns.\n\n\u201cThe habitual abuses of power by this president have eroded the faith of the American people, who no longer trust his judgment or leadership,\u201d they wrote.\n\nThe targets of Americans for Limited Government\u2019s ad campaign have voiced varied levels of support for granting the White House trade promotion authority.\n\nRubio and Cruz have both backed trade promotion authority, while Paul has sent mixed messages. The first-term Kentucky senator told The Huffington Post in December, \u201cI'm definitely for the trade pact. I haven't fully decided on\" Trade Promotion Authority.\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Potential 2016 Presidential Contenders Potential 2016 Presidential Contenders\n\n1 of 33 Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton (D) Share this slide:\n\nSpencer Platt via Getty Images", "article_metadata": {"description": "WASHINGTON -- The debate over granting President Barack Obama fast-track authority to negotiate and approve the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal is c...", "sailthru.expire_date": "2015-04-23 22:32:16 -0400", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "WASHINGTON -- The debate over granting President Barack Obama fast-track authority to negotiate and approve the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal is c...", "title": "Tea Party Group Brings Trade Deal Opposition To New Hampshire Primary", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/22/tea-party-trade-deal_n_7121954.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2868426/images/o-2016-TRADE-DEAL-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "WASHINGTON -- The debate over granting President Barack Obama fast-track authority to negotiate and approve the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal is c...", "creator": "PaulBlu", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2868426/images/o-2016-TRADE-DEAL-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "title": "Tea Party Group Brings Trade Deal Opposition To New Hampshire Primary", "site": "@HuffPostPol", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-04-22 22:32:16 -0400", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=7121954", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "free trade,tpp,Trans-Pacific Partnership,tea party,New Hampshire Primary,2016 election,elections 2016,rand paul,Ted Cruz,Marco Rubio,Trade Promotion Authority,trade deals", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "free trade,tpp,Trans-Pacific Partnership,tea party,New Hampshire Primary,2016 election,elections 2016,rand paul,Ted Cruz,Marco Rubio,Trade Promotion Authority,trade deals", "published_time": "2015-04-22 22:32:16 -0400", "modified_time": "2015-04-22 22:59:01 -0400"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9e6b\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIf Congress gives Obama fast-track power, he\u2019ll use it to write more regulations for our economy -- for the entire world.\nRick Manning, president of Americans for Limited Government, explained why conservatives should oppose the trade deal in a statement on the group\u2019s website.\nAll three senators are running for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination.\nDarren McCollester via Getty ImagesWASHINGTON -- The debate over granting President Barack Obama fast-track authority to negotiate and approve the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal is coming to the Republican presidential primary campaign in New Hampshire.\nAmericans for Limited Government, a conservative group founded by wealthy activist Howard Rich, will begin radio ads in New Hampshire on Thursday, calling on Sens."}
