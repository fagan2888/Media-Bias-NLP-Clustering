(Published Wednesday, Oct. 23, 2013)\n\nJohn Mazur decided to decorate his yard with anti-Obamacare-themed Halloween decorations.\n\nThe front lawn of his home, in addition to being adorned by ghosts and faux-cobwebs, has graves painted with \"U.S. Economy R.I.P,\" \"American Healthcare\" and \"Socialized Medicine,\" among others.\n\nWhile Mazur chose to decorate his home with a decidedly political message, the veterinarian said he is not a political activist.\n\n\u201cFor those who disagree, or for some reason think Obamacare works for them, I hope they appreciate the tongue and cheek aspect also,\u201c Mazur told WCNC.\n\nSOMEONE CALL 911!\n\n\n\nOne Oklahoma family shocked their neighbors with realistic Halloween Decorations.\n\nWhen the Mullins family decided to go \"all-out\" for Halloween this year and decorate their driveway with what appeared to be two dead bodies, they never expected neighbors to call 9-1-1, according to WMTV.\n\n\"Scare people, that's what I like to do,\" said Johnnie Mullins, who owns the home, in an AP interview.\n\nThe family was inspired by decorating tips from the social media site Pinterest.\n\nBROOKLYN BABY DOLL MASSACRE\n\nResidents of Brooklyn's Bergen street are complaining about a Halloween display that features some macabre images of baby dolls, NBC New York reported.\n\nThe scary scene features mutilated dolls scattered across the lawn, covered in fake blood and in various states of gore. There is also a jack-o-lantern headed surgeon who seems to be performing a rather unsuccessful operation on a doll hooked up to an IV.\n\n\"This is some sick, twisted-minded stuff,\" said Valerie Bell, who lives nearby.\n\nSo far, no calls to the police have been made and the decorations remain in place.\n\nNUISCANCE IN NEW JERSEY\n\nWayne Ganges has been decorating his Clifton, N.J. home with ghosts, goblins and zombies for the past 13 years. His impressive display features decorations that cover nearly every inch of his home's corner lot, including trees and lighting fixtures on the curb.\n\nNow, the municipality is claiming that the decorations are causing traffic and safety issues due to the number of spectators that come to his home to look at the display, according to a report by NBC New York.\n\nGanges was asked to remove the portion of his display that is on city property. He decided to take down all decorations, saying there \"was no point\" if he was going to be forced to remove such a large portion.\n\nSome neighbors are happy that the display is being removed citing reduced traffic issues making the neighborhood safer. Others hope that Ganges will reconsider and comply with city regulations.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Halloween decorations give homeowners the opportunity to express their love for the holiday with often-grisly decor.
