According to the Beast, Couric was slammed for doing a glamorous photo shoot with Harper\u2019s Bazarre in 2010, when CBS News was slashing jobs. Weller reportedly writes that it felt like Couric, who was making $15 million a year, \u201cwas rubbing in her privilege while so many women saw themselves, or their friends, cleaning their desks and saying goodbye.\u201d\n\nWeller reportedly \u201cspoke extensively to friends and associates of the trio, with the principals\u2019 permission, but not directly to Couric, Sawyer, or Amanpour,\u201d according to the Beast.\n\nAfter leaving CBS, Couric hosted a daytime talk show, which was panned as an \u201cunmitigated disaster\u201d before getting canceled.
