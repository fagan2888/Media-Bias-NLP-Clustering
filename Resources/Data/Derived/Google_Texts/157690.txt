Sen. Ted Cruz wants to #MakeDCListen. On Tuesday, the Texas senator began a talk-a-thon to voice his opposition to the Affordable Care Act as the Senate prepared to vote on a spending bill from the House that would fund the government through Dec. 15, but defund the president’s health care law. “I don’t know if it’s the water, something in the air, the cherry blossoms,” Cruz said near the beginning of his speech, “but people get [to D.C.] and they stop listening to the American people.”

It is time to #MakeDCListen and that is a point I intend to make over and over again — Senator Ted Cruz (@SenTedCruz) September 24, 2013

The hashtag #MakeDCListen received more than 500,000 mentions on Twitter by the end of Cruz’ speech on Wednesday—from both sides of the aisle. http://storify.com/BashirLive/ted-cruz-wants-to-makedclisten
