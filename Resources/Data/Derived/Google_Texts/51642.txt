Thirty-two percent of shoppers used the "click and collect" purchasing method this holiday season, purchasing items online and then picking them up in-store, according to the Holiday Consumer Purchasing Trends study published by the International Council of Shopping Centers (ICSC). Sixty-nine percent of those shoppers purchased items when they were in stores to collect their digital purchase, and 36% made a purchase at a nearby store. Nearly all consumers, 91%, purchased items in a physical store during the holidays. More than 1,000 adult consumers were surveyed between Dec. 28 and Dec. 30 for this study.
