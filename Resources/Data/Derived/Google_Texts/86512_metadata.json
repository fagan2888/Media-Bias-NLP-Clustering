His disparaging remarks about GOP candidate Cary Fiorina\u2014\u201cLook at that face! Would anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next president?\u201d\u2014made headlines. This just weeks after his crude comments about Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly, when he suggested that she had asked him particularly tough questions during the first GOP debate in August because she was menstruating.\n\nDespite such blunders and his controversial remarks on issues like immigration, \u201cthe Donald\u201d is the leading Republican front-runner, much to the consternation of party organizers and presidential candidates like Jeb Bush and Scott Walker. In a new Washington Post/ABC News poll, Trump led the field of Republican presidential aspirants with 33 percent of the vote. Bush received just 8 percent.\n\nBut there are subtle indications that the ground may be shifting. Fiorina made a strong showing in last Thursday\u2019s second GOP debate, and another Republican candidate, retired physician Ben Carson, has moved from 6 percent to 23 percent in two recent New York Times/CBS News polls.\n\nDespite Trump\u2019s standing in the polls, serious questions remain about whether he can win the White House. So this week\u2019s YouSpeak asks: \u201cIs Donald Trump electable?\u201d\n\n\u201cYouSpeak\u201d typically appears on Mondays.
