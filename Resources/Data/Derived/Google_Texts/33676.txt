For Hillary Clinton, the best Super Bowl defense is some offense - unless it's the other way around.

The former secretary of state roiled the Twitterverse midway through tonight's big game with a rare tweet that seemed to respond to the aggressive media coverage she's drawn of late.

"It's so much more fun to watch FOX when it's someone else being blitzed & sacked! #SuperBowl," Clinton Tweeted from @HillaryClinton.

No specifics followed from her or from the Clinton camp, but the tweet was immediately interpreted as a reference to Fox News Channel's coverage of all things Clinton, starting with continued questioning of the tragic incident in Benghazi, Libya.

Her Tweet came just hours after President Obama sparred with Fox News host Bill O'Reilly over Fox's coverage of his administration in a pre-game interview.

O'Reilly questioned Obama on the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi and the IRS scandal - two issues the president said have been drummed up by Fox News.

"These kinds of things keep on surfacing in part because you and your TV station will promote them," the president said in the live 10-minute interview.
