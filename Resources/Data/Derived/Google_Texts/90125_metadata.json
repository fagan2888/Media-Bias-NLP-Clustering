With the theme of \u201cTransforming Healthcare: Partnerships, Innovations and Population Health,\u201d the conference assembled a unique faculty of individuals who brought with them road-tested experience in tackling many of the challenges and opportunities that confront healthcare leaders today.\n\n\u201cThere can be little doubt that healthcare reform has shaken the traditional model of delivery to its roots,\u201d said Phil Dalton, MDS president and conference sponsor. \u201cThe move to value-based reimbursement and population health management is causing radical organizational turmoil and change. But it is also opening the doors to new opportunities, new ways to serve the community, and new pathways to success. These are things that every hospital, health system and physician organization should desire as they position themselves for a future that is close at hand.\u201d\n\nIn looking at this new era of healthcare, Welltok Chairman and CEO Jeff Margolis told the gathering that \u201cPopulation health starts with consumers, not patients, and truly understanding the factors that impact an individual\u2019s health.\u201d Margolis said that the industry is going through a three-stage transformational wave from patient-centered care to consumer engagement to ultimately the science of prevention. \u201cHistorically the healthcare industry has focused on the 15 percent of the population who need sick care. It is now time to also think more about optimizing the health of the other 85 percent of the consumers. That is how we really drive the value in healthcare.\u201d\n\nSharing these views on the changing world of healthcare was Catherine Anderson, national vice president of healthcare policy for United Healthcare Community and State. Anderson said that the industry has entered a period of \u201chealthcare like we\u2019ve never seen it before\u201d driven by \u201cconsumer demands, purchaser demands, expanded provider roles, increased transparency, blurred lines between payers, and new incentives for all involved.\u201d Anderson shared with conference attendees the four emerging policy trends that she believes will drive the market to its new destination: \u201cvalue over volume, consumer centric, population focused and progressive provider engagement.\u201d\n\nOther topics discussed at the two-day conference included the practical realities of ACA implementation, advances in telemedicine, proven strategies for managing seniors and chronic disease, managing acute and post-acute care, clinical integration and narrow networks, and transforming the retail pharmacy to a healthcare provider. A pre-conference workshop focused on developing and managing bundled payments, capitation, and tailored networks.\n\nDalton said that plans are already underway for MDS\u2019 10th Anniversary leadership conference, to be held Oct 4-6, 2015, in Las Vegas.\n\nMDS Consulting is a national healthcare consulting firm that helps hospitals, medical groups, health systems and other healthcare organizations achieve their goals for development, growth and profitability.
