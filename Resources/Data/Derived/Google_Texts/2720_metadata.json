Most recently, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-VA) took advantage of current media hubbub over the Obamacare rollout to doom immigration reform legislation, arguing that the Healthcare.gov website glitches prove any Democrat-backed legislation is flawed.\n\nCantor\u2019s invocation of the Obamacare rollout is just the latest example in a long string of reasons Republicans have seized upon to block immigration reform for a little longer. In fact, though Republicans now say there is no more time to pass a bill this year, lawmakers have been procrastinating on immigration reform for most of Obama\u2019s presidency.\n\nWe can\u2019t pass immigration reform because\u2026\n\nObamacare passed. (March 2010)\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), now considered one of the strongest backers of comprehensive reform, threw a tantrum after the Affordable Care Act was passed in 2010, declaring immigration reform \u201cdead\u201d because the health care bill \u201cpoisoned the well\u201d for any future bipartisan negotiations. \u201cWhen I say immigration\u2019s dead in the Senate, risk-aversion abounds,\u201d he said.\n\nThere\u2019s still a Mexican drug war. (April 2010)\n\nOne month later, as the Obama administration began pushing for an immigration bill, Graham again insisted immigration reform was dead, this time because Mexican drug war violence was not yet solved. As the Hill reported, Graham argued that Congress could not consider any action on immigration before the drug war was addressed, and certainly could not take it up in 2010. \u201cI believe we can do it by 2012 if we\u2019re smart and address the big elephant in the room \u2014 the borders are not secure and there\u2019s a [drug] war going on,\u201d he said.\n\nObama used an executive order to legalize some undocumented youths. (October 2012)\n\nAfter the DREAM Act failed, Obama\u2019s Deferred Action For Childhood Arrivals (DACA) became the latest excuse to postpone immigration reform. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), who recently abandoned the Senate reform bill he himself drafted, accused Obama of \u201cpoison[ing] the well for people willing to take on this issue\u201d.\n\nSequestration forced Homeland Security to release some detainees. (February 2013)\n\nAutomatic budget cuts in March prompted immigration detention centers to release non-violent detainees, enraging Republicans who saw the move as politically rather than financially motivated. Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-VA) immediately blamed the DHS decision for derailing Republican interest in immigration reform, saying it \u201cundermines our efforts to come together with the administration and reform our nation\u2019s immigration laws.\u201d Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL), a strident opponent of reform, also seized the opportunity to scapegoat the Obama administration for \u201cfurther reduc[ing] the chances of reaching a bipartisan immigration accord.\u201d\n\nThe Boston Marathon bomber was an immigrant. (April 2013)\n\nSoon after the Tsarnaev brothers carried out a horrific attack on the Boston Marathon, Republicans demanded a halt to immigration reform. Tea Party lawmakers like Rep. Steve King (R-IA) and Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-TX) asserted that the bombings showed any path to legal status would endanger Americans, and that radical Islamists \u201care trained to act Hispanic.\u201d Even less radical Republican Sen. Dan Coats (R-IN) said reform advocates should put the bill \u201con hold\u201d for \u201ca month or two\u201d because lawmakers were bound to legislate \u201can emotional reaction\u201d to the bombing.\n\nThe Obamacare employer mandate was delayed. (July 2013)\n\nIn July, House Republicans zeroed in on the one-year delay of the Obamacare employer mandate as proof that the administration could not be trusted to enforce the Senate immigration bill\u2019s border security measures. House GOP leadership released a statement confirming they would take no action on the Senate bill, claiming that Americans \u201cdon\u2019t trust a Democratic-controlled Washington.\u201d The statement read, \u201cThe president has also demonstrated he is willing to unilaterally delay or ignore significant portions of laws he himself has signed, raising concerns among Americans that this administration cannot be trusted to deliver on its promises to secure the border and enforce laws as part of a single, massive bill like the one passed by the Senate.\u201d\n\nDebate over Syria intervention was taking too long. (September 2013)\n\nCiting Congressional debate over intervention in Syria\u2019s bloody civil war, Rep. Raul Labrador (R-ID) dismissed any chance of immigration reform getting passed before 2015. \u201cA lot of us thought that the debate was going to be in October, but now, with the problems that we\u2019re having internationally and also here in this country, I don\u2019t see how we\u2019re going to be able to have this debate until November,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I really don\u2019t know if it will be possible to do it in November.\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s refusal to negotiate during the shutdown hurt Republicans\u2019 feelings. (October 2013)\n\nAfter Republicans shut down the government in hopes of defunding or delaying Obamacare, many lawmakers said Obama\u2019s refusal to give in had sabotaged immigration reform for the rest of the year. Labrador took up the line shortly after the shutdown ended, declaring that House Republicans\u2019 negotiation over immigration would be \u201ca very big mistake\u201d because it would let Obama win again. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to destroy the Republican party,\u201d Labrador said. \u201cI think that anything we do right now with this president on immigration will be with that same goal in mind, which is to destroy the Republican party and not to get good policies.\u201d Rubio echoed Labrador a couple days later. \u201cThe president has undermined this effort, absolutely, because of the way he has behaved over the last three weeks,\u201d he said, warning that Republicans whose pride had been hurt would no longer be willing to \u201cget in a room and negotiate a deal with the president on immigration.\u201d Even Rep. Tom Cole (R-OK), a proponent of immigration reform, argued that House Republicans could hardly be expected to pass immigration reform when they were not even capable of keeping the government running. \u201cWe\u2019re not sure we can chew gum, let alone walk and chew gum, so let\u2019s just chew gum for a while,\u201d Cole said.\n\nHealthcare.gov has technical difficulties. (November 2013)\n\nCantor deployed the botched Obamacare rollout to excuse the fact that House leadership has refused to call a floor vote on the Senate bill, even though it would pass with bipartisan support. When pressed by House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-MD), Cantor said, \u201cA bill like Obamacare or a bill like the Senate immigration bill produces the kinds of impact and effect that we\u2019re seeing this week and last week and the prior. We don\u2019t want to commit that same mistake.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Republicans have found new reasons to delay immgiration reform in every news cycle.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Republicans have found new reasons to delay immgiration reform in every news cycle.", "title": "A History Of Republican Excuses For Procrastinating On Immigration Reform", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/immigration/2013/11/19/2965861/republicans-excuses-immigration-reform-delay/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/timenow-e1384893838687.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Republicans have found new reasons to delay immgiration reform in every news cycle.", "creator": "@avivash", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/timenow-e1384893838687-321x214.jpg", "title": "A History Of Republican Excuses For Procrastinating On Immigration Reform", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-immigration", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/timenow-e1384893838687.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/timenow-e1384893838687.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-19T15:46:00+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/avivawshen"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9555\"", "article_summary": "We can\u2019t pass immigration reform because\u2026Obamacare passed.\n(October 2012)After the DREAM Act failed, Obama\u2019s Deferred Action For Childhood Arrivals (DACA) became the latest excuse to postpone immigration reform.\n(April 2010)One month later, as the Obama administration began pushing for an immigration bill, Graham again insisted immigration reform was dead, this time because Mexican drug war violence was not yet solved.\n(September 2013)Citing Congressional debate over intervention in Syria\u2019s bloody civil war, Rep.
