To you, nothing had changed. You were still you, the same height you had always been, though now you could reach the top shelf where before you couldn\u2019t. So what happened? The phenomenon is called change blindness, and it\u2019s at the heart of editor and film director Anthony Cerniello\u2019s new time-lapse video, \u201cDanielle.\u201d\n\nThe video begins with a girl who is no more than 4 years old. In five minutes\u2019 time, the girl ages well into adulthood and goes gray into her 60s or 70s. Even though her entire life happens in front of you, the progression is invisible. The fluidity of Cerniello\u2019s video creates the effect. Tiny, imperceptible changes form a seamless transition from childhood to adulthood. It\u2019s only once you pause the video and jump between frames \u2014 as if leaping between large gaps in time \u2014 that the changes become apparent.\n\nChange blindness isn\u2019t simply an opportunity for nostalgia. The psychological phenomenon can reveal much about how people function in daily life and, according to some research, can reflect deep cultural ideology.\n\nAt the heart of change blindness is the inability to notice small, peripheral changes in your environment. The brain has huge chunks of data consuming its attention at any given moment, so it does its best to focus on what seems important \u2014 usually what can keep it alive or happy. This form of change blindness stems from the brain\u2019s natural inclination to \u201cshine\u201d a light on certain things and ignore others. It\u2019s what makes the Monkey Business Illusion so effective and tests of memory so difficult. More gravely, it\u2019s also a side effect of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and what causes elderly drivers to be more dangerous on the road.\n\nOne 2009 study examined the effects of cognitive and memory decline among the elderly and Alzheimer\u2019s patients in their ability to detect changes in natural scenes, all from the point of view of behind a steering wheel. \u201cPart of the motivation for using pictures of natural scenes in CB experiments is that much of human behavior is situational in context and depends on the level of naturalistic detail presented,\u201d the report states.\n\n\u201cBecause people with normal vision typically can rely on the ability to rapidly and accurately detect environmental changes, they are able to accomplish feats such as keeping track of a person in a crowd, crossing the street in traffic, or driving safely in traffic even at highway speeds,\u201d the researchers wrote, ultimately finding age correlates positively with greater change blindness.\n\n\u201cDespite normal vision, we sometimes fail to notice even very conspicuous changes.\u201d\n\nThese conspicuous changes are so fleeting largely because human vision doesn\u2019t occur in one continuous stream. People see the world in quick, choppy glances called \u201csaccades.\u201d To better understand the process, look at one corner at the top of your screen, then quickly look at the opposite corner. In the time between averting your gaze, you were effectively blind. Even if you were to slowly track your gaze across the top of the screen, guiding your sight the whole way, your visual system would still be operating in short bursts.\n\nResearchers suggest it\u2019s within these thin slices of blindness that the changes are lost. Trying to track Danielle\u2019s aging process in real-time is difficult because, while the eye is a finely tuned receptor, it has its limits. Observing the physical world, wholly, in real-time, would require a visual system that takes no breaks to send information to the brain.\n\nYou may watch Danielle grow from doe-eyed toddler to wizened elder in a matter of minutes, but she never seems to change \u2014 just as you may gaze at yourself in the mirror each morning over the period of decades, growing but never noticing, looking but never seeing.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "anthony cerniello, time lapse, change blindness, old woman, child, danielle, transition", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Anthony Cerniello's \"Danielle\" features a woman seamlessly aging from childhood to old age in a matter of minutes.", "title": "Woman Seamlessly Ages Decades In Under 5 Minutes [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/anthony-cerniello-creates-seamless-time-lapse-womans-entire-life-magic-change-blindness-video-256357", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/11/aging.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Anthony Cerniello's \"Danielle\" features a woman seamlessly aging from childhood to old age in a matter of minutes.", "title": "Woman Seamlessly Ages Decades In Under 5 Minutes [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/anthony-cerniello-creates-seamless-time-lapse-womans-entire-life-magic-change-blindness-video-256357", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/11/aging.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/11/aging.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2013-09-11T11:04:47-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-11T11:04:46-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Anthony Cerniello's \"Danielle\" features a woman seamlessly aging from childhood to old age in a matter of minutes."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9abb\"", "article_summary": "This form of change blindness stems from the brain\u2019s natural inclination to \u201cshine\u201d a light on certain things and ignore others.\nAt the heart of change blindness is the inability to notice small, peripheral changes in your environment.\nChange blindness isn\u2019t simply an opportunity for nostalgia.\nThe phenomenon is called change blindness, and it\u2019s at the heart of editor and film director Anthony Cerniello\u2019s new time-lapse video, \u201cDanielle.\u201dThe video begins with a girl who is no more than 4 years old.\nEven though her entire life happens in front of you, the progression is invisible."}
