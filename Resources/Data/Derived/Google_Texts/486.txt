Black Friday deals can still pull in shoppersâ€”both online and in stores.

The Thanksgiving weekend saw more than 151 million bargain hungry consumers open up their wallets to make purchases either on the Internet or in physical stores, the National Retail Federation said on Sunday. This year, the NRF changed its methodology to reflect changes to shopping and retail trends, which make year over year comparisons difficult.

The NRF's sentiment survey, which are not based on actual retailer's results, said the number of people shopping exceeded their mid-November survey, when the organization estimated 136 million would shop over Thanksgiving weekend.

The NRF's results also underscored the growing power of the Internet. The number of people who shopped online--more than 103 million, according to the organization--edged out the nearly 102 million who opted for in-store deals. The average spending per person over the weekend totaled nearly $300, and most shoppers were under the age of 35.

"It is clear that the age-old holiday tradition of heading out to stores with family and friends is now equally matched in the new tradition of looking online for holiday savings opportunities," ," said NRF President and CEO Matthew Shay.

According to Shay, 42 percent of shoppers that said they shopped online, while nearly 52 percent shopped either in store, online or both. Black Friday spending has evolved because of early sales, he added.
