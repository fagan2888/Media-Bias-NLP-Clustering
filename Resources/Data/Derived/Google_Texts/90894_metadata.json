Throughout the day, users on social media who support the goals of the project complained the external appointment system, powered by Appointment Plus, an Arizona company, was inaccessible and that calls to 311 were not helpful.\n\n\"The @IDNYC rollout is terrifying/hilarious/mindblowing considering the fedgov http://healthcare.gov debacle. How did you not plan for this?,\" was one Twitter comment from Neil Reilly, who works for the Citizens Housing Planning Council.\n\n\"#IDNYC is breaking the Internet. @NYCMayorsOffice, why'd you pull a http://healthcare.gov and not prepare for this? #ServerProblems,\" read a Twitter post from Randy Abreu.\n\nThe cards are available to all New Yorkers, but will be particularly important for undocumented immigrants, homeless and transgender New Yorkers and others who may not qualify for conventional forms of identification.\n\nAt an unrelated press conference Wednesday, de Blasio said he was not concerned when asked about the situation being similar to the launch of healthcare.gov, the health insurance exchange website operated under the Affordable Care Act. \"I don't think I could find a better case of apples and oranges,\" he said. \"The demand we saw on the first day was in the thousands. It wasn't like healthcare.gov, where you had to deal with millions and millions of people.\" Noting the \" high-demand dynamic\" and the continued availability of 17 enrollment locations, de Blasio said the website would be fixed and would be \"back up and running soon.\"\n\nAdministration officials said separately that the city was working to address the reported issues with the booking system and had dispatched extra staff to enrollment centers. More than 4,000 New Yorkers had signed up for cards as of this morning, according to administration officials, and 2,300 appointments had been booked at sites and online as of 2 p.m.\n\nOfficials also said that there were no reports of problems or chaos at sites, and that the overall mood was positive in spite of lines. They added that backend capacity had been increased to prevent delays in sending out cards, and that 311 employees had been training to deal with 311 queries.\n\nThe I.D. cards enable holders to legally identify themselves to police officers and can be used at city buildings, including schools and hospitals, in order to gain access.\n\nIn a brief interview Wednesday, Abreu, a recent law school graduate from the Bronx, said he had been helping his immigrant grandmother and mother, a naturalized citizen from the Dominican Republic, register for the I.D. cards as \"both of them have no experience with computers.\"\n\nTold at the Bronx Library that a new registration procedure would be necessary, Abreu said he tried to register for an appointment at 9 a.m. and ended up calling 311 several times only to be told the servers were down.\n\nHe criticized \"mixed messages\" about the application process.\n\n\"When the people that this system is intended to help are the homeless and immigrants, these are exactly the people that don't have access to the type of technology that 311 is telling us to go use to make an appointment,\" he said. \"This is an example that future administrations should take a look at and realize that you can't just come up with a great idea, it has to be a great idea that's seen through to the end and these ideas need to anticipate technology policy, digital policy.\"\n\nCody Carvel, a researcher and data analyst at a start-up, wrote in an e-mail that \"it's hard to imagine how the city failed to anticipate this level of demand and plan accordingly ... It's probably my technical background that makes this experience most frustrating because I have faith that technology could solve these sorts of logistical challenges ... at present it's a barrier.\"\n\nAnother technologist, Ian Valentine, a customer service representative at Uber, made the suggestion on Twitter to \"add fillable text fields (w/ a fixed-width font) to your PDF application forms. Speeds up the process + reduces errors.\"\n\nNoel Hidalgo, executive director at technology advocacy group BetaNYC, praised several aspects of the initial roll-out, such as the mobile-friendly website, the use of Google Translate and the use of a map with the aim of reaching a wide audience.\n\nBut, he said, the selection of the external appointments site raised questions for him and other members of the community about scalability and the advantages of cloud services. He said he hoped that 311 and the city would release inquiry and usage data about IDNYC, emphasizing that \"you need to be thinking through the technology beyond just the application process. Public interfaces are critical,\" he said.\n\n\"Obviously the city was super successful in its marketing and promotion, it was so successful that it's overwhelming itself,\" he noted, also citing the healthcare.gov example.\n\nHe said BetaNYC hoped to see the city build out an internal digital services team, a process he said was already underway as the city has moved to take greater ownership of software development. \"You can see that there are job postings for internal research and development, internal civic hackers inside of the C.T.O'.s office, the question is if they were in place would they have been able to build something better than the third party vendor?\"\n\nAnother user who experienced difficulties, Gavin Bridge, who works in market research, said \"[the overload] makes it clear that everyone wants it,\" though he noted he did not get any social media feedback to his Twitter query. \"The program itself is pretty awesome. I kind of wish I hadn't signed up for a museum membership two weeks ago... I'm looking forward to being able to sign up.\"\n\n--Gloria Pazmino contributed", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/city-hall/2015/01/8560208/sign-problems-plague-start-municipal-id-program", "image": "http://www.capitalnewyork.com/sites/all/themes/capitalny/images/cap.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Sign-up problems plague start of municipal ID program"}, "robots": "all", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "De Blasio dismisses comparisons to launch of healthcare.gov"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde99d\"", "article_summary": "The city moved to an online appointment system Wednesday to better manage overwhelming demand and lines for the I.D.\nMayor Bill de Blasio dismissed suggestions Wednesday that problems with the new municipal I.D.\nonline appointment system were comparable to the issues that surrounded the launch of healthcare.gov, even though many technologists and frustrated users of the system invoked that exact comparison on social media.\nHow did you not plan for this?,\" was one Twitter comment from Neil Reilly, who works for the Citizens Housing Planning Council.\nThroughout the day, users on social media who support the goals of the project complained the external appointment system, powered by Appointment Plus, an Arizona company, was inaccessible and that calls to 311 were not helpful."}
