Finally I would be doing something professionally that was more in sync with my political values. Instead of using my skills to keep track of pension trust portfolios, I would be creating a data infrastructure for patient care.\n\nFor more than a year I worked on developing a data model based on \u201cnormalized\u201d relationships that sought to eliminate redundancies and provide a reliable foundation for applications development. A few months after I presented the model to management, I learned that all my work was in vain. The hospital had decided to buy a package from SMS, inc. that was considered nonpareil when it came to debt collection. As happened too often, a loved one would check into the hospital for a couple of months of very expensive and painful treatments that came to an end with the patient\u2019s death. Since the survivors often had a tendency to ignore the astronomical bills that went along with such an exercise in futility, the hospital decided to purchase a system that was very good at dunning if nothing else. That decision left me feeling deflated. Once again money ruled.\n\nWhen I received an invitation to review \u201cSecond Opinion: Laetrile at Sloan-Kettering\u201d, a documentary described as \u201cthe remarkable true story of a young science-writer at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, who risked everything by blowing the whistle on a massive cover-up involving a promising cancer therapy\u201d, I knew that this was one I could not miss. (The film opens at Cinema Village in NYC on August 29, and at Laemmle Music Hall in LA on September 5. A national release will follow.)\n\nDirected by Eric Merola, the film is made up primarily of Ralph W. Moss, the aforementioned young science-writer now 71, describing the events that took place when he was working at MSKCC in the mid-70s filled with the same sense of idealism I brought with me 8 years later. Like me, Moss was soon disillusioned but for another set of reasons.\n\nAlthough I wasn\u2019t aware of it at the time, my first encounter with Moss was when I worked at MSKCC, through the intermediary of a book he wrote titled \u201cThe Cancer Industry\u201d. As I noted in a May 2012 article about MSKCC\u2019s purchase of the SMS software, Moss\u2019s book was a good introduction to the slimy realities of cancer care under capitalism:\n\nWhen I was working at Sloan-Kettering, I read a terrific book titled \u201cThe Cancer Industry\u201d that along with \u201cThe Cancer Wars\u201d is essential reading for those with a class analysis. To this day, I remember what the book said about Hubert Humphrey\u2019s stay at Sloan-Kettering. I don\u2019t have the book handy but these paragraphs from a 1990 review should suffice:\n\nAmong the horrors stories in The Cancer Industry is the case history of Senator Hubert Humphrey, who was operated on by a team of surgeons at Memorial Sloan-Kettering on October 6, 1976. His surgeon appeared before the press and television cameras to announce that the senator was cured by the operation, but as a preventive measure, to \u201cwipe out any microscopic colonies of cancer cells that may be hidden in the body, treatment would begin with experimental drugs.\u201d Moss describes the aftermath: \u201cWithin about a year, Senator Humphrey was dead. In that short time he had withered from a vigorous middle-aged man to an old, balding and feeble cancer victim. Humphrey himself blamed chemotherapy \u2026 calling it `bottled death\u2019 and refusing in the end to return to Memorial Hospital for drug treatment.\u201d\n\nHired to work in the PR department for his writing ability and enthusiasm, Moss had an unsettling introduction. On the very week he started, he was shocked to discover that one of the hospital\u2019s top researchers had been caught perpetrating a major fraud. After announcing to the world that he had completed an experiment that successfully transplanted skin from a black mouse to a white mouse, William Summerlin became an MSKCC super-star. Since the mice were of different species and the transplant had not been rejected, this could lead to major breakthroughs in human organ transplants. When a lab assistant discovered quite by accident that Summerlin had simply used a black magic marker to draw a patch on a white mouse\u2019s back, the hospital looked incompetent. Lewis Thomas, the hospital\u2019s director, explained the incident as one caused by Summerlin\u2019s \u201csevere emotional disturbance\u201d. I would have called it greed.\n\n(I should add that Lewis Thomas is not one of my favorite people. He is the author of an essay titled \u201cThe Iks\u201d that makes the case that this hunting and gathering society living in the Ugandan wilderness were \u201can irreversibly disagreeable collection of unattached, brutish creatures, totally selfish and loveless.\u201d Remembering Thomas\u2019s essay from high school, filmmaker Cevin Soling traveled to Ikland to find out for himself whether this was true. Suffice it to say that Thomas\u2019s essay was a bogus as Summerlin\u2019s painted mouse.)\n\nAround the same time, a more serious experiment was taking place at MSKCC. An octogenarian Japanese scientist named Kanematsu Sugiura, who had published 250 papers in a distinguished career, had begun treating mice with laetrile. The substance, also called amygdalin, was extracted from apricot pits. His findings: the mice that received laetrile benefited from injections. They were not cured of cancer but were able to live longer than non-treated animals. Most importantly, the tumors did not metastasize in the treated mice. Trained to be cautious, Sugiura thought the drug had palliative value. The implication, needless to say, was that further research was needed.\n\nAs word of Sugiura\u2019s experiments filtered up to the MSKCC brass, they assigned Moss to cover them from a PR angle but just as much to snoop on the senior researcher. Not only did Moss fail to detect any irregularities, he became upset when he learned that the hospital had become convinced that Sugiura\u2019s experiments were flawed and that research should be abandoned.\n\nConvinced that he needed outside help to make the case for Sugiura\u2019s experiments, Moss hooked up with Science for the People, a radical group that came out of the 1960s student movement. Working with a physician-activist named Alec Pruchnicki and without the knowledge of his superiors, Moss began publishing a newsletter called Second Opinion that was distributed outside of MSKCC just like most agitprop was in pre-Internet days. The newsletter soon became a sounding board for every kind of grievance at the hospital, including working conditions and patient treatment.\n\nWhen the hospital called a press conference to disassociate itself from laetrile, Sugiura said that he stood by the hospital\u2019s decision as well as his own findings. When asked by reporters how he could hold mutually opposed positions, he handled himself gracefully while standing his ground.\n\nIn a fascinating Science magazine article from December 23, 1977, Nicholas Wade\u2014the NY Times reporter whose recent book on genetic inheritance most critics regard as a painted mouse\u2014was loath to get on the anti-laetrile bandwagon despite the newspaper\u2019s strong agreement with the top brass\u2019s dismissal of Sugiura\u2019s findings. Wade quotes Robert Good, the top immunologist at MSKCC: \u201cIf we had published those early positive data, it would have caused all kinds of havoc. The natural processes of science are just not possible in this kind of pressure cooker.\u201d\n\nIn a phone conversation with Ralph Moss shortly after I viewed the film, I was struck by his unwillingness to assume the stance of a pro-laetrile activist even though he was obviously convinced that Sugiura\u2019s experiments were valid. The film is making the case for considering alternatives to costly and often toxic medications that are making big pharma rich. He mentioned Avastin, a drug that generated $2.11 billion in sales in 2011. That, he added, was more than the GDP of many third world countries. The spirit of Science for the People continues in the work of Ralph W. Moss. See this film for a riveting account of the conflicts between corporate power and the public good.\n\nSeveral weeks before I watched \u201cSecond Opinion\u201d, I made a point of reading George Johnson\u2019s recently published \u201cThe Cancer Chronicles\u201d in order to get up to speed on current thinking about the disease. As I mentioned above, when I worked at MSKCC, I read Samuel Epstein\u2019s \u201cThe Politics of Cancer\u201d, a book that ties what was perceived at the time as a cancer epidemic to environmental toxins, especially pesticides. It was very much in the spirit of Barry Commoner\u2019s \u201cThe Closing Circle\u201d and amenable to my Marxist opposition to corporate indifference to our health and safety.\n\nAbout ten years after reading \u201cThe Politics of Cancer\u201d, I read Robert Proctor\u2019s \u201cThe Cancer Wars\u201d that backtracked from Epstein\u2019s findings. Although very much a man of the left, Proctor warned his readers that finding a direct correlation between pollutants and cancer is very difficult.\n\nWith Proctor\u2019s warnings in the back of my mind, I was not completely surprised by Johnson\u2019s treatment of the environmental question. In chapter seven, titled \u201cWhere Cancer Really Comes From\u201d, Johnson amasses some statistics of the sort that pro-industry hacks might repeat. For example, epidemiology studies conclude that cancer cases in the immediate vicinity of Love Canal were no greater than that in the rest of New York State even though there was a spike in birth defects.\n\nIn referring to cancer clusters, such as the supposed breast cancer epidemic in Long Island, Johnson concludes that they are \u201cstatistical illusions\u201d. It is not so much that Johnson denies that there is a connection between cancer and the environment; it is that they are exceedingly difficult to prove.\n\nSince I have like most people on the left become convinced that there is a connection between carcinogens in the water, soil and air and the incidence of cancer, I emailed Johnson with my concerns and referred him to a study of cancer clusters near heavily polluted rivers in China. Showing a grace uncommon to most well-established journalists, Johnson took the trouble to write back:\n\nThanks very much for your email. I appreciate the kind words about my book. I hadn\u2019t seen that particular study and will make a point of reading it. Of course many industrial chemicals are carcinogenic, and it seems very possible that concentrations have been high and chronic enough in China\u2019s water to expose the general population to levels known to cause cancer in the workplace. Nailing that down is very tricky though, especially in developing countries where epidemiological studies are just getting underway. Most of the research in China seems to concentrate on air pollution and lung cancer. Since the focus of my book was on cancer in the developed world, I may write a column in the future comparing the situation with China, India, etc.\n\nMaking the case about pollution\u2014a negative indicator\u2014is difficult but just as much so with positive indicators. Nutritionists are always urging us to eat fruits and vegetables, especially those with anti-oxidant properties such as blueberries and cabbage but there has never been a rigorous study of diet and cancer. This has a lot to do with the near impossibility of conducting a demographically representative study of the effects of eating \u201cgood\u201d food and bad. Since cancer can take many decades to show up, tracking its roots and development is a near impossible task.\n\n\u201cThe Cancer Chronicles\u201d was motivated in part by his wife\u2019s illness. Showing the difficulty of establishing a unilinear connection between diet and the disease, Nancy Johnson was something of a health nut given to daily exercise and a large intake of the very anti-oxidant fruits and vegetables nutritionists advise. Chapter four begins:\n\nShe always ate her vegetables. Obsessively, it sometimes seemed. Breakfast, lunch, dinner, throughout the day she would keep mental count. Never mind if it was 10:30 p.m., halfway through a Simpsons episode or a DVD. If she hadn\u2019t consumed two or three servings of vegetables (some green, some yellow) and three or four servings of fruits, nuts, grains\u2014whatever the food pyramidologists were recommending\u2014she would slice up an apple or open a bag of carrots.\n\nConfronted by the sheer anomaly of a person with such a lifestyle being susceptible to cancer, Johnson sets out on a trek that takes him to conferences and labs all around the USA when he is not accompanying his wife on her frequent chemotherapy sessions. His goal was to understand the basic biology of humanity\u2019s oldest disease.\n\nIndeed, it is not just ours. The dinosaurs suffered from cancer as well. In a trip to western Colorado, Johnson visits the site where six tons of Brontosaurus bones were discovered in 1901, including one that was the oldest one known to have contained a tumor. Using prose that has been polished over a long and distinguished career in science journalism, he reports on what he saw:\n\nViewed head-on, the fossil measured 6.5 by 9.5 inches. Lodged inside its core was an intrusion, now crystallized, that had grown so large it had encroached into the outer bone. Bunge [a museum curator] suspected osteosarcoma\u2014he had seen the damage the cancer can do to human skeletons, particularly those of children. Oval in shape and the size of a slightly squashed softball, the tumor had been converted over the millennia into agate.\n\nJohnson\u2019s book is one of the finest on science that I have read in a very long time, perhaps in my life. As I told Marxmail subscribers, if I had run into such a book when I was in high school, I probably would have majored in biology at Bard College rather than religion (don\u2019t try to get me to explain that choice.)\n\nJohnson\u2019s book ranges from medicine to physics, and from physics to philosophy without missing a beat. At the risk of sounding like one of those people who write the blurbs on book jackets, I would describe \u201cThe Cancer Chronicles\u201d as a powerful examination of the biology of the human cell, including those that mutate into the most dreaded disease we face.\n\nBetween 2008 and 2012, three men died of cancer all within just about two years of each other. The first to go was Peter Camejo, who was responsible for helping me to understand what went wrong with the Socialist Workers Party. Peter, who succumbed to lymphoma, attributed his illness to pollutants he had been exposed to over a lifetime.\n\nNext to go was Harvey Pekar, the comic book author who persuaded me to work on a memoir with him. Peter Camejo was a character in the memoir, as well as number of other colorful characters I got to know over a lifetime in politics and the bohemian underground. Like Peter, Harvey died from lymphoma or at least a system weakened by the disease.\n\nFinally, two years later, I learned of Alexander Cockburn\u2019s death. Alexander was a kind of bookend to Peter. When I quit the Trotskyist movement in 1979, I intended to put politics behind me and return to the bohemia of my youth. In an attempt to keep up with the NYC underground, I began reading the Village Voice. But the only writing that made any kind of impression on me was Alexander Cockburn\u2019s weekly columns that lacerated the high and mighty. It was his writing that moved me to return to politics, the only damned thing I am good at.\n\nThe more our lives become entwined with the Internet, and social media in particular, the closer we become to people even if we never meet in person. Over the past few years, I have been at the virtual bedside of two people who I have enormous respect for. Using Facebook for both support and ventilation, Ed Douglas and Kristin Kolb have kept their friends abreast on their encounters with life-threatening illnesses. Additionally both were able to raise funds through the Internet, a necessity given the lack of adequate health care in the USA. Ed, a founding member of New York Film Critics Online\u2014the group I have been part of for 15 years, developed an acute case of leukemia some years ago that ultimately required a bone marrow transplant. Fortunately he is in remission now and doing well. Kristin, a CounterPunch contributor of great distinction, is going through the final stages of chemotherapy for breast cancer. We who contribute to and read CounterPunch offer our support for her getting past this ordeal.\n\nIf the origins of cancer and its ultimate cure are shrouded in mystery, the same cannot be said about the need for adequate and affordable care. If it were not for the generosity of Ed and Kristin\u2019s friends and admirers, their road would have been a lot more difficult.\n\nMike Marqusee, another long-time CounterPunch contributor, made the wise choice to relocate to Britain in 1971 where health care is free.\n\nAround the time I started reading Johnson\u2019s \u201cThe Cancer Chronicles\u201d, I learned that Marqusee has been dealing with multiple myeloma for a number of years. He wrote a book recently that touches on his illness as well as Britain\u2019s socialized medicine. Available from OR Books, \u201cThe Price of Experience: Writings on Living with Cancer\u201d is both a personal history as well as a sharp-eyed analysis of the benefits of socialized medicine\u2014as one would expect from a long-time Marxist.\n\nYou will notice that just above I refer to Marqusee \u201cdealing\u201d with cancer rather than the hackneyed term \u201cbattling\u201d. As might be expected from an antiwar activist (Marqusee was on the steering committee of the Stop the War Coalition in Britain), Marqusee has little use for military metaphors. He writes:\n\nObituaries routinely inform us that so-and-so has died \u201cafter a brave battle against cancer.\u201d Of course, we will never read that so-and-so has died \u201cafter a pathetically feeble battle against cancer.\u201d But one thing that I have come to appreciate since being diagnosed with multiple myeloma (a cancer of the blood) two years ago is how unreal both notions are. It\u2019s just not like that. The emphasis on cancer patients\u2019 \u201cbravery\u201d and \u201ccourage\u201d implies that if you can\u2019t \u201cconquer\u201d your cancer, there\u2019s something wrong with you, some weakness or flaw. If your cancer progresses rapidly, is it your fault? Does it reflect some failure of will-power?\n\nLike one of the characters in Michael Moore\u2019s \u201cSicko\u201d who lives a country not befouled by big pharma and the insurance industry, Marqusee describes a system that is geared to human need rather than private profit. For all the years he has been receiving treatment at Barts, the nickname for St. Bartholomew\u2019s, a London hospital founded in 1123 (!), he has never had to pay a penny. Despite the fact that it is free, the treatment has been equal to some of the premiere hospitals in the USA.\n\nBut the same forces that have imposed Obamacare on us are conspiring to privatize and/or reduce the level of treatment in Britain. Showing the same sense of worker and patient solidarity that Ralph Moss\u2019s newsletter sought to imbue at MSKCC nearly 40 years ago, Marqusee writes and we conclude:\n\nI hope staff at Barts resist this attack on their jobs, and on the essential, life-sustaining services they provide. It\u2019s often seemed to me that Barts survives on their good will alone. They\u2019ve already been hammered by a steady fall in real wages, and there is a sad fatalism among most, not helped by the patchiness of the union presence across the Trust. What\u2019s vital is that they understand that what\u2019s happening now is not about failings at Barts; it\u2019s a manifestation of the general crisis in the NHS, a crisis brought about by cuts, fragmentation, and privatisation, and one that can only be addressed through a mass movement that forces a radical redirection in government policy.\n\nLouis Proyect blogs at http://louisproyect.org and is the moderator of the Marxism mailing list.
