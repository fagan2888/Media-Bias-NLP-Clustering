According to research published in the February issue of Health Affairs, activated patients are more likely to engage in healthy behavior and use health information, compared to less activated patients.\n\nTo engage patients in their own healthcare, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality recommends hospitals form patient-family advisory councils, improve front-line communication, explain bedside shift reports, and involve the family and patient in discharge planning, FierceHealthcare previously reported.\n\nHospitals also can consider patients' Internet use when deciding how much to involve patients in medical decision-making, given patients who use the Internet more frequently are more likely to embrace patient-centered healthcare efforts and participate in their own care, according to a July study published in the Journal of Medical Internet Research.\n\nFor more:\n\n- here's the announcement\n\n- check out the abstract\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nBoost patient activation to lower costs\n\nTodd Park: Patient engagement will 'vastly' improve healthcare\n\nAHRQ offers evidence-based patient engagement tips\n\n5 steps hospitals can take to promote patient engagement\n\nWhat it takes to make wise healthcare choices", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hospitals should add patient activation to their list of readmission reduction strategies, suggests a new study in the Journal of General Internal Medicine that found patients possessing a high degree of knowledge, skills and confidence in self-managing their care were less likely to return to the hospital within 30 days.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Hospitals should add patient activation to their list of readmission reduction strategies, suggests a new study in the Journal of General Internal Medicine that found patients possessing a high degree of knowledge, skills and confidence in self-managing their care were less likely to return to the hospital within 30 days.", "title": "Patient activation influences readmission rates", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/patient-activation-influences-readmission-rates/2013-10-11", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Journal Of General Internal Medicine,patient activation,Patient Care & Outcomes,patient engagement,self-management", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcba3a\"", "article_summary": "For more:- here's the announcement- check out the abstractRelated Articles:Boost patient activation to lower costsTodd Park: Patient engagement will 'vastly' improve healthcareAHRQ offers evidence-based patient engagement tips5 steps hospitals can take to promote patient engagementWhat it takes to make wise healthcare choices\nThe BMC study builds on previous research showing that patients with high activation levels have better outcomes and lower healthcare costs.\nBoston Medical Center physicians looked at data for 695 patients and concluded that the risk of 30-day readmission was almost twice as high for patients with low activation levels than for their higher-activated counterparts.\nLow-activated patients also had a higher rate of emergency department visits within 30 days of discharge than highly activated patients.\n\"These results reinforce a recent emphasis on targeted patient education during hospitalization,\" lead author Suzanne Mitchell, M.D., a family medicine physician at BMC, said according to an announcement."}
