And the stakes are enormous: Fraud is thought to cost the Medicare program alone up to $90 billion each year.\n\nThe analysis \u2013 from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC), a nonprofit group based at Syracuse University \u2013 shows that federal prosecutors filed a record number of new health care fraud cases in fiscal 2013: 377, or more than one for every day of the year. The U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of Illinois, which covers 38 counties and a population of about 1.2 million, led the way, with a prosecution rate that was more than eight times the national average.\n\n>> Sign up for the AARP Money newsletter\n\nThe federal prosecutor there, U.S. Attorney Stephen Wigginton, told the Associated Press that he was \u201cfrankly surprised\u201d to learn that his office was in the No. 1 spot. But perhaps he shouldn\u2019t have been. Wigginton told AP that, since his appointment in August 2010, he\u2019s placed a special emphasis on fighting health care fraud. Last year, for example, his office indicted more than 30 individuals for allegedly defrauding a Medicaid program that\u2019s meant to keep people out of nursing homes by paying personal assistants to help them with general household activities and personal care.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re very focused and strategic,\u201d Wigginton says.\n\nThe lesson hasn\u2019t been lost on Washington. Attorney General Eric Holder, as I wrote back in November, has created a Medicare Strike Force that\u2019s working hard to fight fraud in nine cities nationwide.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re pleased efforts to crack down on Medicare fraud have been returning results,\u201d said Ariel Gonzalez, director of AARP\u2019s federal health and family advocacy. \u201cWe continue to encourage individuals to take a detailed look at their explanation of benefits and report things of concern.\u201d\n\nLearn more about how to protect yourself at the Fight Health Care Fraud page on the AARP website.\n\nPhoto: JaggedPixels/iStockPhoto\n\n>> Get travel discounts with your AARP Member Advantages.\n\nAlso of Interest\n\nSee the AARP home page for deals, savings tips, trivia and more", "article_metadata": {"page_title": "blog", "twitter": {"description": "Can a single federal prosecutor make much of a difference in the war against health care fraud?
