Peter Roskam (R-Ill.) cautioned against what he described as unchecked power given to the IRS under the healthcare law. He demanded to know how the Obama administration would prevent a \u201cLois Lerner 2.0 situation.\"\n\n\u201cIt seems to me that the IRS is just poised to go swimming in a big pool of money,\u201d Roskam said. \u201cAre these the same IT people that can\u2019t find Lois Lerner\u2019s emails or deal with her hard drives?\u201d\n\nKoskinen was asked if he defended Lerner, to which he replied, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t know her.\"\n\nIt was Slavitt\u2019s first public appearance since the federal government announced last week that HealthCare.gov had been hacked in July. But just one lawmaker, Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.), prodded Slavitt about the security breach.\n\nPrice questioned why insurance company leaders told him they had learned about the hack from media reports. Slavitt disputed the claim, saying he had personally informed a representative from the insurance association about the breach.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Lawmakers question income verification methods on HealthCare.gov.", "description": "Lawmakers question income verification methods on HealthCare.gov.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Sarah Ferris", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Lawmakers question income verification methods on HealthCare.gov.", "title": "IRS chief: 'Whenever we can, we follow the law'", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/217288-irs-official-whenever-we-can-we-follow-the-law", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/irs.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-02T05:09:48-05:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/217288-irs-official-whenever-we-can-we-follow-the-law", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Lawmakers question income verification methods on HealthCare.gov.", "card": "summary", "title": "IRS chief: 'Whenever we can, we follow the law'"}, "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-02T05:09-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/217288-irs-official-whenever-we-can-we-follow-the-law", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2014-09-10T13:53-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Tristan Lejeune", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-10T13:53:11-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-02T05:09:48-05:00"}, "keywords": ",Kevin Brady,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "dcterms.title": "IRS chief: 'Whenever we can, we follow the law'"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1a85\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWhenever we can, we follow the law,\u201d IRS Commissioner John Koskinen told the House Ways and Means subcommittee on health on Wednesday.\nRep.
