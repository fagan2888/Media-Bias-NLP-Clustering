Franklin Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey (R)\n\nAs states across the country are moving to expand Medicaid coverage to additional low-income people under the Affordable Care Act, lawmakers in Arizona want to take the opposite approach.\n\nOn Friday, Gov. Doug Ducey (R) approved a measure that seeks to tighten the state requirements for Medicaid eligibility, ultimately limiting public health insurance to fewer residents. The legislation proposes requiring the program\u2019s recipients to be employed in order to qualify for assistance and kicking them out of the program after they\u2019ve been enrolled for five years.\n\nA nearly identical bill was vetoed last year by former Gov. Jan Brewer (R) \u2014 one of the Republican leaders who bucked her party and embraced Obamacare\u2019s optional Medicaid expansion when she was in office. In 2014, Brewer estimated that a five-year limit on Medicaid benefits would drop nearly 213,000 adults and 253,500 children from the rolls. She said that, since all of those newly uninsured people would end up seeking uncompensated care at hospitals without any insurance to pick up the tab, Arizona\u2019s health care system would be pushed to \u201cthe breaking point.\u201d\n\nDucey\u2019s office, on the other hand, released a statement on Friday saying that the new legislation will \u201censure that we have a responsible Medicaid program that protect taxpayers and provide care to those who need it the most.\u201d\n\nThe federal government, which has the authority to reject state\u2019s proposed changes to their Medicaid programs, likely won\u2019t approve Arizona\u2019s reforms. The U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services typically shoots down work requirements because they put too much of a burden on the low-income people who rely on public benefits, who often need Medicaid coverage precisely because they are unemployed. Similar GOP-sponsored proposals have been rejected in Pennsylvania and Utah.\n\nNonetheless, Arizona lawmakers are prepared to keep trying: The measure that Ducey approved stipulates that Arizona will ask permission to impose these Medicaid reforms every single year for the foreseeable future.\n\nOver the past several years, other governors in states like Maine, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin have also moved to cut people from their Medicaid rolls. Many of the people in those states who lost access to public coverage are now eligible for tax subsidies to buy private plans on Obamacare\u2019s marketplaces \u2014 except in Maine, where about 10,000 childless adults lost access to affordable health care altogether.\n\nThanks to the GOP-controlled states that continue to resist Medicaid expansion, Obamacare implementation has been uneven across the country. An estimated four million low-income Americans fall into a coverage gap where they\u2019re unable to access subsidized insurance under Obamacare, keeping the national uninsurance rate at least two percentage points higher than it would be otherwise.\n\nRepublican governors typically say that it\u2019s simply too expensive to provide public insurance to additional low-income people. But some of them also make arguments along the same lines as Ducey, suggesting that Medicaid coverage should be limited to \u201cresponsible\u201d people because too many Americans are abusing the system. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R) once said that denying Medicaid coverage to low-income people helps them \u201clive the American Dream\u201d because they won\u2019t be \u201cdependent on the American government.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "The state wants to put a five-year limit on the program and add a work requirement.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "The state wants to put a five-year limit on the program and add a work requirement.", "title": "Arizona Governor Calls Plan To Kick 500,000 Low-Income People Off Of Medicaid \u2018Responsible\u2019", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2015/03/09/3631297/arizona-medicaid-reforms/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/AP73447500367.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The state wants to put a five-year limit on the program and add a work requirement.", "title": "Arizona Governor Calls Plan To Kick 500,000 Low-Income People Off Of Medicaid \u2018Responsible\u2019", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/AP73447500367-321x214.jpg", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/AP73447500367.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/AP73447500367.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-09T11:35:47+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf18e\"", "article_summary": "Health Arizona Governor Calls Plan To Kick 500,000 Low-Income People Off Of Medicaid \u2018Responsible\u2019 CREDIT: AP Photo/Ross D.
