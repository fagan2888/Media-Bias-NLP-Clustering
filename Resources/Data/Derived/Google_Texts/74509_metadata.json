Brown Road.\n\n\u201cCompleat\u201d is a parody designed to make audiences laugh, not pass an exam. I haven\u2019t seen it or read it, but I\u2019m guessing it has such deconstructions of, say, Hamlet, that read like, \u201cQuestion: Be?\u201d\n\nNonetheless, distillations of the real thing have long become more commonplace in our sorry-gotta-run society. (It\u2019s certain, for example, that many of you are bailing on this column right now, just to prove my point. Thanks!)\n\nThinking about how far this truly has gone, I searched the Internet for what comes up under \u201cWar and Peace in one sentence.\u201d And several attempts to summarize \u2014 with the use of only one period \u2014 the traditionally designated longest novel ever written actually came up. Here\u2019s one from achangeinthewind.com, which quoted the summary of a man named Gary Shtenygart:\n\n\u201cI looked up War and Peace and it\u2019s about this guy Pierre who fights in France, and all this terrible stuff happens to him, but in the end because of his charm he gets to be with this girl he really loves, and who really loves him even though she cheated on him.\u201d\n\nAnd there, dear readers, is what just saved you from an entire semester of Russian literature.\n\nDon\u2019t have time to read the above quote about Leo Tolstoy\u2019s masterpiece all the way to the end? Here\u2019s an even shorter summary from sidewaysstation.com:\n\n\u201cLook, listen, love \u2013 and try not to get run over by history.\u201d\n\nAnd somebody named augie6_1 once answered a request on answers.yahoo.com to tackle Shakespeare\u2019s Romeo and Juliet with an equivalent economy of words:\n\n\u201cArguably the most famous love story of all time, this play tells the tale of a boy and a girl from warring families who meet and fall in love. Fate is not on their side, however, and they eventually choose to kill themselves rather than live without each other.\u201d\n\nAll right, that was two sentences. Well, you try doing it, if you think it\u2019s so easy.\n\nI suppose the reason why there aren\u2019t more one-sentence summations of hefty works of literature \u2014 or even of lighter reading such as the original Obamacare bill \u2014 is that it\u2019s tough slogging. First of all, you have to be the one \u2014 maybe the only one \u2014 who first has to read the original work all the way to the end.\n\nAnd summaries, by their very nature, leave things out that some might find to be important.\n\nAttend a public meeting sometime, then wait until the official minutes of it are published.\n\nI remember covering such meetings, writing a story that included the most pithy or most stinging comments that were made about the big item on that evening\u2019s agenda, only to find the official account ended up reading something like, \u201cAfter discussion and public comment from 172 people, the council approved the proposal.\u201d\n\nAccurate, yes, but even that sentence was too long for many of us.\n\nWe could all use more summaries. Yes, the miracle of downloading means we can watch all 92 episodes of those cable dramas everyone talked about at work but we never caught the first time. But why anyone really has the time to see them all bunched together if he never found just one hour at a time to do it mystifies me. The answer is summaries, just enough to get us through those water-cooler conversations.\n\nPerhaps Shakespeare himself had the foresight to predict that most of us might appreciate a summary of his works, for as one of the characters in Hamlet said:\n\n\u201cBrevity is the soul of wit.\u201d\n\n(As a public service this column is approximately 50 words shorter than usual. OK, I\u2019ll try harder next time.)", "article_metadata": {"description": "Long before the 20-second sound bite was even a gleam in CNN founder Ted Turner\u2019s eye, Cliff Hillegass began serving the needs of the impatient, the overwhelmed, the confused, or just in a hurry among us all.", "og": {"site_name": "East Valley Tribune", "description": "Long before the 20-second sound bite was even a gleam in CNN founder Ted Turner\u2019s eye, Cliff Hillegass began serving the needs of the impatient, the overwhelmed, the confused, or just in a hurry among us all.", "title": "Scarp: This column in one sentence: \u2018Worth remembering, maybe\u2019", "url": "http://www.eastvalleytribune.com/columns/east_valley_voices/article_99ed7bba-3866-11e3-b8c1-001a4bcf887a.html", "image": {"width": 620, "identifier": "http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/eastvalleytribune.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/5/e1/5e1fccee-3a6b-11e3-9d55-0019bb2963f4/526552ef453f7.preview-620.jpg?resize=620%2C300", "height": 300}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@evtnow", "card": "summary", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"admins": "100001414653607,100006692256060,1527006887", "app_id": 148566918492476}, "keywords": "william shakespeare,punctuation,quotation mark,hamlet,cliff hillegass,shakespeare,ted turner,cnn,cliffsnotes,leo tolstoy,nebraska,lincoln,wllm shkspr,pierre,war and peace,gary shtenygart,france,romeo and juliet,tackle,arts,perhaps shakespeare,east_valley_voices,local,apache_junction,chandler,gilbert,mesa,queen_creek,tempe,columnists,opinion,spotlight,top_story", "news_keywords": "william shakespeare,punctuation,quotation mark,hamlet,cliff hillegass,shakespeare,ted turner,cnn,cliffsnotes,leo tolstoy,nebraska,lincoln,wllm shkspr,pierre,war and peace,gary shtenygart,france,romeo and juliet,tackle,arts,perhaps shakespeare,east_valley_voices,local,apache_junction,chandler,gilbert,mesa,queen_creek,tempe,columnists,opinion,spotlight,top_story"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf51c\"", "article_summary": "(It\u2019s certain, for example, that many of you are bailing on this column right now, just to prove my point.\nDon\u2019t have time to read the above quote about Leo Tolstoy\u2019s masterpiece all the way to the end?\nFirst of all, you have to be the one \u2014 maybe the only one \u2014 who first has to read the original work all the way to the end.\nMesa Encore Theatre is presenting \u201cThe Compleat Wrks of Wllm Shkspr (Abridged)\u201d through Nov. 3 at the Black Box on Brown, 318 E.
