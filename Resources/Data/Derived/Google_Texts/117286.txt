Conservative commentator and former presidential candidate Pat Buchanan said on The McLaughlin Group last Saturday that there is a “deeply libertarian trend” across the American political spectrum. Buchanan made the comment after being asked if “the era of pot prohibition is coming to an end.”

Buchanan is not a fan of the legalization of recreational marijuana in Colorado and Washington, saying that the end of pot prohibition in the U.S. will lead to “more high school dropouts and more automobile accidents involving marijuana.”

From The Daily Caller:

Conservative commentator Pat Buchanan called the legalization of recreational marijuana in Colorado and Washington part of a “deeply libertarian trend” sweeping through both sides of the American political spectrum. Buchanan discussed legalization with John McLaughlin during Saturday’s “The McLaughlin Group,” with McLaughlin asking whether “the era of pot prohibition is coming to an end.”
