Hearings have exposed how the abortion company likely violated federal laws to sell the body parts.\n\nThe House plans to vote for the Senate-passed de-funding legislation on January 6 after Congress returns from its Christmas break. Once it approves the bill, Speaker Paul Ryan will sign it and send it to pro-abortion President Barack Obama, who is expected to veto the legislation. The vote would come days before Obama\u2019s expected State of the Union address and Obama has 10 days to sign or veto the bill, which he\u2019s already threatened to do.\n\nFollowing Obama\u2019s veto, House Republican leaders announced they will push for a veto override vote on January 26th. That vote would come just days after more than half a million Americans are expected to march for life in the nation\u2019s capital and solemnly mark the anniversary of Roe v. Wade, which has resulted in the deaths of 57 million unborn babies since 1973.\n\nBoth the House and Senate would need a two-third vote (67%) to override Obama\u2019s expected veto. The House passed the bill in October on a 55% vote margin with virtually every Democrat voting against it.\n\nSIGN THE PETITION! Congress Must De-Fund Planned Parenthood Immediately\n\nLeading pro-life groups say the passage of the Planned Parenthood de-funding bill and the subsequent veto and override votes sets up the pro-life movement for the 2016 elections \u2014 where pro-life voters will need to defeat pro-abortion Hillary Clinton and elect a pro-life president if they want the nation\u2019s biggest abortion business de-funded in 2017.\n\n\u201cAs we learned from the reconciliation fight to defund Planned Parenthood, we CAN advance pro-life legislation through the Senate\u2026 but the veto pen of a pro-abortion president remains our biggest road block,\u201d Susan B. Anthony List spokeswoman Jill Stanek says. \u201cOnly when we elect a pro-life president (and retain our pro-life majorities in Congress), can we get a bill defunding Planned Parenthood signed into law.\u201d\n\n\u201cPresident Obama is likely to veto the recent reconciliation bill defunding Planned Parenthood as soon as it gets to his desk,\u201d Stanek said. \u201cHillary Clinton would be no different, which is why we must work to advance pro-life candidates and ensure a pro-life candidate wins the White House. Planned Parenthood and other allies of pro-abortion Democrats will be throwing in millions of dollars to protect the status quo of abortion on demand up until birth \u2013 at taxpayer expense! \u2013 and we must not let them win.\u201d\n\nThe bill would block, for one year, most federal payments to Planned Parenthood. At least 89% of federal funding of Planned Parenthood would be blocked by this bill. The bill would repeal a number of major components of the Obamacare health law, including two of the major provisions that will lead to rationing of lifesaving care \u2014 the \u201cIndependent Payment Advisory Board\u201d and the \u201cexcess benefits tax.\u201d\n\nObama is threatening to veto the de-funding measure and the threat comes after President Barack Obama warned pro-life people not to \u201cdemonize\u201d Planned Parenthood in the wake of the shooting.\n\nObama has repeatedly threatened to veto any bill that stops taxpayer funding of Planned Parenthood, issuing a veto threat in September and in July.\n\nIn August, Senate Democrats defeated an effort to revoke taxpayer funding for the Planned Parenthood abortion business by filibustering the bill and preventing a vote on it. Republicans were unable to secure the 60 voted needed to invoke cloture and stop debate on the bill, allowing an up or down vote. Republicans could only get 53 votes to shut off debate.\n\nThen, in September, Senate Democrats voted to defeat a government funding bill that would de-fund the Planned Parenthood abortion business after it was caught in a series of 10 videos selling aborted babies and their body parts. The Senate voted 52 to 47 against ending debate.\n\nDozens of leading pro-life groups have already indicated their support for the bill, including the National Right to Life Committee. In a letter to members of Congress that NRLC provided to LifeNews.com, the group indicated it strongly supports the bill to de-fund Planned Parenthood.\n\n\u201cNRLC strongly supports the language in the bill that would block, for one year, most federal payments to affiliates of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA). It would close the largest pipeline for federal funding of Planned Parenthood, Medicaid, and apply as well to the CHIP and the Title V and Title XX block grant programs, thus covering roughly 89% of all federal funds to Planned Parenthood. The amounts denied to Planned Parenthood in effect are reallocated to community health centers,\u201d the pro-life group explained.\n\n\u201cOver one-third of all abortions in the U.S. are performed at PPFA-affiliated facilities. Longstanding objections to the massive federal funding of PPFA have been reinforced by recent widely publicized undercover videos, which illuminate the callous brutality that occurs daily in these abortion mills,\u201d NRLC added.\n\nThe reconciliation bill also repeals portions of Obamacare,including its rationing components. With regard to the rationing aspects of Obamacare, NRLC strongly supports a repeal.\n\n\u201cIn addition, NRLC has always opposed the Obamacare law and advocated its repeal. With respect to H.R. 3762, we particularly endorse the components that would repeal the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) and the \u201cexcess benefits tax\u201d (\u201cCadillac Tax\u201d), both dangerous mechanisms that would ultimately contribute to the rationing of lifesaving care,\u201d the right to life group said.\n\nLeading pro-life groups that also support the reconciliation bill to de-fund Planned Parenthood include Susan B. Anthony List, National Right to Life, Family Research Council, March for Life, Concerned Women for America, Students for Life, Priests for Life, Operation Rescue, and American Life League, among others.\n\nA new Congressional report finds that de-funding the Planned Parenthood abortion business \u2014 even for one year \u2014 would save \u201cseveral thousand\u201d unborn babies from the nightmare of abortion. The report also finds de-funding Planned Parenthood would save the federal government $235 million.\n\nThe expose\u2019 videos catching Planned Parenthood officials selling the body parts of aborted babies have shocked the nation. Here is a list of all eleven:\n\nIn the first video : Dr. Deborah Nucatola of Planned Parenthood commented on baby-crushing: \u201cWe\u2019ve been very good at getting heart, lung, liver, because we know that, so I\u2019m not gonna crush that part, I\u2019m gonna basically crush below, I\u2019m gonna crush above, and I\u2019m gonna see if I can get it all intact.\u201d\n\n: Dr. Deborah Nucatola of Planned Parenthood commented on baby-crushing: \u201cWe\u2019ve been very good at getting heart, lung, liver, because we know that, so I\u2019m not gonna crush that part, I\u2019m gonna basically crush below, I\u2019m gonna crush above, and I\u2019m gonna see if I can get it all intact.\u201d In the second video: Planned Parenthood\u2019s Dr. Mary Gatter joked, \u201cI want a Lamborghini\u201d as she negotiated the best price for baby parts.\n\nPlanned Parenthood\u2019s Dr. Mary Gatter joked, \u201cI want a Lamborghini\u201d as she negotiated the best price for baby parts.

Congress Must Investigate Planned Parenthood for Selling Aborted Baby Parts\n\nThe full, unedited videos have confirmed that revelations that some aborted baby remains sold by Planned Parenthood go to biotech companies for the purpose of creating \u201chumanized\u201d mice. Meanwhile, Planned Parenthood has been exposed as having sold body parts from aborted babies for as much as 15 years.\n\nThe federal law that technically prohibits the sale of aborted babies and their body parts was written by a pro-abortion Congressman decades ago and essentially spells out a process by which sellers of aborted baby body parts can meet certain criteria that allows the sales to be legal.
