The Feb. 25 debate, hosted by CNN, was commandeered by Telemundo celebrity journalist Mar\u00eda Celeste Arrar\u00e1s, known as \u201cthe Katie Couric of Spanish TV,\u201d who soaked up nearly half the show representing \u201cthe Latino community\u201d on issues such as Puerto Rico\u2019s bankruptcy.\n\nIt shouldn\u2019t have been a surprise to the RNC. She did the same during a Democratic presidential debate in 2004, when she argued with candidates about driver\u2019s licenses for immigrants here illegally.\n\nThe lone conservative token questioner, Salem Radio Network talk show host Hugh Hewitt, received a fraction of the time. The infamous \u201cscreaming lady\u201d in the audience earned far more buzz.\n\nHewitt had made an earlier appearance in the second debate, hosted by CNN last September, but again, he was relegated to the margins.\n\nAs even the left-wing New York Times pointed out, the network \u201ccame to the second Republican primary debate looking for a fight\u201d along with an agenda of setting up \u201ccatfights\u201d between Donald Trump and the rest of the candidates.\n\nConservative blogger Scott Johnson of Power Line noted that instead of giving GOP voters \u201ca chance to assess the strengths of the candidates and to pick the strongest candidate to achieve their objective ... (CNN moderator) Jake Tapper had other ideas in mind. His consignment of Hugh Hewitt to the witness protection program is representative of his pursuit of other ideas.\u201d\n\nThe third debate, airing on CNBC from Boulder, Colo., was deemed a complete disaster by observers across the political spectrum.\n\nInstead of focusing on economics, as the network and RNC promised they would, the \u201cmoderators\u201d made themselves the center of attention with trivial and condescending questions designed to instigate circus conflict between personalities instead of enlightening viewers about actual policy differences between candidates.\n\nAgain, this shouldn\u2019t have been a surprise to the RNC. CNBC chief clown John Harwood had a long public record running interference for Hillary Clinton, denigrating conservative critics of Obamacare and shrugging at convicted infant murderer and abortionist Kermit Gosnell.\n\nAs for giving actual conservatives a central chance to address the candidates directly, the RNC yielded to Google during the seventh debate in Iowa in January.\n\nWe didn\u2019t hear from grassroots voters who had their health insurance canceled because of Obamacare or business owners negatively affected by Dodd-Frank or victims of illegal alien crime who oppose amnesty.\n\nInstead, the privileged questioners included a YouTube fashionista who had crossed the border illegally from Mexico as a child and a Muslim activist who spread debunked, CAIR-style propaganda about \u201cIslamophobia\u201d hate crimes in America.\n\nThe ninth debate hosted by CBS in South Carolina was moderated by John Dickerson, a Beltway liberal elite who called on Obama to \u201cGo for the Throat!\u201d and \u201cdeclare war on the Republican Party,\u201d and to \u201cpulverize\u201d his political enemies over gun control, climate change and immigration.\n\nThe event was remarkable not so much for any overt political bias as it was for a complete lack of control over both the candidates and the audience.\n\nAnd, of course, no one remembers anything about the first debate other than the feud between Trump and Fox News Channel anchor Megyn Kelly.\n\nThe obvious, effective solution is to wrest control from mainstream media networks and hold debates sponsored by conservative media outlets with conservative journalists and broadcast/simulcast on neutral ground (hello, C-SPAN!).\n\nThe RNC had one such debate in the works, but abandoned the idea last month. For the candidates, continuing with these rigged charades is an exercise in futility and masochism. For the RNC, it\u2019s suicide.\n\nBy its passivity and complicity, the current batch of GOP enablers have proved that they don\u2019t deserve to be in the driver\u2019s seat.\n\n\u2014 Michelle Malkin is author of Culture of Corruption: Obama and his Team of Tax Cheats, Crooks & Cronies.
