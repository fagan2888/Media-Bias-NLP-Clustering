Is it fiscally conservative to have a trillion-dollar expenditure? We\u2019re not talking about giving people back their tax money. He\u2019s talking about giving people money they didn\u2019t pay. It\u2019s a welfare transfer payment. \u201cSo here\u2019s what we have. Is it conservative to have $1 trillion in transfer payments \u2013 a new welfare program that\u2019s a refundable tax credit? Add that to Marco\u2019s plan for $1 trillion in new military spending, and you get something that looks, to me, not very conservative.\u201d\n\nRubio responded by talking about his belief that \u201cthe family is the most important institution in society\u201d and how he wants \u201cthe strongest military power in the world.\u201d Rand Paul warned of U.S. \u201cbankruptcy.\u201d Both pugilists received some applause.\n\nConsidering the dispute in a broader context, a casual viewer might have seen this as an argument between a Republican touting a progressive idea \u2013 helping parents afford child care \u2013 and another Republican raising fiscal concerns and ideological questions about the creation of a government \u201centitlement.\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019s an angle that went completely overlooked.\n\nRubio\u2019s proposal won\u2019t work. Andrea Flynn recently had a good piece in The Atlantic explaining why the Florida senator\u2019s plan \u201cwould do little to bring forth the changes he promises and Americans want to see.\u201d\n\nHistory tells us that tax credits do not incentivize companies to do right by their employees. As The New York Times reported, tax breaks meant to encourage companies to provide childcare and hire veterans or people with disabilities have largely been ineffective. Indeed, since 1981 the federal government has offered a tax credit for companies that provide on-site childcare, but today only 7 percent of employers offer that benefit. [\u2026] The United States\u2019 lack of paid family leave exacerbates and is exacerbated by the lack other benefits such as paid sick leave, affordable childcare, comprehensive health coverage, and equal pay. But Rubio and many of his colleagues aren\u2019t proposing solutions to those problems either. They are opposed to mandating paid sick leave and equal pay and to raising the minimum wage. They want to overturn the Affordable Care Act and are tireless in their efforts to curtail reproductive health access. And they aren\u2019t likely to make affordable childcare and universal early childhood education part of their \u201cpro-family\u201d campaigns.\n\nAs this relates to last night, it\u2019s the key detail that went unmentioned.
