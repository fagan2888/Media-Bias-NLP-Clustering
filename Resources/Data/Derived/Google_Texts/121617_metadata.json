Instead, Medicaid faces possible retrenchment after a Republican tide swept emboldened Obamacare foes into every level of government.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nArizona and Arkansas, for instance, seemed like the top trophies in the expansion push. But the governors who embraced that part of Obamacare are gone, and hundreds of thousands of people could be stripped of their coverage if their successors don\u2019t show the same zeal to defend it.\n\nAnd the handful of Republican governors who are eyeing some form of expansion face roadblocks. For instance, Mike Pence of Indiana, a potential 2016 presidential contender, is attaching conservative policy elements unacceptable to the Obama administration. His potential 2016 rival John Kasich did expand Medicaid in Ohio but now must whip Republican support to keep it going. The governors of Tennessee, Utah and Wyoming all released proposals, as promised, after the elections. But so far in the two Western states, legislators are balking at taking on any part of Obamacare, even if the feds pick up the tab.\n\nThe architects of the Affordable Care Act intended for every state to expand Medicaid up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level, less than $32,000 for a family of four. But the Supreme Court in 2012 made the expansion optional as it upheld the rest of the health law.\n\nIn the 27 states (and District of Columbia) that have chosen to expand in some form, broader Medicaid coverage has proved to be a fast way of achieving the law\u2019s central goal of insuring more Americans. In 2014, the Urban Institute found the uninsured rate dropped 36 percent in expansion states, versus 24 percent in the holdouts.\n\nThe possible backward movement on Medicaid comes amid uncertainty over the law\u2019s other primary tool for reducing the uninsured: marketplace subsidies. The Supreme Court will decide, probably in June, whether the financial assistance is legal in the 37 states using the federal exchange on HealthCare.gov.\n\nJust a few months ago, advocates anticipated that a new wave of pro-expansion gubernatorial candidates, like Democrats Charlie Crist in Florida and Mike Michaud in Maine, would bring new momentum and electoral mandates to the debate. They expected some new GOP governors to be more open to Medicaid, too.\n\nInstead, ascendant Republicans \u2014 many driven into office on anti-Obamacare planks \u2014 remain as hostile as ever. And their states still have the bizarre coverage gaps created by the Supreme Court ruling. Many of the poorest Americans have no coverage, while people who are just above the poverty line are getting subsidized through the health insurance exchanges.\n\nAdvocates of expansion have touted possible economic benefits for the states, predicting job gains through more demand for health services and hospital solvency. A study by Missouri state officials, for example, found that health-sector jobs grew three times as much in states that expanded than in those that did not. But a December report by the nonpartisan Altarum Institute cast doubt on whether that job growth had anything to do with Medicaid.\n\n\u201cLots of these states are looking at the numbers and saying, no, they have not produced the jobs, they have not produced the economic growth that everybody thought they would,\u201d said Dennis Smith, CMS\u2019 top Medicaid official in the George W. Bush administration.\n\nIn Arizona, Republican Gov. Jan Brewer twisted arms to pass Medicaid expansion, leaving conservatives seething and suing. Tea party-aligned legislators argued that Brewer needed a supermajority to pass the expansion financing and a state court gave the case the green light to go ahead a few weeks ago. Brewer attended a recent hearing in person, but her successor, Republican Doug Ducey, has been conspicuously silent about whether he\u2019ll defend the state\u2019s position.\n\nArkansas saw the sharpest decrease in its uninsured rate in the country after Democratic Gov. Mike Beebe worked with statehouse Republicans and the federal government to craft an innovative alternative approach. The so-called private option, which uses the federal Medicaid expansion funds to buy private plans on the Obamacare marketplace, was seen as a model for other conservative states looking for an ideologically palatable way to move ahead.\n\nBut the plan barely squeaked through the Arkansas Legislature in 2013, and voters fired many of its supporters in November. GAO figures show the program coming in over budget, and it\u2019s hard to see right now how supporters can muster the three-fourths majorities they need in both chambers to continue the program, as required by the Arkansas constitution.\n\n\u201cThe people basically said, \u2018We don\u2019t want the private option anymore,\u2019\u201d said Republican state Rep. Joe Farrer, analyzing the election results. \u201cI don\u2019t think it will be in the current form it is now.\u201d\n\nFoes are crafting a plan to freeze enrollment as both sides wait for Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson to weigh in. He\u2019s promised to do so in a major address slated for Jan. 22.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a high, high hurdle to reach,\u201d said Jodiane Tritt, vice president of government relations for the Arkansas Hospital Association. The hospitals say the additional coverage is reducing losses from patients who can\u2019t pay their bills \u2014 and softening the blow of other ACA-related funding cuts.\n\nThere are people who strongly believe they were sent here to kill Obamacare.\"\n\n\u201cThere are people who strongly believe they were sent here to kill Obamacare,\u201d Tritt said, describing the \u201cPR challenge of fully explaining the difference between the private option and Obamacare itself.\u201d\n\nIn Ohio, Kasich keeps trying to draw a distinction between Obamacare and Medicaid expansion \u2014 even though Medicaid is part of the health care law. He has said he doesn\u2019t \u201csee expanding Medicaid as really connected to Obamacare.\u201d Kasich has lots of political capital after winning reelection with 64 percent of the vote. But he\u2019ll have to spend a significant portion of it persuading his fellow Republicans in the statehouse to renew expansion after he bypassed them last year to enact it temporarily. The new House speaker, Cliff Rosenberger, is a vocal opponent.\n\nIf Kasich does choose to run for president, he could face Pence, his western neighbor, in a GOP primary, and Medicaid could be one thing that sets them apart.\n\nWhile Kasich stuck with traditional Medicaid, Pence asked the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to approve the \u201cHealthy Indiana Plan 2.0\u201d in July, but the agency has yet to issue an opinion. He wants to charge premiums for people below the poverty line and kick people off Medicaid for months if they don\u2019t pay, two measures that may make the feds balk.\n\nIf Pence can win approval, he\u2019ll be able to make the case to primary voters that he found a conservative alternative to Washington. But he\u2019s already faced criticism from his right flank for considering any sort of expansion of a government program, so there\u2019s little motivation for him to concede anything else to the feds.\n\n\u201cWe continue to be willing to compromise, but we will not compromise the principles of the Healthy Indiana Plan,\u201d said Pence spokeswoman Christy Denault, including \u201cpersonal responsibility and accountability.\u201d\n\nUtah Gov. Gary Herbert is having similar challenges in his effort to include work requirements as a condition for making able-bodied adults eligible for expanded Medicaid. CMS rejected that in preliminary negotiations, and Herbert presented the plan to state lawmakers anyway. But a legislative panel refused to endorse it, instead backing a vastly pared-down version. Now Herbert\u2019s back to pressing for a work requirement, bringing it up with both President Barack Obama and Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell last week. That\u2019s a tall order, given that Medicaid has never been linked to work status.\n\nThe process of getting a waiver approved by federal Medicaid authorities is \u201calways slower than we\u2019d like, and states would like more flexibility,\u201d said National Governors Association Executive Director Dan Crippen, a former Reagan administration official. \u201cThe more flexibility they can show, the better off we all will be.\u201d\n\nWinning the waiver is hardly the end of the story in most states. Governors have to persuade legislators to join their leap of faith in the federal government, which is supposed to pay for all of Medicaid expansion the first three years before gradually phasing down to 90 percent for the long run. A lot of Republicans are skeptical about that commitment. \u201cObviously, it\u2019s hard to prove to the Legislature that someday, somehow, the federal match won\u2019t go down,\u201d Crippen said.\n\nIn Tennessee, Gov. Bill Haslam may have figured out a way to squelch concerns about a revenue crunch. The state\u2019s hospitals have agreed to foot the bill as the federal payments scale down. Haslam\u2019s alternative plan \u201cgenerally seems to be in line with recent CMS approvals,\u201d wrote Joan Alker of Georgetown\u2019s Center for Children and Families after he released details last week.\n\nWith a special session devoted to Medicaid scheduled for February, Tennessee is one of the few states where the momentum favors expansion. There are other rumblings: Alaska\u2019s new independent governor has appointed an official specifically to investigate Medicaid expansion, and Idaho Gov. Butch Otter has called for legislative hearings on an expansion proposal. In North Carolina, Republican Gov. Pat McCrory has said he\u2019s looking at other states\u2019 waiver applications for inspiration.\n\nElsewhere, efforts have stalled. In Wyoming, Gov. Matt Mead worked out a preliminary deal with CMS, but a legislative committee voted to go with a plan more like Indiana\u2019s. Montana\u2019s Democratic governor released a proposal, but statehouse Republicans turned up their noses. Lawmakers just worked out a compromise that may let them move ahead.\n\nEven New Hampshire\u2019s expansion faces some rollback efforts, though that\u2019s more of a long shot. Right now, the state\u2019s expansion lasts only through 2016, and the midterms put Republicans in charge of both houses of the state Legislature, although the governor is a pro-ACA Democrat.\n\nAdvocates are betting that politicians\u2019 reluctance to rescind benefits that people are already getting will protect the coverage, and they point out that states were slow to adopt the original Medicaid program in the mid-1960s. But some acknowledge they had expected more states to have adopted it by now.\n\n\u201cExperience told us that we are not going to achieve 100 percent of the states coming in overnight. It\u2019s going to take a while,\u201d said Ron Pollack of Families USA, which supports Obamacare. Still, he added, he would have expected the list at this point to be longer \u2014 and not in danger of getting smaller.\n\nRachana Pradhan contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion is under renewed assault in the states.", "title": "Medicaid expansion may contract", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/01/medicaid-expansion-contract-114235.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/01/13/150113_medicaid_hospital_ap_629.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Obamacare,Health Care,Medicaid", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion is under renewed assault in the states.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "POLITICO Pro Medicaid expansion may contract After the midterms, there is a renewed assault in some states.\nThere are other rumblings: Alaska\u2019s new independent governor has appointed an official specifically to investigate Medicaid expansion, and Idaho Gov.\nJan Brewer twisted arms to pass Medicaid expansion, leaving conservatives seething and suing.\nIn 2014, the Urban Institute found the uninsured rate dropped 36 percent in expansion states, versus 24 percent in the holdouts.\nObamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion is under renewed assault in the states even as the health law faces threats in Washington from the Supreme Court and a Republican Congress."}
