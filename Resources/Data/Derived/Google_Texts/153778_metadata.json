While there are currently drugs to treat the disease, including methotrexate, they sometimes don\u2019t work. Now, a new study finds that a Chinese herbal remedy may be able to treat people with RA more effectively.\n\nOriginating in ancient China, traditional Chinese medicine has been implemented in many parts of the world for thousands of years. It includes various practices of well-being, including acupuncture, tai chi, qi gong, and the use of Chinese herbs for treating disease. Many Chinese \u201cherbs\u201d aren\u2019t actually herbs either, and sometimes include minerals or animal products that are formulated into teas, capsules, liquid extracts, and powders.\n\n\u201cTripterygium wilfordii Hook F (TwHF) is used in traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of joint pain, fever, chills, oedema, and local inflammation,\u201d the researchers wrote. It\u2019s sometimes called the Thunder God Vine and is recognized for its anti-inflammatory properties, as well as the ability to suppress the immune system and possibly fight cancer. Its ability to remedy these ailments, according to researchers of the new study, come from its chloroform-methanol extract and compounds \u2014 some of over 300 \u2014 derived from it, known as diterpenoids.\n\nKnown as the Thunder God Vine, tripterygium wilfordii Hook F might be better at treating rheumatoid arthritis than current medications. Qwert1234, Public Domain\n\nLooking to see just how effective this ancient remedy is, the researchers split a group of 207 patients with RA into three groups. Some took the RA medication methotrexate (12.5 milligrams once a week), while another group took 20 milligrams of TwHF three times a day, and the last group took a combination of both. The treatment period lasted 24 weeks \u2014 84 percent of participants got to the end.\n\nOf these participants, the researchers found that 46.5 percent of patients treated with methotrexate reached ACR 50, a level of response defined by the American College of Rheumatology indicating that symptoms were relieved by 50 percent. By comparison, 55 percent of patients who took the TwHF supplements, and 77 percent of patients who took both reached ACR 50.\n\nThe results are promising because all groups of patients showed similar patterns of symptom reduction. Meanwhile, those who took TwHF were more likely than the others to experience irregular periods \u2014 a known side effect \u2014 so the researchers said it would be best for postmenopausal women and those who are no longer interested in having children to take it. Furthermore, they said that 12.5 milligrams of methotrexate was lower than some doses given to RA patients in the U.S., and that it was unclear, though unlikely, whether higher doses would sway the results. For patients who can\u2019t afford methotrexate, TwHF may be a more affordable option if longer term studies prove their safety and efficacy.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "rheumatoid arthritis, chinese herbal medicine, tripterygium wilfordii hook f, thunder god vine, chinese herbs and arthritis", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "People have used traditional Chinese medicine for thousands of years, so it's no surprise that an herb known as the Thunder God Vine shows promise in treating rheumatoid arthritis (possibly) better than current medications.", "title": "Chinese Herb Shows Promise As Rheumatoid Arthritis Treatment", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/chinese-herb-shows-promise-rheumatoid-arthritis-treatment-could-be-cheaper-methotrexate-276592", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/04/14/chinese-herbal-medicine.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "People have used traditional Chinese medicine for thousands of years, so it's no surprise that an herb known as the Thunder God Vine shows promise in treating rheumatoid arthritis (possibly) better than current medications.", "title": "Chinese Herb Shows Promise As Rheumatoid Arthritis Treatment", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/chinese-herb-shows-promise-rheumatoid-arthritis-treatment-could-be-cheaper-methotrexate-276592", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/04/14/chinese-herbal-medicine.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/04/14/chinese-herbal-medicine.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-04-14T18:30:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-04-14T18:30:44-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "People have used traditional Chinese medicine for thousands of years, so it's no surprise that an herb known as the Thunder God Vine shows promise in treating rheumatoid arthritis (possibly) better than current medications."}, "article_summary": "Originating in ancient China, traditional Chinese medicine has been implemented in many parts of the world for thousands of years.\nPeople have used traditional Chinese medicine for thousands of years, so it's no surprise that an herb known as the Thunder God Vine shows promise in treating rheumatoid arthritis (possibly) better than current medications.\nFor patients who can\u2019t afford methotrexate, TwHF may be a more affordable option if longer term studies prove their safety and efficacy.\n\u201cTripterygium wilfordii Hook F (TwHF) is used in traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of joint pain, fever, chills, oedema, and local inflammation,\u201d the researchers wrote.\nBy comparison, 55 percent of patients who took the TwHF supplements, and 77 percent of patients who took both reached ACR 50."}
