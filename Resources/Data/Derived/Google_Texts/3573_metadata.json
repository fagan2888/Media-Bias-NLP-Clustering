Rick Scott, to expand its Medicaid program through the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe campaign\u2019s 10-day Kitchen Table Tour, in which both Crist and Taddeo visit Florida families, is intended to \u201chighlight the stress Florida\u2019s middle-class families are facing in Rick Scott\u2019s low-wage, high-cost economy,\u201d the Crist campaign says.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear, however, whether the Medicaid expansion program would have helped Wiley\u2019s brother.\n\nAccording to the information supplied by Wiley, her brother and the campaign, his income would have been too high to make him eligible for Medicaid coverage even under the expansion that Crist supports.\n\nScott has taken a public stance favoring expanding Medicaid under the ACA, which would cover the lion\u2019s share of the full cost of allowing eligibility to those just above the poverty line for 10 years.\n\nBut the state Legislature, dominated by Republicans, has refused the money, expected to be about $66.1 billion, according to a recent study, and Scott has not pressed the issue. Crist contends Scott has \u201csat on his hands.\u201d\n\nOpponents, including outgoing House Speaker Will Weatherford, R-Wesley Chapel, say they don\u2019t believe the federal government would be able to pay the tab and would leave the state holding the bag for a huge expansion of already burdensome Medicaid costs.\n\nThe Crist campaign chose the individuals they visit, including Wiley, from among people who responded to campaign mailings asking supporters to provide stories of economic problems including property insurance, utility rates, education and scholarship cuts and health care costs.\n\nWiley described herself as a liberal but says she has voted for some Republicans, including former Sen. Connie Mack and Crist, a former Republican who switched parties in 2012. She said she hasn\u2019t been involved in politics.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bad idea for the economy not to take care of the working poor,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople who thumb their nose at universal health care should think about what they would do if it was somebody in their family.\u201d\n\nWiley\u2019s brother, Wil Keener, a 55-year-old swimming pool construction and maintenance worker, lost his employer-provided health insurance when the industry collapsed during the recession. He said in an interview he hasn\u2019t been able to afford a private policy. At just under $30,000 a year, he makes too much to qualify for Medicaid.\n\nAfter he was diagnosed with cancer last year, he had to get $20,000 from another sister to pay for radiation treatments \u2014 a heavily discounted fee provided by sympathetic physicians at Bardmoor Cancer Center in Largo, he said.\n\nHe said he kept working through the therapy and is now making about $500 a week. \u201cIt was a little tough,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel real good, but I did it.\u201d\n\nWhen Bardmoor personnel sent him to government offices to seek assistance, he said, \u201cThey looked at me like I was insane. They said there was nothing they could do because I had a job.\u201d\n\nThe ACA Medicaid expansion would make the program\u2019s benefits available to those with incomes up to 138 percent of the federal poverty line.\n\nThis year, the poverty line is $11,670 for a single adult such as Keener, so with an income of $25,000 to $30,000, the expansion program still wouldn\u2019t make him eligible.\n\nOther programs exist to help people who are \u201cmedically needy,\u201d meaning they aren\u2019t poor but are burdened with medical expenses they can\u2019t handle, but Keener said he was told by the agencies he visited that no help was available.\n\nKeener said he has since tried to obtain a private policy through the exchange set up under the ACA but can\u2019t afford a policy with a deductible low enough to make it worthwhile.\n\nHe said doctors tell him his prognosis is \u201cvery good,\u201d with a 95 percent success rate. \u201cThey said the first year\u2019s the most important.\n\n\u201cI really don\u2019t know who to believe anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cI used to lean more Republican, but now I believe in my sisters and my family and God.\u201d\n\nAfter hearing Wiley, Taddeo said, \u201cThese stories have been heart-wrenching,\u201d and that failure to expand Medicaid \u201chas affected real people.\u201d\n\nwmarch@tampatrib.com\n\n(813) 259-7761", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Mon, 06 Oct 2014 22:06:00 -0400", "Description": "NEW TAMPA \u00ad\u00ad\u2014 Annette Taddeo, Charlie Crist\u2019s running mate in the Florida governor\u2019s race, visited Kathy Wiley in New Tampa on Monday to talk about health care in one o", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "NEW TAMPA \u00ad\u00ad\u2014 Annette Taddeo, Charlie Crist\u2019s running mate in the Florida governor\u2019s race, visited Kathy Wiley in New Tampa on Monday to talk about health care in one o", "title": "Crist\u2019s Kitchen Table Tour hits New Tampa", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/news/election/crists-kitchen-table-tour-hits-new-tampa-20141006/", "image": {"width": 3093, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20141006/ARTICLE/141009364/AR/0/AR-141009364.jpg", "height": 1854}, "updated_time": "2014-10-06T22:06:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "NEW TAMPA \u00ad\u00ad\u2014 Annette Taddeo, Charlie Crist\u2019s running mate in the Florida governor\u2019s race, visited Kathy Wiley in New Tampa on Monday to talk about health care in one", "title": "Crist\u2019s Kitchen Table Tour hits New Tampa", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20141006/ARTICLE/141009364/AR/0/AR-141009364.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2014-10-06T22:06:00Z-04", "modified_time": "2014-10-06T22:06:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Annette Taddeo, Charlie Crist\u2019s running mate in the Florida governor\u2019s race, visited Kathy Wiley in New Tampa on Monday to talk about health care in one of the campaign\u2019s series of \u201cKitchen Table\u201d events.\nThe campaign\u2019s 10-day Kitchen Table Tour, in which both Crist and Taddeo visit Florida families, is intended to \u201chighlight the stress Florida\u2019s middle-class families are facing in Rick Scott\u2019s low-wage, high-cost economy,\u201d the Crist campaign says.\nIt\u2019s not clear, however, whether the Medicaid expansion program would have helped Wiley\u2019s brother.\nWiley told the story of her brother\u2019s battle with throat cancer, a story intended to dramatize Florida\u2019s failure under Crist\u2019s opponent, Gov.\nThey said there was nothing they could do because I had a job.\u201dThe ACA Medicaid expansion would make the program\u2019s benefits available to those with incomes up to 138 percent of the federal poverty line."}
