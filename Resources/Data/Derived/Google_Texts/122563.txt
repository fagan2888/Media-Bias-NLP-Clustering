NEW YORK (MainStreet) — If you get a traffic ticket, conventional wisdom say's you'll wind up seeing a hike in your insurance rates — you know, for not being a "safe" driver and all.

But the conventional wisdom might be wrong. It turns out insurance companies don't pursue "unsafe" drivers as aggressively as you may think.

InsuranceQuotes.com says in an April study that only 19% of Americans who got a traffic ticket in the past five years are paying more for car insurance as a result. That's fewer than in the 2013 study, when 31% of Americans who got a traffic ticket in the previous five years saw an increase in premiums.

It's also not younger drivers racking up the majority of parking tickets. Rather, it's drivers between 30 and 49. Only a quarter of 18- to 29-year-olds got a ticket for a moving violation in the past five years, compared with 31% of 30- to 49-year olds — a slide upward in age that signals why so many ticketed older drivers dodge an insurance rate spike.

Checking a driver record can be costly, says Laura Adams, an InsuranceQuotes senior analyst, so most carriers check a young driver's record every six months and won't check an older driver's. "Insurers typically don't know as much about you as you might think," Adams says. "Oftentimes, unless you're a young driver, they are unaware of minor tickets and violations you receive on the road."

"Younger people have a bad reputation of being risky drivers and typically face additional scrutiny from insurance carriers," Adams says.

Insurance companies may be starting to catch on, and it's only good financial practice to take steps to keep your auto insurance costs down. There are some easy, effective ways.
