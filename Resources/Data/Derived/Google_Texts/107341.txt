A woman has been charged after her two children were found living in a wooden crate at the underground caves on East 23rd Street in Kansas City.

Brittany Mugrauer, 24, was charged with two counts of endangering the welfare of a child, according to the Jackson County Prosecutor's Office.

Jackson County Sheriff's deputies found the children on Thursday while they were investigating a possible chop shop at the caves.

According to court records, the children, ages 4 and 6, were covered in dirt and filth and barefoot. They were toward the back of the caves and were first discovered in a 10-by-8-foot wooden crate with car seats and blankets.

Investigators said the 4-year-old was eating a cup of dry ramen noodles that had dirt in it.

The children told deputies that they lived in the cave with mother and that "mema and papa live in a hotel," according to court documents.

The children were taken to a hospital to be evaluated.

Court records indicate that when Mugrauer was reached by phone, she told investigators that the children had been living in the cave for several days, and that she left them there without a parent.

Mugrauer was taken into custody on Friday. Prosecutors requested $75,000 bail.
