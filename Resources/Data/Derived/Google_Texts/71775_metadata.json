The retail giant has been shedding customers recently due to disorganized stores and empty shelves.\n\nWalmart started aggressively cutting staff during the recession. Over the past five years, its total American workforce dropped by 120,000, even as the company opened more than 500 new U.S. stores. The result is longer check-out lines, backlogged inventory, and poor customer service \u2014 not to mention employee protests all over the country. Now, amid plunging sales and massive strikes, even Walmart has conceded it can\u2019t run a business on a skeleton crew. Over the next few months, the company will move 35,000 part-time workers to full-time, and another 35,000 temporary workers will become part-time staff.\n\nAfter the Affordable Care Act kicks in January 1, Walmart\u2019s new full-time employees will be eligible for health insurance after 90 days, a vast improvement on the retailer\u2019s usual 6-month waiting period. To qualify for benefits, part-time staff must work an average of 30 hours a week for a year \u2014 no small feat at a company known to abruptly cancel shifts, cut hours, and lay off workers at any moment.\n\nWhile most stores will hire an army of temporary workers to handle the holiday season rush, Walmart has been relying almost exclusively on temps year-round. A Reuters survey of 52 stores in June found that most were hiring only temps, who must re-apply for their jobs after 180 days. Meanwhile, existing long-time employees have seen their hours reduced drastically.\n\nWalmart, as the nation\u2019s largest private employer, exerts a powerful influence on other large companies. As Walmart slashed employees\u2019 hours, jobs report after jobs report showed the biggest gains in a part-time, low-wage workforce.\n\nNot only is the Walmart model bad for workers and business, it\u2019s also terrible for the taxpayer. The company\u2019s refusal to pay a living wage and benefits forces most of its employees onto public benefits like food stamps and Medicaid. Each store\u2019s workforce consumes as much as $1.75 million in public benefits each year.\n\nWalmart defends its poor labor practices as necessary to keep prices down. But as Walmart\u2019s sales dropped with its payrolls, other retailers have proven that treating workers well is not mutually exclusive to a good deal. Walmart\u2019s competitor, Costco, offers its employees an average wage of $21.96 an hour, about 40 percent more than Walmart employees make. Costco enjoyed a 19 percent increase in profits last quarter as Walmart sank, generating much more revenue and profit per worker. WinCo, a smaller grocery chain based in Idaho, boasts full health benefits for anyone working over 24 hours a week and retirement accounts for more than 400 workers \u2014 while maintaining prices even lower than Walmart\u2019s.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "The exploitative retail giant seems to be conceding that skeleton crews won't do.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "The retail giant is moving more part-time workers to full-time status to appease complaints of empty shelves and long lines.", "title": "After Sales Plummet, Walmart Realizes It Can\u2019t Run Stores On Temps Alone", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2013/09/24/2669191/walmart-adds-fulltime-workers/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/walmart_supercenter-e1380029524267.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The retail giant is moving more part-time workers to full-time status to appease complaints of empty shelves and long lines.", "title": "After Sales Plummet, Walmart Realizes It Can\u2019t Run Stores On Temps Alone", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/walmart_supercenter-e1380029524267-321x214.jpeg", "creator": "@avivash", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-economy", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/walmart_supercenter-e1380029524267.jpeg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/walmart_supercenter-e1380029524267.jpeg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-24T09:54:26+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/avivawshen"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf19d\"", "article_summary": "Economy After Sales Plummet, Walmart Realizes It Can\u2019t Run Stores On Temps Alone CREDIT:After cutting employees\u2019 hours so deeply that stores could not keep their shelves stocked, Walmart is adding more full-time workers in time for the holiday shopping season.\nOver the next few months, the company will move 35,000 part-time workers to full-time, and another 35,000 temporary workers will become part-time staff.\nWalmart\u2019s competitor, Costco, offers its employees an average wage of $21.96 an hour, about 40 percent more than Walmart employees make.\nNow, amid plunging sales and massive strikes, even Walmart has conceded it can\u2019t run a business on a skeleton crew.\nAs Walmart slashed employees\u2019 hours, jobs report after jobs report showed the biggest gains in a part-time, low-wage workforce."}
