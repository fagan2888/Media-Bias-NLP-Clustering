UTRECHT, Netherlands — Tour de France champion Vincenzo Nibali’s Astana team issued a “no comment” Friday after teammate Lars Boom was tested with an abnormally low cortisol level.

Astana is part of the Movement for Credible Cycling, a group of teams holding to stricter anti-doping measures than those of the sport’s governing body. MPCC rules stipulate that a rider with a low cortisol level should be prescribed with a period of rest.

Low cortisol levels can indicate cortisone doping but are not a conclusive proof of doping, meaning that Boom will be allowed to start Saturday’s first stage — an individual time trial in the Dutch city of Utrecht — if Astana decides to go against the MPCC recommendations.

Reached by The Associated Press, Astana spokesman Chris Baldwin said he had “no comment” to make.

The MPCC later issued a statement saying that Astana confirmed Boom was the rider concerned by the test carried out by cycling’s governing body.

“In the case of abnormally low cortisol levels, competition will resume after an additional eight-day rest minimum, and back-to-normal cortisol levels,” the MPCC said, underlining why Boom should potentially be removed for “health” reasons.

Astana has been answering questions of its own in recent months, after five senior and development-squad riders were caught doping with EPO and steroids since last August.

Cycling’s governing body, the UCI, even said there were “compelling grounds” to request that Astana, which is backed by the Kazakhstan government, be stripped of its license altogether.
