That's why they\u2019ve been clamoring for a different approach.\" \"Repeal and replace,\" McConnell continued. \"That's what Americans really want.\" [...] Five years, and it's still \"we'll let you know\"?\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is taking a page from his House Republican colleagues who totally have a plan to save Obamacare subsidies but are keeping it secret for now. McConnell said Monday that Senate Republicans \"will be ready\" and they just need to wait for the court and he can't talk about that plan now, but \"we'll let you know depending on the outcome of the decision,\" what the plan is. Uh, huh. That triggered a memory forwriter Jay Bookman, the memory of Mitch McConnell promising a plan to \"repeal and replace\" Obamacare five years ago News flash.
