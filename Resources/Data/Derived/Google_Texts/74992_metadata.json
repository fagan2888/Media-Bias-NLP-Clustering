Apparently, Yogi spun that gem of a line when giving a friend directions to his house in New Jersey. However, those \u201cdirections\u201d might as well have come from the Fed last week. The Fed\u2019s mixed messages on their view of the U.S. economy, the state of other nations\u2019 financial markets, and their intentions for monetary policy for the remainder of 2015 have left investors and traders as confused as Yogi\u2019s friend must have been.\n\nWhile it is true that events such as Volkswagen\u2019s emission scandal, the continued meltdown in Brazil now spilling over into other emerging markets, and further weakness in commodities have all led to sharp increases in volatility and weaker risk markets across the board, the uncertainty and outright confusion over what the Federal Reserve is going to do or say next dominates the investment landscape.\n\nAn appropriate analogy to what investors are going through now with monetary policy uncertainty is what business owners went through while they waited for the details of Obamacare. It was tough to create a budget and commit capital to a business without knowing the details or cost of the upcoming health care legislation. This sort of paralysis is what appears to be taking hold in the business of capital markets now.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "CUInsight", "description": "The title of this week\u2019s post comes from a quote from the dearly departed baseball legend Lawrence \u201cYogi\u201d Berra.\u00a0 Apparently, Yogi spun that gem of a line when giving a friend directions to his house in New Jersey. \u00a0However, those \u201cdirections\u201d might as well have come from the Fed last week.\u00a0 The Fed\u2019s mixed messages \u2026", "title": "When you get to a fork in the road...take it! - CUInsight", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://www.cuinsight.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bigstock-Fork-In-The-Road-60732081.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-10-02T07:07:02-04:00", "url": "https://www.cuinsight.com/when-you-get-to-a-fork-in-the-road-take-it.html", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CUinsight?fref=ts&ref=br_tf", "section": "Lending", "tag": "Yogi Berra", "published_time": "2015-09-28T12:08:32-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-02T07:07:02-04:00"}, "twitter": {"site": "@CUinsight", "creator": "@CUinsight", "description": "The title of this week\u2019s post comes from a quote from the dearly departed baseball legend Lawrence \u201cYogi\u201d Berra.\u00a0 Apparently, Yogi spun that gem of a line when giving a friend directions to his house in New Jersey. \u00a0However, those \u201cdirections\u201d might as well have come from the Fed last week.\u00a0 The Fed\u2019s mixed messages [\u2026]", "card": "summary", "title": "When you get to a fork in the road...take it! - CUInsight"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Apparently, Yogi spun that gem of a line when giving a friend directions to his house in New Jersey.\nAn appropriate analogy to what investors are going through now with monetary policy uncertainty is what business owners went through while they waited for the details of Obamacare.\nThis sort of paralysis is what appears to be taking hold in the business of capital markets now.\nThe title of this week\u2019s post comes from a quote from the dearly departed baseball legend Lawrence \u201cYogi\u201d Berra.\nIt was tough to create a budget and commit capital to a business without knowing the details or cost of the upcoming health care legislation."}
