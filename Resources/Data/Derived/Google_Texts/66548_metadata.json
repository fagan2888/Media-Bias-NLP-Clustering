Snisky allegedly used much of the money\n\n\n\nto pay his mortgage and cover the agents\u2019 commissions, the SEC said when it filed charges against him in November. That case is pending in federal court in Colorado\n\nThe SEC said three of the agents raised approximately $1.5 million for Snisky, promising the investors their money was being invested in safe government-backed bonds. The agents \u2014 Kenneth C. Meissner of Fair Oaks Branch, Tex., James Doug Scott of Perkasie, Penn., and Mark S. Tomich of Belmont, Mich. \u2014 were paid a total of $90,000 in commissions.\n\nA fourth agent, David C.
