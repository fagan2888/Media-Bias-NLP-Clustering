My earliest memory is standing next to my mom on a pew, with three fingers in my mouth, during the candlelit, hushed moments of a novena to Mother Mary.\n\nMy mom\u2019s name was Dolores, which I learned is a name for Mary, the Mother of Sorrows. After Catholic grade school, I entered on 13 years of seminary prep to become a priest. After ordination I spent more years studying ministry and became a seminary prof for 17 years, including six in Denver at the late St. Thomas Seminary. After leaving the priesthood (another story, another column), I worked in nonprofits for 20 years, and spiritually I\u2019m now an Irish Catholic Episcopalian, with Jewish and Quaker tendencies. There\u2019s about eight of us.\n\nThis history is to say that I have read lots of papal and church documents in my day, but I have never read anything quite like \u201cThe Joy of the Gospel\u201d by Pope Francis. None like this.\n\nHe calls it an exhortation instead of an encyclical; it\u2019s more personal and pastoral than doctrinal and doctrinaire. The 288 paragraphs still have enough pious gobbledegook to pass muster with the cardinals-in-waiting, but this message is meant to engage new minds and attract new hearts. He often writes in the first person, an inviting \u201cI\u201d instead of the distancing, literal Papal \u201cWe.\u201d And what he says is thrilling.\n\nA blunt, refreshing beginning: \u201cThe great danger in today\u2019s world, pervaded as it is by consumerism, is the desolation and anguish born of a complacent yet covetous heart, the feverish pursuit of frivolous pleasures, and a blunted conscience.\u201d\n\nThose following Jesus need to evangelize in the face of this with a certain fierce joy: \u201can evangelizer must never look like someone who has just come back from a funeral!\u201d\n\nWe are to go into our world not in a great rush, but to slow down and listen to others. This is not a church of my childhood, \u201cAn Army of youth \u2018neath the standard of Truth, fighting for Christ our Lord\u201d as a popular hymn went. We are more humble, while no less steely.\n\n\u201cI prefer a Church which is bruised, hurting and dirty because it has been out on the streets, rather than a Church which is unhealthy from being confined and from clinging to its own security. I do not want a Church concerned with being at the center and which then ends being caught up in a web of obsessions and procedures.\u201d Notice the \u201cI;\u201d elsewhere he talks about when he was in Argentina, very personally. He remains one of us, while asked to lead.\n\nAs he warms to his theme, the first section takes on controversial economic and social topics in a stark \u201cYes\u201d and \u201cNo\u201d format.\n\n\u201cThe hearts of many people are gripped by fear and desperation, even in the so-called rich countries. The joy of living frequently fades, lack of respect for others and violence are on the rise, and inequality is increasingly evident. It is a struggle to live and, often, to live with precious little dignity\u2026 We are in an age of knowledge and information, which has led to new and often anonymous kinds of power.\u201d\n\nSo the litany begins: No to an economy of exclusion. \u201cTo sustain a lifestyle which excludes others, or to sustain enthusiasm for that selfish ideal, a globalization of indifference has developed. Almost without being aware of it, we end up being incapable of feeling compassion at the outcry of the poor, weeping for other people\u2019s pain, and feeling a need to help them, as though all this were someone else\u2019s responsibility and not our own. The culture of prosperity deadens us; we are thrilled if the market offers us something new to purchase. In the meantime all those lives stunted for lack of opportunity seem a mere spectacle; they fail to move us.\u201d\n\nNo to the new idolatry of money. The man stands at the corner of Wall & Main streets and claims \u201cWhile the earnings of a minority are growing exponentially, so too is the gap separating the majority from the prosperity enjoyed by those happy few. This imbalance is the result of ideologies which defend the absolute autonomy of the marketplace and financial speculation.\u201d\n\nHe presumes to suggest that the hand of God and the invisible hand of the marketplace are not as one.\n\nNo to a financial system which rules rather than serves. \u201cMoney must serve, not rule\u201d! The Pope loves everyone, rich and poor alike, but he is obliged in the name of Christ to remind all that the rich must help, respect and promote the poor. \u201cI exhort you to generous solidarity and to the return of economics and finance to an ethical approach which favors human beings.\u201d\n\nNo to the inequality which spawns violence. \u201cToday we hear a call for greater security. But until exclusion and inequality in society and between peoples are reversed, it will be impossible to eliminate violence. The poor and the poorer peoples are accused of violence, yet without equal opportunities the different forms of aggression and conflict will find a fertile terrain for growth and eventually explode. When a society\u2026is willing to leave a part of itself on the fringes, no political programs or resources spent on law enforcement or surveillance systems can indefinitely guarantee tranquility.\u201d This builds on Paul VI\u2019s bumper-sticker words, \u201cIf you want Peace, work for Justice.\u201d\n\nNo to selfishness and spiritual sloth. Listen to this. \u201cAnd so the biggest threat of all gradually takes shape: the gray pragmatism of the daily life of the Church, in which all appears to proceed normally, while in reality faith is wearing down and degenerating into small-mindedness. A tomb psychology thus develops and slowly transforms Christians into mummies in a museum.\u201d Francis sounds like he\u2019s previewed \u201cA Night at the Museum 3: Secrets of the Tomb,\u201d and is scared the church is slow-walking into zombiehood!\n\nSo what is the antidote to future mummyhood? Yes to the new relationships brought by Christ.\n\n\u201cWe sense the challenge of finding and sharing a \u201cmystique\u201d of living together, of mingling and encounter, of embracing and supporting one another, of stepping into this flood tide which, while chaotic, can become a genuine experience of fraternity, a caravan of solidarity, a sacred pilgrimage. Greater possibilities for communication thus turn into greater possibilities for encounter and solidarity for everyone. If we were able to take this route, it would be so good, so soothing, so liberating and hope-filled!\u201d\n\nFrancis asks that Catholics, and all believers, keep an ear to the people, expect the inclusion of the poor in society, and that we heed God\u2019s plea on the poor\u2019s behalf. \u201cThe old question always returns: \u2018How does God\u2019s love abide in anyone who has the world\u2019s goods, and sees a brother or sister in need and yet refuses help?\u2019 (1 Jn 3:17). Let us recall also how bluntly the apostle James speaks of the cry of the oppressed: \u2018The wages of the laborers who mowed your fields, which you kept back by fraud, cry out, and the cries of the harvesters have reached the ears of the Lord of hosts.\u2019 \u201d\n\nMaybe that\u2019s enough Gospel at one sitting. I admit, I am close to falling under the spell of the man and his message. He has other sections in the letter about women, about peace, politicians, the common good, human trafficking. I don\u2019t mean to slight any of those persons and topics, but I just wanted to whet your appetite. You can find the whole piece online at the Vatican\u2019s website.\n\nThe present Pope near the end wonders if, \u201cSometimes we are tempted to be that kind of Christian who keeps the Lord\u2019s wounds at arm\u2019s length. Yet Jesus wants us to touch human misery, to touch the suffering flesh of others. He hopes that we will stop looking for those personal or communal niches which shelter us from the maelstrom of human misfortune and instead enter into the reality of other people\u2019s lives and know the power of tenderness. Whenever we do so, our lives become wonderfully complicated and we experience intensely what it is to be a people, to be part of a people.\u201d\n\nHe ends with a traditional prayer to Mary, calling her Mother of the living Gospel, wellspring of happiness for God\u2019s little ones.
