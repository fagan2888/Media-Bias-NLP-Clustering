Filed under Opinion.\n\nVote Hillary Clinton\n\nBy Brianna Spieldenner, Opinion Editor\n\nAs the primary season comes to an end, both Democratic candidates seem neck to neck in the fight for the nomination. However, liberal college students everywhere seem to be leaning more towards Sanders instead of Clinton.\n\nClinton has just as much chance, perhaps even more, of being in the White House next year as anyone else. Sure, Clinton has some dirt behind her, but that is not uncommon at all for presidential candidates.\n\nWhat\u2019s more important is her plans for the future of America. According to Clinton\u2019s official website, she plans to expand the Affordable Care Act. Her active passions include being a champion of families and children, college campus sexual assault prevention, public education, affordable college, and human rights, particularly for women, the LGBT community and immigrants.\n\nClinton also aims to make America \u201cthe clean energy superpower of the 21st century\u201d by installing 500 million solar panels to power all houses in America, as well as lower waste and oil consumption by a third. Of all the candidates, she takes the strongest stance against guns.\n\nShe has done more than enough to prove that she is a strong candidate, including her past work as Secretary of State, First Lady and Senator, among other accomplishments. While her opponents claim that she fluctuates her positions, her stance on human rights has been the same since 1995, where she stated in a famous speech that \u201cHuman rights are women\u2019s rights, and women\u2019s rights are human rights.\u201d\n\nClinton is clearly progressive due to her platform, but she also appeals to some moderate conservatives as well, and sometimes left-wing Democrats forget that these voters have a voice in this country, too. This would undoubtedly help her influence change in Congress, something that Obama was often criticized for lacking.\n\nShe is the only candidate who has a realistic plan for the next few years, and the means to act upon it. If we want actual change to happen, she is\n\nDon\u2019t Vote Hillary Clinton\n\nBy Sam York, Contributing Writer\n\nMany people are wary of Clinton\u2019s true viability in a general election matchup. Up to 60 percent of voters view her unfavorably, according to the Real Clear Politics polling averages.\n\nClinton often touts her impressive record. She has served as New York Senator and Secretary of State, as well as First Lady of both Arkansas and the nation. However, her decisions in these positions raise quite a few liberal eyebrows.\n\nClinton\u2019s idealistic challenger in the Democratic Primary, Bernie Sanders, consistently points out that her opinion is swayed by donor money. This is a valid criticism. In an interview from 2004, current Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren pointed out that Clinton changed her opinion on the \u201cBankruptcy Bill\u201d after raking in millions from corporate donors. Additionally, she has accepted an average of $214,000 for private speeches to large financial institutions on Wall Street, such as Bank of America and Goldman Sachs.\n\nMeanwhile, her Super PAC has raised tens of millions from industries such as Big Pharma and the fossil fuel industry, according to opensecrets.org.\n\nHer \u201cyes\u201d vote on the war in Iraq has become one of the biggest stories of the campaign season.\n\nThese facts make a progressive like myself hesitant to vote for Clinton. Hillary Clinton doesn\u2019t understand that my vote has to be earned. I won\u2019t blindly vote for her, just because she is a Democrat.\n\nAt the end of the day, it\u2019s better for progressives to keep the flames of the revolution alight than to cave in to the demands of the political establishment.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Online Current", "description": "Vote Hillary Clinton By Brianna Spieldenner,\u00a0Opinion Editor As the primary season comes to an end, both Democratic candidates seem neck to neck in the fight for the nomination.
