He dropped his bid for the White House in November.\n\nEdwards also called out the state for its low marks in education, saying it must make college more affordable while working toward a goal of funding higher education with 50 percent state support and 50 percent tuition and fees.\n\nFor K-12 education he said the state should end what he called the overuse of costly standardized testing and shift power over budget and educational decisions to local school boards.\n\nEdwards also called on the state to raise the minimum wage, fight poverty, and ensure women and men receive equal pay for equal work.\n\n(Reporting by Rory Carroll; Editing by Sandra Maler)", "article_metadata": {"DCSext.ContentID_healthNews": "USKCN0UP2ES20160111", "sailthru.author": "Rory Carroll", "Author": "Rory Carroll", "DCSext.PageNumber": 1, "twitter": {"description": "Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards laid out his agenda during his inaugural address on Monday, pledging to expand Medicaid, enact education reforms, and find long-term solutions to the state's large budget deficit.", "title": "Louisiana governor pledges to expand Medicaid in inaugural address", "image": "http://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20160111&t=2&i=1108755695&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=LYNXNPEC0A1CG", "creator": "@Reuters", "site": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "DCSext.rChannel": "Article -
