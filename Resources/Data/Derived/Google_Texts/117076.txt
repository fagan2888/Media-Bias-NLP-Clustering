A new survey shows 63 percent of Kansas elementary students have 20 minutes or less for daily recess and only 41 percent of schools have policies prohibiting it from being withheld as a punishment.

The survey will be presented Wednesday during the Kansas Board of Education meeting in Topeka. It was conducted in fall 2014, with nearly 490 Kansas physical education teachers responding. The Kansas State Department of Education collaborated on the report with the Kansas Association for Health, Physical Education, Recreation and Dance.

Other findings include that 61 percent of students don't have lunch recess before eating. Research has shown that students eat healthier when they have a pre-lunch recess.

Concerns have arisen nationally that schools are devoting less time to recess.
