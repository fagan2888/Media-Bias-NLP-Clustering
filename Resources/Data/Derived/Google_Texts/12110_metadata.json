Health News Florida special correspondent Carol Gentry reports on a loophole that may affect their choice of coverage.\n\nMillions of Floridians -- including 175,000 state workers and their families -- are in health plans that place them at risk for whopping surprise bills after hospital treatment.\n\nThese are plans that have networks of contracted doctors and hospitals but are not HMOs. Most of the plans with this risk are preferred provider organizations, or PPOs.\n\nTraditionally, PPOs have been willing to cover a substantial amount toward an out-of-network bill \u2013 say 60 percent \u2013 but recently some are covering only a small fraction, leaving the bulk of it in the lap of the patient.\n\nThis consumer problem, called \"balance billing,\" has been around for decades but was rare when plans had broad networks of providers and could pass along price increases. Now, insurers have narrowed their networks of doctors and hospitals, spurring specialists to band together to exert market power, refusing to sign contracts if the insurer pays less than they want.\n\nThose at risk include an estimated 1.7 million Floridians enrolled in PPOs through the individual and group markets, plus an unknown number in PPO-style plans sponsored by large employers, said Rich Robleto, director of the health insurance division at the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation.\n\nRobleto said large employers that self-insure and contract out claims processing to a company \u2013 the way state government contracts with Florida Blue -- are not regulated by the state.\n\nOn Jan. 1, a four-year contract between the State Group Health Insurance Plan and Florida Blue took effect. It gives Florida Blue administrators the power to decide what a suitable payment should be for out-of-network treatment for the PPO enrollees.\n\nSometimes it\u2019s only a tiny fraction of the bill. David Rogers, who is a member of the University of South Florida chemistry faculty and has a Florida Blue PPO plan, discovered the realities of balance billing in April when his wife Melanie suddenly suffered severe abdominal pain. It was 4 a.m. so they went to a Tampa hospital emergency room where the case was considered an emergency. Four months later they got a bill from the surgeon who performed a minor procedure: $27,000.\n\nSince the hospital was in the Florida Blue network, the couple's plan paid most of the hospital charges. But the surgeon was not in the network, and Florida Blue allowed only $600 toward his bill.\n\nThat left the Rogers to pay $26,400.\n\nThey appealed but Blue turned them down, pointing to the language on page 14 of the PPO plan description. In a box, in bold type, the description warns that Florida Blue covers bills from non-network providers according to an \u201callowance\u201d and that any remaining amount must be paid by the plan member.\n\n\u201cWe were encouraged to negotiate with the provider,\u201d Rogers said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t negotiate with us, so we were pretty much stuck.\u201d\n\nHow many Floridians have network-style plans that could be subject to balance billing is unclear. However, a recent Mercer benefits study based on a national survey of large employers found that about 66 percent of workers and their families were enrolled in PPOs, with HMOs running far behind in popularity.\n\nUnder Florida law, only HMO enrollees are protected from balance billing. An effort to extend the same protection to consumers in PPOs and other plans with networks -- at least in emergencies -- failed during the 2015 legislative session in Tallahassee. It drew heated opposition from certain specialty groups, from ambulance services and others.\n\nThe staff of the state\u2019s Insurance Consumer Advocate tried to help, but had no authority to do anything about balance billing. Sha\u2019Ron James, the new advocate, asked Rogers testify at a public hearing on the issue Oct. 15.\n\nAfter hearing what happened to Rogers, his friends are bailing out of PPOs, he said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re switching to HMOs because it doesn\u2019t make any sense to be paying for insurance that doesn\u2019t cover you,\u201d he said.\n\nFlorida Blue Vice President Jason Altmire said he can\u2019t speak about specific cases but confirmed that balance billing is growing and hurting a lot of patients. The company wants to see more \u201ctransparency\u201d on costs and charges, he said, but balance billing is an issue that only the legislature can solve.\n\n\u201cThe Legislature didn\u2019t have the votes or support (this year) to make it happen. I\u2019m sure they\u2019re going to bring it up in January,\u201d he said to a reporter. \u201cFolks like you talking about it would help.\u201d\n\nSpecial correspondent Carol Gentry is part of WUSF in Tampa.
