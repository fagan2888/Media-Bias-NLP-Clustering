Thanks to the health law, millions more people can seek care with newly gained insurance.\n\nRelated: Doctors Leave Primary Care As More Patients Need Them\n\nBut there\u2019s growing debate about whether nurse practitioners and physician assistants should provide a lot more basic care, either on their own or as part of clinics sponsored by pharmacies or other businesses. Some major doctor groups have challenged the ability of lesser-trained medical professionals to independently treat patients.\n\nGlen Stream, chairman of the new coalition, said that it plans to focus on:\n\n\u2013 Paying primary-care doctors for more than just office visits, including the time they spend making referrals to specialists, checking in with patients about treatment regimens, being available 24/7 and calling and emailing patients. Specialty doctors generally are paid more for their time and for procedures they do.\n\n\u2013 Creating additional incentives for medical school students to go into primary care and tying medical schools\u2019 federal funding to the primary care training they provide.\n\n\u2013 Making electronic health records less burdensome, freeing more time for conversation with patients.\n\n\u2013 Getting doctors to switch to a team-based, patient-centered \u201cmedical home\u201d format, with a payment structure that reflects the work that goes into coordinating care for a patient.\n\n\u2013 Persuading private and public employers with health plans to lean on insurers to increase compensation for primary care services.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t spend enough on primary care, outcomes in the future will suffer because much of the chronic diseases that drive spending are preventable,\u201d said Stream, a family physician and former president of the American Academy of Family Physicians.\n\nRelated: Find Out Who Your Doc Is Taking Money From\n\nHe added that larger employers could negotiate higher payment rates for primary care when picking an insurance company.\n\nWhile the campaign is touted as helping patients, it\u2019s also about asserting that family doctors are important.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always a question of what motivates groups to do these kind of campaigns \u2014 is it looking out for patients or your own interests, and generally it\u2019s a combination of both,\u201d said Atul Grover, chief public policy officer at the Association of American Medical Colleges.\n\nIn September, the American Academy of Family Physicians announced recommendations on medical school funding, saying teaching hospitals should provide more primary care training as a condition of continuing federal funding at the same level. But Grover said the kind of training medical students receive doesn\u2019t drive what type of doctor they become. The reimbursement system \u2013 which typically pays specialists at higher rates \u2013 is more important.\n\nRelated: Obamacare Aftermath - Fewer Doctors, Higher Costs\n\nGrover also said that while primary care is important, taking funding away from specialty training isn\u2019t necessarily a solution because an aging population will need more specialty care.\n\nOther groups in the coalition are the American Academy of Family Physicians Foundation, American Board of Family Medicine, American College of Osteopathic Family Physicians, Association of Departments of Family Medicine, Association of Family Medicine Residency Directors, the North American Primary Care Research Group and the Society of Teachers of Family Medicine.\n\nThis article originally appeared in Kaiser Health News.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Family medicine doctors are joining forces to win a bigger role in health care \u2013 and b", "title": "The Family Docs\u2019 $20M Push to Earn More Money", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/10/27/Family-Docs-20M-Push-Earn-More-Money", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/05042010_Med_finance_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/10/27/Family-Docs-20M-Push-Earn-More-Money", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/05042010_Med_finance_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Family medicine doctors are joining forces to win a bigger role in health care \u2013 and b", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1e74\"", "article_summary": "Other groups in the coalition are the American Academy of Family Physicians Foundation, American Board of Family Medicine, American College of Osteopathic Family Physicians, Association of Departments of Family Medicine, Association of Family Medicine Residency Directors, the North American Primary Care Research Group and the Society of Teachers of Family Medicine.\nFamily medicine doctors are joining forces to win a bigger role in health care \u2013 and be paid for it.\n\u2013 Creating additional incentives for medical school students to go into primary care and tying medical schools\u2019 federal funding to the primary care training they provide.\nRelated: Find Out Who Your Doc Is Taking Money FromHe added that larger employers could negotiate higher payment rates for primary care when picking an insurance company.\nBut Grover said the kind of training medical students receive doesn\u2019t drive what type of doctor they become."}
