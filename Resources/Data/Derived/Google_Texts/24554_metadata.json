So it's generally speaking a much more accurate return.\" You may also qualify for free help on your filing, either through e-filing or through local assistance. \"You can do it online for free by going to our website, or you can go to a volunteer income tax assistance site. These are organizations that are in your community including AARP that does tax counselling for the elderly.\"\n\nFiling officially opens January 19th, and thanks to a special holiday in Washington DC on April 15th, will complete on Monday April 18th.
