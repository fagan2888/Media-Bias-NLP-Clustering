He\u2019s retired from practicing internal medicine at Centegra Health System. Now that he\u2019s retired, he\u2019s devoting more time to the clinic pro bono.\n\nMowery is not alone. There are a number of doctors who quietly do significant volunteer work in McHenry County from different practices and health systems. Many of them volunteer through Family Health Partnership Clinic. Monday is National Doctors\u2019 Appreciation Day.\n\nFHPC sees about 2,500 patients a year, in about 8,000 visits, and the clinic relies heavily on its doctors to provide care at little or no cost to the patient. The patients either have no access to health insurance or cannot afford it.\n\n\u201cI believe everybody has a right to affordable medical care,\u201d Mowery said. \u201cThe fact that 40 million people can\u2019t afford insurance is a travesty as far as I\u2019m concerned.\u201d\n\nSome doctors appreciate the clinic where they can simply stick to the medicine, Hoban said.\n\n\u201cWhat draws people here is that they can really practice medicine with compassion,\u201d she said. \u201cThey don\u2019t have to wrestle with HMOs. They don\u2019t have to wrestle with insurance companies \u2013 because no one has insurance here. It\u2019s a very level playing field.\u201d\n\nAlthough there are a number of doctors who volunteer at the clinic, Mowery would like to see more, but he understands that family and professional pressures keep some from offering their time and skills.\n\nDr. Ann Dilla is a Centegra family doctor based in Spring Grove and volunteers at the clinic several hours a month.\n\n\u201cYou make time if it\u2019s important,\u201d Dilla said. \u201cFamily Health Partnership Clinic is one of the best run clinics I\u2019ve ever been in. \u2026 Because it\u2019s so well run, you find time.\u201d\n\nDr. Tom Meyer is a obstetrician and gynecologist with Advocate Health System, and practices in Barrington. He also volunteers several hours each month.\n\n\u201cI really believe in what they\u2019re doing,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re really patient-oriented. \u2026 You feel good when you\u2019re done there. You feel like you\u2019ve done something.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"copyright": "2016 Northwest Herald", "og": {"url": "http://www.nwherald.com/2015/03/27/doctors-appreciation-day-docs-offer-free-care-at-crystal-lake-clinic/axrdi00/", "image": "http://www.nwherald.com/_internal/cimg!0/tqq5ecrdr00sc99ami2p9bf7p8w39kd", "site_name": "Northwest Herald", "description": "CRYSTAL LAKE \u2013 Suzanne Hoban said it takes a \u201cspecial kind of doctor\u201d to work at the Family Health Partnership Clinic.", "title": "Doctors' Appreciation Day: Docs offer free care at Crystal Lake clinic"}, "twitter": {"site": "@nwherald", "image": "http://www.nwherald.com/_internal/cimg!0/tqq5ecrdr00sc99ami2p9bf7p8w39kd", "description": "CRYSTAL LAKE \u2013 Suzanne Hoban said it takes a \u201cspecial kind of doctor\u201d to work at the Family Health Partnership Clinic.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Doctors' Appreciation Day: Docs offer free care at Crystal Lake clinic"}, "robots": "All", "revisit-after": "1 Days", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1071875123", "fb": {"pages": 13044672572}, "tout": {"article": {"id": "4c0b64b8-37f9-4709-bb26-7fb0fda2e60c"}}, "keywords": "#crystallake, crystal lake, mchenry county, spring grove, barrington", "distribution": "Global", "viewport": "width=device-width, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "CRYSTAL LAKE \u2013 Suzanne Hoban said it takes a \u201cspecial kind of doctor\u201d to work at the Family Health Partnership Clinic.\n\u201cFamily Health Partnership Clinic is one of the best run clinics I\u2019ve ever been in.\nMany of them volunteer through Family Health Partnership Clinic.\nThere are a number of doctors who quietly do significant volunteer work in McHenry County from different practices and health systems.\nIn fact, it has 29 \u201cspecial\u201d doctors who volunteer their services at the Crystal Lake-based clinic, where the only common denominator in patients is they are uninsured."}
