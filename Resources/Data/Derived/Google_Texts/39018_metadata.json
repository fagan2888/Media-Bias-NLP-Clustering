Yet moose are still dying, and scientists are stymied.\n\nStress and brain worm, both exacerbated by a changing climate, may be playing off each other in moose deaths, which are twice the normal rate for sustaining the animal\u2019s population, The New York Times reported on March 5. The bottom line, though, is that it's still a mystery.\n\nWinters are both warming and growing shorter\u2014this year\u2019s seemingly interminable frigid temperatures notwithstanding\u2014and this may both compromise the moose\u2019s immune system and boost the number of white-tailed deer, which carry brain worm, a parasite that is fatal to moose.\n\nNative experts and scientists have been studying the die-off, which The New York Times also reported on in October. Several tribes canceled their seasonal hunts while the decline was studied.\n\nRELATED: Minnesota Tribes Cancel Moose Hunt as Animals' Population Plummets\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not necessarily convinced that brain worm is the silver bullet that\u2019s killing all of the moose,\u201d said Seth Moore, a wildlife biologist in Grand Portage, to The New York Times. \u201cThere are a number of different issues.\u201d\n\nMinnesota seems to be the epicenter of the die-off, as New Scientist reported back in October, but it is occurring all along the southern edge of the moose\u2019s range, including places like Sweden. And the causes are disparate, leading researchers to suspect an underlying cause that all have in common.\n\n\"The fact that you've got different proximate causes killing off the moose suggests there's an underlying ultimate cause,\" said Dennis Murray, a biology professor at Trent University in Peterborough, Ontario, Canada, to New Scientist.\n\n\u201cThe combined effects of climate change, parasitism and poor nutrition are involved in the die-off, and in the foreseeable future these factors likely will drive the population to extinction,\u201d Murray wrote on the web page describing the lab\u2019s research. \u201cConsequently, we predict that over the next decades a widespread northward push of the distributional limit for moose will occur.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times has a stirring video posted on its site with the story.
