And if either of those two men were to end up as the Republican nominee, you can pretty well expect that Kasich\u2019s attacks will end up in Democratic campaign ads in Ohio.\n\nKasich began by talking about all the people he\u2019s met on the campaign trail, particularly in the early state of New Hampshire. \u201cBut you know, I want to let you all know: Do you know how crazy this election is?\u201d he said, to laughter from the crowd of his local supporters. \u201cLet me tell you something: I\u2019ve about had it with these people.\u201d\n\n(Video via Marc Kovac.)\n\nKasich continued:\n\nAnd let me tell you why: We got one candidate [Carson] that says that we ought to abolish Medicaid and Medicare. You ever heard of anything so crazy as that \u2014 telling our people in this country who are seniors, or about to be seniors, that we\u2019re gonna abolish Medicaid and Medicare? We\u2019ve got one person [Carson again] saying we ought to have a 10 percent flat tax that\u2019ll drive up the deficit in this country by trillions of dollars \u2014 that my daughters will spend the rest of their lives having to pay off. You know, what I say to them is, why don\u2019t we have no taxes? Just get rid of them all, and then a chicken in every pot on top of it. We got one guy [Donald Trump] that says we ought to take 10 or 11 million people and pick them up, where the \u2014 I don\u2019t know where, we\u2019re gonna go in their homes, their apartments. We\u2019re gonna pick them up and we\u2019re gonna take them to the border and scream at them to get out of our country. Well that\u2019s just crazy. That is just crazy. We got people proposing health care reform that\u2019s gonna leave, I believe, millions of people without adequate health insurance. What has happened to our party? What has happened to the conservative movement?\n\nHere are some more choice bits of Kasich from the rally, as he rails against other candidates for offering no constructive ideas, but lots of irresponsible promises that would wreck the country.\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t we grow up?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we get a reality check on what the heck needs to be done in this country?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "On the eve of the next Republican debate, the Ohio governor and GOP presidential candidate declared that his party urgently needs a 'reality check.'", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The National Memo", "description": "On the eve of the next Republican debate, the Ohio governor and GOP presidential candidate declared that his party urgently needs a 'reality check.'", "title": "Kasich Slams Carson And Trump: 'Do You Know How Crazy This Election Is?'", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://www.nationalmemo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/2015-10-27-john-kasich-crazy-election-ohio-capitol-blog-640.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.nationalmemo.com/kasich-slams-carson-and-trump-do-you-know-how-crazy-this-election-is/", "type": "article"}, "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2015-10-27T17:53:31-04:00", "p": {"domain_verify": "d3b005556643b373e87ddd5d6617469e"}, "fb": {"admins": 100004458014669}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NationalMemo", "section": "Politics", "tag": "Politics", "published_time": "2015-10-27T17:53:31-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "2016, ben carson, donald trump, john kasich, ohio, politics, news, democrats, republicans, elections, nation, presidential election"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2c5a\"", "article_summary": "\u201cBut you know, I want to let you all know: Do you know how crazy this election is?\u201d he said, to laughter from the crowd of his local supporters.\nWe got people proposing health care reform that\u2019s gonna leave, I believe, millions of people without adequate health insurance.\nWell that\u2019s just crazy.\nYou know, what I say to them is, why don\u2019t we have no taxes?\nWe got one guy [Donald Trump] that says we ought to take 10 or 11 million people and pick them up, where the \u2014 I don\u2019t know where, we\u2019re gonna go in their homes, their apartments."}
