He was never charged. He would go on to win the Heisman Trophy a week later, and have another star moment with Florida State\u2019s baseball team after football season ended.\n\nBut the entire shameful ordeal may have provoked at least one positive outcome: the Tallahassee Police Department is in the process of reviewing its sexual assault policies, and aims to revise them to avoid repeating these egregious and negligent errors.\n\nFrom the New York Times:\n\n[Tallahassee Police Chief Michael] DeLeo said in an interview that his department was working on its sexual assault complaint policy with the advocacy group End Violence Against Women International. \u201cThey\u2019re looking at our procedures, how we document things, to make them better,\u201d he said. The chief did not offer a timetable as to when recommendations might be carried out. \u201cWe completely review them until we\u2019re all comfortable with it,\u201d he said. At a community forum organized by Ms. Baldwin on Wednesday, major players in the local criminal justice system, including Chief DeLeo; William N. Meggs, the state attorney who investigated the Winston case; and Florida State\u2019s police chief, David Perry, heard experts on sex crime investigations emphasize the importance of prosecuting sexual assaults based on the evidence, not the likelihood of conviction. [Executive director of the Refuge House, a service provider for victims of sexual assault Meg] Baldwin said that among those women in the area who had reported assaults to local law enforcement, most became discouraged with the process. Only 20 percent of sexual assaults reported to the prosecutor\u2019s office resulted in arrests, charges and trial or plea, she said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Tallahassee police got everything wrong during the Winston case.
