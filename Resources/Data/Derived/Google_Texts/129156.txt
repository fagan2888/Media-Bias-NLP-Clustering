The Employers Council on Flexible Compensation is calling for the repeal of the Affordable Care Act’s 40% excise tax and, at the very least, working for a fix to the loophole that includes individual contributions to HSAs and FSAs from the tax’s calculation.

Qualified contributions to flex spending plans are intended to be a pretax savings for insured workers, who often are incentivized to contribute to them with matching funds from their employers. Yet as the ACA is written, it’s possible that those contributions could trigger the threshold that puts an employer in Cadillac-tax territory.
