Jury deliberations in the trial of a Jersey City man charged with aggravated assault and other offenses after he was shot in the face by a police officer will continue next week after the jury yesterday asked for the playback of testimony from the trial.

At 2:30 p.m., two-and-a-half hours into deliberating, the panel asked Hudson County Superior Court Judge Mitzy Galis-Menendez to replay the testimony of State Police Detective Rebecca Velez, who conducted phone taps on Kwadir Felton, 22, who is charged in the Jan. 10, 2010 incident.

The phone taps include conversations between Felton and an alleged drug kingpin. During one conversation, Felton said he “has a brick in the backyard.” When asked if he sold some of it, Felton replied, “Nah, still got two bundles left.”

In response to the tapes, Felton has said he “never

possessed any drugs” and was “just aware of what was around.”

Felton is charged with pointing a loaded handgun at Jersey City Police Sgt. Thomas McVicar, who was in a vehicle on Dwight Street working undercover as part of a multiagency operation.

McVicar then shot Felton in the face when, authorities say, he heard a live round click into the chamber of the gun. Felton testified that he had no gun.

Felton, who lost sight in both eyes as a result of his injuries, was one of 46 people arrested in Operation Wetlands.

The jury asked that Velez’s lengthy, seven-hour testimony be played back so they could “sort through other evidence” in the trial.

The deliberations will resume Wednesday with Judge Paul DePascale presiding because Galis-Menendez is on a one-week absence.
