It\u2019s a threat to our football-playing kids, too.\n\nAnd that\u2019s a strong argument for any football lover (or parent of one) to see this film, which is anchored by a sensitive, understated performance by Will Smith as the real-life forensic pathologist who earned the NFL\u2019s animosity for shining a torch on the problem in Pittsburgh, home of the revered Steelers.\n\nThe film, directed and written by Peter Landesman, may suffer from an overly simplistic, sometimes sermonizing script that could have used some sharp editing. But it\u2019s to be admired for bringing a truly important issue to the big screen \u2014 one we hate to hear about, perhaps, but isn\u2019t going to go away no matter how much we in this football-mad country try to avoid it.\n\nWe first get to know Dr. Bennet Omalu, a Nigerian immigrant, in the autopsy room, where he has the strange habit of speaking to the corpses he\u2019s cutting into, asking them questions. He wants their help, in deducing how they died. This approach endears him to some colleagues while antagonizing others.\n\nOne day, a beloved former Steeler ends up on Omalu\u2019s table: Mike Webster \u2014 \u201cIron Mike\u201d \u2014 who died at only 50 after his last years were plagued by dementia. Omalu wonders why a high-level athlete would experience such a rapid deterioration. Ignoring colleagues\u2019 pleas to leave the case alone, Omalu orders testing of Webster\u2019s brain, at his own expense. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m looking for,\u201d he tells his skeptical but supportive boss, Cyril Wecht (a wisecracking Albert Brooks.)\n\nWhat he discovers is shocking: Webster\u2019s brain has been ravaged, a result of repeated blows over his long career \u2014 some 70,000 hits, Omalu estimates. He co-authors an article in a medical journal outlining his findings that Webster and others like him suffer from CTE (chronic traumatic encephalopathy). He thinks the NFL will be glad to know, so it can better help its athletes.\n\nWell, he\u2019s wrong. There\u2019s been some controversy over whether the \u201cConcussion\u201d filmmakers may have deleted scenes to mollify the NFL, but the NFL certainly does not look good here. Rather than welcome Omalu\u2019s findings, the league and its representatives seek to discredit him. Wecht tries to explain this to an oblivious Omalu, who doesn\u2019t watch football (or even turn on the TV): \u201cYou\u2019re going to war with a corporation that owns a day of the week \u2014 the same day the church used to own.\u201d\n\nOr, as former Steeler doctor Julian Bailes (Alec Baldwin) tells him: \u201cYou gave their biggest boogeyman a name.\u201d Bailes has watched a string of players die under tragic circumstances, including the suicides of Junior Seau in 2012 and Dave Duerson a year earlier. (Duerson\u2019s family, incidentally, has publicly disputed how Duerson is portrayed in the film.) He turns into a crucial ally of Omalu\u2019s.\n\nMuch of the credit here goes to Smith: He masters Omalu\u2019s Nigerian accent in a convincing, unshowy manner, and remains hugely watchable throughout. When Omalu goes to a nightclub \u2014 not his usual territory \u2014 to dance with a new lady friend who will eventually become his wife, Smith makes Omalu\u2019s social shyness believable \u2014 for a minute, you forget that this is the hugely charismatic Will Smith. Baldwin is effective, too, though his own accent is uneven. As Omalu\u2019s future wife, the gorgeous Gugu Mbatha-Raw is touching but seriously underused \u2014 and saddled with more heavy-handed lines than she deserves.\n\nIt is she, though, who points out a deep truth to Omalu that he hasn\u2019t yet seen: Football, she tells him, is a beautiful game. Indeed it is. But it also has a dark, troubling side which many have been loath to acknowledge, and that\u2019s a simple reason that \u201cConcussion\u201d is a worthy enterprise indeed.\n\n\u201cConcussion,\u201d a Sony Pictures release, is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association of America \u201cfor thematic material including some disturbing images, and language.\u201d Running time: 123 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four.\n\n___\n\nMPAA definition of PG-13: Parents strongly cautioned.
