Harders Park in Panama City for the annual Haunted Hayride.\n\nThis is the sixth year the county has hosted the hayride and family friendly event. There were games, prizes and candy for younger visitors, too.\n\nSome of the first people in line said they had been there at 4 o'clock. The ticket booth opened at 5:30 and visitors began filling in line. Volunteers said they take riders so long as there are still people waiting to ride. One volunteer estimated they might be working until 1 in the morning because of how large the night's crowd was.\n\nThe trail is a one mile long ride through the park's wooded walking trail.\n\nProceeds from the event will go to charity. County officials said last year they raised more than $18 thousand for charity.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "This is the sixth year the county has hosted the hayride and family friendly event.
