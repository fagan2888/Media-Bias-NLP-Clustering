Gusty winds and difficult access frustrated crews trying to fight the fire, which was reported late Saturday afternoon, according to a news release from the Northwest Colorado Fire Management Unit. The fire\u2019s cause has not been determined.\n\nFirefighters\u2019 priority is to protect Elk Springs, which is northwest of the fire, as well as nearby oil and gas facilities and major power lines.\n\nCrews on Saturday also fought other new small fires in the region while continuing to patrol the 20,690-acre Alkali fire northwest of Craig. The northwest fire unit expects full containment by Sunday of that fire, which was reported Wednesday.\n\nOther fires were burning Saturday within the Colorado National Monument, along the Colorado-Utah state line.\n\nThe monument\u2019s two fully contained fires, both on the Utah side, are the 4.7-acre Island Park fire, near Rainbow Park, and the tiny Quarry fire. That one was controlled at one-tenth of an acre near an area called Orchid Draw. Both began burning Friday.\n\nFirefighters\u2019 main concern, though, was the Hog Canyon fire, which also started Friday and grew to 76 acres on the Yampa Plateau in Utah.\n\nA news release said the crews fighting Hog Canyon included five smoke jumpers, three engines and a 20-person crew from Gila National Forest in New Mexico, with another crew on order from Lewis and Clark National Forest in Montana.\n\nHumidity overnight Friday and quick response from several agencies aided all three efforts, the National Park Service says.\n\nCrews also were monitoring a new blaze, called the Round Top Fire, which was reported Saturday. It was burning on two-tenths of an acre in steep terrain on the Colorado side.\n\nThe Park Service says none of the fires have threatened monument visitors or structures, and all services were open.\n\nJon Murray: 303-954-1405, jmurray@denverpost.com or twitter.com/JonMurray", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Crews fight new fires in Dinosaur National Monument, Elk Springs", "title": "Crews fight new fires in Dinosaur National Monument, Elk Springs", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/07/26/crews-fight-new-fires-in-dinosaur-national-monument-elk-springs/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-26T21:07:14+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-26T21:07:14+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9bb9\"", "article_summary": "Fire crews on Saturday contained two of four blazes in remote areas of the Dinosaur National Monument, while fighting new fires elsewhere in northwest Colorado.\nOther fires were burning Saturday within the Colorado National Monument, along the Colorado-Utah state line.\nHumidity overnight Friday and quick response from several agencies aided all three efforts, the National Park Service says.\nThe Park Service says none of the fires have threatened monument visitors or structures, and all services were open.\nThe largest new fire, at 300 acres, is near Elk Springs on a mix of federal, state and private land."}
