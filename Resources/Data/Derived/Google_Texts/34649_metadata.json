The Florida Department of Children and Families say they were actually investigating the man weeks before the mass shooting in Bell. So, in the wake of the deadly rampage, could lawmakers be considering another DCF legislative fix?\n\nAbout a week ago, Don Spirit shot his 28-year-old daughter Sarah and her six kids ranging in age from about three months old baby to 11-years-old.\n\nAfter calling 911 and warning the operator he would commit suicide when Gilchrist County Sheriff\u2019s deputies arrived on the scene, Don Spirit followed through and shot himself at his Bell home.\n\n\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d said Spirit, heard in the recently released 911 call. \u201cI just shot my daughter and shot all my grandkids, and I\u2019ll be sitting on my step, and when you get here, I\u2019m going to shoot myself.\u201d\n\n\u201cFirst deputy on the scene made contact with the subject who alter committed suicide. Deputies searched the residence which revealed multiple victims with apparent gunshot wounds inside the residence,\u201d confirmed Sheriff Robert Schultz, following the incident.\n\nThe day after the shooting, Governor Rick Scott visited the north Florida town. And, speaking to reporters following a Cabinet meeting Tuesday, he said he\u2019s still in contact with authorities in Bell.\n\n\u201cI spoke to the Sheriff, the superintendent, and the principal yesterday to see if there\u2019s anything they needed from the state,\u201d said Scott. \u201cBoth the superintendent and the principal said there\u2019s been a lot of grievance counselors that have come to the school because those children were going to an elementary school there and it happened after they came back from school that day.\u201d\n\nAs details continue to unfold, it\u2019s been discovered that two weeks before the shooting, someone had called the Florida Department of Children and Families\u2019 child abuse hotline to complain that adults in the home were using drugs in front of the kids\u2014a claim that state child welfare officials say they had been investigating.\n\nIn addition, officials say both Don Spirit and his daughter were the focus of several past abuse and neglect investigations.\n\nNow, Governor Rick Scott says he has the agency looking into it.\n\n\u201cRight now, we ought to be praying for the family. We ought to be doing everything we can for all the survivors in the community. But, then do exactly what we\u2019re doing and do a thorough investigation to understand what happened because we don\u2019t want this to happen in our state again,\u201d he added.\n\nAnd, Stuart Republican Representative Gayle Harrell agrees. She was in charge of this year\u2019s effort in the House to overhaul DCF, after a series of investigative Miami Herald reports outlined a number of child-abuse related deaths that occurred under the agency\u2019s supervision.\n\nThe massive overhaul includes hiring more child protective investigators and putting together a child death\u2019s website. It also created a team to conduct an investigation following any child death to determine the root cause of the child abuse death and report their findings.\n\n\u201cA good example of the change that has happened is we have this Rapid Response Team out there doing the investigation, and so we should have within in the next week or so as to what exactly went on and what went wrong. It will help us make decisions and DCF make decision as to where to go from here,\u201d said Harrell.\n\nStill, she says moving forward, she expects there will be a lot hearings when the legislature next convenes, starting with committee hearings in January.\n\nBut, she says for now, she\u2019s taking a wait-and-see approach as to what shakes out from the DCF probe, especially given the new law reforming the system just took effect months ago.\n\n\u201cAnd, if the new law is not going to address that, we need to learn about that and perhaps take further steps, but let\u2019s see what shakes out of the investigation. And, also let\u2019s see how the changes in the new law could have had an impact. I think they will have a significant impact, and it makes me even more determined as we go down this road of reform in changing this system and making sure the safety of the child is paramount,\u201d she added.\n\nIn addition to DCF, local authorities are also conducting their own probe. That includes how Don Spirit had a gun with a felony record.\n\nThe elder Spirit had a troubled past, which includes serving time in prison for accidentally fatally shooting his eight-year-old son in the head during a hunting trip in 2001.\n\nFor more news updates, follow Sascha Cordner on Twitter: @SaschaCordner.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "Listen \n        Listening...", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/wake-bell-mass-shooting-could-fla-be-considering-another-dcf-legislative-fix", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/shared/npr/styles/medium/nprshared/201409/351848931.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Listen \n        Listening...", "title": "In Wake Of Bell Mass Shooting, Could Fla.
