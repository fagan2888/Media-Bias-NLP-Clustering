Everything whacky and hateful is welcome there and each year conservative religious leaders and politicians parade their bigotry before their peers and their followers, and for the entire world to see.\n\nFrankly, its embarrassing for the rest of us, because these people claim to be movers and shakers in both our society and government (and all too often, are) and here they are two centuries or more behind the rest of the world.\n\nIt is difficult to believe much thought goes into any of the speeches given, as though each is vying with the last to attain new levels of stupidity. What we saw at this year\u2019s summit was rampant American exceptionalism fueled by a Church militant targeting everything outside itself as evil. Let me put it this way: FRC Senior Vice President Rob Schwarzwalder sounds pretty stupid now complaining about all the mean things he says liberals say about Republicans.\n\nLook at a few examples, courtesy of Right Wing Watch. We will start with the Church militant and American exceptionalism, since the two seem to be linked in the conservative brain:\n\nThe FRCs own retired general, Jerry Boykin, was too extreme even for George W. Bush, but he\u2019s not too extreme for Tony Perkins and the Republican base. Says Right Wing Watch of his appearance:\n\nBoykin was his blunt self, asserting, \u201cwe are in a culture war today like America has never been\u201d and complaining that the problem was with the church in general and with \u201cChristians in name only\u201d in particular. \u201cThe majority of the Christians in America today are dead, asleep,\u201d he groused. \u201cThey are not involved in what\u2019s going on in our culture. They\u2019re not engaged in this culture war. They are not putting their faith into action.\u201d He said it was the church that brought about the Revolutionary War and the abolition of slavery through the Civil War. When he looks at America today, he said, \u201cThere is no other solution to our ills than for the church to wake up, get off your dead behinds and get in this culture war that we\u2019re involved in.\u201d\n\nWow, they haven\u2019t woken up yet? Could\u2019ve fooled me. Hate to think now nasty these people will be when they wake up. I wouldn\u2019t hold out hope of them being any smarter, however.\n\nAnd then we\u2019ve got E.W. Jackson, the lunatic fringer who wants to be Lt. Governor of Virginia. Jackson had a twofold message: that he\u2019s not crazy, just persecuted as part of \u201ca growing hostility against Christianity, a growing hostility against those of us who believe in the Bible as truth.\u201d\n\nI am certain all the people the United States has crushed underfoot on its way to empire might disagree about just how great we are and I find it very difficult to believe that anyone in the would agree with Jackson\u2019s characterization if he and his lunatic friends ever get in control of the country. The world\u2019s only hope at that point will be to gang up on the U.S.A. and destroy it before the U.S.A. destroys them in some ill-conceived Crusade to spread Jesus\u2019 love to every corner of the world.\n\nRick Santorum, who perhaps best embodies the low intellectual output of the Values Voter Summit, found a way to blame the French Revolution for contraception, asserting that the ACA\u2019s contraception mandate is \u201ca descendant of the French Revolution.\u201d This led Kyle Mantyla of Right WIng Watch to say, \u201cWe\u2019re not even going to bother trying to explain how this works because, frankly, we don\u2019t understand.\u201d And to be fair, I don\u2019t understand either. I\u2019ll just let \u201cFrothy\u201d Santorum speak for himself:\n\nIf we are lucky, Michele Bachmann will spend next year\u2019s Values Voter Summit becoming intimately familiar with broom handles but for this year we\u2019re stuck with her mindless attacks on Obamacare, quipping that it is \u201cegregious system\u201d that \u201cwill ultimately be known as DeathCare.\u201d\n\nOoooh. I don\u2019t know if she was going for some Star Wars reference there or not but I\u2019m certain she thought she was clever. After all, she thinks her husband isn\u2019t gay.\n\nShe also thinks Obamacare will turn the U.S. into a \u201cpolice state\u201d (I\u2019ve got news for her: it was a Republican, George W. Bush, who gave us the biggest push in that direction). She said Obamacare is \u201cthe battle of our time\u201d but I suspect by this time next year she might be thinking broom handles are the battle of our time.\n\nJust sayin\u2019.\n\nAnd of course, it wouldn\u2019t be a Values Voter Summit without gay bashing, which brings us to Sandy Rios, who says \u201cMillions of gay men and lesbians are caught in a powerful web of deceit that is breaking hearts.\u201d She also accused our public schools of responsibility for an \u201cocean of propaganda on the homosexual issue.\u201d\n\nRight. Because my 9-year-old comes home from school every day to say how badly he wants to be gay.\n\nThis is a real face-palm moment. If only Rios would look in a mirror when she says stupid things like this.\n\nLook, this is ironic coming from somebody who practices deceit as a profession, and at a place \u2013 the Values Voter Summit \u2013 which is founded upon the dissemination of deceit.\n\nFinally, I want to give dishonorable mention to a piece of white trash known as Gary Bauer, a guy who says China ought to clean up its human rights record while thinking it\u2019s great if America gets rid of its human rights. Bauer spent his allotted time at the summit dishonoring Sandra Fluke. Bauer said that when \u201ca president praises a promiscuous co-ed,\u201d it is \u201cthe definition of civilization decline\u201d:\n\nSo there you have it: Another Valueless Voters Summit brought to you by the Big Three: Hatred, Bigotry and Intolerance. These people want to create an America founded not on the spirit of equality and freedom, but on the premise that some people are less equal and less free than others. They want a nation that, far from prohibiting laws establishing religion, mandates one religion \u2013 their religion -for all.\n\nAnd then they want to export this faux freedom to other countries and, with any luck, trigger the End Times.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t take a third-grade knowledge of American history to know that this is not what the United States Constitution is all about. These people talk about American exceptionalism but as they are violently opposed to everything that is American \u2013 because the Constitution defines what it means to be American \u2013 what they are really preaching is theocracy and a warped biblical exceptionalism.\n\nAnd every year they remind us why we need to keep them out of office. I guess after we\u2019re all done throwing up we should thank them for that. The line forms to the left.\n\nJust sayin\u2019.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Trending at the Values Voters Summit: when \"a president praises a promiscuous co-ed,\" it is \"the definition of civilization decline\"", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Hrafnkell Haraldsson", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "Trending at the Values Voters Summit: when \"a president praises a promiscuous co-ed,\" it is \"the definition of civilization decline\"", "title": "The Valueless Voters Summit Recap", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2013/10/12/valueless-voters-summit-recap.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Michele-Bachmann-Values-Voter-Summit.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-10-12T08:01:57+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Featured News,Issues,Republican Party,america,American Exceptionalism,Ethnocentrism,Gary Bauer,Jerry Boykin,Jesus,Michele Bachmann,Rick Santorum,Rob Schwarzwalder,sandra fluke,Sandy Rios,Tony Perkins,United States,Values Voter Summit,William G.
