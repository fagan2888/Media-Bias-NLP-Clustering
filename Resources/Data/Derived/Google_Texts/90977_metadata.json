With the increased number of codes, physicians are concerned they will spend more time staring at a computer screen and looking up appropriate codes.\n\nFox News cut to a reporter in Chicago who spoke with a podiatrist -- not a physician -- who said she would go from seeing 30 to 40 patients a day under ICD-9 to 10 per day under ICD-10. I doubt the reporter pressed the podiatrist on that assertion.\n\nAlthough the reporter didn't directly link ICD-10 to the ACA, the chyron at the bottom of the Fox News screen throughout much of the video reads \"Concerns Over Rollout of New Obamacare Med Coding System.\"\n\nHere's the problem. The move to ICD-10, which has already been delayed to give providers more time to adjust, has nothing to do with the ACA. \"Obamacare\" didn't bring this about or set this in motion.\n\nCheck out the Fox News clip here.\n\nPay and Practice is a blog by David Pittman for readers with an interest in health policy.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "David  Pittman", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.medpagetoday.com/PracticeManagement/InformationTechnology/44006", "image": "http://clf1.medpagetoday.com/assets/images/defaultLede.png", "description": "Fox News linked the upcoming move to the ICD-10 coding system with the Affordable Care Act during a recent broadcast.
