They would be less expensive and have higher deductibles than the bronze, silver, gold and platinum plans currently available.\n\nBegich says he\u2019s been talking with small business owners and individuals who want more affordable coverage options under the new law.\n\n\u201cWhat I keep hearing from people is make sure the choices are there but those core benefits aren\u2019t taken away, preventive care and making sure people don\u2019t get denied because of preexisting conditions and carrying your kid to the age of 26. Very important pieces of the puzzle.\u201d\n\nSome consumers would be able to use subsidies to pay for copper plans. The law currently allows people under age 30 to buy higher deductible, catastrophic plans but they aren\u2019t eligible for subsidies.\n\nBegich says having another option is especially important for a state like Alaska, where health care premiums are so high.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act requirements and benefits have generally made those premiums even more expensive. Begich says he doesn\u2019t know how cheap the copper plans would be.\n\n\u201cIt will definitely be less than the lowest cost bronze plan, there\u2019s no question about that, how much less it\u2019s hard to say yet until they design the detail of it,\u201d Begich said. \u201cBut right now the law prevents that from happening so we want to fix that so it allows it to happen.\u201d\n\nBegich sent a letter outlining the idea to President Obama on Tuesday.\n\nRelated articles\n\nComments", "article_metadata": {"category": "Federal Government,Health,Recent News", "description": "Senator Mark Begich is proposing a change to the Affordable Care Act that would make cheaper insurance options available.", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Annie Feidt, APRN - Anchorage", "og": {"site_name": "KTOO", "description": "Senator Mark Begich is proposing a change to the Affordable Care Act that would make cheaper insurance options available.", "title": "Begich proposing more insurance options for ACA", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 477, "identifier": "http://www.ktoo.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Alaska-Plan-Levels.jpg", "height": 378}, "url": "http://www.ktoo.org/2013/11/20/begich-proposing-more-insurance-options-for-aca/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Senator Mark Begich is proposing a change to the Affordable Care Act that would make cheaper insurance options available.", "creator": "@KTOOpubmedia", "image": "http://www.ktoo.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Alaska-Plan-Levels.jpg", "title": "Begich proposing more insurance options for ACA", "site": "@KTOOpubmedia", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "nid": 74039, "fb": {"admins": "100000451568550,1057430445,64202921,5701326,100009904184202,100000548846198,100000571087086,100005265339889,657797481,698475886,100002322833863,529595225,1074192195", "app_id": 129011767246539}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.ktoo.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/cropped-KTOO_favicon-270x270.png", "keywords": "Affordable Care Act,Copper Plan,Expanded Consumer Choice Act,Mark Begich,President Obama", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ktoopublicmedia", "section": "Federal Government", "tag": "President Obama", "published_time": "2013-11-20T07:01:41-08:00"}, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda93b\"", "article_summary": "Senator Mark Begich is proposing a change to the Affordable Care Act that would make cheaper insurance options available.\nBegich says having another option is especially important for a state like Alaska, where health care premiums are so high.\nVery important pieces of the puzzle.\u201dSome consumers would be able to use subsidies to pay for copper plans.\nBegich says he\u2019s been talking with small business owners and individuals who want more affordable coverage options under the new law.\nBegich wants to call them copper plans."}
