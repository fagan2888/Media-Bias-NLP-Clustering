Hafþór Julius Björnsson may be known for his work on “Game of Thrones,” but his strength has put him in the history books after breaking a 1,000-year-old record.

The man who plays Ser Gregor on the hit HBO show won the the 2015 World’s Strongest Viking competition, but added an accomplishment not seen in ages. The actor posted a picture of himself after carrying a giant wooden log that weighed 1,320 pounds, Muscle and Fitness Magazine reported.

“The legend of the Icelander Orm Storulfsson says that he walked three steps with this MONSTER WOODEN LOG. … It took 50 mere mortals to help him placing it on his back! After he took his third step his back broke under the enormous pressure and he was never the same after that! Well today my friends I made history!! As well as winning the title of The World’s Strongest Viking for the second time in a row I carried this MONSTER LOG 5 steps!” Mr. Björnsson wrote Tuesday.
