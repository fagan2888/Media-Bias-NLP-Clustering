They\u2019ve cooked and tasted fresh vegetables or distributed them free to their neighbors. Some have used power tools to build a large chicken coop for the 14 or so resident chickens that lay a dozen eggs per day in the summer.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe gardeners \u2014 some as young as 10 \u2014 are all part of an after-school program run by the nonprofit City of Dreams in the Bayview-Hunters Point neighborhood. The organization employs 32 kids from the area as junior gardeners, paying them $35 for completing eight gardening sessions. It\u2019s a modest stipend for anyone, but earning the cash gives an air of formality to kids like Zavion Gilbert, 15, who shows up regularly to work.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of like a job but it\u2019s teaching us a lot of stuff, too,\u201d says Zavion, who aspires to become a chef. \u201cI keep doing it because it got me more interested in life and healthy things. I want to work with vegetables and stuff.\u201d\n\nOn the day I visited, a handful of volunteers \u2014 U.S. Army veterans \u2014 were teaching Zavion and Dominique Brooks, 12, to drill wooden planks and assemble garden beds. The adult volunteers supervised Brooks and other teens as they cut a plastic sheet and inserted it into the bottom of a garden bed to prevent weeds from growing inside.\n\n\n\n\n\nDominique has participated in the garden since its inception over four years ago, and points proudly to the lemon, pomegranate and orange trees that she planted along the edges. A few of the trees are now about as tall as she is.\n\n\u201cThe garden is joyful,\u201d says Dominique, a middle schooler with long braided hair. \u201cIt helps me do more stuff, and it helps me learn. If I go to college and want to know more stuff about plants, I\u2019ll already know something because I started gardening at a young age.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says she likes being in the garden, in part because she considers it safer than hanging out in the streets nearby. She says she has witnessed shootings firsthand.\n\n\u201cOne day somebody got shot in front of the garden right there,\u201d recalls Dominique, pointing to the street. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know what to do. We didn\u2019t know it was coming.\u201d\n\nThe Bayview-Hunters Point area struggles with gang violence and poverty. The proportion of residents living at or below 200 percent poverty is 50 percent higher than for San Francisco as a whole.\n\n\u201cWhen you hang out in the neighborhood, you see the pressure that the families are under to just make it,\u201d says Cody Reynolds, 52, lead gardener in the project. \u201cThese kids come to us frustrated, upset. They are kids dealing with this violence that, as an adult, I have a hard time dealing with.\u201d\n\nReynolds is an artist who has lived in Bayview-Hunters Point for 20 years. He says most of those years he kept to himself and wasn\u2019t deeply engaged with the community. He dreaded the summers, when he says teens would break windows at his warehouse studio.\n\n\u201cI realized they didn\u2019t have any activities. They weren\u2019t being engaged to do better,\u201d says Reynolds.\n\nSo he tried a small experiment. An avid gardener for a long time, he would keep his \u201chands grounded\u201d by tending to plants in pots and tires. One day, a group of teens stopped by to try to sell him a bike. Instead, Reynolds offered them a job: to plant avocado and other trees in the neighborhood. He paid them a small amount out of his own pocket. It was a success.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe experience brewed a dream for him: to turn open spaces in Bayview-Hunters Point into orchards with fresh foods for residents, involving youth. This garden with the teens, at the Oakdale Community Center, is a first big step.\n\n\u201cWe are turning a food desert into a food forest. In the Bayview we have lots of sunshine and the right weather to grow everything from apples and pears to watermelon, squash and cucumbers,\u201d says Reynolds, while helping Mutee Algaaffar, 10, plant a large patch of strawberries.\n\n\u201cFor the kids, this is their nature and you see how they resonate here,\u201d he says. \u201cEveryone is a little calmer. It\u2019s just a natural place to be.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Community center engages local teens in growing food and sharing it with neighbors.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Teens in San Francisco's Bayview Find Haven in Garden\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2016\\/01\\/21\\/teens-in-san-franciscos-bayview-find-haven-in-garden\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2016-01-21 11:45:45\",\"mod_date\":\"2016-01-22 13:01:15\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":135966,\"author_id\":\"8659\",\"author_name\":\"Farida Jhabvala Romero\",\"author_display_name\":\"Farida Jhabvala Romero\",\"tags\":[\"Children's Health\",\"food\",\"News\"],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2016\\/01\\/watering.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "Community center engages local teens in growing food and sharing it with neighbors.", "title": "Teens in San Francisco\u2019s Bayview Find Haven in Garden", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2016/01/21/teens-in-san-franciscos-bayview-find-haven-in-garden/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2016/01/RS18025_IMG_9292.JPG-qut.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@faridajhabvala"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "children\\'s health,food,news", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The gardeners \u2014 some as young as 10 \u2014 are all part of an after-school program run by the nonprofit City of Dreams in the Bayview-Hunters Point neighborhood.\nThe experience brewed a dream for him: to turn open spaces in Bayview-Hunters Point into orchards with fresh foods for residents, involving youth.\nWe didn\u2019t know it was coming.\u201dThe Bayview-Hunters Point area struggles with gang violence and poverty.\nThis garden with the teens, at the Oakdale Community Center, is a first big step.\n\u201cOne day somebody got shot in front of the garden right there,\u201d recalls Dominique, pointing to the street."}
