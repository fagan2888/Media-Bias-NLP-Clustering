One remarkable aspect of this whining is that the nasty things aren\u2019t really all that nasty. Saying that the Koch brothers are using their wealth to promote a political agenda that will make them even wealthier is a substantive claim, not character assassination; it\u2019s not at all the same as, say, suggesting that Hillary Clinton is a murderer. Yet the Kochs and Perkinses act as if this kind of thing were utterly vile, an attack on their liberty.\n\nThe other remarkable thing is the instant escalation of hurt feelings into a Godwin\u2019s Law violation. You see, liberals criticize the Kochs; that makes them just like Hitler and Stalin, who murdered their opponents.\n\nBut wait, there\u2019s more. What I\u2019ve been hearing from Koch defenders is that people like me have no standing to ridicule billionaires. You see, I sometimes say sarcastic things about the arguments of people who disagree with me, and even question their motives when they say things I consider obviously wrong. And that\u2019s just like comparing such people to Hitler.\n\nThe thing is, I don\u2019t think the crybaby thing is an act, put on for strategic purposes. I think it\u2019s real. Billionaires really are feeling vulnerable despite their wealth and power, or perhaps because of it. And the apparatchiks serving the .01 percent are deeply insecure, culturally and intellectually, so that ridicule cuts deep.\n\nIt\u2019s kind of sad, really \u2013 but also more than a bit scary: When great power goes along with fragile egos, seriously bad things can happen.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20140404104748, "BN": "krugman", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/krugman", "DISPLAYDATE": "April 4, 2014", "keywords": "Uncategorized", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/krugman/Equivalences ( 20140404 )", "PT": "Blogs", "SCG": "krugman", "sourceApp": "blogs", "twitter": {"description": "The just-likers of the right.", "title": "Equivalences", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/04/equivalences/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "site": "@NytimesKrugman", "card": "summary"}, "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/krugman/post", "description": "The just-likers of the right.", "CG": "Opinion", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "April 4, 2014", "article": {"published_time": 1396622868, "author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/paulkrugman/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Uncategorized", "modified_time": "2014-04-04T14:47:48-04:00"}, "utime": 20140404144748, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20140404, "pdate": 20140404, "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Paul Krugman Blog", "description": "The just-likers of the right.", "title": "Equivalences", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/04/equivalences/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/04/equivalences/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "Equivalences", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc0d1\"", "article_summary": "One remarkable aspect of this whining is that the nasty things aren\u2019t really all that nasty.\nWhat I\u2019ve been hearing from Koch defenders is that people like me have no standing to ridicule billionaires.\nYou see, I sometimes say sarcastic things about the arguments of people who disagree with me, and even question their motives when they say things I consider obviously wrong.\nThere are definitely times when it seems that our winner-take-all society is also a whiner-take-all society; it\u2019s really amazing how quick billionaires are to portray themselves as victims because some people say nasty things about them.\nBillionaires really are feeling vulnerable despite their wealth and power, or perhaps because of it."}
