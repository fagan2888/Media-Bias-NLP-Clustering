(Steve Helber/AP)\n\nDonald Trump spent part of last weekend wooing former Virginia attorney general Ken Cuccinelli II, but the conservative heartthrob wasn\u2019t ready to commit.\n\nCuccinelli had spent months on end campaigning across the country for another GOP presidential hopeful, Sen. Ted Cruz (Texas).\n\nHe got a call from Trump\u2019s campaign manager about a week ago, about the time Cruz suspended his campaign and Trump became the presumptive nominee. A long round of phone tag ensued. Cuccinelli and Trump\u2019s campaign manager Corey Lewandowski finally connected over the weekend \u2014 at a moment when the manager was at Trump\u2019s side.\n\n\u201cHe happened to be with Donald Trump. He put him on briefly,\u201d Cuccinelli told The Washington Post on Wednesday.\n\nAnd what did The Donald say to Cooch?\n\n\u201cKind of a, \u2018Rah, Rah. We want you on the team,\u2019 \u201d Cuccinelli said. \u201cThat was nice of him. But I\u2019m still waiting for the reason [to support Trump]. . . . Ted Cruz has fought and bled for the things l believe.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen Donald Trump lay out and stick to a set of policy issues that reflect the core beliefs that I hold. Now, he\u2019s got time to do that. But given his history of flopping all over the place, he\u2019s gonna have to have a way to convince people like me that even when he lays out his positions on something, we can have confidence he can stick to it when the going gets rough.\u201d\n\nThat said, Cuccinelli said that he appreciated the outreach and that he expects to vote for Trump.\n\n\u201cI anticipate voting for him,\u201d Cuccinelli said. \u201cBut I am gonna spend the next two months before the convention . . . watching and listening.\u201d\n\nCuccinelli, who won conservative hearts as attorney general for brash legal action against \u201cObamacare\u201d and other forms of perceived federal overreach, is more than just a high-profile Cruz surrogate. Since that campaign folded, he has tried to rally Cruz supporters to a new cause: ensuring that the party platform reflects their conservative views.\n\nCuccinelli spent Monday night at Cruz\u2019s Houston campaign headquarters, where he spoke via conference call to state leadership teams and supporters who had been elected delegates to the Republican National Convention in July. He encouraged them to make their presence felt at the gathering.\n\nHe said Cruz supporters are under no illusions that he could emerge as the nominee, a scenario that seemed possible when it looked like Trump might not lock up the nomination before the convention.\n\n\u201cThis is not some sneaky, \u2018We\u2019re-gonna-nominate-Ted-Cruz, ha-ha\u2019 kind of play,\u201d Cuccinelli said.\n\nBut they do have the power to shape the platform, he said.\n\n\u201cIn this stage of the contest, we have elected more hard-core conservative delegates to go to the convention than would have ever happened in previous cycles at this point,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy not keep the conservative piece of this going, even though it isn\u2019t going to have anything to do with the nomination, and try to achieve some of the goals we\u2019ve had?\u201d\n\nChief among those goals: Getting rid of an RNC rule that could make it possible for the establishment to install a \u201csavior\u201d candidate over a grass-roots favorite.\n\n[Cruz talks up an RNC rule that would keep Kasich out of the convention]\n\nRule 40b requires that candidates win total delegate majorities in eight states or more in order to be nominated. The RNC hastily came up with it in 2012, after then-Rep. Ron Paul of Texas nearly racked up enough wins to be nominated.\n\nCuccinelli said his goal is to \u201cmove the rules of the Republican Party away from RNC- centric power and toward the grass roots.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Trump woos Ken Cuccinelli, but the conservative hero has doubts.", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/laura.vozzella", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Trump woos Ken Cuccinelli, but the conservative hero has doubts.", "title": "Trump to Cuccinelli: \u2018We want you on the team\u2019", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/trump-to-cuccinelli-we-want-you-on-the-team/2016/05/11/069aa9a0-1793-11e6-aa55-670cabef46e0_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/05/11/Local-Politics/Images/VA_GOP_State_Convention-0ddf2-548.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@LVozzella"}, "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "va politics, ppinclude, virginia politics, donald trump, ken cuccinelli, 2016", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/laura.vozzella"}, "eomportal-uuid": "069aa9a0-1793-11e6-aa55-670cabef46e0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "va politics, ppinclude, virginia politics, donald trump, ken cuccinelli, 2016"}, "article_summary": "Cuccinelli and Trump\u2019s campaign manager Corey Lewandowski finally connected over the weekend \u2014 at a moment when the manager was at Trump\u2019s side.\nHe got a call from Trump\u2019s campaign manager about a week ago, about the time Cruz suspended his campaign and Trump became the presumptive nominee.\nCuccinelli had spent months on end campaigning across the country for another GOP presidential hopeful, Sen.
