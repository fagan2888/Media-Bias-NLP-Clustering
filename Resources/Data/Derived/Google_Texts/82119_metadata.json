Angus Peckham-Cooper/Dow Jones\n\nU.K. Prime Minister David Cameron needs to refocus his election campaign on his government\u2019s economic record ahead of the upcoming vote, said a notable Conservative Party backer and senior figure in London\u2019s financial-services industry.\n\nMichael Spencer, the head of big London brokerage firm ICAP PLC and chairman of the Conservative Foundation, said refocusing the party\u2019s campaign strategy is necessary if the prime minister wants to secure victory.\n\n\u201cI think if they can bring the debate back to the economy\u2026I think the credibility of the Conservatives, their existing track record\u2026I think David and crew can still do it,\u201d said Mr. Spencer, speaking Thursday on a panel hosted by Dow Jones Newswires/The Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe intervention comes as Mr. Cameron\u2019s center-right Conservatives are effectively neck and neck in the opinion polls with the opposition center-left Labour Party, in one of the tightest British elections in recent years. Opinion polls suggest neither party is likely to secure a majority when Britain goes to the polls on May 7, meaning one of them would need to form a minority government or a coalition with support from smaller parties.\n\nDavid Page, senior economist at AXA Investment Managers in London, said he believes that the best outcome for markets would be a minority government or some sort of coalition, as it would bring the main political parties back to the center of the political spectrum. Both parties have been pulled to their extremes by challenges from smaller parties.\n\n\u201cI think it could be a relatively stable mess,\u201d said Mr. Page, also speaking at the Thursday event. \u201cI think it could actually last for a lot longer\u201d than some are expecting, he added.\n\nWhile opinion polls remain in deadlock, analysts and commentators have noted that there recently has been positive momentum in favor of Labour leader Ed Miiband, whose personal popularity ratings have improved\u2014albeit from a very low base.\n\nBoth parties have made the economy a central part of their campaigns, but some businesses say this election presents a difficult choice for corporate Britain.\n\nSupport for the center-right Conservatives could usher Britain out of the European Union because Mr. Cameron has pledged\u2014if he wins the election\u2014to hold a referendum on whether the U.K. should exit. While businesses in Britain often complain about regulations that emanate from Brussels, many say they would fear losing unfettered access to the world\u2019s biggest economic grouping if it left the EU.\n\nBut backing Labour could lead to a series of market interventions, as its leader has promised to introduce measures such as freezing retail energy prices and forcing banks to sell off branches to encourage more competition.\n\nOn Europe, Mr. Spencer said he backs a key pledge by the Conservatives to hold a referendum in 2017 about whether the U.K. should remain as a member of the European Union. He said he would work to persuade the EU that it needs to reform, to focus on an economic growth agenda, but if that\u2019s not possible the U.K. might be better going it alone.\n\nHe described some EU proposals as damaging, such as an effort to limit compensation in banking which he said \u201cis positively ridiculous, positively absurd. It\u2019s actually disruptive.\u201d\n\nBut he played down fears that the City of London would be a big casualty of an EU exit. ICAP\u2019s business \u201cis so global we can shift the center of gravity of our business, if needed, elsewhere,\u201d he said, but the idea of moving to another European financial center such as Frankfurt or Paris \u201cis simply not a feasible one.\u201d\n\nHuw van Steenis, head of financial research at Morgan Stanley, at the event agreed there wouldn\u2019t be a huge exodus but that some banks from other parts of the world may decamp rather than face the hassle of managing two different regulatory systems.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have given an unnecessary leg up to somewhere else, probably Frankfurt,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron needs to refocus his election campaign on his government\u2019s economic record ahead of the upcoming vote, said a notable Conservative Party backer and senior figure in London's financial-services industry.", "title": "ICAP\u2019s Michael Spencer Calls on David Cameron to Focus U.K. Election Campaign on Economic Record", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/dispatch/2015/04/24/icaps-michael-spencer-calls-on-david-cameron-to-focus-election-campaign-on-economic-record/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-IB593_djtalk_P_20150424100727.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "US", "article.headline": "ICAP\u2019s Michael Spencer Calls on David Cameron to Focus U.K. Election Campaign on Economic Record", "description": "U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron needs to refocus his election campaign on his government\u2019s economic record ahead of the upcoming vote, said a notable Conservative Party backer and senior figure in London's financial-services industry.", "article_section": "US", "author": "Matthew Cowley", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Dispatch Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Dispatch", "article.summary": "U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron needs to refocus his election campaign on his government\u2019s economic record ahead of the upcoming vote, said a notable Conservative Party backer and senior figure in London's financial-services industry.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2015-04-24T14:18:07-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-141", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/dispatch/2015/04/24/icaps-michael-spencer-calls-on-david-cameron-to-focus-election-campaign-on-economic-record/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-DISPATCHB-4340", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "US", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron needs to refocus his election campaign on his government\u2019s economic record ahead of the upcoming vote, said a notable Conservative Party backer and senior figure in London's financial-services industry.", "title": "ICAP\u2019s Michael Spencer Calls on David Cameron to Focus U.K. Election Campaign on Economic Record", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/dispatch/2015/04/24/icaps-michael-spencer-calls-on-david-cameron-to-focus-election-campaign-on-economic-record/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-IB593_djtalk_P_20150424100727.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Dispatch", "article.id": "BL-DISPATCHB-4340", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-04-24T14:56:04-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd87a6\"", "article_summary": "Angus Peckham-Cooper/Dow JonesU.K. Prime Minister David Cameron needs to refocus his election campaign on his government\u2019s economic record ahead of the upcoming vote, said a notable Conservative Party backer and senior figure in London\u2019s financial-services industry.\nIt\u2019s actually disruptive.\u201dBut he played down fears that the City of London would be a big casualty of an EU exit.\nOn Europe, Mr. Spencer said he backs a key pledge by the Conservatives to hold a referendum in 2017 about whether the U.K. should remain as a member of the European Union.\n(Left to right): Thorold Barker, Editor, EMEA, The Wall Street Journal; David Page, Senior Economist, AXA Investment Managers; Michael Spencer, Group Chief Executive Officer, ICAP; Huw Van Steenis, Head of Financial Research, Morgan Stanley; Simon Nixon, Chief European Commentator for The Wall Street Journal.\nMichael Spencer, the head of big London brokerage firm ICAP PLC and chairman of the Conservative Foundation, said refocusing the party\u2019s campaign strategy is necessary if the prime minister wants to secure victory."}
