Senate To Decide\n\nWould Edward Snowden count as a journalist under the proposed \"shield\" law?\n\nFor the first time ever, Congress has crafted a piece of legislation that determines whether or not a person is a journalist, in a bill designed to give federal protection to journalists and bloggers from being forced to disclose the identities of their confidential sources. This would mean that before the government could ask a news organization or a journalist to identify their sources, it must first go to a federal judge, who would supervise any subpoenas or court orders for the information.\n\nBut the legislation comes with a catch. In order for a person to be protected under the bill, one must first meet the criteria for being termed a \u201cjournalist\u201d \u2014 and even then, journalists will not be protected in all situations.\n\nThough freedom of speech, which includes the printed word, is protected under the First Amendment, media shield laws are supposed to go above and beyond in terms of protecting a journalist from being forced to disclose confidential information and sources.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee passed the bill, the Free Flow of Information Act of 2013, on Thursday in a 13-5 vote. Though most states have their own media shield laws, they vary in terms of protections for reporters. If the legislation passes, this would be the first federal media shield law.\n\nAt the urging of Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the committee defined what they considered \u201cjournalism\u201d as well as who qualified to be labeled as a \u201cjournalist.\u201d Feinstein said legal protection should only be extended to \u201creal reporters\u201d and not a \u201c17-year-old\u201d with their own website.\n\nOriginally the bill would have covered all persons who \u201cinvestigates events and obtains material to disseminate news and information to the public.\u201d But this was altered as part of a compromise between the members of the committee.\n\n\u201cI think journalism has a certain tradecraft. It\u2019s a profession. I recognize that everyone can think they\u2019re a journalist,\u201d Feinstein said. \u201cI can\u2019t support it if everyone who has a blog has a special privilege \u2026 or if Edward Snowden were to sit down and write this stuff, he would have a privilege. I\u2019m not going to go there.\u201d\n\nFeinstein was one of a few Senate Judiciary Committee members who expressed concern about revealing classified information in the press.\n\nBy contrast, Sen. Patrick Leahy, (D-Vt.), chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said, \u201cOne of the things that protect democracy is the free flow of information,\u201d and added that the public learned valuable information about the NSA after Snowden released classified documents earlier this year.\n\nWhat is journalism? Who is a journalist?\n\nUnder the new legislation, protected journalists would include those who gather and report on news for \u201can entity or service that disseminates news and information,\u201d whether they be freelancers, part-time staff or student journalists. Journalists also have to have been employed for one year within the last 20 years or three months within the last five years.\n\nThe language the committee used in its definition of a journalist also allowed for a federal judge to extend the journalist protection legislation to any organization that proved it conducts \u201clegitimate news-gathering activities.\u201d What counts as \u201clegitimate\u201d news-gathering was not explicitly defined, however.\n\nThe federal legal protections for news outlets and media personnel will not be extended to organizations such as WikiLeaks, which discloses \u201cprimary-source documents \u2026 without authorization.\u201d Additionally, non-journalists who disclose information on Twitter, blogs or other social media sites will not be protected under the proposed federal media shield law.\n\nWhile the bill purports to protect journalists, it does not grant absolute privilege to any person or any organization. \u201cReal reporters\u201d will also be forced to share information if federal officials believe the information could stop or prevent crimes such as murder, kidnapping, child abduction, acts of terrorism or that otherwise cause significant harm to national security.\n\nSupporters of the legislation say the bill is likely to pass the Democrat-controlled Senate, but its fate remains uncertain in the Republican-led House. Opponents expressed concern that the bill did not take into consideration efforts to protect national security interests and unconstitutionally allowed the government to determine who is a journalist.\n\nThe Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press said that if the bill does become law, it \u201cgoes a long way toward ensuring that reporters will be protected from subpoenas for their confidential information and sources. \u2026 While is it not as inclusive as we would like, it is not nearly as limited in that area as previous attempts at a federal shield law have been.\u201d\n\nSen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) also applauded the bill, saying, \u201cWe\u2019re closer than we\u2019ve ever been before to passing a strong and tough media shield bill. Thanks to important bipartisan compromises, we\u2019ve put together a strong bill that balances the need for national security with that of a free press.\u201d\n\nOne of the five votes cast against the media protection measure was from Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), who called the legislation a diversion by the White House, pointing out it was introduced three days after news broke that the government had secretly subpoenaed two months\u2019 worth of phone records for staff at the Associated Press and had obtained a secret search warrant to review emails of Fox News journalist James Rosen.\n\n\u201cA new law is not what we need,\u201d Cornyn said, regardless of whether the Obama administration has \u201cbeen the most abusive to the press in modern times.\u201d He said the fact that the Senate was debating who should be considered a journalist should be \u201cchilling to us all,\u201d but during the meeting said only American journalists should be protected.\n\nHowever, the Texas senator noted that putting such legislation into place would likely prevent the Obama administration and future administrations from overstepping their authority.\n\nDOJ revamps media guidelines\n\nAfter the revelations that media organizations were being spied on emerged earlier this summer, President Obama told the Justice Department to develop guidelines to protect journalists and pledged his support for the pending media shield bill.\n\nIn July, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder released seven new media guidelines for the Department of Justice. Arguably the biggest alteration was that reporters would be notified within 45 days of a request from the DOJ to turn over communications or business records. The extended time period also allows a news organization or journalist to challenge the government\u2019s need to review the materials.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Would Edward Snowden count as a journalist under the proposed \"shield\" law?, Edward Snowden, Free Flow of Information Act, freedom of the press, Journalism, journalists, Senate, Senate Judiciary Committee, Wikileaks,", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Katie Rucke", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "Would Edward Snowden count as a journalist under the proposed \"shield\" law?, Edward Snowden, Free Flow of Information Act, freedom of the press, Journalism, journalists, Senate, Senate Judiciary Committee, Wikileaks,", "title": "What Counts As \u2018Journalism\u2019?
