The emerging Plan B in case Healthcare.gov is still FUBAR next month is to tell users to skip the site and sign up for the plan they want on the insurance company\u2019s own website instead. (Said one industry official recently to the NYT, \u201cIf they don\u2019t have Healthcare.gov up and running by the end of the month, direct enrollment is critical.\u201d) There are technical snags with that approach, namely the fact that insurers have no way to calculate an applicant\u2019s taxpayer subsidy (then again, neither do the feds), but at least it gives people a way to get covered before December 15 so that they have a plan in place on New Year\u2019s Day. Cold comfort for the millions who\u2019ve had their plans dropped, but some coverage is usually better than none.\n\nJust one problem. The law says that, in order to be eligible for subsidies, you have to enroll through an ObamaCare exchange. Buying your plan directly from an insurance company disqualifies you, no matter how low your income is. Time wrote about that specifically in the context of people who\u2019ve had their plans canceled and then been automatically enrolled by their insurer in a new plan. Because that enrollment didn\u2019t happen via an exchange, the insured gets no help from Uncle Sam with their new premiums. Experts on the law told Time that it\u2019s unambiguous:\n\nThe ACA subsidies are technically tax credits, but consumers can\u2019t apply for them later when they file their income tax returns. The subsidies are only available when consumers purchase coverage through the exchanges, according to CMS. \u201cAs far as retroactive premium tax credits for a plan outside the exchange, you can\u2019t do that under the statute,\u201d says Timothy S. Jost, a professor at Washington and Lee University and an expert on provisions of the new law.\n\nAs of yesterday, Sebelius herself was warning people that it\u2019s perfectly fine to sign up with insurers directly \u2014 unless you need a subsidy:\n\nSebelius urged those who know they will not qualify for a subsidy on their insurance premium to research available plans and contact their chosen insurance company directly, an option she said is working well. Subsidies generally are available for individuals earning less than $46,000 a year and families of four earning less than $92,000.\n\nBig problems here for the White House. If they go full bore in promoting direct enrollment with insurers as an alternative to Healthcare.gov, there are bound to be tons of lower-income people who somehow miss the fine print about not going that route if you need a subsidy. That means lots of rate shock and disgruntlement over their new unsubsidized premiums. An obvious alternative is to have insurers themselves ask people what their income is and to discourage them if they\u2019re below the $46,000/$92,000 threshold, but then that means the poor, who are supposed to be the law\u2019s big winners, end up being shut out of coverage for awhile even as middle-class and upper-middle-class people sign up. This is why, I assume, the White House hasn\u2019t promoted direct enrollment enthusiastically with a full-fledged PR campaign despite some congressional Democrats begging them to be more aggressive. They\u2019re probably better off having people not sign up for coverage than to nudge everyone towards direct enrollment and then have thousands of poor applicants shocked by the unaffordable rates being quoted to them.\n\nOr, of course, there\u2019s a third option: Obama could simply decide to ignore the statute and pay out subsidies anyway to people who directly enroll. Normally you don\u2019t have to game out \u201cwhat if the president just does something illegal instead?\u201d scenarios, but after the employer mandate was dubiously delayed and Obama foisted his highly questionable \u201cfix\u201d for plan cancellations on the insurance industry last week, the illegal option can\u2019t be ruled out. Maybe he\u2019ll conclude that, in the interest of getting as many people on the rolls as possible before December 15th, his best option is to tell the country to go ahead and enroll directly with insurance companies and then demagogue the hell out of the GOP later if they refuse to pass something granting subsidies to those direct enrollees retroactively. Decisions, decisions.\n\nOh, by the way \u2014 because of the way the section about subsidies in the ObamaCare statute was written, it may be that people are also ineligible for subsidies if they bought their plan \u2026 via Healthcare.gov. It\u2019s the state exchanges, the statute seems to say, that can bestow taxpayer subsidies on people whose income is below the cut-off. There\u2019s nothing in there about a federal exchange. That issue is currently tied up in court; if Healthcare.gov enrollees also end up disqualified for subsidies, all hell\u2019s going to break loose.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Decisions.", "title": "Next ObamaCare dilemma for Obama: Break the law to let people buy subsidized plans directly from insurers or not?", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2013/11/20/next-obamacare-dilemma-for-obama-break-the-law-to-let-people-buy-subsidized-plans-directly-from-insurers-or-not/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-20T23:41:47+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-20T22:11:18+00:00"}, "keywords": "direct, employer, insurers, mandate, november 30, Obama, ObamaCare, subsidies,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda61a\"", "article_summary": "Next ObamaCare dilemma for Obama: Break the law to let people buy subsidized plans directly from insurers or not?\nBuying your plan directly from an insurance company disqualifies you, no matter how low your income is.\nThis is why, I assume, the White House hasn\u2019t promoted direct enrollment enthusiastically with a full-fledged PR campaign despite some congressional Democrats begging them to be more aggressive.\nThe law says that, in order to be eligible for subsidies, you have to enroll through an ObamaCare exchange.\nCold comfort for the millions who\u2019ve had their plans dropped, but some coverage is usually better than none."}
