A wanted fugitive known for carrying weapons barricaded himself inside an Aurora home for more than seven hours on Saturday.

Around 9 a.m., Aurora police received a tip that Mario Thomas Lopez, 35, was staying at a home located at 1373 Florence Street. There were two outstanding warrants for Lopez’s arrest, one was for felony menacing and the other for possession of a concealed weapon.

Officers arrived at the home and confirmed that Lopez was inside.

“The man has a history of being armed and dangerous,” said Chris Amsler, Aurora police spokesman. “We set up a perimeter and called SWAT.”

Once police set up a perimeter around the home, they used a loud speaker to command everyone inside the house to come out. Everyone but Lopez followed the command.

A “less lethal foam projectile” was shot through the window in the house, but Lopez did not come out, according to the news release.

SWAT officers arrived at the home around 11 a.m. and negotiators were able to call Lopez on the phone. Lopez repeatedly told officers he was not inside the house and hung up on them.

He did not pick up the phone again.

Investigators obtained a search warrant around 4:30 p.m., before officers shot tear gas into the house. A few minutes later, Lopez — who had been hiding in the crawl space — walked out of the house.

Lopez was placed taken into custody and booked into the Aurora Detention Center.
