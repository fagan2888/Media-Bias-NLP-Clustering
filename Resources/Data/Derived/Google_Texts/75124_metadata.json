She announced July 23 that she will retire at the end of the season.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been observing me obviously for a while as a basketball player and as a person,\u201d said Hammon, who assisted the Spurs during an injury rehabilitation period last season. \u201cPop said, \u2018I\u2019m hiring you because you\u2019re a good fit here and you just happen to be a woman.\u2019 I just think that sums this up great.\u201d\n\nShe will be the second woman to coach in the NBA. Lisa Boyer, associate head women\u2019s basketball coach at South Carolina, was an unpaid assistant for the Cleveland Cavaliers during the 2001-02 season.\n\n\u201cIn some ways it is trailblazing, but there have been so many other women doing great things and I\u2019m just following in their path,\u201d Hammon said.\n\nThe six-time WNBA all-star was named one of the league\u2019s all-time top-15 players in 2011. She ranks seventh in career points (5,809), fourth in assists (1,687), second in 3-pointers made (824) and sixth in games played (445) over 16 years with the Stars and New York Liberty.\n\nShe suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament in July 2013, something she called a \u201cblessing in disguise\u201d because it gave her a chance to work with the Spurs coaching staff during that rehab.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my body telling me that it\u2019s time,\u201d she said. \u201cThis opportunity happens to coincide, so it\u2019s a pretty magical thing that I\u2019m walking out of a playing career into a coaching opportunity.\u201d\n\nIn a statement released Tuesday, Popovich said: \u201cI very much look forward to the addition of Becky Hammon to our staff. Having observed her working with our team this past season, I\u2019m confident her basketball IQ, work ethic and interpersonal skills will be a great benefit to the Spurs.\u201d\n\nHammon played at CSU from 1995-99, scoring more points in her career than any Rams player, with 2,740. She was a two-time All-American and three-time Western Athletic Conference player of the year. She also won the Frances Pomeroy Naismith Award for the best player in the nation under the height of 5-foot-8 in 1999.\n\nJoe Nguyen: jnguyen@denverpost.com or twitter.com/joenguyen", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Becky Hammon, former CSU star, named San Antonio Spurs assistant", "title": "Becky Hammon, former CSU star, named San Antonio Spurs assistant", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/05/becky-hammon-former-csu-star-named-san-antonio-spurs-assistant/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140805__becky-hammon-spurs-080514p1.jpg", "height": 469}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140805__becky-hammon-spurs-080514p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-05T11:45:58+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T09:19:17+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf5ea\"", "article_summary": "Former Colorado State star Becky Hammon was hired as an assistant to coach Gregg Popovich of the San Antonio Spurs, the team announced Tuesday.\nLisa Boyer, associate head women\u2019s basketball coach at South Carolina, was an unpaid assistant for the Cleveland Cavaliers during the 2001-02 season.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been observing me obviously for a while as a basketball player and as a person,\u201d said Hammon, who assisted the Spurs during an injury rehabilitation period last season.\nHammon, 37, is playing with the San Antonio Stars in the WNBA.\nShe also won the Frances Pomeroy Naismith Award for the best player in the nation under the height of 5-foot-8 in 1999."}
