I got a glimpse into her priorities as I was working on this interview. Klein told me she was worried that some of the things she had said would make it hard for her to land an interview with a president of the one of the Big Green groups (read below and you\u2019ll see why). She was more interested in nabbing the story than being the story; her reporting trumped any opinion-making.\n\nSuch focus is a hallmark of Klein\u2019s career. She doesn\u2019t do much of the chattering class\u2019s news cycle blathering. She works steadily, carefully, quietly. It can be surprising to remember that Klein\u2019s immense global influence rests on a relatively small body of work; she has published three books, one of which is an anthology of magazine pieces.\n\nKlein\u2019s first book, No Logo , investigated how brand names manipulate public desires while exploiting the people who make their products. The book came out just weeks after the WTO protests in Seattle and became an international bestseller. Her next major book, The Shock Doctrine , argued that free-marketeers often use crises \u2013 natural or manufactured \u2013 to ram through deregulatory policies. With her newest, yet-to-be named book, Klein turns her attention to climate change. Scheduled for release in 2014, the book will also be made into a film by her husband and creative partner, Avi Lewis.\n\nKlein\u2019s books and articles have sought to articulate a counternarrative to the march of corporate globalization and government austerity. She believes climate change provides a new chance for creating such a counternarrative. \u201cThe book I am writing is arguing that our responses to climate change can rebuild the public sphere, can strengthen our communities, can have work with dignity.\u201d\n\nFirst, though, she has to finish the reporting. As she told me, speaking about the grass-roots response to climate chaos: \u201cRight now it\u2019s under the radar, but I\u2019m following it quite closely.\u201d\n\nDuring your career you\u2019ve written about the power of brand names, populist movements around the world, and free market fundamentalism. Why now a book and film on climate change?\n\nYou know, The Shock Doctrine , my last book, ends with climate change. It ends with a vision of a dystopic future where you have weak infrastructure colliding with heavy weather, as we saw with Hurricane Katrina. And rather than working to prevent future disasters by having lower emissions, you have all these attempts to take advantage of that crisis. At the time, it seemed to me that climate change was potentially going to be the biggest disaster-capitalism free-for-all that we\u2019ve seen yet. So it was quite a logical progression for me to go from writing about disaster-capitalism in The Shock Doctrine to writing about climate change. As I was writing The Shock Doctrine , I was covering the Iraq War and profiteering from the war, and I started to see these patterns repeat in the aftermath of natural disasters, like the Asian tsunami and then Hurricane Katrina. There are chapters in that book on both of those events. Then I came to the idea that climate change could be a kind of a \u201cpeople\u2019s shock,\u201d an answer to the shock doctrine \u2013 not just another opportunity by the disaster capitalists to feed off of misery, but an opportunity for progressive forces to deepen democracy and really improve livelihoods around the world. Then I came across the idea of \u201cclimate debt\u201d when I was doing a piece on reparations for Harper\u2019s magazine. I had a meeting with Bolivia\u2019s climate negotiator in Geneva \u2013 her name is Ang\u00e9lica Navarro \u2013 and she put the case to me that climate change could be an opportunity for a global Green Marshall Plan with the North paying climate debts in the form of huge green development project.\n\nIn the wake of Hurricane Sandy you wrote about the potential of a \u201cpeople\u2019s shock.\u201d Do you see that it\u2019s happening, a global grass-roots response to some of the extreme weather we\u2019re experiencing?\n\nI see a people\u2019s shock happening broadly, where on lots of different fronts you have constituencies coming forward who have been fighting, for instance, for sustainable agriculture for many, many years, and now realize that it\u2019s also a climate solution. You have a lot of reframing of issues \u2013 and not in an opportunistic way, just another layer of understanding. Here in Canada, the people who oppose the tar sands most forcefully are Indigenous people living downstream from the tar sands. They are not opposing it because of climate change \u2013 they are opposing it because it poisons their bodies. But the fact that it\u2019s also ruining the planet adds another layer of urgency. And it\u2019s that layering of climate change on top of other issues that holds a huge amount of potential.\n\nIn terms of Hurricane Sandy, I really do see some hopeful, grass-roots responses, particularly in the Rockaways, where people were very organized right from the beginning, where Occupy Sandy was very strong, where new networks emerged. The first phase is just recovery, and now as you have a corporate-driven reconstruction process descending, those organized communities are in a position to respond, to go to the meetings, to take on the real estate developers, to talk about another vision of public housing that is way better than what\u2019s there right now. So yeah, it\u2019s definitely happening. Right now it\u2019s under the radar, but I\u2019m following it quite closely.\n\nIn a piece you wrote for the Nation in November 2011 you suggested that when it comes to climate change, there\u2019s a dual denialism at work \u2013 conservatives deny the science while some liberals deny the political implications of the science. Why do you think that some environmentalists are resistant to grappling with climate change\u2019s implications for the market and for economics?\n\nWell, I think there is a very deep denialism in the environmental movement among the Big Green groups. And to be very honest with you, I think it\u2019s been more damaging than the right-wing denialism in terms of how much ground we\u2019ve lost. Because it has steered us in directions that have yielded very poor results. I think if we look at the track record of Kyoto, of the UN Clean Development Mechanism, the European Union\u2019s emissions trading scheme \u2013 we now have close to a decade that we can measure these schemes against, and it\u2019s disastrous. Not only are emissions up, but you have no end of scams to point to, which gives fodder to the right. The right took on cap-and-trade by saying it\u2019s going to bankrupt us, it\u2019s handouts to corporations, and, by the way, it\u2019s not going to work. And they were right on all counts. Not in the bankrupting part, but they were right that this was a massive corporate giveaway, and they were right that it wasn\u2019t going to bring us anywhere near what scientists were saying we needed to do lower emissions. So I think it\u2019s a really important question why the green groups have been so unwilling to follow science to its logical conclusions. I think the scientists Kevin Anderson and his colleague Alice Bows at the Tyndall Centre have been the most courageous on this because they don\u2019t just take on the green groups, they take on their fellow scientists for the way in which neoliberal economic orthodoxy has infiltrated the scientific establishment. It\u2019s really scary reading. Because they have been saying, for at least for a decade, that getting to the emissions reduction levels that we need to get to in the developed world is not compatible with economic growth.\n\nWhat we know is that the environmental movement had a series of dazzling victories in the late \u201960s and in the \u201970s where the whole legal framework for responding to pollution and to protecting wildlife came into law. It was just victory after victory after victory. And these were what came to be called \u201ccommand-and-control\u201d pieces of legislation. It was \u201cdon\u2019t do that.\u201d That substance is banned or tightly regulated. It was a top-down regulatory approach. And then it came to screeching halt when Reagan was elected. And he essentially waged war on the environmental movement very openly. We started to see some of the language that is common among those deniers \u2013 to equate environmentalism with Communism and so on. As the Cold War dwindled, environmentalism became the next target, the next Communism. Now, the movement at that stage could have responded in one of the two ways. It could have fought back and defended the values it stood for at that point, and tried to resist the steamroller that was neoliberalism in its early days. Or it could have adapted itself to this new reality, and changed itself to fit the rise of corporatist government. And it did the latter. Very consciously if you read what [Environmental Defense Fund president] Fred Krupp was saying at the time.\n\nIt was go along or get along.\n\nExactly. We now understand it\u2019s about corporate partnerships. It\u2019s not, \u201csue the bastards;\u201d it\u2019s, \u201cwork through corporate partnerships with the bastards.\u201d There is no enemy anymore.\n\nMore than that, it\u2019s casting corporations as the solution, as the willing participants and part of this solution. That\u2019s the model that has lasted to this day.\n\nI go back to something even like the fight over NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement. The Big Green groups, with very few exceptions, lined up in favor of NAFTA, despite the fact that their memberships were revolting, and sold the deal very aggressively to the public. That\u2019s the model that has been globalized through the World Trade Organization, and that is responsible in many ways for the levels of soaring emissions. We\u2019ve globalized an utterly untenable economic model of hyperconsumerism. It\u2019s now successfully spreading across the world, and it\u2019s killing us.\n\nIt\u2019s not that the green groups were spectators to this \u2013 they were partners in this. They were willing participants in this. It\u2019s not every green group. It\u2019s not Greenpeace, it\u2019s not Friends of the Earth, it\u2019s not, for the most part, the Sierra Club. It\u2019s not 350.org, because it didn\u2019t even exist yet. But I think it goes back to the elite roots of the movement, and the fact that when a lot of these conservation groups began there was kind of a noblesse oblige approach to conservation. It was about elites getting together and hiking and deciding to save nature. And then the elites changed. So if the environmental movement was going to decide to fight, they would have had to give up their elite status. And weren\u2019t willing to give up their elite status. I think that\u2019s a huge part of the reason why emissions are where they are.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The \"No Logo\" author explains how environmentalists may be more damaging to their cause than climate change deniers", "title": "Naomi Klein: Big Green is in denial", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The \"No Logo\" author explains how environmentalists may be more damaging to their cause than climate change deniers", "title": "Naomi Klein: Big Green is in denial", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/09/05/naomi_klein_big_green_groups_are_crippling_the_environmental_movement_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/09/naomi_klein.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The \"No Logo\" author explains how environmentalists may be more damaging to their cause than climate change deniers", "title": "Naomi Klein: Big Green is in denial", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/09/naomi_klein.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jason Mark", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Earth Island Journal, Editor's Picks, Kyoto, Naomi Klein, No Logo, UN Clean Development Mechanism", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9b53\"", "article_summary": "Well, I think there is a very deep denialism in the environmental movement among the Big Green groups.\nIt\u2019s not that the green groups were spectators to this \u2013 they were partners in this.\nThe Big Green groups, with very few exceptions, lined up in favor of NAFTA, despite the fact that their memberships were revolting, and sold the deal very aggressively to the public.\nAnd it\u2019s that layering of climate change on top of other issues that holds a huge amount of potential.\nThey are not opposing it because of climate change \u2013 they are opposing it because it poisons their bodies."}
