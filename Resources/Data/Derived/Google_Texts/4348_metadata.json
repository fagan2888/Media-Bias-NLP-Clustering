Now, marketer may wish to reach a consumer on their phone or tablet.\n\nThe practice concerns privacy advocates who worry that it is becoming more difficult for consumers to avoid such tracking.\n\n\u201cIn the case of both types of tracking the best solution is increased transparency and a robust and meaningful opt-out system,\u201d officials from the Center for Democracy and Technology said in public comments filed with the FTC. \u201cIf cross-device tracking companies cannot give users these types of notice and control, they should not engage in cross-device tracking.\u201d\n\nRamirez gave a nod to those concerns in her remarks.\n\n\u201cWhile tracking itself is not new, the ways in which data is collected, compiled, stored, and analyzed certainly is,\u201d she said, adding later that \u201cthese concerns are exacerbated by consumers\u2019 lack of awareness of, and choices about, tracking.\u201d\n\nBut she also said that cross-device tracking has some benefits, like allowing users to pick up reading a book on their tablet where they left off on their phone.\n\nShe also noted that the commission had undertaken enforcement actions against actors in the advertising-tracking space and was happy to see companies creating features to protect consumer privacy.\n\n\u201cWorking through these novel and complex issues together today and in continuing conversations will help ensure that consumers\u2019 privacy interests are protected while allowing for continued innovation in the digital marketplace,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Cross-device tracking allows marketers to target consumers across different devices.", "description": "Cross-device tracking allows marketers to target consumers across different devices.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "David McCabe", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Cross-device tracking allows marketers to target consumers across different devices.", "title": "FTC chief raises concerns about online tracking of consumers", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/260283-ftc-head-new-ad-tracking-raises-questions", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/cellphonegetty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T05:25-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/260283-ftc-head-new-ad-tracking-raises-questions", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2015-11-16T14:12-05:00", "dcterms.creator": "David McCabe", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-16T14:12:04-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00"}, "keywords": ",,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/260283-ftc-head-new-ad-tracking-raises-questions", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Cross-device tracking allows marketers to target consumers across different devices.", "card": "summary", "title": "FTC chief raises concerns about online tracking of consumers"}, "dcterms.title": "FTC chief raises concerns about online tracking of consumers"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIf cross-device tracking companies cannot give users these types of notice and control, they should not engage in cross-device tracking.\u201dRamirez gave a nod to those concerns in her remarks.\nThe practice concerns privacy advocates who worry that it is becoming more difficult for consumers to avoid such tracking.\nIt has become significantly more common as an increasing number of Americans adopt connected devices in addition to their home computers or laptops.\nNow, marketer may wish to reach a consumer on their phone or tablet.\nThe head of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) says new methods for tracking consumers across different devices are raising \u201cadditional questions and challenges.\u201d\u201cSome of the techniques that companies employ to collect data passively across devices mean that online tracking is even more hidden from the typical consumer,\u201d said FTC Chair Edith Ramirez on Monday, according to the prepared text of her remarks."}
