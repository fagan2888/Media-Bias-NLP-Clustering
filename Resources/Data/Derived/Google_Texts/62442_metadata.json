But as Cruz would tell audiences, his vote in the Senate wasn't all that relevant to whether Obamacare would be funded. The House of Representatives held the power of the purse; it was up to them to defund. The real movers on the strategy were Georgia Rep. Tom Graves and North Carolina Rep. Mark Meadows, the authors (respectively) of the defund-Obamacare bill and the pledge to oppose any continuing resolution that didn't defund.\n\nDavid Weigel David Weigel is a reporter for the Washington Post.\n\nSo Cruz might now be dodging questions of whether he'd \"shut the government down again.\" Meadows has mellowed. That process began as soon as the media started coming after him for the letter. \"I\u2019m one of 435 members and a very small part of this,\" he said on the first day of the shutdown.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAfter the shutdown ended, Meadows told a local paper that he always wanted to prevent the madness.\n\nCongressman Mark Meadows said Thursday he fought up to the final hours to prevent it from occurring and worked hard over the last 16 days to stave off its impact on his district.\n\nIn a phone interview Thursday as he drove home from Washington, Meadows said he spent 30 minutes with an Obama administration aide at the Capitol the night before the Oct. 1 shutdown \u201ctrying to work things out, seeing if there are some areas we could make tweaks to Obamacare and avoid a shutdown.\u201d\n\nThat same day, I asked Meadows whether, in a few months, he would write another letter opposing the next CR. What if Obamacare wasn't defunded by then\u2014would it be time for a new pledge?\n\n\"We're not going to need to because the president has said he's willing to negotiate when there's not a gun to his head,\" said Meadows.* \"We'll fix all the problems between now and then. I'm gonna hold him to his word\u2014his word was that he was willing to negotiate now, and that's what we all expect.\"\n\nObviously Meadows could change his mind in a few months, but I was struck how pragmatic he wanted to sound.", "article_metadata": {"fb-share": "The Author of the \"Defund Obamacare\" Letter Doesn't Want to Write It Again", "sailthru.author": "David Weigel", "description": "Ted Cruz gets most of the media's credit/blame for the goverment shutdown.
