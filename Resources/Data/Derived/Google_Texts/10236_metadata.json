According to a recent report by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, states would leave more than $400 billion in federal funds untapped if they opt not to move forward with the coverage expansion and hospitals in those states would lose out on nearly $170 billion in payments.\u201cWe saw an opportunity to really advance one of our key mission areas, which is coverage expansion,\u201d said Jim Hinton, chairman of AHA\u2019s board of directors and the president of Presbyterian Healthcare Services in Albuquerque. \u201cThese were one-time grants to various associations that would help them get the word out.\u201dThe AHA took in $124 million in revenue in 2013, an increase of 5% compared with the previous year. The bulk of those dollars came from membership dues, which increased from $78.6 million to $78.9 million.The AHA\u2019s single-biggest expense was salaries and benefits, which totaled more than $50 million in 2013. The group\u2019s CEO, Richard Umbdenstock, received total compensation and benefits of $1.9 million.The AHA reported 2013 lobbying expenses of $1.8 million. That was down slightly from $1.9 million the previous year. Hinton said the group\u2019s top priority in Washington is advocating for relief from onerous regulatory burdens, such as the two-midnight rule governing Medicare inpatient payments.\u201cEven though Congress is in recess, the regulatory issues march on,\u201d Hinton said.Follow Paul Demko on Twitter: @MHpdemko", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#0a365e", "description": "The American Hospital Association's expenditures increased by 7% in 2013, to $117 million, spurred in part by efforts to convince states to expand Medicaid, according to the organization's most recent tax return.", "title": "AHA doled out $3.3 million in 2013 to advocate Medicaid expansion", "og": {"site_name": "Modern Healthcare", "description": "The American Hospital Association's expenditures increased by 7% in 2013, to $117 million, spurred in part by efforts to convince states to expand Medicaid, according to the organization's most recent tax return.", "title": "AHA doled out $3.3 million in 2013 to advocate Medicaid expansion", "url": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20140818/NEWS/308189939", "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/mh-logo-fb-lg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com", "description": "The American Hospital Association's expenditures increased by 7% in 2013, to $117 million, spurred in part by efforts to convince states to expand Medicaid, according to the organization's most recent tax return.", "creator": "@modrnhealthcr", "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/mh-logo-twitter.jpg", "title": "AHA doled out $3.3 million in 2013 to advocate Medicaid expansion", "site": "@modrnhealthcr", "card": "summary"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Modern Healthcare", "published_at": "2014-08-18", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "url": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20140818/NEWS/308189939", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "msapplication-TileImage": "https:/raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/ms-touch-icon-144x144-precomposed.png", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/mh-logo-g-plus.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9c31\"", "article_summary": "Roughly half of the states have opted for the Medicaid expansion.\nThe group\u2019s CEO, Richard Umbdenstock, received total compensation and benefits of $1.9 million.The AHA reported 2013 lobbying expenses of $1.8 million.\nThat was down slightly from $1.9 million the previous year.\nThe bulk of those dollars came from membership dues, which increased from $78.6 million to $78.9 million.The AHA\u2019s single-biggest expense was salaries and benefits, which totaled more than $50 million in 2013.\n\u201cThese were one-time grants to various associations that would help them get the word out.\u201dThe AHA took in $124 million in revenue in 2013, an increase of 5% compared with the previous year."}
