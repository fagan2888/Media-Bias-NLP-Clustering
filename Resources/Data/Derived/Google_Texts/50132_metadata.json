(His part of the interview starts at about 8:30 on the video.)\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSmiddy is a physician first and driver second. \u201cI had to go to tractor-trailer school,\u201d he told correspondent Scott Pelley. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy.\u201d Even harder was finding someone to insure a doctor to drive a tractor-trailer.\n\nThe X-ray machine helps him diagnose lung and other respiratory diseases among people who live in the area.\n\n\u201cThis is a third world country of diabetes, hypertension, lung cancer, and COPD,\u201d he said. He also sees a lot of black lung disease among former coal miners. These people are financially just scraping by, so can\u2019t afford regular medical care and have no health insurance. Some lost their jobs; others work for minimum-wage jobs with no insurance benefits. Obamacare isn\u2019t helping them because their state did not expand Medicaid.\n\nOf course I eyeballed the doctor\u2019s rig. An International 9200 sleeper-cab tractor pulls the purpose-built X-ray van. The van appears to be about 45 feet long. Streaks of rust suggest the trailer was built years ago.\n\nJoe Smiddy is a doctor who also drives a special 18-wheeler.\n\nLettering on the tractor indicates it\u2019s provided by Land-Air Express, an expedited carrier based on Bowling Green, Ky. If you\u2019re a shipper, please send some business their way.\n\nGardner and Meade, friends since 8th grade, drive the old Winnebago through the \u201chollers\u201d to hold their clinic hours on parking lots throughout the four-county area. They look and act like angels, diagnosing ills, and dispensing prescription drugs and medical advice along with big doses of hope and mercy.\n\nAngels on wheels, Teresa Gardner (right) and Paula Meade are nurse practitioners who go about their rounds in a converted motor home.\n\n\u201cThey have nowhere else to go,\u201d Meade said of their patients, some of them \u201ctrain wrecks\u201d from neglected maladies and medical conditions. The nurses apply for government grants that cover about a third of Health Wagon\u2019s $1.5 million annual budget, and appeal to churches and charities for the rest.\n\nThe organization has a brief website, www.thehealthwagon.org. On it are links to their Facebook site, www.facebook.com/TheHealthWagon, where there are scores of pictures of the nurses and their patients. They accept donations through the Network For Good; I just sent in 50 bucks, and I hope a million other viewers did the same after watching 60 Minutes.\n\nGardner and Meade previously raised enough money to replace their old Winnebago, beset as it is in the video with a non-working windshield defroster and a hole in the floorboards, Pelley reported. They deserve a deluxe diesel pusher.\n\nAnd while Dr. Smiddy evidently handles the multi-speed manual tranny just fine, he'd probably appreciate a newer tractor with an automated or automatic transmission. I don\u2019t know the mechanical condition his X-ray van, but it sure could use a coat of paint.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Charity, Medical Fleets, Truck Driving Schools, Trailers", "ROBOTS": "ALL", "Copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 TruckingInfo.com", "description": "Senior Editor Tom Berg was moved by Sunday\u2019s \"60 Minutes\" story on Health Wagon, carrying medicine and hope to Appalachia -- and intrigued by the X-ray trailer and the medical director who went to tractor-trailer school to learn to drive the rig.
