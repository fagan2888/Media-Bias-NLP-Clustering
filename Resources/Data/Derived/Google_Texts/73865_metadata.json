Frank R. Wolf, the Virginia Republican incumbent.\n\nDemocrats were giddy at the prospect of turning the 10th District into a blue redoubt in the Washington suburbs, only to see their nominee, Fairfax County Supervisor John W. Foust, commit a dreaded sexist gaffe. In a speech in late summer, Mr. Foust dismissed his Republican opponent, Virginia state Delegate Barbara Comstock, as a Washington insider who had never held \u201ca real job.\u201d It\u2019s not clear why this was necessarily a \u201csexist\u201d gaffe, but an accusation of \u201csexism\u201d is as deadly as the Ebola virus, and the remark was a costly mistake.\n\nMrs. Comstock earned her law degree as a stay-at-home mom taking night courses. She\u2019s a former congressional aide to Mr. Wolf and a former Justice Department official. Mrs. Comstock unleashed campaign ads observing that Mr. Foust is the one who will need \u201ca real job\u201d after Nov. 4. The Foust faux pas prompted the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee to withdraw a $2.8 million campaign blitz, according to Roll Call, the Capitol Hill political newspaper.\n\nMrs. Comstock is a common-sense conservative who would repeal Obamacare, defend the Second Amendment and lend her voice to protect the unborn. Mrs. Comstock opposes the Obama administration\u2019s war on coal that would cost 9,000 jobs in Virginia.\n\nIn the legislature, Mrs. Comstock stood up to the unions by drafting the law that now shields employees from being harassed by labor organizers who improperly obtain worker phone numbers and email addresses from employers. She proposed a bill that would have tied the state\u2019s mass-transit funding to objective performance measures, requiring the bureaucracy to work to get the public\u2019s money. It\u2019s a novel concept, one that ought to spread to Capitol Hill.\n\nMr. Foust prescribes a job-killing raise in the federal minimum wage because \u201cIt\u2019s time to give America a raise\u201d \u2014 an idea he obviously copied from a bumper sticker. He\u2019s pushing amnesty \u201cwith a clear path to citizenship,\u201d which would add millions of undocumented newcomers to the voter rolls who would be expected to be Democrats. He\u2019s a generic liberal whose campaign shows little imagination or creativity.\n\nFrank Wolf has been a unique voice in Washington, especially on human rights. He won\u2019t be easy to replace, but his former aide will be up to the task. We enthusiastically recommend Barbara Comstock for Congress in Virginia\u2019s 10th Congressional District.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Perhaps nowhere else has the Democrats' phony \"Republican war on women\" narrative boomeranged, and in such force, as in the race for the House seat being vacated by Rep.
