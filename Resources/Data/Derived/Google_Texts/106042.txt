Fuel3D, a crazy cool piece of hardware which allows you to do 3D scans, crushed their Kickstarter campaign goal of $75,000 by raising over $300,000, is ready to go public. The device will be stepping into the limelight at the 3D Printshow in London next week. The company will be demonstrating its 3D scanning technology in public for the first time at a major public event.

Fuel3D is the affordable handheld 3D scanner that delivers high resolution shape and color capture for a range of 3D modeling applications, such as 3D printing, as well as on-screen applications like 3D art, animation and game development. The imminent arrival of Fuel3D, priced from £830, heralds a new price point in handheld 3D scanning technology, which typically sees products retail for £10,000 and above.

On November 8th at 1:15pm, Fuel3D and technical collaboration partner, Uformia, will present a workshop showing how Uformia’s MeshUP software will complement the capabilities of Fuel3D to create full 360 degree scans of objects. This “auto-stitching” functionality will be provided as part of the Fuel3D product bundle. Interested attendees may register here to view.

Fuel3D is the world’s first 3D scanner to combine pre-calibrated stereo cameras with photometric imaging to capture and process a 3D model in seconds. The technology behind Fuel3D was originally developed within Oxford University.

Born in Oxford University, Fuel3D is developed by an expert team of hardware and software engineers and scientists. Originally developed for the medical imaging sector, Fuel3D’s technology is being adapted for the broader 3D market, with the goal of bringing the benefits of point-and-shoot 3D imaging to consumers and professionals alike.
