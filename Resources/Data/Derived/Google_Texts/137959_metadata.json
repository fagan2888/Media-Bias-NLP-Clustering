Now Gov. Larry Hogan, Jr. wants the former Anne Arundel County Executive, former state senator and former state delegate to take on another near-mission impossible: reorganize state government.\n\nIt sounds like a simple task but it isn\u2019t \u2013 not when Maryland\u2019s government spends $42 billion a year and employs over 80,000 entrenched bureaucrats and nearly 10,000 contract workers.\n\nCompounding Neall\u2019s assignment: Republican Hogan\u2019s motives are deeply distrusted by the Democratic legislature. Any move that smacks of cutting government operations to pay for election-year tax cuts will be buried by legislative Democrats.\n\nNeall says Hogan hasn\u2019t asked him to slash government spending to make way for voter-appealing tax cuts. Instead, \u201cthis is something the governor wants to be part of his contribution \u2013 modernizing government and make it perform better, and maybe in the process saving money.\u201d\n\nThe idea, according to Neal, is to come up with \u201ca new platform capable of doing more and delivering better services and hopefully at lower unit prices. The businessman in the governor is coming out. It\u2019s not just about budget cuts to make tax cuts possible.\u201d\n\nState government certainly could use a good shake-up.\n\nMandel\u2019s magic\n\nThere hasn\u2019t been a major reorganization in 46 years, when Marvin Mandel, taking his cue from proposals put forth by the 1968 Constitutional Convention, took 248 unwieldy agencies and boxed them into 12 cabinet-level departments.\n\nSuddenly the governor, not individual fiefdoms, controlled state government. It was one of Mandel\u2019s great achievements, giving Maryland government a modern organization that was manageable and the envy of other states.\n\nWhile Mandel\u2019s basic structure has stood the test of time, the state\u2019s operations again have spread its wings, becoming ungainly, duplicative and inefficient.\n\nNeall sees his main opportunity in an area that would avoid headlines: government\u2019s \u201cbackroom\u201d operations \u2013 the massive services and supplies needed for the daily activities of 90,000 state workers.\n\n\u201cHaving a Department of Veterans Affairs is fine,\u201d he noted, \u201cbut it may not need its own personnel office, its own purchasing office, its own procurement office.\u201d\n\nCentralized backroom services might make sense, especially in an age of computers and two-way video communications. But it can still be controversial \u2013 witness the furor among parole office workers when personnel functions were removed from their workplace and consolidated at the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services.\n\nIT laggard\n\nMaryland government also has a reputation for lagging behind the times in information technology. Witness the disgracefully botched software to handle the Affordable Care Act and the continual IT screw-ups in social services computer operations.\n\nNeall diplomatically notes, \u201cMaryland state government has never been good at using technology. We\u2019ve lost a lot of ground.\u201d\n\nImproved IT operations may hold the key to a leap forward in government efficiency and customer satisfaction but Neall\u2019s efforts could encounter a major barrier \u2013 the costs involved.\n\nMaryland\u2019s Parole Commission, for instance is awash in paperwork. Boxes of inmate records are piled to the ceiling in large storage rooms. Converting these legal documents to computer-accessible records and protecting this data from cyber theft won\u2019t be cheap or rapid.\n\nNeall sees his main job as taking a hard-eyed look at state operations and then answering this question: \u201cWhat\u2019s the best way to deliver services to citizens today?\u201d\n\nFor example, \u201cWe no longer get all our clothes in a clothing store; we shop online off a website.\u201d\n\nProcess, not overhaul\n\nNeall is not talking about wiping out entire departments and turning government into an amorphous internet presence. Instead, he wants to zero in on how state employees and agencies go about their jobs: \u201cHow they organize their work, the processes and the time sensitivity.\u201d\n\nIn many areas, government is unnecessarily slow and cumbersome, irritating the heck out of constituents. It may be time to learn from the private sector.\n\nThere are private companies that will deliver to you your birth and death certificates in a matter of hours \u2013 for a fee. But ask state government for that same information and it could take weeks.\n\nA cottage industry has sprung up due to the frustration people encounter waiting hours in long lines at the Motor Vehicle Administration. For a fee, these companies will take care of everything for you. While there have been improvements at the MVA, it still isn\u2019t market-sensitive or people-friendly.\n\nThose are the types of efficiency changes Neall has in mind.\n\nAvoiding controversy\n\nHe\u2019s hoping it won\u2019t involve wholesale reorganizations that would raise hackles among legislators, unions and other interest groups.\n\nSo the chances of a Mandel-style re-shuffling of powerful state agencies aren\u2019t likely. Indeed, most state operations will look the same to Marylanders.\n\n\u201cThe storefront stays if you can deliver products in a timely fashion, create a sense of urgency and customer satisfaction,\u201d Neall says.\n\nThroughout his career, Neall has been recognized as an insightful budget analyst skilled in dissecting complicated business and government operations and then suggesting cost-saving efficiencies.\n\nTurnaround artist\n\nHe\u2019s worked for Johns Hopkins Medicine for a quarter-century, the last 12 as head of Hopkins\u2019 managed-care organization for the poor and near-poor. Priority Partners is the largest MCO in the state, but when Neall took over it was $10 million in the red. Within a year, he had eliminated the red ink.\n\nNeall is trusted and respected by both Republicans and Democrats in Annapolis. He knows the magnitude of his task.\n\nIf anyone can pull this off it is Bobby Neall. The goal he has set is modernization, not wholesale reorganization.\n\nIt may not be sexy, but Neall would be happy to see a quiet, successful implementation that most people don\u2019t even notice.\n\nBarry Rascovar\u2019s blog is www.politicalmaryland.com.
