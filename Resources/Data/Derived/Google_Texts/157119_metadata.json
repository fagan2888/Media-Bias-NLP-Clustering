Burwell, the National Center for Public Policy Research announces the release of a spreadsheet detailing the many health care reform plans that have been developed by conservatives and libertarians as possible alternatives to ObamaCare.\n\nIf the plaintiffs in King v. Burwell succeed, millions of people who purchased their health insurance via the federal ObamaCare exchanges will lose their taxpayer-supplied subsidies. Each of these dozen plans offers them a promising alternative.\n\n\u201cThe political left is trying to scare people by saying that the political right has no plan to help those people if they lose their subsidies,\u201d says Dr. David Hogberg, health care policy analyst at the National Center. \u201cNothing could be further from the truth.\u201d\n\nA new National Center study by Dr. Hogberg includes an easy-to-access spreadsheet at http://goo.gl/y1ALI2 that summarizes a dozen plans from conservative and libertarian think-tanks and Congressional Republicans offering free-market alternatives to ObamaCare. The spreadsheet explains how each plan treats vital health care policy issues such as tax credits, pre-existing conditions, Medicaid and Health Savings Accounts.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of great ideas out there, from the Heritage Foundation and the Cato Institute to Rep. Tom Price and the Republican Study Committee,\u201d said Dr. Hogberg. \u201cUnfortunately, most of the media has ignored them, so most Americans are unaware that free-market alternatives to ObamaCare exist.\u201d\n\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, known colloquially as ObamaCare, states that only people enrolled in state-based exchanges are eligible to receive taxpayer-paid subsidies to help them pay for their health insurance premiums. Despite this, the Obama Administration has paid subsidies to people who purchased insurance on the federal exchange as well. King v. Burwell challenges the Obama Administration\u2019s practice of allowing subsidies to flow to federal exchanges.\n\n\u201cKing v. Burwell could give Congress a big opportunity to move the nation away from the disaster that is ObamaCare and toward a free-market health care system that would make health care and health insurance more affordable for everyone,\u201d says Dr. Hogberg. \u201cAnd as the dozen plans show, there are ways to do it that will help people on the federal exchanges who could lose subsidies.\u201d\n\nTo review the dozen free-market alternatives to ObamaCare spreadsheet, please visithttp://goo.gl/y1ALI2 and for a review of the terms used in the spreadsheet, please visit http://www.nationalcenter.org/NPA670.html.\n\nThe National Center for Public Policy Research was founded in 1982.
