CNBC's Sharon Epperson reports on problems taxpayers have been facing in regard to the Affordable Care Act.

California's got smaller Obamacare dreams, while Hawaii may be saying "Aloha" to its troubled Obamacare exchange.

California's Obamacare marketplace—the largest state-run health exchange in the U.S.—will spend less money next year and expects to enroll fewer people than originally projected.

Covered California's paring back for the third year of Obamacare enrollment comes after its second season saw lower-than-expected sign-ups, and the expenditure of most of the $1 billion in federal funds that the insurance exchange had been granted.

"The lessons from real-world experience are sharpening projections going forward," Covered California said in a press release.

The exchange expects to spend $58 million less in the coming fiscal year, a 15 percent reduction.
