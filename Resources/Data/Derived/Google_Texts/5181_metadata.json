It\u2019s also coming from some conservative journalists, who apparently believe their vocation involves abetting dishonest pressure groups.\n\nFrom @dcexaminer: Media should fact-check Obama, not Obamacare victims. http://t.co/5XCKe6LXbZ \u2014 Byron York (@ByronYork) February 25, 2014\n\nWelcome back to the hack gap.\n\nThe article linked in the above tweet admittedly does not argue for impunity as explicitly as its headline does.
