And the program is growing rapidly, thanks largely to the law, which provides hundreds of billions of dollars of federal aid to states to expand Medicaid eligibility to low-income, working-age adults. (Medicaid historically has served poor children, their mothers and the disabled.)\n\nBut the expansion has been rejected by many Republican governors and state lawmakers, who, despite growing evidence about the benefit to patients, have argued that Medicaid is ineffective and too costly to states.\n\nThough the law provided federal funding to fully pay for the expansion in 2014, 2015 and 2016, the aid is gradually phased down so that states will ultimately foot 10% of the cost in 2020, a prospect many state lawmakers find worrisome, given doubts about the price tag.\n\nThat means that if a state such as Florida, which has opposed the law, decides in 2017 to expand Medicaid, the state would never get the full federal support.\n\nObama\u2019s new proposal would change that, allowing any state that decides to expand Medicaid eligibility under the law to get three years of full federal funding, no matter when the expansion starts.\n\n\u201cThis common-sense proposal makes the expansion as good a deal for states that expand now as it is for the states that have already done so,\u201d Shaun Donovan, director of the Office of Management and Budget, and Cecilia Mu\u00f1oz, head of the Domestic Policy Council, wrote in a blog posted Thursday morning by the White House.\n\n\u201cIt is further evidence of the Administration\u2019s willingness to work with states to build on recent progress in improving health coverage and making Medicaid affordable to states and taxpayers alike,\" they wrote. \"We hope Congress will act to provide this extra incentive to states that haven\u2019t yet expanded, encouraging them not to miss out on the benefits other states are already enjoying.\u201d\n\nProviding this additional assistance would probably be expensive. The White House did not provide a cost estimate.\n\nIt also would require congressional approval, which is likely to be difficult, given persistent GOP antipathy to the health law. Congressional Republicans this month passed legislation, which Obama vetoed, that would have repealed large sections of the law, including the Medicaid expansion.\n\nFor news on health issues follow @noamlevey on Twitter.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Can Obama persuade reluctant states to expand Medicaid?
