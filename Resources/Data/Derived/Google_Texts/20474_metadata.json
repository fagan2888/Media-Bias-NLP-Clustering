But as we mark on Friday the 14th anniversary of the devastating attacks on the United States, it\u2019s time to admit that the terrorists\u2014at least one specific branch of terrorists\u2014are now winning. And it\u2019s time to admit that our response to the so-called Islamic State has been an abject failure.\n\nLast year, fighters belonging to the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), a group once part of the same organization responsible for the 9/11 attacks stormed into Iraq, conquered half that country, declared itself both a state and a Caliphate and set about to slaughter and enslave thousands of Christians, Shi\u2019a, and members of Islamic minority sects. Fifteen months later, ISIL\u2019s influence has spread far beyond the Levant and Mesopotamia. A thousand foreign recruits converge monthly on its operational cynosure.
