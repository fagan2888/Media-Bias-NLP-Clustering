Elvert Barnes, CC BY-SA 2.0\n\nPanera is taking a page from Chipotle and Tyson Foods and removing about 168 artificial ingredients from its menu, Fortune reported. To be fair, the restaurant chain first announced it was working toward this change, as well as making a more positive impact on the food system, back in 2014.\n\nRon Shaich, founder and CEO of Panera, told Fortune him and his team, \u201care increasingly aware and focused on what is in our food and ridding ourselves of a lot of chemical additives.\u201d The New York Times added this is Shaich\u2019s way of \u201cdrawing a line in the sand\u201d and making it easier for consumers to eat clean. Consumers can download Panera's \u201cNo No List\u201d of the exact preservatives, sweeteners, and flavors it's working to eliminate.\n\nCaffeine and propylene glycol (liquid sweetener) are two of the ingredients on Panera\u2019s sort-of blacklist. Yet, from a scientific perspective, neither of these ingredients has proven to be unsafe. The Atlantic made a similar point regarding aspartame following Pepsi\u2019s announcement to remove the ingredient from Diet Pepsi. In which case, if restaurants don't have the science to back up their decisions, is it food that\u2019s the problem \u2014 or is it what consumers consider to be healthy? Is Panera\u2019s artificial-free menu simply a publicity stunt?\n\nThe opinion of registered dietician Abby Langer, of Abby Langer Nutrition in Toronto, is it\u2019s 70/30: 70 percent PR stunt and 30 percent Panera\u2019s desire to clean up its menu. While caffeine and propylene glycol don\u2019t get a bad rap, other blacklisted ingredients, like HFCS and trans fat, do; in which case, Langer approves Panera\u2019s decision to remove them. But, she explained to Medical Daily in an email, removing ingredients that haven\u2019t proven unsafe fuel consumer \u201cfear of ingredients they can\u2019t pronounce.\u201d\n\n\u201cPanera seems to be playing off the \u2018clean eating\u2019 trend that\u2019s prominent now,\u201d Langer said. \u201cMany of the items at Panera, like their 850-calorie grilled cheese, will still be unhealthy long after any offensive (or not) ingredients are removed from it.\u201d\n\nEating clean refers to consumers who limit as many processed foods (sometimes also meat and dairy) from their diet as possible. Clean eaters source more whole foods into their diet, from fresh fruit and vegetables to whole grains. And to be clear, Langer believes sourcing cleaner ingredients, as well as a restaurant\u2019s willingness to be transparent is a positive; it can just be tricky.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good that Panera is taking out unnecessary ingredients from their food, but don't let that fool you into thinking that their menu is any healthier because overall it's not,\u201d Langer said. \u201cSwitching from HFCS to sugar is 'shuffling the deck chairs,' and there are still plenty of poor choices on their menu.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "panera, bread, removes, over, 150, artificial, ingredients, its, menu, not, all, them, are, bad", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Panera's pledge to remove nearly 170 artificial ingredients from its menu has more to do with consumers' idea of healthy than the food itself.", "title": "Panera Is Dropping Artificial Ingredients, But It's Not The Ingredients' Fault", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/panera-bread-removes-over-150-artificial-ingredients-its-menu-not-all-them-are-bad-332198", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/05/06/panera.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Panera's pledge to remove nearly 170 artificial ingredients from its menu has more to do with consumers' idea of healthy than the food itself.", "title": "Panera Is Dropping Artificial Ingredients, But It's Not The Ingredients' Fault", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/panera-bread-removes-over-150-artificial-ingredients-its-menu-not-all-them-are-bad-332198", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/05/06/panera.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/05/06/panera.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-05-06T14:59:08-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-06T15:42:11-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Panera's pledge to remove nearly 170 artificial ingredients from its menu has more to do with consumers' idea of healthy than the food itself."}, "article_summary": "Panera's pledge to remove nearly 170 artificial ingredients from its menu has more to do with consumers' idea of healthy than the food itself.\nElvert Barnes, CC BY-SA 2.0Panera is taking a page from Chipotle and Tyson Foods and removing about 168 artificial ingredients from its menu, Fortune reported.\nCaffeine and propylene glycol (liquid sweetener) are two of the ingredients on Panera\u2019s sort-of blacklist.\n\u201cSwitching from HFCS to sugar is 'shuffling the deck chairs,' and there are still plenty of poor choices on their menu.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s good that Panera is taking out unnecessary ingredients from their food, but don't let that fool you into thinking that their menu is any healthier because overall it's not,\u201d Langer said."}
