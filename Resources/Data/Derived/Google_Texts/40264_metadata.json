I recognize the number when I see it flash up on the screen. It\u2019s one of the few phone numbers that I know by heart. We\u2019ve been friends for 22 years. Hers were the last digits I learned before we all outsourced our memories to our cell phones. All the other numbers from my past have lost relevancy or don\u2019t connect to the living: street addresses for homes we no longer own, birthdays of grandparents, channels of TV stations, pre-pregnancy shoe size, and of all those landlines long abandoned \u2014 hers was the last working phone number.\n\n828-3886. I answer the phone. \u201cHey, Robin, what\u2019s up?\u201d When you\u2019ve been close friends for over two decades, you can hear the bad news in the sound of their breath. \u201cOh no,\u201d I said, bracing for the news. \u201cI have cancer.\u201d \u201cWhat kind?\u201d \u201cPancreatic.\u201d \u201cPancreatic,\u201d I repeat with a voice I don\u2019t recognize. Or maybe it\u2019s a finality I haven\u2019t heard in my voice until now. It had started as a slight pain in her abdomen earlier in the year. The initial diagnosis was gastritis.\n\nIn recent years, Robin\u2019s greatest pleasures had been her wine-tasting group, gourmand weekends in Napa Valley, and an annual trip to France. She\u2019d even considered cashing out and hightailing it to a wine cave in the Loire Valley. After triumphing over a lifetime of struggle with body issues, wine and anything worth eating would now be denied to her. It seemed impossible that \u201ccut out spicy foods and wine\u201d had progressed to \u201cget your affairs in order\u201d by springtime, but it had.\n\nIn my twenties, all cancers sounded the same to me, but I\u2019m old enough to know that pancreatic is one of those no-one-gets-out-of-here-alive cancers. I voraciously consume the obits, tallying what takes out whom, at what speed and what are the symptoms, and I know that if Steve Jobs couldn\u2019t beat this one, nobody can.\n\nEvery time I pick up the phone, someone\u2019s having a health crisis. In the past, when friends have died it\u2019s seemed like the exception, not the rule, but now all bets are off. There was the cruel swiftness with which AIDS dispatched with my gay friends in the \u201980s and then there was Fernando\u2019s overdose at 39; the actress who was murdered, leaving her young daughter motherless; the neighbor who\u2019d dropped dead from a brain aneurysm on his daily run. Come to think of it, he\u2019d just turned 50. Now every passing year brings news of a friend\u2019s decline or demise. Last month brought a wave of suicides.\n\n\u201cHave you heard about Daniella\u2019s husband? He went off his meds and drove off a cliff. He left a note saying, \u2018I can\u2019t do this anymore.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cTwo young children. Tragic.\u201d \u201cDid you know the comedy writer, Steven Something-Jewish?\u201d \u201cSteven Something-Jewish, oh yeah, it was drugs and alcohol, right?\u201d \u201cIt wasn\u2019t career related, right, wasn\u2019t he always working?\u201d \u201cYes!\u201d \u201cTragic.\u201d \u201cHave you heard about . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. Tragic!\u201d Deena\u2019s brain tumor, Yulissa\u2019s back surgery and Curtis\u2019s irregular heartbeat. \u201cHeart? Heart is good. Just look at Dick Cheney.\u201d If I\u2019m not filling out bring-them-a-meal requests, I\u2019m dropping off medication, driving a friend to get an MRI, making an emergency sour cream run or walking someone\u2019s dog. People are starting to brag about their low cholesterol levels with the enthusiasm once reserved for sexual conquests. I hate that I get a joke with Boniva in the punchline!\n\nBut the news about Robin hit especially hard. She was the person I\u2019ve known the longest since moving to Los Angeles. It can be challenging to make long-lasting friendships after college, but Robin and I had stuck it out. I leaned on Robin like an older sister in the early years of our acquaintance, when our five-year age difference seemed enormous, but over time, the gap had compressed and we\u2019d become peers.\n\nWhen my sulky movie-star boyfriend disappeared overnight and changed his phone number, it was her idea to drive out to a crummy strip mall and chuck the keys to his apartment into the sewer. She knew me well enough to know that having those keys in my possession would be dangerously tempting for me, though in retrospect, I\u2019m sure he had changed his locks as well.\n\nOver the years there\u2019d been times when I\u2019d see that phone number and brace myself for the way her New Jersey nasal whine could inspire guilt in me. \u201cAnnnabeeeelle, it\u2019s Roooobin. Where are you??\u201d But we\u2019d put in the time. My divorce, her career setbacks, my career setbacks, my new marriage, her new career, the birth of my son, her big breakups, her parents\u2019 declining health. We\u2019d been like sisters for two and a half decades and were heading into our third.\n\nOur friendship was tested when she turned 50. She\u2019d woken up convinced that she\u2019d been cheated out of the attention she deserved, having never been married, with no children to birthday party or bar mitzvah. She insisted her closest girlfriends accompany her to sample Syrahs in the Rhone Valley. When none of us could take the trip, she felt betrayed and abandoned. Now, facing this diagnosis, she\u2019d taken me and the rest of her inner circle back.\n\n\u201cNo one will ever have sex with me again.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one\u2019s having sex with you now. At least now you can attend your own group,\u201d I said in an attempt at humor.\n\nAfter an award-winning career of producing stand-up comedy, Robin had gone back to school to become a therapist and had been working as a bereavement facilitator for oncology groups. She knew the landscape ahead of her: punishing rounds of chemo and if she was really, really lucky, she might get a year or two. Later it would make me apoplectic to hear people say, \u201cIt\u2019s ironic that a grief facilitator gets cancer.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot really,\u201d I\u2019d counter. \u201cThat\u2019s like saying it\u2019s extraordinary when your doctor dies. What would be amazing is if they lived forever.\u201d\n\nThere was a certain excitement when she started the treatment, like the third season of a sitcom, when the characters face serious challenges but still fire off hilariously biting one-liners. It was just like Samantha\u2019s breast cancer story line in \u201cSex and the City,\u201d except Robin didn\u2019t have a lavish wardrobe, designer shoe collection, sex, the city, or any chance of recovery. She did still have her sense of humor when she registered the domain name Tumor Humor. She was going to blog about coping with cancer through humor. Chemo was also a great excuse to purchase one or two new sweaters to attractively provide coverage for the port she\u2019d need in her chest and cute fuzzy booties for good measure. Minus her gourmet cuisine and wine, her weight dipped precipitously, but we joked about how she was finally able to lose those pesky last 25 pounds.\n\nAfter only a few months we went from sitcom to Lifetime Movie of the Week. Robin sprang for a human-hair wig styled after Elaine\u2019s \u201cSeinfeld\u201d season-six layered locks, so when her hair fell out, every day was a good hair day. Glowing from the chemo, she really had never looked better. But those good days didn\u2019t last. Her feet swelled up and the comfy booties had to be cast aside. The new sweaters hung loosely from her shrinking frame, her skin began to turn dull and gray and she still hadn\u2019t written more than a few paragraphs of Tumor Humor.\n\nCancer? Not so funny after all. It was terrifying. For her. For all of her friends.\n\nIs there something growing inside me right now that will eventually kill me as well? I\u2019ve always harbored an irrational resistance to washing off fruit. I\u2019ve purposefully, stubbornly refused to rinse it off. Why on earth do I do this? What\u2019s wrong with me? Pesticides are undoubtedly eating away at my insides at this very minute, though statistically speaking, I will probably be bumped off by a teenage driver texting What\u2019s up? or the last thing I will glimpse will be tile. My friend, the futurist and author Dave Freeman, had worked his way through 50 of his Hundred Things to Do Before You Die he\u2019d recommended in his book; he\u2019d survived running with the bulls in Spain and land diving in the South Pacific, but was taken out by a fall in the tub.\n\n\u201cThe 50s are the weeding-out time,\u201d my friend Arye explains. He serves on the pension advisory board of the actor\u2019s union. \u201cWe could never afford to pay pension and health-care benefits if so many people didn\u2019t start dropping dead.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s comforting to know they\u2019re serving a purpose for the greater good.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m a child of the 1970s: I saw \u201cLogan\u2019s Run,\u201d I know that Soylent Green is people and that if we lived forever we\u2019d be unfairly stealing resources that belong to future generations. But when it comes to giving up your seat at the dinner table, most of us prefer to linger for one more coffee and dessert.\n\nRobin wanted to hang on as long as possible, and she needed our help to make that possible. With no spouse, no children, she had only her friends, her chosen family. She didn\u2019t want to return to New Jersey to her mother with Alzheimer\u2019s, father with dementia and strained relationship with her brother and sister-in-law. Isolation from her home and friends would kill her faster than the cancer and make any time she had left miserable, she reasoned, and the troops assembled. Neighbors began dog walking and handled the food shopping. Roommates from college, comedians and members of her wine group showed up to bolster her spirits. Her closest friends began coordinating and accompanying her to doctor\u2019s appointments and chemo, and even sleeping over on a regular basis.\n\nI tried to carve out my usefulness. Her last relationship with a foodie who had run a bacon-of-the- month mail-order business had ended two years before. He left her with a Viking oven and a large collection of wines, but without hope of entering into another relationship. I decided I would start touching her as much as possible. We\u2019d smoke her medical marijuana and then I\u2019d wash her hair. She\u2019d put her head in my lap, and I\u2019d stroke her head and massage her feet.\n\nWithin eight months, we were in Bergman territory. Every time I\u2019d leave her, we\u2019d say goodbye not knowing if this would be that good-bye. There were so many farewells that she was starting to tire of them. It was gut-wrenching.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re losing me, but I\u2019m losing everyone I love all at once.\u201d\n\nRobin couldn\u2019t tolerate even the most soothing of music, watch television or read, and barely rose from her bed. Hospice workers began 24-hour shifts.\n\nEvery day I began bracing for the call that would tell me she had passed, but it didn\u2019t come. I was performing around the country and each time I\u2019d see 828-3386 flash on my phone, I\u2019d answer with the same question. Is this the call? \u201cIt\u2019s not that call, but I think you should come over when you get back in town and say good-bye,\u201d one of her caregivers would say. As soon as my plane would land, I\u2019d drop my suitcases at home, drive to her place, hop into her bed, massage her bony shoulders and lead her through a relaxation exercise I learned from a rabbi. We\u2019re both atheists, but what harm could it do?\n\n\u201cPicture yourself lying on a beach. The sun warms your body. You know, Robin, we should really take you to the beach now that you don\u2019t need to worry about skin cancer! So, imagine your soul rising up into the atmosphere, even though there is no soul separate from the body. Did you know that it was only after people realized that the body deteriorated after death that they needed to conceive of something that was separate from the corporeal body in order to support the idea of resurrection, and that\u2019s how the concept of the soul being untethered to the body became an accepted belief? Anyway, \u2018you,\u2019 whatever that means, rise up to the clouds to Gan Eden, the Garden of Eden, your soul\u2019s true home. I prefer concrete under my feet, but whatever works \u2014 maybe it\u2019s Bergerac or Cahors. Everyone you love and who loves you is waiting for you. I suppose that could be two separate and distinct groups of people. I\u2019m not sure what happens if your grandmother would prefer not to spend the afterlife in the company of your grandfather, which I\u2019m sure is true in my family, but maybe the way it works is that these \u2018souls\u2019 get together to greet you and then they go off to their own corner of heaven with the people they\u2019d prefer to spend eternity with \u2014 anyway, you greet your loved ones and you\u2019re surrounded by love. You\u2019re surrounded by love, Robin. Let go of any stress you\u2019re feeling. Let go. Just let go. Now, slowly return back to your body in a more relaxed state,\u201d I\u2019d repeat.", "article_metadata": {"description": "When Robin got pancreatic cancer, her girlfriends gathered around to support her \u2014 and help her end her life", "title": "The crime we committed for her", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "When Robin got pancreatic cancer, her girlfriends gathered around to support her \u2014 and help her end her life", "title": "The crime we committed for her", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/03/10/the_crime_we_committed_for_her/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/wine_glasses.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "When Robin got pancreatic cancer, her girlfriends gathered around to support her \u2014 and help her end her life", "title": "The crime we committed for her", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/wine_glasses.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Annabelle Gurwitch", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Cancer, Editor's Picks, Euthanasia, Excerpt, friendship, I see you made an effort, Life stories, pancreatic cancer", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc6e5\"", "article_summary": "I was performing around the country and each time I\u2019d see 828-3386 flash on my phone, I\u2019d answer with the same question.\nYou know, Robin, we should really take you to the beach now that you don\u2019t need to worry about skin cancer!\nAfter triumphing over a lifetime of struggle with body issues, wine and anything worth eating would now be denied to her.\nIn the past, when friends have died it\u2019s seemed like the exception, not the rule, but now all bets are off.\nIn my twenties, all cancers sounded the same to me, but I\u2019m old enough to know that pancreatic is one of those no-one-gets-out-of-here-alive cancers."}
