A \u201cconscience\u201d rider would let employers in the District of Columbia refuse health insurance coverage for any service on moral grounds, and hire and fire based on women\u2019s use of health services.\n\nThe White House has vowed to veto each of the dozen spending bills in the works, and Senate Democrats have pledged to filibuster before they can even reach the president.\n\n\u201cFrankly, the fall is shaping up to be the most predictable \u2014 and, really, avoidable \u2014 budget crisis in memory,\u201d said Representative Nita M. Lowey of New York, the ranking Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee.\n\nTwo changes have combined to make this budget season particularly contentious. The first is Republican control of Congress. Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, said the appropriations process was a way for Republicans to block new White House efforts and roll back old ones.\n\nThe other change is budgetary. After a protracted fight over raising the government\u2019s statutory borrowing limit, Congress and Mr. Obama agreed in 2011 to strict spending limits for domestic and defense programs that would last a decade, absent a larger budget deal that overhauled the federal tax code and entitlement programs like Medicare. In the face of those limits, Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, and Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, negotiated a two-year budget deal to lift the caps.\n\nWith the reprieve ending Oct. 1 and Democrats no longer in control of the Senate, Republicans approved a budget this spring demanding adherence to the 2011 restrictions.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe Appropriations Committee in the Senate is reporting out bills consistent with the budget that the Senate passed, and we\u2019re going to move forward,\u201d Mr. McConnell said last month.\n\nWith Democrats promising to vote against any bill that sticks to those limits, Republican appropriators have had to shift spending bills to the right to win the support of Congress\u2019s most conservative members. Mr. Cole called the 10 bills that have passed the Appropriations Committee \u201cthe opening position in a negotiation\u201d that has yet to begin.\n\nBut that position has only strengthened the president\u2019s resolve.\n\nCompounding the problem is the fact that the government will be nearing its statutory borrowing limit in late September, when Pope Francis is to be in Washington, heightening tensions around cuts to social welfare programs.\n\nSenior House Appropriations Committee members, including the panel\u2019s chairman, Representative Harold Rogers of Kentucky, have already told Republican leaders that the time to negotiate a way out of the impasse is now, not in the shadow of the papal visit or a government shutdown Oct. 1, said Representative Charlie Dent, Republican of Pennsylvania and a subcommittee chairman.\n\nShort of that, appropriators will press for quick passage in September of a \u201ccontinuing resolution\u201d to keep the government funded at current levels through December and begin budget talks.\n\n\u201cWe all know there\u2019s going to have to be a short-term C.R. to take us from September to December,\u201d Mr. Dent said. \u201cAnd I would hope sometime between now and then, we\u2019ll have a negotiated budget agreement.\u201d\n\nBut so far, Republican leaders have said little.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a plan that gives him what he wants for defense and keeps the caps in place,\u201d Speaker John A. Boehner said, referring to Mr. Obama\u2019s military spending request, which Congress plans to meet by increasing emergency war funding not subject to the 2011 limits. \u201cAnd if he wants to have a budget negotiation, all he has to do is ask. I\u2019m a pretty reasonable guy.\u201d\n\nWhat the president sees as unreasonable are the bills being drafted to adhere to the caps.\n\nHouse Republican legislation would either reduce full-day, full-year service for 570,000 young children in Head Start or cut 140,000 children from the program altogether, the White House budget office said. That bill would also cut $6.4 billion from the president\u2019s education spending request, and $370 million from the Pell Grant higher education program.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFunding for job training would be almost $500 million less than the White House requested. The National Labor Relations Board\u2019s budget would be cut by nearly a third.\n\nFamily planning would be all but eliminated. National service programs would be cut 42 percent. The Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s operation budget would fall $474 million, or 13 percent. The federal Land and Water Conservation Fund would lose $152 million, or 38 percent. Cuts to the National Park Service as it prepares to celebrate its centennial would delay about 70 percent of its construction projects and more than a third of its repair and rehabilitation efforts.\n\nTo the Republicans drafting those bills, the cuts are about priorities. The same health and labor bill would increase spending on the National Institutes of Health by more than $1 billion and protect the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Higher education aid would be focused on historically black colleges, predominantly Hispanic universities and tribal education.\n\n\u201cThe reality is we still live in a divided government,\u201d Mr. Cole said. \u201cIt\u2019s not as if the Democrats can be shut out, but they can\u2019t dictate to us any more than we can dictate to them. It\u2019s time to sit down and see if we can make a deal.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20150707142543, "twitter": {"description": "Congressional Republicans are using the
