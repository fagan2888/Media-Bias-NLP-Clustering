Small business concerns topped the agenda for a Kansas Congressional incumbent.

Rep. Lynn jenkins stops by Kansas Rehabilitation Hospital on Sept. 29, 2014 (WIBW)

Rep. Lynn Jenkins (R-2nd) toured Kansas Rehab Hospital in Topeka on Monday afternoon after a stop by the Hamm Quarry in Perry.

Jenkins said the top concern she hears from business people is over-regulation from the federal government.

She said she visited the facilities to hear how Washington can be more helpful to them.

Jenkins, who is seeking her fourth term, faces a challenge from Democrat Margie Wakefield.

Wakefield told 13 News that Jenkins is part of the problem facing Kansas Healthcare Providers. Wakefield said Jenkins and the House voted more than 50 times to repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA).

Wakefield said while the ACA is not perfect, but going back to the old system would be a step backward. She said Congress should work toward constructive solutions.
