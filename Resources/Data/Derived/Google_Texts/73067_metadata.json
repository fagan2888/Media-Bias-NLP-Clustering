In a far-reaching survey of more than 14,000 people, Resonate found that only 22% of uninsured plan to purchase insurance through the exchanges. And, demonstrating the need for an aggressive marketing and communications campaign, 27% were completely unaware of the healthcare exchanges.\n\nTwo key groups showed even less awareness, with 33% of non-white uninsured and 30% of uninsured under 35 reporting no knowledge of the exchanges.\n\n\u201cThe big challenge is to communicate to the target market the affordability and convenience of the plans offered by the health exchanges,\u201d said Bryan Gernert, Resonate CEO. \u201cWith our data illustrating cost as a critical driver, the significant discounts offered to many individuals enrolling for the first time will be a tremendous incentive to buy coverage rather than potentially pay a fine.\u201d\n\nWhy the Young Uninsured don't have insurance\n\nResonate also explored why the uninsured lack coverage and what motivates them to make decisions regarding their health. The findings: Affordability is the primary factor behind the lack of insurance, even with younger uninsured consumers.\n\nThis runs counter to conventional wisdom, which says the true challenge is convincing younger people that they are not invincible and need healthcare coverage. Among those aged 18-34, 35% say they lack insurance due to cost, a much higher percentage than the 11% who say they don\u2019t have it because they don\u2019t need it. For younger men, 31% said they could not afford health insurance, more than double the 12% who said they did not need it.\n\nFor all age groups, 37% said they cannot afford insurance, while only 8% said they do not have insurance because they do not need it. Cost is the major reason that those under 35 (35%), non-white consumers (34%) and uninsured families (38%) lack coverage.\n\n\u201cThe traditionally higher cost of health insurance and the lack of employee benefits available to young workers have made health insurance unattainable for too many young adults over the past years. Over the coming year, as many as 17 million currently uninsured young adults could be eligible to enroll in free or discounted insurance plans,\u201d said Tobin VanOstern, adviser for strategic partnerships at Young Invincibles.\n\nThe Uninsured: Motivated To Make Purchases That Are Convenient and Perceived To Improve Their Image\n\nCost is not the only factor that influences the purchase of coverage. Resonate finds the uninsured are 60% more likely than consumers overall to be driven by convenience, rather than cost or brand, when making purchases. And, relative to consumers overall, the uninsured are 29% more likely to make purchases because they help portray a positive image to others; and 24% less likely than consumers overall to make purchases because they promote a healthy lifestyle.\n\nResonate\u2019s ability to combine extensive survey results with thousands of additional data points allows it to help companies, states, and the federal government, better target and market the healthcare exchanges to the uninsured. The company is already working with firms in several states and at the federal level to raise awareness.\n\nAbout Resonate:\n\nResonate lets advertisers and marketers better understand and reach audiences by revealing the motivation behind purchase decisions or support for a cause or candidate.
