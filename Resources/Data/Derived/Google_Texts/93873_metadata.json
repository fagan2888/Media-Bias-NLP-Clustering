Nevertheless, more than 12 percent of all U.S. drivers are uninsured.\n\nIn 2012, the most recent year for which statistics are available, uninsured motorist claims totaled $2.6 billion, a 75 percent increase from the previous decade, according to a recent report by the Insurance Research Council (IRC). Those costs, largely borne by insurance companies, are passed on to insured drivers in the form of higher premiums.\n\nRelated: Why Younger Americans Are Ditching Cars\n\nStates have tried a variety of ways to get motorists to buy car insurance. Some states require drivers registering their cars to show proof of insurance. In many states, uninsured drivers face stiff fines, but some of the states that have such penalties on the books often fail to enforce them. Furthermore, researchers have found that states with stiffer penalties, which can range from a maximum of $200 for a first offense in California to up to $1,500 for a first offense in New York, do not necessarily have the lowest uninsured rates.\n\nPatrick Schmid, the IRC\u2019s director of research, cited a variety of possible reasons for the apparent ineffectiveness of the penalties. \u201cIf the uninsured don\u2019t know the penalties are harsh, how would the penalty sway them?\u201d Schmid said. \u201cAlternatively, perhaps some states with harsh penalties installed them because they already had high rates of uninsured motorists.\u201d\n\nIn some cases, states don\u2019t have the resources to implement the mandates, according to a study by the Financial Responsibility & Insurance Committee, a working group of the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators (AAMVA).\n\nTen states (Alaska, California, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, New Jersey, North Dakota, Oklahoma and Oregon) have \u201cno pay, no play\u201d laws that limit an uninsured driver\u2019s ability to claim damages if he or she is in an accident with an insured motorist. But the IRC found that \u201cno pay\u201d laws had only a modest effect on uninsured rates, reducing them an average of 1.6 percent.\n\nRelated: The 5 Worst Cars at the Detroit Auto Show\n\nOther states require insurers to provide data on all insured drivers, so that the state can match registered cars with insurance policies. But that strategy tends to produce numerous errors, resulting in law-abiding drivers being flagged for not having insurance.\n\nIn 2012, the American Civil Liberties Union challenged a 2010 Indiana law that allowed the state to randomly target drivers who had previously driven without insurance and require them to provide proof of insurance or face suspension of their license. The case was brought to court after a mother of six had her license suspended when she could not prove that she had insurance, even though she did not have a car. The state\u2019s Bureau of Motor Vehicles eventually reinstated the licenses of 4,000 drivers.\n\n\u201cThere are all kinds of schemes out there\u201d to get drivers to comply with state insurance laws, said Mike Chaney, the Mississippi Insurance Commissioner. \u201cBut they haven\u2019t found one that works.\u201d\n\nMajor Barrier Is Poverty\n\nThere is no \u201ctypical\u201d uninsured driver. Some don\u2019t have car insurance because they resent the requirement\u2014\u201cLive Free or Die\u201d New Hampshire is the only state that does not mandate it. Others don\u2019t have it because they are undocumented immigrants who lack driver\u2019s licenses, which are needed to get insurance in many states.\n\nRelated: The New Threat to Your Highway Safety\n\nMost of the uninsured, however, don\u2019t purchase car insurance because they can\u2019t afford it. The number of uninsured drivers peaked at 29.9 million in 2009 during the Great Recession and then dropped to 29.7 million in 2012, the last year for which data are available. Car insurance rates have risen more slowly than other expenses in recent years, but insurance ranks below necessities such as food and housing for drivers struggling to make ends meet.\n\nAccording to the Insurance Information Institute, a New York-based organization that tracks the insurance industry, overall expenditures for car insurance increased by 10 percent between 2010 and 2011, while food expenses increased 21 percent; housing costs increased 29 percent; public transportation costs increased 29 percent and health care costs increased 52 percent.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a racial or immigrant issue,\u201d Chaney of Mississippi said. \u201cIt\u2019s an issue that people cannot afford to pay the money upfront. That\u2019s also true for health insurance, which tends to go hand-in-hand (with car insurance). When you have a large Medicaid population, you have an increase in the number of folks who are living on the edge. They have to make choices about grocery money, buying a car, paying the light bill or paying the rent.\u201d\n\nState Variations\n\nUninsured rates vary greatly from state to state, but they tend to be highest in states with high poverty rates. \u201cAuto insurance has gotten more affordable over the years, but it can still be a difficult purchase for a low-income household,\u201d said James Lynch, the Insurance Information Institute\u2019s chief actuary. \u201cAuto insurance affordability is correlated with the percentage of uninsured motorists. States with lower rates of uninsured motorists tend to have more affordable insurance. States with higher rates of uninsured motorists tend to have less affordable insurance.\u201d\n\nRelated: How Driverless Cars Could Make Roads More Dangerous\n\nOklahoma, which has a poverty rate of 16.8 percent, according to the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s American Community Survey, has the highest percentage of uninsured motorists, at 25.9 percent. Florida\u2019s poverty rate is 17 percent and 23.8 of its motorists are uninsured. Meanwhile, in Mississippi, which has the highest poverty rate in the country at 24 percent, the uninsured rate is 22.9 percent.\n\nMassachusetts has a poverty rate of 11.9 percent, and only 3.9 percent of its motorists are uninsured, the lowest rate in the nation. In Maine, which has a poverty rate of 14 percent, 4.7 percent of its drivers are uninsured, while in New York, which has a poverty rate of 16 percent, 5.3 percent of motorists lack insurance.\n\nBut there is not always a strict correlation between poverty and the uninsured rate. Louisiana, which has the third highest poverty rate in the country, at 19.8 percent, has an uninsured rate of 13.9 percent, only slightly above the national average and considerably lower than its neighbor, Mississippi. Louisiana\u2019s \u201cpay or play\u201d law might have helped keep the uninsured rate down, Chaney suggested.\n\nCalifornia, which has more licensed drivers than any other state, also has the highest number of uninsured motorists\u2014between 3.6 million and 4.1 million, or 14.7 percent. (Its poverty rate is 16.8 percent.) The state has tried since the 1990s to entice motorists to sign up for insurance with the nation\u2019s only state-run program for low-income motorists. But relatively few low-income drivers have taken advantage of the program. The average Californian pays$1,962 per year in auto insurance.\n\nLast week, California Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones announced that his department would step up its recruitment efforts, as the state prepares to offer new licenses to nearly 2 million undocumented immigrants who were previously barred from getting licensed. This year, new motorists signing up for driver\u2019s licenses under the \u201cSafe and Responsible Driver\u2019s Act,\u201d or \u201cAB60,\u201d will be handed a fact sheet advising them that auto insurance is mandatory in the state.\n\n(This week\u2019s injunction blocking President Barack Obama\u2019s executive actions on immigration will not affect implementation of the California law, according to a staff member with the California State Assembly.)\n\n\u201cWe want everyone to have auto insurance,\u201d Jones said. \u201cIt helps the individuals who are driving and provides protection for their families. But it also helps those who might be in an accident with them.\u201d\n\nThis article originally appeared in Stateline, a nonpartisan, nonprofit news service of the Pew Center on the States that provides daily reporting and analysis on trends in state policy.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "In 49 states and the District of Columbia, it\u2019s against the law to drive without car i", "title": "Why Uninsured Drivers Cost Us Over $2.6 Billion a Year", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/20/Why-Uninsured-Drivers-Cost-Us-Over-26-Billion-Year", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/slides/Traffic%20Jams.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/20/Why-Uninsured-Drivers-Cost-Us-Over-26-Billion-Year", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/slides/Traffic%20Jams.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "In 49 states and the District of Columbia, it\u2019s against the law to drive without car i", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddae5\"", "article_summary": "In many states, uninsured drivers face stiff fines, but some of the states that have such penalties on the books often fail to enforce them.\nMeanwhile, in Mississippi, which has the highest poverty rate in the country at 24 percent, the uninsured rate is 22.9 percent.\nBut the IRC found that \u201cno pay\u201d laws had only a modest effect on uninsured rates, reducing them an average of 1.6 percent.\nLouisiana\u2019s \u201cpay or play\u201d law might have helped keep the uninsured rate down, Chaney suggested.\nThe number of uninsured drivers peaked at 29.9 million in 2009 during the Great Recession and then dropped to 29.7 million in 2012, the last year for which data are available."}
