He attributes it, in part, to a growing partisan split among voters.\n\n\u201cIn a lot of these campaigns, the strategies are nationalized because parties think there are fewer voters that are willing to split their tickets,\u201d Kondik said.\n\nFor state-level races ranging from governor to state board of education, ads have run more than 100,000 times that invoked the country\u2019s chief executive or his policies, mostly in a negative light.\n\nAn ad sponsored by Jeremy Oden, a Republican candidate seeking re-election to Alabama\u2019s Public Service Commission\u2014the state\u2019s utility regulator\u2014promises that Oden will \u201cfight Obama and stop the EPA overreach.\u201d\n\nAnother, sponsored by Texas Attorney General candidate Ken Paxton, attacked his Republican primary opponent Dan Branch for lobbying on behalf of unions that \u201cbacked Obama.\u201d\n\nMike Parsons, who lost to Mary Scott Hunter in the primary for the state board of education, made stopping Common Core, which he refers to in that story as \u201cObama-Core,\u201d a central issue in his campaign.\n\nOverall, Republican candidates, and groups supporting Republicans, were responsible for sponsoring 90 percent of all ads that mentioned Obama or the health care law commonly dubbed Obamacare. None of those ads has mentioned the president positively.\n\nDemocrats have invoked Obama far less frequently but, when doing so, they\u2019ve been much more positive, with 9 out of every 10 ads supportive of the president. In one ad, Maryland Lt. Gov. Anthony Brown, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee, touted his work helping to fix the rollout of the president\u2019s health care law and the law\u2019s beneficial effects.\n\nWhile state-level races might seem far removed from the Oval Office, Kondik notes that ads invoking Obama\u2019s health-care law are actually relevant to state races as many aspects of the law\u2014including decisions about expanding Medicaid and creating health care exchanges\u2014have been made at the state level.\n\n\u201cIt may be kind of beside the point to argue whether a gubernatorial candidate is close to Obama,\u201d he said. \u2018\u2019It\u2019s not beside the point to argue whether a candidate supports the Affordable Care Act.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "Republican Party, Barack Obama, u.s. poli, Democratic Party", "publicationDate": 201410020945, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "news_keywords": "Republican Party, Barack Obama, US Politics, Democratic Party", "pageNum": 1, "title": "Even Local School Board Members Are Running Against Obama", "tags": "entity:organization/republican_party,entity:person/barack_obama,topic:politics,entity:organization/democratic_party", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "Just because you\u2019re a small-time local politician doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t hit the President in your ads.", "title": "Even Local School Board Members Are Running Against Obama", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/10/02/even-local-school-board-members-are-running-against-obama.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/10/02/even-local-school-board-members-are-running-against-obama/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1412243121313.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "description": "Just because you\u2019re a small-time local politician doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t hit the President in your ads.", "sectionTaxanomies": "politics", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "Center for Public Integrity", "article": {"section": "politics", "published_time": "2014-10-02T09:45:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/center-for-public-integrityhtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/10/02/even-local-school-board-members-are-running-against-obama", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Even Local School Board Members Are Running Against Obama\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/10/02/even-local-school-board-members-are-running-against-obama.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/10/02/even-local-school-board-members-are-running-against-obama/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/47074770.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/10/02/even-local-school-board-members-are-running-against-obama\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-10-02T09:45:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"Politics\",\"author\":\"Center for Public Integrity\",\"tags\":[\"republican_party\",\"barack_obama\",\"politics\",\"democratic_party\"]}", "authorIds": "/etc/authors/c/center-for-public-integrity", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd6f3\"", "article_summary": "Combined, the more than 300,000 ads aired mention Obama or the health care law.\nAnthony Brown, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee, touted his work helping to fix the rollout of the president\u2019s health care law and the law\u2019s beneficial effects.\nOverall, Republican candidates, and groups supporting Republicans, were responsible for sponsoring 90 percent of all ads that mentioned Obama or the health care law commonly dubbed Obamacare.\nComparatively, more than one-third of political ads in U.S. Senate races have mentioned the president, according to the Center\u2019s analysis.\nBig TimeJust because you\u2019re a small-time local politician doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t hit the President in your ads."}
