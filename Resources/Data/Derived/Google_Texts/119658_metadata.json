As far as most right-wing media is concerned\u2014and definitely as far as the average conservative on the ground is concerned\u2014the problem with the mandate is that it supposedly forces others to \u201cpay for\u201d a woman\u2019s \u201clifestyle\u201d choice. Even though the insurance policies in question actually belong to the women, who usually earned them as part of their compensation packages at work or who paid for directly with premiums, conservatives routinely portray women who use their own insurance to pay for their own medicine as layabouts forcing other people pay for their birth control. Some conservatives even go so far as to erroneously claim that taxpayers are footing the bill for insurance companies to cover contraception.\n\nWhile stoking right-wing resentment over other people\u2019s sex lives is a great way to sell the attacks on Obamacare to the masses, the real question is about whether employers have a right to discriminate if they claim to have religious reasons for doing so. Should employers be able to take away earned benefits from employees because they disapprove of the employee\u2019s private decisions? Or does an employee\u2019s right to religious liberty mean a boss can\u2019t use compensation packages to try to force compliance with religious dictates?\n\nThe answer to the question is about way more than contraception. Indeed, there\u2019s strong reason to believe that the battle over the contraception mandate is just part of a nascent conservative legal strategy to give business owners broad rights to discriminate against people\u2014both customers and employees\u2014on the basis of race, religion, sexual orientation, and gender. The right\u2019s hope is to create a legal structure where business owners can cite religious objections to weasel out of a variety of legal obligations, from the obligation to pay employees what the law says they\u2019re due to the obligation to treat all customers fairly. The attempt to sidestep a federal law stipulating that female employees get basic insurance benefits, including contraception, in exchange for the work they do is just part of this larger movement.\n\nIn fact, attacks on the right of gay customers to be served without being subject to abuse or discrimination is just as big a fight as the one against the contraception mandate. In many states, the battle over gay marriage is morphing into a battle over what conservatives say is a \u201cright\u201d to discriminate based on sexual orientation, so long as you claim Jesus is your reason for doing so. Across the country, right-wing Christian business owners are testing anti-discrimination laws by claiming that they have religious objections to doing things like baking wedding cakes or performing wedding photography for gay couples getting married.\n\nSo far, the pro-discrimination forces have been losing out as judges find that laws barring businesses from discrimination are not suspended just because of religious reasons. However, if the Supreme Court eventually finds that businesses such as Hobby Lobby can discriminate against their employees by refusing to offer federally-mandated health benefits because they disapprove of non-procreative sex, that could dramatically change the legal landscape. After all, it\u2019s going to be hard to say that a business can\u2019t refuse customers on the basis of disapproval of their sexual choices when the same business is allowed to deprive an employee of part of her earned compensation package because they disapprove of her private sexual choices.\n\nThe religious right is not only using attacks on the contraception benefit to help build a broad right to discriminate, but also attacks on women seeking contraception at pharmacies. In recent years, a number of states have passed laws allowing pharmacists to refuse to fill prescriptions if they cite a religious objection. The right claims these laws are necessary because, they say, birth control pills work by \u201ckilling\u201d fertilized eggs. (In reality, the pill works by suppressing ovulation, which means the number of fertilized eggs that die in a woman taking the pill is much lower than in a woman who is using no contraception.) However, in most states the laws are broadly written so that any customer can be turned away if the pharmacist claims to have a religious or moral objection to that person\u2019s choices. As with the objections to the contraception mandate, contraception is just the sexy cover story for the real agenda: Creating a general right to exempt oneself from anti-discrimination laws as long as religion is cited as the motivating factor.\n\nHaving spent years building up the case that religion is an appropriate excuse for discrimination against sexual orientation or contraception preferences, it\u2019s now time for the religious right to make the next move. Arizona lawmakers are trying to pass a new law that would grant the right to defend any kind of discrimination against customers, as long as religion is cited as a reason. The bill\u2019s author, state senator Steve Yarbrough, admits that the law is broad enough that it could allow businesses to refuse to serve Jews or unmarried women\u2014or even refuse to hire them. Yarbrough says that people shouldn\u2019t be overly worried about it, because the discriminating business would have to make the case both that the bigotry is based in sincere religious belief and also that the customer or employee has opportunities to be served or to work elsewhere. But never before have anti-discrimination laws made exceptions for people who use \u201csincerity\u201d as an excuse for their bigotry.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "birth control, Republican Party, u.s. poli", "publicationDate": 201401231045, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "description": "The right wants to use religion as an excuse to legally discriminate against gays and unmarried women\u2014and, ultimately, anyone who doesn\u2019t share their Christian faith.", "pageNum": 1, "title": "The GOPs Birth-Control Trojan Horse", "tags": "entity:medicaltreatment/birth_control,entity:organization/republican_party,topic:politics", "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"The GOP\u2019s Birth-Control Trojan Horse\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/01/23/the-gop-s-birth-control-trojan-horse.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/01/23/the-gop-s-birth-control-trojan-horse/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/46349693.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/01/23/the-gop-s-birth-control-trojan-horse\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-01-23T10:45:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"Politics\",\"author\":\"Amanda Marcotte\",\"tags\":[\"birth_control\",\"republican_party\",\"politics\"]}", "news_keywords": "birth control, Republican Party, US Politics", "sectionTaxanomies": "politics", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "Amanda Marcotte", "article": {"section": "politics", "published_time": "2014-01-23T10:45:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/amanda-marcottehtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/01/23/the-gop-s-birth-control-trojan-horse", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "The right wants to use religion as an excuse to legally discriminate against gays and unmarried women\u2014and, ultimately, anyone who doesn\u2019t share their Christian faith.", "title": "The GOP\u2019s Birth-Control Trojan Horse", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/01/23/the-gop-s-birth-control-trojan-horse.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/01/23/the-gop-s-birth-control-trojan-horse/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1390490817112.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "authorIds": "/etc/authors/a/amanda-marcotte", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe22c0\"", "article_summary": "Or does an employee\u2019s right to religious liberty mean a boss can\u2019t use compensation packages to try to force compliance with religious dictates?\nThe religious right is not only using attacks on the contraception benefit to help build a broad right to discriminate, but also attacks on women seeking contraception at pharmacies.\nShould employers be able to take away earned benefits from employees because they disapprove of the employee\u2019s private decisions?\nSome conservatives even go so far as to erroneously claim that taxpayers are footing the bill for insurance companies to cover contraception.\nBut never before have anti-discrimination laws made exceptions for people who use \u201csincerity\u201d as an excuse for their bigotry."}
