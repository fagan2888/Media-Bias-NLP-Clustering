Bielsa said he changed his mind because Marseille officials allegedly amended the terms of the new deal at the last minute.\n\nMarseille\u2019s board of directors hit back Sunday, saying that the club \u201ccan\u2019t submit itself to a single man\u2019s rule.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn no instance can Marseille be held prisoner of the demands of someone who puts his own interests well above those of the institution,\u201d Marseille said in a statement.\n\nBielsa, who said goodbye to his players at Marseille\u2019s training center on Sunday morning, has been linked with a move to Mexico as a possible replacement for fired national coach Miguel Herrera but he insists he did not quit with another job lined up.\n\nBielsa took over in 2014 and was widely credited for Marseille\u2019s return to form last season with his brand of attacking football. Marseille was in contention for the league title before a run of four straight defeats in April ended those hopes.\n\nThe nine-time champions ultimately finished fourth, and allowed Andre-Pierre Gignac, Andre Ayew, Dimitri Payet, and Jeremy Morel to leave. The departures angered the fans, but Marseille compensated their loss with the signing of talented young players, and the arrival of veterans Lassana Diarra and Abou Diaby.\n\nBielsa, who criticized club president Vincent Labrune for keeping him away from the recruitment process when he took his job, said this week he was \u201csatisfied with the squad.\u201d\n\nLabrune was stunned by Bielsa\u2019s resignation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m struggling to understand how Wednesday\u2019s meeting on technical details of the deal (for Bielsa) \u2026 created this hasty departure,\u201d Labrune said.\n\nBielsa\u2019s assistant coach, Franck Passi, is interim coach.\n\nIn 2004 Bielsa led Argentina to the Olympic title and runner-up in the Copa America.
