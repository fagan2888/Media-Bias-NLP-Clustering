Neither party bears much resemblance to its past counterpart, and the bipartisanship that carried the day then is now all but dead.\n\nThat\u2019s true, though let\u2019s not brush past the contextual details. Bipartisanship was possible a half-century ago because there was a Republican minority in 1964 that included liberal lawmakers eager to compromise. That GOP is clearly long gone.\n\nCongress is deadlocked on every big question, from immigration reform to a grand bargain on taxes and spending\u2026. Now Boehner is suing President Barack Obama for failing to faithfully execute the laws, and Reid inveighs daily about the Koch brothers\u2019 contributions to GOP causes.\n\nThat\u2019s also true, but again, the details matter. On immigration, debt reduction, tax policy, and government spending \u2013 the specific issues Purdum highlighted \u2013 Democrats have demonstrated a willingness to compromise. Republicans have done the opposite.\n\nI\u2019m also not sure I see the parallel between Reid complaining about far-right billionaires financing a massive campaign operation and Boehner trying to stop the president from governing.\n\nBut the larger point \u2013 there\u2019s a growing chasm between the governing parties \u2013 is certainly true, and this dynamic makes it easy to imagine how ugly and painful a debate over the Civil Rights Act would be if it were under consideration this year.\n\nAll of this, though, got me thinking. If the Civil Rights Act couldn\u2019t pass in 2014, what else would fail?\n\nWe talked last week, for example, about the 70th anniversary of the G.I. Bill, which would probably struggle to pass today. Indeed, it faced far-right opposition at the time, which it overcame, but the far-right obviously has vastly more power and control today than in 1944.\n\nBut would Social Security be approved? Almost certainly not. Many congressional Republicans make no secret of the fact that they\u2019re eager to privatize the system.\n\nWould Medicare pass? It\u2019s hard to see how. If Republicans set their hair on fire over the Affordable Care Act, which relies largely on private insurers to help Americans access medical care, GOP opposition to socialized insurance would be a non-starter. For that matter, like Social Security, today\u2019s Republicans boast about their desire to privatize Medicare out of existence.\n\nThe Interstate Highway System would clearly struggle to gain Republican support \u2013 it\u2019s a massive federal infrastructure investment, which the GOP steadfastly rejects \u2013 as would the Transcontinental Railroad, for the same reason.\n\nRural electrification programs probably couldn\u2019t pass \u2013 why should Big Government help isolated communities turn their lights on? \u2013 and the very idea of Washington investing in the Marshall Plan today seems rather laughable.\n\nAt a certain level, I can appreciate why this little exercise is unsatisfying. The answer to every \u201cWould Congress pass _________ today?\u201d question is the same, given that Congress seems incapable of passing much of anything on any subject. But the point is, the radicalization of one governing party has not only paralyzed federal lawmaking, it\u2019s created conditions that would leave most of America\u2019s major legislative landmarks behind.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "It's speculative, obviously, but does anyone seriously question whether the congressman is correct about what's possible in today's Congress?", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/john-lewis-civil-rights-act-would-not-pass-today", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "It's speculative, obviously, but does anyone seriously question whether the congressman is correct about what's possible in today's Congress?", "title": "John Lewis: Civil Rights Act 'would not pass' today", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/john-lewis-civil-rights-act-would-not-pass-today", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/articles/ap101699124296_0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "title": "John Lewis: Civil Rights Act 'would not pass' today", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/john-lewis-civil-rights-act-would-not-pass-today", "image": {"width": 830, "identifier": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/articles/ap101699124296_0.jpg?itok=LqF-pMuX", "height": 553}, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "It's speculative, obviously, but does anyone seriously question whether the congressman is correct about what's possible in today's Congress?"}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2014-07-03T08:01:11-04:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/msnbc", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/steve.benen"}, "abstract": "It's speculative, obviously, but does anyone seriously question whether the congressman is correct about what's possible in today's Congress?", "nv": {"author": "steve-benen", "title": "John Lewis: Civil Rights Act 'would not pass' today", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/john-lewis-civil-rights-act-would-not-pass-today", "published": 1, "date": "07/03/2014 08:01:11 EDT", "tags": "civil-rights,congress,john-lewis,republicans,rachel-maddow-show"}, "news_keywords": "Republicans, Civil Rights, Congress, John Lewis"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccd9b\"", "article_summary": "If the Civil Rights Act couldn\u2019t pass in 2014, what else would fail?\nWriting in Politico yesterday , Todd Purdum accepted the premise, agreeing that the landmark measure \u201ccouldn\u2019t pass today,\u201d and highlighted the shifts in the political landscape.\nThe answer to every \u201cWould Congress pass _________ today?\u201d question is the same, given that Congress seems incapable of passing much of anything on any subject.\nAnd so it matters when Lewis declares , on the 50th anniversary of the enactment of the Civil Rights Act, \u201cIf the Civil Rights Act was before the Congress today, it would not pass, it would probably never make it to the floor for a vote.\u201dIt\u2019s speculative, obviously, but does anyone seriously question whether this is true?\nCongress arguably has no greater champion of American civil rights than Rep .John Lewis (D) of Georgia, whose lifelong commitment and years of sacrifice give him unrivaled stature on the issue."}
