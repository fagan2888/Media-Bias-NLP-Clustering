After Republicans voted to pass a largely unpopular spending bill to avoid a government shutdown, Levin insisted that his loyalty to the GOP is growing increasingly strained.\n\n\u201cI want to tell the Republican Party, the RNC, the NRSC, the NCCC, the NAACP, whatever they call themselves in the Republican Party,\u201d he began, \u201cI am one inch away from leaving you; and I\u2019ll bet I speak for hundreds of thousands of people. One inch.\u201d\n\nHis rant continued to include allegations against GOP leaders he believes are more interested in their own political careers than the best interest of those who elected them.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\n\u201cYou think this is a joke?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou think you can lie to the American people? You think you can lie to Republicans and lie to conservatives about how you\u2019re going to defund ObamaCare, run millions of dollars in ads on that to get reelected? On how you\u2019re going to fight unconstitutional amnesty tooth and nail? You think you can lie to us with impunity and repeatedly?\u201d\n\nLevin decried the apparent disconnect between the rhetoric and actions of many Republican leaders.\n\nHe said they go \u201con and on about an imperial president, on and on about how he\u2019s undermining the Constitution\u201d but \u201ccan\u2019t even vote on a point of order challenging him because you\u2019re a bunch of children.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nMeanwhile, he asserted, truly principled conservative senators like Ted Cruz and Mike Lee are lambasted by the GOP leaders on the receiving end of his philippic.\n\nAs for the argument that the recently passed continuing resolution was needed to avoid a government shutdown, Levin put that contention in perspective by using his former boss, Ronald Reagan, as an example.\n\n\u201cI worked for a president who shut down the d\u2013n government over a half a dozen times,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not the end of the world and it wasn\u2019t the end of the world last year. Our Constitution is in tatters \u2026 and you just voted, many of you, to rubber stamp what Obama did.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201cYou think you can lie to the American people?\"", "author": "B.
