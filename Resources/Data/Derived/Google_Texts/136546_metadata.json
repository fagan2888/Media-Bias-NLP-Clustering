Now 29, she lives in Manchester with her husband and three-month-old daughter.\n\n..\n\nAfter graduating from Nashua North, she got her B.S. in ceramic arts and entrepreneurship from Syracuse University, was artist in residence at a program in Maine, then completed a graduate degree at the University of North Carolina in city planning.\n\n..\n\n\u201cAfter school, I was given the option of two different life dreams of mine,\u201d she said, \u201cto build a community arts center in an old mill building, or to go to Cambodia on a Fulbright Scholarship. \u201cFortunately for Manchester, she chose the former. \u201cThe reason was for family,\u201d she said.\n\n..\n\nThat long-term decision led her to take over a building that had been occupied by her family\u2019s Asian market. Her planning skills were put to the test as she served as general contractor for the renovation of the space that now serves as Studio 550.\n\n..\n\nWhile many Manchester residents or visitors may not be familiar with the classes and studio work that goes on behind the walls of the arts center, the public impact of the organization is hard to miss.\n\n..\n\nThere\u2019s the annual \u201cMonsters on the Loose\u201d program, in which 100 small clay monsters are hidden throughout the downtown in a sort of scavenger hunt. Studio 550 is also the moving force behind \u201cThink Outside the Box,\u201d in which artists paint utility boxes in the downtown area, turning eyesores into beautiful public art.\n\n..\n\nIn just two years of operating Studio 550, Leap has come a long way toward her goal of \u201cbuilding a dynamic and thriving community based around the arts.\n\n..", "article_metadata": {"description": "She is certainly an accomplished artist in her chosen field of ceramics, but she is not struggling financially and is certainly not working in isolation.", "title": "Monica Leap: Architect of a thriving arts community | New Hampshire", "og": {"site_name": "UnionLeader.com", "description": "She is certainly an accomplished artist in her chosen field of ceramics, but she is not struggling financially and is certainly not working in isolation.", "title": "Monica Leap: Architect of a thriving arts community | New Hampshire", "url": "http://www.unionleader.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20150126/NEWS0202/150129304", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.unionleader.com/storyimage/UL/20150126/NEWS0202/150129304/AR/0/AR-150129304.jpg?q=70?ExactW=600&ExactH=314&imageversion=MainHighlight&q=80", "height": 314}, "type": "article"}, "section": "40 Under Forty", "robots": "NOARCHIVE, NOODP, NOYDIR", "keywords": "General News, Manchester,", "fb": {"app_id": 665237656918292}, "date": "2015-01-26 00:00:00", "twitter": {"description": "She is certainly an accomplished artist in her chosen field of ceramics, but she is not struggling financially and is certainly not working in isolation.", "title": "Monica Leap: Architect of a thriving arts community | New Hampshire", "url": "http://www.unionleader.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20150126/NEWS0202/150129304", "image": "/storyimage/UL/20150126/NEWS0202/150129304/AR/0/AR-150129304.jpg?q=70", "site": "@UnionLeader", "card": "summary$t"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Monica Leap: Architect of a thriving arts communityMANCHESTER \u2014 Monica Leap defies the stereotype of the struggling artist working in isolation.\nIn just two years of operating Studio 550, Leap has come a long way toward her goal of \u201cbuilding a dynamic and thriving community based around the arts.\nHer planning skills were put to the test as she served as general contractor for the renovation of the space that now serves as Studio 550.\nInstead, she has in the past two years built the Studio 550 Arts Center at 550 Elm St. into a vibrant force for the arts in downtown Manchester, enlivening the community with public art projects, classes for all ages and affordable studio space.\n..\u201cAfter school, I was given the option of two different life dreams of mine,\u201d she said, \u201cto build a community arts center in an old mill building, or to go to Cambodia on a Fulbright Scholarship."}
