Last year, Pod Pack made 100 million coffee pods.\n\n\u201cWe do a lot of hotel brands,\u201d said Tom Martin, Pod Pack\u2019s executive vice president and chief operating officer. Some of the chains that use the company\u2019s products include Starwood Hotels, Holiday Inn and some Marriott properties. \u201cIf there\u2019s a single-cup coffee system in a hotel room, it probably uses our pods.\u201d\n\nPod Pack serves as a private label packer, working with various coffee roasting companies. For example, the company is making the pods Taco Bell is now using for its recently introduced breakfast menu.\n\n\u201cUsually the coffee roaster figures out the blend, what they want the coffee to taste like,\u201d he said. \u201cThey turn to us to figure out how to grind it, how much to put in the pod, to measure the extraction yield and to quantify what people are tasting.\u201d\n\nUnlike other companies that make single-serving pods or cups of coffee grounds, Pod Pack doesn\u2019t sell its own brand of coffee or tea, choosing instead to concentrate on taking care of its customers.\n\nTo keep up with demand, Pod Pack announced last month it would spend $10.1 million to expand its manufacturing facility on Industriplex Boulevard.\n\n\u201cIt just seems like an overnight success,\u201d said Martin, sitting back in an office that has the strong warm scent of coffee beans.\n\nMartin and Bill Powell, Pod Pack\u2019s president and CEO, started the company in the mid-1990s. Martin had just left Community Coffee after spending 11 years with the company, and Powell had just sold his business, which made coffee filters.\n\n\u201cBill and I had known each other a long time,\u201d Martin said. \u201cHe was in the coffee filter-making business. I was in the coffee business. We knew a lot of people that owned or ran coffee businesses around the country.\u201d\n\nAt the time, there was a demand from restaurants for single-cup espresso machines. The restaurants were investing in the machines in order to keep diners at their table and not heading out to a nearby coffee shop for an after-dinner drink.\n\n\u201cWe knew people were buying these espresso pods, and we decided we could do it better,\u201d Martin said. At the time, the pods were coming from Europe and the Northeast, so the thinking was Pod Pack could establish itself out of the South.\n\nMartin said he and Powell had no idea how big the market was for espresso pods.\n\n\u201cWe really didn\u2019t have a clear picture of what we were getting into,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had a concept that single-cup brewing would be something in the future.\u201d\n\nThe business opened in 1996 in New Orleans. Pod Pack started in the Crescent City because it was the largest green coffee port in the U.S.\n\n\u201cOur idea was that roasters would go down to New Orleans and pick up green coffee and drop off roasted whole beans for our pods,\u201d Martin said. \u201cBut that only worked for one customer.\u201d\n\nIn 2000, Pod Pack moved to Baton Rouge to take a suite on Industriplex Boulevard. The move worked for Martin, who no longer had to commute from his home in Baton Rouge to New Orleans. And Powell is based in New Jersey, so he wasn\u2019t affected.\n\nSince then, the business has spread to take up one entire building in an office park.\n\nPod Pack would not release sales figures, but Martin said annual revenue doubled from 2012 to 2013 and is on track to double again this year.\n\nThat tracks the rapid growth of the single-serve coffee business. In 2010, 4 percent of coffee drinkers were brewing single cups of java. That number has grown to 29 percent of the coffee market, Martin said.\n\n\u201cPeople are predicting 20 percent growth in single-cup brewing over the next four to five years,\u201d Martin said. \u201cThat\u2019s significant.\u201d\n\nPod Pack has seen that growth happen, even though the company has concentrated on making coffee pods and not the more popular single-serve cups.\n\nWhile the single-serve cups work by having a high-pressure jet of water pumped through a foil covered plastic container, the pods sold by Pod Pack are coffee grounds wrapped in a filter.\n\nNot only does this lead to a better tasting cup of coffee, but the pods are 10 to 15 cents cheaper than a single-serve cup and more environmentally friendly. \u201cOnly 10 percent of the product right here isn\u2019t biodegradable,\u201d Martin said.\n\nMintel, a market research firm based in London, said in 2013 U.S. consumers spent $3.1 billion on single-cup coffee and $6 billion on traditional roasted coffee. But by 2018 the company expects the gap between single cups and roasted coffee will be down to $1.4 billion.\n\nThe change is largely being driven by convenience, Martin said. Customers are even willing to sacrifice the quality of making a full pot of coffee for the ease of a single-serving cup, he said.\n\nAs part of the new expansion, which will add 19 employees to Pod Pack\u2019s staff of about 25, the company will install a machine that packages single-serve cups of coffee.\n\n\u201cOur customers consider us to be the experts, and they were saying \u2018Hurry up and get in the cup business, we don\u2019t want to deal with anybody else,\u2019\u201d Martin said. \u201cThat makes me confident buying a cup machine will work out.\u201d\n\nThe expansion will bring the size of Pod Pack\u2019s operations to 60,000 to 100,000 square feet \u2014 Martin is still determining how big he wants to go.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t guess how long this growth is going to continue,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a little overwhelming what we should do, but you don\u2019t want to miss a growth opportunity.\u201d\n\nFollow Timothy Boone on Twitter @TCB_TheAdvocate", "article_metadata": {"description": "Baton Rouge, LA /News/Business/: It may have taken a little while to catch on, but Pod Pack has seen rapid growth over the past few years.
