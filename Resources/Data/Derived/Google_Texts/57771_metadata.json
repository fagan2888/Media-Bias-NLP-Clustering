He single-handedly forced the government shutdown, which his own colleagues said was a suicide note.\u201d\n\nBrock outlined a general-election battle that would focus on social issues where he believes Cruz is \u201cwildly out of touch with American voters.\u201d He listed Cruz\u2019s position on a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage, \u201cpersonhood\u201d legislation, and contraception. \u201cThose are the kinds of issues that are going to be raised, and there\u2019s an awful lot to talk about with Ted Cruz.\u201d\n\nSure, Cruz raising money to run ads against the gutless wonders who ran as conservatives and then betrayed the American people as liberals\u2026that one\u2019s really going to get people fired up\u2026in support of Cruz. Of course, we know that a good Republican would never raise money to run ads against another Republican\u2026the way RINO Thad Cochran did to smear Chris McDaniel as a faux \u201cracist\u201d in Mississippi\u2026or lead people to believe anti-amnesty Republicans were some kind of racists the way Marco Rubio\u2019s amnesty gang did. Oh no, only Ted Cruz would run ads against another Republican.\n\nAnd yeah, that government shutdown was really a \u201csuicide note\u201d for the 2014 election, wasn\u2019t it? (For Democrats, maybe.)\n\n\n\nSure, Cruz dragging the feckless GOP \u201cleadership\u201d to (almost) do what they\u2019d campaigned on doing for four years (i.e. stop ObamaCare) and that the American people wanted them to do since before that socialist abomination was devised\u2026yeah, that was a real disaster for the GOP.\n\nAnd Brock\u2019s other ideas of \u201cchinks in the armor\u201d of Cruz are about as good.\n\nAnd banning counterfeit marriage (which over 40 states banned until judicial activists overruled the federal constitution, state constitutions and the will of the people), that one\u2019s real unpopular too\u2026with liberals who would never give Ted Cruz the time of day in a million years anyway.\n\nOh, and recognizing people who are genetically complete human beings from conception as \u201cpersons\u201d is a real anchor around the ankle\u2026for Democrats who have been denying the personhood of human beings they found inconvenient since Dred Scott.\n\nAnd Ted Cruz\u2019s complete lack of a problem with women buying their own contraception as they see fit\u2013that\u2019ll doom him for sure.\n\nI\u2019m sure Cruz is quaking in his boots over what his former college roomate thinks of him, too. Why, liberals always have glowing testimonies about solid conservatives\u2026unless they\u2019re Ted Cruz, right? I\u2019ve had some roommates in the barracks during my time in the Air Force with whom I didn\u2019t get along and vice versa\u2026sometimes to become good friends later on when we didn\u2019t have to live with each other. From the description of his complaints about Cruz, it sounds like Craig Mazin may have been jealous of Ted\u2019s success with the ladies (Cruz was described by some in college as \u201csort of a stud\u201d with the ladies). And since Cruz was a debate champ, that may have only fueled Mazin\u2019s envy. Also, considering that Cruz\u2019s Jamaican college friend David Panton described Cruz as \u201cconsistent,\u201d that wouldn\u2019t win Cruz any points with a liberal (liberals thrive on inconsistency and mushiness). And the fact that some seem to marvel that Cruz could go through all those years of Ivy League education and still come out conservative\u2026well, that means he\u2019s \u201ccalcified\u201d (decent people would consider that being commendably resistant to Leftist indoctrination). It\u2019s a wonderful thing to be criticized and demonized by the right people (trust my experience on that one).\n\nFrom what I\u2019ve seen from this little whiner (darn that Ted for hitting the snooze button too much), he seems to be a typical Ivy League Leftist, and Leftists are notoriously disconnected from reality, as well as very prone to lie like bandits (it\u2019s par for the course with their contempt for morality and objective truth). Sorry, libs; if you demonstrate contempt for reality and truth, don\u2019t be surprised if no one listens when you cry wolf.\n\nKeep on drinking your own Koolaid, Leftists. It\u2019s hilarious to watch. Might I say, it\u2019s even Hillary-ous.\n\n\n\nThis article is printed with the permission of the author(s).
