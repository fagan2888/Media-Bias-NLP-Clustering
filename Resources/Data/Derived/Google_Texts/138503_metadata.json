Some people are saying that this may, in fact, wind up with a Republican-controlled Senate. And it will be the cause of Obamacare. It is still by every poll still unpopular. DAN PFEIFFER: Well, first I\u2019d say we believe we\u2019re going to keep the Senate. But look, health care is a divisive issue. It\u2019s been that way for a very long time. That\u2019s where it took 15 years to get health reform passed. I do think that the Republican argument for repeal is a political loser. What they\u2019re arguing now is that the seven million people who signed up through the exchanges and the millions more who got it from Medicaid and other ways, they\u2019re going to take health care away from all of those people. And then what they\u2019re going to do for the 85% of Americans who had health care before the Affordable Care Act is that they\u2019re going to take away their protections. Because embedded in the Affordable Care Act is the patient\u2019s bill of rights. So we\u2019ll go back to the days where women paid more than men for the same health care, seniors paid more for prescription drugs, and insurance companies had all the power. That\u2019s not a good argument to make.\n\nDemocrats far and wide should be explaining what the Republican plan to repeal Obamacare would mean for every single American. In the simplest terms, Republicans want to revert back to a system where insurance companies can drop a person when they get sick, and people with pre-existing conditions can\u2019t get coverage.\n\nAs more people sign up for the ACA, the more the debate is tilting towards the Democrats. Republicans are playing a losing hand if they think that the millions of Americans are going to support taking away their own healthcare. What Republicans don\u2019t get is that people don\u2019t want to go back to the old system, but all the GOP continues to offer is a return to the way things were before.\n\nTheir argument is definitely a political loser, but Democrats will only win if they stand up and tell voters what will really happen if the ACA is repealed.\n\nThe White House is on the offensive, and determined to make the Republicans pay for campaigning on repealing Obamacare.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Obama White House has been emboldened by the good news on the ACA and is calling the Republican plan to repeal Obamacare a political loser.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Jason Easley", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "The Obama White House has been emboldened by the good news on the ACA and is calling the Republican plan to repeal Obamacare a political loser.", "title": "Obama White House Calls The Republican Argument to Repeal Obamacare a Loser", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2014/04/06/obama-white-house-calls-republican-argument-repeal-obamacare-loser.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/obama-big-point.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-04-06T15:23:13+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "published_time": "2014-04-06T15:23:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-04-06T15:23:13+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The Obama White House has been emboldened by the good news on the ACA and is calling the Republican plan to repeal Obamacare a political loser.\nDemocrats far and wide should be explaining what the Republican plan to repeal Obamacare would mean for every single American.\nAnd then what they\u2019re going to do for the 85% of Americans who had health care before the Affordable Care Act is that they\u2019re going to take away their protections.\nThe White House is on the offensive, and determined to make the Republicans pay for campaigning on repealing Obamacare.\nI do think that the Republican argument for repeal is a political loser."}
