It is the first time the list has been made public. Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives have sponsored a bill that would require the Fed to divulge that information publicly.\n\nSupporters of the Fed say the world's leading central bank needs top talent, and note that its expenses are not covered by taxpayers, but by the income it earns on securities it holds. Critics, however, think the Fed has too much discretion.\n\n\"It certainly bolsters the case for more oversight,\" said Maggie Seidel, a spokeswoman for New Jersey Republican Scott Garrett, a co-sponsor of the bill.\n\nAs of July 31, the Fed's inspector general led the list with an annual salary of $312,000, followed by the central bank's four division directors, its general counsel and its chief operating officer, who each earn a base of $265,000.\n\nDespite the relatively high pay of senior managers at the Fed board, the average salary of all its staffers was $121,279, excluding benefits, a figure that lags behind other financial regulators.\n\nRelated: Yellen, LaGarde and a New Era for Women in Finance\n\nAt the Securities and Exchange Commission, the average salary was $157,946 in 2013, while at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation it was about $130,000. The average at the Commodities Futures Trading Commission was $146,323.\n\nFormer Senator Ted Kaufman said it was important for the central bank to hire and retain talented staff who could fetch more in the private sector. Managing directors at large investment banks, for example, usually earn a salary around $250,000 and pull in bonuses that in good times can be double or triple that amount.\n\nNevertheless, the Delaware Democrat said tracking the Fed's costs was a legitimate concern.\n\n\"In the private sector, every business has incentives to keep costs down. In government, you have to overcome the issue that there is no natural need to keep costs down,\" Kaufman said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The top 113 earners among staff at the Federal Reserve's Washington headquarters make", "title": "You Won\u2019t Believe How Many People at the Fed Make More Than Janet Yellen", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/10/17/You-Wont-Believe-How-Many-People-Fed-Make-More-Janet-Yellen", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Janet%20Yellen.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/10/17/You-Wont-Believe-How-Many-People-Fed-Make-More-Janet-Yellen", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Janet%20Yellen.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The top 113 earners among staff at the Federal Reserve's Washington headquarters make", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Related: Janet Yellen: Brawny, Brave, and Brooklyn StrongHowever, the central bank only provided salaries for staff who make at least $225,000 a year, with some exceptions.\nYellen, whose salary is set by Congress, earns $201,700 a year.\nFormer Senator Ted Kaufman said it was important for the central bank to hire and retain talented staff who could fetch more in the private sector.\nRepublicans in the U.S. House of Representatives have sponsored a bill that would require the Fed to divulge that information publicly.\nSupporters of the Fed say the world's leading central bank needs top talent, and note that its expenses are not covered by taxpayers, but by the income it earns on securities it holds."}
