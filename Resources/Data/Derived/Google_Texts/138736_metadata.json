Oh sweet little baby Jesus, no!\n\nThe \u201cAnnie Oakley of the Airwaves\u201d writes at Matt Barber\u2019s BarbWire that,\n\nAnyone or anything connected with the God of the Holy Bible will be attacked and bypassed by Obama and his progressive robots. As we all know by now Obama had no congratulations or words of any kind for Benjamin Netanyahu though BiBi won huge. Funny how all the other \u2018big boy\u2019 leaders called to congratulate him but not Obama. John Kerry saying something pathetic from afar and too late doesn\u2019t cut the cheese folks. Obama is most certainly against Netanyahu because he represents the Jews and Israel and won\u2019t be intimidated into giving away more land or kissing up to the Islamic agenda\u2026.which is simply \u2014 destroy Israel.\n\nThat\u2019s quite a leap (of faith, shall we say?). Not a word here about how her pal \u201cBibi\u201d came to the United States and tried to wrest control of America\u2019s foreign policy away from the man in whom that control is vested by the United States Constitution: the President of the United States.\n\nThat would be Barack H. Obama.\n\nIt was a coup attempt, pure and simple.\n\nA simple appeal to human nature would be enough to tell most people Obama isn\u2019t going to rush to a phone and congratulate the man who did this to him. Who would? The worst thing that could happen for the peace process was a Netanyahu victory. It makes Obama\u2019s job of securing a nuclear weapons-free future with Iran that much more difficult.\n\nNow what \u201cDoctor\u201d Roth fails to understand is that while \u201cBibi\u201d has a right to a foreign policy, so does the United States. If Roth is so eager for war, she should make sure she is first in line at the recruiting office the morning Israeli jets attack Iran.\n\nAnd to automatically accuse Obama of being anti-Israel because he opposes Netanyahu is absurd. Not surprising, because the same defense was used of Bush\u2019s attack on Iraq in 2003. If you oppose Bush you oppose the United States and if you oppose the United States you oppose God himself.\n\nThen Roth gets all dramatic. \u201cLet\u2019s cut to the bottom line,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cObama has invested, committed to and is passionate about completing his transformational plans for America,\u201d and I guess we have to give her credit for recognizing that Congress is \u201cbehind in every area.\u201d\n\nShe wants them to \u201cfight Obama and his evil transformation plans\u201d (good luck with that; they\u2019re too busy fighting each other over how extreme they want to be):\n\nThat means, regular and thought out media statements\u2026defunding all that Obama touches, such as Obamacare, the FCC Internet take over, amnesty for starters. \u201cUse the power you have.\u201d\n\nA \u201cthought-out\u201d media statement? From a Republican?\n\nTalk about not having a prayer\u2026\n\nSo Obamacare, which gives healthcare to up to 20 million people (and incidentally, promises my son a future), is \u201cevil and transformational.\u201d The FCC \u201cInternet take over\u201d [sic] (Should be one word, \u2018takeover\u2019 Doc), which is actually just the preservation of the open Internet we\u2019ve always had, and long overdue, is also \u201cevil and transformational,\u201d and amnesty! I\u2019m not sure whatever happened to the much-vaunted Christian charity but it is nowhere in evidence at BarbWire.\n\nBut she\u2019s not through drowning in nonsense, claiming that \u201cObama believes down to his bone marrow in a one world Government and that America must submit to the UN instead of our US Constitution, sovereignty and Judeo/Christian values\u201d (she provides no evidence for this, of course).\n\nAs for Obama, well\u2026\n\n\u201cHis heart and mind set are all wrapped up in Communism, fascism, creating an Islamic caliphate, and Internationalism.\u201d\n\nShe needs to plop that tinfoil hat down on her head right now. Try to wrap your head around somebody being all these things at once:\n\nA. A communist\n\nB. A fascist\n\nC. A radical Islamist\n\nD. An \u201cinternationalist\u201d\n\nThere can be no \u201call of the above\u201d so there is no choice \u201cE.\u201d Fascism was an early 20th century response TO communism and diametrically opposed to it, the extreme right vs. the extreme left. A theocrat, which is what a radical Islamist would have to be, is something completely different from the other two. And I\u2019m not even sure how to response to the charge of being an \u201cinternationalist.\u201d If it means no country is above the law, then I fail to see what her complaint is.\n\nThere follows the inevitable nonsense about being persecuted, and then come the inevitable threats:\n\nThe \u2018poser\u2019 type Christians are great. Obama loves them because they are useful idiots and pawns to manipulate around the game board to achieve his goals. Netanyahu and other patriots who understand the price of freedom and its preservation will always be hated by Obama.\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting here is the claim that Netanyahu, an Israeli, is somehow a \u201cpatriot.\u201d He may be a patriot to Israel, but he\u2019s no American patriot. I think Roth\u2019s true colors are showing here. Her devotion is not to her own country, but to a foreign country.\n\nAmerican House and Senate, Governors in all 50 states, those running for state and federal elections and you who intend to run for President had better get in your prayer closets and take stock in who you are. What do you really stand for and are you for sale or not? We are taking on the stark face of evil and tyranny whether you want to believe it or not. Wake up America.\n\nOh, we\u2019ve seen the face of tyranny clear enough. It IS for sale (in fact its bought and sold already, by the Kochs) and it\u2019s wrapped in a flag and carrying a cross. In fact, it looks a lot like Dr. Laurie Roth.", "article_metadata": {"description": "What emerges is Netanyahu as some sort of American super patriot for wanting to drag us into the war Republicans can't, because Obama's a bully", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Hrafnkell Haraldsson", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "What emerges is Netanyahu as some sort of American super patriot for wanting to drag us into the war Republicans can't, because Obama's a bully", "title": "Conservative Radio Host: If You Oppose Netanyahu, You Oppose God", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2015/03/22/conservative-radio-host-oppose-netanyahu-oppose-god.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/fightinjesus.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-03-22T14:20:41+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Featured News,Republican Party,america,Barack H.
