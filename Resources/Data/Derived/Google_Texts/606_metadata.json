As explained in this recent post by the good people at NARAL Pro-Choice North Carolina, there is actually cause for optimism that the rules will not unduly burden women\u2019s health. That said, anti-choice advocates are banging the drum to alter the proposed regs in a negative way and, as a result, advocates for women\u2019s health will gather Friday on site in support of keeping the new regulations safe and sane.\n\nThis is from an alert sent out by the good people at Progress NC:\n\nDecember 19: Put Women\u2019s Health First! The NC Department of Health and Human Services has proposed new regulations on abortion providers. The Department has included the input of women\u2019s healthcare providers throughout the rulemaking process, and we need to stay vigilant and make sure that any new regulations put women\u2019s health FIRST. That\u2019s why Planned Parenthood in NC, NARAL Pro-Choice NC, ACLU-NC, NC Women United, NC NOW, NC Women Matter and Progress NC need you to join us on Friday, December 19 at Dorothea Dix Campus, Brown Building, Room 104, 801 Biggs Drive, Raleigh, NC.\n\nClick here for more information.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "That\u2019s why Planned Parenthood in NC, NARAL Pro-Choice NC, ACLU-NC, NC Women United, NC NOW, NC Women Matter and Progress NC need you to join us on Friday, December 19 at Dorothea Dix Campus, Brown Building, Room 104, 801 Biggs Drive, Raleigh, NC.\nThis is from an alert sent out by the good people at Progress NC:December 19: Put Women\u2019s Health First!\nThe state Department of Health and Human Services will be holding a hearing this Friday morning on new proposed abortion provider regulations.\nAs explained in this recent post by the good people at NARAL Pro-Choice North Carolina, there is actually cause for optimism that the rules will not unduly burden women\u2019s health.\nThe NC Department of Health and Human Services has proposed new regulations on abortion providers."}
