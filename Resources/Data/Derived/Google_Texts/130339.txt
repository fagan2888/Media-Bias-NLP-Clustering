Swander Pace Nourishes Vitamin Portfolio with Swanson

The PE firm recently bought Captek Softgel

Middle market private equity firm Swander Pace Capital has bought vitamin retailer Swanson Health Products for an undisclosed amount.

Swanson, headquartered in Fargo, North Dakota, and founded in 1969, sells vitamins and supplements under its own name as well other brands through online and other distributors. The target reaches customers in 51 countries. Swanson founder Lee Swanson announced plans to retire, but will stay on as a consultant. CEO Ken Harris will continue to lead the company.

“The company is extremely well-positioned to take advantage of trends in healthy living, natural and organic lifestyles, and a more active, aging population,” says Swander Pace managing director Corby Reese.

In 2015, Swander Pace made another vitamin deal in soft gelcap maker Captek Softgel International. For on M&A in the vitamins sector, see Supplement Deals Flourish, Even After Investigations. Swander Pace closed a $350 million fund in 2014.
