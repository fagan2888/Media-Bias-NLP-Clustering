Nearly half of dads surveyed proclaimed loyalty to brand-name products vs. about one-third of moms, the study said.\n\nSo it\u2019s Cheerios over generic toasted oats, regardless of the savings. Other favored dad brands include Apple, UnderArmour, Lexus and Lego, the study found.\n\n\u201cI buy mostly name brand,\u201d said one dad in the survey. \u201cI buy almost no generic stuff.\u201d\n\nDiscounts don\u2019t mean nearly as much to dads as moms. A third of dads say they try to buy products on sale vs. 52 percent of moms. Nearly 60 percent of dads eschew coupons, saying they make them look \u201ccheap.\u201d Meanwhile, the majority of moms take pride in getting \u201cgreat value\u201d for their money, while fewer than half of men are likely to brag to their buddies about a huge bargain, the study showed.\n\n\u201cDiscounts are such a point of pride for Mom,\u201d Bruno said. \u201cFor Dad, it\u2019s the opposite \u2014 deals are an insult to his vanity a little bit.\u201d\n\nNot surprisingly, dads spent an average of $250 more on back-to-school shopping than moms last year, the report said.\n\nOne of the biggest shifts in shopping is in the grocery aisle, where 80 percent of millennial dads take primary or shared shopping responsibility. Millennial dads have a more hands-on parenting role overall, with nearly half planning play dates and other outside activities with their kids. Fewer than 1 in 4 older dads are in charge of such activities.\n\n\u201cDads represent a massive untapped market for all sorts of household products and consumer packaged goods \u2014 from diapers to college dorm supplies \u2014 and they are largely overlooked by most brands,\u201d said Sandy Thompson, global planning director at Y&R.\n\nWhile men are more involved in caregiving, disparities persist. Another recent study said women spend 2 to 10 times longer than men caring for a child. One reason is a lack of supportive paternity leave policies, which discourages fathers from being more hands-on with their children. The study, published by MenCare, a global fatherhood campaign, showed women in the U.S. spend 2.7 more hours per day than men on unpaid care work. In Mexico, the gap widens to 4.5 hours.\n\n\u201cWhen fathers take on their fair share of the unpaid care work, it can alter the nature of the relationships between men and women and children, as both fathers and mothers will have more time for their children, women are released from some of their double burden, and fathers get to experience the joys, satisfactions and stresses of caring for their children,\u201d said Nikki van der Gaag, one of the authors of the MenCare report.\n\n\u201cTaking up roles as caregivers also offers men the opportunity to begin to break free from the narrow concepts of manhood and fatherhood, providing their sons and daughters with positive role models, improved health and development, and higher hopes for the future.\u201d\n\nRobert Channick,\n\nChicago Tribune", "article_metadata": {"description": "Discounts don\u2019t mean as much to dads, according to a recent study on the buying habits of the modern North American dad.", "og": {"description": "Discounts don\u2019t mean as much to dads, according to a recent study on the buying habits of the modern North American dad.", "title": "Dads spend more than moms shopping, survey says", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20150620-dads-spend-more-than-moms-shopping-survey-says.ece", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20150620-istock_000050622368_double.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/iStock_000050622368_Double.jpg", "height": 853}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2015-06-20T23:07:14Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2015-06-20T23:07:14Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Dads spend more than moms shopping, survey says\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20150620-dads-spend-more-than-moms-shopping-survey-says.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20150620-istock_000050622368_double.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/iStock_000050622368_Double.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"2341091\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-06-20T23:07:14Z\", \"section\": \"Economy & You Headlines\", \"author\": \"From Wire Reports\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20150620-istock_000050622368_double.jpg.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/iStock_000050622368_Double.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-06-20T23:07:14Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "article_summary": "As dads take a larger role in child-rearing, they are shopping more \u2014 and spending more \u2014 than moms.\nNearly half of dads surveyed proclaimed loyalty to brand-name products vs. about one-third of moms, the study said.\nOne of the biggest shifts in shopping is in the grocery aisle, where 80 percent of millennial dads take primary or shared shopping responsibility.\n\u201cI buy almost no generic stuff.\u201dDiscounts don\u2019t mean nearly as much to dads as moms.\nA third of dads say they try to buy products on sale vs. 52 percent of moms."}
