However, those that do have a stake in the game are young conservatives.\n\nFor the first time ever, more millennials lean to the right, with 35 percent of respondents identifying as conservative and only 33 percent identifying as liberal. Watch out, Washington! It would appear as though the liberal hold among members of America\u2019s largest population is waning.\n\nDespite the desperate attempts to drum up enthusiasm among millennials, by famous progressives, such as Lena Dunham\u2014who starred in a ridiculous viral video with the song \u201cTurn Down for What\u201d blaring in the background\u2014young people just aren\u2019t interested.\n\nYoung people are so jaded and fed up with liberal policies, as this poll underscores. In this Harvard poll, 53 percent of respondents said they disapproved of Obama\u2019s job performance\u2014a drastic change since he assumed office. Millennials are fed up with federal government intrusion in their daily lives. They are increasingly more skeptical of big government.\n\nIn March, Young America\u2019s Foundation released a poll that showed 53 percent of millennials were outraged by NSA data collecting, 50 percent were bothered by the lies surrounding Obamacare, and 46 percent were upset by the IRS targeting of conservative groups. Millennials are concerned with the growing number of issues that have plagued the federal government over the past year. The string of scandals has had a serious impact on young people\u2019s perception of the Obama administration as well as an unfavorable view of big government programs\u2014especially after the botched rollout of Obamacare.\n\nLast week, it was reported that, under Obamacare, health insurance premiums for 23-year-olds have increased 78 percent among men and 45 percent among women. These expensive premiums are far cry from the \u201caffordable\u201d healthcare promises that Obama made to millennials. This Harvard poll shows that 57 percent of millennials disapprove of Obamacare\u2014a drastic jump from two years ago when support for it was at an all time high. It seems Obamacare is to blame for the waning support among young people for the liberal agenda.\n\nThis poll just might be the real \u201cOctober Surprise\u201d\u2014it is very telling of the complete lack of confidence that millennials have in Washington and the policies coming out of it. Millennials bear the financial brunt of these big government policies. Millennials are tired of a nanny-state government constantly telling them it knows what\u2019s best. The ideas of limited government and more individual freedom are resonating among our nation\u2019s young people, proving that conservatives are attractive to this unique demographic.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Last week, the Harvard Institute of Politics released shocking new poll findings regarding millennials..05/26/2016 4:53:04AM EST.", "author": "Ashley Pratte", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Last week, the Harvard Institute of Politics released shocking new poll findings regarding millennials.", "title": "Ashley Pratte - Liberals \u201cTurned Down for What?\u201d\u2014Conservatives", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/ashleypratte/2014/11/03/liberals-turned-down-for-whatconservatives-n1913588", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2014/11/3/3.png", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Last week, the Harvard Institute of Politics released shocking new poll findings regarding millennials.", "title": "Ashley Pratte - Liberals \u201cTurned Down for What?\u201d\u2014Conservatives", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/ashleypratte/2014/11/03/liberals-turned-down-for-whatconservatives-n1913588", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2014/11/3/3.png", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Liberals \u201cTurned Down for What?\u201d\u2014Conservatives, Ashley Pratte, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb595\"", "article_summary": "In this Harvard poll, 53 percent of respondents said they disapproved of Obama\u2019s job performance\u2014a drastic change since he assumed office.\nYoung people are so jaded and fed up with liberal policies, as this poll underscores.\nLast week, the Harvard Institute of Politics released shocking new poll findings regarding millennials.\nThis Harvard poll shows that 57 percent of millennials disapprove of Obamacare\u2014a drastic jump from two years ago when support for it was at an all time high.\nIt seems Obamacare is to blame for the waning support among young people for the liberal agenda."}
