The teens said 30 seconds of quick thinking is what kept them alive.\n\nAuthorities say two 18-year-olds from Jenks, one who says he is a certified pilot, took off in a Cessna 172 from Riverside Airport. They were doing a touch-and-go at TIA with the next stop at an Owasso airport.\n\nThe call went out as a plane crash, but there wasn't a scratch on the Cessna, or the two teenagers inside. Firefighters said the 18 year olds pulled off a perfect emergency landing.\n\nThe 18 year olds said the small engine plane barely made it past the runway when the plane's vertical speed indicator - that shows how fast the plane is climbing - hit zero.\n\nPilot Eric Nichols had just finished his first day back at Jenks High School when he and pilot-in-training Tanner Price took off from Riverside Airport.\n\n\"It's amazing. I've never seen something like this before. Never been in it,\u201d Price said.\n\nThey flew to Tulsa International, touched ground then took off again, but at about 100 feet in the air the plane stopped climbing because the engine lost power.\n\n\"We had about 1,900 RPMs and I knew that wasn't going to be enough to get us anywhere, so we didn't have enough runway, I told tower, 'I'm putting it down,' and I set it down on the road here,\u201d Nichols said.\n\n\"From the time that it actually happened and the time that we were stopped was maybe 30 seconds,\u201d said Price.\n\nNichols was able to put down the plane between two utility poles and had to avoid a car driving down the street. He said he has made landings on narrow strips before, but as he was descending, a car was driving down the street, which slowed to avoid the plane.\n\n\"Uh, it was a tight fit. Definitely a tight fit,\u201d Nichols said.\n\nTulsa Fire Airport Chief, Michael Atchison, said he was impressed.\n\n\"Real proud of those guys,\u201d Atchison said. \u201cThey did a good job 'cause, you know, the tense moments right there, for them to lay it down, find a place to land it when they lost all the power. They did a great job.\"\n\nOur own pilot, Will Kavanagh, was also impressed.\n\n\"Very tight landing. For such young pilots to have this experience so young, and to walk away from this, only good things for them in the future,\u201d Kavanagh said.\n\nThe pilot said he has 61 hours of in-plane training while his co-pilot has 13.\n\nThe two were almost calm when we talked to them and they credited their training for how they handled the emergency.\n\nThe plane is owned by Tulsa-based Christensen Aviation, the company run by former city councilor Bill Christensen. Someone at the company confirmed that no one was injured but made no other comment.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "A plane lost its power over Tulsa and two teenagers landed it without a scratch.", "author": "NewsOn6.com , Allison Harris", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/26319363/plane-lands-in-apache-street-near-tia", "image": "http://KOTV.images.worldnow.com/images/4521481_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A plane lost its power over Tulsa and two teenagers landed it without a scratch.", "title": "Plane Lands In Street Near Tulsa International Airport"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KOTV.images.worldnow.com/images/4521481_G.jpg", "description": "A plane lost its power over Tulsa and two teenagers landed it without a scratch.", "card": "summary", "title": "Plane Lands In Street Near Tulsa International Airport"}, "wnreadableurl": "plane-lands-in-apache-street-near-tia", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KOTV", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "date": "2014/08/19", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,newsok,channel 9,channel nine,news 9,television,this morning,live radar,kwtv,sports,video,live streaming,interactive", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS06", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,newsok,channel 9,channel nine,news 9,television,this morning,live radar,kwtv,sports,video,live streaming,interactive"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1c9e\"", "article_summary": "A plane lost its power over Tulsa and two teenagers landed it without a scratch.\nAuthorities say two 18-year-olds from Jenks, one who says he is a certified pilot, took off in a Cessna 172 from Riverside Airport.\nPilot Eric Nichols had just finished his first day back at Jenks High School when he and pilot-in-training Tanner Price took off from Riverside Airport.\nThe call went out as a plane crash, but there wasn't a scratch on the Cessna, or the two teenagers inside.\nThe plane is owned by Tulsa-based Christensen Aviation, the company run by former city councilor Bill Christensen."}
