Kennedy.\n\nOn same-sex marriage and the courts, the stimulus and the economy, Iraq and foreign policy, Biden has been an integral but occasionally overlooked force throughout his career, particularly in the White House.\n\n------------\n\nFOR THE RECORD\n\nBiden legacy: In the July 12 Section A, an article about Vice President Joe Biden incorrectly described an aspect of the debate over Robert Bork\u2019s nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1987. The article described Bork\u2019s nomination as posing a \u201cthreat\u201d to civil rights and abortion rights. The article should have made clear that this was the view of those opposed to Bork\u2019s confirmation.\n\n------------\n\nNow, in what may be the closing chapter of his career, Biden\u2019s close circle of friends and former aides see the political landscape shifting toward him. And with an open presidential election looming, some wonder why he should surrender the spotlight.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the only person that would be in the race that\u2019s spent the last eight years helping make decisions from gay marriage to Obamacare to Iraq and Afghanistan, and understands how difficult\u201d it is, said Dick Harpootlian, former South Carolina Democratic Party chairman and one of the most vocal proponents of a third Biden presidential bid. \u201cThis is the perfect environment for him.\u201d\n\nHe's the only person that would be in the race that's spent the last eight years helping make decisions from gay marriage to Obamacare to Iraq and Afghanistan. \u2014 Dick Harpootlian, former South Carolina Democratic Party chairman, on a possible 2016 presidential run by Vice President Joe Biden\n\nWhether Biden will embark on one last run for the presidency is one of the remaining major questions of the opening stage of the 2016 campaign. The May 30 death of Biden\u2019s eldest son, Beau, has largely put the question on hold for Biden himself. His focus in recent weeks has been on his family, as was evident as he and his wife doted on their grandchildren during a trip to Vancouver this weekend for the women\u2019s World Cup final. A decision on whether to make a run is expected by September, though that timetable has already slid.\n\nThe presence of an incumbent vice president who is not his party\u2019s expected nominee is an anomaly in most recent U.S. presidential elections. Yet those who might question why Biden would take on Hillary Rodham Clinton, widely seen as the heavy favorite in the Democratic contest, only need be reminded that he ran against her in 2008 under a similar circumstance. And as Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders continues to show that some Democrats are open to a Clinton alternative, Biden might see a path to combine Sanders\u2019 populist zeal with his own more establishment-friendly heft.\n\nOn a number of issues that are likely to come to the forefront on the campaign trail, a close examination shows Biden had a significant role in shaping policy. The Supreme Court\u2019s historic ruling was one example.\n\nAs the senator overseeing Bork\u2019s confirmation hearing in 1987, Biden opted against an approach favored by many in the civil rights community: to focus on the threat Bork posed both to civil rights and to abortion rights. Instead, he opted for an examination of the nominee\u2019s views on the right to privacy and the broader question of whether to recognize so-called unenumerated rights -- those not specified in the Constitution but upheld in court decisions.\n\n\u201cThe fundamental rights notion \u2026 is the doctrinal basis for protecting gays and lesbians under the Constitution. That\u2019s why what Biden did that summer was so important,\u201d said Mark Gitenstein, Biden\u2019s chief counsel at the Judiciary Committee at the time and the aide who sent him the recent text. \u201cWhat he did that summer was not only intellectually understand it. He articulated it in a way that average Americans could understand it and embrace it, too.\u201d\n\nDefeating President Reagan\u2019s nomination of Bork ultimately brought about the confirmation of Kennedy, arguably the LGBT rights movement\u2019s main judicial ally as the swing vote on the Supreme Court and the writer of the majority opinion legalizing same-sex marriage. Gitenstein also argues that Biden helped change the way Supreme Court nominees are considered, requiring them to address the question of fundamental rights that would \u201cshape jurisprudence on the Supreme Court for 30 years.\u201d\n\nDecades later, Biden had a more direct contribution to the same-sex marriage effort. In a 2012 television appearance, he plainly answered \u201cyes\u201d to the question of whether he supported the right of gays to marry, before President Obama had done so.\n\nBiden\u2019s affirmation, followed by the president\u2019s, \u201cneeds to be seen as one important powerful moment that absolutely gave permission to millions of Americans to rethink their decision and move in support of freedom to marry,\u201d said Evan Wolfson, himself a former Biden intern and founder and president of Freedom to Marry, a group Biden will speak to Thursday night at an event celebrating the court ruling.\n\nBiden\u2019s contributions to the fight for marriage equality grew out of the causes he championed in his earliest days in politics, which he has said were inspired by the civil rights movement of the 1960s.\n\n\u201cWhen you see him at his most passionate, it\u2019s usually when he\u2019s addressing a situation where an institution or a person or a situation gives a more powerful person the ability to defeat the less powerful person,\u201d said Ted Kaufman, a longtime Biden confidant who briefly replaced him in the Senate when he became vice president. Kaufman cited the Violence Against Women Act of 1994, which Biden wrote, as a prime example.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Biden's quiet role in same-sex marriage ruling fuels speculation about 2016 run", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "After the Supreme Court handed down a landmark decision last month sanctioning same-sex marriage in all 50 states, a longtime friend and former staffer to Vice President Joe Biden sent a text message to congratulate him: \u201cYour legacy. 28 years ago,\u201d the aide wrote.", "title": "Biden's quiet role in same-sex marriage ruling fuels speculation about 2016 run", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-biden-campaign-question-20150709-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-559dd437/turbine/la-na-biden-campaign-question-20150709", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp15.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "Vice President Joe Biden, 2016 election, same-sex marriage", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/83955663", "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2015-07-09", "Description": "After the Supreme Court handed down a landmark decision last month sanctioning same-sex marriage in all 50 states, a longtime friend and former staffer to Vice President Joe Biden sent a text message to congratulate him: \u201cYour legacy. 28 years ago,\u201d the aide wrote.
