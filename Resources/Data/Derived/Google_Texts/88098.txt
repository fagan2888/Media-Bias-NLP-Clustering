Democratic National Committee chairwoman and Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz is “pissed off” according to a fundraising email the DNC sent out under her name over Labor Day weekend.

With a subject line reading, “This pisses me off,” Wasserman Schultz claims Republicans “don’t get their way” on issues such as repealing Obamacare or defunding Planned Parenthood, “they’re just fine with shutting down the government — again!”

Writing “Republicans in Congress are dead-set on rolling back the progress that Democrats like you and I have worked so hard to achieve,” Wasserman Schultz defends Planned Parenthood, the group recently exposed for the selling of organs from aborted babies, saying Republicans “want to completely defund Planned Parenthood, an organization that provides necessary health services to women across the country.”

In spite of the fact that Planned Parenthood does not perform any mammograms, Wasserman Schultz uses her survival of breast cancer to attack Republicans. “I’m going to be frank: That pisses me off. As a woman, a mother, and a cancer survivor, I say that we can’t stand for this kind of irresponsible behavior — and it’s exactly what we’ll see more of if Republicans retain their majority in 2016.”

After venting her anger toward Republicans, Wasserman Schultz asks for money. “If you’re with me, chip in $3 right now to help elect more Democrats,” the email reads and offers links for the recipient to click to give a donation.

During her tenure as leader of the DNC, Wasserman Schultz has overseen Democratic Party losses that gave the GOP their largest majority since 1928 and saw the Senate flip to Republican control in 2014.
