She was so nice, so he yelled at us,\u201d he wrote.\n\n(Photo: Instagram)\n\nThe passerby went on to add the former couple\u2019s scooter jaunt held up traffic and claimed the teen idol \u201cruined\u201d his celebrity-voyeur moment by being \u201crude\u201d to him. It\u2019s worth noting no-one has heard Justin\u2019s side of that alleged exchange. It\u2019s possible he was provoked, and maybe not.\n\nRewinding the ballad of Bieber and Gomez, he posted a memorably steamy Instagram of himself and the \u201cCome and Get Me\u201d starlet during her April visit to see him in Europe while he performed Believe tour dates.\n\nAt the time it sparked reunion rumors, more Instagrams and more sightings. But it all seemed to fizzle out as the year wore on.\n\nPerhaps it\u2019s different this time.\n\nBieber has just spent three months releasing a run of 10 songs in his Music Mondays series ahead of the release of his latest Journals album. So far, he has revealed at least two of the songs in the set \u2014 \u201cHeartbreaker\u201d and \u201cAll That Matters\u201d \u2014 are about the Latina.\n\nHas his very public musical declaration of affection finally thawed the recent radio silence between the pair now that the actress-singer is back in California?\n\nImage via Twitter\n\nGomez recently canceled the Australian and Asia legs of her Stars Dance World Tour, citing a need to focus on herself amid reports she suffers from the auto-immune disease Lupus.\n\nIn addition to Journals, in a December interview with Los Angeles\u2019 Power 106 radio station, Bieber openly admitted he still loved his ex-girlfriend.\n\n\u201cIt affected us, especially when we are in front of so many people,\u201d he told the host Big Boy while describing one of their breakups. \u201cIt\u2019s such a public thing. It\u2019s just hard for the both of us. But you know, she\u2019s a great woman. I love her till this day. I think we\u2019re going to be the greatest of friends.\u201d\n\nAt the time, Justin added, \u201cRight now we\u2019re taking a little time and not talking.\u201d\n\nLooks like they\u2019re talking just fine now.\n\nWonder how long it will be before critical and highly dubious sources have their say?", "article_metadata": {"description": "If Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez aren't telling the world they have reunited, we're not sure we know what color the sky is.
