Well, I will admit that some may feel that way, and I certainly don't know whether or not he is the worst president ever, but I believe he will be judged as one of the worst for the following reasons:\n\nHis foreign policies have created a terrible mess in the Middle East, and he hasn't improved relations with our allies while supporting those countries that oppose us like Iran. His economic policies and increased regulations have hurt businesses and haven't helped the middle class one bit.\n\nWhile he promised us transparency, he has done virtually everything important in secrecy. Instead of trying to improve race relations, he has used race and class warfare to his advantage. He has failed to support law enforcement and has failed to enforce the laws he doesn't like such as deportation. He has lied to us repeatedly on the benefits of the Affordable Care Act, the Benghazi tragedy, and the IRS scandal.\n\nI don't know what his intentions were, but his efforts to \u201ctransform America\u201d haven't made this a better country. Finally, I do not think he had the ability to manage anything \u2014 much less handle one of the toughest jobs in the world \u2014 but his selection of advisers was terrible. Too many cronies and not enough qualified people. So, the end result has been very disappointing.\n\n\u2014 Dan Schuchardt, Glen Ellyn", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Obama may not be the worst president \u2014 but he's a disappointment", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune", "author": "Chicago Tribune", "og": {"site_name": "chicagotribune.com", "description": "In his Tuesday column , Ron Grossman suggested that the primary reason many people claim that Barack Obama is the worst president ever is simply because he is black.
