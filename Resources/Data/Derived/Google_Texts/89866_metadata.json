Most recently, for instance, the state Department of Motor Vehicles shut down for a week in August to upgrade its computer systems. That effort was intended to modernize how state residents interact with the agency.\n\nThe DMV also launched a mobile app just over a year ago, in September 2014, that lets users take practice tests in English and Spanish, among other features. DMV officials said in September that the app was downloaded more than 115,000 times in its first year.\n\nThe ITIF report maintains that, while individual states have made some advances, none has embraced its full IT-related, money saving potential.\n\n\u201cImagine a leaner state government that needs fewer workers and materials to get the same or better results,\u201d said Atkinson. \u201cBy fully integrating technology into agency operations, governments can cut the time citizens waste standing in line or filling out forms, reduce the burden on taxpayers, and make everyday services more efficient and effective. This not only cuts costs, but also makes everyone more productive \u2014 which is essential for state economic growth.\u201d\n\nChristine Stuart contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"publisher": "CT News Junkie", "og": {"url": "http://www.ctnewsjunkie.com/archives/entry/will_technology_upgrades_save_connecticut_money_or_is_it_a_false_promise/", "site_name": "CT News Junkie", "type": "article", "description": "Connecticut could save $248 million over a five-year span if officials consider eliminating the jobs of some state workers through the use of better technology, according to a think tank report out this week.", "title": "Will Technology Upgrades Save Connecticut Money Or Is It A False Promise? | CT News Junkie"}, "robots": "index,follow,archive", "fb": {"admins": 100000516708778, "app_id": 625264840857145}, "google-site-verification": "xSWCEDPXS2srINlbzkJoWA5QowbCkai3awnZqgts9xc", "viewport": "width=1474"}, "article_summary": "All states could boost their productivity, and save money, by better harnessing information technology resources, according to the Information Technology and Innovation Fund (ITIF), a Washington-based nonprofit and nonpartisan think tank.\nThe ITIF report maintains that, while individual states have made some advances, none has embraced its full IT-related, money saving potential.\n\u201cBut to achieve this promise of e-government, leaders will need to clearly articulate the goal of replacing labor with technology,\u201d he said.\n\u201cImagine a leaner state government that needs fewer workers and materials to get the same or better results,\u201d said Atkinson.\nBut Donald Cohen, executive director of In The Public Interest, a Washington-based research and policy center, warned of the false promises of potential technology savings."}
