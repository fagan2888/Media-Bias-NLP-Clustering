The undeniable truth is global warming alarmists raise and spend far more money \u2013 including far more untraceable special interest \u201cdark money\u201d \u2013 than global warming skeptics.\n\nDrexel University sociologist Robert Brulle published a paper last week in the journal Climatic Change identifying 91 conservative and libertarian think tanks that Brulle claims play an influential role opposing global warming programs. Brulle claims the 91 groups receive approximately $900 million in cumulative funding each year, with approximately $64 million coming from foundations that distribute \u201cdark money\u201d that cannot be traced to a particular donor. Brulle claims the $900 million in funding \u2013 and especially the $64 million in dark money \u2013 tilts the playing field and gives global warming skeptics undue political and public relations influence.\n\nGlobal warming alarmists and their media allies present Brulle\u2019s paper as \u201cproof\u201d that money drives the global warming debate and the money is heavily skewed in favor of skeptics. For example, UK Guardian environmental reporter Suzanne Goldenberg published an article last week titled \u201cConservative groups have spent $1bn a year on the effort to deny science and oppose action on climate change.\u201d Scientific American published a similar article titled \u201c\u2019Dark Money\u2019 Funds Climate Change Denial Effort.\u201d Liberal pundit and former MSNBC anchor Cenk Uygur posted a 10-minute Internetvideo discussing Brulle\u2019s paper and playing up its findings.\n\nBrulle\u2019s paper and the media narrative may score some temporary points with members of the general public who do not closely follow the global warming debate, but ultimately Brulle\u2019s paper and the media narrative will backfire on global warming activists. The narrative will backfire because the general public is not stupid. Slick lies may win some converts who will not check the facts, but the greater number of people will check the facts and hold the liars accountable.\n\nAs an initial matter, despite what Suzanne Goldenberg and the UK Guardian claim, it is palpably untrue that \u201cConservative groups have spent $1 bn a year on the effort to deny science and oppose action on climate change.\u201d Without even addressing the mathematical fact that $900 million is $100 million short of the $1 billion claimed by Goldenberg, Brulle\u2019s paper merely tabulates the total money raised by the 91 conservative think tanks for their total operations regarding all issues they address and does not break down how much of each think tank\u2019s resources are devoted to issues such as economic policy, health care policy, foreign policy, climate policy, etc. Goldenberg tells the lie that all money raised by all conservative and libertarian think tanks is devoted to global warming skepticism. Tell that to the supporters of Obamacare.\n\nA look at some conservative think tank websites illustrates the point. While writing this article on New Year\u2019s Day, I pulled up the website for the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), which Brulle and the media claim is the conservative think tank receiving and spending the most money on global warming skepticism. AEI has 15 articles featured on the front page of its website, and not a single one focuses on global warming.\n\nI also pulled up the website for the Heritage Foundation, which Brulle and the media claim is the conservative think tank receiving and spending the second most amount of money on global warming skepticism. The Heritage Foundation has 10 articles featured on the front page of its website. None of the 10 focuses on global warming. Merely 2 of the 10 focus on any aspect of energy or environment policy.\n\nBetween AEI and Heritage \u2013 representing fully 30 percent of the money raised by the 91 conservative think tanks \u2013 the global warming issue comprises substantially less than 10 percent of their cumulative time, money and efforts. Even if we generously assign to the global warming issue a full 10 percent of the money raised by the 91 foremost conservative think tanks, this means the 91 conservative think tanks are devoting a mere $90 million per year \u2013 rather than the asserted $900 million per year (or Goldenberg\u2019s exaggerated $1 billion per year) \u2013 to the global warming debate.\n\nAnd it is not just AEI and Heritage that devote little attention to the global warming issue. The Hoover Institution, identified as raising and spending the third most money on global warming skepticism, also rarely addresses the global warming topic. The most recent Hoover Institution item I can find addressing the topic is a short op-ed published more than two months ago in National Review Online by a Hoover Institution fellow commenting on a global warming poll. Prior to that short op-ed, the most recent Hoover Institution item I can find is an article published nine months ago supporting a carbon tax.\n\nThis brings us to another whopper told by Brulle, Goldenberg and their media allies \u2013 the assertion that all the think tanks identified in Brulle\u2019s paper actively fight against global warming activism. To the contrary, two of the three top-funded groups (AEI and the Hoover Institution) support a carbon tax. Other groups identified in Brulle\u2019s paper have similarly expressed support for a carbon tax and global warming activism. At least 25 percent of the funding that Brulle claims goes to skeptical think tanks actually goes to think tanks supporting global warming restrictions.\n\nAll told, giving the global warming activists every benefit of the doubt, no more than $90 million of conservative think tank money addresses global warming, and no more than $68 million supports conservative think tank efforts opposing global warming activism. This $68 million is counterbalanced by $22 million for conservative think tank efforts supporting global warming activism. That leaves a net of merely $46 million among 91 conservative think tanks opposing global warming activism.\n\nEven though $46 million is far short of the $1 billion claimed by Goldenberg, $46 million may still seem like a large amount of money. It is only a drop in the bucket, however, compared to the money raised and spent by groups supporting global warming activism.\n\nTwo environmental activist groups \u2013 Greenpeace and The Nature Conservancy \u2013 raise more than $1 billion cumulatively per year. These two groups raise more money than the combined funding of the 91 conservative think tanks identified in Brulle\u2019s paper. Just as importantly, these two groups raise money solely for environmental causes and frequently advocate for global warming restrictions. Their $1 billion is not diluted addressing issues such as economic policy, health care policy, foreign policy, etc.\n\nFive environment-specific groups alone raise more than $1.6 billion per year (Greenpeace, The Nature Conservancy, World Wildlife Fund, National Wildlife Federation, and the Sierra Club). All five focus solely on environmental issues and are frequent and prominent advocates for global warming restrictions. When global warming activists claim global warming skeptics receive the lion\u2019s share of funding in the global warming debate, they are lying through their teeth.\n\nInterestingly, Brulle and his media allies place special emphasis on the so-called dark money given to conservative think tanks by foundations with anonymous donors. Only $64 million of the conservative think tanks\u2019 $900 million in total donations come from foundations. At most, only $6.4 million of the \u201cdark money\u201d addresses global warming topics, with a net of only $3.2 million opposing global warming activism. Nevertheless, the assertion is dark money is nefarious money and has a special impact on the debate. As Cenk Uyger claimed in his video post:\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s over 140 different foundations \u2026 As you\u2019re about to find out here, they\u2019re totally funded by the groups that have a financial interest in making sure that you don\u2019t believe in climate change. So those 140 different foundations are shell groups \u2013 they\u2019re set up ironically by companies like Shell \u2013 to make sure that you believe something that\u2019s going to help their bottom line that isn\u2019t true.\u201d\n\nCuriously, neither Brulle nor Uyger provides any evidence or source material backing up the assertion that most money donated to conservative foundations is donated by energy companies with an agenda to fund global warming skeptics. They simply make the assertion based on speculation without providing any factual support. However, it is difficult to believe that most conservative foundation money is donated by energy companies with an anti-global warming agenda, especially when the conservative foundations give a large portion of the money to think tanks that support carbon taxes and think tanks that devote little attention the global warming issue.\n\nPutting this minimal conservative dark money in context, liberal foundations with anonymous donors are major funders of global warming activist groups. For example, check out the list of Defenders of Wildlife\u2019s \u201cSelect Funders\u201d here. Heck, Al Gore\u2019s Climate Reality Project sent out a fundraising letter last week telling people that an \u201canonymous donor\u201d would match every other donation dollar-for-dollar. Somehow, neither Brulle nor the media remembered to mention these inconvenient truths in their narrative.\n\nOh, and seeing that Uyger brought it up \u2013 Shell is alongtime supporter of carbon dioxide restrictions and has a history of funding global warming activist groups.\n\nThe long and short of it is think tanks and activist groups supporting global warming restrictions raise and spend far more money than think tanks and activist groups opposing global warming restrictions. Global warming activists may think they are scoring short-term political points by lying and misleading the public about such funding, but their lies will certainly come back to haunt them. They always do.\n\n[Originally published on Forbes]", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://blog.heartland.org/2014/01/dark-money-funds-to-promote-global-warming-alarmism-dwarf-warming-denier-research/", "type": "activity", "image": "http://blog.heartland.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/iceberg_true1.jpg", "site_name": "Somewhat Reasonable", "title": "\u2018Dark Money\u2019 Funds To Promote Global Warming Alarmism Dwarf Warming \u2018Denier\u2019 Research"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0907\"", "article_summary": "When global warming activists claim global warming skeptics receive the lion\u2019s share of funding in the global warming debate, they are lying through their teeth.\nGlobal warming activists claim vast amounts of untraceable special interest money fund global warming skeptics and give skeptics an unfair advantage in the global warming debate.\nThe undeniable truth is global warming alarmists raise and spend far more money \u2013 including far more untraceable special interest \u201cdark money\u201d \u2013 than global warming skeptics.\nThe Hoover Institution, identified as raising and spending the third most money on global warming skepticism, also rarely addresses the global warming topic.\nAt most, only $6.4 million of the \u201cdark money\u201d addresses global warming topics, with a net of only $3.2 million opposing global warming activism."}
