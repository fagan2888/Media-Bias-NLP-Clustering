At Tuesday\u2019s house party in DeSoto, 15 Dallas-area moms shared with Biden their personal stories about the importance of healthcare coverage. The house party campaign is the latest phase in MomsRising\u2019s ongoing Wellness Wonder Teams campaign.\n\nThe vice president\u2019s wife shared a story about a good friend in New Jersey who\u2019s dealing with cancer. Her insurance company dropped her in the middle of treatment, but she signed up with the ACA\u2019s insurance exchanges and received coverage.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big deal about the preexisting condition because, you know, my friend, your friend, would never have been able to get insurance,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI think we probably all know somebody who this has happened to. I push my students to sign up.\n\n\u201cThey need to realize, accidents happen,\u201d Biden said, holding up her cast-encased left hand, which broke in a fall in late January.\n\nWhile the event and initiative are focused on women, Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins\u2014a staunch supporter of the law and its efforts\u2014was also in attendance.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re finding healthcare decisions in family units are made by women,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople listen more to women. So empowering other women to talk to people they love should really help.\u201d\n\nMomsRising provides tool kits that include information on coverage options and enrollment. Open enrollment for healthcare through the marketplaces for this year closes on March 31. About 1 in 4 people in Texas\u2014or 6.4 million residents\u2014is uninsured, and the number is even higher in Dallas.\n\nVeronica Moore, regional outreach specialist with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said 506,000 Dallas County residents are eligible for some type of financial assistance for their coverage.\n\n\u201cWhen people think about the ACA they think this is another government program, and I have to be really low-income to qualify, that\u2019s just not the case,\u201d Moore said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a case where a family of four that makes up to $90,000 a year and can still get some kind of financial assistance.\u201d\n\nParties can be hosted at homes, community centers, schools, or anywhere, MomsRising officials emphasized. The group provides a \u201cHealthcare Gathering Toolkit\u201d pamphlet, which includes info on how to plan a gathering, a sample agenda, sample questions and activities, a flowchart with coverage options, and information about women\u2019s preventative services in the ACA.\n\nWhite House pool reports were used in this story.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "D Healthcare Daily", "description": "Second Lady of the United States Jill Biden.
