New York Cityâ€™s La Guardia Airport was closed Thursday after a Delta Air Lines jet skidded off the runway amid snowy weather.

There was snow on the ground at the airport, where airlines had earlier canceled hundreds of flights that were scheduled to depart Thursday. Authorities said all passengers and crew members were safely taken off the plane. Delta said customers exited the aircraft via slides and were moved to the terminal on buses.

New York Giants tight end Larry Donnell, who was on the flight, and other passengers shared videos and photos of the incident.
