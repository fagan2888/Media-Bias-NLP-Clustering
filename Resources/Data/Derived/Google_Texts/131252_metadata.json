All of the major energy agencies are predicting a major increase in global energy consumption in coming decades, so we have to work to ensure that this doesn\u2019t result in a commensurate increase in global emissions. The way to do this is to lower the carbon intensity of the energy sources we do use.\n\nIt is possible in theory to allow energy consumption to increase while reducing the impacts of that energy consumption. In practice, the world has yet to achieve that, but local successes can be instructive. In the U.S., energy demand has declined in response to much higher prices. Governments can use price as a tool, but in order to be accepted there would need to be an offsetting reduction in other taxes if taxes on energy were increased.\n\nFurther, we need to displace the more carbon-intensive energy options, which we have been doing in the U.S. with respect to our coal consumption. The increasing role of natural gas and renewables have both contributed to the U.S. taking the global lead in recent years in reducing carbon emissions. Continued development of low-carbon energy options that can compete with coal will enable the developing world to continue development without the pollution that might otherwise be caused by a massive increase in energy consumption.\n\nRobert Rapier (@RRapier) is chief technology officer and executive vice president at Merica International, a forestry and renewable energy company.
