Meanwhile, Sanders seeks to replace the law with a government-run Medicare-for-all program.\n\nClinton, who on Monday led Sanders in the polls 48 percent to 44 percent, said reigniting a debate over the ACA would be wrenching for the country.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t repeal it and we can\u2019t start over,\u201d Clinton said Saturday, according to the New York Times.\n\nSanders attacked Clinton Jan. 21, saying she is lacking details of her plans to improve the ACA.\n\n\u201cHow exactly would Secretary Clinton, as she vaguely put it, \u2018get us the rest of the way?\u2019 She hasn\u2019t told us,\u201d his campaign said. \u201cHer website promises she\u2019ll \u2018expand affordable coverage, slow the growth of overall healthcare costs and make it possible for providers to deliver the very best care to patients.\u2019 How exactly? Does she have a plan to improve Medicare or Medicaid? Does she have a plan to provide insurance for 29 million Americans who still lack coverage and more who are underinsured?\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley, who\u2019s locked up a paltry 4 percent in the latest Iowa polls unveiled a health plan in late November that would build on the Affordable Care Act and attempt to reduce prescription drug costs, among others things.\n\n\"The next president must build on the (ACA\u2019s) success, while continuing to reduce costs, expand access, and improve the quality of care,\" the plan said.\n\nO\u2019Malley would prohibit price gouging for prescription drug costs and use the government's purchasing power to ensure more reasonable prices for drugs.\n\nBut while Democrats are pitching reforms to the ACA, the Republican field is more apt to replace it.\n\n\u201cThis law is a disaster,\u201d Sen. Ted Cruz recently said on Fox News. \u201cPeople are hurting.\u201d\n\nFox Host Chris Wallace has said the Cruz plan to replace the ACA by selling insurance across state lines, expanding health savings accounts and making insurance portable between jobs, \u201cwould have almost no effect in giving people who are not uninsured health coverage.\u201d\n\nBut Cruz, who on Monday was closing in on frontrunner Donald Trump, shot back that the analysis of organizations like the Congressional Budget Office about his plan were \u201csimply not accurate.\u201d\n\nTrump was leading Cruz in the latest Iowa polls on Monday, 29 percent to 24 percent.\n\nTrump has said he would dismantle the ACA, but has not given any specific plans.\n\n\"We're going to work with our hospitals,\" Trump said on Jan. 10 to ABC. \"We're going to work with our doctors. We've got to do something. ... We'll work something out. That doesn't mean single-payer.\"\n\n[Like Healthcare IT News on Facebook]\n\nFlorida Sen. Marco Rubio, currently in third place in Iowa polls with 17 percent of likely voters, proposed on his website \u201ccommon sense, free-market ideas to make healthcare more accessible and affordable.\u201d That means repealing and replacing the ACA, allowing individuals to control their own healthcare choices and returning control of health policy to the states, he has said.\n\nJeb Bush\u2019s plan to repeal the ACA would limit federal payments to states and create a transition for the 17 million people receiving insurance coverage under the law. Bush would also limit tax-free status of employer-provided health insurance, empower states to design Medicaid programs and increase funding for the National Institutes of Health.\n\nMeanwhile, Ben Carson, would focus on tax-protected \u201chealth empowerment accounts\u201d and high-deductible health insurance plans. Carson's plan also called for overhauling Medicaid by giving users private insurance options funded through state-run Medicaid programs.\n\nOnly Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who on Monday showed 3 percent of voters backing him in the polls, would keep some portions of the ACA. In fact, he worked to secure a $13 billion Medicaid expansion to cover more people in his state.\n\nTwitter: @HealthITNews", "article_metadata": {"description": "While the Republican candidates mostly spar over how they will repeal Obamacare, Democrats say they would build on the existing reform.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Healthcare IT News", "description": "While the Republican candidates mostly spar over how they will repeal Obamacare, Democrats say they would build on the existing reform.", "title": "Trump, Cruz, Clinton, Sanders differ on healthcare as Iowa caucus begins", "url": "http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/trump-cruz-clinton-sanders-differ-healthcare-iowa-caucus-begins", "image": "http://www.healthcareitnews.com/sites/default/files/trumphitn.png", "updated_time": "2016-02-01T14:15:47-05:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/trump-cruz-clinton-sanders-differ-healthcare-iowa-caucus-begins", "image": {"src": "http://www.healthcareitnews.com/sites/default/files/trumphitn.png"}, "description": "While the Republican candidates mostly spar over how they will repeal Obamacare, Democrats say they would build on the existing reform.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Trump, Cruz, Clinton, Sanders differ on healthcare as Iowa caucus begins"}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-01T14:11:03-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-01T14:15:47-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "In the Democratic race, Hillary Clinton is supporting the Affordable Care Act, saying she will reform certain provisions to improve it.\nMeanwhile, Ben Carson, would focus on tax-protected \u201chealth empowerment accounts\u201d and high-deductible health insurance plans.\nAs the Iowa caucus kicked off on Monday, candidates on both sides sparred over their plans for healthcare and the future of President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act in general.\nBush would also limit tax-free status of employer-provided health insurance, empower states to design Medicaid programs and increase funding for the National Institutes of Health.\nSanders attacked Clinton Jan. 21, saying she is lacking details of her plans to improve the ACA."}
