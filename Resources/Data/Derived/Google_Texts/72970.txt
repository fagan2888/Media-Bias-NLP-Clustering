Some 100,000 state employees and retirees are being asked to prove they are not living in sin, or risk losing their health insurance.

Even those married for decades have until April 15 to submit proof of their legal union, such as a marriage license, plus tax returns or other financial documents.

The audit of the state Health Insurance Program has caused a run on the City Clerk’s Office, where marriage licenses dating back to 1930 are available.

The state says it wants to weed out cheaters. It offered an amnesty period for anyone claiming an ineligible dependent, including children who were too old, and found 5,635 people getting health insurance who were ineligible.

“Sparing taxpayers and enrollees the cost of paying for ineligible claims is expected to save the state more than $10 million,” said Edward Walsh, a spokesman for the Civil Service Department.

He said the state would work with enrollees “who may have special challenges in providing the necessary documentation.”

Another 200,000 health-plan participants will have to submit documentation in coming months.
