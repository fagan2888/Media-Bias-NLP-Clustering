In the event that the U.S. economy crashed, Trump has floated a recovery plan based on his own experience with corporate bankruptcy: Pay Americas creditors less than full value on the U.S. Treasurys they hold. Experts see it as a reckless idea that would send interest rates soaring, slow economic growth and undermine confidence in the worlds most trusted financial asset. (Photo: Charles Krupa / AP)\n\nDonald Trump became the presumptive Republican presidential nominee this week, casting a more serious light on the policy proposals he has put forth during the GOP contest.\n\nHere\u2019s a quick look at how some of Trump\u2019s economic ideas could broadly affect your finances should he prevail with both voters and Congress, keeping in mind that his plans are likely to evolve as he prepares further policy speeches and chooses his running mate:\n\n\u25a0Your purchasing power: The hefty tariffs on imports Trump has proposed include many goods we take for granted and don\u2019t have the capacity to produce within our own borders, said Mark Hamrick, Washington bureau chief and senior economic analyst at Bankrate.com.\n\n\u201cCertainly, agricultural sources in Mexico, they either become more expensive or unavailable,\u201d Hamrick said. \u201cGood luck eating dandelion greens for four months of the year.\u201d\n\nThe threat of a 35 percent tax on auto imports from Mexico troubles Sam Stovall, U.S. equity strategist for S&P Global Market Intelligence. \u201cThat\u2019s certainly going to hurt, because basically everything is imported, either in U.S. or foreign-made cars,\u201d he said. And tariffs often spark retaliation, affecting U.S. exports as well.\n\nOn the other hand, if the tough talk succeeds in wresting concessions from partners, it could improve our trading position, Stovall said.\n\n\u25a0Your job: If Trump\u2019s tariffs were enacted, including a 45 percent levy on Chinese goods, it would badly damage the economy and cost a lot of jobs, said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics. And if his tough immigration stance were put in place, Zandi warned, \u201cIt would be, to steal a phrase from him, a disaster.\n\n\u201cIf Trump could deport even a fraction of the 11 million immigrants, it would be very disruptive to business,\u201d he said, creating a hole in an important sector of the labor force and removing a lot of consumers from the economy.\n\n\u201cIf he deported all 11 million, it could lead to a recession. It would be a mess.\u201d\n\n\u25a0Your investments: Repatriating foreign earnings and possibly enacting some corporate tax reform, as Trump has discussed, could bolster stocks and benefit investors.\n\nCompanies have twice as much cash on their books as they did 10 years ago, Stovall noted, and a lot of it is overseas. If they get more favorable tax treatment in the U.S. and bring that money back, they \u201cwill have additional money with which to do dividends, do share buybacks, and it could help companies looking to build new plants and equipment.\u201d\n\nThat, he said, could bring \u201cbetter performance of the shares of the companies that we\u2019re invested in in our 401(k)s.\u201d\n\nBut a repeal of the Affordable Care Act \u201cwould do nothing but throw the health care industry into a tailspin,\u201d Stovall said.\n\nA recent change in the candidate\u2019s views on the minimum wage would affect such industries as retail and restaurants. Trump said earlier that he would not raise the wage but now says he is \u201copen to doing something\u201d with it, though Stovall doesn\u2019t think he would go as far as $15 an hour.\n\nThere really is something to the maxim that Wall Street dislikes uncertainty, said Hamrick. It weighs on financial markets and the performance of the economy.\n\n\u201cThat Trump is unpredictable is quite distasteful for many people trying to price in risk and opportunity,\u201d he said. \u201cCertain businesses are going to be cautious about making investments until they have a bit more clarity, and that includes clarity on how the leadership of the Congress is determined. There\u2019s a lot of cash sloshing around in the system, but it\u2019s not being put to work.\u201d\n\nIf a business is booming, the uncertainly is less of a factor, he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re a business on the margin, however, and wondering if you should take a risk, you might be more risk-averse.\u201d\n\n\u25a0Your taxes: The Tax Policy Center, which analyzed Trump\u2019s proposal to reduce marginal rates for individuals and businesses while boosting standard deductions, says the plan would provide an average tax cut of $1.3 million to the top 0.1 percent of earners. It could also mean $9.5 trillion less in federal revenue over its first decade, the center figures. If huge spending cuts don\u2019t come with it, the group said, it \u201ccould increase the national debt by nearly 80 percent of gross domestic product by 2036, offsetting some or all of the incentive effects of the tax cuts.\u201d\n\nThe proposal is in flux, however. Trump told CBNC this week that \u201cwhen you put out a tax plan, you are going to start negotiating.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: http://detne.ws/2711VHb", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Labor force, food production could be affected, for better or worse", "og": {"site_name": "Detroit News", "description": "Labor force, food production could be affected, for better or worse", "title": "What a President Trump might mean for personal finances", "url": "http://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/personal-finance/2016/05/06/president-trump-might-mean-personal-finances/84038808/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/detroitnews.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Labor force, food production could be affected, for better or worse", "title": "What a President Trump might mean for personal finances", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c7055172579d1f362d8483249f35fc75f24fdaeb/c=863-0-3453-2590&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/05/06/DetroitNews/B99391303Z.1_20160506164215_000_GFSU9N94.2-0.jpg", "creator": "@detroitnews", "site": "@detroitnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=904391631", "fb": {"app_id": 175422022549521}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Trump,election,personal finance"}, "article_summary": "Trump told CBNC this week that \u201cwhen you put out a tax plan, you are going to start negotiating.\u201dRead or Share this story: http://detne.ws/2711VHb\nIn this Friday, April 15, 2016, file photo, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks during a campaign event in Hartford, Conn.\n\u201cThat Trump is unpredictable is quite distasteful for many people trying to price in risk and opportunity,\u201d he said.\nIt could also mean $9.5 trillion less in federal revenue over its first decade, the center figures.\nIt would be a mess.\u201d\u25a0Your investments: Repatriating foreign earnings and possibly enacting some corporate tax reform, as Trump has discussed, could bolster stocks and benefit investors."}
