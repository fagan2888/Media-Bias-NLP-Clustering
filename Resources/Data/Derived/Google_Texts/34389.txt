Spotlight on… Joe Thornton, center, Sharks

When: The Avalanche plays Wednesday at 8:30 p.m. MDT at San Jose’s SAP Center.

What’s up: In opening a three-game California trip, their final road excursion of the season, the Avs will meet Joe Thornton and the Sharks.

Background: The strain is showing for the Sharks, long known as one of the NHL’s most respected operations, yet a team that hasn’t been able to get over the hump to the Stanley Cup Finals.

The Sharks probably will miss the playoffs for the first time since 2003, and longtime general manager Doug Wilson angered Thornton with an attempt to explain to season-ticket holders why stripping the veteran center of the captaincy was designed to take pressure off him. Thornton responded that Wilson needed to “shut his mouth,” and Sharks owner Hasso Plattner wisely told them to keep disagreements in-house. Since, Thornton and Wilson allegedly have buried the hatchet. (Yeah, right.)

Frei’s take: Last year, the Sharks won the first three games of their first-round playoff series against the Kings and then collapsed. The Kings went on to win the Stanley Cup.

That embarrassment led to conclusions it was time for the Sharks to do some housecleaning and paring, and to try to rebuild on the fly.

One of the issues will be whether the Wilson-Thornton relationship is irreparable and one or the other needs to go.

Caught in the middle is coach Todd McLellan. He has been with the Sharks since 2008, when he moved over from Mike Babcock’s Red Wings staff.
