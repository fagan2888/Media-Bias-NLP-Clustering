How will this influence the outcomes of Hobby Lobby and other cases where the plaintiffs claim a moral high ground?\n\nThis year the U.S. Supreme Court will rule on at least two cases that weigh constitutional and statutory law against religious or moral beliefs. Both involve challenges to the Obamacare provision that requires for-profit companies to offer health insurance policies that cover contraception. In Conestoga Wood Specialties Corp. v. Secretary, etc., a national wood-supply company and its owners assert that they are entitled to an exemption based on their Mennonite owners\u2019 view that contraception \u201cis intrinsic evil and a sin against God to which they are held accountable.\u201d In Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., et al. v. Sibelius, Hobby Lobby and its owners argue that they operate under Christian principles and that it would be \u201cimmoral\u201d for them to provide contraception coverage.\n\nThe court is also likely to hear a third case: In Gilardi v. U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services, a court of appeals case decided in November, the court held that the contraception mandate violated the constitutional and statutory rights of the plaintiffs, two Roman Catholic brothers who own a food-processing company. The judge who wrote the opinion, Janice Rogers Brown, has frequently been mentioned as a potential Republican candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court. According to a 2006 New York Times article by David D. Kirkpatrick, Brown \u201chas often argued that judges should look to higher authority than precedent or man made laws in making decisions.\u201d Her opinion in the Gilardi case relies explicitly on \u201cmoral\u201d law in interpreting the Constitution and statutes. Forcing the Gilardi brothers to comply with the contraception mandate, she wrote, would be a \u201ccompelled affirmation of a repugnant belief.\u201d She said the Affordable Care Act forces the plaintiffs to make a \u201cHobson\u2019s choice\u201d: Either they refuse to provide contraception coverage and pay a large monetary penalty, \u201cor they become complicit in a grave moral wrong.\u201d If natural law exists, what is in it? Is it a blank slate on which anyone may write subjective beliefs? If Judge Brown believes that constitutional and statutory law must yield to a \u201chigher authority,\u201d she isn\u2019t alone. In 1991, shortly before Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas\u2019s Senate confirmation hearings, Harvard Law School professor Laurence H. Tribe wrote in The New York Times that Thomas was \u201cthe first Supreme Court nominee in 50 years to maintain that natural law should be readily consulted in constitutional interpretation.\u201d Thomas was repeatedly grilled on this point during the hearings that followed. Though he acknowledged that the Constitution is \u201c[t]he positive law,\u201d he added, \u201cWe look at natural law beliefs of the Founders as a background to our Constitution.\u201d Many natural-law believers cite Thomas Jefferson\u2019s Declaration of Independence to support their beliefs. In the familiar opening lines, Jefferson wrote:\n\nWhen, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and of nature\u2019s God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation. And then: We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. In this powerful language, Jefferson cited every possible source of the rights the new country was claiming. They came from \u201cpowers of the earth,\u201d from \u201claws of nature and of nature\u2019s God\u201d; they were \u201cself evident,\u201d and \u201cendowed by [a] Creator.\u201d By investing the rights with a divine origin, the Declaration elevated them. These were not mere political rights. They were higher, transcendent rights that were \u201cunalienable.\u201d If the rights were God-given, they could neither be denied nor withdrawn by the target of the Declaration, Britain\u2019s King George III. The Declaration\u2019s natural-law position embraced an ancient tradition of religious thought. Over 500 years earlier, Thomas Aquinas, the 13th-century Dominican priest and theologian, had made natural law a cornerstone of Roman Catholic philosophy. In the centuries that followed, natural-law advocates grounded their theories on religion-based theology, or simply found them \u201cself evident,\u201d the phrase Jefferson used. None of these believers attempted to provide an empirical basis for natural rights. If natural law were regarded as simply a religious creed, it would not conflict with the positive laws embedded in our Constitution and laws. The threat lies in the use of natural law by courts in judicial decisions. Invoking it in construing the Constitution and statutes raises an obvious question: If natural law exists, what is in it? Is it a blank slate on which anyone may write subjective beliefs? Does it include religious dogmas? If so, of what religions?", "article_metadata": {"description": "At least two Supreme Court justices think there&#39;s a divine legal code underlying the Constitution.
