But this year presents an amazing opportunity in terms of technology, given Levi\u2019s Stadium\u2019s state-of-the art technology and the connectivity in and around the Silicon Valley,\u201d Michelle McKenna-Doyle, the NFL\u2019s chief information officer, said via e-mail.\n\nThe Santa Clara stadium features 40 gigabits per second of Internet bandwidth, massive video boards and more cameras than other professional football venues, offering fans at least six replay angles per play and plenty of Wi-Fi to use mobile apps to get food delivered to their seats, snap selfies and text their friends.\n\nDesigners of Levi\u2019s Stadium said when construction on the $1.3 billion venue started in 2012, San Francisco 49ers co-chairman John York wanted a next-generation football stadium that wasn\u2019t only environmentally friendly but reflective of the area\u2019s culture of innovation.\n\n\u201cSitting there in the valley and surrounded by where the birthplace of technology is, there was a very high expectation of what would be done in the building,\u201d said Lanson Nichols, vice president at HNTB and senior project manager for Levi\u2019s Stadium. \u201cIt\u2019s a platform that facilitates a lot of different things, not just the events, but the ability to host the technology and drive that as another element of the fan experience.\u201d\n\nThe open space celebrates California\u2019s sunny weather. Lower seating creates a more collegiate feel. And local materials, including reclaimed redwood from the Hangar One facility at Moffett Field in Mountain View, fill the stadium.\n\n\u201cWhen people see a picture now of Levi\u2019s Stadium, they know it\u2019s in the San Francisco Bay Area. We\u2019re really proud of the fact that Levi\u2019s is about the Bay Area and its culture,\u201d said Tim Cahill, senior vice president and chief design officer at HNTB and chief design principal for Levi\u2019s Stadium.\n\nVenueNext CEO John Paul said a separate app will launch for Super Bowl 50 that includes extra features on top of what fans already get with the Levi\u2019s Stadium app, which the tech firm developed. The new app will:\n\n\u2022 Allow people at the game to view a Super Bowl commercial once it airs on television.\n\n\u2022 Provide images from a live camera so attendees can see celebrities at the stadium.\n\n\u2022 Help with express pickup for merchandise.\n\nAbout 30 percent of fans at Levi\u2019s Stadium use the stadium app during 49ers games, allowing them to watch video replays, order food, check a bathroom line, find better parking or explore the venue, Paul said. During other sports games, he noted, mobile use has been higher. And while there are still fans who stay away from using a smartphone, he expects that will become more rare in the future.\n\nThe tech firm has tested the Super Bowl app for the last three games at Levi\u2019s Stadium, and with the massive amount of bandwidth at the stadium, VenueNext is confident it won\u2019t freeze on game day.\n\n\u201cOur system has never had any significant failures during big events, so we\u2019re keeping our fingers crossed that I haven\u2019t jinxed us by saying that,\u201d he said.\n\nOutside of fans attending a game in person because they want to see a team live, some also want to brag about being there on social media. Facebook unveiled a new feature recently that allows people to view live stats, comments from friends, news stories and more by searching for the game.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Next-generation Levi\u2019s Stadium is jewel of Silicon Valley", "title": "Next-generation Levi\u2019s Stadium is jewel of Silicon Valley", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/02/06/next-generation-levis-stadium-is-jewel-of-silicon-valley/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160206__BN20160207_CC25_BNSP07FBNLEVISp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160206__BN20160207_CC25_BNSP07FBNLEVISp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-06T20:12:14+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-18T06:10:46+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Super Bowl 2016"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWhen people see a picture now of Levi\u2019s Stadium, they know it\u2019s in the San Francisco Bay Area.\nWe\u2019re really proud of the fact that Levi\u2019s is about the Bay Area and its culture,\u201d said Tim Cahill, senior vice president and chief design officer at HNTB and chief design principal for Levi\u2019s Stadium.\n\u201cEvery year, fans (going) to the Super Bowl become more connected and more tech-savvy.\nThe new app will:\u2022 Allow people at the game to view a Super Bowl commercial once it airs on television.\nDesigners of Levi\u2019s Stadium said when construction on the $1.3 billion venue started in 2012, San Francisco 49ers co-chairman John York wanted a next-generation football stadium that wasn\u2019t only environmentally friendly but reflective of the area\u2019s culture of innovation."}
