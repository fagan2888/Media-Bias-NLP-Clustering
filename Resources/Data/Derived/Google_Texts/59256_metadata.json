You may encounter wide swings in income and tax due from one year to the next if you don\u2019t check in with your advisers.\n\n\u201cFall is the best time for tax planning,\u201d says Tracy Kaufman, CPA, a principal at Rea & Associates. \u201cBy now, the majority of the year has gone by, and you have a good feeling for what the rest of the year is going to be like. If you wait until after the year-end, it\u2019s too late. It\u2019s also a good time to explore additional ideas like profit sharing/retirement contributions, bonuses and review of insurance.\u201d\n\nSmart Business spoke with Kaufman and Joe Popp, JD, LLM, a tax manager at Rea & Associates, about some best practices that will help your company prepare for the upcoming tax season.\n\nAre there certain tax law changes that companies need to plan for?\n\nThere are a number of tax provisions that are in flux each year, but unfortunately, Congress has not acted to extend them yet. Some programs like the Section 179, bonus depreciation, and Research and Experimentation Tax Credit are usually extended every year, but that hasn\u2019t been confirmed yet for 2015.\n\nWe do know some changes related to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and insurance in general. First, companies that extend coverage to spouses must now recognize and cover same-sex spouses, as well.\n\nSecond, employers with 50 or more full-time employees must file Form 1095-C, which is like a W2 for health care. If you need to do this reporting, you must determine who is collecting the data and populating the forms right now as many providers have stopped accepting new projects. Are you doing it internally, through your payroll company or CPA firm?\n\nWith this uncertainty, how can employers get ready now?\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of planning that you can do already. Provide your accountant with your income so far and a projection for the rest of the year. Then, you\u2019ll be able to see what actions to take to help your tax situation or changes to make to take advantage of a particular credit or program. You also can determine how much goes into the company retirement plan or what bonuses need to go out by the end of the year.\n\nWith an S corporation or partnership, it\u2019s important to remember that your income trickles down to your individual return, so you need to be planning on both sides, and account for state taxes due.\n\nAs companies evolve, they often become more complex, which may mean that a different type of retirement or corporate structure will be more useful. If you\u2019ve added employees, you also may have crossed a threshold that relates to the ACA.\n\nInstead of trying to follow a cookie-cutter checklist, sit down with your professional advisers and discuss your unique situation and needs, as well as any significant changes.\n\nWhat\u2019s the biggest mistake you see employers make?\n\nBusiness leaders make a change, and then ask an accountant or tax adviser about it. By then, it\u2019s often too late. Your advisers\u2019 hands are tied, and the available options are severely limited. You may face adverse tax consequences or not be able to utilize a more advantageous tax treatment.\n\nFor example, you might add another line of business or incorporate it into your organization without consulting your professional team, and it would have been better to be structured as a different type of entity.\n\nIf you\u2019ve already negotiated a deal, it may not be practical to change it, even though you haven\u2019t signed the final papers. This kind of thing happens all the time.\n\nTax planning is important, so as soon as you start talking about a potential change, call your CPA. An ounce of prevention today is worth a pound of cure tomorrow.\n\nInsights Accounting is brought to you by Rea & Associates", "article_metadata": {"shareaholic": {"site_name": "Smart Business Magazine", "language": "en-US", "url": "http://www.sbnonline.com/article/what-companies-can-do-now-to-get-ready-for-the-2016-tax-season/", "article_author_name": "Jayne Gest", "site_id": "75b6dd55541159703e2dcc47492301ad", "article_published_time": "2015-10-01T20:15:46+00:00", "shareable_page": "true", "article_modified_time": "2016-05-26T04:01:44+00:00", "keywords": "joe popp, rea & associates, tracy kaufman, tax season", "wp_version": "7.8.0.1"}, "description": "It\u2019s time to do your business tax planning and, just like a doctor\u2019s check-up, if you decide to skip it, you may regret it.", "og": {"site_name": "Smart Business Magazine", "description": "It\u2019s time to do your business tax planning and, just like a doctor\u2019s check-up, if you decide to skip it, you may regret it.", "title": "What companies can do now to get ready for the 2016 tax season - Smart Business Magazine", "locale": "en_US", "url": "http://www.sbnonline.com/article/what-companies-can-do-now-to-get-ready-for-the-2016-tax-season/", "type": "article"}, "robots": "noodp", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/SmartBusiness/", "tag": "Tracy Kaufman"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe20f9\"", "article_summary": "It\u2019s time to do your business tax planning and, just like a doctor\u2019s check-up, if you decide to skip it, you may regret it.\nAre there certain tax law changes that companies need to plan for?\nTax planning is important, so as soon as you start talking about a potential change, call your CPA.\n\u201cFall is the best time for tax planning,\u201d says Tracy Kaufman, CPA, a principal at Rea & Associates.\nYou may face adverse tax consequences or not be able to utilize a more advantageous tax treatment."}
