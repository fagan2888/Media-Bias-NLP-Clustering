In a healthcare landscape where nothing stays in one place for long, innovation is the order of the day.

Health systems and hospitals are increasingly drawing on the "Shark Tank" model to solicit ideas. For example, at a recent "Innovation Summit" at Boston Children's Hospital, finalists pitched healthcare improvement ideas to a panel of experts, while Brigham and Women's Hospital held a similar contest in search of new mobile apps to improve outpatient engagement and inpatient experience.

"This is all happening because healthcare organizations are really feeling the pressure to get on outcomes and cost improvements quickly," Twine CEO John Moore, M.D., told Hospitals & Health Networks earlier this year. "They're going to start taking on more and more risk, and they know that if they don't move quickly, they're going to have a hard time."

Perhaps it's only fitting that this emphasis on innovation in healthcare has itself led to an innovation: the idea of the healthcare innovation center, in which healthcare leaders--often chief innovation officers--work within their own organizations and with others in and out of the hospital sector to foster the next generation of big ideas in healthcare.

In this special report, FierceHealthcare looks at five such centers and how they're changing the game for healthcare innovation.
