The money will go to the Democratic campaign committees for both House and Senate candidates.\n\nAs far as such fundraising trips are concerned, Obama has lapped his two-term predecessors, and not by a little.\n\nThe Guardian's Dan Roberts and Kenton Powell compared Obama's fundraising efforts to other recent two-term presidents. They found that since April, Obama has made 30 fundraising trips to close the deal with wealthy donors. They write:\n\n\"Although unable to run again for election himself, Obama is estimated to have raised up to $40m for other Democrats since his last inauguration in January as he devotes a growing portion of the second term to financing efforts aimed at winning back control of Congress in next year's midterm elections. ... George W Bush attended just 11 similar events, Bill Clinton managed 18 and Ronald Reagan only 10.\"\n\nThat kind of devotion to getting rich people to write checks has helped the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee outpace its Republican counterpart. The DCCC has raised $62.5 million so far in 2013, $10 million more than the National Republican Congressional Committee.\n\nDemocrats once hoped Obama's aggressive fundraising would boost their chances of recapturing House control (that was always a longshot; even in relatively good times, few experts thought they could net the required 17 seats.) The Affordable Care Act's troubles now have House and Senate Democrats hoping to just keep what they have. That's especially true for Senate Democrats and their narrow majority. A net Democratic loss of six seats would flip control to Republicans.\n\nThe present political reality for congressional Democrats is that they'll likely need every dollar the president can raise to overcome the headwinds created for them by the HealthCare.Gov fiasco and the health-plan policy cancellations blamed on Obamacare. Republicans have already signaled that Obamacare will be the turf much of their 2014 congressional campaigns will be fought on.\n\nIf there's any good news for Democrats in all of this, it's that Obama excels at fundraising and genuinely seems to enjoy it. As the president told a group of wealthy Democratic donors gathered at Saban's ample estate:\n\n\"We are at an event here because we understand that part of our democracy, part of this amazing experience we're engaged in, is we gotta run around, we gotta raise money and we gotta make speeches. We gotta go to rallies and get folks fired up. We've gotta engage in the process. And that's a good thing, that's a healthy thing.\"\n\nSo Democrats should have plenty of ready money if Obama maintains his current fundraising pace.", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "description": "While vulnerable congressional Democrats might politely decline a local appearance by President Obama on their behalf, the money he's raising for their campaigns is an entirely different matter.", "og": {"site_name": "NPR.org", "description": "While vulnerable congressional Democrats might politely decline a local appearance by President Obama on their behalf, the money he's raising for their campaigns is an entirely different matter.", "title": "Obama Helps 2014 Democrats One Way He Still Can \u2014 With Cash", "url": "http://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2013/11/26/247397816/obama-helps-2014-democrats-one-way-he-still-can-with-cash", "image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2013/11/26/obama-on-marine-one_wide-e5fdd22c4fa24da84b59f65685d87bda867affcc.jpg?s=1400", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "npr.org", "image": {"src": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2013/11/26/obama-on-marine-one_wide-e5fdd22c4fa24da84b59f65685d87bda867affcc.jpg?s=1400"}, "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@NPR"}, "robots": "noarchive,index,follow", "fb": {"app_id": 138837436154588, "pages": 10643211755}, "date": "2013-11-26", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no, shrink-to-fit=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcedb0\"", "article_summary": "The Affordable Care Act's troubles now have House and Senate Democrats hoping to just keep what they have.\nThat kind of devotion to getting rich people to write checks has helped the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee outpace its Republican counterpart.\nSo Democrats should have plenty of ready money if Obama maintains his current fundraising pace.\nIf Obama has anything to do with it, Democrats facing election next November will at least have plenty of help from that reliable friend.\nThat's especially true for Senate Democrats and their narrow majority."}
