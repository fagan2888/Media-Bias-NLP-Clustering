Denver police Sunday evening shot a man who was coming at two police officers with a knife after a short foot chase around 7 p.m., Police Chief Robert White said.

The man, who was taken by ambulance from the scene to Denver Health Medical Center, was described as being in very critical condition.

“He was coming at the police officers with a knife,” said White, who was at the scene at the Capital City Mobile Home Park, 4501 W. Kentucky Ave.

“We believe he stabbed his mother,” White said.

One officer fired several shots at the man, who was not named. White said the man reportedly stabbed his mother in the neck. Her injuries were not believed to be life threatening.

“The knife was relatively long,” White said and the man got “dangerously close” to the officers.

Residents said they heard three or four gunshots.

The shooting shook the family of Eden Longoria, who lives a couple trailers east of where the shooting occurred. His 7-year-old daughter was outside playing and said she heard three shots. His 18-year-old son and wife were at the police station Sunday night providing witness information.

“My son saw everything,” Longoria said.

He planned to have a family conversation as soon as possible to calm his children.

Kenneth Shaw, 19, a resident at 4545 Morrison Road, where the initial call came from, said he observed a woman who was crying sitting on the apartment steps.

After he heard the shots, the woman started screaming.

“She’s like, ‘My baby is dead. They shot him. I know they shot him,’ ” Shaw said.

“She looked fine she was walking around.”

The officer who fired the shots will be placed on administrative leave per police policy.
