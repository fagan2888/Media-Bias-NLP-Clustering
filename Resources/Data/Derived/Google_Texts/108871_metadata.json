The parties have agreed to negotiate a settlement in advance of the July trial date. The terms: Duke Energy pays $81M.\n\nThree corporations and an Ohio residential customer filed the suit in 2008. A little history will help make the issue clearer:\n\n2003: Cincinnati Gas & Electric, part of Cinergy, submitted a rate increase application.\n\n2004: Duke/Cinergy create an allegedly bogus subsidiary, Duke Energy Retail Sales.\n\n2006: Duke Energy merges with Cinergy.\n\n2015: Duke/Cinergy sell Duke Energy Retail Sales to Dynegy in Houston, Texas. The sale was a part of a $2.8B sale of Midwest power plants.\n\nThe plaintiffs claim that Duke Energy Retail Sales paid kickbacks to large business and industrial customers that agreed to withdraw their objections to the proposed rate increase. Sometime later, Ohio\u2019s utility commission approved the rate increase.\n\nDuke Energy Ohio insists that all customers were treated equally and fairly despite the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations. The settlement is the result of Duke\u2019s desire to avoid expensive litigation as well as the chance it could lose the suit.\n\nThe breakdown of the settlement is as follows:\n\n$25M for residential customers during the 2005-2008 period covered by the suit\n\n$25M to non-residential customers during the same time frame\n\n$8M for energy programs\n\nPayment of the plaintiffs\u2019 associated costs and legal fees\n\nWhile the settlement agreement has yet to be approved by a federal court in southern Ohio, Duke Energy Ohio has already recorded an $81M charge against its early 2015 earnings to cover the settlement.\n\nSource:\n\nJoin the Discussion", "article_metadata": {"description": "A suit against Duke Energy won\u2019t make it to trial after all.
