â€” Garner police were investigating Sunday morning after a woman was hit and killed in a crash near the intersection of Interstate 70 business and Yeargan Road.

According to investigators, the 22-year-old woman, who was identified Sunday night as Kayla Dion Higgins, was found at about 8 a.m., but is believed to have been hit overnight.

Garner police Captain Joe Binns said that the Higgins' purse was located Sunday afternoon in the 1300 block of Vandora Springs Road. Authorities believe she was hit sometime after 3:30 a.m.

"We don't have any leads on anybody that was driving on this part of the road so we're really looking for help from people today. If they know if anyone that has recent damage to their car overnight or someone was traveling down 70 may have seen something," said Lt. Binns.

Authorities said they believe they are looking for a minivan with an unknown make and model that likely has damage to the front or right side.

Anyone with information is asked to call police.
