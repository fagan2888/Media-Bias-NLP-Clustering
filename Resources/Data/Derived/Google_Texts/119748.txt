Thousands facing steep increases for Healthy Kids insurance can enroll in Obamacare until Nov. 30

Families wishing to drop their Florida Healthy Kids insurance plans can purchase new plans through the Obamacare marketplace, Florida Healthy Kids officials said.

The special enrollment period ends Nov. 30.

Federal officials decided to open enrollment for some 36,000 Florida families who pay the full rate for Healthy Kids coverage because their monthly premiums are set to double come Oct. 1.

Some of those families had been told they would have to wait for Nov. 1, when the Affordable Care Act marketplace will open for consumers across the country.

Families affected by the Healthy Kids rate increases can access the Affordable Care Act marketplace by visiting healthcare.gov or by calling (800) 318-2596. They must indicate that Sept. 30 is the last day of their coverage through Healthy Kids.

Florida Healthy Kids offers insurance plans for children 5 to 18 years old whose families make too much money to qualify for Medicaid. Families earning $48,500 or less qualify for subsidized coverage. Those earning more must pay the full premiums.
