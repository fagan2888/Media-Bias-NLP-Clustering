The Commodores, despite some sloppy moments in the first 20 minutes, would take a 35-25 lead into the intermission.\n\nThey would extend that lead in the second half, eventually winning the game 75-57. Elliott Cole leads the way with 27 points, as the Commodores win for the 4th straight time and take their record to 7-3.\n\nThe attached video shows the following:\n\nGulf Coast Friday in the home white, hosting Walters State. The Commodores working with a five point lead here, make it an 8 point lead when Elliott Cole gets it back on the wing and knocks down the three point shot.\n\nThen off the inbounds, Quavious Copeland picks it off, drives it all the way for two more, the lead at that point was 9.\n\nMore good ball movement a couple of minutes later, Rafael De Souza drives and then dishes to the big guy out of Nigeria, Folorusho Akande.\n\nAnd then it's DeMario Beck, a freshman out of Cochran, Georgia, with a nice baseline move, taking the hard hit but scores anyway. Gulf Coast leading it 35-25 at the half, they go on to win 75-57.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Panama City, FL---Gulf Coast opens up play in the two day Panama City Beach CVB Classic with a win over Walters State.", "language": "english", "author": "Scott Rossman", "og": {"description": "Panama City, FL---Gulf Coast opens up play in the two day Panama City Beach CVB Classic with a win over Walters State.", "title": "Commodores Win 4th Straight", "url": "http://www.wjhg.com/sports/headlines/Commodores-Win-4th-Straight--284193311.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/FB9/9DE/FB99DE819A6941FD8F710822A8650A07", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/987/7C9/9877C92BD9A442E4917D407DF8A91CEE.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.wjhg.com", "description": "Panama City, FL---Gulf Coast opens up play in the two day Panama City Beach CVB Classic with a win over Walters State.", "title": "Commodores Win 4th Straight", "url": "http://www.wjhg.com/sports/headlines/Commodores-Win-4th-Straight--284193311.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/7gchoops.jpg", "creator": "@WJHG_TV", "site": "@WJHG_TV", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Commodores Win 4th Straight", "google-site-verification": "orfdzs_E4bRXom1qluA34zerrmjsg4QfrlLSkrR3ZAQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8c47\"", "article_summary": "Elliott Cole leads the way with 27 points, as the Commodores win for the 4th straight time and take their record to 7-3.\nThe Commodores working with a five point lead here, make it an 8 point lead when Elliott Cole gets it back on the wing and knocks down the three point shot.\nThe Commodores, despite some sloppy moments in the first 20 minutes, would take a 35-25 lead into the intermission.\nGulf Coast leading it 35-25 at the half, they go on to win 75-57.\nGulf Coast would grab an early lead and hold that lead the entire way."}
