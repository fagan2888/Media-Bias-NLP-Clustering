The bill would also cut funding to the nationwide healthcare provider Planned Parenthood and is expected to force a veto from the president.\n\nReconciliation bills, which are supposed to tackle only policies that directly affect spending and taxes, require only 51 votes to pass, rather than the usual 60, and cannot be filibustered in the Senate. Conservatives have looked to the reconciliation process as a way to cut funding to Planned Parenthood and roll back Obamacare. Debate over the Senate version of the bill is expected to begin Wednesday at the latest, the Washington Post reported.\n\n\u201cWe told people that we would use reconciliation because it didn\u2019t require 60 votes, it required 51 votes, to do what we could to defund Planned Parenthood,\u201d Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, R-Tex., said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re going to follow through on.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Reuters/Jonathan Ernst\n\nThe House of Representatives voted in October, 240 to 189, to pass a reconciliation bill that would repeal the individual and employer mandate in Obamacare, which requires qualifying people and companies to buy or provide health insurance, and kill what's known as the Cadillac tax, which is levied on employer-sponsored health plans above a certain price. It also would cut funding to Planned Parenthood. If the Senate passes its version of the bill, it would have to be reconciled with the House version before it can head to the president's desk.\n\nSome GOP senators have threatened not to support the legislation because it does not repeal Obamacare in full -- only in part.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\n\u201cEach of us campaigned on a promise to fully repeal Obamacare and a reconciliation bill is the best way to send such legislation to President Obama\u2019s desk. If this bill cannot be amended so that it fully repeals Obamacare pursuant to Senate rules, we cannot support this bill,\u201d Republican Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida, both presidential candidates, as well as Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, said in a statement in October. Lee has since described himself as \"very encouraged\" about the Senate version of the bill.\n\nPlanned Parenthood is a nationwide men's and women's health services provider, offering sexually transmitted infections testing, regular checkups, birth control and other medical services. It receives some 52 million visitors a year. Planned Parenthood frequently comes under fire for providing abortions, which constitute just 3 percent of all its services.\n\nThe White House credits the Affordable Care Act, the 2010 law that overhauled healthcare in the United States, with helping 16.4 million people get healthcare coverage.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://s2.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "obamacare, 2016 presidential elections, republican hopefuls presidential elections, repeal obamacare, affordable care act, repeal affordable care act, how to repeal obamacare, opposition to obamacare, republicans trying to repeal obamacare, jeb bush, ted", "og": {"site_name": "International Business Times", "description": "Some Republicans vowed not to vote for the bill because they said it did not repeal enough parts of the law.", "title": "Repealing Obamacare 2015: Senate Republicans Could Vote This Week On Bill That Would Cut Affordable Care Act", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/repealing-obamacare-2015-senate-republicans-could-vote-week-bill-would-cut-affordable-2205971", "image": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2015/12/01/rtx1f6sg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Some Republicans vowed not to vote for the bill because they said it did not repeal enough parts of the law.", "title": "Repealing Obamacare 2015: Senate Republicans Could Vote This Week On Bill That Would Cut Affordable Care Act", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/repealing-obamacare-2015-senate-republicans-could-vote-week-bill-would-cut-affordable-2205971", "image": {"src": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2015/12/01/rtx1f6sg.jpg", "identifier": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2015/12/01/rtx1f6sg.jpg"}, "site": "@IBTimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "fb": {"app_id": 263851690471857, "pages": 128026713884051}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/IBTimes", "section": "World", "published_time": "2015-12-01T09:15:14-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-01T10:19:27-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Some Republicans vowed not to vote for the bill because they said it did not repeal enough parts of the law."}, "article_summary": "Debate over the Senate version of the bill is expected to begin Wednesday at the latest, the Washington Post reported.\nThe bill would also cut funding to the nationwide healthcare provider Planned Parenthood and is expected to force a veto from the president.\nPlanned Parenthood frequently comes under fire for providing abortions, which constitute just 3 percent of all its services.\nSome GOP senators have threatened not to support the legislation because it does not repeal Obamacare in full -- only in part.\nLee has since described himself as \"very encouraged\" about the Senate version of the bill."}
