Michael McCaul, R-Texas, last week at an event on terrorism at The Heritage Foundation. \u201cThis is terror gone viral.\u201d\n\nMcCaul, chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security, said ISIS, through its social media, recruiting in the West and terror operations elsewhere, has become a \u201cglobal menace\u201d that has caused jihadist attacks on American targets to triple in the last five years.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here to tell you radicalism is on the rise,\u201d said McCaul at the Heritage event. \u201cIf it can happen in Chattanooga, it can happen anywhere.\u201d\n\nDavid Inserra, a policy analyst in homeland security and cyber security at Heritage, said recent attacks have differed from those in the past. Most prior attacks, he said, were done by individuals inspired or directed by al-Qaeda, its affiliates or some other ideology. But all the plots this year, he said, have been directed or inspired by ISIS, and U.S. service personnel and facilities have emerged as its top targets, he said.\n\nTo combat ISIS and other terror threats, Edwin Meese, former U.S. attorney general under President Reagan, said the U.S. is fortunate to have the FBI, which has adapted to changes since 9/11 and can continue to adapt in the future to prevent terror plots from being executed.\n\n\u201cThe future of the FBI will be the way in which this country is protected against terrorism,\u201d Meese said.\n\nAdditionally, McCaul said, building a strong military and establishing a multinational coalition, overseen by the U.S., is necessary to eliminate terrorism.\n\n\u201cUltimately, we must recognize the best homeland defense is good offense,\u201d McCaul said. \u201cThere is no substitute for American leadership and right now, there is no other nation capable of rallying a coalition to this cause other than the United States of America.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "As rates of terrorism increase in 2015, experts identify solutions.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "As rates of terrorism increase in 2015, experts identify solutions.", "title": "How Much ISIS Is Plotting Against the US", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/zumaglobal435335.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-07-27T22:01:05+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1D5GkkQ"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "As rates of terrorism increase in 2015, experts identify solutions.", "title": "How Much ISIS Is Plotting Against the US", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/zumaglobal435335.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Security", "tag": "terrorism", "published_time": "2015-07-27T12:19:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-27T22:01:05+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Terrorism, ISIS, Jihad, terrorism, al-Qaeda, Michael McCaul, Middle East"}, "article_summary": "Not content with wreaking havoc on the Middle East, ISIS is bringing its terrorism to the West in general, the U.S. specifically and the U.S. military especially.\nOfficials have detected 33 ISIS-related plots against Western targets this year, 26 of them against the U.S., and 19 of those against U.S. military targets.\nBut all the plots this year, he said, have been directed or inspired by ISIS, and U.S. service personnel and facilities have emerged as its top targets, he said.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t terror as usual,\u201d said Rep.
