Trump told Fox News he considers former Democratic President Bill Clinton \u201cfair game.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe \u2018penchant for sexism\u2019 was exactly her words, and I just turned them,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought it was fine.\u201d\n\nIn a campaign in which Trump has mocked and degraded women so many times that it\u2019s hard to keep track, he seemed to have finally strayed into no-man\u2019s land last week during a rally in Grand Rapids, Mich. That\u2019s where he used the gross sexual term to characterize Clinton\u2019s 2008 loss and repeatedly declared it \u201cdisgusting\u201d that Clinton took a bathroom break during a recent Democratic presidential debate.\n\nRelated: Carson May Be Down, but He Doesn\u2019t Think He\u2019s Out\n\nBut it has become a reality of the 2016 GOP presidential campaign that virtually nothing Trump says \u2014 no matter how mean or outrageous or sexist \u2014 can hurt him with his followers. The more the media howls about Trump\u2019s transgressions, the more his core supporters dig in their heels.\n\nThis helps to explain why Trump continues to dominate a crowded GOP presidential field with 39 percent of the likely Republican vote, well ahead of challengers including Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, according to a recent CNN/ORC poll.\n\nDuring interviews aired today by Fox and ABC News, Trump crowed that he holds \u201ca very, very strong\u201d lead in the GOP race. He was also highly dismissive of Clinton, indicating that he would have no trouble beating her in the general election.\n\nDespite Clinton\u2019s relatively high negative numbers and her problems in overcoming voter distrust of her integrity, recent national polls show that she would do well against Trump in a general election matchup.\n\nFor instance, Trump would fall short in a general election competition held today against Clinton, according to a Dec. 21 Reuters/Ipsos poll. In that one-on-one match-up, Clinton would take 40 percent support of all voters to Trump's 29 percent.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Donald Trump couldn\u2019t wait beyond the holiday season to strike back at Hillary Clinton", "title": "Trump Warns That Bill Clinton Would Be \u2018Fair Game\u2019 in General Election", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/27/Trump-Warns-Bill-Clinton-Would-Be-Fair-Game-General-Election", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-electon-trump_3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/27/Trump-Warns-Bill-Clinton-Would-Be-Fair-Game-General-Election", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-electon-trump_3.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@ericpianin"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Donald Trump couldn\u2019t wait beyond the holiday season to strike back at Hillary Clinton", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIt\u2019s not the first time he\u2019s demonstrated a penchant for sexism,\u201d Clinton told the Des Moines Register.\nTrump told Fox News he considers former Democratic President Bill Clinton \u201cfair game.\u201d\u201cThe \u2018penchant for sexism\u2019 was exactly her words, and I just turned them,\u201d he said.\nFor instance, Trump would fall short in a general election competition held today against Clinton, according to a Dec. 21 Reuters/Ipsos poll.\n\u201cShe\u2019s playing that woman\u2019s card left and right, and women are more upset about it than anybody else, including most men,\u201d Trump told Fox News.\nRelated: Who Will Be Next to Drop Out of the GOP Presidential Race?"}
