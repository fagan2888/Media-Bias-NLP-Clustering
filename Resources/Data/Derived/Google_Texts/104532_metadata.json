In Manatee County, the sheriff's office --- not DCF --- oversees child protective investigations. Authorities haven't verified that Janiya is the body found in a freezer, \"but it is thought to be Janiya,\" Carroll said.\n\nHe added that Keishanna Thomas is being held on contempt of court charges for refusing to answer a judge's questions about Janiya's whereabouts. Family members who knew the child was missing alerted authorities after Thomas dropped off the locked freezer at a relative's home earlier this month.\n\nAs to the death of Chance Walsh, Carroll said, a call to a hotline warning of danger to the boy met the protocol to be accepted for investigation, but the hotline counselor thought it was hearsay.\n\n\"She didn't make the right call that day,\" he said. \"Unfortunately, in our work, when you don't make the right call on any day, it can have tragic consequences.\"\n\nThe counselor had a criminal-justice degree and a year's experience, Carroll said. \"We looked at her previous work history and she was doing a good job. \u2026We've moved her to another part of the agency that doesn't involve child welfare,\" he said.\n\nThe DCF chief told senators he'd asked for a quality-assurance review of the state abuse hotline following the baby's death. He also said he had tightened the hotline protocol early this year, following the death of Phoebe Jonchuck, whose father was accused of dropping her from a bridge into Tampa Bay.\n\nThe senators praised Carroll for his candor.\n\n\"When there's the death of a baby, you want to blame somebody, and DCF is the easy target,\" state Sen. Nancy Detert, R-Venice, said. \"We can pass all the laws in the world, but the only way you can prevent 100 percent of deaths is if there's even a whisper of bad parenting, the state takes the kid, and I don't think we're ready for that kind of a police state.\"\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "Florida Department of Children and Families Secretary Mike Carroll told a Senate panel late last week that the state's child-protection system appears to", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/dcf-boss-system-failure-latest-child-deaths", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/healthnewsfl/files/styles/medium/public/201409/DCF_Mike_Carroll_2.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Florida Department of Children and Families Secretary Mike Carroll told a Senate panel late last week that the state's child-protection system appears to", "title": "DCF Boss: 'System Failure' In Latest Child Deaths"}, "story_id": 451908088, "twitter": {"site": "@HealthNewsFL", "card": "summary", "creator": "@HealthNewsFL"}, "author": "Margie Menzel - News Service of Florida", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "DCF Boss: &#039;System Failure&#039; In Latest Child Deaths"}, "nid": 12454, "datePublished": "2015-10-26", "keywords": "Florida Department of Children and Families Secretary Mike Carroll, Florida\\'s child-protection system, Chance Walsh, Janiya Thomas, child deaths", "wordCount": 509, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0870\"", "article_summary": "\"In both these cases, there's no question we had system failure,\" Carroll told the Senate Children, Families and Elder Affairs Committee.\nCarroll told lawmakers he'd sent what is known as a Critical Incident Rapid Response Team to Bradenton to investigate the case.\nAuthorities haven't verified that Janiya is the body found in a freezer, \"but it is thought to be Janiya,\" Carroll said.\nThe DCF chief told senators he'd asked for a quality-assurance review of the state abuse hotline following the baby's death.\n\"When there's the death of a baby, you want to blame somebody, and DCF is the easy target,\" state Sen.
