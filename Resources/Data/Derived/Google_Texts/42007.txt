Richard Hoar, who served as the deputy chief of staff to Rep. Gus Bilirakis (R-Fla.), begins his first day as a vice president at the firm on Monday.The shop — which offers lobbying, public relations and political campaign services — has about six registered lobbyists and earned $1.18 million in lobbying revenue in 2013, according to records compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics. It is on pace to break that revenue figure this year.Hoar will have to abide by a “cooling off” period before he is able to lobby his former colleagues.“He has excellent command of transportation, travel and technology policy issues gained through assisting Rep. Bilirakis on his work with the House Energy and Commerce Committee. His experience will be particularly valuable to Banner clients such as Air Canada, HP and Tata Consultancy Services,” said George Thompson, a partner at the firm. “Richard is also a U.S. Army Reserve intelligence officer, which further strengthens Banner’s bench depth of counselors on defense issues.”The firm has expanded this year, hiring Molly Sheerer from the Koch Institute and Lynn Stinson, who leads Banner’s social media strategy initiatives.
