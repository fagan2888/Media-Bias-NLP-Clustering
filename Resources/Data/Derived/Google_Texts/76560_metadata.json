He has relatives, including his great-grandfather, who fought for the Confederacy.\n\n\u201cThe public education on that period of history is really abysmal and continues to get worse because no one wants to talk about it,\u201d said Little.\n\nBut the 66-year-old retired Texas National Guard colonel has plenty to say.\n\nOne sunny morning this week, he stood outside the Georgetown courthouse holding a Confederate flag and chatting with Anne Maduzia, a native Texan now studying in London who was in town visiting her brother. \u201cWilliamson County voted against secession,\u201d he said.\n\n+ Ralph Barrera Longtime friends, from left, Arlene Smith, Callie Wood and Laurie Peek-Norene, stop to chat about history with retired Col. Shelby Little ... read more Ralph Barrera \u00d7\n\nWhen the state of Texas decided to secede, however, the county sent troops \u2014 including a company called the Williamson County Grays \u2014 to fight for the Confederacy, Little said. He told Maduzia that Texas troops were more likely to be killed by Indians than Yankees because they were sent to fight in New Mexico and Arizona.\n\n\u201cThat surprises me,\u201d said Maduzia. She said she stopped to talk to Little because \u201che looks like Robert E. Lee holding a flag.\u201d\n\nLaurie Norene from near Sacramento, Calif., also stopped by to chat and get a picture taken with Little and two of her friends. \u201cHow can you stand wearing that wool suit?\u201d she asked Little.\n\n+ Ralph Barrera During the month of April, Shelby Little puts on a Confederate soldier uniform and stands by the Confederate memorial statue outside ... read more Ralph Barrera \u00d7\n\n\u201cYou get used to it,\u201d said Little. \u201cI spent a year in Saudi Arabia.\u201d\n\nLittle said he has used his experience as a tank commander and training officer in the Texas National Guard to teach officers in Saudi Arabia and in African countries how to conduct peacekeeping missions. It\u2019s part of his work for a company in the U.S. Department of State\u2019s program called Africa Contingency Operations Training and Assistance, he said.\n\nMost people are pleasant when they talk to him when he is in a Confederate uniform in front of the courthouse, Little said, but some aren\u2019t. \u201cI got called a Nazi yesterday by a man walking by with his dogs,\u201d he said.\n\nLittle said many of the people who disagree with what he\u2019s doing just say the word \u201cslavery.\u201d He said he doesn\u2019t condone slavery and that none of his relatives who fought in the Confederacy owned any slaves.\n\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t just all ignorant rednecks,\u201d said Little, who said he is part Chickasaw Indian.\n\nWhat\u2019s important for people to know, he said, is that many of the Confederate soldiers who returned to Williamson County from the war helped build up the area.\n\nThe founder of Southwestern University in Georgetown, Francis Asbury Mood, was in the Confederacy, Little said.\n\nLittle doesn\u2019t need official permission to stand by the statue in his uniform because he is on public property, said Connie Watson, a county spokeswoman.\n\nThe statue \u2014 built in 1916 by the United Daughters of the Confederacy \u2014 has been controversial. The Unitarian Universalist Church in Georgetown started a petition last fall to remove it, saying it was an ugly reminder of slavery and segregation. There also was a petition started in support of keeping the statue.\n\nThe Commissioners Court has not discussed the issue, Watson said. Any changes to the courthouse lawn and items such as statues would require the approval of the Texas Historical Commission, she said.\n\nAbout 100 people also protested in January against a Civil War-era ball at the courthouse as a fundraiser for the Williamson Museum, saying it was racist. Museum officials said the dance was held to help promote its Civil War exhibit.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Every day in April, Shelby Little puts on a Confederate soldier uniform and stands by a Confederate memorial statue outside the Williamson County courthouse.", "author": "By Claire Osborn - American-Statesman Staff", "og": {"url": "http://www.mystatesman.com/news/news/local/taking-a-stand-for-the-confederacy/nq3J4/", "image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2016/04/09/c1/cc/rbz-Confederate-Month-10.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Every day in April, Shelby Little puts on a Confederate soldier uniform and stands by a Confederate memorial statue outside the Williamson County courthouse.", "title": "Taking a stand for the Confederacy"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/resize/120x120/img/photos/2016/04/09/9a/6d/621confederatemonthRBZ0409.jpg", "description": "Every day in April, Shelby Little puts on a Confederate soldier uniform and stands by a Confederate memorial statue outside the Williamson County courthouse.", "card": "summary", "title": "Taking a stand for the Confederacy"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "myaas", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.mystatesman.com/news/news/local/taking-a-stand-for-the-confederacy/nq3J4/"}, "cmg_revpath": "/re/292/3307196/news/news/local/taking-a-stand-for-the-confederacy/nq3J4/", "keywords": "statesman,williamson county,local news,georgetown", "viewport": "shrink-to-fit=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "He said his mission is to educate the public because April is Confederate History Month.\n\u201cWilliamson County voted against secession,\u201d he said.\nLittle doesn\u2019t need official permission to stand by the statue in his uniform because he is on public property, said Connie Watson, a county spokeswoman.\nThe founder of Southwestern University in Georgetown, Francis Asbury Mood, was in the Confederacy, Little said.\n\u2018Public education on that period of history is abysmal \u2026 because no one wants to talk about it,\u2019 he says."}
