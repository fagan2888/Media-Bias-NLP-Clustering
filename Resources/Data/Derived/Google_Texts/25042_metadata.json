But already-sparse shelves could turn stark naked within a matter of minutes and stay naked for weeks, as few shops will have the necessary supply to meet consumer demand.\n\nWashington and Colorado both passed legislation to legalize marijuana in 2012. Colorado became the first state to begin selling weed, in January, and the move was viewed by many as an unheralded success. Supply waned initially, but within the first four months dispensaries took in $114 million in sales. Washington, meanwhile, with a rockier business model that prizes third-party farming rather than on-site growing and selling like in Colorado, won\u2019t have its stock ready in time.\n\n\"What do you do when your shelves are empty? Do I just send everybody home? Do we try and stay open? I can't pay people if we aren't selling anything,\" dispensary owner James Lathrop told Reuters.\n\nLathrop\u2019s plight, and that of dozens of other sellers, centers around a problem with licensing and regulatory approval. The state is slated to issue licenses on Monday to some 20 shops around Washington, but thousands more are waiting in the wings. It\u2019s because of the state\u2019s distribution model, which divorces sellers from a direct supply. Only 80 of the 2,600 applicants have been granted licenses so far. As Reuters reports, only a fraction of the total pot operation \u2014 10 football fields\u2019 worth of inconsumable cannabis, or 560,000 square feet \u2014 has been approved.\n\nColorado has seen little of this struggle in its meteoric rise so far this year. Since its January introduction, city- and county-wide murder rates in Denver have dropped 42.1 percent. Violent crime is down two percent, and property crimes are down 11.5 percent compared to the same period in 2013. Colorado\u2019s Gov. John Hickenlooper predicts cannabis will generate $1 billion in revenue by the end of the next fiscal year, or just under $134 million in tax revenue alone. If these projections are anything to go by, the state\u2019s confidence remains high.\n\n\"While the rest of the country's economy is slowly picking back up, we're thriving here in Colorado,\u201d Hickenlooper told BuzzFeed\u2019s Ben Smith in March.\n\nOver in Washington, meanwhile, growers and sellers share little of the celebration. James Lathrop, for instance, has found only one grower who can ship its supply to him in time for Tuesday. To meet the demand he plans to stick to a two-gram limit for purchase, and prices will shoot from around $15 to $20 per gram to as high as $25 to $30, depending on who shop owners are trying to sell to \u2014 tourists and novelty-seekers may be more inclined to shell out an extra five.\n\nUnlike Colorado\u2019s thriving edibles market, cannabis kitchens in Washington have yet to see regulatory approval. Many growers foresee production starting to ramp up to meet demand by the three-year mark, if they\u2019re lucky. Bob Leeds, co-owner of Seattle-based Sea of Green Farms, which got its license to grow and process cannabis in March, predicted a window of between three and five years, Reuters reports.\n\nThe first supply on Tuesday will sell out in a matter of minutes, Leeds said \u2014 a prediction that, given Colorado\u2019s success, seems reasonable. But that will be where the similarities end. After the first blockbusting line clamoring for legal weed, \u201cthere won't be any more until weeks from now.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "marijuana, legalization, washington, wont, match, colorados, rollout, weed, supply, comes, dry", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Washington and Colorado both legalized marijuana in 2012, but Washington's upcoming rollout won't be met with similar success.", "title": "Pot Is Finally Legal In Washington, But The State Has None To Sell", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/marijuana-legalization-washington-wont-match-colorados-rollout-weed-supply-comes-dry-291620", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/07/marijuana.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Washington and Colorado both legalized marijuana in 2012, but Washington's upcoming rollout won't be met with similar success.", "title": "Pot Is Finally Legal In Washington, But The State Has None To Sell", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/marijuana-legalization-washington-wont-match-colorados-rollout-weed-supply-comes-dry-291620", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/07/marijuana.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/07/marijuana.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Policy/Biz", "published_time": "2014-07-07T10:37:36-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-07T10:37:35-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Washington and Colorado both legalized marijuana in 2012, but Washington's upcoming rollout won't be met with similar success."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9993\"", "article_summary": "Washington, meanwhile, with a rockier business model that prizes third-party farming rather than on-site growing and selling like in Colorado, won\u2019t have its stock ready in time.\nAfter the first blockbusting line clamoring for legal weed, \u201cthere won't be any more until weeks from now.\u201d\nWashington and Colorado both passed legislation to legalize marijuana in 2012.\nColorado became the first state to begin selling weed, in January, and the move was viewed by many as an unheralded success.\nThe first supply on Tuesday will sell out in a matter of minutes, Leeds said \u2014 a prediction that, given Colorado\u2019s success, seems reasonable."}
