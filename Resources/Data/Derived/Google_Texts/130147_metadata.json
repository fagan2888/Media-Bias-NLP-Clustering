Cannon - March 23, 2015\n\nLaunching his 2016 presidential candidacy, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz asks us to \u201cimagine\u201d\u2014his word\u2014a world without Obamacare, Common Core education standards, gun control, and a president afraid of uttering the phrase \u201cradical Islamic terrorism.\u201d\n\nOkay, I can do that, but that\u2019s not all Ted Cruz has in mind. In Monday\u2019s announcement, the freshman senator from Texas also asked Americans to essentially imagine a world without tax collectors, political moderates, liberals, atheists, gay marriage\u2014and voters old enough to remember John Lennon\u2019s music.\n\n\u201cImagine there\u2019s no heaven,\u201d Lennon\u2019s classic begins. In the second verse, he really gets going: \u201cImagine there\u2019s no countries,\u201d he sings. \u201cIt isn\u2019t hard to do. Nothing to kill or die for\u2014and no religion, too. Imagine all the people, living life in peace\u2026\u201d\n\nPeace isn\u2019t exactly what Cruz has in mind. Civil war inside the Republican Party is more like it. Speaking on the fifth anniversary of the signing of the Affordable Care Act, Ted Cruz urged his youthful audience at Liberty University to imagine a day in January 2017, when a President Ted Cruz signs legislation \u201crepealing every word of Obamacare.\u201d He said the same thing about Common Core and the Obama administration\u2019s immigration policies, which is de rigueur political rhetoric for conservatives these days.\n\nBut with his ultra-thin r\u00e9sum\u00e9, Ted Cruz cannot afford to sound like a generic conservative. So then he added this: \u201cImagine abolishing the IRS.\u201d At the risk of sounding ungenerous, this is just kooky. Cruz didn\u2019t go anywhere with that idea, but where could he go, really? He prefaced his brief tax talk by characterizing the nation\u2019s current tax code as one \u201cthat crushes innovation,\u201d which assumes facts not in evidence, before adding: \u201cImagine a simple flat tax that lets every American fill out his or her taxes on a postcard.\u201d\n\nNot to sound pedantic, but if there\u2019s no Internal Revenue Service, where should I send that post card? To whom do I pay my taxes? And if my neighbor, balking perhaps at President Cruz\u2019s governing priorities, refuses to even pay his \u201csimple flat tax,\u201d which government agency persuades him to pony up? Won\u2019t we need that tax money to fight radical Islamic terrorism?\n\nThere were other odd aspects to Cruz\u2019s speech, starting with its untraditional setting. The candidate wasn\u2019t in his home state of Texas, where other GOP officials view him with mistrust and voters must wonder why, after serving only two years as an elected official, Cruz thinks he deserves promotion to the highest office in the land. Instead, Cruz spoke at Liberty University, the famous Virginia Bible college founded by the Rev. Jerry Falwell.\n\nCruz was introduced there by Falwell\u2019s son and namesake, the current school president, who lauded his guest\u2019s willingness to buck the tide in the Senate. \u201cIt is easy to lead the charge when you have an army at your back,\u201d Falwell Jr. said. \u201cTed Cruz has gone against the tide. Has taken the road less traveled, and has proven himself to be a man of great character.\u201d\n\nBut that introduction only underscored another of Cruz\u2019s vulnerabilities: Most of his Republican colleagues in the Senate\u2014and we are talking about a very conservative cohort here\u2014cannot stand the guy.\n\nSo if his colleagues detest him, and the Texas GOP establishment is dividing mostly between former Govs. Rick Perry and Jeb Bush of Florida, what is Ted Cruz\u2019s natural constituency? To hear him tell it at Liberty University, it is the \u201cmillions of courageous conservatives\u201d out there, especially young people.\n\nThis is an interesting gambit. I don\u2019t know what percentage of American voters consider themselves to be courageous, but I do know how many consider themselves conservative. According to the Gallup Poll, it\u2019s 38 percent. Although this is significantly more than self-identified liberals, it is far short of the number needed to elect a president.\n\nIn 2012, Mitt Romney was excoriated for his self-defeating claim that \u201c47 percent of the people will vote [Democratic] no matter what.\u201d Ted Cruz makes Romney seem like a populist by contrast. Cruz also turns on its head Jeb Bush\u2019s assurance to Republican donors that he won\u2019t campaign for the primary in a way that makes a general election victory impossible. That\u2019s exactly what Cruz is proposing, whether he realizes it or not.\n\nHere\u2019s one key story line to keep in mind: If you are a conservative or an independent\u2014and independent-mind voters determine the outcome of every close national election\u2014the moral of the Obama presidency is not that experience is unimportant. Quite the opposite, actually. This is a complaint even many loyal Democrats have about the president. But Ted Cruz has even less experience in American public life\u2014considerably less, actually\u2014than Obama did when he started running for president in 2007.\n\nIn place of a cogent rationale for his candidacy, or any explanation about his path to the presidency, Cruz offered aspirational rhetoric. That word \u201cimagine\u201d\u2014he used it 38 times Monday. Many of the references came in the biographical description of his family and his family\u2019s faith, and the description of his educational and work journey, all of which comprised the first third of his speech. This part was as evocative an explication of the American Dream as we are likely to hear on the 2016 campaign trail. Too bad he couldn\u2019t have stopped there.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Launching his 2016 presidential candidacy, Republican Sen.
