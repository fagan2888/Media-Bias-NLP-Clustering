He could offer a new image for the GOP, without sacrificing its policy positions. And after an aborted attempt at immigration reform\u2014led by the party\u2019s erstwhile star, Florida Senator Marco Rubio\u2014the GOP adopted this approach. New rhetoric and a softer tone, without the divisiveness of new policies.\n\nBut, unfortunately for the Louisiana governor, the Jindal approach didn\u2019t include Bobby Jindal. Unpopularity in his home state, coupled with the rise of a new star in the form of Ted Cruz, left him in the dust, struggling to find a national constituency among Republicans. And whereas once he criticized the stupid, now\u2014desperate for political attention\u2014he has surrendered to his power. Which is how you get his recent rhetoric at the National Governor\u2019s Association meeting in Washington:\n\n\u201cThe Obama economy is now the minimum wage economy. I think we can do better than that, I think America can do better than that,\u201d said the potential 2016 presidential candidate, suggesting that the president approve the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, rein in regulations and expand drilling on federal lands to boost economic growth.\n\nAnd after a response from Connecticut Governor Daniel Malloy, Jindal declared that\u2014if the president really wanted to improve the economy\u2014he would delay the Affordable Care Act.\n\nNow, believe what you will about the Keystone XL pipeline, drilling, and Obamacare. The facts of the matter are that job gains from constructing the pipeline and commencing new drilling are small (and come at huge environmental cost), and there\u2019s no real evidence that the Affordable Care Act is hindering the economy. At most, it may shrink the supply of labor, as people leave work to retire early, raise kids, or pursue other non-wage interests.\n\nIn other words, Jindal has given up on his aura of intellectualism, and has committed completely to standing up for the stupid. And, given his clear presidential ambitions, we should expect more of this. Already, in addition to pushing nonsense ideas about the economy, he\u2019s pushing nonsense ideas about so-called \u201creligious freedom.\u201d Here he is, two weeks ago, defending Duck Dynasty and attacking liberals for their \u201cwar on religion\u201d:\n\nThis war is waged in our courts and in the halls of political power. It is pursued with grim and relentless determination by a group of like-minded elites, determined to transform the country from a land sustained by faith \u2014 into a land where faith is silenced, privatized, and circumscribed.\n\nAfter four years of failed debuts on the national stage, Jindal hopes that this \u201cwar\u201d against \u201celites\u201d will give his political career meaning. And this might play well with conservatives who have a persecution complex. For everyone else\u2014including most American believers\u2014it falls flat.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "@jbouie"}, "keywords": "U.S. Politics", "publicationDate": 201402251610, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/voxbox/jamelle-bouie", "description": "More than a year after saying Republicans need to not be the \u201cstupid party,\u201d the governor of Louisiana has given in to the dumb.", "pageNum": 1, "title": "Bobby Jindal Gives Up, Joins the 'Stupid Party'", "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Bobby Jindal Gives Up, Joins the \\\\u0027Stupid Party\\\\u0027\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/02/25/bobby-jindal-gives-up-joins-the-stupid-party.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/02/25/bobby-jindal-gives-up-joins-the-stupid-party/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/46444813.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/02/25/bobby-jindal-gives-up-joins-the-stupid-party\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-02-25T16:10:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"\",\"author\":\"Jamelle Bouie\",\"tags\":[\"u_s_politics0\"]}", "news_keywords": "US Politics", "tags": "u_s_politics0", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "Jamelle Bouie", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-25T16:10:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/jamelle-bouiehtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/02/25/bobby-jindal-gives-up-joins-the-stupid-party", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "More than a year after saying Republicans need to not be the \u201cstupid party,\u201d the governor of Louisiana has given in to the dumb.", "title": "Bobby Jindal Gives Up, Joins the 'Stupid Party'", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/02/25/bobby-jindal-gives-up-joins-the-stupid-party.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/02/25/bobby-jindal-gives-up-joins-the-stupid-party/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1393344410553.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "authorIds": "/etc/authors/j/jamelle-bouie", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca3fa\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be the last time anyone says something stupid within our party, but it can\u2019t be tolerated within our party.\u201c Republicans, said Jindal, \u201dshould stop being the stupid party\u201c and should \u201dfight for every single vote.\"\nMore than a year after saying Republicans need to not be the \u201cstupid party,\u201d the governor of Louisiana has given in to the dumb.\nBut, unfortunately for the Louisiana governor, the Jindal approach didn\u2019t include Bobby Jindal.\nIn the days after Mitt Romney\u2019s defeat in the 2012 election, conservative wunderkind and Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal stepped up with harsh criticism for his party.\nAfter four years of failed debuts on the national stage, Jindal hopes that this \u201cwar\u201d against \u201celites\u201d will give his political career meaning."}
