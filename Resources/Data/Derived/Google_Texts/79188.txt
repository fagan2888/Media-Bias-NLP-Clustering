Forecasters are calling for a 40 percent chance of late-afternoon rain or showers in Denver Wednesday and the extended forecast calls for continuing wet weather.

Skies will be mostly cloudy in Denver Wednesday and the high temperature should top out at about 50 degrees, according to the National Weather Service.

A flood warning is in effect until Friday evening for areas near the Cache La Poudre river in Weld County and the South Platte River in Weld, Morgan, Logan and Washington counties.

Rain is expected to return to Denver on Thursday with a slight chance of showers before 7 a.m. and then heavy showers in the afternoon and evening.

Weather service forecasters are calling for rivers and streams in the flood warning areas to crest on Thursday, rising to levels slightly above flood stages, before backing down late on Friday.

“There will be a continued chance of showers and thunderstorms in the mountains and on the nearby plains Thursday afternoon,” the weather service said in a bulletin. “The chance for showers and measurable precipitation will likely increase Thursday night with the passage of a weather disturbance packed with moisture.”

The service warns high country areas could see “measurable snowfall” by Friday morning, mainly on higher slopes and passes.

“Friday and Saturday should be drier and warmer, although areas in and near the mountains could see a few late day showers and thunderstorms,” the bulletin said.

A significant storm system is expected to move across the state and Wyoming on Sunday, bringing more rain and scattered thunderstorms as well as cooler temperatures.

Forecasters say a chance of showers and isolated thunderstorms may linger through mid-week after Memorial Day.
