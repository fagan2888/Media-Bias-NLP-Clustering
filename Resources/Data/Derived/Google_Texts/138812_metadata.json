In response, The Guy received this about another Cain puzzler from the Book of Genesis, chapter 4.\n\nHere\u2019s the story from \u201cGenesis: Translation and Commentary\u201d (Norton, 1996), a euphonious (look it up) rendition by Robert Alter. Cain was \u201ca tiller of the soil\u201d who \u201cbrought from the fruit of the soil an offering to the LORD. And Abel too had brought from the choice firstlings of his flock, and the LORD regarded Abel and his offering but He did not regard Cain and his offering.\u201d\n\nThen Cain \u201cwas very incensed, and his face fell.\u201d God said: \u201cWhy are you incensed, / and why is your face fallen? / For whether you offer well, / or whether you do not, / at the tent flap sin crouches / and for you is its longing / but you will rule over it.\u201d God\u2019s admonition did not overcome Cain\u2019s resentment and he murdered his brother.\n\nThe Bible doesn\u2019t state explicitly why God did not \u201cregard\u201d Cain and Cain\u2019s offering.\n\nBut a strong tradition uniting Jewish sages and Christians says there\u2019s an obvious though terse explanation in two words. Abel\u2019s gift was accepted as \u201cchoice,\u201d translated elsewhere as \u201cchoicest,\u201d \u201cfattest,\u201d \u201cfat portions,\u201d \u201cbest portions,\u201d \u201cbest part,\u201d or \u201cchoice cuts.\u201d Thus Abel returned to God some of the finest of what he had been given. Second, praiseworthy devotion is also seen because he set aside the \u201cfirstlings\u201d of God\u2019s gifts. Advocates of the tradition suppose that by contrast Cain\u2019s gift was half-hearted.\n\nIn the \u201cJerome Biblical Commentary,\u201d the late Catholic Father Eugene Maly concluded that the Bible here is teaching that our sacrifices \u201cmust be offered in the proper spirit.\u201d Maly thought that with Cain \u201cman\u2019s revolt against God leads to his revolt against his fellow man\u201d in the tragic first murder that confirmed humanity\u2019s \u201cfallen state\u201d portrayed earlier in Genesis.\n\nJust as Genesis shows Cain\u2019s flawed character in resentment toward Abel and God, the Christian New Testament praises Abel because he acted \u201cby faith\u201d (Hebrews 11:4) and 1 John 3:12 contrasts the two brothers\u2019 actions as \u201crighteous\u201d vs. \u201cevil.\u201d\n\nHowever, some modern analysts dispute all that.\n\nContinue reading \"Why did God spurn Cain's offering?\" by Richard Ostling.", "article_metadata": {"description": "JANE ASKS:\r\n\r\nWhy did God spurn Cain\u2019s offering?\r\n\r\nTHE RELIGION GUY ANSWERS:\r\n\r\nSome weeks ago our blog treated the classic Bible question of where Cain, \r\nAdam and Eve\u2019s first son, found his wife.
