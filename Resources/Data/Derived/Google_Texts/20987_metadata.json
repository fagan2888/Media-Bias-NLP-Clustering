The president was Franklin Delano Roosevelt.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe \u201cSecond Bill of Rights,\u201d unveiled during the State of the Union 70 years ago, was not a constitutional amendment but a statement of principles for America\u2019s economic future. It was centered on a commitment to achieving a crucial national objective: full employment.\n\nWith 50 million people, including 13 million children, now living below the poverty line and both parties seeking to address the national opportunity deficit in 2014, America\u2019s political leaders should take a cue from FDR\u2019s 1944 State of the Union. Congress should commit to do everything in its power to create the economic conditions for America to return to full employment. Getting every American working and contributing to the tax base will not only help eliminate poverty but also reduce the national debt and ultimately create the conditions for the free market to function well.\n\nIn the decades following FDR\u2019s speech, Congress took serious action to realize the vision of a full-employment society. It passed the Employment Act in 1946, giving the federal government tools and a formal calling to \u201cpromote maximum employment, production, and purchasing power.\u201d It passed a range of legislation to promote full employment through additional investments in transportation, health, education and research in the 1960s. Finally, in 1978, it passed the Humphrey-Hawkins Full Employment Act, calling on the president to work with the private sector to reduce unemployment to specific target levels.\n\nContrast these efforts with the inaction in today\u2019s Congress. With nearly 30 million American workers either unemployed or underemployed, each and every lawmaker should enshrine job creation as Priority No. 1. Yet Congress has actually made unemployment worse. The economic consulting firm Macroeconomic Advisers estimated that the fiscal showdowns and budget cuts that have consumed Congress over recent years have cost the country up to $700 billion in economic growth and more than 2 million jobs.\n\nAs collapsed bridges, contaminated water and falling positions in global education rankings demonstrate, there are plenty of public projects our country needs to undertake. This is why we\u2019ve been advocating for legislation \u2014 including the 21st Century Full Employment and Training Act and the American Jobs Act of 2013 \u2014 to create new opportunities to solve public problems while hiring educators, infrastructure-builders, first responders and medical researchers. There are good ideas in both parties for closing the skills gap, spurring infrastructure investment and reducing unemployment. But we need political will to pass a serious jobs bill.\n\nThis week, we\u2019re announcing the creation of the Full Employment Caucus in Congress. As co-founders, we will regularly host expert economists and policymakers to discuss proven job-creation proposals and implement strategies for their adoption.\n\nAchieving full employment isn\u2019t only about helping jobless people. When we return to full employment, investors and businesspeople have more customers. When we return to full employment, workers have power to bargain for higher wages. Finally, when we return to full employment, crime declines as desperate people gain a paycheck and a purpose.\n\nWe\u2019re founding this caucus to strength America\u2019s economy and restore dignity for the tens of millions of Americans who have suffered the physical and emotional pain of joblessness.\n\nBoth President Obama\u2019s State of the Union address and the Republican response echoed FDR\u2019s emphasis 70 years ago on expanding economic opportunity, creating jobs and boosting wages. It\u2019s time for Congress to pass a comprehensive jobs bill to realize that vision.\n\nConyers has represented congressional districts in the Detroit area of Michigan since 1965.
