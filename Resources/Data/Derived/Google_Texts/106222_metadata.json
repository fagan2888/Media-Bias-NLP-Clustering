Xcel, too, has Colorado-based customer service, but those employees are focused on corporate accounts rather than general consumers. Here, some customer-service agents share their insights and experiences.\n\nJohn O\u2019Day\n\nCompany: Comcast\n\nWhere he lives: Colorado Springs\n\nWhere he works: Colorado Springs\n\nYears on the job: One\n\nAge: 31\n\nTip for callers: I just want the customers to be aware of the many platforms we can be addressed on. You can go online \u2014 it\u2019s basically for the do-it-yourself generation \u2014 at comcast.customer.com. We do also have applications for Android or an iPhone.\n\nMemorable recent call: A female had called in and she was just very frustrated that a representative had set up an appointment for a tech to come out, and the technician didn\u2019t make it. It happens from time to time. I talked to her about that, and she voiced some concerns and wanted to leave and I said, \u201cLet me do something for you.\u201d I got her rescheduled, got her credited for the missed appointment. She just wanted to be heard out.\n\nJoanna Green\n\nCompany: Frontier Airlines\n\nWhere she lives: Denver\n\nWhere she works: Denver\n\nYears on the job: About 1.5\n\nAge: 24\n\nTip for callers: If (callers) have the information at hand, that does help. Their flight, reservation, the credit card they used for the purchase, that would help.\n\nHow many calls she fields in a day: It can vary, depending on what the weather\u2019s like, 50 or 70 \u2026 if there\u2019s weather, sometimes we get more.\n\nTrac\u00e9 Killam\n\nCompany: Frontier Airlines\n\nWhere she lives: Commerce City\n\nWhere she works: Denver\n\nYears on the job: About 1.5\n\nAge: 56\n\nTip for callers: We have what is an IDR system, so when they call in, they get an automated voice. And if they can take the time to listen to the choices, then we see it when it comes in. If they can really take the time to answer some of the questions, it does pop in all of the information that we look for.\n\nMemorable call: When I started, I had a mother of an 18-year-old call in, and the 18-year-old was on our flight from St. Louis to DIA and she had her brand-new infant baby on with her. There was a tragedy in her family and the mother wanted to get to her 18-year-old before she got onto her cellphone.\n\nI was amazed. I called my help desk. The help desk immediately called the (staff at the airport) and they go a hold of the flight crew, and the flight crew was able to escort this 18-year-old off the flight before she was able to check messages on her phone. We got the mother and the father of the 18-year-old gate passes.\n\nBrenda Schwartz\n\nCompany: Frontier Airlines\n\nWhere she lives: Southeast Aurora\n\nWhere she works: Denver\n\nYears on the job: 11.5 years\n\nAge: 49\n\nTip for callers: Right now, it\u2019s pretty much booking on our website at flyfrontier.com. Going through our website, you get all of the e-mails and the flight alerts.\n\nDave Burdick: 303-954-1957, dburdick@denverpost.com, twitter.com/daveburdick", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Customer service: Get to know some call-center employees", "title": "Customer service: Get to know some call-center employees", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/09/15/customer-service-get-to-know-some-call-center-employees/", "image": {"width": 398, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130913__20130916_C1_FE16SMMINIBIOSp2.jpg", "height": 600}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130913__20130916_C1_FE16SMMINIBIOSp2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-16T01:47:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T10:40:18+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd21bf\"", "article_summary": "Xcel, too, has Colorado-based customer service, but those employees are focused on corporate accounts rather than general consumers.\nThere was a tragedy in her family and the mother wanted to get to her 18-year-old before she got onto her cellphone.\nHere to helpComcast and Frontier both have Colorado-based customer service centers.\nAnd if they can take the time to listen to the choices, then we see it when it comes in.\nJoanna GreenCompany: Frontier AirlinesWhere she lives: DenverWhere she works: DenverYears on the job: About 1.5Age: 24Tip for callers: If (callers) have the information at hand, that does help."}
