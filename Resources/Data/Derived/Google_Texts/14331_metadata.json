Nancy Pelosi spoke lyrically about how Obamacare subsidies will allow people to leave unfulfilling jobs to pursue their passions: \u201cThink of an economy where people could be an artist or a photographer or a writer without worrying about keeping their day job in order to have health insurance.\u201d\n\nNothing so lyrical has been written about work since Marx (in \u201cThe German Ideology\u201d) described a communist society that \u201cmakes it possible for me to . . . hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, rear cattle in the evening, criticize after dinner.\u201d\n\nPelosi\u2019s vision is equally idyllic except for one thing: The taxes of the American factory worker \u2014 grinding away dutifully at his repetitive mind-numbing job \u2014 will be subsidizing the voluntary unemployment of the artiste in search of his muse. A rather paradoxical position for the party that poses as tribune of the working man.\n\n1 of 25 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 The Right\u2019s 25 most influential, from Townhall.com View Photos The conservative Web site\u2019s latest listing of the most prominent voices on the right, with a few names you may not know.

Why, Obamacare creates the \u201copportunity\u201d that \u201callows families in America to make a decision about how they will work, and if they will work.\u201d\n\nIf they will work? Pre-Obama, people always had the right to quit work to tend full time to the study of butterflies. It\u2019s a free country. The twist in the new liberal dispensation is that the butterfly guy is to be subsidized by the taxes of people who actually work.\n\nIn the traditional opportunity society, government provides the tools \u2014 education, training and various incentives \u2014 to achieve the dignity of work and its promise of self-improvement and social mobility. In the new opportunity society, you are given the opportunity for idleness while living parasitically off everyone else. Why those everyone elses should remain at their jobs \u2014 hey! I wanna dance, too! \u2014 is a puzzle Carney has yet to explain.\n\nThe honest liberal reply to the CBO report is that a disincentive to work is inherent in any means-tested government benefit. It\u2019s the unavoidable price of helping those in need because for every new dollar you earn, you lose part of your subsidy and thus keep less and less of your nominal income.\n\nThat\u2019s inevitable. And that\u2019s why we have learned to tie welfare, for example, to a work requirement. Otherwise, beneficiaries could choose to live off the dole forever. That\u2019s why the 1996 Gingrich-Clinton welfare reform succeeded in reducing welfare rolls by two-thirds. It is not surprising that the same Obama administration that has been weakening the work requirement for welfare is welcoming the disincentive to work inherent in Obamacare.\n\nBut Obamacare\u2019s war on jobs goes beyond voluntary idleness. The administration is now conceding, inadvertently but unmistakably, Obamacare\u2019s other effect \u2014 involuntary job loss. On Monday, the administration unilaterally postponed and weakened the employer mandate, already suspended through 2015, for yet another year.\n\nBut doesn\u2019t this undermine the whole idea of universal health coverage? Of course it does, but Obamacare was so structured that it is crushing small business and killing jobs. It creates a major incentive for small businesses to cut back to under 50 employees to avoid the mandate. Your business becomes a 49er by either firing workers or reducing their hours to below 30 a week. Because that doesn\u2019t count as full time, you escape both the employer mandate to buy health insurance and the fine for not doing so.\n\nWith the weakest recovery since World War II, historically high chronic unemployment and a shockingly low workforce participation rate, the administration correctly fears the economic consequences of its own law \u2014 and of the political fallout for Democrats as millions more Americans lose their jobs or are involuntarily reduced to part-time status.\n\nConservatives have been warning about this for five years. This is not rocket science. Both the voluntary and forced job losses were utterly predictable. Pelosi insisted we would have to pass the law to know what\u2019s in it. Now we know.\n\nRead more from Charles Krauthammer\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The health-care law encourages idleness and depresses hiring.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Charles-Krauthammer/95978776589", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The health-care law encourages idleness and depresses hiring.", "title": "Charles Krauthammer: Obamacare\u2019s war on jobs", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/charles-krauthammer-obamacares-war-on-jobs/2014/02/13/ed97c9c8-94eb-11e3-84e1-27626c5ef5fb_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/WashingtonPost/Content/Blogs/Images/201402/obamacare-300x199.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@krauthammer"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/charles-krauthammer-obamacares-war-on-jobs/2014/02/13/ed97c9c8-94eb-11e3-84e1-27626c5ef5fb_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "charles krauthammer, obamacare, affordable care act, nancy pelosi, welfare to work, congressional budget office, cbo jobs, obamacare jobs", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Charles-Krauthammer/95978776589"}, "eomportal-uuid": "ed97c9c8-94eb-11e3-84e1-27626c5ef5fb", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "charles krauthammer, obamacare, affordable care act, nancy pelosi, welfare to work, congressional budget office, cbo jobs, obamacare jobs"}, "article_summary": "In the new opportunity society, you are given the opportunity for idleness while living parasitically off everyone else.\nBut Obamacare\u2019s war on jobs goes beyond voluntary idleness.\nDemocratic talking points gamely defend this as a good thing because these jobs are being given up voluntarily.\nRead more from Charles Krauthammer\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.\nIn the traditional opportunity society, government provides the tools \u2014 education, training and various incentives \u2014 to achieve the dignity of work and its promise of self-improvement and social mobility."}
