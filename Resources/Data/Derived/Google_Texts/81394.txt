From concerts to weddings, American taxpayers are often billed for heinously expensive and unnecessary things. Such scandals only make the larger news outlets when they involve politicians in national offices, but that doesn’t mean it never happens on a local scale.

Consider this report from Sacramento, Cali., where state records obtained by a local newspaper indicate that the California Senate hired what amounts to a private, 24-hour taxi service for intoxicated state officials. All of this, of course, was paid for by the California taxpayers:

The employees are paid $2,532 per month, the Sacramento Bee reported. The service comes after high-profile arrests of lawmakers on suspicion of drunken driving. Four lawmakers in the last five years have been accused of drunk driving, including three on streets around the Capitol.

No official comments were made when the paper made inquiries with the office of Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de León (D-Los Angeles). Meanwhile, an official spokesperson declined to comment “because it’s a security issue.”

According to a man who turned down the job and an unnamed legislative chief, the service was meant “to be used in an emergency” only. Whether or not this is actually the case remains unknown, as no official comments have been made about the taxi service since the investigation went public.
