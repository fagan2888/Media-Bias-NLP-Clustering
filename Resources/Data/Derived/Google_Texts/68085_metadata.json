But, as of yesterday, they do have a memo, which may one day become a plan, which may one day become an \u201cObamacare\u201d rival.\n\nAnd if that sounds silly, that\u2019s because it is. The Huffington Post reported yesterday:\n\nIt took President Barack Obama and the Democratic Congress 14 months to pass the Affordable Care Act in 2009 and 2010. In about five times as many months, congressional Republicans have produced the following: a set of warmed-over talking points that fits on less than two printed pages. Yes, it\u2019s true. More than seven years into Obama\u2019s presidency \u2013 an era during which health care reform has been one of the defining issues in domestic politics \u2013 a group of GOP lawmakers hand-picked by House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) released a \u201cmission statement\u201d on Thursday. It is 251 words long.\n\nThis isn\u2019t an exaggeration. The House Republicans\u2019 Task Force on Health Care Reform released a formal memo yesterday with a \u201cmission statement,\u201d which is roughly half the length of the blog post you\u2019re now reading, and which is followed by a series of vague goals that appear to have no substantive meaning whatsoever.\n\nAmericans will be delighted to learn, for example, that the GOP task force intends to one day have a policy that will \u201cempower every American with the ability to gain access to coverage that is affordable and portable.\u201d Republicans, once they have a plan, also want to \u201cprotect the quality of care for all patients \u2013 including those with pre-existing conditions.\u201d\n\nTo achieve these goals, the party\u2019s task force intends to explore \u201cinnovations in employer-provided health care coverage,\u201d while \u201creforming broken insurance markets.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t want to hurt anyone\u2019s feelings, and I\u2019m sure a small army of Republican staffers on the Hill worked very hard to come up with a brief document filled with meaningless platitudes, but GOP officials have been working on a health care plan for more than six years. As a result of these efforts, Republicans have come up with a policy-free memo?\n\nMarco Rubio blasted Donald Trump last night for not having a substantive health care policy, which was both true and fair. But maybe it\u2019s time to also appreciate the fact that congressional Republicans don\u2019t have a substantive health care policy either, and unlike Trump, they\u2019ve been trying to come up with one since 2009.\n\nlast month why he was moving forward with a bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act before the Republican alternative is ready.
