In the week prior to the wedding, I attempted to postpone the wedding several times until I completed counseling, but I still went through with it. I now realize that was a mistake.\u201d\n\nJohnson\u2019s agent, D.J. Fisher, said in a statement that Johnson-Griner was unaware of the filing and was \u201cextremely hurt and blindsided\u201d by Griner\u2019s actions.\n\n\u201cShe loves Brittney and made a huge sacrifice to carry a child, put her career on hold, invest in their relationship and their future,\u201d Fisher said.\n\nGriner, the 6-foot-8 Phoenix Mercury star, married Johnson-Griner on May 9, three weeks after they were arrested on domestic violence charges for a fight at their home in suburban Phoenix. Both players were suspended seven games after their arrests and Griner agreed to undergo 26 weeks of domestic violence counseling as part of a plea agreement.\n\nBoth players apologized and said they worked out their differences, saying they were happy about the marriage. Johnson-Griner, a two-time All-Star with the Tulsa Shock, announced on Instagram on Thursday that she was pregnant and would miss the WNBA season.\n\nFisher said Johnson-Griner was in it for the long haul.\n\n\u201cShe knows how important marriage is, and made a lifetime commitment and decision to spend the rest of her life with Brittney,\u201d Fisher said.\n\nEarlier Friday, a post on Johnson-Griner\u2019s Instagram account showed a photo of Griner and a message about seeing her again: \u201cOne day until I\u2019m reunited with my Wife @brittneygriner . . . This is about to be one CRAZY SUMMER!!!\u201d\n\nHer tune changed later in the day.\n\n\u201cShe wishes to ask for privacy at this time as they work through these trials and tribulations,\u201d Fisher said. \u201cShe asks her fans for all their love, support and prayers during this trying time.\u201d\n\nJohnson-Griner\u2019s suspension will not start until the 2016 season because she will not play this season.\n\nGriner was the WNBA\u2019s defensive player of the year and helped the Mercury win the league championship last season.\n\nThe WNBA season started Friday night.\n\nThis story has been corrected to remove a reference to Griner appealing her suspension.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Brittney Griner files to annul marriage to fellow WNBA player", "title": "Brittney Griner files to annul marriage to fellow WNBA player", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/06/06/brittney-griner-files-to-annul-marriage-to-fellow-wnba-player/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150606_013113_brittney-griner.jpg", "height": 509}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150606_013113_brittney-griner.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-06T13:32:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T22:54:46+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cLast Wednesday, Glory and I agreed to either legally separate, get divorced, or annul our marriage, Griner said in a statement.\nOKLAHOMA CITY \u2014 Brittney Griner filed for an annulment with Glory Johnson-Griner on Friday, a day after Johnson-Griner announced she\u2019s pregnant and a month after the two WNBA players married.\n\u201cShe knows how important marriage is, and made a lifetime commitment and decision to spend the rest of her life with Brittney,\u201d Fisher said.\nGriner was the WNBA\u2019s defensive player of the year and helped the Mercury win the league championship last season.\nFisher, said in a statement that Johnson-Griner was unaware of the filing and was \u201cextremely hurt and blindsided\u201d by Griner\u2019s actions."}
