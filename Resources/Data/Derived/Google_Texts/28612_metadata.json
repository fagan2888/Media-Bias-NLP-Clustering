(Pete Souza/The White House)\n\nFor a long time, presidential humor was predictable as a knock-knock joke. Then along came President Obama, dropping the word \u201cheezy,\u201d mimicking viral memes, and quipping that he and Joe Biden are so close, they\u2019d probably be denied service at an Indiana pizza joint.\n\nObama, who will take the stage at the annual White House Correspondents\u2019 Association Dinner on Saturday to deliver the traditional joke-filled monologue \u2014 the eighth and final of his administration \u2014 has a comic sensibility that\u2019s edgier and more pop-culture-influenced than we\u2019re used to hearing from politicians.\n\nFrom the dinner dais, he\u2019s made reference to drunk-texting and \u201cThe Hunger Games.\u201d He\u2019s used the phrase \u201cpiss off\u201d and flirted with even bluer material. (Does he have a bucket list for his final year? \u201cWell,\u201d he quipped at the 2015 dinner, \u201cI have something that rhymes with bucket list.\u201d) Outside the dinner, he\u2019s mocked the New York Times food section on Twitter (\u201crespect the nyt, but not buying peas in guac\u201d) and sparred with Zach Galifianakis on his culty \u201cBetween Two Ferns\u201d faux-talk show.\n\nHe might not be the first truly post-racial president after all \u2014 but Obama is arguably the first postmodern humorist to hold the office.\n\n[President Obama\u2019s 10 most hilarious lines from the White House correspondents\u2019 dinners]\n\nGeorge W. Bush and Bill Clinton both possessed easy senses of humor and could deliver a punchline. But Obama\u2019s style, comedy writers say, belongs to the alternative comedy subgenre \u2014 a style of humor that breaks with traditional stand-up, loosely defined by irony, self-awareness, and quirky topical references. Think more Sarah Silverman and less Henny Youngman.\n\nPresident Obama will make his final remarks at this year's White House Correspondents' Association dinner April 30. Here's a look back at some of his funniest moments. (Victoria Walker/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not into the classic hokey punchlines,\u201d said Brian Agler, a comedian and speechwriter at the Washington-based West Wing Writers. \u201cThere\u2019s a level of detachment and a level of understanding about what\u2019s going on, like, \u2018this is kind of weird that the president is up here in a tux making jokes\u2019 \u2014 all of his humor has that element baked into it.\u201d\n\nTake this bit from his 2011 White House Correspondents\u2019 Association dinner performance poking fun at the \u201cbirthers\u201d who, against all evidence, allege that Obama was actually born in Kenya \u2014 among them Donald Trump, who sat in the audience that night. After promising the room that he was about to reveal his \u201cbirth video,\u201d he rolled a clip from the African-set cartoon movie \u201cThe Lion King.\u201d\n\nWhich might have been funny enough on its own. The crowd roared. But Obama added a deadpan flourish.\n\n\u201cThat was a joke,\u201d he intoned, pausing for effect. \u201cThat was not my real birth video. That was a children\u2019s cartoon.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what humorists call a \u201cmeta\u201d moment: It\u2019s a joke about making a joke. Get it?\n\nAt last year\u2019s dinner, Obama was joined onstage by comedian Keegan-Michael Key, in character as the president\u2019s \u201canger translator,\u201d a recurring gag on his Comedy Central sketch show, \u201cKey & Peele.\u201d As Obama spoke soberly, Key acted out his unspoken and decidedly un-PC thoughts.\n\nObama, calmly: \u201cDespite our differences, we can count on the press to shed light on the most important issues of the day.\u201d\n\nKey, agitated and loud: \u201cAnd we can count on Fox News to terrify old white people with some nonsense! \u2018Sharia law is coming to Cleveland! Run for the damn hills!\u2019 \u201d\n\n[How Barack Obama and his \u2018anger translator\u2019 finally got on stage together]\n\n\n\nPresident Obama, right, with Keegan-Michael Key as his \u201canger translator\u201d at the 2015 White House Correspondents\u2019 Association dinner. (Evan Vucci/AP)\n\nThe president\u2019s reputation as a funny guy is, of course, partly courtesy of the professionally crafted material he reads off the Teleprompters. It\u2019s no secret: A team of speechwriters writes his correspondents\u2019 dinner routines for him. But Obama has input in that process, said David Litt, a former White House speechwriter who\u2019s now the head writer at the Washington office of comedy website Funny or Die.\n\nWriters consult with the president in the weeks leading up to the dinner to get a sense of the punchlines he likes \u2014 and those he doesn\u2019t. Then the boss tweaks the final version. \u201cHe would make these little, small changes, but they would make such a difference,\u201d Litt said. \u201cThey would punctuate the joke in a way that made it work better, or replace a phrase with a slightly better phrase.\u201d\n\nObama has gotten plenty of unscripted laughs, too. During last year\u2019s State of the Union address, Republicans cheered after he said he had no more elections to run. \u201cI know, because I won both of them,\u201d Obama zinged back. Those mic-dropping words didn\u2019t appear in the advance copy of his remarks.\n\nAnd as any comic will tell you, timing is everything, even when the words aren\u2019t your own. During the 2015 traditional White House ceremony in which the president pardons a turkey, Obama\u2019s remarks were standard har-har material: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe that this is my seventh year of pardoning turkeys. Time flies, even if turkeys don\u2019t.\u201d Ba-da-bum.\n\nBut his delivery \u2014 arch, cut with sarcasm \u2014 conveyed what the words might not have made clear: The president thought the entire thing was completely absurd.\n\n\n\nPresident Obama and comedian Joel McHale talk at at the 2014 dinner. (Olivier Douliery/EPA)\n\nOne stylistic tic, a student of Obama\u2019s performances might note, is his tendency to laugh at his own jokes as he\u2019s making them. Too much self-amusement is considered a no-no among comedians, but Obama, the pros say, makes it work. \u201cHe has this wry smile,\u201d Agler said. \u201cHe 100 percent knows what he\u2019s doing there.\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s own tastes in stand-up are illustrative. During a podcast interview with comedian Marc Maron, Obama professed a love for comedy, citing as favorites Richard Pryor, Dick Gregory (\u201cwhen he was on the edge\u201d), Jerry Seinfeld and Louis C.K. He described the latter as \u201cwonderful in such a self-deprecating, but edgy kind of way. And basically good-hearted even when he\u2019s saying stuff that\u2019s pretty wrong, you know?\u201d\n\nAccording to professionals, Obama has learned a few tricks from his idols.\n\n\u201cHe has great timing, and that is something you cannot fake,\u201d said Stephanie Laing, a former executive producer and director of HBO\u2019s \u201cVeep\u201d and the founder of the online women\u2019s comedy platform PYPO. \u201cHe\u2019s not goofy. It\u2019s a quiet, very sophisticated humor.\u201d\n\nNo less an expert than Seinfeld himself praised Obama\u2019s comedic skills. He included the president in his series \u201cComedians in Cars Getting Coffee,\u201d insisting that Obama is, in fact, a professional. \u201cHe\u2019s done some really good work as a monologist at those correspondents\u2019 dinners \u2014 that\u2019s how he qualifies to be on the show,\u201d Seinfeld said.\n\n[Behind the wheel of the Obama episode of Seinfeld\u2019s \u2018Comedians in Cars\u2019]\n\nObama\u2019s comfort with this kind of humor is likely one reason for the surprising number of his comedic performances. In addition to his dinner speeches, he has been a frequent guest on late-night talk shows, from \u201cLetterman\u201d to \u201cThe Daily Show,\u201d where he banters and fields questions about walking around the White House in his underwear. He\u2019s slow-jammed the news with Jimmy Fallon and read mean tweets about himself on \u201cJimmy Kimmel.\u201d\n\nBut the laughs often aren\u2019t for their own sake. Obama has used comedic venues to advance his agenda, particularly among young people who are more likely to share a viral video than watch one of his speeches.\n\nOn the \u201cBetween Two Ferns\u201d segment and in a Buzzfeed video where he brandished a selfie stick, the president encouraged young people to sign up for Obamacare health coverage. The news he slow-jammed on Fallon\u2019s show was about his student-loan initiative.\n\nObama\u2019s bone-dry comedic stylings aren\u2019t without risk. They carry the potential to come off as mean.\n\nAt the 2013 dinner, he took a jab at the Republican Senate majority leader. \u201cSome folks still don\u2019t think I spend enough time with Congress,\u201d he said. \u201d \u2018Why don\u2019t you get a drink with Mitch McConnell?\u2019 they ask. Really? Why don\u2019t you get a drink with Mitch McConnell?\u201d\n\nMcConnell later tweeted a picture of himself at a bar, enjoying a beer, with an empty barstool beside him.\n\n@BarackObama @Eastwood_ Greetings from coal country! Hazard, KY -MM pic.twitter.com/6IgV6sEL8j \u2014 Team Mitch (@Team_Mitch) April 29, 2013\n\nAnd the commander-in-chief\u2019s style can fuel the criticisms that have long dogged him \u2014 that he is snooty and detached. Which, in Obama\u2019s comedy world, is simply another opportunity to go meta.\n\n\u201cSome people say I\u2019m arrogant, aloof, condescending,\u201d the president said at last year\u2019s dinner.\n\nHe paused.\n\n\u201cSome people are so dumb.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "As he prepares for his final WHCA dinner, Obama has shown an edgier comic sensibility than most politicians.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/emilyheil", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "As he prepares for his final WHCA dinner, Obama has shown an edgier comic sensibility than most politicians.", "title": "Barack Obama, the first alt-comedy president", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/reliable-source/wp/2016/04/25/barack-obama-the-first-alt-comedy-president/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2012/11/17/Production/WashingtonPost/Images/515409328-2008.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@emilyaheil"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/reliable-source/wp/2016/04/25/barack-obama-the-first-alt-comedy-president/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "barack obama, president obama, obama, comedy, humor, alt comedy, alternative comedy, whca, whcd, white house correspondents, correspondents dinner, obama speech, obama comedy, obama jokes", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/emilyheil"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "barack obama, president obama, obama, comedy, humor, alt comedy, alternative comedy, whca, whcd, white house correspondents, correspondents dinner, obama speech, obama comedy, obama jokes"}, "article_summary": "President Obama will make his final remarks at this year's White House Correspondents' Association dinner April 30.\nPresident Obama and Olympic gymnast McKayla Maroney mimic the athlete\u2019s \u201cnot impressed\u201d look in 2012.\nThen along came President Obama, dropping the word \u201cheezy,\u201d mimicking viral memes, and quipping that he and Joe Biden are so close, they\u2019d probably be denied service at an Indiana pizza joint.\nRun for the damn hills!\u2019 \u201d[How Barack Obama and his \u2018anger translator\u2019 finally got on stage together]President Obama, right, with Keegan-Michael Key as his \u201canger translator\u201d at the 2015 White House Correspondents\u2019 Association dinner.\nPresident Obama and comedian Joel McHale talk at at the 2014 dinner."}
