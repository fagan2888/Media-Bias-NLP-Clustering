Across the region, people picnicked, ran and gathered to celebrate and share.\n\nHere\u2019s a sampling of the day from four summer interns from The Dallas Morning News who took in the sights and sounds of Independence Day in North Texas.\n\nA serviceman\u2019s surprise\n\nA Mansfield couple got a surprise while watching the Arlington\u2019s Fourth of July parade Friday morning.\n\nAs a Navy moms\u2019 float passed by, K.C. Parenteau didn\u2019t think much about it until she caught a familiar face.\n\nHer son, 23-year-old Petty Officer 2nd Class John Parenteau, dressed in his Navy whites, was staring right at her.\n\nDays earlier, the cover story had been that his leave had been cancelled. It was all a ruse, planned by the sailor\u2019s sister, Katie Saldovar.\n\nCancelled leaves are a military mainstay, she said. \u201cBecause we knew that, after he booked his flight we keep it under-wraps.\u201d\n\nParade organizers played along.\n\nParenteau has been deployed in the Persian Gulf for the last year and a half. He got home for the holiday and his July 9 birthday.\n\n\u201cIt all went off without a hitch,\u201d he said by phone from the family\u2019s home. \u201cA lot of service members don\u2019t get this opportunity. To see their faces was great.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Gregory Castillo\n\nRed, white and blue run\n\nMore than 500 running fanatics woke up early for the first 4K/7K Fourth of July run through Fair Park. Not only did they bring their A-game, but many donned their red, white and blue best.\n\nPatriotic tutus, knee socks and leg warmers were common. But nothing quite came close to the outfit of Robert Fuentes of Fort Worth.\n\nAt first glance, Fuentes was Captain America \u2013 but a closer look revealed a fan of Clint Dempsey, captain of the U.S. soccer team.\n\n\u201cIf Captain America came to a race, who would he dress as?\u201d asked Fuentes, 54, as he pulled out a paper cutout mask of the Team USA captain\u2019s face. \u201cDempsey.\u201d\n\nAll proceeds from the event will go to the Park and Recreation Department\u2019s eight-week summer camp for kids. City Council member Adam Medrano, a former parks and rec employee, ran to support the program and for another reason.\n\n\u201cYou know you\u2019re gonna be eating bad, so better come out here and exercise,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2013 Danielle Grobmeier\n\nBallpark sleepover\n\nFor Jay Johnson and his kids Everett, 6, and Ainsley, 8, the Fourth of July means baseball \u2014 even if no game was actually being played.\n\nWith the Texas Rangers on the road, fans hit the Globe Life Park outfield in droves for the team\u2019s annual sleepover Thursday night to Friday morning.\n\nArmed with blankets, pillows, sleeping mats and sleeping bags, families cheered for their home team, watching the Rangers play in Baltimore on the jumbotron (Orioles 5, Rangers 2).\n\nIt was a game-like atmosphere for the youngsters, with mascots tossing balls, shirts and even a fireworks display at 10 p.m.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing like baseball around this time,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cWe\u2019ve been regulars since we moved here six years ago, tonight it\u2019s like we\u2019re camping out with a few hundred of our closest Rangers\u2019 fans.\u201d\n\nAptly named fans Nolan and Ryan Rice, 8 and 4 respectively, and their dad Chase spent the night camped out on the field. According to Chase, the kids found the grass soft (but not soft enough for mom to join the fun.) The boys would do it all over if they could, even though little Ryan was scarred of the fireworks finale.\n\nFor Steve Johnson, 41, of Fort Worth and his boys Nicholas, 7, and Nathaniel, 3, the warm night wasn\u2019t anything they couldn\u2019t take. They went camping last week, so they were accustomed to a little heat and humidity.\n\n\u201cI could sleep on anything,\u201d said Nicholas. \u201cIf I had to sleep on this concrete wall, I probably could.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Gregory Castillo\n\nParade finery\n\nZoie Powers, 12, wore red, white and blue from head to toe. Her big toes, in fact, were painted with American flags.\n\nZoie rode in the back of a white truck for the Little Forest Hills\u2019 Fourth of July Parade in East Dallas. The truck had dozens of birthday balloons springing from it, along with a sign: \u201cHappy 238th Birthday, America.\u201d\n\nThe parade picked up neighbors as it wove through the blocks. They biked, skated and pushed wagons behind cars and trucks to Casa Linda Park, where watermelon and apple pie waited.\n\nZoie wore a red and white skirt she sewed with her mom. She put it on over a blue sequined dress.\n\n\u201cI look very overdressed compared to everyone else,\u201d she said.\n\nIt would take a lot to outdo everyone: she was joined by Captain America and Uncle Sam \u2014 even a dog wearing a red tutu.\n\nFor Suzy McHenry, whose 5-year-old son Newman was Captain America, the parade showed what she loved about the neighborhood.\n\n\u201cLittle Forest Hills is Little Forest Hills,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re all oddballs.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Masako Melissa Hirsch\n\nWatching the parade\n\nDave May, 72, of Plano, used to march in Independence Day parades; now he watches. He and his wife Marchetta were at the 34th annual Plano Lions Independence Day Parade.\n\nIn America-themed T-shirts, the Plano residents of four decades shared memories as they watched politicians and floats pass by. Occasionally, Dave May shouted out a familiar participant\u2019s name.\n\nHe likened one float, a large green tractor, to a \u201csign of Plano past.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis all used to be farmland,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter the last float rolled by, the Mays folded up their picnic chairs and headed home. They\u2019ll be back next year, they said.\n\n\u2013 Naheed Rajwani\n\nPatriotic pool party\n\nNestled between a group of houses and a patch of trees is a pool.\n\nParked cars snake around the entrance. Chatter and the faint smell of barbecue envelopes the area off Springbrook drive in Plano.\n\nThis, however, is not an ordinary pool. As its staff says, it\u2019s a \u201cTexas-sized, Texas-shaped pool.\u201d\n\nAnd on days such as The Fourth of July, the 168,000-gallon Texas Poolis free to the public.\n\nPlano resident Dawn Hall sits in a pool chair under a large tree with a laptop in her lap and a 1,700-page surgical nursing textbook to her left.\n\nShe\u2019s trying to finish an assignment for nursing school before jumping into the pool. Her 13-year-old daughter is already inside and her 18-year-old son is on lifeguard duty.\n\n\u201cFor me, sitting here makes it less like I\u2019m studying. The noise doesn\u2019t bother me,\u201d said Hall, whose family has come to the pool for 12 years.\n\nSome people, including Grapevine resident Laura Hoke, are first-time visitors.\n\nHoke, who\u2019s wearing her special \u201cAmerica suit\u201d for the occasion, straps a gray shark-themed floatie on her 4-year-old son.\n\nHe wobbles toward a diving board off the pool\u2019s panhandle.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a lot of fun. They seem to be enjoying it,\u201d Laura Hoke says, as her son dives into Texas.\n\nSplash.\n\n\u2013 Naheed Rajwani\n\nIndependence on the fourth\n\nCharlie Hilton had on his cowboy boots at lunch at the Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 6796 in Dallas. He was ready for the dance band later in the afternoon.\n\n\u201cI might not make half, but I\u2019m going to try,\u201d Hilton said.\n\nHilton, 86, has come to the VFW for over 20 years. As a World War II veteran who served two years in the South Pacific and Guam, met with fellow veterans through the group. \u201cThis is the place for us,\u201d he said.\n\nHilton and his wife Dee have attended dances, bingo nights and other VFW events. They\u2019ve lost older friends. Friday, however, every seat at their table was full.\n\nFor Hilton, the gathering came down to one thing: \u201cIt\u2019s Independence Day. And we\u2019re independent \u2014 at least I am.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Masako Melissa Hirsch\n\nStaff Writer Randy Lee Loftis contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDE0LzA3L2Rmdy1mb3VydGgtb2YtanVseS1zdGFydHMtb2ZmLXdpdGgtYS1zbGVlcG92ZXItYW5kLWEtcnVuLmh0bWwv", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Mede Nix", "og": {"site_name": "The Scoop Blog", "description": "A Navy mom\u2019s joy, a kid\u2019s baseball fantasy and a veteran\u2019s remembrance were all part of Independence Day in North Texas.
