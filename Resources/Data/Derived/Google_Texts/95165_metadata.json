Sarah Palin (R), avoiding another government shutdown makes Republican lawmakers comparable to domestic abusers, The Hill reported.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t hide the black eyes any more. The whole neighborhood knows,\u201d Palin wrote in an op-ed for Breitbart.com published on Saturday. \u201cThe Democrats are gloating. Obama thanked Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) effusively \u2014 and why shouldn\u2019t he? Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) couldn\u2019t have given him more.\u201d\n\nThe former vice-presidential candidate was upset that Ryan and his fellow House Republicans backed a $1.1 trillion spending bill that will keep the government operational through September 2016 without blocking federal funding for either Planned Parenthood or the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare. To Palin, that constituted another broken promise from non-Tea Party GOP legislators.\n\n\u201cThey did it again. But like a battered wife, we keep going back because every four years they bring us flowers, beg our forgiveness, and swear they\u2019ll never hit us again,\u201d she stated.\n\nPalin also criticized the House Freedom Caucus, the group of conservative lawmakers who vocally opposed former House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH), saying that they gave Ryan a pass.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re lucky, maybe they\u2019ll call 911 for us when the beating starts up again,\u201d she wrote.\n\nHowever, she added, her supporters should not abandon the GOP.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to kick our abusers out of the House, change the locks, and keep a loaded shotgun next to the bed,\u201d she wrote.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Sarah_Palin_Facebook-800x430.png", "height": 430}, "title": "Sarah Palin compares Republicans to wife-beaters for reaching federal spending deal"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "article_summary": "Sarah Palin (R), avoiding another government shutdown makes Republican lawmakers comparable to domestic abusers, The Hill reported.\nThe whole neighborhood knows,\u201d Palin wrote in an op-ed for Breitbart.com published on Saturday.\nSarah Palin (Facebook)According to ex-Alaska Gov.\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to kick our abusers out of the House, change the locks, and keep a loaded shotgun next to the bed,\u201d she wrote.\nPalin also criticized the House Freedom Caucus, the group of conservative lawmakers who vocally opposed former House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH), saying that they gave Ryan a pass."}
