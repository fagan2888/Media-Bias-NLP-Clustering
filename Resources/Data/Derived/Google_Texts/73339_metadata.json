Forty-eight percent said that the money they earn driving for Uber is not a \u201csignificant source of personal income.\u201d That\u2019s up from 38 percent in 2014.\n\nThe number of drivers who said that Uber represented their only source of personal income also fell 4 percent from last year.\n\nThe findings lend credence to recent company arguments as a debate rages over whether it should classify its workers, currently labeled independent contractors, as employees who would get access to benefits and other protections.\n\n\u201cPeople are using Uber who are struggling to pay bills, who are looking to earn a little extra spending money or are transitioning between jobs,\u201d Uber executive and former Obama campaign manager David Plouffe said during a November speech in Washington.\n\nThe relationship that the workers have with Uber is a crucial part of the debate over the drivers\u2019 classification. Under the law, the degree of control that an employer has over workers' lives weighs heavily on whether that worker is considered an employee.\n\nSome politicians have expressed concerns about the rise of companies, like Uber, that comprise the on-demand economy. Sen. Mark Warner Mark WarnerArmy posthumously awards female veteran who served as WWII spy The Hill's 12:30 Report Clinton urged to go liberal with vice presidential pick MORE (D-Va.), for example, has called for legislation to create a safety net for the workers.\n\nUber is also fighting a class-action lawsuit filed by drivers in California who say that they are employees. It is expected to be argued in June.\n\nResearchers conducted interviews with 833 Uber drivers for the study, which has a margin of error of 3.4 percent.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The Uber-sponsored survey supports the company's arguments in classification debate.", "description": "The Uber-sponsored survey supports the company's arguments in classification debate.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "David McCabe", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The Uber-sponsored survey supports the company's arguments in classification debate.", "title": "Uber says more drivers holding other jobs", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/262298-uber-says-more-working-for-company-on-the-side", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/uber_082015gn.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-01T06:17:42-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-01T06:17-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/262298-uber-says-more-working-for-company-on-the-side", "dcterms.date": "2015-12-07T11:02-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "David McCabe", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "on-demand economy,Mark Warner,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-07T11:02:40-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-01T06:17:42-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/262298-uber-says-more-working-for-company-on-the-side", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The Uber-sponsored survey supports the company's arguments in classification debate.", "card": "summary", "title": "Uber says more drivers holding other jobs"}, "dcterms.title": "Uber says more drivers holding other jobs"}, "article_summary": "Researchers conducted interviews with 833 Uber drivers for the study, which has a margin of error of 3.4 percent.\nUber says an increasing number of its drivers are working for the car-sharing service while holding other jobs.\nThe number of drivers who said that Uber represented their only source of personal income also fell 4 percent from last year.\nADVERTISEMENTAlmost half of drivers also said they consider the income they earn from Uber supplemental.\nThe relationship that the workers have with Uber is a crucial part of the debate over the drivers\u2019 classification."}
