Cross Country Healthcare, which already employs about 500 people in Boca Raton, is leasing new office space there and plans to hire up to 100 new workers over the next two years, the company said.

The new office, where the company will lease 36,000 square feet, will be at 5201 Congress Road.

Cross Country said it also will continue to lease 70,406 square feet for its national headquarters at 6551 Park of Commerce in Boca Raton, but would reduce its office space at 901 Yamato Road.

Cross Country Healthcare provides physician staffing, travel nurses and other professionals for than 3,000 health care operations in the U.S. and Caribbean.

Beginning in 2014 with the Affordable Care Act, the company has seen greater demand for its recruiting services, said William Burns, Cross Country's chief financial officer. "We're expanding offices to support our growth," he said.

Cross Country reported $617.83 million in revenue for fiscal 2014, up from $438.31 million in 2013.

He said Cross Country's nurse and allied health staffing operation, managed in Boca Raton, provides 80 percent of the company's revenue. In 2014, Cross Country also completed its $48 million acquisition of Medical Staffing Network, which had 55 locations across the country.

Locally, the company is seeking health care recruiters, billing and payroll workers, human resources specialists and information technology workers, Burns said.

The company hasn't applied for any state or local economic incentives related to its job creation, Burns said. Cross Country also has major operations in Atlanta and St. Louis.
