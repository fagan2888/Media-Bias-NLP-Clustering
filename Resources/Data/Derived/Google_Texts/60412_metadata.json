As parents gear up to fork over $20,000 to $60,000 for college tuition, they might benefit from knowing what greets their youngsters. Deceitful college officials, who visit high schools to recruit students and talk to parents, conceal the worst of their campus practices. Let\u2019s expose some of it.\n\nChristina Hoff Sommers is an avowed feminist and a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. She\u2019s spent a lifetime visiting college campuses. Recently, upon her arrival at Oberlin College, Georgetown University and other campuses, trigger warnings were issued asserting, in her words, that her \u201cvery presence on campus\u201d was \u201ca form of violence\u201d and that she was threatening students\u2019 mental health. At Oberlin, 30 students and the campus therapy dog retired to a \u201csafe room\u201d with soft music, crayons and coloring books to escape any uncomfortable facts raised by Sommers.\n\nThe problem for students and some professors is that Sommers challenges the narrative, with credible statistical facts, that women are living in a violent, paternalistic rape culture. As a result, she has been \u201cexcommunicated from the church of campus feminism\u201d in order to protect women from her uncomfortable facts. This prompted Sommers to say, \u201cThere\u2019s a move to get young women in combat, and yet on our campuses, they are so fragile they can\u2019t handle a speaker with dissenting views.\u201d I wonder whether there will be demands for the military to have therapy dogs and safe rooms in combat situations.\n\nThe University of New Hampshire published a \u201cBias-Free Language Guide,\u201d which \u201cis meant to invite inclusive excellence in (the) campus community.\u201d Terms such as \u201cAmerican,\u201d \u201chomosexual,\u201d \u201cillegal alien,\u201d \u201cCaucasian,\u201d \u201cmothering,\u201d \u201cfathering\u201d and \u201cforeigners\u201d are deemed \u201cproblematic.\u201d Other problematic terms include \u201celders,\u201d \u201csenior citizen,\u201d \u201coverweight,\u201d \u201cspeech impediment,\u201d \u201cdumb,\u201d \u201csexual preference,\u201d \u201cmanpower,\u201d \u201cfreshmen,\u201d \u201cmailman\u201d and \u201cchairman.\u201d For now, these terms are seen as problematic. If the political correctness police were permitted to get away with it, later they would bring disciplinary action against a student or faculty member who used the terms. The offender would be required to attend diversity training, the leftist equivalent of communist re-education camps. In a rare instance of administrative guts, UNH President Mark Huddleston said he is offended by many things in the guide and declared that it is not university policy.\n\nFlorida State University has an \u201cEqual Opportunity and Non-Discrimination Statement,\u201d which says, \u201cBehavior that may be considered offensive, demeaning, or degrading to persons or groups will not be tolerated.\u201d That\u2019s both broad and troublesome. Say that you\u2019re a Muslim student and offended by homosexuality. Can you demand termination of campus activities that support homosexual activities?\n\nA 2014 report by the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (http://tinyurl.com/mjvn4kl) found that 59 percent of the 427 higher-education institutions it analyzed have policies that infringe on First Amendment rights. FIRE found that the University of Connecticut prohibits \u201cactions that intimidate, humiliate, or demean persons or groups, or that undermine their security or self-esteem.\u201d The University of South Carolina prohibits \u201cteasing,\u201d \u201cridiculing\u201d and \u201cinsulting.\u201d\n\nIn 2012, FIRE listed the \u201c12 Worst Colleges for Free Speech\u201d (http://tinyurl.com/o94rour). In no particular order, they are the University of Cincinnati, Syracuse University, Widener University, Harvard University, Yale University, Saint Augustine\u2019s College, Michigan State University, Colorado College, Johns Hopkins University, Tufts University, Bucknell University and Brandeis University.\n\nUniversity presidents, other academic administrators and faculty members all too often find the well-worn path of least resistance most attractive. They give support to claims of oppression and victimhood. These close-minded people are simply the \u201cgrown-up\u201d leftist hippie generation of the 1960s and \u201870s.\n\nYou might ask: What\u2019s Walter Williams\u2019 solution to these problems? For starters, benefactors should stop giving money to universities that endorse anti-free speech and racist diversity policy. Simply go to a university\u2019s website. If you find an office of diversity, close your pocketbook. There\u2019s nothing like the sound of pocketbooks snapping shut to open the closed minds of administrators.\n\nWalter E. Williams is a professor of economics at George Mason University.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://fondul.ac/1LjoaPV", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "At Oberlin, 30 students and the campus therapy dog retired to a \u201csafe room\u201d with soft music", "og": {"site_name": "Action Reporter Media", "description": "At Oberlin, 30 students and the campus therapy dog retired to a \u201csafe room\u201d with soft music", "title": "\u2018Trigger warnings,\u2019 other habits stifling free speech", "url": "http://www.fdlreporter.com/story/opinion/2015/08/18/trigger-warnings-practices-stifling-free-speech/31931085/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/fdlreporter.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "At Oberlin, 30 students and the campus therapy dog retired to a \u201csafe room\u201d with soft music", "title": "\u2018Trigger warnings,\u2019 other habits stifling free speech", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/311acef452c761248626f1084c753f997d36cd6b/c=882-0-4314-3432&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/08/18/FondduLac/B9318501921Z.1_20150818154926_000_GU7BLN7A1.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@fdlreporter", "site": "@fdlreporter", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=884281456", "fb": {"app_id": 175275349169565}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdce1d\"", "article_summary": "In no particular order, they are the University of Cincinnati, Syracuse University, Widener University, Harvard University, Yale University, Saint Augustine\u2019s College, Michigan State University, Colorado College, Johns Hopkins University, Tufts University, Bucknell University and Brandeis University.\n(Photo: Eli Baylis/Hattiesburg American)Last week\u2019s column highlighted college campus absurdities and the ongoing attack on free speech and plain common sense.\nFreshman students participate in a campus tour during Golden Eagle Welcome Week at The University of Southern Mississippi Monday.\nDeceitful college officials, who visit high schools to recruit students and talk to parents, conceal the worst of their campus practices.\nFor starters, benefactors should stop giving money to universities that endorse anti-free speech and racist diversity policy."}
