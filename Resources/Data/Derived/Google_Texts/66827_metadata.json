It\u2019s sore again and the reliever has yet to pitch in a Cactus League game.\n\nLogan, who signed a three-year, $16.5 million deal with the Rockies before the 2014 season, said he \u201cgot a little quick, a little too soon\u201d when spring training opened.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing major,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just takes a little longer to get going than it did back in the day.\n\nLogan, 31, has had trouble with his elbow since having bone chips and a bone spur removed in the fall of 2013, after his final year with the New York Yankees.\n\nHe pitched in just 35 games in 2014, posting a 6.84 ERA. Last season, working primarily as a lefty specialist, he made 60 appearances, posting a 4.33 ERA.\n\nLogan said he doesn\u2019t know when he will pitch in a spring game, but he was encouraged by a 25-pitch bullpen session Saturday.\n\nRockies Mailbag: Pose a question for Patrick Saunders\n\n\u201cIt felt good \u2026 I definitely think I can be ready (for opening day),\u201d he said, adding that there is no structural problem with his elbow.\n\nInjury updates. The Rockies haven\u2019t suffered any major injuries so far this spring. They do, however, have a few players sidelined.\n\nThe most concerning injury is the strained right oblique suffered by pitching prospect Tyler Anderson. He was scratched about 15 minutes before first pitch on Saturday while playing catch. He\u2019s scheduled to undergo an MRI on Monday.\n\nAnderson, the team\u2019s top draft pick out of Oregon in 2011, has a 6.75 ERA in two Cactus League games. He missed last season because of a stress fracture in his left elbow suffered late in the 2014 season at Double-A Tulsa.\n\nUtility infielder Daniel Descalso\u2019s left hand remains swollen and he will also get an MRI on Monday. He was hit by a pitch on Friday.\n\n\u201cWe X-rayed it and there were no broken bones, so that\u2019s a good thing,\u201d Descalso said Sunday. \u201cBut it\u2019s still really swollen, so we want to see what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\nDescalso, 29, is a veteran, so missing a few spring games is not a big deal to him. Still, he wants to get back on the field.\n\n\u201cI want to get this cleaned up and get back to it,\u201d he said. \u201cI realize that now is the time to be cautious and not push it. Yeah, I want to get out there and play, but I want to make sure it\u2019s not something that is going to linger.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Boone Logan, Rockies\u2019 lefty, hoping elbow pain is minor spring hurdle", "title": "Boone Logan, Rockies\u2019 lefty, hoping elbow pain is minor spring hurdle", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/03/13/boone-logan-rockies-lefty-hoping-elbow-pain-is-minor-spring-hurdle/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160313__Boone-Loganp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160313__Boone-Loganp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-13T20:24:47+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-14T22:09:27+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. \u2014 The crux of Boone Logan\u2019s problem is his left elbow.\nHe missed last season because of a stress fracture in his left elbow suffered late in the 2014 season at Double-A Tulsa.\nLogan, who signed a three-year, $16.5 million deal with the Rockies before the 2014 season, said he \u201cgot a little quick, a little too soon\u201d when spring training opened.\nLogan said he doesn\u2019t know when he will pitch in a spring game, but he was encouraged by a 25-pitch bullpen session Saturday.\n\u201cIt just takes a little longer to get going than it did back in the day."}
