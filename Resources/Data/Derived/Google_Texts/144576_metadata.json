The founders came up with an innovative model for an online benefits marketplace, targeted to employers, that foreshadowed the public benefits exchanges established under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe company started out with a focus on serving small clients and now primarily operates exchanges for mid-sized and larger companies, providing benefits to more than 50,000 workers at 800 companies.\n\nThe sale to Towers Watson came together quickly for both companies last fall. Under the sale terms, Liazon retained its brand as it became part of Towers Watson\u2019s Exchange Solutions division, while Subramanian joined the Exchange Solutions executive team as Liazon managing director.\n\n\u201cLiazon had very quickly built a terrific reputation in what we call the private exchange environment, and that was something that our firm felt we really wanted to make a play in,\u201d said James K. Foreman, managing director of Exchange Solutions for Towers Watson.\n\nBryce Williams was CEO of Extend Health, a leader in private exchanges for retirees, when Towers Watson purchased it in 2012. He now oversees its operations within Towers Watson.\n\nDuring his Thursday visit to Buffalo, Williams said Towers Watson has continued to invest in the greater Salt Lake City area, an Extend Health hub, two years after the sale because it \u201creally likes the cost and value and efficiency that we have in some of these mid- to smaller cities of America.\u201d\n\nSubramanian said he understands that Buffalonians get nervous when large, out-of-town companies buy up a smaller, homegrown outfit, but he said geography won\u2019t matter as long as Liazon is meeting its goals and contributing to Towers Watson\u2019s success.\n\n\u201cThe Buffalo issue, if you will, is just not that relevant,\u201d said Subramanian, who added that the Towers Watson purchase has accelerated Liazon\u2019s planned growth track.\n\nLiazon\u2019s Buffalo location allows executives to draw from a talented pool of prospective workers, with little worry of turnover because those workers remain loyal to the company, said David Finkel, Liazon\u2019s chief operating officer.\n\nLiazon last year announced its intention to move from its longtime home in leased space at 737 Main St. into the Fairmont building at 199 Scott St., which is being renovated by Ellicott Development Co.\n\nLiazon\u2019s offices on the top floor of the eight-floor building cover 15,000 square feet and feature an open floor plan, exposed brick and diffused lighting. Executives wanted the look of the space to reflect \u201cthe personality of Liazon,\u201d Finkel said.\n\nAs part of its expansion into the seventh floor of the building, the company by next month hopes to bring a first batch of 20 or 30 new workers into space that can be used as renovations are completed.\n\nLiazon officials hope that construction work on the seventh floor, which has another 15,000 square feet of space, will be finished by October and hiring of the additional workers can continue through the end of the year and into 2015. Liazon also has 20 or 25 employees based in New York City.\n\nemail: swatson@buffnews.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Liazon Corp., the Buffalo-based operator of private health insurance exchanges, is taking steps to double its workforce here, just two months after moving into new offices in downtown Buffalo.The company has 128 workers who fill the eighth floor of the former Fairmont Creamery building on ...", "og": {"site_name": "www.buffaloNews.com", "description": "Liazon Corp., the Buffalo-based operator of private health insurance exchanges, is taking steps to double its workforce here, just two months after moving into new offices in downtown Buffalo.The company has 128 workers who fill the eighth floor of the former Fairmont Creamery building on ... - The Buffalo News", "title": "Liazon hopes to add 135 jobs at Scott Street offices  - The Buffalo News", "url": "http://www.buffalonews.com/business/liazon-hopes-to-add-135-jobs-at-scott-street-offices-20140710", "image": "http://www.buffalonews.com/storyimage/BN/20140710/BUSINESS/140719938/AR/0/AR-140719938.jpg&exactW=1000&exactH=1000&AlignV=middle&Q=80", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TheBuffaloNews", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": "51000084,100004991951001"}, "__sync_contentCategory": "PayWall", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Bryce Williams was CEO of Extend Health, a leader in private exchanges for retirees, when Towers Watson purchased it in 2012.\nThe sale to Towers Watson came together quickly for both companies last fall.\nHe now oversees its operations within Towers Watson.\nLiazon on Thursday opened its offices in the Fairmont building to invited guests, elected officials and visitors from Towers Watson as part of an official Buffalo \u201cLiazon Day\u201d meant to highlight the company\u2019s rapid growth in its hometown.\nLiazon was founded in 2007 by three Buffalo-area natives \u2013 Subramanian, Tim Godzich and Alan Cohen \u2013 with health insurance industry experience."}
