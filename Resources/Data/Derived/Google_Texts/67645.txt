Those in search of Front Range snow on Christmas Day might want to get out a compass before peering out the window.

“If you’re jonesing for a white Christmas, look to the north side of buildings,” Robert Koopmeiners, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Boulder, said Sunday morning.

That is where the shade will be — and any hope of laying eyes on the remnants of last week’s snowstorm. Between now and Christmas Day, chances are very low of getting any kind of precipitation, Koopmeiners said.

The National Weather Service defines a white Christmas as having 1 inch of snow on the ground on Christmas Day.

For those who live by the glass-half-full standard, they may want to cling to the service’s bleak prediction of a 10 percent chance of snow on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day.

“It does not look good,” Koopmeiners said.

The slightly better chance for snow exists on Christmas night heading into Saturday, he said, but even then the likelihood is small.

“There is a low pressure trough over the northern part of the country, but I don’t see a lot of energy with it,” Koopmeiners said.

Snow-lovers shouldn’t feel too bad about the lack of white predicted for Friday. Only 44 Christmases in the past 115 years — or 38 percent — have qualified as white Christmases.

That percentage drops to 14 percent if you seek measurable snow actually falling from the sky.

The freshest snow to fall for Christmas morning was just three years ago, when nearly 3 inches of the stuff fell at Denver International Airport overnight on Christmas Eve. Last year saw even more snow on Christmas, but the storm didn’t start until the afternoon.
