MIAMI (CBSMiami/AP) — A dozen health centers around the state will be able to offer preventative health services to more low income patients thanks to an additional $11 million in funds from the Obama administration.

Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell announced recently the funds will help provide care to an estimated 38,405 new patients. The investment builds on the $6 million given to Florida health centers in September. The funding stems from the Affordable Care Act.

A main tenant of the health law was not only to get more people insured but to offer them preventive services and connect them with primary care doctors so they don’t wind up in emergency rooms when they are sicker and more expensive to treat.

Nationally, the Obama administration says the law has funded health centers and helped them add 6 million patients.
