Parenteau from different lines starting with Tuesday\u2019s practice at the Family Sports Center.\n\nInstead of skating on a line with Matt Duchene and Ryan O\u2019Reilly, Parenteau will play with rookie Nathan MacKinnon and Jamie McGinn, starting with Wednesday\u2019s preseason game against the Anaheim Ducks at the Pepsi Center.\n\nDownie will skate at right wing with Duchene and O\u2019Reilly. In explaining the decision, Roy said the new lines balance each other.\n\n\u201c(Duchene) and O\u2019Reilly, I think they love to have the puck, and P.A. loves to have the puck as well. At some point, someone\u2019s going to have to go get that puck,\u201d Roy said. \u201cI think Downie brings that, and brings a lot of grit to that line. I think it\u2019s a good mix. P.A. is a very experienced guy, and I think he will help Nathan a lot.\u201d\n\nDuchene and Parenteau clicked well on a line together last season, but just because aren\u2019t on the same one going now doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t play together again at times. Roy is likely to mix his lines again, and the two figure to be on the ice together plenty on the Avs\u2019 first power-play unit.\n\nThe other top Avs line of Paul Stastny, Gabe Landeskog and Alex Tanguay remains intact.\n\nWilson injured.\n\nAvalanche defenseman Ryan Wilson, who figures to see plenty of ice time on the top four this season, will miss about two weeks with a knee injury, Roy said.\n\nWilson suffered the injury in Sunday\u2019s Burgundy-White scrimmage at the Air Force Academy. Roy said the team is optimistic Wilson won\u2019t miss any more than two weeks.\n\nWilson missed much of last season with ankle injuries.\n\nFootnotes.\n\nGoalie Semyon Varlamov will start Wednesday\u2019s exhibition debut against Anaheim. Colorado opens the regular season against the Ducks on Oct. 2. Rookie Spencer Martin will serve as Varlamov\u2019s backup and likely play half the game. While Duchene, O\u2019Reilly and Downie will get the night off Wednesday, the line of Stastny, Landeskog and Tanguay will play against Anaheim.\n\n\u2026 The Pepsi Center will unveil a new scoreboard and sound system at the game.\n\n\u2026 Roy put players through a grueling skate at the end of practice Tuesday. He was not happy with some of his team\u2019s play in the Burgundy-White scrimmage Sunday, saying \u201cthe decision-making wasn\u2019t very good at times.\u201d Overall, though, Roy said he has liked his team\u2019s effort through. \u201cWe were 29th last year, so I guess we have to be different,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve liked what I\u2019ve (seen) out there. We\u2019re going to work hard. That\u2019s the way it\u2019s going to be every day.\u201d\n\n\u2026 The Avs signed defenseman Chris Bigras to a three-year, entry-level contract.\n\nAdrian Dater: adater@denverpost.com or twitter.com/adater\n\nDUCKS at AVALANCHE\n\nTime: 7 p.m., Wednesday\n\nLocation: Pepsi Center\n\n2012-13 records: Anaheim 30-12-6 (Second in Pacific Division); Colorado 16-25-7 (Fifth in Northwest Division)\n\nTV: None\n\nRadio: 950 AM\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Nathan MacKinnon gets new linemate as Patrick Roy tweaks Avs for preseason", "title": "Nathan MacKinnon gets new linemate as Patrick Roy tweaks Avs for preseason", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/09/17/nathan-mackinnon-gets-new-linemate-as-patrick-roy-tweaks-avs-for-preseason/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130915__avs-nathan-mackinnonp1-1.jpg", "height": 399}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130915__avs-nathan-mackinnonp1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-17T13:15:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-29T06:37:12+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdac22\"", "article_summary": "At some point, someone\u2019s going to have to go get that puck,\u201d Roy said.\nThe Avalanche hasn\u2019t played its first preseason game yet, and new coach Patrick Roy already has decided to change his top lines.\nThat\u2019s the way it\u2019s going to be every day.\u201d\u2026 The Avs signed defenseman Chris Bigras to a three-year, entry-level contract.\nWhile Duchene, O\u2019Reilly and Downie will get the night off Wednesday, the line of Stastny, Landeskog and Tanguay will play against Anaheim.\n\u201c(Duchene) and O\u2019Reilly, I think they love to have the puck, and P.A."}
