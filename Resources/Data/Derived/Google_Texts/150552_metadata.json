The insurer\u2019s coverage was often not priced competitively, officials have said.\n\nBut UnitedHealth is not alone in warning that the financial losses in the ObamaCare marketplaces are reaching dangerous levels.\n\nOther insurers that play a bigger role in the marketplaces, including some Blue Cross Blue Shield plans, have also raised the prospect of pulling back some of their ObamaCare plans.\n\nInsurance companies are expected to seek significant premium increases next year to stem their losses. In the past, the impact on consumers has been blunted by ObamaCare\u2019s tax credits.\n\nStates will have the power to accept or reject the premium increases.\n\nRepublicans have long warned that ObamaCare would \u201ccollapse under its own weight,\u201d and they seized on the UnitedHealth news to press their case.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t about spreadsheets and quarterly reports \u2014 it\u2019s about the President\u2019s broken promise that families would have more choices under ObamaCare,\u201d Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) said in a statement Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThis year, in 36 percent of the nation\u2019s counties, families could pick between only one or two insurers on the exchange and, given today\u2019s news, next year looks like it could be even worse.\"\n\nThe administration, meanwhile, said it expects that insurers will both come and go as the new insurance markets set up by the Affordable Care Act develop. But overall, they say the law is working as planned.\n\n\u201cThe Marketplace is a reliable source of coverage for millions of Americans with a robust number of plan choices,\u201d Department of Health and Human Services spokesman Ben Wakana said in a statement. \u201cWe have full confidence, based on data, that the Marketplaces will continue to thrive for years ahead.\u201d\n\nA Kaiser Family Foundation study on Monday found that if UnitedHealth pulled out of all 34 states in which it participated in 2016, the number of choices for consumers would decline. The percentage of U.S. counties with only one or two insurers to choose from would grow from 36 percent to 53 percent, the study found.\n\nBut premiums would not be affected greatly because UnitedHealth often does not offer one of the cheapest plans, according to the study.\n\nIt remains unclear in what states UnitedHealth will continue to offer ObamaCare coverage, though it appears that the company will be leaving most of the 34 states where it now participates.\n\nCaroline Pearson, senior vice president at Avalere Health, a consulting firm, said that premium increases for insurers to halt their losses next year are likely but that it would be a healthy move that would allow insurers to stop losing money.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it should be especially worrying,\u201d she said of UnitedHealth\u2019s decision. \u201cBut I do think it speaks to some of the very real challenges that plans are experiencing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI'm certainly not expecting a lot of other plans to drop out,\u201d she said, noting that UnitedHealth is different than other insurers because it entered the ObamaCare market late looking for a \u201cgrowth opportunity.\u201d\n\nThe ObamaCare market has been smaller and costlier than expected, partly due to the number of sicker enrollees.\n\n\u201cThe smaller overall market size and shorter term, higher risk profile within this market segment continue to suggest we cannot broadly serve it on an effective and sustained basis,\u201d Hemsley, the UnitedHealth CEO, said on the earnings call in explaining the company\u2019s move.\n\n\u2014 This story was updated at 2:02 p.m.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The insurer said it will keep participating in a \"handful\" of states.", "description": "The insurer said it will keep participating in a \"handful\" of states.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Peter Sullivan", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The insurer said it will keep participating in a \"handful\" of states.", "title": "UnitedHealth pulling out of most ObamaCare markets", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/276787-unitedhealth-pulling-out-of-most-obamacare-markets", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/obamacare_122815getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-04-19T14:54:45-04:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-04-19T14:54-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/276787-unitedhealth-pulling-out-of-most-obamacare-markets", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2016-04-19T09:30-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Peter Sullivan", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2016-04-19T09:30:02-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T14:54:45-04:00"}, "keywords": "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, UnitedHealth Group, Insurance,,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/276787-unitedhealth-pulling-out-of-most-obamacare-markets", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The insurer said it will keep participating in a \"handful\" of states.", "card": "summary", "title": "UnitedHealth pulling out of most ObamaCare markets"}, "dcterms.title": "UnitedHealth pulling out of most ObamaCare markets"}, "article_summary": "The insurer UnitedHealth is pulling out of the ObamaCare marketplaces in all but a \u201chandful\u201d of states in 2017, the company announced Tuesday.\nBut UnitedHealth is not alone in warning that the financial losses in the ObamaCare marketplaces are reaching dangerous levels.\nOther insurers that play a bigger role in the marketplaces, including some Blue Cross Blue Shield plans, have also raised the prospect of pulling back some of their ObamaCare plans.\nIt remains unclear in what states UnitedHealth will continue to offer ObamaCare coverage, though it appears that the company will be leaving most of the 34 states where it now participates.\nRepublicans have long warned that ObamaCare would \u201ccollapse under its own weight,\u201d and they seized on the UnitedHealth news to press their case."}
