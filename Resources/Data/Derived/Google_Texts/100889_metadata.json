Her agency will implement the Affordable Care Act and cope with the aftermath of several tragic deaths of children under the care of the Department of Children and Families.\n\nBaker has now announced three Cabinet secretaries, all of whom, like his chief of staff selection, have state government experience.\n\nAmong them, Sudders, 60, who Baker\u2019s transition team said is not enrolled in a political party, is perhaps the best-known figure on Beacon Hill. She has served in and around government for decades.\n\n\u201cHaving dedicated my professional life to social work, mental health, and caring for the most vulnerable members of our society, I am humbled and inspired to take on this role,\u201d Sudders said in a statement distributed by Baker.\n\nBaker aides said Sudders was not available for an interview Friday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDemocratic Attorney General Martha Coakley, Baker\u2019s election opponent, praised the pick.\n\n\u201cI have the utmost respect for Marylou Sudders, particularly her work to protect children and improve mental health care for all. I commend Governor-elect Baker for appointing Marylou,\u201d Coakley said in a press release.\n\nMaria Z. Mossaides, executive director of Cambridge Family and Children\u2019s Service and the chairwoman of the Children\u2019s League of Massachusetts, said Sudders has \u201cvery broad public policy experience,\u201d describing her as a \u201cfabulous, fabulous choice.\u201d\n\nMost recently, Sudders was one of eight specialists in a range of fields who were called upon by House Speaker Robert A. DeLeo to develop gun-control legislation, which passed into law in August.\n\nLast summer, after Governor Deval Patrick reluctantly removed Olga Roche as the head of the embattled DCF, Patrick called on Sudders to serve as one of several advisers to the incoming DCF chief, Erin Deveney, a lawyer with no prior child welfare experience.\n\nNow, DCF and other troubled agencies will be Sudders\u2019 responsibility. SEIU Local 509 \u2014 the union that represents more than 17,000 human service workers in Massachusetts, including DCF employees \u2014 applauded Sudders\u2019 selection, calling her \u201ca mental health expert with whom we have a long history of collaboration.\u201d\n\n\u201cBoth as commissioner of the Department of Mental Health and executive director of the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, Massachusetts providers have long worked with Marylou Sudders to improve services for some of the Commonwealth\u2019s most vulnerable populations,\u201d Local 509 president Susan Tousignant said in a statement.\n\nSudders will also oversee the state\u2019s health care website, which failed last October, frustrating consumers and costing millions. And she will have to handle the advent of medical marijuana dispensaries, which have seen a rollout fraught with problems.\n\nJudy Meredith, a veteran human services lobbyist who has worked with Sudders for years, said she is adept at diagnosing such problems and developing solutions.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s honest, forthright, and doesn\u2019t put the blame on everybody else,\u201d Meredith said. \u201cShe\u2019s smart and tactical and very convincing in her arguments to legislators.\u201d\n\nSudders would become the first woman to receive a high-profile post in the Baker administration. He has named three men as his chief of staff, top housing and economic development aide, and energy and environmental affairs secretary.\n\nHis campaign policy chief, Elizabeth Mahoney, will also have a prominent role within the administration, Baker advisers say.\n\nSudders\u2019 work in mental health dates to 1978, according to her online curriculum vitae. She sits on the state\u2019s Health Policy Commission, a Coakley appointee.\n\nShe has taught at the Boston College Graduate School of Social Work since 2012.\n\nBaker\u2019s choice for the health and human services secretariat has been among his most closely watched selections.\n\nA former health and human services chief himself, in the Weld administration, Baker during the campaign was outspoken in his criticism of Patrick\u2019s handling of DCF.\n\nDuring and after the campaign, Baker warned about the cost to taxpayers of implementing the Affordable Care Act.", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "4.0.413926579", "eomportal-id": 635738, "description": "Governor-elect Charlie Baker\u2019s choice to run the state\u2019s health and human services secretariat, Marylou Sudders, was commissioner of the state Department of Mental Health from 1996 to 2003.", "eomportal-instanceid": 15, "og": {"city": "Boston", "site_name": "BostonGlobe.com", "description": "Governor-elect Charlie Baker\u2019s choice to run the state\u2019s health and human services secretariat, Marylou Sudders, was commissioner of the state Department of Mental Health from 1996 to 2003.", "title": "Baker poised to name Marylou Sudders health and human services chief - The Boston Globe", "url": "https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2014/11/21/baker-poised-name-health-and-human-services-chief/i21Brkj7lia1wCzYWeUJcK/story.html", "country": "US", "image": "http://c.o0bg.com/rf/image_585w/Boston/2011-2020/2014/11/21/BostonGlobe.com/Metro/Images/sudders-7732.jpg", "longitude": "-71.0597732", "state": "MA", "latitude": "42.3584308", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 95431448, "card": "summary", "site": "BostonGlobe"}, "robots": "noarchive", "news_keywords": "Charlie Baker,Marylou Sudders,Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, Martha Coakley, Deval L  Patrick,Health and Human Services Department, Department of Children and Families (NJ), Boston College, Twitter", "eomportal-lastUpdate": "Thu May 26 02:10:22 EDT 2016", "fb": {"admins": 507486035, "app_id": 103933749691726, "pages": 5637143257}, "keywords": "Charlie Baker,Marylou Sudders,Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, Martha Coakley, Deval L  Patrick,Health and Human Services Department, Department of Children and Families (NJ), Boston College, Twitter", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/globe"}, "flashsale": "false", "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "eomportal-uuid": "ba091130-718a-11e4-bf2d-a3a4d7f80ad7"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8c0f\"", "article_summary": "AdvertisementAs head of the Executive Office of Health and Human Services, Sudders will lead a $19.4 billion agency, nearly three times the next largest in state government.\nA former health and human services chief himself, in the Weld administration, Baker during the campaign was outspoken in his criticism of Patrick\u2019s handling of DCF.\nBill Brett for the Boston Globe/File Marylou SuddersGovernor-elect Charlie Baker on Friday named a veteran mental health administrator and child protection advocate to lead the state\u2019s sprawling health and human services secretariat.\nBaker\u2019s choice for the health and human services secretariat has been among his most closely watched selections.\n\u201cI have the utmost respect for Marylou Sudders, particularly her work to protect children and improve mental health care for all."}
