Employees working an average of 30 hours per week (130 total monthly hours) are considered full time. The FTE requirement can raise several questions for employers. For example, seasonal employees who work six months or less will generally not be considered full-time employees. Also, hours contributed to tax-exempt organizations are excluded. To determine full-time status for the current year, employers may use a simplified \u201clook back\u201d method that takes into account hours worked by seasonal and part-time employees last year. Assistance on FTEs is available at https://www.healthcare.gov/fte-calculator.\n\nCompanies with 50 or fewer FTEs are not required to provide coverage but must file reports to the government if they offer a health plan. They also need to notify employees that they are required to purchase health insurance privately or through the individual exchange (www. healthcare.gov).\n\nCompanies with 50 to 99 FTEs now have until 2016 to comply with the ACA, buying them another year when they will have to start reporting information about their insurance plan. In order to avoid a fine they must cover substantially all (95 percent) full-time workers.\n\nCompanies with more than 100 FTE employees will need to provide coverage for substantially all their employees in 2015 or pay a penalty as well as report information about their plan.\n\nThe SHOP exchange will be open for companies with 50 or fewer FTEs starting Nov. 15. Beginning in late October, small business owners, agents and brokers will be able to create an account, select a federally facilitated SHOP-certified agent or broker, verify their eligibility and input employee information into the exchange.\n\nEmployers will not be able to actually shop or compare plan prices until after Nov. 15. Firms with more than 50 FTEs won\u2019t be able to use the exchanges until Nov. 15, 2015. In the meantime, small businesses can apply for the SHOP plans and tax breaks using a paper application. Businesses with 100 or more FTE won\u2019t be able to use the SHOP until 2016.\n\nAccording to Linda A. Hines, who has worked with small employers over the past 20 years, the options for a small employer to stay within the private marketplace compared to the SHOP, and possibly receive a small employer tax credit, need detailed analysis. Often health plans from the private marketplace offer more benefits, but each situation is different so one must evaluate and compare each offering.\n\nEmployers should compare the plan\u2019s total cost as well as the employer and employee contributions. The networks may not offer the same plans and the number of plan design choices will be different. A proper cost analysis should be performed to determine which program is the best decision.\n\nIf your employee equivalents do not require you to offer a group medical plan, there are still disclosure requirements about the health care marketplace that must be given to employees. You also need to ensure COBRA/State Continuation communication materials are updated.\n\nAccording to Hines, a good consultant should understand all aspects of offering plans, communication requirements, analysis and plan costs. From pension and profit sharing plans to group medical and individual products, your benefits consultant should be able to create and implement comprehensive packages for your employees that can compete with the large employer market and not break the bank on cost.\n\nTo learn more, attend Score\u2019s ACA seminar Wednesday at the Bordini Center in Grand Chute.
