The final package is expected to look somewhat similar to the Senate's recently approved opioid legislation. The story for Pros: http://politico.pro/1RNrNQ6\n\nGOOD MORNING \u2014 IT's MONDAY PULSE. And after spending more than a week in icy Cleveland, your author is thrilled that there's snow place like home.

The poorest residents of California, New York and Vermont, for instance, live several years longer than similarly poor residents of Nevada, Indiana and Oklahoma. And that suggests that local policies and public health initiatives can make a difference in blunting the effects of poverty, the researchers conclude.\n\nRead the JAMA study: http://bit.ly/1SrFn7L\n\n\u2014 Angus Deaton. \"It seems unlikely that another study of income, location, and mortality will ever have more or better data,\" the Nobel laureate writes in a critique. However, Deaton points out that researchers may have overestimated the current gap in life expectancy but underestimated the pace at which it's widening: http://bit.ly/25TYLUV\n\n\u2014 The local angle.

As Pro's Rachana Pradhan reports, those ideas include:\n\n1) Setting a cap on the growth on per capita health care spending. Massachusetts and Maryland have done this, while negotiating agreements with the federal government to share the savings that resulted.\n\n2) Implementing bundled payments for all payers. To expedite this idea, states should build off of bundles that have been developed in other places or for Medicare, including for hip replacements, knee replacements, prenatal care and delivery, asthma hospitalizations and stent placement.\n\n3) Improving long-term care delivery such as by relying more on home- and community-based services, offering health homes to patients with several chronic conditions, and encouraging individuals to buy long-term care insurance by offering them refundable tax credits.\n\nRead the full report here: http://ampr.gs/1RZRBFa\n\nAHIP CEO POINTS OUT PROBLEMS IN THE MARKETPLACE \u2014 Speaking at the Association for Health Care Journalists conference, AHIP CEO Marilyn Tavenner said she feels patients' pain over \u201csurprise bills\u201d \u2014 which result, for instance, when a patient goes to an in-network hospital but is treated by an out-of-network provider. Health systems and insurers must do more to educate patients, to help them avoid the nasty surprises, she said.\n\nAddressing some consumer or advocate concerns about health insurance will make it more expensive, she said, and the ACA exchange business so far is only profitable in three states: California, Vermont and Washington. \u201cThe market is still finding its way to stability,\" Tavenner said.\n\nShe also noted the obstacles to getting more young and healthy people to sign up \u2014 and shared a personal experience. According to Tavenner, she tried to get her uninsured waiter to get covered the night before. She failed; he\u2019s going bare until it\u2019s cheaper to get covered than to pay the fine.\n\nANOTHER PROBLEM: SHORT-TERM INSURANCE POLICIES ARE SURGING \u2014 That's according to the Wall Street Journal, which notes that the temporary policies aren't compliant with ACA regulations but are gaining popularity because they're significantly cheaper than marketplace plans and sold year-round. One company said short-term sales in 2015 were about 150% higher than in 2013.\n\n\u2014 Advocates are worried that consumers don't understand the risks. Short-term plans don't exempt customers from the ACA's individual mandate penalty and tend to offer limited services, like refusing to cover pre-existing conditions. \"This is exactly the kind of coverage the ACA was designed to get rid of,\" said Larry Levitt of the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nRead the story: http://on.wsj.com/20tSj2X\n\n** A message from National Community Pharmacists Association (NCPA): More transparency is needed into generic drug pricing and reimbursement rates set by drug plan middlemen. Bipartisan legislation (H.R. 244) would enhance oversight of federal health programs and help ensure pharmacy reimbursement for generic drugs reflects market fluctuations.

Instead, doctors had prescribed it less than 4,000 times as of February. http://nyti.ms/1Xqb45I\n\nIt was another busy weekend on the campaign trail:\n\nTRUMP's HEALTH CARE IDEAS BASHED AGAIN \u2014 This time in a cover story in Saturday's New York Times, with Democrats and Republicans both saying they're bewildered by Donald Trump's health policy proposals.\n\nThe identity of Trump's health advisers has been an ongoing mystery \u2014 POLITICO's Paul Demko had a good investigation last month \u2014 but the Times offers a number, if not a name: At least half a dozen \u201cvery prominent people\" are advising Trump on health policy, according to a campaign official. But they \"are not ready to have their support of the Trump campaign known,\" Trump's chief policy adviser Sam Clovis told the Times.\n\nIS CRUZ TOO CONSERVATIVE TO WIN THE NOMINATION? \u2014 Pro\u2019s Nancy Cook looked at just how conservative Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s policy proposals are \u2014 far, far to the right of Trump. In fact, he would be the most conservative GOP nominee since Barry Goldwater ... who got clobbered in 1964 by Lyndon Johnson. Cruz opposes abortion even in cases of rape and incest \u2014 views that are out of sync with those of the majority of Americans, Nancy reports. More on where Cruz stands here: http://politi.co/25TCNkX\n\nAnd here's what we heard on the Sunday shows:\n\nCLINTON: CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM IS ALSO MENTAL HEALTH REFORM \u2014 On CNN's State of the Union, Hillary Clinton said that tough crime laws enacted in the 1990s (that is, during her husband's presidency, though she didn't say so) have led to over-incarceration, which has negatively affected the mentally ill.\n\n\"We have to deal with the consequences,\" Clinton said. Many incarcerated people \"have an addiction problem [or] a mental health problem.\" She added that she wants \"to do more\" to help these individuals re-enter society.\n\nOBAMA: POLARIZED MEDIA HELPS CREATE HEALTH CARE MYTHS \u2014 Appearing on Fox News Sunday, President Barack Obama said that the growth of cable TV and slanted media contribute to unwarranted cynicism about health reform.\n\n\"When Republicans promise to repeal Obamacare, and it doesn\u2019t get repealed, [viewers are] outraged,\" Obama said. \"It must be because Republicans were corrupt or unresponsive, or big money got involved. [And] if Democrats get frustrated, they say, 'Well, why didn\u2019t we have a public option in our healthcare system? Or have a single payer system?'\"\n\n\u2014 Obama added that most Americans are happy with the state of employer-based health care and that's why neither liberals nor conservatives have achieved everything they've wanted with health reform. \"It wasn\u2019t necessarily because there was ... corruption, or venality,\" the president said. \"People disagree.\"\n\nSTATE WEEK: BIGGER HURDLE AHEAD FOR ARKANSAS EXPANSION \u2014 The Arkansas state legislature this week kicks off its fiscal session, in which lawmakers will give final consideration to the governor's Arkansas Works proposal to extend Medicaid expansion.

The lack of transparency also raises questions as to whether drug plan middlemen, pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) corporations, are overpaid by Medicare and other federal health programs. Moreover, when generic drug prices spike, PBM corporations are slow to update reimbursement rates, leaving community pharmacies with payments that don\u2019t cover costs and unsustainable financial losses. H.R. 244 would increase transparency and facilitate timely payment updates.
