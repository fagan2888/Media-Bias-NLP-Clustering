The Oscar-winning actress Mary Steenburgen will have a recurring role in the fifth season of the FX drama Justified, The Hollywood Reporter reports.

Beginning with the tenth episode in the season, Steenburgen will play “Katherine Hale, a beautiful, Southern belle who was the wife of Wynn Duffy’s (Jere Burns) mentor in crime.”

Michael Rapaport, Amy Smart, Alicia Witt, Damon Herriman, AJ Buckley, James LeGros, Steve Harris and Wood Harris are among the other new cast members to appear on Justified in season 5.

Earlier this week, FX officially announced that Justified will end its run after the sixth season.

“It was [showrunner] Graham Yost and Timothy Olyphant’s decision,” FX’s John Landgraf told reporters Jan. 14 at winter TCA. “I would have liked to have had more Justified. It’s one of my favorite shows.”

Programming president for FX, Nick Grad told Variety that “Another metric that’s important to us [beyond ratings] is, ‘What shows are going to be talked about in the next 20 years?’ If you’re making a great, 80-hour movie, it has to have a beginning, middle and end. Going out at the right time is going to make your show last forever — we want to make shows that stand the test of time.”

Justified airs Tuesdays 10pm on FX
