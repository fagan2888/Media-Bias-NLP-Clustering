But that doesn't mean we have a monolithic, homogeneous population. To the contrary,\" he told The Associated Press before headlining a legislative fundraiser in Cedar Rapids. \"The power of America is a set of shared values with a very diverse population embracing it.\"\n\nLed by billionaire developer Donald Trump, other GOP presidential hopefuls have aired urged newcomers to assimilate. Some have suggested it's their duty.\n\nRecently, in South Carolina, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio was interrupted by applause when he said legal status for immigrants should be determined by what they could contribute and \"whether they want to live in America or whether they want to be American.\"\n\nTrump has climbed to the top of national Republican preference polls in part by using stronger language. He's described illegal immigrants often as violent, predatory criminals, vowing to deport them by the millions and proposing to build a wall between the United States and Mexico.\n\nThe approach clashes with the Republican Party's effort to attract support from the increasingly influential Hispanic community, which the GOP has named as critical to the party's successes. The national GOP is hosting events across the country to mark Hispanic Heritage Month.\n\nCompared to most of his Republican rivals, Bush's personal story gives his credibility with Latinos. His wife, Columba, is a Mexican native. Bush sometimes campaigns in Spanish and is fond of relating details that highlight the influence of Hispanic culture at home.\n\n\"We eat Mexican food in the home. My children are Hispanic in many aspects. We don't talk about it, but the Hispanic influence is an important part of my life,\" Bush said in a July interview with Telemundo.\n\nBush even took a shot at Trump on the issue, mocking the front-runner's credibility.\n\n\"Mr. Trump says that I can't speak Spanish,\" Bush, speaking Spanish, told supporters recently in Miami. \"Pobrecito\" (poor guy).\n\nYet Bush has used the term \"anchor babies\" to describe infants whose parents come to the United States specifically so the children are born in the United States and granted automatic citizenship. The term is considered offensive in the Hispanic community. Bush later said he was referring mostly to the so-called birth tourism industry that flies wealthy Asian women to the U.S. to give birth \u2014 a real phenomenon that has drawn concern from the Obama administration.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Steve Peoples in Washington contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFollow Thomas Beaumont at https://twitter.com/TomBeaumont\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected by deleting erroneous definition of a multicultural society.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republican Bush says multiculturalism wrong for US - AP News: CEDAR FALLS, Iowa (AP) \u2014 Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush .05/27/2016 2:26:16AM EST.", "author": "AP News", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "CEDAR FALLS, Iowa (AP) \u2014 Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush said Tuesday that multiculturalism is", "title": "AP News - Republican Bush says multiculturalism wrong for US", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/politics-elections/2015/09/22/republicans-bush-says-multiculturalism-wrong-for-us-n2055649", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015\\265\\96cb2a6a-ecff-4613-b258-49bca85cc6b7.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "CEDAR FALLS, Iowa (AP) \u2014 Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush said Tuesday that multiculturalism is", "title": "AP News - Republican Bush says multiculturalism wrong for US", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/politics-elections/2015/09/22/republicans-bush-says-multiculturalism-wrong-for-us-n2055649", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/265/96cb2a6a-ecff-4613-b258-49bca85cc6b7.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Republican Bush says multiculturalism wrong for US, AP News, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "CEDAR FALLS, Iowa (AP) \u2014 Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush said Tuesday that multiculturalism is bad for the United States, adding that immigrants who close themselves off from American culture deny themselves access to economic rewards.\n\"Mr. Trump says that I can't speak Spanish,\" Bush, speaking Spanish, told supporters recently in Miami.\nYet Bush has used the term \"anchor babies\" to describe infants whose parents come to the United States specifically so the children are born in the United States and granted automatic citizenship.\nLed by billionaire developer Donald Trump, other GOP presidential hopefuls have aired urged newcomers to assimilate.\nBut Bush said later he viewed multiculturalism as not aspiring to an American ideal."}
