Rockford

-U.S senator Mark Kirk and his group of veterans called “Battle Buddies” meet and greet members of the navy blue angels and the army golden knights during Rockford Airfest before they take flight.

Jesus Arteaga of the “Battle Buddies” says, "(Battle Buddies is) part of the warriors guarding warriors. Anytime there is a veteran struggling with any issues such as PTSD, mental health or, just any issues that they have at all, we're there for them.”

Sean McKnight of the group adds, "It's a different place when you come home, it's hard to take that key out of the ignition. It had been for me. And all these buddies of mine, the same way. So we work together.”

Kirk started the statewide support group back in February as a way to show support for the men and women who serve, and to let veterans know they are not forgotten.

Kirk says, "Especially with our Vietnam guys, to thank them twice because they weren't properly thanked.”

The senator, who underwent intensive therapy after suffering a stroke back in 2012, is pushing injured veterans to set physical goals with their rehab.

Kirk says, “The best way to say thank you to a vet who has given all to his country, is to make sure we give it all back, and give good healthcare. I want to make sure after this veteran's scandal, that we correct all the problems that were uncovered.”
