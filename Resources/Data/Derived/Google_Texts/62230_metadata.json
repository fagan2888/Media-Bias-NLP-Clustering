Rick Scott please stand up?\n\nIf the Rick Scott of 2015 is the one seen on the campaign trail over the past six months, his second term will be more responsive and compassionate to average people; less ideologically driven, less partisan, and most of all, less cruel to the vulnerable and needy.\n\nBut if it\u2019s the Rick Scott from the beginning of his first term? That\u2019s a different story.\n\n\u201cWe need a conservative who is not afraid to upset the apple cart,\u201d he said then.\n\nVoters have short memories. It\u2019s easy to forget that he entered office in 2011 like a bull in a china shop, proposing $3 billion in cuts to public education before the legislature reined him in to $1.3 billion.\n\nNot satisfied with draconian cuts to the budget, he sought to give away an extra $2 billion in tax breaks. Scott called for slashing the corporate income tax rate and reducing what water management districts could assess property owners \u2013 a proposal that devastated former Gov. Charlie Crist\u2019s plan to restore the Everglades by sending water southward.\n\nScott rejected $2.4 billion in federal high-speed rail stimulus money \u2014 funds that could have created a rail connector between Orlando and Tampa and thousands of good-paying jobs.\n\nHe called for the drug-testing of all state employees and welfare recipients, a policy plainly beneficial to the Solantic Urgent Care chain he founded and later sold.\n\nHe pushed for privatization of state prisons, promising savings of $1 billion a year \u2014 a promise that never materialized.\n\nHe obsessively undermined implementation of the Affordable Care Act, despite Florida\u2019s huge, 4 million population of uninsured residents.\n\nAnd, he signed a bill Crist vetoed requiring women undergoing abortions to have invasive ultrasounds.\n\nBut who was that on the campaign trail this time around? Not the same candidate.\n\nScott this time sounded kinder, more reasonable themes. Instead of rabble-rouser, he cast himself as a man who had brought order to chaos.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s real clear. I cleaned up Charlie Crist\u2019s mess \u2026 I want our state to be No. 1. The No. 1 place where your family can get a job, the No. 1 place for your children to get a great education.\u201d\n\nWho can disagree with that?\n\nNew jobs are important. But if they come at the minimum wage, without benefits, they\u2019re really not helping Florida families much.\n\nImproving the business climate is laudable. But slashing consumer protections and paying back donors through crony contracts isn\u2019t.\n\nPromoting real estate development has its place. But destroying growth management rules that forced developers to account for their environmental impacts, and guaranteed communities didn\u2019t cannibalize each other\u2019s access to water and road capacity, isn\u2019t smart growth.\n\nIt seems that Scott has learned much in four years, but were his lessons simply about rebranding himself as a centrist, or were they about governing with empathy, compassion and restraint?
