During the stop, a K-9 dog sniffed the odor of marijuana coming from the vehicle, and the deputy found he's driving under a suspended license. It was also discovered that Rodriguez De Roux had 103 highly-advanced counterfeit cloned credit cards; each with $10,000 limits.\n\nThe cards had magnetic strips re-encoded with credit card information from the victims, who had their accounts compromised through skimming devices. In this type of case, the victim is actually in possession of their own issued card, while criminals like Rodriguez De Roux possess the account information and utilize it for illegal purposes.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "An ID thief in possession of over $1 million worth of cloned credit cards, along with a stash of marijuana, was busted early Wednesday morning during an I-75 traffic stop by the Lee County Sheriff'...", "og": {"url": "http://www.abc-7.com/story/30611679/lcso-id-thief-with-over-1m-in-fake-credit-cards-busted", "image": "http://ftpcontent.worldnow.com/wncustom/custom/wzvn/wzvn_og_image.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "An ID thief in possession of over $1 million worth of cloned credit cards, along with a stash of marijuana, was busted early Wednesday morning during an I-75 traffic stop by the Lee County Sheriff'...", "title": "LCSO: ID thief with over $1M in fake credit cards busted"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://WZVN.images.worldnow.com/images/9340187_G.jpg", "description": "An ID thief in possession of over $1 million worth of cloned credit cards, along with a stash of marijuana, was busted early Wednesday morning during an I-75 traffic stop by the Lee County Sheriff'...", "card": "summary", "title": "LCSO: ID thief with over $1M in fake credit cards busted"}, "wnreadableurl": "lcso-id-thief-with-over-1m-in-fake-credit-cards-busted", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "WZVN", "fb": {"admins": 1851799707, "app_id": 1678378052403648}, "date": "2015/11/26", "google-site-verification": "gcWGJ_5HBMygrFxFQLREn-pvEzLmkYG-FQepn2WoVSk", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS22"}, "article_summary": "The cards had magnetic strips re-encoded with credit card information from the victims, who had their accounts compromised through skimming devices.\nIt was also discovered that Rodriguez De Roux had 103 highly-advanced counterfeit cloned credit cards; each with $10,000 limits.\nAn ID thief in possession of over $1 million worth of cloned credit cards, along with a stash of marijuana, was busted early Wednesday morning during an I-75 traffic stop by the Lee County Sheriff's Office.\nOn Wednesday, Nov. 23, at approximately 3 a.m., Rodriguez De Roux was stopped by an LCSO deputy after committing several traffic violations on I-75 in Bonita Springs.\nDuring the stop, a K-9 dog sniffed the odor of marijuana coming from the vehicle, and the deputy found he's driving under a suspended license."}
