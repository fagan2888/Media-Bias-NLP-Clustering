"Are you the kind of person who can get projects done ahead of schedule and find files quickly, whenever you need them? If you have your jacket hanging over the side of your cube and you have food out on your desk all day, it doesn't speak to your professionalism," she says.

2. It actually affects your productivity.

Having a messy desk can make you less productive if a lot of time is spent looking for things rather than actually working on assignments, Hosking says.

"The tipping point for employers may be if a worker's desk is negatively affecting his or her productivity or is distracting to colleagues," he explains.

"If you have stacks of paper on your desk, you may think, 'It's OK, I know where everything is,' but how long is it taking you to find things?" Weisman asks. "Maybe you're being as productive as you can be, but maybe not."

In the digital age, where most of our work and files are on the computer, we have fewer excuses for a messy desk, says Joe Weinlick, senior vice president of marketing at career network Beyond.com.

"If you have to move a pile of paper to see your desktop, you are projecting to others that you are undisciplined," he says.

3. You're making a bad impression with clients.

If an employee's "embarrassingly messy" desk is visible to customers or clients and could leave a bad impression, managers may also choose to take action, Hosking cautions.
