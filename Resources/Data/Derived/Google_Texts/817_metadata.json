It's like a 110, or 130 dollars a pill. And you cannot miss one dose ... that's when you develop full-blown AIDS, and there is no cure for that.\"\n\nDonato goes on to say that he was \"wiped out\" by the cost of treatment and only once he was completely broke was he able to qualify for Medicaid.\n\n(The red-haired reality star specifies that he was diagnosed before the availability of the Affordable Care Act, also known as ObamaCare.)\n\nIn response to news that one of his former cast members, Rachel Reilly, stated that she wished he had stayed on Big Brother in light of his diagnosis?\n\nDonato responded that he had no choice but to leave.\n\nHe was not given a choice by producers, he says, though he also wasn't bitter about it, since the situation rocked him to his core and he had to leave.\n\nDick says he needed time to \"digest\" the news of his illness, not to mention plan a course of action regarding treatment, so he harbors no ill will.\n\nYou can watch Couples Therapy online at TV Fanatic to see Dick break the news to his castmates tonight and cope with his illness in the public eye.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Dick Donato spoke with TMZ today about living with HIV.
