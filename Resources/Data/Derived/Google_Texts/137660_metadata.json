Modi has extolled the merits of trickle-down economics through industrialization.\n\nHe also has maintained strong links with the conservative, paramilitary Hindu nationalist group Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, or RSS, which some describe as neo-fascist.\n\nThe RSS \u201cwill have a substantial check on Modi. He is not going to be entirely his own man,\u201d said political analyst Kamal Mitra Chenoy of the Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi.\n\nModi grew up in a poor village family, and at 18 was married to a girl his parents had chosen five years earlier. The union never stuck, and Modi soon left to travel for several years before returning and joining the RSS as a propagandist in his early 20s. He and his wife never had children.\n\nHaving studied political science in Indian universities, Modi formally entered politics in 1985 with the BJP, regarded as the political arm of the RSS. He quickly gained a reputation as a talented orator and a workaholic, campaigning for the BJP in several elections before being chosen as Gujarat\u2019s highest elected official in 2001.", "article_metadata": {"description": "India\u2019s next PM has humble roots, focus on economy", "title": "India\u2019s next PM has humble roots, focus on economy", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "India\u2019s next PM has humble roots, focus on economy", "title": "India\u2019s next PM has humble roots, focus on economy", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/05/16/indias_next_pm_has_humble_roots_focus_on_economy/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/india-elections.jpeg13-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "India\u2019s next PM has humble roots, focus on economy", "title": "India\u2019s next PM has humble roots, focus on economy", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/india-elections.jpeg13-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Katy Daigle", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Born in 1950, Modi will be India\u2019s first prime minister born after the country\u2019s violent 1947 partition and independence from imperial Britain.\nThe top official in Gujarat state for over a decade, Modi often contrasted his humble roots with the posh background of his main rival, 43-year-old Rahul Gandhi, heir to India\u2019s most powerful political dynasty.\nHaving studied political science in Indian universities, Modi formally entered politics in 1985 with the BJP, regarded as the political arm of the RSS.\nTopics: From the Wires, NewsNEW DELHI (AP) \u2014 India\u2019s next prime minister, Narendra Modi, is the son of a poor tea seller who has long set his sights on the highest elected office in the world\u2019s largest democracy.\nModi grew up in a poor village family, and at 18 was married to a girl his parents had chosen five years earlier."}
