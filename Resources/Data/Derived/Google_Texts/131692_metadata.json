Earlier this week he spoke at the Cannes Lions festival, as part of the Ogilvy & Mather Inspire lecture series. There he had a strong message: If our trends, culture and value move away from innovation we stop solving some of the world\u2019s biggest problems.\n\nAd Week reports from Cannes:\n\n\u201cInstead of showing slides of star maps or X-ray images of distant galaxies, Tyson chose to feature pictures of money in his appearance at the festival\u2019s fourth annual Ogilvy & Mather Inspire lecture. He presented slide after slide of international currency that featured and honored scientists as cultural icons. Today, few such bills can be found, and Tyson fears the world is losing its admiration for science. \u201c\u2018Somebody cared enough about it to put it on the currency. These are the things that affect your culture. A whole culture can be given to problem solving simply by the forces operating within it and around it, forces you might not even be aware of while you\u2019re in the middle of it.'\u201d\n\nA historic example of this, according to Tyson, is the Islamic world at around 1000 A.D., which was at the time a petri dish of intellectual thought and discovery.\n\n\u201cMathematics, agriculture, engineering, medicine, navigation \u2014 all of that happened while Europe was disemboweling heretics at the same time,\u201d Tyson explained. \u201cSo what happened? Well, it wasn\u2019t forever.\u201d\n\nAccording to Tyson, Al-Ghazali, an influential philosopher in the early 11th century, had a different thought: \u201cmanipulating numbers was outside your spiritual accountability,\u201d Ad Week reports.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re content with everything you see as being the will of a divine force, you have been removed from the equation of all those whose curiosity leads to solutions to problems,\u201d Tyson said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Watch the famed astrophysicist discuss creativity and science -- and the forces he fears will stifle them VIDEO", "title": "Neil deGrasse Tyson: If we don\u2019t foster innovation we \u201cmight as well just move back into the cave\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Watch the famed astrophysicist discuss creativity and science -- and the forces he fears will stifle them VIDEO", "title": "Neil deGrasse Tyson: If we don\u2019t foster innovation we \u201cmight as well just move back into the cave\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/20/neil_degrasse_tyson_if_we_dont_foster_innovation_we_might_as_well_just_move_back_into_the_cave/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/Screen-Shot-2014-06-20-at-10.58.34-AM.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Watch the famed astrophysicist discuss creativity and science -- and the forces he fears will stifle them VIDEO", "title": "Neil deGrasse Tyson: If we don\u2019t foster innovation we \u201cmight as well just move back into the cave\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/Screen-Shot-2014-06-20-at-10.58.34-AM.png", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sarah Gray", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, creativity, ideas, innovation, Neil degrasse Tyson, Science, Video", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: creativity, ideas, innovation, Neil degrasse Tyson, Science, Video, Innovation NewsNeil deGrasse Tyson isn\u2019t just championing science education, and climate change action, he\u2019s also focusing on creativity and innovation.\nHe presented slide after slide of international currency that featured and honored scientists as cultural icons.\nToday, few such bills can be found, and Tyson fears the world is losing its admiration for science.\n\u201cMathematics, agriculture, engineering, medicine, navigation \u2014 all of that happened while Europe was disemboweling heretics at the same time,\u201d Tyson explained.\nThere he had a strong message: If our trends, culture and value move away from innovation we stop solving some of the world\u2019s biggest problems."}
