The class also tried to convince students to abstain from sex completely. The Alberta Human Rights Commission accepted the complaint, filed by both Dawson and her mother, Kathy.\n\n\u201cIt was based on value-based teachings, instead of scientific fact,\u201d Emily Dawson told CBC News. \u201cThey basically said that condoms were ineffective and they did not at all talk about the combined methods to protect ourselves during sexual intercourse.\u201d She said this was all \u201chighly disappointing.\u201d\n\nIn a Facebook post, the Edmonton Public Schools Board stated:\n\nI took immediate steps to look into the Pregnancy Care Centre\u2019s presentation on sex ed. I had staff members, one of whom was a registered nurse, attend and observe the presentation unannounced. They found that the presentation met our standards and expectations on every level \u2014 information was presented in a scientifically-sound way\u2026 Having said that, we\u2019ve heard a lot of concerns expressed from the public over the last several days about guest speakers invited to present on the topic of sexual health education\u2026 We are asking our schools in the fall to use different presenters so that we can continue this conversation, and focus on meeting the needs of students and parents.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Edmonton Pregnancy Care Centre (PCC) sees the situation differently. Executive director Norah Kennedy says it\u2019s \u201cfear-based.\u201d She told CBC News: \u201cI think that an individual who decides she\u2019s going to just go after something can cause fear to happen.\u201d Both Edmonton\u2019s PCC and the Calgary PCC are associated with Care-Net, a Christian group that is anti-abortion. \u201cWhile we have a faith background, the religious part does not come up in the public school or education,\u201d Jutta Wittmeier, director of the Calgary PCC, said. \u201cThat\u2019s just not part of the program, it\u2019s science- and research-based.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), 82 percent of teen pregnancies are unplanned or premature. That could possibly be attributed to a lack of sexual health education in the U.S., with up to 40 percent of teenagers not using condoms during sex, according to a CDC survey done in 2013. Up to half of the 19 million new STD cases, meanwhile, occur in young people aged 15-24 years old.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "sex education, contraception, mcnally high school", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A teenager at a high school in Edmonton, Canada filed a human rights complaint after experiencing a sex education workshop that claimed condoms were ineffective.", "title": "School Teaches Abstinence-Only Sex Ed, Teenage Girl Files Human Rights Complaint [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/teenage-girl-stops-school-teaching-abstinence-only-value-based-sex-ed-instead-scientific-facts", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/15/abstinence.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A teenager at a high school in Edmonton, Canada filed a human rights complaint after experiencing a sex education workshop that claimed condoms were ineffective.", "title": "School Teaches Abstinence-Only Sex Ed, Teenage Girl Files Human Rights Complaint [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/teenage-girl-stops-school-teaching-abstinence-only-value-based-sex-ed-instead-scientific-facts", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/15/abstinence.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/15/abstinence.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-07-15T18:00:27-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-15T18:00:26-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A teenager at a high school in Edmonton, Canada filed a human rights complaint after experiencing a sex education workshop that claimed condoms were ineffective."}, "article_summary": "The complaint states that the class, which is taught by the Edmonton Pregnancy Care Centre at McNally, taught false information about contraception, sexually-transmitted diseases, and sex in general.\nMcNally High School in Edmonton, Canada provided students with an abstinence-only sex education workshop that rubbed 18-year-old Emily Dawson the wrong way \u2014 to the point of her filing a human rights complaint over it.\n\u201cIt was based on value-based teachings, instead of scientific fact,\u201d Emily Dawson told CBC News.\nUp to half of the 19 million new STD cases, meanwhile, occur in young people aged 15-24 years old.\nThe class also tried to convince students to abstain from sex completely."}
