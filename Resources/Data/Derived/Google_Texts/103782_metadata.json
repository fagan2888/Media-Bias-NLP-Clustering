For your perusal, Politico Magazine has collected a small sampling from this salvo of SOTU press releases. (Yep, we read them all so you didn\u2019t have to.) This is what the State of the Union does to an inbox.\n\n***\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n10:28 a.m.: SOTU/\u2019Here\u2019s hoping for something different tonight\u2019, from Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.)\n\n\u201cHe could ask members of both parties to help him make 2014 a real year of action, rather than just a talking point. If he does, he\u2019s going to find he has a lot of support from Republicans. Because we want to work with him to get things done\u2014we always have.\u201d\n\n11:00 a.m.: SOTU Preview: The Obama, Warner Economy, from the Republican Party of Virginia\n\n\u201cA significant snowstorm is on its way into Virginia. \u2026 Unfortunately for many Virginians, that means they\u2019ll be stuck at home with little to watch on TV except re-runs\u2014 including the worst re-run of all, Barack Obama\u2019s State of the Union speech.\u201d\n\n11:35 a.m.: Contract Workers, Members of Congress Statements on Executive Order\n\n\u201cLuis Chiliquinga, a 65 year-old McDonald\u2019s Smithsonian Air & Space Museum worker, who earns $8.32 an hour said, \u201cAfter risking it all to go on strike for a fair wage, I\u2019m proud to have a President who will stand-up for a living wage because the workers themselves decided to take a stand.\u201d\n\n12:49 p.m.: SOTU: Embargoed statement & law experts available\n\n\u201cI just wanted to send you a friendly reminder that some experts from George Mason University School of Law are available to provide insights into what the President addresses tonight during the State of the Union.\u201d\n\n1:07 p.m.: President Should Address Obamacare Failings in SOTU Address, from the Office of Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.)\n\n4:06 p.m.: WHITFIELD STATEMENT ON TONIGHT\u2019S STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS\n\n\u201cWhile I recognize climate change may be an issue some people care about, the President\u2019s extreme actions on the matter are of little comfort to those who cannot find a job and are worried about how they are going to make ends meet.\u201d\n\n4:08 p.m.: Kirk and Manchin Statement on Attending the State of the Union Together\n\n\u201cTonight we will be sitting together at the State of the Union Address not only as best friends, but as a Democrat and a Republican who are working together on behalf of our nation. Together we joined the bipartisan No Labels Problem Solvers coalition to try and find common ground on our nation\u2019s top priorities.\u201d\n\n4:15 p.m.: \u201cState of the Uterus\u201d Speech to Address This Year\u2019s Anti-Woman Legislation\n\n\u201cThe state of our uterus is in the hands of so many,\u201d Madam Uterus will say, according to the text of her prepared remarks, attached and embargoed until 8:57 PM ET. (Note to reporters: subject to last-minute change or off-the-cuff improvisation!) \u201cAs the old saying goes, behind every successful uterus is a man calling her a whore while cutting her pay.\u201d\n\n4:18 p.m.: MEDIA ALERT: Immigration And Customs Enforcement (ICE) Council President On State of the Union, House Republican Immigration Principles\n\n\u201cAccording to news accounts, the President has once again invited illegal immigrants to the State of the Union \u2013 and yet the President still refuses to meet with ICE officers.\u201d\n\n4:20 p.m.: Farmworkers and Advocates to Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers: Be Bold on Immigration Reform\n\n\u201cIn October last year, McMorris Rodgers promised to make immigration reform a \u201cpriority\u201d for 2013 , but failed to keep her word.\u201d\n\n4:27 p.m.: DO NOT SHARE - Draft remarks State of the Union, from the Republican National Committee\n\n\u201cAnd let me just add, for no particular reason at all, most certainly not a book, that Vice President Biden has been on the right side of all foreign policy decisions\u2014even if someone else, I don\u2019t know who, says otherwise.\u201d http://www.gop.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Obamas-Leaked-SOTU-Draft-2014.pdf\n\n5:24 p.m.: National Retail Federation [The Voice of Retail Worldwide] Says Minimum Wage Hike Would Bring \u2018Minimum Opportunities\u2019\n\n6:18 p.m.: EMBARGOED UNTIL THE CONLUSION OF THE STATE OF THE UNION: Bennie Thompson Press Update: THOMPSON STATEMENT ON PRESIDENT OBAMA\u2019S STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS\n\n***9:15 Obama begins his speech***\n\n9:35 p.m.: Obama Downplays Trade Authority, Trans-Pacific Partnership: Fleeting Mention Doesn\u2019t Even Reference Recently Introduced Camp-Baucus Fast Track Bill, from Public Citizen\n\n\u201cOpposition has been growing to the massive Trans-Pacific Partnership deal. Implementing this NAFTA-on-steroids deal would undermine Obama\u2019s efforts to battle income inequality. It would be like drilling a hole in a boat just as you are trying to seal the cracks that are letting the water in.\u201d\n\n9:50 p.m.: Greenpeace reaction to State of the Union address\n\n\u201cIf you want to bend history in one direction, you need to pick a side and put your all into it.

What happened? My small home town of Rindge, NH ran a program, why can\u2019t the federal government replicate and expand such a non-controversial effort?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO Magazine", "description": "What Washington's PR-industrial complex wants you to know about the president's speech.", "title": "The State of Our Inbox", "url": "http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/01/state-of-the-union-press-releases-102826.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/01/29/140129_ralph_stateofinbox2_p.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "State Of The Union,President Obama,Media,Politics", "twitter": {"site": "@politicomag", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politicomag"}, "description": "What Washington's PR-industrial complex wants you to know about the president's speech.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0710\"", "article_summary": "This is what the State of the Union does to an inbox.\nFor your perusal, Politico Magazine has collected a small sampling from this salvo of SOTU press releases.\nMy small home town of Rindge, NH ran a program, why can\u2019t the federal government replicate and expand such a non-controversial effort?\u201d\nThere are love letters (Barbara Boxer), hate mail (Steve Stockman), disappointed epistles from long-suffering players (Greenpeace).\nBy 10:35 p.m.\u2014we\u2019ll call it \u201cpeak press release\u201d\u2014the emails, heralded by all-caps subject lines promising \u201csuccinct\u201d commentary, were streaming in faster than we could count\u2014Who got snubbed?"}
