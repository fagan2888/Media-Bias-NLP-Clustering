A robbery involving a knife in suburban Elmwood Park may be connected to a string of similar incidents in Chicago.

The latest attack happened Wednesday afternoon at a Great American Bagel store on the 7200 block of West North Avenue, police said.

Employees said the man placed an order, went to the restroom and then came out with a knife, grabbed an employee, and demanded money.

"He put the knife to my stomach," said employee Gloria Martinez.

Police said the attacker then got away in a red sedan with temporary license plates. They said they believe the same man may have robbed at least three other stores at knife point in the past month.

A Dunkin Donuts store in the cityâ€™s Austin neighborhood on the West Side was hit Monday morning. A Londo Mondo clothing store in Lincoln Park and the Green Goddess Boutique in Bucktown, both on the city's North Side, have also been robbed in the same manner.

The suspect is described as a 35-year-old man standing between 5 feet, 6 inches tall and 5 feet, 7 inches tall and weighing 150-230 pounds. He was seen in one robbery wearing a dark blue hooded rain coat and most recently spotted in a black jacket with red trim, red pants and black and red Nike gym shoes.

Police ask that anyone with information call Area North detectives at (312) 744-8263.
