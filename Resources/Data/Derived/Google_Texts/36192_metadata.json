Previous image Enlarge Close Next image /\n\nA federal judge blocked Obama\u2019s executive actions from going into effect, a move immigration reform advocates are calling only a \u201ctemporary setback.\u201d\n\nTexas U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen issued a temporary injunction siding with Texas and 25 other states that signed on to a lawsuit against Obama\u2019s executive actions on immigration. The White House announced that the Department of Justice is appealing the decision.\n\nThe judge\u2019s ruling was released just two days before the expanded version of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) was slated to go into effect.\n\nIt means that \u2014 until the ruling is blocked or overturned by a higher court \u2014 individuals will not be able to apply for the new programs announced by President Obama on Nov. 20, 2014. These include the expanded version of DACA, which was slated to start Wednesday, and the new program for parents of U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents, called Deferred Action for Parents of Americans (DAPA), which was expected to start in May.\n\nTogether the programs could protect over 5 million undocumented immigrants from deportation and provide them with temporary work authorization.\n\nThe Texas judge\u2019s ruling does not affect so-called Dreamers, who can still apply for (and renew) DACA under the program that was announced in 2012.\n\nThe chess game\n\nThe federal lawsuit in Texas is the latest move in a broader political chess match now being played out between Republicans and Democrats over the president\u2019s recent steps on immigration reform.\n\nSince Obama\u2019s announcement in November, Republicans have attempted to block his initiatives in Congress. But the legislation has not gotten passed the Senate (and even if it did, it would be vetoed by the president).\n\nThat left one pathway for the GOP to challenge Obama\u2019s executive actions: through the courts.\n\n\u201cAs they did in the health care fight, when they were unable to block the Affordable Care Act\u2019s implementation through legislation, Republicans have turned to the courts to resolve what really amounts to a political dispute over policy,\u201d Marshall Fitz, vice president of immigration policy at the Center for American Progress said.\n\n\u201cMake no mistake,\u201d said Fitz. \u201cThis is a partisan political attack disguised as a lawsuit.\u201d\n\nThe plaintiffs \u201csought this judge out\u201d because, Fitz said, he has \u201ca history of highly antagonistic, over-reaching, really extremist, anti-immigrant decisions.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey went judge shopping, they found their judge, they got the decision they wanted,\u201d said Frank Sharry, executive director of America\u2019s Voice, in Washington, D.C. \u201cBut reading through the decision, it is poorly argued, [rests on a] very weak basis, and it is clearly a politicized decision that is not going to survive appeals up through the court system.\u201d\n\nThe case is expected to go next to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, a three-judge panel known for its conservative bent. After that, the case would go to a full U.S. court of appeals and even potentially all the way to the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cThe wheels of justice are slow,\u201d said Fitz, \u201cbut at the end of the track, we will have confirmed legality and the program will be implemented.\u201d\n\nImmigration advocates have several reasons to be confident.\n\n\u201cThe fact is that the Obama administration has an airtight legal case,\u201d said Sharry. \u201cEvery president since President Eisenhower in the 1950s has used executive authority in the area of immigration policy to do similar things.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have the law on our side, legal precedent, historical precedent,\u201d said Sharry, \u201cand when a judge makes a decision in the future \u2014 hopefully in the coming days or weeks -- based on the law, we are confident that expanded DACA and DAPA will be able to go into effect.\u201d\n\nThe real danger is fear\n\nImmigration reform advocates say they are confident that the judge\u2019s decision will be reversed. Far more worrisome, they said, is the fear that it could generate among immigrant communities in the meantime.\n\n\u201cPart of the Republican strategy here is to introduce elements of uncertainty and controversy around this program in hopes that when it does go into effect, fewer people will sign up,\u201d said Sharry of America\u2019s Voice.\n\nHe cautioned immigrant communities \u201cnot to fall for this.\u201d\n\nSome immigrants are hesitant to apply for a program that is temporary, he said, because they are afraid that their information might be used to deport them if the program were ever overturned. But Sharry said these fears are overblown. \u201cIn my 30 years of working on immigration policy,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a temporary program taken away in a way that subjects people who\u2019ve come forward to deportation.\u201d\n\nWhat you can do now\n\nAlthough they can\u2019t apply for the new programs yet, undocumented immigrants can start getting their documents together.\n\n\u201cWe really want to emphasize the message to immigrants, their friends and families, to not despair, that everyone should continue to prepare, that people can get ready to apply for the programs as soon as this block is lifted,\u201d said Shiu-Ming Cheer, immigration attorney at National Immigration Law Center based in Los Angeles.\n\nCheer encouraged immigrants to continue to save money (the application fee for DACA and DAPA will be $465) and gather evidence that they have been in the country for the last five years. This includes proof of identity (such as a passport or matricula consular), proof of living here (such as bills, bank statements and medical records) and their criminal and immigration histories.\n\nMost importantly, Cheer said, undocumented immigrants should seek help from qualified attorneys at trusted local community organizations, not from notarios or unauthorized practitioners.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re eligible for the new DACA or DAPA, both of those programs are on hold. There is no way to apply right now,\u201d warned Sharry, \u201cso don\u2019t be fooled by scam artists promising to get you to the front of the line.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "latino, newspaper, journal, reflejos, illinois, suburbs, chicago, paddock,  voice, education, sports, opinion, health, people, business, entertainment", "description": "As the largest and longest running bilingual Latino publication in the NW Chicago Suburbs, Reflejos highlights the Latinos in our communities.", "Generator": "Sitefinity 3.7.2057.2:1", "Description": "As the largest and longest running bilingual Latino publication in the Northwest Chicago Suburbs, Reflejos highlights the Latinos in our communities."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc108\"", "article_summary": "The Texas judge\u2019s ruling does not affect so-called Dreamers, who can still apply for (and renew) DACA under the program that was announced in 2012.\nThe judge\u2019s ruling was released just two days before the expanded version of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) was slated to go into effect.\nThe ruling of Texas District federal judge Andrew Hanen does not affect so-called Dreamers, who can still apply for (and renew) DACA under the program that was announced in 2012.\nTogether the programs could protect over 5 million undocumented immigrants from deportation and provide them with temporary work authorization.\nFar more worrisome, they said, is the fear that it could generate among immigrant communities in the meantime."}
