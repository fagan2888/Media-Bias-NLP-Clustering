Rep. Chaka Fattah (D-Pa.) has stepped down from his position as top Democrat on a House Appropriations Subcommittee while he faces a federal indictment concerning dozens of political corruption charges.

House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) confirmed the move in a statement, saying Fattah has “rightly stepped down from his position.”

Fattah had been serving as ranking member on the committee that oversees funding for Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies.

“The charges in the indictment against Congressman Chaka Fattah are deeply saddening,” Pelosi said. “Congressman Fattah has been a tireless and effective advocate for America’s hard-working families across more than 20 years of distinguished service in the House.”

The Justice Department made the announcement on Wednesday that Fattah was indicted on 29 federal counts that include bribery, money laundering, multiple counts of bank fraud and falsification of records. The charges related to his unsuccessful run for mayor of Philadelphia in 2007.

Caucus rules require that Fattah step aside from his leadership position on the Appropriations panel, according to a Democratic aide.

Rep. Mike Honda (D-Calif.), the next most senior Democrat on the subcommittee, would become the ranking member in the meantime.
