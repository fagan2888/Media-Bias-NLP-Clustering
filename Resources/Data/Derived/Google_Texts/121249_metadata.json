Despite the fact that the vast majority of my home state abides by an abstinence-only sex education program \u2014 one that is medically inaccurate at best and psychologically damaging at worst \u2014 I managed to escape the common horrors of sex ed, thanks to a health teacher who had little regard for the board of education. Still, even though my sex education did include mention of condoms, hormonal birth control, STI treatment and (gasp!) the possibility of sexual intercourse outside marriage, it was conspicuously lacking in the consent department. There was no talk of \u201cyes\u201d meaning \u201cyes\u201d or even of \u201cno\u201d meaning \u201cno\u201d; we just didn\u2019t discuss what it means for two people to willfully engage in a consensual sexual act.\n\nI came to understand consent in the aftermath of a manipulative and abusive relationship I had with one of my teachers when I was 14. Granted, my sex education class happened after that \u2014 a problem in itself \u2014 and so it would be difficult to suggest that my abuse resulted directly from my lack of knowledge about consent. Except, not really. There were plenty of other factors that contributed to my detrimental and ultimately non-consensual relationship, but certainly my inability to recognize consent (or a lack thereof) was one of them.\n\nTeaching consent is often decried as being overly difficult and full of gray areas, especially given the all-too-common \u201cno means no\u201d understanding of what constitutes rape. These excuses are cop outs. Affirmative consent policies and open dialogue about rape \u2014 simple acts of naming and description \u2014 help to provide clarity that is necessary to promote healthy sexual behavior. It\u2019s really not that hard \u2014 and if you want a handy, artful guide, here\u2019s a beautiful poem that quite clearly explains just what is consent.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Public schools often fail to teach students about consent.
