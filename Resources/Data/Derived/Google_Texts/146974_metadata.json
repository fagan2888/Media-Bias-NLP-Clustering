In the clip, Stuart Shepard explains to CitizenLink President Tom Minnery that when there\u2019s a \u201ctie\u201d between Christians and other people that are protected, the Christians \u201close.\u201d Among his examples is the Oregon bakery that was found in violation of state law for refusing to provide a wedding cake to a same-sex couple:\n\nSHEPARD: Here\u2019s a cake baker in Oregon. Two women asked them to make a cake for their wedding. The Christian owners said they could not use their artistic ability to make a one-of-a-kind cake to celebrate something they do not support. The state pointed to the civil rights law that was amendment a few years ago to include orientation and said the Christians lose\u2026 The Oregon civil rights law also lists religion as a protected class, but activists are leveraging those laws to push Christians right out of business. When it\u2019s a tie, the Christians lose.\n\nShepard goes on to cite the Affordable Care Act\u2019s birth control provision as another supposed example of discrimination against Christians. Watch it:\n\nShepard is right that religion is a protected class in Oregon, but he\u2019s wrong about what that entitles Christians to. Oregon\u2019s law applies only in specific contexts, such as employment, housing, and public accommodations \u2014 the latter being the relevant one to the bakery. A public store-front business is a public accommodation, and so it is illegal to provide wedding cakes to straight couples and not to gay couples. Similarly, it would be illegal to provide wedding cakes to Jewish couples and not Christian couples, and in such a case, the Christian couple would be protected by the same law. Therefore, both classes are protected equally. There is no protection in the law related to how to run a business.\n\nWhat Focus on the Family\u2019s political action arm is calling a \u201ctie\u201d is actually a false comparison. This was not a case of gay people vs. Christians to see who wins \u2014 it was a case about making sure that all people are treated equally and offered the same protection under the law. The same is true of women, whose access to health care should not be determined by the religious whims of the owner of the business they might work for. These false conflicts \u2014 between Christians and the gay community and between Christians and women \u2014 ignore the intersectionality of these identities, instead attempting to portray one particular group of conservative Christians as victims.\n\nWhat organizations like Focus on the Family actually seem to want is not a game where the rules are fair, but one in which they always get their way.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Focus on the Family is right that religion is often a protected class, but they're wrong about that entitling Christians to discriminate against others.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Focus on the Family is right that religion is often a protected class, but they're wrong about that entitling Christians to discriminate against others.", "title": "Focus On The Family: Nondiscrimination Protections Discriminate Against Christians", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/lgbt/2014/01/24/3202711/focus-family-nondiscrimination-protections-discriminate-christians/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Focus-on-the-Family-RPS.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Focus on the Family is right that religion is often a protected class, but they're wrong about that entitling Christians to discriminate against others.", "creator": "@ZackFord", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Focus-on-the-Family-RPS-321x214.jpg", "title": "Focus On The Family: Nondiscrimination Protections Discriminate Against Christians", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-lgbt", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Focus-on-the-Family-RPS.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Focus-on-the-Family-RPS.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-24T11:01:02+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/zackford"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2053\"", "article_summary": "LGBT Focus On The Family: Nondiscrimination Protections Discriminate Against Christians CREDIT: YouTube.\nIn a new video in its Stoplight series, Focus on the Family\u2019s CitizenLink outlet has revealed its backward understanding of nondiscrimination protections that are LGBT-inclusive.\nThese false conflicts \u2014 between Christians and the gay community and between Christians and women \u2014 ignore the intersectionality of these identities, instead attempting to portray one particular group of conservative Christians as victims.\nWatch it:Shepard is right that religion is a protected class in Oregon, but he\u2019s wrong about what that entitles Christians to.\nShepard goes on to cite the Affordable Care Act\u2019s birth control provision as another supposed example of discrimination against Christians."}
