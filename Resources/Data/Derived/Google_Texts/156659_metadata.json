And the resulting narrowing of inequality helped support faster and more durable growth.\u201d\n\nThe two charts below help illustrate the relationship between inequality and GDP growth (on the left), and redistribution and GDP growth (on the right). The authors note a \u201cstrong negative relationship\u201d between inequality and growth \u2013 as inequality increases, growth numbers decline. Turning to the redistribution chart, the nearly-flat line indicates a weak (and if anything, positive) relationship between redistributive policies and GDP.\n\nSo what does this all mean for policymakers? That\u2019s the subject of today\u2019s report. IMF economists examined a number of fiscal policy interventions that would reduce inequality with minimal or non-existent negative impacts on GDP growth. The report is less of a policy prescription and more of a menu of options for would-be equality reformers. Among their suggestions:\n\nRaise the retirement age for pension plans (think Social Security) and means-test them \u2013 that is, gradually phase out benefits for higher wage earners.\n\nShorten the maximum time allowed for collecting unemployment benefits, to encourage return to work or transition to other safety net services.\n\nImprove access to education for low-income families, particularly college education.\n\nImprove access to health services for low-income families.\n\nImplement more progressive income tax rate structures.\n\nReform personal income tax exemptions and deductions, particularly the mortgage interest deduction.\n\nThere are policy suggestions in the report that will appeal to both conservatives and liberals. The Obama administration, for instance, can use the emphasis on expanded access to healthcare to bolster support for the Affordable Care Act. Conservatives will cheer the call for reduced unemployment benefit duration.\n\nThe important thing to keep in mind is that if the IMF\u2019s conclusions are correct \u2013 and they have an awful lot of data to back up their claims \u2013 these policy interventions can be undertaken with no negative impact on GDP. In the authors\u2019 words, it\u2019s \u201ca win-win.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Two new studies are absolutely unequivocal that redistribution is overall pro-growth.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/chrisingraham", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Two new studies are absolutely unequivocal that redistribution is overall pro-growth.", "title": "Obama was right: To boost the economy, spread the wealth", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/03/13/obama-was-right-to-boost-the-economy-spread-the-wealth/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/files/2014/03/inequality.png&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@_cingraham"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/03/13/obama-was-right-to-boost-the-economy-spread-the-wealth/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "inequality, opportunity, gdp growth, redistribution, income,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/chrisingraham"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "inequality, opportunity, gdp growth, redistribution, income,"}, "article_summary": "The authors note a \u201cstrong negative relationship\u201d between inequality and growth \u2013 as inequality increases, growth numbers decline.\nAnd the resulting narrowing of inequality helped support faster and more durable growth.\u201dThe two charts below help illustrate the relationship between inequality and GDP growth (on the left), and redistribution and GDP growth (on the right).\nIMF economists examined a number of fiscal policy interventions that would reduce inequality with minimal or non-existent negative impacts on GDP growth.\nThe Obama administration, for instance, can use the emphasis on expanded access to healthcare to bolster support for the Affordable Care Act.\nTurning to the redistribution chart, the nearly-flat line indicates a weak (and if anything, positive) relationship between redistributive policies and GDP."}
