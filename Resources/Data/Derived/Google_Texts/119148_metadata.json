Those fees often amount to hundreds of dollars per year.\n\nUnions can\u2019t spend agency fees directly on politics, but taking fees from nonmembers frees unions to spend more from members\u2019 dues on political activism for \u201cprogressive,\u201d big-government policies.\n\nAgency fees inflate union membership, as well \u2014 workers who want to opt out must consider they\u2019ll have to pay the union regardless of whether they join.\n\nUnions shouldn\u2019t be allowed to take fees from nonmembers, Matt Patterson, director of the Center for Worker Freedom at Americans for Tax Reform, said in an email to Watchdog.\n\n\u201cSo called \u2018agency fees\u2019 are just another way to force workers to associate with unions in flagrant violation of those workers\u2019 First Amendment freedoms of speech and assembly,\u201d Patterson said.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s an idea: Instead of the government-enforced representation/fees collection, how about unions only represent workers who want their services, and workers only pay for the services they want.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s called the free market, and in 21st century America it\u2019s a radical notion only among Big Labor and its allies.\u201d\n\nUnions insist agency fees are needed to cover representation costs for nonmembers; union leaders could lobby for members-only contracts with employers, but they prefer fighting right-to-work laws instead.\n\nWhile the agency fees taken from 554,799 workers can\u2019t directly be spent on politics, they can help pump up six-figure union boss paychecks. Excluding pro sports unions, 497 union officers and employees were paid more than $250,000 last year.\n\nRight-to-work threatens a system allowing unions to spend huge sums on union pay, politics and organizing \u2014 with little concern about whether workers agree with union priorities.\n\nWisconsin\u2019s 2011 Act 10 reforms freed most public employees from agency fees, and Wisconsin passed a private-sector right-to-work law this spring. Indiana and Michigan enacted right-to-work laws in 2012.\n\nDespite the trend toward right-to-work, in many states workers \u2014 and taxpayers \u2014 are still forced to fund labor unions. Mandatory fees were taken from the paychecks of hundreds of thousands of teachers and government workers in 2014.\n\nService Employees International Union had about 1 million public-sector and 900,000 private-sector members last year, and it took agency fees from 176,969 nonmembers.\n\nAmerican Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees took agency fees from 125,255 government workers refusing to join AFSCME.\n\nNational Education Association took agency fees from 90,255 teachers and other school employees.\n\nAmerican Federation of Teachers\u2019 headquarters in Washington, D.C., reported no agency fee payers, but multiple state AFT chapters took forced fees. New York State United Teachers, the largest AFT affiliate, took agency fees from 23,365 nonmembers.\n\nAFT affiliate California Federation of Teachers reported 12,212 agency fee payers and only 55,647 willing union members. Illinois Federation of Teachers had 92,364 members and took forced fees from 8,216 nonmembers.\n\nAmerican Association of University Professors\u2019 headquarters in D.C. had more than one forced fee payer for every four members, with 38,388 members and 11,106 agency fee payers.\n\nHalf a million\u2019s a big number, but it\u2019s likely even more workers were forced to pay unions in 2014. Not all public-sector unions disclose their total number of agency fee payers to the U.S. Department of Labor.\n\nBecause federal reporting requirements exempt unions with no private-sector members, many AFT and AFSCME affiliates don\u2019t file reports detailing spending, revenue, membership or agency fee payer figures.", "article_metadata": {"description": "More than half a million workers were forced to pay labor unions in 2014, U.S. Department of Labor filings reveal.", "og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "More than half a million workers were forced to pay labor unions in 2014, U.S. Department of Labor filings reveal.", "title": "Labor unions take forced fees from 550,000 nonmembers - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/04/seiu-twitter-2015-04-22.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-04-29T15:12:14+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/214152/unions-forced-fees/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "More than half a million workers were forced to pay labor unions in 2014, U.S. Department of Labor filings reveal.", "title": "Labor unions take forced fees from 550,000 nonmembers - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/04/seiu-twitter-2015-04-22.jpg"}, "creator": "@jasonahart", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Labor", "published_time": "2015-04-27T04:00:30+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-29T15:12:14+00:00"}, "news_keywords": "agency fees, union fees, forced unionism, right-to-work, fair share fees, union dues, mandatory union dues, SEIU, AFSCME"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe21e0\"", "article_summary": "Unions can\u2019t spend agency fees directly on politics, but taking fees from nonmembers frees unions to spend more from members\u2019 dues on political activism for \u201cprogressive,\u201d big-government policies.\nIllinois Federation of Teachers had 92,364 members and took forced fees from 8,216 nonmembers.\nTo keep their jobs, 554,799 American workers were forced last year to pay union agency fees.\nAmerican Federation of Teachers\u2019 headquarters in Washington, D.C., reported no agency fee payers, but multiple state AFT chapters took forced fees.\nNew York State United Teachers, the largest AFT affiliate, took agency fees from 23,365 nonmembers."}
