SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) — Soldiers were sent to clear ash from towns and roads near Chile’s Calbuco volcano, which was quieter but continued to release columns of ash days after emitting twin spectacular eruptions.

Late Sunday, Chile’s National Geology and Mining Service said rainfall in the coming days could cause dangerous lahars, mudflows of debris, pyroclastic material and water that would flow down the volcano’s slopes and through valleys. Experts also said they feared the rain could cause the thick layer of volcanic ash to harden in place.

About 400 soldiers arrived in the region to help residents clean the ash off roofs and from streets and properties.

The area looks like a “gray desert,” said 45-year-old local Victor Hugo Toledo.

“Wherever you look all you see is gray dust; there is an average of 50 centimeters off it over the towns and on all the roofs,” he said.
