Mr. Goddard, in response to that, put out a snarky tweet: \u201cGov. Scott Walker\u2019s office was unable to provide any transcripts of his conversations with God,\u201d The Daily Caller reported.\n\nAfter receiving critical Twitter replies from those in the know about the Christian faith who pointed out that Mr. Walker\u2019s belief was actually very common, Mr. Goddard still dug down, writing in another tweet: \u201cI don\u2019t pretend I can talk with God. But perhaps Scott Walker can,\u201d The Daily Caller reported.\n\nHe finally put out a more serious tweet, to a couple of his critics, writing: \u201cSerious question: Can you divine God\u2019s will from that prayer? Scott Walker says he\u2019s trying to. I\u2019m not sure he can.\u201d\n\nAfter receiving the reply \u2014 yes, that\u2019s how Christians think, and it\u2019s called discernment \u2014 Mr. Goddard then quieted his sarcasm a bit, tweeting: \u201cI find it interesting when politicians say they get guidance from God.
