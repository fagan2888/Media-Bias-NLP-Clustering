Worth more than $100 million, the bill would fund national programs instead of targeting the city\u2019s drinking water crisis, he complained.\n\nEdwards characterized the bill as \u201cjust spreading [money] around so many different government agencies, who frankly\u2026don\u2019t even have Flint\u2019s best interests at heart.\u201d\n\nBipartisan supporters, including both Michigan senators, call the legislation critical.\n\nSen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., said the bill would \u201cnot only help the families of Flint, but make a critical investment in cities across the country.\u201d And Stabenow maintains that it would be fully funded and wouldn\u2019t increase spending \u201cby one penny.\u201d\n\nSen. Mike Lee, R-Utah., disagrees and has placed a hold on the bill, temporarily blocking the legislation. So far, Lee is the only senator to do so publicly.\n\n>>> Here\u2019s Why Mike Lee Opposes Federal Aid for Flint\n\nThe Utah Republican argues that the Flint crisis is a \u201cman-made disaster\u201d that Michigan is best off cleaning up on its own.\n\n\u201cMichigan has an enormous budget surplus this year and a large rainy-day fund,\u201d Lee said Friday. \u201cRelief and repair efforts are already in the works. The people and policymakers of Michigan right now have all the government resources they need to fix the problem.\u201d\n\nThe Great Lake State is far from high and dry.\n\nMichigan has squirreled away $386 million in an emergency fund and collected a $575 million surplus in 2015. Gov. Rick Snyder, a Republican, has already requested $200 million in relief funds from the state legislature for Flint.\n\nPresident Barack Obama declared a state of emergency in Flint in January, later authorizing more than $80 million in aid, and has instructed the Federal Emergency Management Agency to assist in the cleanup effort.\n\nAt this point, Lee said, \u201c[t]he only thing Congress is contributing to the Flint recovery is political grandstanding.\u201d\n\nFlint represents a cost-cutting episode gone awry. Under financial pressure, the city manager opted to switch water sources to reduce spending. Instead of piping Lake Huron water in from Detroit, officials tapped the Flint River in early 2014.\n\nShortly after, untreated water flowing through old lead pipes brought contamination into the homes of Flint residents. In September 2015, Edwards and a team from Virginia Tech reported that the city \u201chas a very serious lead in water problem.\u201d\n\nForty percent of homes had elevated lead levels in their drinking water, according to the Virginia Tech Report.\n\nEvens small amounts of lead, according to the Mayo Clinic, can create big problems. Exposure increases the risk of mental and physical development in children\u2014especially in young infants.\n\nBut Lee says that Michigan has the tools to being the catastrophe to a close.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s really happening here is that Washington politicians are using the crisis,\u201d Lee wrote \u201cas an excuse to funnel taxpayer money to their own home states, and trying to sneak it through the Senate without proper debate and amendment. I respectfully object.\u201d\n\nLee\u2019s hold isn\u2019t final. It can be bypassed through parliamentary maneuvering. But if that happens, an aide told The Daily Signal that the senator is considering a filibuster to bring the measure to a second halt.\n\nStabenow expressed disbelief that Lee would continue to slow the measure.\n\n\u201cI am extremely surprised that Sen. Lee would be holding up a bipartisan bill that would help communities across the country,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIf Sen. Lee opposes the bipartisan bill that is fully paid for he should vote against it, but he should not block it from even getting a vote.\u201d\n\nLee\u2019s office reject the numbers propping up Stabenow\u2019s math. The funds for Flint would be redirected from the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing loan program, but that wouldn\u2019t occur until 2020. By then, Lee projects, the funds will be gone.", "article_metadata": {"description": "They're not letting a crisis go to waste.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "They're not letting a crisis go to waste.", "title": "Mike Lee: D.C.
