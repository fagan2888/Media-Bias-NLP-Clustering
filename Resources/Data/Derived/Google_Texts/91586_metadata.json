Many feared that the regulation would eventually become mandatory and be used to target politically unpopular nonprofits.\n\nThe framework was intended to \u201cminimize the reporting burden\u201d for nonprofits and to \u201cprotect donor privacy by not using the Form 990 series,\u201d the IRS and the Treasury explained. But after receiving nearly 38,000 public comments, many of them critical, the government decided to walk back its effort.\n\n\u201cThe Treasury Department and the IRS received a substantial number of public comments in response to the notice of proposed rulemaking,\u201d Karen Schiller, acting deputy commissioner for Services and Enforcement, said in documents withdrawing the proposal. \u201cAccordingly, the notice of proposed rulemaking is being withdrawn.\u201d\n\nCritics, including the Tea Party Patriots, worried that collecting donors\u2019 Social Security numbers could lead to widespread abuse.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen that the IRS has successfully targeted organizations, and employees of the IRS have abused the power of the agency against people they perceive as political opponents,\u201d Martin, co-founder of Tea Party Patriots, told The Daily Signal in an earlier interview. \u201cHaving more information about who supports those organizations would give them the potential to continue the abuse of power and hurt the individuals, not just the groups. That\u2019s the danger of it.\u201d\n\nTim Delaney, president and CEO of the National Council of Nonprofits, also rallied against the effort, arguing the rule could have a chilling effect on donors.\n\n\u201cNonprofits have neither the financial resources nor sufficient staffing to combat hackers who will see an easy source for Social Security information,\u201d he said. \u201cThis also creates a liability nightmare for innocent nonprofits. \u2026 To be asked to share their address, their credit card number and their Social Security number all in the same place would be enough to scare even the most committed donor to decline to give.\u201d\n\nToday, Delaney said, is a \u201cgood day\u201d for the American public.\n\n\u201cToday is a good day for the public, for donors to the work of charitable nonprofits, and for the nonprofit community,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Treasury Department and the IRS wisely withdrew their proposed gift substantiation rules after hearing from almost 38,000 Americans who filed comments in opposition to the proposal.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The IRS withdrew a proposal that would give nonprofits the option of collecting personal information, including the Social Security numbers, from donors.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The IRS withdrew a proposal that would give nonprofits the option of collecting personal information, including the Social Security numbers, from donors.", "title": "IRS Won\u2019t Ask Nonprofits to Collect Social Security Numbers", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/jmpphotos022061-cropped.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-01-08T11:56:20+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1Zd6Seq"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The IRS withdrew a proposal that would give nonprofits the option of collecting personal information, including the Social Security numbers, from donors.", "title": "IRS Won\u2019t Ask Nonprofits to Collect Social Security Numbers", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/jmpphotos022061-cropped.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "taxes", "published_time": "2016-01-07T17:06:23+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-08T11:56:20+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "irs, irs rule, irs nonprofit, irs 501c3, irs social security numbers, irs targeting, tea party patriots, Treasury Department, Tea Party Patriots"}, "article_summary": "\u201cPresident Obama\u2019s IRS is abandoning its blatantly heavy-handed regulation to ask charities to disclose the Social Security numbers of donors giving $250 or more annually.\u201dThe rule, proposed in September 2014, would give nonprofits the option to collect the Social Security numbers of donors who contribute $250 or more to an organization.\n\u201cAccordingly, the notice of proposed rulemaking is being withdrawn.\u201dCritics, including the Tea Party Patriots, worried that collecting donors\u2019 Social Security numbers could lead to widespread abuse.\n\u201cNonprofits have neither the financial resources nor sufficient staffing to combat hackers who will see an easy source for Social Security information,\u201d he said.\nOn Thursday, the Internal Revenue Service and the Treasury Department withdrew a proposal that would give nonprofits the option of collecting personal information, including the Social Security numbers, from its donors.\n\u201cToday is a good day for the public, for donors to the work of charitable nonprofits, and for the nonprofit community,\u201d he said."}
