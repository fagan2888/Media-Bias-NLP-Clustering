And if there\u2019s a time to get lost, it\u2019s on National Book Lovers Day.\n\nToday, bookworms are invited to read away as much of the day as they possibly can. The New York Public Library even has a cool campaign, from now until August 15, that exposes some of the best-kept places to read by using their hashtag #ireadeverywhere.\n\nBut books aren\u2019t just exciting to get into. They boast some health benefits, too.\n\nLiterary Fiction Improves Theory Of Mind\n\nA study published in the journal Science recruited 800 people to read excerpts from either literary fiction (The Roundhouse by Louise Eldrich) or popular fiction (Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn). It didn\u2019t matter how little or how often each person read: Researchers found reading literary fiction essentially made it easier for a person to empathize.\n\nScientifically, this is known as theory of mind, in which a person has a strong ability to infer someone else\u2019s thoughts and feelings. The more a person reads (authors argue that it doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be literary fiction), the stronger their theory of mind.\n\nReaders Are More Intelligent\n\nAccording to research from the University of California, Berkeley, published in the Journal of Direct Instruction, reading promotes literacy. The increased exposure to a variety of vocabulary helps to boost both memory and cognitive skills. And in a separate study published in the journal Child Development, researchers found not developing reading skills early-one negatively affected identical twins.\n\n\"Children who don't receive enough assistance in learning to read may also be missing out on the important, intelligence-boosting properties of literacy,\u201d Stuart J. Richie, lead study author, said in a press release.\n\nBook Interventions Benefit Depression, Disabled Children\n\nSelf-help books are recommended as an intervention for severely depressed patients, found a BMJ study. Similarly, a small study from the University of Cincinatti found bibliotherapy, or the idea of using books as an intervention, benefitted children who struggled socially as a result of a disability, including autism and Downs Syndrome.\n\nBooks Are Means Of Transportation\n\nKing wasn\u2019t kidding. Research from Emory University in Atlanta found a person sustains measurable changes in their brain up to five days after reading.\n\n\"The neural changes that we found associated with physical sensation and movement systems suggest that reading a novel can transport you into the body of the protagonist,\" Gregory Berns, lead study author, told The Independent. says. \"We already knew that good stories can put you in someone else's shoes in a figurative sense. Now we're seeing that something may also be happening biologically.\"\n\nReading Can Change Your Life\n\nIn her 2013 TED Talk, Lisa Bu told the audience she wanted to be a Chinese opera singer growing up. No one, not even her parents, supported this idea \u2014 so Bu turned to books to find a new calling.\n\n\"Books have given me a magic portal to connect with people of the past and the present,\" she said during her talk. \"I know I shall never feel lonely or powerless again. Having a dream shattered really is nothing compared to what many others have suffered. I have come to believe that coming true is not the only purpose of a dream. Its most important purpose is to get us in touch with where dreams come from, where passion comes from, where happiness comes from. Even a shattered dream can do that for you.\"", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "national, book, lovers, day, 2014, science, says, reading, makes, you, healthier", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "In honor of National Book Lovers Day, read a book for both excitement and serious health benefits.", "title": "5 Science-Backed Ways Reading Makes You Healthier", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/national-book-lovers-day-2014-science-says-reading-makes-you-healthier-297310", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/08/open-book-desk.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In honor of National Book Lovers Day, read a book for both excitement and serious health benefits.", "title": "5 Science-Backed Ways Reading Makes You Healthier", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/national-book-lovers-day-2014-science-says-reading-makes-you-healthier-297310", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/08/open-book-desk.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/08/open-book-desk.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-08-08T17:17:40-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-09T09:51:39-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "In honor of National Book Lovers Day, read a book for both excitement and serious health benefits."}, "article_summary": "It didn\u2019t matter how little or how often each person read: Researchers found reading literary fiction essentially made it easier for a person to empathize.\nAnd in a separate study published in the journal Child Development, researchers found not developing reading skills early-one negatively affected identical twins.\nLiterary Fiction Improves Theory Of MindA study published in the journal Science recruited 800 people to read excerpts from either literary fiction (The Roundhouse by Louise Eldrich) or popular fiction (Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn).\nResearch from Emory University in Atlanta found a person sustains measurable changes in their brain up to five days after reading.\nReaders Are More IntelligentAccording to research from the University of California, Berkeley, published in the Journal of Direct Instruction, reading promotes literacy."}
