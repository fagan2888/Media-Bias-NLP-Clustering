Russia\u2019s UN Ambassador Vitaly Churkin told Bloomberg News the president\u2019s promise regarding \u201csnapback sanctions\u201d if Iran cheats is essentially a pipe dream.\u201cThere can be no automaticity, none whatsoever,\u201d the Ambassador stated without elaborating.\n\nThus the president's assertion in April, \"If Iran violates the deal, sanctions can be snapped back into place,\u201d is revealed to be as reliable as his promises regarding ObamaCare. That was the same month Obama insisted restoring the international sanctions would not require a U.N. Security Council consensus, due to an informal compromise reached during negotiations in Lausanne, Switzerland. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz, who had engaged in those negotiations, echoed that assertion, insisting \"no one country could block the snapback.\u201d\n\nSuch contentions are disingenuous at best. China and Russia have long opposed UN sanctions, and there is nothing in the agreement to suggest that opposition by two Security Council members could be dismissed out of hand. Furthermore, the latest declaration by Churkin comes amidst a burgeoning alliance between China and Russia, symbolized by Russian President Vladimir Putin offering the seat next to him to Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Russian ceremony commemorating the 70th anniversary of Nazi Germany\u2019s defeat. The two nations have recently solidified their relationship with 32 separate bilateral agreements \"designed to highlight the warming of relations between the countries even as Russia\u2019s have soured with the West,\u201d as the New York Times characterizes it. In addition, the two nations have been holding first-ever joint naval drills in the Mediterranean Sea this week.\n\nThus the Obama administration\u2019s latest statement that Russia agreed \u201cin principle\u201d to the imposition of snapback sanctions\u2014for which the Russian government offered no corroboration whatsoever\u2014rings exceedingly hollow. That hollowness is buttressed by Russian deputy foreign minister Sergey Rybakov who told state-run RIA Novosti in April any reintroduction of sanctions wold require a UN Security Council vote. \u201cWe are proceeding on the basis that if one of the partners in the talks raises the possibility of sanctions being reintroduced against Iran, in the hypothetical situation that Iran should fail to honor its commitments, then this process should not in any way be automatic,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd moving from principles to practicality, it is worth remembering April is the same month the Kremlin ended a 2010 self-imposed ban, and promised to deliver a sophisticated S-300 surface-to-air missile system to the world\u2019s foremost state sponsor of terrorism. One that would would make it far more dangerous to take out Iranian nuclear facilities. Perhaps Obama believed Putin would remain passive in the face of the sanctions imposed by the United States and the European Union as punishment for his support for the rebels in Ukraine. Last March, Secretary of State John Kerry assured the world Western nations were prepared \u201cto go to the hilt\u201d to isolate Russia for its \u201cincredible act of aggression.\u201d This week Kerry is in Russia. \u201cThis trip is part of our ongoing effort to maintain direct lines of communication with senior Russian officials and to ensure U.S. views are clearly conveyed,\u201d a State Department press release explained. One suspects Putin is well aware of what the United States is after\u2014and couldn\u2019t care less.\n\nMoreover, the hits keep coming with regard to Obama's insistence last December that Iran could be \"a very successful regional power\u201d following a deal that would ultimately lead to Iran being \u201creintegrated into the international community.\u201d As revealed by Reuters, the purchase of \"a large shipment of sensitive technology useable for nuclear enrichment\u201d was thwarted by the Czech Republic when false documentation raised suspicions about the transaction.\n\nThe incident occurred in January, when Iran tried to buy compressors with both nuclear and non-nuclear applications made by Howden CKD Compressors, a U.S-owned company. Iran had attempted to make the purchase through Howden CKD in the Czech Republic. According to the latest annual report released by the expert panel for the United Nations Security Council's Iran sanctions committee, a \"false end user\u201d for the stated order precipitated the move by the Czech Republic. \"The procurer and transport company involved in the deal had provided false documentation in order to hide the origins, movement and destination of the consignment with the intention of bypassing export controls and sanctions,\u201d the report added. There was no indication Howden CKD itself was involved, but Prague-based officials of the company declined to comment.\n\nIran\u2019s Navy has also continued to manifest aggression on the high seas, firing shots across the bow of Singapore-flagged cargo ship Alpine Eternity in the Persian Gulf. Five Iranian fast boats approached the vessel in international waters and ordered it into Iranian waters. When the ship\u2019s master refused, the Iranians attempted to disable the vessel firing several shots at it, even as it retreated into UAE territorial waters. They eventually broke off pursuit. This marks the third such incident in less than a month, following aggression directed at the U.S.-flagged cargo ship Maersk Kensington, and the Marshall Islands-flagged M/V Maersk Tigris.\n\nMoreover, an Iranian ship is currently headed towards Yemen, and Iranian officials have declared that any attempt to block what they call an aid ship\u2014as opposed to one laden with arms and other supplies for Iranian-backed Houthi rebels--\u201cwill spark war in the region,\u201d according to Iranian General Massoud Jazzayeri. The Iranian Defense Ministry also lashed out at the the United States directly. \u201cThe U.S. is an accomplice to the war criminals by supporting genocide in Yemen and the Iranian people\u2019s food and drug aid is a humanitarian move to soothe the oppressed Yemeni people\u2019s pains,\u201d it stated. Iran\u2019s Fars News Agency also reported that one of its ships \u201clocked its missile systems on an invading vessel\u201d and warned the \u201cterrorists\u201d manning it \"they would be killed with the first bullets of Alborz,\u201d said Commodore Hassan Maqsoudlou, the captain of the Alborz destroyer.\n\nAll of these incidents have taken place after the deal to make a deal between Iran and the P5+1 powers was reached.\n\nIn the meantime, Iran insists that any agreement reached by the June 30 deadline would shortly thereafter precipitate a UN Security Council resolution that \u201cwill terminate all previous resolutions, including all sanctions and will set in place the termination of EU sanctions,\u201d said Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif in a speech at New York University on April 29.\n\nUnited States UN Ambassador Samatha Power had a different take, insisting the lifting of sanctions would lead only to their replacement with \u201ca mechanism\u201d keeping many of them related to weapons in place, as well as providing \u201csome kind of procurement channel\u201d to vet any \u201cdual-use\u201d acquisitions or purchases Iran wants to make,\u201c she stated in testimony to Congress on April 15. Yet Powers also emphasized the pie-in-the-sky thinking that dominates this administration, insisting it will \"secure an arrangement to allow for snapback in New York that doesn\u2019t require Russian or Chinese support.\u201d\n\nIn a speech two weeks later at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew doubled down on the individual veto smokescreen. \u201cWe have made it abundantly clear that if Iran breaks its commitment, it will face once again the full force of the multilateral sanctions regime,\u201d he said. \u201cThe snapback would not be vulnerable to a veto by an individual P5 member, including China and Russia.\u201d\n\nMatt Levitt, a former Treasury official who moderated that event, cut through such pernicious nonsense. \"No one should be fooled into thinking there will be any automaticity here,\u201d he stated. \u201cIf we thought Iran was cheating, the debate then moves to whether there was in fact a violation. You can see a situation where Russia and China will dispute whether there is in fact a violation.\u201d Given ongoing projection of American weakness embraced by this administration, coupled with a maddening level of ideologically-induced naivet\u00e9 and the president\u2019s determination to burnish his \u201chistorical\" legacy\u2014all of which from the foundation of the Obama administration\u2019s disastrous foreign policy\u2014it becomes hard to see why China and Russia wouldn\u2019t dispute any violation, no matter how egregious or transparent.\n\nFreedom Center pamphlets now available on Kindle: Click here.\n\n\n\nLIKE Frontpagemag.com on Facebook and Subscribe to Jamie Glazov Productions.", "article_metadata": {"rating": "general", "description": "Russia\u2019s UN Ambassador Vitaly Churkin blows a giant hole in President Obama\u2019s assertions.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Frontpage Mag", "description": "Russia\u2019s UN Ambassador Vitaly Churkin blows a giant hole in President Obama\u2019s assertions.", "title": "Obama's 'Snap Back' Sanctions Fantasy", "url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/fpm/257000/obamas-snap-back-sanctions-fantasy-arnold-ahlert", "updated_time": "2015-06-22T23:38:44-04:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/fpm/257000/obamas-snap-back-sanctions-fantasy-arnold-ahlert", "description": "Russia\u2019s UN Ambassador Vitaly Churkin blows a giant hole in President Obama\u2019s assertions.", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama's 'Snap Back' Sanctions Fantasy"}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-14T20:32:54-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-22T23:38:44-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca15f\"", "article_summary": "Thus the president's assertion in April, \"If Iran violates the deal, sanctions can be snapped back into place,\u201d is revealed to be as reliable as his promises regarding ObamaCare.\nPresident Barack Obama\u2019s dubious assertions regarding a nuclear deal with Iran took another hit Wednesday.\nAll of these incidents have taken place after the deal to make a deal between Iran and the P5+1 powers was reached.\nChina and Russia have long opposed UN sanctions, and there is nothing in the agreement to suggest that opposition by two Security Council members could be dismissed out of hand.\nThat hollowness is buttressed by Russian deputy foreign minister Sergey Rybakov who told state-run RIA Novosti in April any reintroduction of sanctions wold require a UN Security Council vote."}
