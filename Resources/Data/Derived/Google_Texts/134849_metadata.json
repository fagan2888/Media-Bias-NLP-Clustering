Dannel P. Malloy met with President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden during a roundtable discussion involving more than a dozen other governors as part of the National Governors Association's winter meeting.\n\nHere's the White House pool report from the gathering:\n\nThe president spoke for about 4 minutes, praising the governors for their efforts at raising minimum wages and expanding early childhood education, and enacting measures such as paid sick leave in Vermont. He said the success of the Affordable Care Act is \"thanks to the efforts of all of you.\"\n\n(Connecticut was a leader in several of these efforts, including being the first state in the country to raise the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour. Obama visited Central Connecticut State University in New Britain in 2014 to talk about that issue. And Access Health CT, the state's health insurance exchange under the Affordable Care Act, has been touted as a model for other states to follow.)\n\n\"There's one thing in particular I'm going to make a focus this year, and that's protecting everybody's right to vote. The job of our democracy is to make it easier, not harder, for our citizens to vote.\"\n\nGov. Dannel P. Malloy, Joe Biden Courtesy of Governor Malloy's Office Gov. Dannel P.
