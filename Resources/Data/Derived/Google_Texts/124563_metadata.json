This is having enormous economic impacts on small businesses across the country, including those located near the 401 national parks and 561 national wildlife refuge that are currently closed to campers, hikers, hunters, and anglers.\n\nMeanwhile, Republican politicians have been criticizing the Obama administration for shutting down national parks, refuges, and other public lands. For example, Sen. Jon Barrasso (R-WY) said in a hearing yesterday that:\n\nThe Obama administration has made a concerted effort to intentionally hurt the public. Maybe the [National] Park Service could study how to drop a large curtain in front of the mountains to block the view from the road.\n\nAnd Republicans on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee are \u201cin the early stages of examining\u201d a probe into the closure of monuments on the National Mall.\n\nNotwithstanding the challenges of protecting public safety and national park assets on minimal staff and without funding, right-wing media outlets have also attacked the National Park Service for being unable to re-open favorite parks and have gone so far as to vilify uniformed park rangers for \u201cclosing down parks, roads, and even scenic bypasses on a whim.\u201d These same outlets have promoted efforts to get citizens to \u201cbreak the barrier\u201d by illegally entering closed national parks and other federal lands.\n\nEncouraging unlawful access to national parks has serious safety implications, considering the National Park Service\u2019s contingency plan says that \u2014 without adequate staffing and resources \u2014 it can only be focused on the activities that are \u201cessential to respond to emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property.\u201d\n\nNew data from the Center for Western Priorities released Tuesday also shows how spread thin the National Park Service and other federal agencies now are. According to the group\u2019s analysis, before the shutdown there was one National Park Service employee for every 3,400 acres of national parks. But after the House Republican shutdown, there is now one national park ranger or employee on duty for every 26,000 acres of national parks. That\u2019s an area larger than the city of Miami.\n\nConservative politicians have apparently sensed Americans\u2019 frustration with the situation in Congress, and several are now pressing for special access to their favorite national parks, despite the fact that the National Park Service is out of money. South Dakota Gov. Dennis Daugaard (R), for example, has offered to keep the Mount Rushmore National Memorial open with state workers.\n\nArizona Gov. Jan Brewer (R) also wants the Grand Canyon to re-open using state funding.\n\nAnd Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R) has \u201cdefied\u201d orders to shut down state parks that receive federal funding.\n\nIt costs more than $2 billion a year to run the national park system \u2014 a small fraction of the federal budget \u2014 but the system welcomes more than 300 million visitors a year and is highly interdependent. Parks now rely heavily on national and regional-level resources within the National Park Service to assist with everything from human resources and communications to law enforcement and emergency response. Picking a single park to re-open is like expecting a major national bank that runs out of money to re-open a single branch. Not to mention the fact that more than 500 national wildlife refuges, thousands of campgrounds, and other federal facilities would still remain closed to public access if national parks were somehow opened on a piecemeal basis.\n\nOf course, as the Center for American Progress and the New York Times pointed out last week, many Republicans who now claim to be outraged by the closure of national parks have had no qualms voting against their funding, forcing closures under sequestration, and working to sell off America\u2019s public lands.
