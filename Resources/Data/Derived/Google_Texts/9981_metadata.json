But it is unusual to invite them into your actual appointment. Yet this is a growing trend in health care.\n\nShared medical appointments are becoming more popular as the Affordable Care Act covers more people. The idea of seeing your doctor alongside other patients is supposed to clear up wait times and get you better access to your physician.\n\nWatch report\n\nDr. Terrence Doorly, of North Shore Medical Center in Danvers, held a back pain shared medical appointment.\n\n\n\nThe way it works is people with a similar health issue are brought together. Doorly examines each patient individually and gives a prognosis along with a health plan. Other patients listen, compare and often learn from observing fellow patients.\n\n\n\nDoorly said patients find solace in one another, and he can spend more time dealing with their medical needs. The appointments run longer than an average doctor visit, and Doorly said that gives patients more for their money. Doctors continue to collect the same co-pay per patient as they would during a one on one appointment.\n\n\n\nEach patient signs a consent form to release their medical information to the others. It's completely voluntary, but in the four years it's been offered at North Shore Medical Center, more doctors are signing on to offer them.\n\n\n\nAbout 10 percent of the hospital's 78,000 patients are trying shared medical appointments.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health", "ib-analytics": "data", "item-publish-date": "Wed, 05 Mar 2014 18:20:44 EST", "generator": "ibPublish 2", "author": "Kimberly Bookman", "og": {"site_name": "WCVB", "description": "It's not odd to go to your doctor's office and sit in the waiting room with strangers.
