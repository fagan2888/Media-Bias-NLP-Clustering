Chaka Fattah (D., Pa) have been linked to the repayment of an illegal $1 million loan to Fattah\u2019s unsuccessful campaign for Philadelphia mayor in 2007.\n\nFattah\u2019s former aide, Gregory Naylor, has pleaded guilty in federal court to concealing the loan. Details from his plea deal claim that Fattah\u2019s nonprofits were used to repay the loan.\n\nThe congressman has not been charged in the case, and said last week he was never involved in any illegal activities during his time in office.\n\nFattah has extensively supported the two nonprofits and used taxpayer money to fund them. Their spending has been subject to scrutiny in the past. According to the Philadelphia Inquirer:\n\nThe unfolding Naylor case is the one that has come closest to Fattah, though, and the first that suggests one of his favored charities was involved in criminal activity. It touches on two entities he has promoted for years: the Educational Advancement Alliance and CORE (College Opportunity Resources for Education). They are the \u201cnonprofits 1 and 2\u201d cited in the plea deal, The Inquirer has learned. Naylor, in his plea deal, admitted his role in funneling federal dollars and charitable donations through the two groups, as well as private companies, in order to pay off a $1 million campaign loan Fattah received while running for mayor in 2007. The loan exceeded the city\u2019s $5,000 donation limit, prosecutors say. Fattah is identified in the plea documents only as \u201cElected Official A,\u201d though the details describing the official make it clear that it is the congressman.\n\nBoth charities had received millions in earmarks thanks to Fattah:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Two nonprofits founded by Rep.
