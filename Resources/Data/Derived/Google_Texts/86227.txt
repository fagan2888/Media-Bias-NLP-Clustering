Hundreds showed up Saturday morning to clean up the area around the Arkansas River near downtown Wichita.

Just under 800 volunteers showed up, ready to clean up the river.

"It makes me feel great, I got out on a nice spring day...and watched the community come together and make things nicer," said one volunteer.

People of all ages showed up to do their part.

Afterwards, there was a cookout for volunteers.
