The Atlanta Fed does not use the data on private employment.\n\nAll forecasting on GDP involves some guessing on trade and inventories, which are notoriously volatile, said Ethan Harris, head of global economics at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\n\nHarris, who previously was an economist at the New York Fed, said his current first-quarter GDP estimate, which shows nil growth, is more aligned with the Atlanta Fed's current figure than the New York Fed's stronger reading. \"I believe in my own model,\" he said.\n\nIt will take time for the New York Fed model to prove its forecast precision, Harris and O'Sullivan said.\n\n\"All these models are not perfect. I'm withholding judgment for now,\" said O'Sullivan.\n\n(Reporting by Richard Leong; Editing by Matthew Lewis and Dan Grebler)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - The New York Federal Reserve will launch a weekly gauge of the U.", "title": "N.Y.
