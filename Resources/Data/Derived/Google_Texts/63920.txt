Very rarely do we get to witness Ed Schultz raise his voice at anyone but the camera. On Thursday afternoon, MSNBC audience was treated to a spirited debate between Big Ed and TheBlaze TV host Dana Loesch.

The ideological polar opposites teased the possibility of an on-air battle Wednesday evening, when Loesch bashed the MSNBC host for criticizing her boss Glenn Beck for his take on health care policy. They eventually spoke by phone and agreed to air their grievances on cable news.

The results: Lots of finger-pointing, heated crosstalk, the host accusing the guest of being “rude,” etc., etc. See it to believe it.

After the segment ended, Schultz revealed today’s viewer poll: “Should The Ed Show bring on more conservative guests?”
