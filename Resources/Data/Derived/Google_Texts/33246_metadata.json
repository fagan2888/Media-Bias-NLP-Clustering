In 2015, its businesses had aggregate revenue and earnings totaling approximately $70 million and $9 million, respectively. Any remaining hospice operations in Arizona and Nevada will be closed.\n\n[Also: Dueling star ratings may confuse some home health patients]\n\n\"Home health and hospice services are non-strategic businesses for Genesis to operate at this time, and we believe we can better allocate the capital by de-levering our balance sheet,\" said Genesis CEO George Hager Jr. in a statement.\n\nGenesis said it may monetize other non-strategic assets; including the home health and hospice businesses, they're expected to generate $100 to $150 million of after-tax cash proceeds. Genesis intends to use the sale proceeds to repay indebtedness.\n\nCompassus CEO James Deal said in a statement that the deal bolsters the company's ability to deliver more post-acute care \"to even more patients, families and the healthcare professionals who serve them.\"\n\nTwitter: @JELagasse", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/genesis-healthcare-will-sell-home-health-hospice-operations-84-million", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/social%20health.jpg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Post-acute care provider Genesis HealthCare announced Wednesday it has signed an agreement to sell the majority of its home health and hospice operations to Compassus, a nationwide network of community-based hospice and palliative care programs, for $84 million.", "title": "Genesis HealthCare will sell home health, hospice operations for $84 million"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HC_Finance", "image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/social%20health.jpg"}, "description": "Post-acute care provider Genesis HealthCare announced Wednesday it has signed an agreement to sell the majority of its home health and hospice operations to Compassus, a nationwide network of community-based hospice and palliative care programs, for $84 million.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Genesis HealthCare will sell home health, hospice operations for $84 million"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Post-acute care provider Genesis HealthCare announced Wednesday it has signed an agreement to sell the majority of its home health and hospice operations to Compassus, a nationwide network of community-based hospice and palliative care programs, for $84 million.&#13; The transaction is expected to close within the next 90 days, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda598\"", "article_summary": "Post-acute care provider Genesis HealthCare announced Wednesday it has signed an agreement to sell the majority of its home health and hospice operations to Compassus, a nationwide network of community-based hospice and palliative care programs, for $84 million.\nGenesis' home health and hospice operations -- which were acquired during its February 2015 combination with Skilled Healthcare -- are located in California, Idaho, Montana and New Mexico.\nAny remaining hospice operations in Arizona and Nevada will be closed.\nGenesis said it may monetize other non-strategic assets; including the home health and hospice businesses, they're expected to generate $100 to $150 million of after-tax cash proceeds.\nIn 2015, its businesses had aggregate revenue and earnings totaling approximately $70 million and $9 million, respectively."}
