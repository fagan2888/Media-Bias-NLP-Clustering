Jerry Goodman, better known under his nom de plume Adam Smith, has died of complications related to cancer. His son Mark contacted me with the news. He was a good friend, and I will sorely miss him.

I’ll write more when I have time to review his career, and I assume that there will also be an obit in the Times, where he once served on the editorial board. I first met Jerry in 1976, when the grad students at MIT and Harvard threw a celebration of the bicentennial of The Wealth of Nations. Jerry came, dressed up in a frock coat and wig, and delivered a series of economics one-liners; I was one of the joke-writers. He wrote up the experience for New York magazine, and I’ll see if I can find it.

It shocks me, however, that I never knew that he coined the joke “Assume a can opener.”

Jerry had an amazing career and life. He wrote books about business and economics that were both informative and fun; he had a terrific TV show, “Adam Smith’s Money World”; and he branched out in many ways. I loved his book Powers of Mind, about his journey through mysticism and alternative lifestyles — not what you expect from someone who also writes about money!

I reconnected with Jerry when Robin and I moved to Princeton; it turned out that he and his wife Sallylived nearby, and we became very good friends.

There’s so much to say, and I’m tearing up. So consider this just a sad announcement, a placeholder for more to come.
