Imagine for a moment you are standing in the middle of Sports Authority Field at Mile High Stadium. A 360-degree panorama reveals every seat occupied by a young girl or boy, ages 1 to 6. Now, try to imagine that last year, each of these 76,125 children was a reported victim of abuse.

If this image is not abhorrent enough, imagine 32 additional stadiums of this size filled to capacity with abused children, representing the number of reported incidents of child mistreatment nationally in 2012.

The clinical concept of “child abuse” is broad. It covers emotional, physical and sexual abuse, as well as neglect. Child protective service agencies across the country recorded more than 2.5 million reports of child maltreatment in 2012, yet experts estimate that only about half, 1.6 million of these cases, received a follow-up investigation or assessment.

The lack of awareness and support surrounding this issue is concerning given the frequency of incidents and the resulting dire consequences. Earlier this month, The Denver Post reported on a local couple that is now facing felony child abuse charges against its four youngest children. The couple had previously lost custody of its three oldest children. The social worker responsible for removing the three children from the home in 2006 had warned officials that the couple was not fit to parent the subsequent children, but to no avail.

Child abuse is not a concern unique to Colorado or any other segment of the population. This “hidden epidemic” of abuse crosses all socio-economic, religious and ethnic boundaries. It is an equal opportunity destroyer of children, affecting them and their communities across the country.

These victims face an overwhelming number of challenges that not only negatively impact their chances at a bright future, but also harm surrounding communities. According to the Kempe Center for the Prevention and Treatment of Child Abuse:

• Abused adolescents are three times more likely to abuse drugs.

• Abused adolescents commit three times more juvenile crime.

• Abused girls are 50 percent more likely to become pregnant as teenagers.

• Abused school-age children consistently perform lower on standardized tests.

• Abused children are 2.5 times more likely to repeat at least one grade and two times more likely to require special educational services.

• Abused teenagers and adults are four times more likely to experience serious mental health problems such as anxiety disorders or depression.

• Abused teenagers are six times more likely to attempt suicide multiple times.

Looking at these figures, it is not difficult to see how and why child abuse and neglect is responsible for an extraordinary expense to taxpayers, estimated to cost our country billions of dollars annually. So, what is being done in the field of research, prevention and treatment of child abuse and neglect? Not nearly enough.

“There is a paucity of child abuse research and little federal support,” said Desmond K. Runyan, executive director of the Kempe Center. “Only about $4 million in new research projects per year are funded by the National Institutes of Health out of its annual budget of approximately $31 billion. This breaks down to $180.87 per new incident case. Compare this to $3,000 per incident case for cystic fibrosis and fibromyalgia, which account for approximately 1.5 percent of the U.S. population.”

It is time we talk openly about an uncomfortable national emergency affecting some 6 percent of the population. We must address this epidemic through research and education; state-of-the-art treatment for victims; advocacy for children; public awareness; and enforcement of laws to incarcerate convicted abusers with the goal to rehabilitate those afflicted. Together, we can stop abuse by making it part of our collective conscience and will to do so.
