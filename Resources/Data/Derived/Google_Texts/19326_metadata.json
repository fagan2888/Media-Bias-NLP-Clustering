Animal oracles around the world have taken on the mantle of predicting the winners of FIFA World Cup matches in Brazil.\n\nFrom a clairvoyant kangaroo in Australia to a soothsaying sea turtle in Brazil, there is no shortage of animal tipsters sharing their predictions for the month-long tournament.\n\nPaul\u2019s successors have had somewhat mixed results so far and punters would be wise not to take their divinations too seriously. Here are some of the animals and their mysterious ways for picking a winner.\n\nNelly the Elephant\n\nThe elephant, who reportedly made a name for herself as a soccer psychic during the 2006 Women\u2019s World Cup, the 2010 World Cup and Euro 2012, makes her selection by kicking a ball into a goal at her home in Serengeti Park in Hanover, Germany. Nelly correctly predicted the US would defeat Ghana in their opening match. She expects Ghana to triumph over Germany on Saturday. Her keepers, of course, hope she is wrong.\n\nFlopsy the Kangaroo\n\nThis adorable marsupial at Australia Zoo picks the winner by selecting food from one of two bowls marked with national flags. Australia Zoo shares the eastern grey kangaroo\u2019s predictions for the major matches on her Twitter account @predictaroo. Flopsy correctly picked Chile to defeat Australia, but was overly optimistic in her prediction for an Australian win over the Netherlands.\n\nShaheen the Camel\n\nThe camel sits in the Dubai desert between the flags of two competing teams and selects the winner by biting or nudging one of the flags. Shaheen got off to a good start, but has made some bad calls in recent days. Perhaps the sun is affecting the animal\u2019s judgment.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Paul the Octopus isn't the creature in the animal kingdom with clairvoyant powers VIDEO", "author": "Allison Jackson", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Paul the Octopus isn't the creature in the animal kingdom with clairvoyant powers VIDEO", "title": "5 psychic animals that can predict World Cup winners", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/22/meet_the_psychic_animals_that_can_predict_world_cup_winners_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2010/07/the_week_in_pictures_24-slide-13.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Paul the Octopus isn't the creature in the animal kingdom with clairvoyant powers VIDEO", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2010/07/the_week_in_pictures_24-slide-13.jpg", "title": "5 psychic animals that can predict World Cup winners", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "5 psychic animals that can predict World Cup winners", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, GlobalPost, psychic animals, Video, World Cup", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca7a8\"", "article_summary": "Topics: GlobalPost, psychic animals, Video, World Cup, Entertainment NewsThis article originally appeared on GlobalPostPaul the Octopus, whose extraordinary psychic abilities made him an international star in the 2010 World Cup, can rest in peace.\nAnimal oracles around the world have taken on the mantle of predicting the winners of FIFA World Cup matches in Brazil.\nNelly the ElephantThe elephant, who reportedly made a name for herself as a soccer psychic during the 2006 Women\u2019s World Cup, the 2010 World Cup and Euro 2012, makes her selection by kicking a ball into a goal at her home in Serengeti Park in Hanover, Germany.\nAustralia Zoo shares the eastern grey kangaroo\u2019s predictions for the major matches on her Twitter account @predictaroo.\nFlopsy the KangarooThis adorable marsupial at Australia Zoo picks the winner by selecting food from one of two bowls marked with national flags."}
