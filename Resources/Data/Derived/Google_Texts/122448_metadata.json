(Photo: Jeni Hargrove Connor)\n\nGILBERT, Ariz. - Chances are, you've probably heard that chocolate is poisonous to dogs, but did you know that Xylitol, a common sweetener, can be even more dangerous?\n\nJeni Hargrove Connor's family found out the hard way this February when their 1-year-old lab wound up in the animal hospital fighting for her life.\n\nShe made a video to let people know how toxic Xylitol can be to dogs. The video that has since gone viral.\n\nJeni Hargrove Connor posted a video after her familie's dog ended up in the hospital after eating gum contianing Xylitol. (Photo: Jeni Hargrove Connor)\n\nHargrove Connor said it all started with Dancer, snuck into her gym bag and ate an entire tub of Ice Breakers gum.\n\nDancer ate more than 20 peices of gum. About an hour later she got very sick. (Photo: Jeni Hargrove Connor)\n\nAt first Hargrove Connor didn't think much of it, until about an hour later, when her husband noticed Dancer looked drunk. They called their vet who told them to immediately rush Dancer to the animal hospital.\n\nThe vet told Hargrove Connor to immediately rush Dancer to the animal hospital. (Photo: Jeni Hargrove Connor)\n\nAs Dancer was laying on Jeni Hargrove Connor's daughters' laps, she had a horrible seizure that lasted about 90 seconds. They thought the worst...\n\nOn the way to the hospital Dancer had a bad seizure. (Photo: Jeni Hargrove Connor)\n\nDancer made it through the seizure and animal hospital staff saved her. She had to spend two nights in the hospital, and her liver is still being monitored.\n\nXylitol can be very toxic for dogs, and it can be found in many sugar-free things including gum and toothpaste. (Photo: Jeni Hargrove Connor)\n\nMoral of the story: Xylitol can be toxic to dogs. It is a sugar-free sweetener that can be common in gum, mints, toothpaste, vitamins, low-sugar peanut butter and other sugar-free food.\n\nHargrove Connor said, \u201cWe felt like we didn\u2019t keep our dog safe. It\u2019s just like a child. When you have a toddler, you keep your cabinets locked, you medicines up, you keep bleaches and poisons away from your kids and really the same thing needs to be done if you\u2019re going to take on the responsibility of having a dog.\u201d\n\nYou can watch the full video above, and see her post here:\n\nPlease view this video on Dancer's story and please share.
