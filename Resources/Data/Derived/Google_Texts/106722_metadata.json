The ascent of popular startups like Uber and Airbnb \u2014 which have about them a decidedly libertarian flavor \u2014 has only strengthened this supposedly conventional wisdom.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing, though. The data show that this is an unlikely possibility, but more problematically, doing so would actually decimate the Republican base. The truth is, libertarianism is antithetical to conservatism.\n\nThe Republican base, broadly speaking, is made up of five often-overlapping coalitions: business conservatives who seek low taxes and low regulation; foreign policy hawks who seek a strong defense budget; social conservatives who fear moral anarchy; racists and nativists worried about immigration and affirmative action; and elderly retirees who rely on Social Security and Medicare. This coalition is already difficult enough to maintain, but in the future it will become more difficult.\n\nAnd a \u201clibertarian\u201d message would only further erode the base.\n\nBusiness conservatives seem like they would be the most open to a libertarian message. After all, lower taxes and less regulation are amenable to both groups. But Republicans are already very pro-business and anti-regulation; to go further in order to pull in a few more libertarians would entail (1) decreased fiscal or monetary intervention, or (2) the elimination of corporate subsidies. Both of these moves would alienate business conservatives, who, after all, rely significantly on government support (to the tune of $92 billion in 2006) and accept the need for countercyclical spending policies. Libertarians might struggle to support Republicans doling out farm subsidies year after year, subsidizing exports and bailing out big businesses and banks, but business conservatives demand it.\n\nForeign policy hawks would also find many of the core tenets of libertarianism \u2014 skepticism of foreign interventionism, opposition to the NSA and a healthy loathing of the military-industrial complex \u2014 to be problematic. Republicans could try to peel off support among libertarians by opposing torture, closing Guantanamo and investigating the NSA, but it\u2019s tough to believe that the party of Bush, Cheney, Wolfowitz and Rumsfeld would be able to garner much trust. The swift turn of Rand Paul from libertarian anti-interventionist to foreign policy hawk attests to the difficulty in going this route.\n\nSocial conservatives would likely be the most difficult challenge to libertarians. Libertarians tend to support individual liberty:the right to gamble, drink, smoke, watch pornography, take one\u2019s own life, participate in any form of sexual activity and use drugs. Needless to say, these views would be incredibly problematic for the moral majority coalition, which still forms an incredibly important part of the Republican base. It was Hayek who wrote in \u201cWhy I\u2019m Not A Conservative\u201d: \u201cThe conservative does not object to coercion or arbitrary power so long as it is used for what he regards as the right purposes\u2026 like the socialist he regards himself as entitled to force the values he holds onto other people.\u201d\n\nWhile it\u2019s often considered impolite to note in public, a rather significant base of Republican power is still nativism. Witness the hysterical response to Central American refugees, the baseless claims against Obama\u2019s citizenship, and the opposition to any immigration reform that doesn\u2019t include a moat full of crocodiles across the border. But most libertarians are strongly supportive of open borders. Libertarian economist Bryan Caplan calls it, \u201cThe Efficient, Egalitarian, Libertarian, Utilitarian Way to Double World GDP.\u201d In a world when even the \u201creasonable\u201d Republicans are still spouting xenophobic drivel, witness Ross Douthat\u2019s column worrying that \u201cthe bills under discussion almost always offer some form of legal status before enforcement takes effect, which promises a replay of the Reagan-era amnesty\u2019s failure to ever deliver the limits on future immigration that it promised.\u201d\n\nFinally, there are the elderly retirees, whose support Republicans maintain by making sure that any spending cuts fall on the backs of the poor \u2014 not the old. One wonders how they would receive the Cato Institute plan to turn Social Security into private savings accounts subject to market forces. Many would balk if a politician called Social Security \u201cfederally mandated generational theft,\u201d but this is how Nick Gillespie regards it. Social Security and Medicare are sacrosanct and any attempt to reform them is likely a \u201cthird rail\u201d that would lead to electoral death for the politician that tried.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The conventional wisdom is that a libertarian shift would revitalize Republicans \u2014 but that's dead wrong", "title": "The GOP\u2019s libertarian time bomb: Why \u201cgoing Rand\u201d would be an electoral disaster", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The conventional wisdom is that a libertarian shift would revitalize Republicans \u2014 but that's dead wrong", "title": "The GOP\u2019s libertarian time bomb: Why \u201cgoing Rand\u201d would be an electoral disaster", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/08/23/the_gops_libertarian_time_bomb_why_going_rand_would_be_an_electoral_disaster/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/rand_paul18.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The conventional wisdom is that a libertarian shift would revitalize Republicans \u2014 but that's dead wrong", "title": "The GOP\u2019s libertarian time bomb: Why \u201cgoing Rand\u201d would be an electoral disaster", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/rand_paul18.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sean McElwee", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Conservatism, Editor's Picks, GOP, Libertarianism, Rand Paul, Republican Party", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The data show that this is an unlikely possibility, but more problematically, doing so would actually decimate the Republican base.\nOne wonders how they would receive the Cato Institute plan to turn Social Security into private savings accounts subject to market forces.\nSocial Security and Medicare are sacrosanct and any attempt to reform them is likely a \u201cthird rail\u201d that would lead to electoral death for the politician that tried.\nMany would balk if a politician called Social Security \u201cfederally mandated generational theft,\u201d but this is how Nick Gillespie regards it.\nNeedless to say, these views would be incredibly problematic for the moral majority coalition, which still forms an incredibly important part of the Republican base."}
