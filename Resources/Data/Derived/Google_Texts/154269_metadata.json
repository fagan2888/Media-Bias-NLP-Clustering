However, research has shown that potential contaminants in vaping smoke could have adverse effects on those who inhale them. Public health advocates have argued that e-cigarettes are a gateway drug of sorts to actual tobacco smoking.\n\nThe CDC report showed that about half of the calls to poison centers around the U.S. had to do with children under the age of 5, who had been playing with e-cigarettes and been exposed to the nicotine liquid. Since 2010, when there was only one call per month to poison centers involving e-cigarette liquid, rates have jumped up to 215 calls per month in February 2014.\n\n\u201cThis report raises another red flag about e-cigarettes \u2014 the liquid nicotine used in e-cigarettes can be hazardous,\u201d Dr. Tom Frieden, CDC director, said in a statement. Additionally, kids who aren\u2019t addicted to nicotine could find themselves becoming addicted through the use of sweet-flavored e-cigs that otherwise seem harmless.\n\nIn the meantime, while the e-cigarette debate rolls on, the FDA pledges to push the rule forward to help curb any hazardous events or long-term consequences of vaping. \u201cI do believe that very soon I will be able to call you, and say the deeming rule is out,\u201d Hamburg said in respose to Senator Merkley's prodding.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "fda, e-cigarettes, regulating e-cigarettes, e-cigarettes poisonous", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "After a report branded e-cigarettes as poisonous to children, the FDA announced it will push a new rule to manage e-cigarettes.", "title": "FDA \u2018Pushing Hard\u2019 For E-Cigarette Rule To Monitor Vaping", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/fda-pushing-hard-e-cigarette-rule-after-cdc-report-brands-vaping-poisonous-kids-274796", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/04/05/vaping.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "After a report branded e-cigarettes as poisonous to children, the FDA announced it will push a new rule to manage e-cigarettes.", "title": "FDA \u2018Pushing Hard\u2019 For E-Cigarette Rule To Monitor Vaping", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/fda-pushing-hard-e-cigarette-rule-after-cdc-report-brands-vaping-poisonous-kids-274796", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/04/05/vaping.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/04/05/vaping.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-04-05T18:27:16-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-04-05T18:27:15-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "After a report branded e-cigarettes as poisonous to children, the FDA announced it will push a new rule to manage e-cigarettes."}, "article_summary": "After a report branded e-cigarettes as poisonous to children, the FDA announced it will push a new rule to manage e-cigarettes.\n\u201cThis report raises another red flag about e-cigarettes \u2014 the liquid nicotine used in e-cigarettes can be hazardous,\u201d Dr. Tom Frieden, CDC director, said in a statement.\nIn the meantime, while the e-cigarette debate rolls on, the FDA pledges to push the rule forward to help curb any hazardous events or long-term consequences of vaping.\nHowever, research has shown that potential contaminants in vaping smoke could have adverse effects on those who inhale them.\nAdditionally, kids who aren\u2019t addicted to nicotine could find themselves becoming addicted through the use of sweet-flavored e-cigs that otherwise seem harmless."}
