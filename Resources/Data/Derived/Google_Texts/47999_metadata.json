They\u2019re called Ig Nobel Prizes, and this year\u2019s winners studied a wide array of fun topics from reindeers to the slippery-ness of banana peels.\n\nThe Ig Nobel Prizes are also known for pointing out there is sometimes truth in old wives\u2019 tales and folk remedies. For example, instead of stuffing your nose with tampons to stop a nosebleed, Ig Nobel prize winners studied the use of pork strips, which proved to be an effective remedy for a brutal, life-threatening hemorrhaging disorder called Glanzmann thrombasthenia. Patients who have the disorder suffer from improper blood clotting, and often experience heavy nosebleeds.\n\n\u201cWe had to do some out-of-the-box thinking,\u201d Dr. Sonal Saraiya and her team from Detroit Medical Center, who completed the study, said. \u201cSo that\u2019s where we put our heads together and thought to the olden days and what they used to do.\u201d\n\nIn the study, they packed a 4-year-old\u2019s nostrils with cured pork twice, and found that \u201cthe nasal vaults successfully stopped nasal hemorrhage promptly (and) effectively.\u201d The authors discovered that pork contains clotting factors as well as a lot of salt, which pulled a lot of fluid from the nose. They continued: \u201cTo our knowledge, this represents the first description of nasal packing with strips of cured pork for treatment of life-threatening hemorrhage in a patient with Glanzmann thrombasthenia.\u201d But the researchers don\u2019t think an ordinary nosebleed should be treated with pork strips; it could cause an infection, so the bizarre treatment should be reserved for people with Glanzmann thrombasthenia.\n\nOther studies that won prizes included research that examined people\u2019s reactions to seeing faces in pieces of toast, whether owning a cat had a negative effect on mental health, and whether banana skins were truly dangerous to step on, as cartoons often depict them to be. The rest of the studies can be found on the Ig Nobel website.\n\n\u201cThe Ig Nobel Prizes honor achievements that first make people laugh, and then makes them think,\u201d Improbable Research writes on its website. \u201cThe prizes are intended to celebrate the unusual, honor the imaginative \u2014 and spur people\u2019s interest in science, medicine, and technology.\u201d The awards ceremony takes place at Harvard University\u2019s Sanders Theatre, where prizes \u201care physically handed out [to the winners] by genuinely bemused genuine Nobel Laureates,\u201d the website continues.\n\nAs biochemistry professor and science fiction author Isaac Asimov said, \u201cThe most exciting phrase to hear in science, the one that heralds new discoveries, is not \u2018Eureka!\u2019 but, \u2018That\u2019s funny\u2026'\u201d\n\nSource: Humphreys I, Saraiya S, Belenky W, Dworkin J. \u201cNasal packing with strips of cured pork as treatment for uncontrollable epistaxis in a patient with Glanzmann thrombasthenia.\u201d Annals of Otology, 2014.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "ig noble prize, nosebleeds, improbable research, glanzmann thrombasthenia", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A strange experiment involving stuffing pork strips into the nose of a 4-year-old resulted in a team of scientists winning the Ig Nobel prize.", "title": "Packing Your Nose With Pork Strips Stops Nosebleeds: 'Improbable Research'", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/stop-nosebleeds-pork-strips-improbable-remedy-people-glanzmann-thrombasthenia-304042", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/19/nosebleed.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A strange experiment involving stuffing pork strips into the nose of a 4-year-old resulted in a team of scientists winning the Ig Nobel prize.", "title": "Packing Your Nose With Pork Strips Stops Nosebleeds: 'Improbable Research'", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/stop-nosebleeds-pork-strips-improbable-remedy-people-glanzmann-thrombasthenia-304042", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/19/nosebleed.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/19/nosebleed.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Conditions", "published_time": "2014-09-19T16:20:14-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-19T16:20:13-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A strange experiment involving stuffing pork strips into the nose of a 4-year-old resulted in a team of scientists winning the Ig Nobel prize."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbbbb\"", "article_summary": "\u201cNasal packing with strips of cured pork as treatment for uncontrollable epistaxis in a patient with Glanzmann thrombasthenia.\u201d Annals of Otology, 2014.\n\u201cThe Ig Nobel Prizes honor achievements that first make people laugh, and then makes them think,\u201d Improbable Research writes on its website.\nThe Ig Nobel Prizes are also known for pointing out there is sometimes truth in old wives\u2019 tales and folk remedies.\nBelieve it or not, there are legitimate Nobel prizes out there for scientists who make bizarre and seemingly silly \u2014 but important \u2014 discoveries.\nFor example, instead of stuffing your nose with tampons to stop a nosebleed, Ig Nobel prize winners studied the use of pork strips, which proved to be an effective remedy for a brutal, life-threatening hemorrhaging disorder called Glanzmann thrombasthenia."}
