What do the American people actually want to know?\n\nLet\u2019s begin with something concrete. In \u201cfounder-speak\u201d (referring colloquially to our national beginnings), \u201cthe American people\u201d was a loose term to describe the formation of public opinion. This was a moment in history when \u201csovereign people,\u201d a largely theoretical construct, contested the crowned sovereigns who then ruled most of the planet. It was not yet the tool of the average demagogue (say, Ted Cruz) or the average attack ad (\u201cThe American people have had enough of\u2026.\u201d). Let\u2019s see if we can travel from then to now, and make better sense of the history of a phrase.\n\nIn July 1775, not long after the battles of Lexington, Concord and Bunker Hill, the Second Continental Congress petitioned King George III. In the interest of reconciling the United Colonies with the parent state, even after the occasion of much bloodshed, the earnest petitioners bade him (who was yet their king) to make \u201csuch arrangements as your Majesty\u2019s wisdom can form for collecting the united sense of your American people.\u201d If he ceased thinking of them as rebels, he would soon understand that their very reasonable desire was a return to the mild government they had previously enjoyed under their sovereign. The patient members of Congress who signed the petition presumed that a sympathetic connection could yet be found if a reliably objective representative of the crown somehow took the pulse of these distant subjects en masse.\n\nIn Federalist 37, James Madison wrote: \u201cStability in government is essential to national character and to the advantages annexed to it, as well as to that repose and confidence in the minds of the people, which are among the chief blessings of civil society.\u201d As the Constitution was being framed, \u201cnational character\u201d doubled for \u201cthe American people,\u201d and was typically linked to the informed (moral as well as intellectual) choices they made in identifying the public interest with those individuals they considered worthy of office. National character was meant as an expression of the unity of interest and rights in America; it bespoke a desire to be collectively honest, introspective and visible to the outside world as a character-driven republic.\n\nEven as we acknowledge all partisan dysfunction, this ideal about who we are has never left our vocabulary. The airwaves draw us to all manner of \u201cBreaking News\u201d: verbal gaffes, inaccurate comparisons to Hitler, hints of scandal. Campaign chatter threatens to burst the collective eardrum. Amid this unfiltered noise, the ultimate authority, \u201cthe American people,\u201d lies in reserve, and we expect to hear it invoked as reassurance that a comprehensive viewpoint exists, and that we matter.\n\nReaders might be surprised to learn that in the early years of the republic, \u201cthe American people\u201d was not used nearly so much as it is now, nor as all-embracingly. Each Fourth of July, newspapers dutifully took note of the general spirit of camaraderie that \u201cdistinguishes the American people as one family.\u201d Beyond national celebration, politicians did not rely on this terminology.\n\nThat is not to say campaign season was ever truly a time of rational discourse, or that presidential wannabes were uniformly acknowledged as the best men for the job. In some ways, the 1848 election was like 2016 in the questions being asked about candidate qualifications and concerns aired with respect to voters\u2019 suggestive minds. In that election year, a newspaper in east Texas \u2014 which state had only joined the Union three years earlier \u2014 took issue with Whig candidate Zachary Taylor, a victorious general who rode to fame in Mexico but had an ambiguous political identity. \u201cThe American people are notorious for their good common sense, and practicality,\u201d went the editorial, \u201cyet they are as easily humbugged as any people on the face of the earth.\u201d To see General Taylor elected \u201cwould prove that the people were liable to be humbugged\u201d \u2014 in other words, made the victims of a hoax, their political innocence imposed upon. Did the presidential hopeful even understand \u201cthe fundamental principles, and complicated machinery by which this great Union is held together?\u201d\n\nThe editorialist delivered a stern warning. No one actually knew whether Taylor\u2019s success in the late war was due to \u201cgood Generalship, the insignificance of his enemy, the chivalry of his own troops, the act of Providence, or a combination of these.\u201d The desire to believe the best about a supposed savior had overtaken reasoned evidence. A political unknown\u2019s \u201cinfluence over the American people\u201d was, the columnist insisted, \u201cdangerous to their liberties, and degrading to their character as intelligent people.\u201d\n\nThe year 1848 is not remote, in terms of the perils inherent in democracy. The Texas critic was an early incarnation of today\u2019s questioners who wonder whether a real estate mogul or a neurosurgeon with no experience representing the public interest deserve to be seriously considered for high office. The American people continue to be \u201chumbugged,\u201d only now it comes courtesy of an instantaneous, visually aggressive format. As many have observed, we are glued to our screens, and the message is never neutral.\n\nPart of the reason why \u201cthe American people\u201d sounds so good dates to the latter part of the nineteenth century, when the phrase was often invoked to describe a superior race. \u201cWe are emphatically a people of nerves,\u201d declared the American Magazine in 1888. \u201cVisitors from other lands are astonished at the fierce activity that pervades our most insignificant actions.\u201d The energy embodied in the American character was due in some measure to the \u201cAmerican climate, which teaches in a vigorous and obtrusive manner that quiet and rest do not form part of natural law in this country.\u201d We remained young and wakeful. \u201cScarcely out of swaddling clothes,\u201d ran this generally upbeat article, \u201cwe are called upon to stand squarely in competition with a thousand years of past, and show the old fogies a new thing or two.\u201d\n\nThe country was in the midst of an immigrant deluge \u2014 the Statue of Liberty had just been dedicated. The writer predicted a future of \u201cdiluted\u201d Americanness, the national essence weakened through the infusion of questionable foreign blood. Here we see shades of the nativist critique launched by Donald Trump, warning energetic Americans that they have to do something about Mexico\u2019s \u201cworst people\u201d and warning voters to steer clear of \u201clow energy\u201d presidential candidates.\n\nThe American people were under attack. We hear the same catch-all out of politicians\u2019 mouths day after day after day. Take Ted Cruz in Congress at the end of September: \u201cThere is a reason the American people are fed up with Washington. There is a reason the American people are frustrated. The frustration is not simply mild or passing or ephemeral. It is volcanic. Over and over again, the American people go to the ballot box, over and over again, the American people rise up and say the direction we\u2019re going doesn\u2019t make sense. We want change \u2026 and yet, nothing changes in Washington.\u201d Almost every sentence is dominated by the same subject: the American people.", "article_metadata": {"description": "GOP candidates like Ted Cruz love this phrase.
