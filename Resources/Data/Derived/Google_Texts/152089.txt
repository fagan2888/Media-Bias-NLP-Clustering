LOS ANGELES (AP) — Studio estimates say “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” sliced off $65 million at the weekend box office.

The Paramount comic-book adaptation featuring Megan Fox alongside computer-generated renditions of the pizza-eating, sewer-dwelling superheroes lunged into first place in its debut weekend.

The studio announced plans Sunday for a sequel scheduled for June 3, 2016.

Marvel’s cosmic romp “Guardians of the Galaxy” starring Chris Pratt and Zoe Saldana as members of an intergalactic band of do-gooders slid into second place in its second weekend, with $41.5 million, bringing its total domestic haul to $175.9 million.

The Warner Bros. disaster film “Into the Storm” touched down in third place with $18 million.
