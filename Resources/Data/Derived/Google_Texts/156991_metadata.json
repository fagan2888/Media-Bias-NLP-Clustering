The majority of those diagnosed are over 65 and Medicare beneficiaries, CMS said.\n\nCMS said it has determined that a new way of paying for and delivering cancer care is needed. Called the Oncology Care Model, it would invest in physician-led practices.\n\nThe initiative aims to link payment to quality of care, find new ways to improve and coordinate care delivery, and to share cancer care information more broadly among providers, consumers, and others to support better decisions, CMS said.\n\nIt said the model would reward practices that focus on providing services that specifically improve the patient experience and health outcomes, the agency said.\n\nCMS hopes to broaden the initiative to include a larger portion of the population through participation of Medicaid programs and non-government payers.\n\nPhysician group practices and solo practitioners that provide chemotherapy for cancer and are enrolled in Medicare may apply to participate, CMS said.\n\n\"Other payers, including commercial insurers, Medicare Advantage plans, state programs, and Medicaid managed care plans, are also encouraged to apply,\" it said.\n\n(Reporting by Bill Berkrot;
