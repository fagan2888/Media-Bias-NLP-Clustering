The coordinators plan to meet four times a year to share ideas.\n\n\"Over time, I hope we can build a bank of tips and strategies we can use all over the district,\" he said. \"I'm just so excited about this.\"\n\nIn nearby Adams 12 school district, a new health and wellness team was created just last year, with the goal of getting kids to be active physically and mentally.\n\nAdams 12 received a $200,000 grant from Kaiser Permanente to put physical education programs in Broomfield schools, such as Coyote Ridge and Centennial elementary schools.\n\n\"We want students to be moving for more minutes, and moving more vigorously to bring up their heart rate,\" said Karina Delaney, a coordinated school health manager with the district.\n\nIn September, Adams 12 also received $170,000 in grant funding from RMC Health, an organization that helps coach and train teachers and staff so they can help improve the mental, physical, social, and emotional health of children in the district, she said.\n\nThat grant, which is being applied at Meridian Elementary and Legacy High schools in Broomfield, helps teachers come up with physical and mental activities to help students be more productive, as well as physically and mentally stimulated.\n\nFor example, classrooms can use \"brain break\" software that leads students in physical and mental exercises as a break from sitting at their desk throughout class, she said.\n\n\"We just started these programs, so we're interested to see the outcomes in the coming years,\" she said.\n\nIn nearby St. Vrain Valley School District, a $1.4 million physical activity grant from the Colorado Health Foundation is covering professional development and supplies for classroom movement; recess equipment. such as balls, hula hoops and flying discs; and supervisor stipends, entry fees for low-income students and incentives for school running clubs.\n\nThis fall, half of the district's elementary and K-8 schools added classroom movement programs and 100 Mile running clubs, while the other half will add programs next school year. The clubs encourage students to walk or run 100 miles during the school year.\n\nThe district's classroom movement initiative started at Red Hawk Elementary School in Erie, which has scheduled student movement sessions each morning since the school opened in August 2011.\n\nRed Hawk Principal Cyrus Weinberger said the benefits of integrating movement in the school day \u2014 higher academic performance, better retention of information and focus, and fewer behavior issues \u2014 is backed by about 20 years of research.\n\n\"You get a lot more out of your students when you introduce physical activity breaks throughout the day rather than just expecting them to sit still,\" he said. \"Classroom movement programs are really starting to catch on, not just in St. Vrain, but all over the country.\"\n\nIn Boulder Valley, Holloway said, many elementary school already include some movement, from walking clubs to movement Fridays. The goal of the grant is to encourage more and give teachers new tools, he said.\n\nAlong with training, the grant covers classroom equipment such as scarves and bean bags and online access to materials.\n\nSpark trainer Joan Gilliam recommends teachers target getting kids moving for at least 30 minutes during the school day using a five-minute movement break, a 10-minute academic physical activity, such as telling a story using movement, and a 15-minute active recess.\n\nTeachers at Lafayette's Ryan Elementary said they signed up for the movement training to expand on what they're already doing, including dance breaks and giving students Popsicle sticks with different exercises written on them, like jumping jacks or lunges.\n\n\"Movement helps the kids be better learners,\" said Ryan first-grade teacher Melia Syed. \"They're more focused after a movement break.\"\n\nEnterprise staff writer Megan Quinn contributed to this report.\n\nAmy Bounds: 303-473-1341, boundsa@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/boundsa", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-county-schools/ci_26840338/boulder-valley-training-teachers-classroom-movement", "sailthru.author": "By Amy Bounds \n \n  Camera Staff Writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:26840338:view"}, "startDate": "2014-11-01T11:30:00-0600", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "Boulder Valley teachers enthusiastically pretended to jump rope, juggled scarves, hopped and skipped, and played an active version of rock, paper scissors \u2014 all with a goal of learning quick ways to get their students moving.", "title": "Boulder Valley training teachers in classroom movement", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-county-schools/ci_26840338/boulder-valley-training-teachers-classroom-movement", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2014/1031/20141031__02DCAMOVw~1.jpg", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Boulder Education & Schools", "modificationDate": "2014-11-02T19:40:10-0700", "endDate": "2024-10-31T18:25:50-0600", "news_keywords": "news information  boulder county schools elementary middle high preps", "byline": "By Amy BoundsCamera", "pubDate": "2014-10-31T18:32:03-0600", "sailthru.date": "2014-11-01T11:30:00-0600", "sailthru.title": "Boulder Valley training teachers in classroom movement", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2014/1031/20141031__02DCAMOVw~1_300.jpg", "description": "Boulder Valley teachers enthusiastically pretended to jump rope, juggled scarves, hopped and skipped, and played an active version of rock, paper scissors \u2014 all with a goal of learning quick ways to get their students moving.", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-county-schools/ci_26840338/boulder-valley-training-teachers-classroom-movement", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "Boulder Valley teachers enthusiastically pretended to jump rope, juggled scarves, hopped and skipped, and played an active version of rock, paper scissors \u2014 all with a goal of learning quick ways to get their students moving.", "title": "Boulder Valley training teachers in classroom movement"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2014/1031/20141031__02DCAMOVw~1.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9ad8\"", "article_summary": "About 95 teachers from eight Boulder Valley schools this week attended training sessions on classroom movement.\nIn Boulder Valley, Holloway said, many elementary school already include some movement, from walking clubs to movement Fridays.\nEmerald Elementary teacher Stefanie Stoddard, at front, participates with other teachers in an exercise during a Boulder Valley School District training session on Tuesday, Oct. 28, in Boulder.\nThe district's classroom movement initiative started at Red Hawk Elementary School in Erie, which has scheduled student movement sessions each morning since the school opened in August 2011.\nBoulder Valley Fine Arts Director Roy Holloway, who wrote the Kaiser Permanente grant, said each of the eight participating schools appointed a school movement coordinator."}
