CLEVELAND (AP) — Hillary Clinton wants stricter rules on auto imports than the Obama administration negotiated in a sweeping Pacific trade deal that’s a major priority for the White House.

Under the Trans-Pacific Partnership, automobiles could be imported tax-free into the U.S. even if most parts in those vehicles were made in countries that are not in the trade alliance.

That’s drawn opposition from auto-state senators, such as Ohio Democrat Sherrod Brown, who say it would encourage manufacturers to use cheaper parts from China, which is not part of the agreement.

Despite her tougher line, Clinton did not specify what rules on domestic auto parts she would favor as she campaigned in advance of the Ohio presidential primaries Tuesday. Nor did she say how she would intend to achieve them, because the Pacific trade deal can only be accepted or rejected by Congress in full — not further negotiated.

Clinton campaigned with Brown in Youngstown, Ohio, on Saturday.

The Democratic presidential contender came out against the trade agreement in the fall, driving a wedge between Obama and herself. As his secretary of state, she had advocated for the agreement dozens of times, calling it the “gold standard” of trade deals as it took shape.

After a loss in Michigan last week, she is trying to boost support in Rust Belt states, where rival Bernie Sanders has shown strength. He’s made opposition to trade agreements, which he argues hurt American workers, central in his campaign.

Sanders frequently criticizes Clinton’s past support for trade deals such as the North American Free Trade Agreement and one normalizing trade relations with China. Both were signed by President Bill Clinton while she was first lady.
