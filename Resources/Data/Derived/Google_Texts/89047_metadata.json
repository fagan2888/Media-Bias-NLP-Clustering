Pretty good for Johnny Manziel, too.\n\nWhen Smith leads the Kansas City Chiefs into Sunday\u2019s game against the Browns, he may as well be showing his Cleveland counterpart what\u2019s still possible. The start to Manziel\u2019s career has been every bit as turbulent as Smith\u2019s beginning in San Francisco, yet the former No. 1 overall pick has matured to the point he\u2019s a Pro Bowl alternate for a Chiefs team barreling toward the playoffs.\n\n\u201cI obviously had a lot of expectations and a lot of hype coming in,\u201d Manziel said. \u201cHe obviously did being a first-round pick, too, but he did get some patience with the organization that he was with, and I think it\u2019s panned out for him because I think he\u2019s a good quarterback.\u201d\n\nThose first few years were quite the struggle, though. Smith had difficulty living up to expectations, and it took a new 49ers regime before Smith finally started to flourish.\n\nEven then, he was jettisoned in favor of Colin Kaepernick. Smith never lost faith in himself. And now in his third season in Kansas City, he is putting together arguably the finest season of his 10-year career, one that has the Chiefs (9-5) riding an eight-game winning streak.\n\nSmith went more than 300 passes without a pick earlier this season, setting a Chiefs record. He is on pace to shatter his career high for yards passing, and his 16 touchdown passes and four interceptions represent the best touchdown-to-interception ratio of his career.\n\nIn short, he\u2019s come a long way from completing 50 percent of his passes as a rookie.\n\n\u201cHe knows he\u2019s in charge out there,\u201d Chiefs coach Andy Reid said. \u201cHe\u2019s got a little flexibility to get you in and out of plays, good or bad situations, and put you in good situations.\u201d\n\nThat may be the mark of an established quarterback \u2014 the point Manziel is trying to reach.\n\nThe first-round pick of the Browns (3-11) last year, Manziel went 0-2 as a starter as a rookie. Things have been just as topsy-turvy in Year 2, which has included off-field issues, a benching after the bye, and a couple of decent performances that have earned him another start Sunday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you the same thing I told you when he was in college: He\u2019s an explosive player,\u201d Reid said. \u201cFrom a defensive standpoint, you\u2019ve got to make sure you play the whole play and then a little.\u201d\n\nThe finish to the season could be crucial for Manziel, because the Browns will have another high draft pick. That means they must decide soon whether to continue to build around him.\n\n\u201cThey see him ultra-prepared. They see him seamlessly calling plays in the huddle and getting guys lined up, and knowing where to go with the ball and doing his job. There is no substitute for hard work to get to that point,\u201d Browns coach Mike Pettine said. \u201cHe has put it in and has done it.\u201d\n\nSACK CITY: Manziel won\u2019t have a fresh Chiefs pass rush to worry about. Outstanding linebacker Justin Houston is sidelined by a hyperextended knee, and Pro Bowl counterpart Tamba Hali had surgery this week to repair a broken thumb. That means the Chiefs could be getting after the quarterback with second-year pro Dee Ford and Frank Zombo, a linebacker better suited to playing the middle.\n\nHOBBLED LINE: It would also help Manziel\u2019s cause if Pro Bowl offensive linemen Alex Mack and Joe Thomas are close to 100 percent. Mack had a calf injury and Thomas a problematic knee, and both of them missed time in practice this week.\n\nTIGHT END TESTS: The Chiefs\u2019 Travis Kelce will be going to his first Pro Bowl, while the Browns\u2019 Gary Barnidge is an alternate and could join him in Hawaii. \u201cHopefully I don\u2019t have to go. Our eyes are on the prize,\u201d Kelce said of the Super Bowl. \u201cWe\u2019re looking to going after the big dog. We\u2019re not looking at the individual stuff right now. We\u2019re trying to take this team here to the big show.\u201d\n\nBOWE SHOW BACK, MAYBE: Browns wide receiver Dwayne Bowe will return to Kansas City, where he spent the first eight years of his career, assuming he is active. He\u2019s only played in six games after signing a two-year, $13 million deal with Cleveland.\n\nHEADY STUFF: Marcus Peters had a memorable week. Not only did the Chiefs\u2019 rookie cornerback earn a Pro Bowl spot, he was voted AFC defensive player of the week after his second pick-six. \u201cGetting player of the week, that\u2019s big-time,\u201d Peters said, \u201cbut I\u2019ll take the win over that.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Chiefs\u2019 Alex Smith showing Browns\u2019 Johnny Manziel path to success", "title": "Chiefs\u2019 Alex Smith showing Browns\u2019 Johnny Manziel path to success", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/12/24/chiefs-alex-smith-showing-browns-johnny-manziel-path-to-success/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151224_095527_johnny-manziel-2.jpg", "height": 437}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151224_095527_johnny-manziel-2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-24T09:40:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T19:44:12+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "When Smith leads the Kansas City Chiefs into Sunday\u2019s game against the Browns, he may as well be showing his Cleveland counterpart what\u2019s still possible.\nHOBBLED LINE: It would also help Manziel\u2019s cause if Pro Bowl offensive linemen Alex Mack and Joe Thomas are close to 100 percent.\n\u201cHe has put it in and has done it.\u201dSACK CITY: Manziel won\u2019t have a fresh Chiefs pass rush to worry about.\n1 overall pick has matured to the point he\u2019s a Pro Bowl alternate for a Chiefs team barreling toward the playoffs.\nNot only did the Chiefs\u2019 rookie cornerback earn a Pro Bowl spot, he was voted AFC defensive player of the week after his second pick-six."}
