The children remind her of Axel, her 2-year-old son who was slain in a Mexican beach town while the family was wintering there in February 2013.\n\nAxel liked nothing better than to push himself along on his Strider \u2014 or his \u201cchariot\u201d as his parents called it \u2014 as fast as his chubby little legs would take him.\n\n\u201cIt is bittersweet,\u201d Jen Charrette said about watching other kids on the bikes now. \u201cIt mostly just makes me feel good to remember him in that way.\u201d\n\nInstead of withdrawing into grief, Jen, her husband, Randy, and their oldest son, Kalden, continue to honor Axel by ensuring other kids learn to enjoy cycling. Through their Axel Project foundation they have given away 120 of the beginner Strider bikes and introduced countless kids to the benefits of exercise through Axel Adventure Zones at cycling events like the recent Tour of Utah and the USA Pro Challenge.\n\nOn Saturday, the Charrettes will hold the Axel Project fundraiser bike ride from their town of Ridgway to Telluride and back. More than 80 people who have been moved by Axel\u2019s story are registered to pedal over Dallas Divide.\n\nThe riders are from around the country and did include pro racer Tom Danielson, who recently won the Tour of Utah and was second in the Pro Challenge. But Danielson\u2019s successes, and his team\u2019s new schedule for him, forced him to withdraw from the Axel ride this week \u2014 but not to pull back on his support for the cause.\n\nDanielson has promised to collaborate with the Charrettes on a fundraising ride in Boulder at Thanksgiving.\n\nWhile the Charrettes have been devoting themselves to building the Axel Project, they have also been working to make sure Axel\u2019s suspected killer and an accomplice are prosecuted in Mexico. The two have been held in a Mexican jail since the day of the slaying.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a long process,\u201d Randy Charrette said. \u201cThey are still in the middle of the trial.\u201d\n\nThe Charrettes have retained a lawyer in Mexico to keep them informed about the case. The Mexican Consulate in Puerto Vallarta also has been helpful, Randy said.\n\nEleodoro Carlos Rodriguez Sanchez is standing trial on charges of rape and murder. His former girlfriend, Nancy Saralee Solorio Perez, is being tried for homicide because she allegedly did nothing to stop the killing after she let Sanchez into the Charrettes\u2019 gated rental home in Sayulita. She was babysitting the Charrette children.\n\nJen Charrette said when she attends Axel Project events, including the ride and the Strider zones this weekend, she does not focus on those grim circumstances. She stays positive by watching excited kids taking their first spin.\n\nNowadays, she sometimes does that with a baby strapped in a pack.\n\nLars Charrette was born three months ago to the 40-year-old mother who shouldn\u2019t have been able to have more children. Her tubes had been tied after Axel was born. Her chance of getting pregnant was less than 1 percent.\n\n\u201cWe call him our little miracle baby,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd in 10 months or so, she said, Lars will be clambering on a little bike \u2014 just like Axel did.\n\nNancy Lofholm: 970-256-1957, nlofholm@denverpost.com or twitter.com/nlofholm", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Axel Charrette\u2019s memory lives through bicycle project for toddlers", "title": "Axel Charrette\u2019s memory lives through bicycle project for toddlers", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/29/axel-charrettes-memory-lives-through-bicycle-project-for-toddlers/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140829__axel-project-coloradop1.jpg", "height": 434}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140829__axel-project-coloradop1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-29T14:46:52+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T11:57:12+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "On Saturday, the Charrettes will hold the Axel Project fundraiser bike ride from their town of Ridgway to Telluride and back.\nWhile the Charrettes have been devoting themselves to building the Axel Project, they have also been working to make sure Axel\u2019s suspected killer and an accomplice are prosecuted in Mexico.\nBut Danielson\u2019s successes, and his team\u2019s new schedule for him, forced him to withdraw from the Axel ride this week \u2014 but not to pull back on his support for the cause.\nJen Charrette said when she attends Axel Project events, including the ride and the Strider zones this weekend, she does not focus on those grim circumstances.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a long process,\u201d Randy Charrette said."}
