The last day of open enrollment for individuals under the Affordable Care Act is March 31.\n\nVimo estimates that 83% of the city\u2019s immigrants are eligible to sign up for the state exchange.\n\n\u201cWe know anecdotally from the calls we are getting that the message hasn\u2019t gotten out there,\u201d Vimo said. \u201cThis is not just an immigration issue, this is a bottom line issue \u2026 What makes an exchange work is having as many people participate as possible.\u201d\n\nMany immigrants without citizenship or green cards are eligible for Affordable Care Act plans and could face IRS fines if they remain uninsured. (Win McNamee/Getty Images)\n\nPalestinian immigrant Maha Attieh, a health program manager at Brooklyn\u2019s Arab-American Family Support Center, has been working for months as an Obamacare \u201cnavigator\u201d or in-person counselor.\n\nOne of the fellow immigrants she helped sign up was her husband \u2014 who had gone two years without insurance, Attieh said.\n\n\u201cI tell people that health insurance, you need it. It\u2019s the law now,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are learning about it by word of mouth.\u201d\n\nNavigating the exchange can be confusing \u2014 even if English is a person\u2019s first language.\n\nAffordable Care Act plans are not limited to U.S. citizens or green card holders. Many immigrants who have temporary permission to be here \u2014 such as protected status after a natural disaster in their homeland or U visas after being the victim of a crime \u2014 also can qualify and face fines from the IRS if they remain uninsured.\n\nWhile undocumented immigrants are not eligible, their U.S.-born kids are \u2014 and Immigration and Customs Enforcement released a special memo last October explaining it will not use any information people provide to the government to determine whether they or family members can get coverage under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nVimo says it's vital to maximize numbers signing up to the state's exchange, so immigrants must be brought up to speed. (Ken Murray/NEW YORK DAILY NEWS)\n\nYoung immigrants who got work permits and Social Security cards through the Obama administration\u2019s special deferred-action-for-childhood-arrivals program are specifically barred from participating. In New York State, however, they may be eligible for Medicaid, depending on income, Vimo said.\n\nEven if the state is able to boost the number of eligible immigrants signing up to its exchange, the relatively high number of undocumented New Yorkers who can\u2019t sign up will have a big impact on local public hospitals \u2014 which are facing cuts in federal Medicaid charity-care reimbursements.\n\nThe cuts were set up because Obamacare aims to sharply reduce the number of uninsured, making public hospitals less likely to get stuck paying for those without insurance. That reasoning falls short in cities like New York, where there are an estimated 625,000 undocumented immigrants.\n\nDelaida Garcia, 37, an undocumented Mexican immigrant, attended a Brooklyn town hall meeting about health reform earlier this month \u2014 hoping to find an option for herself and her husband.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure where to look or if I could apply for something. It\u2019s still really important to look for information and help,\u201d said Garcia. \u201cWe would really like to get insurance, so I\u2019m hoping in the future that the opportunity will be there.\u201d\n\nepearson@nydailynews.com", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "ERICA PEARSON", "twitter": {"description": "In New York City, noncitizens are four times more likely than citizens to lack health insurance \u2014 but not enough immigrants are signing up for the state\u2019s exchange under Obamacare, advocates worry.
