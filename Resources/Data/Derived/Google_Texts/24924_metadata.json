Ruben Diaz, right, in the Bronx on Tuesday. Astorino dismisses the perception that he can't unseat Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo. (Photo: Jim Fitzgerald/AP)\n\nRob Astorino commands a local bully pulpit as Westchester County executive, but as the gubernatorial challenger with little statewide recognition and just a fraction of the funding his opponent has amassed, he's had to get creative.\n\nFrom a spoof video about Gov. Andrew Cuomo killing unicorns and a spot in which his 11-year-old son gives the state Democrats' standard-bearer a tongue-lashing to crashing a speech in an attempt to force candidate debates, the campaign has gained attention for its quirkiness. But his campaign has yet to resonate with the public, and polls show him at least 20 percentage points behind Cuomo.\n\n\"Astorino's in a bad place. I mean he doesn't have money, he's down in the polls. National Republicans have essentially abandoned him,\" said Douglas Muzzio, a political science professor at Baruch College in Manhattan. \"He's got to go offbeat and sort of fresh and different.\"\n\nAstorino, 47, has twice been elected county executive in Westchester, where Democrats outnumber GOP voters by 2-to-1. He started his political career at age 21 on a local school board.\n\nHe believes he can replicate his political success on a statewide level, where Democrats likewise have twice as many enrolled voters than Republicans. Election Day is Nov. 4.\n\n\"I could not have gotten elected without Democrats voting for me in a county like Westchester, just like I can't get elected governor without enough Democrats voting for me,\" he said during a recent interview in his campaign office.\n\nAstorino had about $1.3 million to Cuomo's $23.7 million in early October, and the governor had a 20 percentage point lead in a recent Quinnipiac University poll. Astorino was in a similar position in 2009, when then-County Executive Andrew Spano, a Democrat, outspent him 5-to-1 and had a large lead in internal polls, he said.\n\nSome consider Astorino, a former sports and Catholic radio program director and broadcaster, too conservative to have statewide appeal. Others disagree. He has focused on issues that cross political boundaries, such as taxes, although he has angered liberal groups by actions like cuts in child-care subsidies and being pro-life on abortion.\n\nNew Rochelle Mayor Noam Bramson, who unsuccessfully tried to unseat him last year, contended Astorino is a \"very conservative ideologue\" who opposes abortion, gay marriage and the SAFE Act, a 2013 state law that strengthened gun safety standards. Astorino is against abortion except in cases of rape or incest and opposes legislation to update New York's abortion laws.\n\n\"I think Rob is a talented politician who presents a genial, pleasant demeanor, and many people assume that that personal style reflects political moderation, and it does not,\" Bramson said.\n\nBut political ally Tony Sayegh Jr., an Eastchester Republican, said being elected in an overwhelmingly Democratic county shows Astorino has broad appeal. The county executive received a significant number of votes from the black and Hispanic communities last year, he said.\n\n\"Clearly the majority of voters don't view him through a political or ideological prism,\" said Sayegh, a political analyst who appears on the Fox News Network.\n\nSayegh, who met Astorino in the early 2000s, said it was clear to him and others that \"here was a guy who certainly had a future in politics, who was articulate, who was dynamic and certainly a refreshing voice for our party.\"\n\nWhy run for governor?\n\nAstorino, a Mount Vernon native who moved to Mount Pleasant when he was 10, said he wants the state's top job \"because we are losing badly as a state.\"\n\n\"We've got the worst business climate, the worst economic outlook. We have the worst state to retire in, according to the AARP. It's the worst state for small businesses,\" he said.\n\nAstorino is quick to say Cuomo is \"under federal investigation,\" referring to the Moreland Commission on Public Corruption. The governor created the panel in 2013 and abruptly shut it down in the spring. Cuomo has said the panel served its purpose by adopting anti-corruption legislation.\n\nU.S. Attorney Preet Bharara is probing Cuomo's decision to disband the commission before its work was done and potential obstruction of justice and witness-tampering.\n\nCuomo, meanwhile, has all but ignored Astorino, who originally wanted eight regional debates. The only debate both have agreed on was last week in Buffalo with the Green and Libertarian party candidates. Cuomo shook Astorino's hand and then patted him on the shoulder when Astorino confronted him at an event last month to ask for debates.\n\nThe governor is following the traditional campaign play book, Muzzio said. \"You can't put your foot in mouth if you don't open it,\" he said.\n\nCatching the political 'bug'\n\nAstorino said he first got involved in politics nearly 30 years ago, when he worked with Mount Pleasant neighbors and friends who were unhappy about overdevelopment and other issues and got their candidates elected. \"Maybe I caught the political bug there,\" he said.\n\nHe was elected to the Mount Pleasant school board in 1988, when he was 21 and a Fordham University senior studying communications, Spanish and political science. He then served 12 years on the Town Board, six as deputy supervisor. He was a county legislator for one term. In 2005, he ran for county executive and lost to Spano. He unseated the three-term incumbent in 2009 and was elected to a second four-year term last year.\n\nBefore working full time in politics, Astorino built a career in radio broadcasting and programming. His first job was \"flying 5,000 feet over the metropolitan area\" to report on traffic. Disney hired him in 2001 to launch ESPN Radio In New York, where he \"got to go to all the major sporting events and see Derek Jeter on the field, off the field and follow his wonderful career and just be a part of the greatest sports scene in America.\"\n\nAstorino left to campaign full time in fall 2005. He was hired by the New York Archdiocese and what is now Sirius XM Satellite Radio to launch the Catholic Channel in 2006. He was program director and hosted the \"Conversation with the Cardinal\" show with Cardinal Edward Egan and later Cardinal Timothy Dolan.\n\nHe's in his second marriage. Astorino and his current wife, Sheila, had their third child, Ashlin, soon before he was elected in 2009. Sean is 11 and Kiley is 9. He has highlighted his young family in ads: Sean appeared in a video chastising Cuomo for cutting him out of a photo the campaign used of the father and son at a Miami Dolphins game.\n\nHe has also had to deflect criticism about his father, former Mount Vernon Detective Lt. Robert Astorino, who was sentenced in 1994 to a year and a day in prison for stealing government money and conspiring to violate the rights of a fugitive.\n\nHe and two other detectives were caught up in an FBI sting operation in which they were sent to arrest a fictitious fugitive. Astorino took $2,300 from a gym bag full of cash that had been stashed in a closet. The other detectives also took money.\n\n\"He made a mistake and paid his price,\" Astorino said of his father during a 2005 interview with The Journal News. \"It was one of the worst times in my life. But we as a family, and my relationship with my father, got stronger.\"\n\nPlenty of critics\n\nSince becoming county executive, Astorino has kept his hand in radio. He earned $100,000 in consulting fees between 2010 and 2013 from Townsquare Media of Greenwich, Connecticut, as well as $1,800 in 2013 to fill in on WOR radio in Manhattan. He has taken heat from Democrats for earning the income while working his full-time job as county executive, and for clearing the position with the county attorney and not the ethics board.\n\nThe Astorino Truth Squad, funded by the Westchester Democratic Committee, has worked against Astorino as he campaigns. It keeps a running tally of how much time he has spent outside Westchester at www.whereisrob.com and how much it thinks he should reimburse the county for his absence.\n\nThe Truth Squad has monitored Astorino's public comments on the campaign trail and offered its version of events, said Michael Morey, senior vice president at SKDKnickerbocker. One example is a 2.2 percent tax cut in 2010 that Astorino takes credit for, but he vetoed the legislation and lawmakers overrode him.\n\nThe county executive issued the veto because lawmakers wanted to borrow from the county reserve fund, said Astorino campaign adviser Bill O'Reilly.\n\n\"The so-called 'Truth Squad' is a Cuomo mudslinging machine unsuccessfully purporting to be an independent group,\" he said.\n\nThe Board of Legislators under former Chairman Ken Jenkins, D-Yonkers, clashed with Astorino on many issues, including how to meet the terms of a controversial affordable housing settlement with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Astorino disputes HUD's finding that the county's analysis of local zoning is inadequate. The agency has withheld more than $20 million in community development grants because of the disagreement.\n\nJenkins said the county executive is not a compromiser. \"Unless it was exactly the county executive's way then he didn't want to budge on his position,\" said Jenkins, who as chairman initiated several lawsuits against the administration.\n\nAstorino described Jenkins as \"a professional agitator\" and said he has \"broken through the impasse\" with the current board of legislators' leadership.\n\nAstorino wants to replace the Common Core with standards and curriculum developed by New York educators, with more feedback from teachers and parents, and more local control. Some of the criticisms of the national standards are they were implemented too fast, were untested and are too difficult for younger grades.\n\n\"I want higher standards, I absolutely want higher standards, but I don't want federal bureaucrats in Washington, D.C., guiding education decisions in New York,\" he said.\n\nTwitter: @caraloumatthews\n\nRob Astorino\n\nAge: 47\n\nCurrent job: Westchester County executive\n\nPrevious jobs: Station manager and program director, the Catholic Channel on Sirius-XM Satellite radio; senior producer, ESPN Radio\n\nPrevious political experience: Mount Pleasant school board member, Mount Pleasant Town Board member, Westchester County legislator.\n\nHometown: Mount Pleasant\n\nFamily: Married to Sheila Astorino, three children\n\nTop issues\n\nCut spending, reduce state mandates on local governments and make New York more business-friendly, which would spur job growth.\n\nReplace the national Common Core standards with ones that are locally developed, with input from teachers and parents, and provide more local control.\n\nImplement a 10-point ethics plan to clean up Albany, including term limits and stripping public pensions from elected officials convicted of corruption.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://lohud.us/1tUGFC6", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Cuomo's challenger gets creative for funding", "og": {"site_name": "lohud.com", "description": "Cuomo's challenger gets creative for funding", "title": "Astorino, GOP say Albany within reach", "url": "http://www.lohud.com/story/news/politics/albany-watch/2014/10/25/astorino-gop-say-albany-within-reach/17938673/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/lohud.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Cuomo's challenger gets creative for funding", "title": "Astorino, GOP say Albany within reach", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7a0ed4ada9ae3f00c5559e217887c49740bab914/c=608-0-3040-2432&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Westchester/None/2014/10/25/635498768619036715-Governor-New-York-Astorino-GQN8TUQC8.1.jpg", "creator": "@lohud", "site": "@lohud", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600070416", "fb": {"app_id": 169889109713077}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb05a\"", "article_summary": "Astorino, 47, has twice been elected county executive in Westchester, where Democrats outnumber GOP voters by 2-to-1.\nThe county executive issued the veto because lawmakers wanted to borrow from the county reserve fund, said Astorino campaign adviser Bill O'Reilly.\nWestchester County Executive Rob Astorino, left, the Republican candidate for governor of New York, campaigns with state Sen.
