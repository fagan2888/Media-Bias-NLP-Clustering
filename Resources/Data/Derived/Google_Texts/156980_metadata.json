But it is true that Barack Obama has been president for the past four-and-a-half years, during which time the economy has gotten this way, and this must be his fault because leadership.\n\nIn fact, Cruz\u2019 statement represents a vindication of Occupy Wall Street (seriously), the allegedly brief and rudderless movement whose clearest\u2014or, better to say, least-unclear\u2014goal was precisely to make inequality a part of the political conversation, as most conveniently manifested by the divide between \u201cthe one percent\u201d and \u201cthe 99 percent.\u201d If Cruz is anything, he is a demagogue; he wouldn\u2019t be making these noises if he didn\u2019t believe his listeners wanted to hear them. And why shouldn\u2019t they? By definition, most of his supporters are in the 99 percent.\n\nOn a slightly less serious note, I think others whose concern for income and wealth inequality in America matches\u2014or even exceeds!\u2014Ted Cruz\u2019 should welcome him into their fold with the same earnestness with which he has endeavored to join it, and should extend him the same solidarity he appears to wish to extend to them. In that spirit, here are a few modestly submitted things Cruz can do in order to address the issue he has raised:\n\n\u2022 Stop trying to discredit the Affordable Care Act, which among other things is significantly redistributionist, levying an average $52,000 tax increase on the aforementioned one percent in order to subsidize the health insurance of the less-well-off. And try to resist shutting down the government in an effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act again.\n\n\u2022 Abandon your advocacy for a flat tax. True, the American taxpayers might save a little money once they no longer have to fund the Internal Revenue Service (although it isn\u2019t clear why you wouldn\u2019t still want adequate enforcement of this tax, but never mind). But since the flat tax would impose the same rate on everyone, it would definitely be worse for after-tax wealth and income inequality than the current progressive income tax system the federal government runs.\n\n\u2022 Endorse Bill de Blasio for New York City mayor. There\u2019s still time\u2014the election\u2019s not until next month!\n\n\u2022 Maybe stop opposing raises of the estate and capital gains taxes, both of which are disproportionately paid by the high-earning and wealthy.\n\n\u2022 Relatedly, don\u2019t take hundreds of thousands of dollars from the financial services industry, whose light regulation enables it to focus obsessively on profits and thereby turn out a lot of people whose stupendous wealth is disproportionate to their contribution to the economy.\n\n\u2022 Finally, don\u2019t tell your wife about your new beliefs. After all, as a managing director at Goldman Sachs, she benefits from the same laissez-faire positions that exacerbate all this confounded inequality.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "At a dinner Wednesday night thrown by the conservative American Spectator magazine, America crazy-person flavor-of-the-month Ted Cruz reportedly uttered something rather surprising.
