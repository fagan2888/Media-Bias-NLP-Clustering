Seventy-seven percent said they planned to delay an action or purchasing major household items and 75 percent said they would spend less on food, clothing, and basic household items. Another 38 percent said they would pay the health care costs by increasing their credit card debt and 37 percent said they would resort to borrowing money from family and friends.\n\nThe report did not find that the insured had significantly fewer problems than the uninsured in paying their medical bills. Forty-four percent of the insured said they had problems with medical bills and 45 percent of the uninsured said the same.\n\n\u201cWhile insurance can protect people from problem medical bills, the survey suggests that those with employer coverage or other insurance suffer similar consequences as the uninsured once such problems occur,\u201d the report states.\n\nMany who were insured reported skipping or putting off health care in the past year. Sixty-two percent said they postponed dental care, 43 percent said they skipped doctor-recommended tests and treatments, and 41 percent went without filling a prescription.\n\nThirty-one percent of those having problems paying their medical bills said the total reached at least $5,000 and 13 percent of those said their total reached $10,000.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to requests for comment by press time.", "article_metadata": {"description": "One in five Americans with health insurance is having problems paying medical bills and many are making financial, lifestyle sacrifices to foot the bill.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "One in five Americans with health insurance is\u00a0having problems paying medical bills and many are making financial and lifestyle sacrifices to foot the cost, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation po", "title": "Report: Americans Making Financial and Lifestyle Sacrifices to Pay for Health Care", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/issues/report-americans-making-financial-and-lifestyle-sacrifices-to-pay-for-health-care/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/serious-doctor-150x150.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "One in five Americans with health insurance is\u00a0having problems paying medical bills and many are ma", "title": "Report: Americans Making Financial and Lifestyle Sacrifices to Pay for Health Care", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/serious-doctor-150x150.jpg", "creator": "@DJAliMeyer", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID", "pages": 282024895179874}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "BY: Follow @DJAliMeyerOne in five Americans with health insurance is having problems paying medical bills and many are making financial and lifestyle sacrifices to foot the cost, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation poll.\nThirty-one percent of those having problems paying their medical bills said the total reached at least $5,000 and 13 percent of those said their total reached $10,000.\n\u201cPeople with insurance who face problem medical bills also report a wide range of consequences and sacrifices during the past year as a result,\u201d the report states.\nAnother 38 percent said they would pay the health care costs by increasing their credit card debt and 37 percent said they would resort to borrowing money from family and friends.\nThe report did not find that the insured had significantly fewer problems than the uninsured in paying their medical bills."}
