Early on Thursday morning, Charleston Police Chief Greg Mullen released photos taken from the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church of the suspect, as well as a black sedan he was seen leaving in.

The suspect, who has not been identified, remains on the loose. Mullen told reporters there was "no reason to believe" he was not still in the Charleston area.
