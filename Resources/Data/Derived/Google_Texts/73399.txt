According to a new report ( link in German, via 9To5Mac ) from Manager Magazin’s July issue, Apple CEO Tim Cook and other Apple execs recently met with BMW counterparts in Leipzig, Germany to visit the carmaker’s i3 production line.

The publication said that Cook met with BMW senior officials and was reportedly ‘impressed’ with the automaker’s first all electric effort.

Apple is allegedly interested in using BMW’s i3 carbon fiber body as a basis for its own electric car project, according to the report.

Back in March, BMW denied the i3 is going to be the Apple Car. However, BMW chief production officer Oliver Zipse told Reuters this month that BMW is open to building cars for other companies such as Google (GOOG),(GOOGL) or Apple (AAPL).

“We live in a world of partnerships,” Zipse said when asked whether BMW could imagine building a car for a software or computer company such as Apple.

The magazine ads that negotiations between the two companies have been ongoing since autumn 2014, but that no deal is in place.
