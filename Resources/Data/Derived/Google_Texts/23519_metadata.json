He also has a couple of fund-raisers to attend. If he\u2019s not satisfied with the eats at them (who knows whether they\u2019ll be rubber-chicken events), he might be wondering where he can get a great bite.\n\nForget about Lucia: Word on the street is that no tables are set aside for VIPs there \u2014 even Jennifer Uygur\u2019s mom can\u2019t get a table unless she calls a month ahead on the first day of the month like everyone else. So forget about that. Unless he wants to take his chances and try to get a seat at the chef\u2019s counter \u2014 there might even be room there for three Secret Service guys to sit next to him.\n\nThe president might be interested in seeing what all the fuss at FT33 is about \u2014 after all, chef-owner Matt McCallister was just named The Dallas Morning News\u2019 first-ever Chef of the Year. So that\u2019s an idea. He could go to Hibiscus or Al Biernat\u2019s, and feast on some fabulous locally-raised grass fed beef.\n\nOr he might want to play it lower-key, and spend a more quiet evening eating something soothing and delicious. In that case, I\u2019d head to Mesa Veracruz Coastal Cuisine. I understand it\u2019s only busy on weekends, so that should be no problem \u2014 and it\u2019s probably an ideal situation in terms of the Secret Service securing the space. Bonus: the president reportedly loves mom and pop places, and Mesa fits that bill (as do FT33 and Lucia). Mr. President, if you go to Mesa, please do not miss the enmoladas \u2014 Olga Reyes\u2018 wonderful hand-made corn tortillas layered with her fabulous mole sauce and folded into neat packets \u2014 and then have the cochinita pib\u00edl. And be sure to have a Meso-Rita \u2014 which may well be the best margarita in town.\n\nMaybe you have a great idea of where the president should dine post-rubber-chicken fest. Please let him know in a comment!\n\nFollow Leslie on Facebook\n\nFollow @lesbren\n\n", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL2VhdHNibG9nLmRhbGxhc25ld3MuY29tLzIwMTMvMTEvZm9yZ2V0LWx1Y2lhLW5vdC1ldmVuLXByZXNpZGVudC1vYmFtYS1jb3VsZC1zbmFnLWEtdGFibGUtdGhlcmUtaGVyZXMtd2hlcmUtaGUtc2hvdWxkLWVhdC10b25pZ2h0LWlmLWhlcy1oYWQtZW5vdWdoLXJ1YmJlci1jaGlja2VuLmh0bWwv", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Leslie Brenner", "og": {"site_name": "Eats Blog", "description": "&nbsp; President Obama will be in Dallas today to encourage uninsured Texans to sign up for health care coverage under the Affordable Care Act.
