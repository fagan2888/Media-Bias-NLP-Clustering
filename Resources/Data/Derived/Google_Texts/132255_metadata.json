Kennedy, in an unusual separate opinion in a case, wrote that it may be time for judges to limit the use of long-term solitary confinement in prisons.\n\nHis comments accompanying a decision issued Thursday marked a rare instance of a Supreme Court justice virtually inviting a constitutional challenge to a prison policy.\n\n\u201cYears on end of near-total isolation exacts a terrible price,\u201d he wrote. He cited the writings of Charles Dickens and 19th century Supreme Court opinions that recognized \u201ceven for prisoners sentenced to death, solitary confinement bears \u2018a further terror and a peculiar mark of infamy.\u2019\u201d\n\nSentencing judges and the high court have largely ignored the issue, Kennedy said, focusing their attention on questions of guilt or innocence or on the constitutionality of the death penalty.\n\n\u201cIn a case that presented the issue, the judiciary may be required,\u201d he wrote, \u201cto determine whether workable alternative systems for long-term confinement exist, and, if so, whether a correctional system should be required to adopt them.\u201d\n\nAmy Fettig, an attorney for the ACLU\u2019s National Prison Project, said Kennedy's comments came as a welcome surprise.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a remarkable statement. The justice is sending a strong signal he is deeply concerned about the overuse and abuse of solitary confinement,\u201d she said.\n\nStates such as Virginia and Texas routinely put death-row inmates in solitary confinement, she said. \u201cThey are automatically placed there. It has nothing to do with their being violent or their level of dangerousness,\u201d she said.\n\nThis month, a federal judge in Virginia is weighing a \u201ccruel and unusual punishment\u201d claim brought by inmates on death row there, she noted.\n\nKennedy usually joins with the court\u2019s conservatives in cases involving crime and punishment, but he has also voiced concern over prison policies that he deems unduly harsh. These include life terms for juveniles and long mandatory prison terms for nonviolent drug crimes. Four years ago, he spoke for a 5-4 majority that condemned overcrowding in California\u2019s prisons and said it resulted in unconstitutionally cruel conditions.\n\nBoth sides of Kennedy\u2019s views were evident in Thursday\u2019s decision. He joined a 5-4 majority to reject a San Diego murderer\u2019s bid for a new trial, but wrote separately to raise the issue of possible constitutional limits to solitary confinement.\n\nThe case before the court involved Hector Ayala, who had been convicted and sentenced to die for shooting to death three men in the attempted robbery of an auto body shop in 1985. A fourth man had been shot, but survived and identified Ayala as the shooter.\n\nAyala has been on California's death row ever since his conviction a generation ago. The California courts upheld his conviction and death sentence, but two years ago a U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals panel overturned both. In a 2-1 decision, the appeals court cited the trial judge\u2019s decision permitting prosecutors to remove all seven of the blacks and Latinos who were considered for the jury.\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed that decision and restored Ayala\u2019s conviction and death sentence. Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. said the \u201cconscientious trial judge\u201d had spoken to each of the potential jurors and decided the prosecutor was justified in removing them. \u201cHis judgment was entitled to great weight,\u201d he concluded.\n\nIn his separate opinion, Kennedy said he agreed Alito\u2019s opinion was \u201ccomplete and correct,\u201d but said he was nonetheless troubled to learn Ayala had been kept in solitary confinement. This means he has \u201cbeen held for all or most of the past 20 years or more in a windowless cell no larger than a typical parking spot for 23 hours a day,\u201d he wrote. An estimated 25,000 inmates in the United States are being held in solitary confinement without regard to their conduct in prison, he added.\n\nKennedy's comments drew a short, but sharp retort from Justice Clarence Thomas.\n\n\u201cThe accommodations in which Ayala is housed are a far sight more spacious than those in which his victims \u2026 now rest. And, given that his victims were all 31 years or age or under, Ayala will soon have had as much or more time to enjoy those accommodations as his victims had time to enjoy this Earth,\u201d Thomas wrote.\n\nFor more on the Supreme Court, follow @DavidGSavage.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Justice Kennedy practically invites a challenge to solitary confinement", "Description": "Supreme Court Justice Anthony M.
