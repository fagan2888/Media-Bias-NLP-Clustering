They got their wish. After November\u2019s surprisingly strong job growth, those rooting for the U.S. economy hoped to see the country end the year on a strong note. They got their wish.\n\nThe new report from Bureau of Labor Statistics shows the U.S. economy added 252,000 jobs in December. The overall unemployment rate dropped to 5.6%, its lowest point since June 2008 \u2013 six-and-a-half years ago.\n\nOnce again, public-sector layoffs did not drag down the overall employment figures. Though jobs reports over the last few years have shown monthly government job losses, in December, the private sector added 240,000 while the public sector added 23,000. The latter may not sound like much, but after several years in which that total was negative, it\u2019s encouraging.\n\nAs for the revisions, all of the news was once again excellent: October\u2019s totals were revised up from 243,000 to 261,000, while November\u2019s figures were revised up, from 321,000 to 353,000. Combined, that\u2019s an additional 50,000 jobs.\n\nAll told, these totals may not be quite as stunning as last month\u2019s figures, but this is still a strong jobs report. Just as important, it wraps up an impressive year \u2013 in 2014, the U.S. economy added over 2.95 million jobs overall and 2.86 million in the private sector. What\u2019s more, November was the 51st consecutive month of positive job growth \u2013 the best stretch since 1939 \u2013 and the 57th consecutive month in which we\u2019ve seen private-sector job growth, which is the longest on record.\n\nLast year was easily the best year for U.S. job creation since 1999, which Republicans may struggle to explain in light of the Affordable Care Act, higher taxes, and federal regulations.\n\nAbove you\u2019ll find the chart I run every month, showing monthly job losses since the start of the Great Recession.
