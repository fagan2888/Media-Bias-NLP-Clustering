MINNEAPOLIS — Hitting third in the All-Star Game is both an honor and a burden, but one Rockies shortstop Troy Tulowitzki embraces.

“Not too many guys can say they hit third for an all-star team,” Tulo said Tuesday, about three hours before the 85th All-Star Game at Target Field. “No doubt it’s cool, but if you are hitting third, the lineup is depending on you, so hopefully I get some good at-bats. Maybe I get some runners in scoring position and I make the most of it.”

This is the fourth time Tulowitzki has been selected to the All-Star Game, but only the third time he’ll play in the game. He was inactive in 2010 because of a broken wrist.

He’s approaching No. 4 with a cooler head.

“My first couple of All-Star Games, I was running around with my head cut off until five minutes until the national anthem started,” he said. “Now I understand a little better what I need to do to prepare. I’m giving myself enough time to go out there and prepare.”

Derby day. Tulo didn’t far particularly well in Monday night’s Home Run Derby, getting bumped out in the second round by Cincinnati’s Todd Frazier. He hit a total of six home runs.

Still, Tulo, who captained the NL squad, had a fantastic night.

“Whenever I think about the Home Run Derby, I think about my time as a kid, watching it on TV,” he said. “To have a chance to participate in it was something special. Obviously, competitive side would have liked to have done better, but at the same time, I enjoyed it and it was something I will always remember.”
