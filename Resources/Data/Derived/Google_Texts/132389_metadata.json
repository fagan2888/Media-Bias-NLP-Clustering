Baker III.\n\nThe secret diplomatic machinations have been dizzying, and sometimes disorienting. President Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry have opened doors and created opportunities for settling intractable conflicts. But the administration\u2019s turnabouts, especially in the Middle East, have been so sudden and unsentimental that Machiavelli himself might blush.\n\nThe Iran nuclear agreement was the most striking example of the willingness to engage former adversaries. In his speech last weekend to the Saban Forum in Washington, Obama made the case that it\u2019s worth experimenting to see if Iran\u2019s drive toward nuclear weapons can be reversed through diplomacy. He gave his gambit a 50 percent chance of success; given that war is a possible alternative, that\u2019s a reasonable wager.\n\nIsraelis I talked to afterward were impressed (if not always convinced) by the dry, precise clarity of Obama\u2019s argument for testing the Iranians. We\u2019ll find out next year whether Obama meant it when he said that a bad deal (i.e., one that didn\u2019t make sure the Iranian program remains peaceful for years to come) would be worse than none at all.\n\n1 of 20 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Top opinions stories of 2013 View Photos From Trayvon Martin to Obamacare: Take a look at a selection of the stories that caught readers\u2019 interests over the past year.

The feelers went out back in 2012, when Hillary Clinton was secretary of state and the fire-breathing Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was president of Iran. A back channel was provided by the sultan of Oman, an eccentric character worthy of a spy novel, who learned the arts of clandestine activity from the masters, the British. These covert contacts accelerated when Hassan Rouhani was elected president last June, but they were blessed first by Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.\n\nKerry has even taken on the Rubik\u2019s Cube of diplomacy, the Israeli-Palestinian problem. His argument to both sides, at bottom, has been ruthlessly practical: Begin the transition to Palestinian statehood now, or you\u2019ll regret it later.\n\nWatching the administration\u2019s gyrations on Syria has been less encouraging. Obama shied for more than a year from a serious program to train and arm Syria\u2019s moderate opposition. Had he done the right thing back in mid-2012, the rebels today might have up to 10,000 CIA-trained fighters, who could have prevented al-Qaeda from recapturing the Euphrates Valley. Now, with the bootless moderate opposition shattered and al-Qaeda surging, Obama reportedly has decided to work with Saudi Arabia and its Islamic Front, a not-quite-jihadist group eerily reminiscent of the warlords the United States backed in Afghanistan in the 1980s.\n\nGiven the dismal options available, this latest revision of Syria policy makes sense if it draws the Islamists toward moderation and an eventual political settlement in Syria. But it sits uneasily with the other pieces of the administration\u2019s Syria portfolio \u2014 its decision to work with Russia to dismantle Syria\u2019s chemical weapons and its support for a Geneva conference in January to plan a political transition (or perhaps, just organize safe zones for humanitarian relief this winter).\n\n\u201cA hasty solution in Syria is just as harmful as doing nothing,\u201d cautions Samir al-Taqi, a Syrian exile who runs a think tank here. He argues that a shattered Syria can be put back together only slowly, region by region. And he warns that President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s Alawite-led army will never suppress al-Qaeda: As the United States learned in Iraq, he argues, the best weapon against the Sunni insurgency fomented by al-Qaeda is a Sunni counterinsurgency.\n\nEgypt is another area where I get dizzy trying to follow administration policy. The United States remained supportive of the Muslim Brotherhood government long after most Egyptians had rejected it last summer; after months of waffling, the United States recently seems to have made the \u201crealist\u201d decision to work with Egypt\u2019s friends in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to stabilize its economy and, if possible, push it back toward civilian government.\n\nThe 2013 realpolitik tour continues here in the oil kingdoms of the Gulf. The Saudis and Emiratis were so upset by Obama\u2019s opening to Iran and dithering on Syria that they threatened a revolt from decades of alliance with the United States. Though Obama seems more than fed up with hectoring from Saudi Arabia, he again opted for the conciliatory, diplomatic approach. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel was in Bahrain last weekend, reassuring the Gulf Arabs and reminding them just how much the United States spends on their security.\n\n1 of 156 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 The best editorial cartoons of 2013 (so far) View Photos A collection of cartoons from around the country.

But critics should recognize that this is interests-based foreign policy in its raw form.\n\nRead more from David Ignatius\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.", "article_metadata": {"description": "From Iran to Egypt, Syria to the Gulf, relentlessly pragmatic diplomacy.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/davidignatiusbooks", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "From Iran to Egypt, Syria to the Gulf, relentlessly pragmatic diplomacy.", "title": "David Ignatius: Obama\u2019s relentlessly pragmatic diplomacy", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/david-ignatius-obamas-relentlessly-pragmatic-diplomacy/2013/12/11/cfa54768-61e4-11e3-8beb-3f9a9942850f_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2013/12/11/Editorial-Opinion/Images/179434048.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@ignatiuspost"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/david-ignatius-obamas-relentlessly-pragmatic-diplomacy/2013/12/11/cfa54768-61e4-11e3-8beb-3f9a9942850f_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "David Ignatius, david ignatius column, david ignatius washington post, obama foreign policy, obama realpoliik, obama international issues, obama syria, obama egypt, obama middle east, obama bahrain, obama saudi arabia, obama israel, obama palestinians, john kerry middle east, kerry israel, kerry palestinians", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/davidignatiusbooks"}, "eomportal-uuid": "cfa54768-61e4-11e3-8beb-3f9a9942850f", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "David Ignatius, david ignatius column, david ignatius washington post, obama foreign policy, obama realpoliik, obama international issues, obama syria, obama egypt, obama middle east, obama bahrain, obama saudi arabia, obama israel, obama palestinians, john kerry middle east, kerry israel, kerry palestinians"}, "article_summary": "President Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry have opened doors and created opportunities for settling intractable conflicts.\nDefense Secretary Chuck Hagel was in Bahrain last weekend, reassuring the Gulf Arabs and reminding them just how much the United States spends on their security.\nThe Saudis and Emiratis were so upset by Obama\u2019s opening to Iran and dithering on Syria that they threatened a revolt from decades of alliance with the United States.\nWhy liberals are panicked about Obamacare If Obamacare fails, \u201cIt will discredit Obama\u2019s new liberalism for years to come.\u201d By Charles Krauthammer Jessica Rinaldi/Reuters Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue.\nRead more from David Ignatius\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook."}
