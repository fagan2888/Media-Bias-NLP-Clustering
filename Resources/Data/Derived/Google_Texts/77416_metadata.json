As a newspaper editorial writer and editor, I\u2019ve been waiting a long time for this one, having fought two publisher bosses in two different cities, going back to the mid-1990s, to editorialize in favor of gay marriage. I won the second fight, but barely, at The Los Angeles Times, some nine years ago.\n\nA Court decision that relies on our federal constitution to legalize gay marriage across the country would be a triumph for individual liberty, common sense, and human decency. It would also amount to a well-deserved blow against that most persistent of villains throughout American history: the destructive creed of state rights and state sovereignty.\n\nThat same creed is at issue in the Obamacare case that is also expected to be decided this month, as the Court concludes its current term. At first glance, the Affordable Care Act and the institution of gay marriage don\u2019t seem to have much in common as litigation subjects, but this case, too, is as much about the proper relationship between the states and the federal government as it is about anything else \u2013 which is true of so many of our political and legal fights these days.\n\nKing v. Burwell, the Obamacare decision, is a fluke of a case, an opportunity for opponents of the law to take another swing at the pi\u00f1ata (which they damaged, but did not break it in an earlier challenge) by capitalizing on some careless legislative drafting. The law allows the federal government to provide subsidies to lower-income insurance customers who sign up for coverage on the new exchanges \u201cestablished by the state.\u201d Trouble is, pursuant to other sections of the law, it was the federal government that ended up establishing an exchange for those states that refused to establish their own \u2013 and no one involved in drafting the law intended for its patients to be denied the same subsidies available to people signing up for coverage on a state-created exchange. Now, in their feverish desire to interfere with the relationship between American citizens and their national government, opponents of the law are hoping the Supreme Court will cut off 8 million people from the support and coverage they are receiving.\n\nAs we await these landmark decisions that are so of the moment, it\u2019s worth reading Joseph J. Ellis\u2019s new book, The Quartet: Orchestrating the Second American Revolution 1783-1789. It\u2019s a masterful reminder of how timeless this tension is between the concept of the United States as a singular nation and the United States as merely a confederation of sovereign states.\n\nEllis chronicles how four of our more visionary Founding Fathers \u2013 George Washington, John Jay, Alexander Hamilton, and James Madison \u2013 recognized from the earliest days after independence that the individual states, and the excessive power retained by them under the loose Articles of Confederation, were a serious threat to the promise of the American Revolution.\n\nHence this influential \u201cquartet\u201d pushed for the 1787 Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia. Washington\u2019s greatness lay in the fact that, from his earliest days leading the Continental Army, he transcended his narrow identification with Virginia, to think more broadly in terms of an American nation. He came out of self-imposed retirement to lend his enormous credibility to the Philadelphia proceedings. Washington wrote at the time (in what can be read as a challenge to pro-confederation Virginians then, but also to Virginia Confederates who\u2019d secede from the Union in the following century): \u201cWe are either a United people or we are not. If the former, let us, in all matters of general concern act as a nation\u2026 If we are not, let us no longer act a farce by pretending to it.\u201d\n\nEllis captures the rare brilliance and admirable foresight of Washington\u2019s three intellectual partners in this quest \u2013 Jay, Hamilton, and the first president\u2019s fellow Virginian, Madison. All three men had a clear vision of an America destined to be a unique power in the world, defined by its collective sense of purpose and its citizens\u2019 liberty. They understood that to survive, and thrive, as a continental power, the United States needed a stronger national government representing, and protecting, all of its people.\n\nMadison, often cited as the father of the Constitution, lost plenty of battles at Philadelphia, starting with his bedrock insistence that sovereign power be shifted entirely from the states to the central government. Madison gave up on what he initially considered his non-negotiable demand for a federal veto power over state laws, as he would later have to surrender on his proposal that some of the Bill of Rights also limit the power of states. Though the closest of political partners at other times, Madison and Jefferson disagreed vehemently over whether it was state governments or the new federal government that would be the biggest threat to individual liberty and rights, and history has proven Jefferson spectacularly wrong in that debate. It\u2019s hard to blame him: Madison\u2019s (and Hamilton\u2019s) belief that the larger, more distant national government could be a more representative embodiment of \u201cWe the People\u201d was a very modern concept.\n\nBut being so ahead of their time limited The Quartet\u2019s contemporary success. They were able to remedy the immediate flaws of the Articles of Confederation, bind the new nation closer together and set it on the right course, but their new Constitution, by political necessity, was riddled with fraught compromises \u2013 such as the electoral college and the equal vote of each state in the Senate \u2013 whose underlying tensions would define much of American history.\n\nAbraham Lincoln ratified and reinvigorated the Quartet\u2019s accomplishment to the point where he deserves to join Ellis\u2019 crew, and make it a Quintet. The Civil War and its aftermath \u2013 especially the 14th Amendment on which the gay marriage case should hinge \u2013 delivered on the Madisonian concept of a federal government empowered to protect citizens \u2013 especially minorities \u2013 from the bullying of local and state authorities (i.e., majorities). But that doesn\u2019t mean the fight is over.\n\nNowadays we don\u2019t often think about these federalist debates that have haunted our history, because we are too busy \u2013 and this goes for both conservatives and liberals \u2013 gaming the tension between Washington and state capitals. Even within the gay marriage legal fights over the last decade, both sides have taken turns, depending on the prevailing winds, arguing in favor of a state\u2019s right to define marriage for itself, damned what the rest of the country thinks.\n\nToo rarely do we ask ourselves the more fundamental question of whether we are citizens of California or Texas \u2013 or the United States? If the Quartet had invented a time machine and paid us a visit, they\u2019d be astonished at the resilience of the state sovereignty creed, despite all we\u2019ve been through as a nation. Too many Americans stubbornly cling to the belief that the United States is a confederation in which citizens\u2019 fundamental rights \u2013 on issues like marriage, access to baseline health care, and what is taught in their public schools \u2013 can and should vary across state lines, to accommodate local biases.\n\nLet\u2019s hope in the coming days and weeks that five such Americans aren\u2019t sitting on the Supreme Court.\n\nAndr\u00e9s Martinez is the editorial director of Z\u00f3calo Public Square and a professor at the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism at Arizona State University.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Two cases before the Supreme Court point to the long-running battle between state rights and federal authority", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "Two cases before the Supreme Court point to the long-running battle between state rights and federal authority", "title": "This Is What Gay Marriage and Obamacare Have in Common", "url": "http://time.com/3916469/founding-fathers-gay-marriage/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/91222902-copy.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=510", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/91222902-copy.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=510"}, "description": "Two cases before the Supreme Court point to the long-running battle between state rights and federal authority", "site": "TIME", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "This Is What Gay Marriage and Obamacare Have in Common"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "usa, america, supreme, supreme court, obamacare, aca, health care, gay marriage, marriage", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "usa, america, supreme, supreme court, obamacare, aca, health care, gay marriage, marriage"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf8b3\"", "article_summary": "A Court decision that relies on our federal constitution to legalize gay marriage across the country would be a triumph for individual liberty, common sense, and human decency.\nAs a newspaper editorial writer and editor, I\u2019ve been waiting a long time for this one, having fought two publisher bosses in two different cities, going back to the mid-1990s, to editorialize in favor of gay marriage.\nToo rarely do we ask ourselves the more fundamental question of whether we are citizens of California or Texas \u2013 or the United States?\nIt\u2019s a masterful reminder of how timeless this tension is between the concept of the United States as a singular nation and the United States as merely a confederation of sovereign states.\nEven within the gay marriage legal fights over the last decade, both sides have taken turns, depending on the prevailing winds, arguing in favor of a state\u2019s right to define marriage for itself, damned what the rest of the country thinks."}
