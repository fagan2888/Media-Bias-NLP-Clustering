Sioux Falls, SD

At just 25 years old, Wyatt Pickner has accomplished a lot and his colleagues agree.

"Being able to use your experience at such a young age and your educational opportunities at such a young age to develop at the rate that he has, has been pretty impressive," Jen Prasek said.

Following graduation from the University of South Dakota in 2014, Wyatt was hired by Sanford Research.

"Right now we are in phase 3 of the study which is the intervention phase so we have done our date collection," Pickner said.

His role is to look into the quality of care American Indian children are receiving in hospital emergency rooms.

"Especially for children when the go into the emergency department it's already a pretty scary experience so how do we kind of work with them so that it's less scary and more welcoming and inviting," Pickner said.

Over the past few years they have identified some problems.

"There's definitely physicians on the reservations but there's not necessarily pediatricians that are available and sometimes that's where that lack of care comes in," Pickner said.

"The ultimate goal of this project is to improve the level of care that children receive in ER rooms and if this project has sort of any positive impact on that I think that itself speaks volumes in something that can be replicated," Prasek said.

A project that gives communities and reservations a voice and will make a difference in their healthcare for years to come.

"In 5 years we're able to make an impact on care that's being provided for American Indian Children and to me that's just absolutely amazing," Pickner said.
