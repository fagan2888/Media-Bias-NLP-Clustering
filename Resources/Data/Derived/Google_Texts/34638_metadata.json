The item is listed on the menu as \"Rocky Mountain oysters,\" however, if one thinks about it, the chance of finding oysters in the Rocky Mountains \u2013 or any mountains \u2013 is slim to none.\n\nSo what the hay is this new fair fare?\n\n\"Bulls' testicles,\" says Big Sky co-owner Eric Wrigley Schroeder.\n\nBig Sky Country offers a variety of daring food items for breakfast, lunch and dinner, including maple-glazed black pepper bacon and a pork belly burger buster that comes with a side of \"boom boom\" sauce, but the \"oysters\" \u2013 which are available breaded or buffalo style \u2013 are undoubtedly the most daring.\n\nWe sampled the breaded version ($9) and found them less round than we expected. They taste, no joke, a lot like chicken \u2013 or chicken fried steak. A little chewier, but certainly a familiar meat taste. The breading was flavorful with a spicy kick.\n\nSchroeder says he and co-owner Kevin Riley were trepidatious about ordering 200 pounds of bovine testes, but they sold all of them within two days and ordered more.\n\n\"It started out as a joke, but people really like them. A couple from the Southwest, where they are more common, said they were the best they've ever had,\" says Schroeder.\n\nSchroeder opened Big Sky Country last year with Riley. Both men are longtime employees of Kelly's Bleachers and would eventually like to expand Big Sky to a year-round concept somewhere in the city.\n\n\"The name has nothing to do with Montana. It's about driving from Milwaukee to Madison and seeing only fields, the horizon and sky,\" says Schroeder. \"Or when you're driving across Illinois or Indiana and it's all big sky.\"\n\nThis is Big Sky Country's second year at the Fair \u2013 it replaced the Starlight, which was on the fairgrounds for 40 years. This season, Schroeder and Riley added a new speaker system, live bands twice daily and big yellow flags with words \"music,\" \"food\" and \"beer\" on them to alert people they were a bar and restaurant.\n\n\"Because we're on the north end \u2013 the agricultural area \u2013 and we're in a barn-like building, people didn't always realize we had music, beer and food,\" says Schroeder.\n\nSchroeder says some fairgoers have bought the deep-fried bull testicles for friends without telling them what they were eating until after they swallowed a few bites.\n\n\"I thought about even printing at the bottom of the container 'you just ate bulls' testicles.' We're having fun with this,\" he says.\n\nAnd no, the bulls' balls are not served on a stick.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Every year, the Wisconsin State Fair has numerous adventuresome new foods, from chocolate-smothered bacon to deep-fried butter.
