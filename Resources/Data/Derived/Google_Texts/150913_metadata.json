Lockheed Martin Corp agreed last year to pay $62 million to settle a suit that made such claims on behalf of the defense contractor\u2019s 120,000 workers and retirees.\n\n\n\nOfficials overseeing Anthem\u2019s 401(k) plan, which holds more than $5 billion in funds, \u201callowed unreasonable expenses to be charged\u201d and only offered Vanguard funds that were \u201chigh-cost and poor-performing investments,\u201d the workers said in the suit, filed Dec. 29 in Indianapolis federal court.\n\n\n\nMalvern, Pennsylvania-based Vanguard, the biggest U.S. mutual fund provider, also serves as the plan\u2019s record keeper. Vanguard wasn\u2019t named as a defendant in the suit.\n\n\n\nJill Becher, a spokeswoman for Anthem, the third-largest health insurer in the U.S. by market value, declined to comment on the lawsuit.\n\n\n\nAnthem\u2019s plan managers selected the higher-cost Vanguard offerings for the fund lineup and ignored identical lower-cost options, the workers said in the suit. Plan overseers also didn\u2019t properly negotiate for lower investment fees, according to court filings.\n\n\n\nThe plan accepted excessive fees charged by Vanguard to handle record-keeping duties, which caused beneficiaries to lose \u201cmillions of dollars in retirement savings,\u201d according to court filings.\n\n\n\nAnthem agreed in July to buy Cigna Corp. for $48 billion, one of two pending deals that would reshape the U.S. health-insurance industry. Anthem\u2019s offer, along with Aetna Inc.\u2019s proposed acquisition of Humana Inc., was fueled in part by the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Employees at Indianapolis-based health care insurer Anthem Inc. are sick of the retirement-fund fees they\u2019re paying.
