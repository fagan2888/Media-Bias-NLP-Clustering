The individual mandate that requires Americans to buy health insurance or face penalties under the Affordable Care Act is basically toothless, at least for this year, a new analysis shows.

The mandate, which is among the law’s most unpopular provisions, states that those without insurance must pay a penalty of $95 or 1 percent of their income, whichever is greater. But Time magazine reports that several caveats overlooked by many have weakened the law.

“The requirement to have health insurance under Obamacare packs less of a punch than many Americans assume,” Time reports.

The law is largely toothless in its first year for three reasons, Time says:

--The fine for failure to buy insurance is prorated to the time that a person is uninsured and is based on earnings above the federal income tax filing limit, which was $10,000 in 2013. The fines will go up next year, but this year they’re relatively small.

--There are lots of exemptions. There are loopholes that exempt Native Americans, prisoners, people with religious objections, those who are poor by several different measures, the homeless, people facing foreclosure, those who have had a utility shut off for non-payment, the bankrupt, victims of disaster, victims of domestic violence and others.

--There is little to no enforcement of the law’s mandates on individuals and families. The uninsured can’t be criminally prosecuted or incarcerated for refusal to pay fines and the IRS can’t place liens on property as a result of non-payment. The only method of enforcement of penalties is the withholding of the sum of the penalty from tax refunds. Those who don't receive refunds may escape the penalty entirely, TIME reports.

The first open enrollment period ended Monday night. The next opportunity to enroll begins when open enrollment resumes in November.
