On October 23, ArcelorMittal unilaterally shifted nonunion salaried employees to a Consumer-Driven Health Plan, with higher out-of-pocket costs. On November 13, US Steel warned that retirees should expect higher health care premiums next year.\n\nUnion contracts for 30,000 workers expired at both companies on September 1, but the United Steelworkers (USW) has ordered workers to continue working under the terms of a \u201ccontinue to work\u201d agreement. Both companies are demanding steep concessions on health care, pensions, contracting and scheduling.\n\nOn October 23, ArcelorMittal unilaterally announced plans to switch all nonunion salaried employees from a traditional employer-sponsored health plan to a more expensive Consumer-Driven Health Plan (CDHP). In a November 3 statement, ArcelorMittal CEO of Flat Carbon Andrew Harshaw attributed this decision to the slump in the steel industry, and primarily to the Obama administration\u2019s Affordable Care Act (ACA). He approvingly cites the ACA\u2019s aim of \u201cencouraging consumers to be more selective when choosing health care benefits to help drive down overall health care costs for the greater US population, and its tax on \u201cCadillac\u201d health plans with \u201ccomprehensive, low deductible plans which encourage overuse of the health care system.\u201d\n\nIn other words, ArcelorMittal is adhering to the Obama administration\u2019s goal of shifting health care costs onto the backs of workers, forcing them to forego necessary medical treatment and ultimately shortening lifespans.\n\nThe statement cites its proposed monthly premiums of $65 per month for an individual, and $198 per month for a family, claiming that these are low rates compared to other health plans. However, workers are required to pay 20 percent of in-network health care costs and must pay 100 percent of costs until an unspecified deductible is met, which could result in huge out-of-pocket costs.\n\nThe ArcelorMittal statement cites a study by human resources consulting firm Mercer noting that the percentage of employers with over 500 employees that offer CHDPs has increased from 39 percent in 2013 to 48 percent in 2014. For employers with over 20,000 employees, the number rose from 63 percent to 72 percent over the same period.\n\nThe USW responded to this announcement by claiming that the attacks on salaried workers are \u201cunnecessary\u201d and \u201cunfortunate,\u201d but \u201cwe recognize the non-represented salary employees have their compensation plans and we have ours,\u201d and \u201cat-will and non-represented employees have no recourse to resist or fight back.\u201d\n\nIn an October 30 post the USW bargaining committee for ArcelorMittal noted that the company\u2019s demands included \u201ctripling the share we currently contribute and significantly reducing our coverage and benefits.\u201d In a clear warning that the USW has no intention of seriously resisting the cuts demanded by ArcelorMittal, it at the same time assured management that it is committed \u201co negotiating a fair contract that allows ArcelorMittal to remain competitive.\u201d\n\nUS Steel has sent letters warning retirees to expect higher health care premiums in the coming year, says a post on the USW\u2019s web site dated November 13. The letter also announced a December 16 deadline for open enrollment for retiree benefits. This could pressure older workers into retirement if the contract negotiations are not concluded by that date.\n\nFor its part the USW merely called an increase in premiums a \u201cworst case scenario.\u201d\n\nSpecialty steelmaker Allegheny Technologies, Inc. (ATI) is demanding similar steep health concessions, which could amount to over $10,000 per family per year. ATI began locking out 2,200 workers in six states August 14. ATI has announced plans to terminate health coverage for ATI workers on November 30, forcing them to either pay $1,800 per month for COBRA insurance, or participate in the USW-sponsored \u201cmajor medical\u201d plan, which covers only emergency health care.\n\nThe slowdown of global steel demand, particularly in China, has driven down prices, placing pressure on steel industry profits. The World Steel Association forecasts a 1.7 percent decrease in demand in 2015. As of October 8, steel prices held at $170/ton, down 58 percent from a 2014 high of $400/ton. Chinese state-owned Sinosteel delayed an interest payment due on 2 billion yuan ($0.3 billion) of 5.3 percent notes last week.\n\nEverywhere, the steel industry is attempting to offload this burden on the backs of workers, with the unions as willing accomplices. In Australia, BlueScope Steel recently pushed through 500 job cuts at its Port Kembla works with the assistance of the Australian Workers Union, and may completely shut down its New Zealand operations. In the UK, steel companies are attempting to ax thousands of jobs.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.", "article_metadata": {"category": "heal-us", "ranking": 55, "description": "Steelmakers ArcelorMittal and US Steel each took steps over the past month to shift health care costs onto the backs of workers or retirees.", "language": "en", "author": "Evan Winters", "og": {"image": "http://www.wsws.org/img/open-graph-icon.png"}, "headline": "US steelmakers attack employee health care", "keywords": "United Steelworkers, ATI, Allegheny Technologies Incorporated, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, ArcelorMittal, USW, US Steel, lockout, Strom Engineering, scab, cobra", "date": "2015-11-28", "id": "a60388ff-e69f-4678-898e-d94b928982eB"}, "article_summary": "US steelmakers attack employee health careBy Evan Winters28 November 2015Steelmakers ArcelorMittal and US Steel each took steps over the past month to shift health care costs onto the backs of workers or retirees.\nOn November 13, US Steel warned that retirees should expect higher health care premiums next year.\nBoth companies are demanding steep concessions on health care, pensions, contracting and scheduling.\nHe approvingly cites the ACA\u2019s aim of \u201cencouraging consumers to be more selective when choosing health care benefits to help drive down overall health care costs for the greater US population, and its tax on \u201cCadillac\u201d health plans with \u201ccomprehensive, low deductible plans which encourage overuse of the health care system.\u201dIn other words, ArcelorMittal is adhering to the Obama administration\u2019s goal of shifting health care costs onto the backs of workers, forcing them to forego necessary medical treatment and ultimately shortening lifespans.\nHowever, workers are required to pay 20 percent of in-network health care costs and must pay 100 percent of costs until an unspecified deductible is met, which could result in huge out-of-pocket costs."}
