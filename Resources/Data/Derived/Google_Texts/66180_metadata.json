And I acknowledge that listening to them talk about this in what seems to be a very callous way is disturbing, but these are tissues and fetal organs where the women have given their permission, many of them get great comfort from thinking that this can go to help someone else, the drug companies do research with this. We get \u2014 that\u2019s how we get cures. And these were edited in a way to make it seem as though Planned Parenthood is selling this, and that is illegal. So, that\u2019s not happening. But it\u2019s a continuation of the abortion debate that we have in this country, and Planned Parenthood delivers very many health services to women around the country. And I think it\u2019s a tragedy that they are now, once again, going to be the center of attempts, mostly by the right, to try to defund them entirely.\u201d\n\nAfter Pat Buchanan objected that the way Planned Parenthood\u2019s employees talked sounded like something that belonged in Nazi Germany, Clift responded, \u201cThis is how medical professionals talk,\u201d and that while the tone in which Planned Parenthood\u2019s employees talked is \u201ccallous,\u201d \u201cif you heard any kind of surgery described graphically, you\u2019d be pretty repelled as well.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cI don\u2019t believe anybody has been proved to profit from this, and I would welcome the hearings on Capitol Hill. Let them have the hearings. They\u2019re going to find that Planned Parenthood did nothing illegal.\u201d And \u201cIf the Republicans turn this into a top-line issue going into the 2016 election, it will be a loser for them, because a majority of Americans support a woman\u2019s right to have an abortion in the early stages of her pregnancy.\u201d\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett", "article_metadata": {"description": "Eleanor Clift stated \"it's a tragedy\" that Planned Parenthood will \"be the center of attempts...to try to defund them entirely\"", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Eleanor Clift stated \"it's a tragedy\" that Planned Parenthood will \"be the center of attempts...to try to defund them entirely\"", "title": "Clift: 'Tragedy' That People Are Trying to Defund Planned Parenthood - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 475, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/07/Clift-725-Thumbnail.jpg", "height": 356}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/07/25/clift-tragedy-that-people-are-trying-to-defund-planned-parenthood/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Eleanor Clift stated \"it's a tragedy\" that Planned Parenthood will \"be the center of attempts...to try to defund them entirely\"", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/07/Clift-725-Thumbnail.jpg", "title": "Clift: 'Tragedy' That People Are Trying to Defund Planned Parenthood - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Eleanor Clift, Planned Parenthood,Abortion, Breitbart TV,Planned Parenthood", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Abortion", "tag": "Planned Parenthood", "published_time": "2015-07-25T13:10:59-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV,Abortion"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERDaily Beast correspondent Eleanor Clift stated \u201cit\u2019s a tragedy\u201d that Planned Parenthood will \u201cbe the center of attempts, mostly by the right, to try to defund them entirely\u201d on Friday\u2019s \u201cMcLaughlin Group.\u201dSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERClift maintained that the money Planned Parenthood receives is \u201cfor storage and shipping.\nAnd these were edited in a way to make it seem as though Planned Parenthood is selling this, and that is illegal.\nBut it\u2019s a continuation of the abortion debate that we have in this country, and Planned Parenthood delivers very many health services to women around the country.\nWe get \u2014 that\u2019s how we get cures.\nSo, that\u2019s not happening."}
