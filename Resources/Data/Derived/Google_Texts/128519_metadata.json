The transcript was provided by the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Public Affairs.\n\nThank you, President [David] Wilson, for those kind words \u2013 and thank you all for such a warm welcome. It\u2019s a pleasure to join you on this beautiful campus. And it\u2019s a privilege to stand with so many distinguished faculty, staff, and administrators; members of the Board of Regents; and proud parents, family members, friends, and alumni \u2013 in congratulating the Morgan State University Class of 2014.\n\nI\u2019d like to thank Calvin Butler for his thoughtful remarks. And I want to thank Chairman \u2013 and former Congressman and NAACP President \u2013 Kweisi Mfume for his inspiring words and his service to our nation over the course of his exemplary career. I\u2019d also like to recognize every member of Morgan State\u2019s renowned choir and band for sharing their talents with us. Thank you for making today\u2019s ceremony so special. And thank you, most of all, to the Class of 2014 for inviting me to share in this moment \u2013 as we mark the end of one chapter of your lives and celebrate the beginning of the next.\n\nI know each of you walked a difficult path to be here today \u2013 a path beset by challenges; some prescribed by your professors to test your knowledge and skills, others by outside circumstances \u2013 and some by societal factors beyond your control. Every obstacle \u2013 every paper and project; every midterm and final exam \u2013 had to be confronted and overcome before you could take your seat among this crowd. And while we applaud your individual achievements today, celebrate your collective victories, and commemorate what is truly a significant milestone \u2013 the fact is that, for all the work, the studying, and the sleepless nights \u2013 none of you made this journey alone.\n\nIn so many ways, the path that led you to this moment was forged by men and women who came before you \u2013 many seemingly ordinary, but all extraordinary \u2013 from those who pioneered the establishment of this great school more than 140 years ago, to those who first opened its doors to women and, later, to students of all races and backgrounds. Each of their journeys was less certain. They had no set courses to guide them. And they must have found, at times, that there was no obvious way forward \u2013 and nothing but darkness and difficulty stretching out ahead \u2013 their path lit only by the flame of America\u2019s founding promise.\n\nThey were courageous individuals \u2013 from Reverend Joseph Albert DeLaine, to Sarah Bolling, to Oliver Brown \u2013 who stood up and spoke out, often at great personal cost, for what they knew to be right. They were civil rights advocates and attorneys \u2013 like Robert Carter, Jack Greenberg, and Baltimore\u2019s own Thurgood Marshall \u2013 who translated a growing, restless movement into a focused fight for legal change. And they were eminent jurists like Chief Justice Earl Warren and his eight colleagues on the United States Supreme Court \u2013 who, exactly sixty years ago today, unanimously declared, in Brown v. Board of Education, that separate was inherently unequal \u2013 and that racial segregation ran contrary to the Constitution\u2019s guarantee of equal protection under law.\n\nAt the time of this revolutionary ruling, I was just three years old and still a few years away from starting school. My generation was the first to come of age in a post-Brown America. And although the vestiges of state-sanctioned discrimination affected many aspects of our lives \u2013 and continue to reverberate across the country even today \u2013 thanks to Brown and those who made it possible, your generation will never know a world in which \u201cseparate but equal\u201d was the law of the land.\n\nOf course, if that era seems like ancient history to you, that\u2019s only because your forebears \u2013 including members of the Class of 1964 who are with us today \u2013 came together to make it ancient history. In the wake of Brown v. Board, people of all ages \u2013 and from every corner of our nation \u2013 were inspired and emboldened by the courage, the conviction, and the persistence of those who risked so much in the fight for freedom and justice. Today, as you walk across this stage, each of you will take your rightful place as heirs of these pioneers \u2013 from the Freedom Riders who defied prejudice to travel through the segregated South, to the marchers in Selma and Birmingham who risked their lives for a dream they knew they might not live to see; from the hundreds of students right here at Morgan who helped initiate the national sit-in movement, to a young man named Robert Bell, who would go on to graduate from Morgan State, and who \u2013 in 1960, at just 16 years old \u2013 was arrested for participating in a sit-in at a Baltimore restaurant that served only white customers.\n\nFollowing his arrest, Robert Bell became the lead appellant in a landmark civil rights case known as Bell v. Maryland, which ultimately pushed this state \u2013 and the entire country \u2013 closer to desegregation. He and his fellow students were represented by legendary lawyers like Thurgood Marshall and Constance Baker Motley. And after that victory \u2013 and his graduation from \u201cFair Morgan\u201d \u2013 Robert went on to attend Harvard Law School. And he eventually became the first African-American Chief Judge to serve on the highest court in Maryland, retiring just last year.\n\nChief Judge Bell\u2019s journey started right here in Baltimore, when he was not much younger than many of you. Despite their age, he and his classmates rose to the greatest moral challenge of their time. They devoted themselves to the cause of justice in the face of adversity that \u2013 to us \u2013 would be unthinkable. And in so doing, they not only overcame obstacles \u2013 they transcended history. They helped to pull this nation closer to its founding ideals. And many of them once sat where you do today.\n\nTo the Class of 2014, Chief Judge Bell\u2019s achievements \u2013 and his extraordinary life story \u2013 should be more than just an inspiration. They stand as a challenge to every young woman and young man who walks in his footsteps. They should drive you to question that which is accepted truth. Dare to reach beyond yourselves. Aim, as he did, not merely to witness history, but to make it. And strive to live up to the singular legacy that belongs to each Morgan graduate by virtue of the history you now inherit, the milestone anniversary we observe today, and the profound sacrifices endured by the trailblazers on whose shoulders you now stand.\n\nWhen I think of these sacrifices, I think of \u2013 and thank \u2013 both of my parents, whom I love, admire \u2013 and who I miss each and every day. I think in particular of my father \u2013 who immigrated to this country as a young boy many years ago from Barbados; who enlisted in the military during World War Two when he was close to 40 years old; and who proudly wore the uniform of the United States Army during his service in that war. When I reflect on the power of individual determination, I think of the same great man \u2013 who was denied service at a lunch counter and told to leave a whites-only train car even though he was wearing the uniform of his country \u2013 a uniform of which he was proud, and which he treasured, throughout his life. And when I think of the duties, the rights, and the weighty responsibilities of American citizenship \u2013 responsibilities that are now entrusted to each of you \u2013 I think of that man, my father \u2013 for whom I am named, who never lost faith in the greatness of his country even when it did not reciprocate his devotion. A man who never stopped believing in the promise of this nation, even when that promise was obscured by injustice. And a man whose dedication to preserving the American Dream ran so deep that he put his life on the line to defend that dream the moment it was threatened; who worked hard, along with my mother, to give my brother and me every opportunity to succeed; and who taught us, by word and by deed, that this country\u2019s true greatness lives in its highest aspirations \u2013 and in the power of every citizen to chart our nation\u2019s course, and build a brighter future, together.\n\nToday, as we celebrate an inflection point in American history and mark the commencement of over 850 new leaders \u2013 each of you blessed by a sense of opportunity and possibility that would have been unimaginable just a few short generations ago \u2013 I urge you to be mindful of this history we share. I implore you to remember \u2013 as you work to \u201cgrow the future and lead the world\u201d \u2013 that you are part of something, and heirs to a legacy, much larger than yourselves. You owe a tremendous debt to all who came before \u2013 your grandparents, your parents and mine \u2013 to those who built this nation while it held them in chains; to those who served their country even when its businesses and schools refused to serve them; to those who marched for the ideals we\u2019ve always held sacred; to those who carried this fight from our city streets all the way to the highest court in the land.\n\nAs you move forward from this moment, you must resolve to be both serious about your life choices and respectful of your proud, singular past. Wherever you go and whatever you do, you must find your own unique ways to contribute; to blaze a path for the next generation of Morgan graduates; and to keep challenging this nation to become even greater, even fairer, and even more committed to its founding ideals.\n\nAfter all, there can be no question \u2013 as I look over this crowd \u2013 that our country has come a long way on the road to equality and opportunity. But there\u2019s also no denying that this struggle is far from over. Critical work remains unfinished. And the expansion of this progress constitutes a sacred charge that tomorrow\u2019s leaders must strive to fulfill. That you must fulfill.\n\nOver the last few weeks and months, we\u2019ve seen occasional, jarring reminders of the discrimination \u2013 and the isolated, repugnant, racist views \u2013 that in some places have yet to be overcome. These incidents have received substantial media coverage. And they have rightly been condemned by leaders, commentators, and citizens from all backgrounds and walks of life.\n\nBut we ought not find contentment in the fact that these high-profile expressions of outright bigotry seem atypical and were met with such swift condemnation. Because if we focus solely on these incidents \u2013 on outlandish statements that capture national attention and spark outrage on Facebook and Twitter \u2013 we are likely to miss the more hidden, and more troubling, reality behind the headlines.\n\nThese outbursts of bigotry, while deplorable, are not the true markers of the struggle that still must be waged, or the work that still needs to be done \u2013 because the greatest threats do not announce themselves in screaming headlines. They are more subtle. They cut deeper. And their terrible impact endures long after the headlines have faded and obvious, ignorant expressions of hatred have been marginalized.\n\nNor does the greatest threat to equal opportunity any longer reside in overtly discriminatory statutes like the \u201cseparate but equal\u201d laws of 60 years ago. Since the era of Brown, laws making classifications based on race have been subjected to a legal standard known as \u201cstrict scrutiny.\u201d Almost invariably, these statutes, when tested, fail to pass constitutional muster. But there are other policies that too easily escape such scrutiny because they have the appearance of being race-neutral. Their impacts, however, are anything but. This is the concern we must contend with today: policies that impede equal opportunity in fact, if not in form.\n\nCodified segregation of public schools has been barred since Brown. But in too many of our school districts, significant divisions persist and segregation has reoccurred \u2013 including zero-tolerance school discipline practices that, while well-intentioned and aimed at promoting school safety, affect black males at a rate three times higher than their white peers.\n\nThere are other examples.\n\nFor instance, in our criminal justice system, systemic and unwarranted racial disparities remain disturbingly common. One study released last year by the U.S. Sentencing Commission indicated that \u2013 in recent years \u2013 African-American men have received sentences that are nearly 20 percent longer than those imposed on white males convicted of similar crimes. Another report showed that American Indians are often sentenced even more harshly. The Justice Department is examining these and other disparities as we speak \u2013 and taking a variety of steps to ensure fair sentences that match the conduct at issue in individual cases. Like a growing chorus of lawmakers across the political spectrum, we recognize that disparate outcomes are not only shameful and unacceptable \u2013 they impede our ability to see that justice is done. And they perpetuate cycles of poverty, crime, and incarceration that trap individuals, destroy communities, and decimate minority neighborhoods.\n\nAnd until the passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, African Americans\u2019 right to the franchise was aggressively restricted based solely on race. Today, such overt measures cannot survive. Yet in too many jurisdictions, new types of restrictions are justified as attempts to curb an epidemic of voter fraud that \u2013 in reality \u2013 has never been shown to exist. Rather than addressing a supposedly widespread problem, these policies disproportionately disenfranchise African Americans, Hispanics, other communities of color, and vulnerable populations such as the elderly. But interfering with or depriving a person of the right to vote should never be a political aim. It is a moral failing. In recent years, thousands of Americans, the pride of our nation, have given their lives \u2013 and deal even today with the scars of war \u2013 so that hopeful, striving people who live continents away could proudly hold up their purple fingers after voting in a truly democratic process. America is now 50 years from Freedom Summer. And we must not countenance, within our own borders, practices that would make it difficult or impossible to exercise the right for which so many have given so much.\n\nOur country is stronger when all Americans are treated equally. Yet we know that boys and young men of color have historically and consistently faced some of the most severe challenges to success. Through the President\u2019s My Brother\u2019s Keeper initiative, agencies across the federal government are identifying ways to help. This initiative is a call to action that includes foundations, corporations, community leaders, and you \u2013 because we must all work together to broaden horizons for younger generations, just as our predecessors did.\n\nThis is the work that truly matters \u2013 because policies that disenfranchise specific groups are more pernicious than hateful rants. Proposals that feed uncertainty, question the desire of a people to work, and relegate particular Americans to economic despair are more malignant than intolerant public statements, no matter how many eyebrows the outbursts might raise. And a criminal justice system that treats groups of people differently \u2013 and punishes them unequally \u2013 has a much more negative impact than misguided words that we can reject out of hand.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts has argued that the path to ending racial discrimination is to give less consideration to the issue of race altogether. This presupposes that racial discrimination is at a sufficiently low ebb that it doesn\u2019t need to be actively confronted. In its most obvious forms, it might be. But discrimination does not always come in the form of a hateful epithet or a Jim Crow-like statute. And so we must continue to take account of racial inequality, especially in its less obvious forms, and actively discuss ways to combat it. As Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote recently in an insightful dissent in the Michigan college admissions case \u2013 we must not \u201cwish away, rather than confront, the racial inequality that exists in our society. \u2026 The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to speak openly and candidly on the subject of race.\u201d\n\nOf course, talking forthrightly about these difficult issues \u2013 and building a constructive and inclusive national dialogue \u2013 will not by itself be sufficient to address them. But it\u2019s a necessary first step that must lead to action. Our most serious and systemic challenges are too often dismissed, or oversimplified, or blamed on politics. But we do ourselves and our great nation a grave disservice whenever we reach for easy answers or revert to stale talking points; whenever we fall victim to old paradigms and traditional habits of thought; and whenever we trade the noisy discord of honest, tough, and vigorous debate for the quiet prejudice of inaction \u2013 and the cold silence of consent.\n\nIndeed \u2013 if our history is any guide \u2013 fostering a positive national dialogue is the best possible way to keep building on the achievements of our past as we look to the future. From Brown to the Civil Rights Act of 1964; from the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to sweeping reforms like Head Start, Medicare, Medicaid, and the Affordable Care Act \u2013 which is already helping millions of young people like you get quality, affordable health insurance \u2013 the last half-century has witnessed extraordinary steps forward. And each of these achievements was made possible by driven, determined individuals, many of whom were no more and no less qualified than each of you.\n\nProgress can be achingly slow \u2013 but in this country, as a courtroom full of men and women was reminded six decades ago, our destiny is of our own design. Your futures, and your children\u2019s futures, will be shaped by what you do today, tomorrow, and every day after that. And history will be written by the graduates before me \u2013 by the stands you take and the challenges you accept.\n\nAfter all, 60 years and one day ago, schools and other public accommodations could legally refuse entry to men like my father. Today, that devoted soldier\u2019s son stands before you as the 82nd Attorney General of the United States of America \u2013 proudly serving in the Administration of the first African-American president to lead this nation. That\u2019s a powerful illustration of the greatness and possibility that is America \u2013 and the debt we owe to all who have dedicated their lives to building the more just and more perfect Union that remains our common pursuit.\n\nAs graduates of Morgan State University, you\u2019ve been given a rare chance to follow in the footsteps of giants \u2013 no matter what degree you\u2019ve attained, or what direction your life and career will take when you leave this campus. So as you fan out across Maryland and all around the country, I urge you to find ways to serve your communities and give back to our nation. Never hesitate to ask difficult questions and call attention to uncomfortable truths. And work, above all, to promote understanding, to foster inclusion, and to push our nation forward.\n\nClass of 2014: I look forward to all that you will do, and achieve, from this moment on. Know that your opportunities are constrained only by the power of your imaginations and the strength of your collective will. And always remember that \u2013 so long as you stay true to the principles that define us and the history that\u2019s now yours to shape \u2013 your potential is truly without limit. Our proud past stretches behind you. And a boundless future awaits \u2013 a future we can and must build together.\n\nCongratulations, once again, on this considerable achievement \u2013 and good luck to you all.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "eric holder, eric holder commencement speech transcript, eric holder commencement remarks transcript, eric holder morgan state speech, eric holder morgan state race", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Eric Holder addresses graduates at Morgan State University in Baltimore.", "title": "Transcript: Attorney general Eric Holder\u2019s speech to Morgan State University graduates", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/transcript-attorney-general-eric-holders-speech-to-morgan-state-university-graduates/2014/05/17/d6b72284-ddd0-11e3-b745-87d39690c5c0_story.html", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=https://img.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-3000x1568.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/transcript-attorney-general-eric-holders-speech-to-morgan-state-university-graduates/2014/05/17/d6b72284-ddd0-11e3-b745-87d39690c5c0_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "eric holder, eric holder commencement speech transcript, eric holder commencement remarks transcript, eric holder morgan state speech, eric holder morgan state race", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "eomportal-uuid": "d6b72284-ddd0-11e3-b745-87d39690c5c0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "description": "Eric Holder addresses graduates at Morgan State University in Baltimore."}, "article_summary": "The following is the text of remarks as prepared for delivery by Attorney General Eric Holder at the Morgan State University commencement ceremony in Baltimore on Saturday, May 17, 2014.\nI\u2019d also like to recognize every member of Morgan State\u2019s renowned choir and band for sharing their talents with us.\nThey stand as a challenge to every young woman and young man who walks in his footsteps.\nAnd after that victory \u2013 and his graduation from \u201cFair Morgan\u201d \u2013 Robert went on to attend Harvard Law School.\nAnd history will be written by the graduates before me \u2013 by the stands you take and the challenges you accept."}
