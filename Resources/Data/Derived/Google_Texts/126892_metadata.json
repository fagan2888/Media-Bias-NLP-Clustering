We continue to add talent strategically across the Dorsey platform to better serve our clients around the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am delighted to be returning to Dorsey and its great Firm-wide team of employee benefits lawyers,\u201d noted Mr. Seng. \u201cThrough appropriate staffing and fee arrangements, large firms like Dorsey have a unique and critical opportunity to serve the needs of business in an area that is key to the employment relationship and struggling under many layers of regulation.
