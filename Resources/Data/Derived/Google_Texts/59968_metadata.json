He said he has since learned that Australian law requires someone to report a crime that could be punishable by five years in jail. \u201cI would\u2019ve gone to the police,\u201d he said, if he had known about the reporting requirements.\n\nThe victim, who was 7 years old at the time of the abuse, has claimed that the younger Houston accused him of \u201ctempting\u201d his father.\n\nHouston flatly denied the charge.\n\nSorry, Christian Post, but that reads like fair, solid reporting to me.\n\nAnd as RNS explains later in the piece, there's a reason these questions are being raised now:\n\nHillsong is part of a larger Australian government investigation, called a royal commission, that is probing how institutions handle abuse claims. The high-level probe is expected to last another four years.\n\nMeanwhile, The New York Times focused on a different angle \u2014 one that, if accurate, certainly seems newsworthy:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Leaders of the Australia-based Hillsong Church \u2014\u00a0described by Religion News \r\nService\u00a0as \"one of the most influential religious brands across the globe\" \r\nand\u00a0by\u00a0The New York Times\u00a0as \"one of the more influential global \r\nmegachurches\" \u2014 held a news conference in New York last week.\r\n\r\nThe Christian Post\u00a0apparently didn't like\u00a0the questions asked by mainstream \r\nreporters.\r\n\r\n    NEW YORK\u00a0\u2014 Brian Houston, senior pastor of Australia-based Hillsong\r\n    Church, was hit with a series of critical questions during a press\r\n    conference in New York City on Thursday, just hours before he was to\r\n    take the stage at Madison Square Garden to preach before more than\r\n    5,000 Hillsong Conference attendees.\r\n\r\n    Houston, 60, appeared visibly nervous as he sat alongside his wife and\r\n    Hillsong Church co-pastor Bobbie Houston and his son and Hillsong\r\n    United frontman Joel Houston, who also pastors at Hillsong NYC with\r\n    Carl Lentz.
