That significantly smaller, $7 billion deal went largely unopposed.\n\nThe same can\u2019t be said of the Anthem-Cigna acquisition, which would create a company with $115 billion in annual revenues and insure 53 million members. Critics argue the merger would reduce competition, increase rates and make it harder for patients to find doctors.\n\n\u201cAnthem, which is already a behemoth, would leapfrog Kaiser in California and United nationwide to be the biggest insurance company in California and the country,\u201d said Carmen Balber, executive director of the Consumer Watchdog advocacy group. Her organization didn\u2019t oppose the HealthNet-Centene merger but wants state regulators to reject the deal between Connecticut\u2019s Cigna and Anthem, an Indianapolis company that operates as Anthem Blue Cross in California.\n\nThe health insurance industry is undergoing a surge of consolidation, including the planned merger of Aetna and Humana, which the California Department of Insurance plans to review in hearings next month.\n\nWhile the federal Affordable Care Act has helped reduce the number of uninsured Americans, some observers say it\u2019s also spurred merger activity.\n\n\u201cThe health insurance marketplace is doing extraordinarily well after the passage of the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Balber said. \u201cThey have guaranteed markets and profits are incredibly strong, which has put them in position \u2026 to gobble up all the smaller companies in the market.\u201d\n\nIf the merger is approved, Anthem would grow from 39 million members nationwide to more than 53 million, surpassing the nearly 46 million members of UnitedHealth Group. In California, Anthem-Cigna\u2019s enrollment of 8.2 million would top Kaiser\u2019s more than 7 million members.\n\nAnthem, for its part, described expanding access to affordable health coverage as the company\u2019s top priority and \u201cthe foundation of our combination with Cigna.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnthem and Cigna have limited overlap in a highly competitive industry and together will be in a better position to improve consumer choice and quality,\u201d said Darrel Ng, spokesman for Anthem Blue Cross. \u201cAdditionally, we will be better able to manage the cost drivers that negatively impact affordability for consumers.\u201d\n\nOfficials from the state Department of Insurance declined to discuss the Anthem-Cigna merger in advance of the hearing. But they did say the proposal is different from the HealthNet-Centene deal, which they contend could actually strengthen competition within California.\n\nJanice Rocco, the insurance department\u2019s deputy commissioner, noted that the marketplaces of HealthNet, which is from Woodland Hills (Los Angeles County), and Centene don\u2019t overlap.\n\n\u201cWith the HealthNet-Centene merger, capital is invested into HealthNet that might make them a stronger competitor with Kaiser, Anthem, Blue Cross and Blue Shield,\u201d Rocco said.\n\nVictoria Colliver is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.
