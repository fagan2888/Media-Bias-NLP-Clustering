(Gary Coronado/Pool via Bloomberg)\n\nWell, here we are, at the last Republican debate before the next eight hundred debates \u2014 and the actual last debate before Super Tuesday. Jeb! is gone. (\u201cHis best performance ever!\u201d Twitter proclaimed, because we human beings are cruel.) But perhaps the only winning move on Thursday night was not to play.\n\nHere, for anyone who lacked the stamina for another debate, is a rough summary of what happened. As is usual in these, the end times, candidates\u2019 actual words are in italics.\n\nWolf Blitzer: Hello and welcome to the GOP debate. I will be moderating this debate. Kind of. Opening statements?\n\nBen Carson: If someone had tried to describe today\u2019s America to you thirty years ago, you would have listened in disbelief. Robot cats! Trees made from human skin! And Donald Trump\u2019s the president! What a time to be alive!\n\nJohn Kasich: My father carried mail on his back. His father was a coal miner. They would have been amazed to see me up here on this stage tonight, not because it would never have occurred to them that their son and grandson could run for president but because they thought that with my poll numbers, surely I would have dropped out by now.\n\nMarco Rubio: AMERICA! COME WITH ME IF YOU WANT TO LIVE!\n\nTed Cruz: Wait, you\u2019re here to stop Donald Trump? I thought I was here to stop Donald Trump.\n\nTrump: I am just here to have a good time. (pulls out an old flintlock musket, fires it, and kills an endangered puppy. The crowd cheers) I am having a blast! Nothing I say or do matters, and no one can do anything to me. I am no longer just Jeb Bush\u2019s nightmare! I am the nightmare of everyone on this stage!\n\nWolf: Talk about immigration!\n\nRubio: Donald, you criticized Mitt Romney for using the term \u201cself-deportation.\u201d\n\nTrump: I criticized Mitt Romney for lots of reasons. Pssh, look at the guy.\n\nRubio: Also, try the search term \u201cTrump polish workers.\u201d (points) See, Ben Carson\u2019s Googling it!\n\nCarson: I\u2019m playing Candy Crush, actually.\n\nRubio: Kasich?\n\nKasich: Huh, when you type in \u201cTrump polish workers\u201d it suggests \u201cvote Marco Rubio\u201d and \u201csix different ways you can tell Rubio is not a robot\u201d and \u201cOkay, Rubio is a robot, but he\u2019s from the future and he is YOUR ONLY CHANCE, AMERICA.\u201d\n\nRubio: PLEASE. LET ME SAVE YOU. I am only sweating because I HAVE SEEN WHAT THE STAKES ARE.\n\nTrump: Hush now, Marco. (Audience applauds.) Everyone, watch me strangle this rare bird with my hands, which are a NORMAL SIZE. (Trump does so. Wild cheering.) Look, what you said was very nice and very interesting, probably, but I was not listening. I\u2019ve hired people. Have you ever hired people?\n\nRubio: Maybe not, but in the timeline where I came from President Rubio hires lots of people and ushers in a golden age.\n\nCruz: I\u2019m just sad that people think that nobody knew about illegal immigration before Donald Trump. I was into the issue of illegal immigration BEFORE it was cool.\n\nTrump: Shut up, Ted. No one likes you. Not a single person. Raise your hand if you like Ted. (pause) Nobody? Now make a noise if you think Ted is a nightmare of a human being. (Crowd laughs, applauds.) Now pelt him with raw vegetables!\n\nCruz: YOU THINK THAT BOTHERS ME? I BATHE IN YOUR HATRED! I\u2019VE BEEN LOATHED BY PEOPLE SINCE BEFORE YOU WERE A TWINKLE IN YOUR DADDY\u2019S LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT!\n\nRubio: (earnestly, to Cruz, in an undertone) What timeline are you from? What are you trying to accomplish here?\n\nBlitzer: Donald, the president of Mexico said he wouldn\u2019t pay for your, quote, \u201ceffing wall.\u201d\n\nTrump: The wall just got TEN FEET higher and a BILLION dollars more expensive! The wall has moved from the realm of fantasy, past several Bernie Sanders budget proposals, and across the border into Gumdrop Land, a beautiful place where I am building a very tasteful casino.\n\nRubio: If you build the wall, you will be using illegal immigrant labor to do it. Google this, everyone! Also, Google \u201cTrump University!\u201d\n\nCarson: I just googled it and it sounds like a wonderful deal! How do I sign up?\n\n(Rubio slams his head repeatedly into the podium. A red light starts to flash behind his ear. He slams his head again and it turns off.)\n\nRubio: If Trump had not inherited all that money, he would be selling watches!\n\nTrump: What\u2019s wrong with selling watches? I have a whole armful of huge, classy watches. I\u2019ll sell you one now, if you like.\n\nCruz: Marco, why are you so wrong on ethanol?\n\nRubio: Ted, what are you doing? You\u2019re supposed to be attacking him, not me!\n\nMar\u00eda Celeste Arrar\u00e1s: Yes, what he said.\n\nHugh Hewitt: Talk about Supreme Court nominees.\n\nTrump: I will not nominate bad, disappointing people like Ted Cruz\u2019s John Roberts.\n\nCruz: For the last time, I had no choice! I would not have nominated him! I was just doing what George W. Bush wanted!\n\nCarson: Hey, wait, speaking of George W., Jeb\u2019s not here! Where\u2019d he go? Did we start without him by mistake?\n\nHewitt: How about you, Dr. Carson? Who would you nominate?\n\nCarson: \u201cAs president, I would go through and I would look at what a person\u2019s life has been. What have they done in the past? What kind of judgments have they made? What kind of associations do they have? That will tell you a lot more than an interview will tell you. The fruit salad of their life is what I will look at.\u201d\n\nHewitt: I\u2019m sorry, what?\n\nCarson: Justice Ginsburg, the fruit salad of her life is full of those large irregular pear slices that can really overwhelm the rest of the contents of the salad. You can\u2019t have that. Whereas Justice Alito has a good ratio of pineapple, melon \u2014 and you know that\u2019s real juice he\u2019s got in there, not syrup. That\u2019s important. Now Kagan, that is more difficult, but I think there is an assortment of raspberries, maybe a lingonberry. I would have to do some research.\n\nHewitt: I wish you got to talk more.\n\nRubio: I don\u2019t.\n\nDana Bash: Donald, do you know what you would replace Obamacare with?\n\nTrump: No.\n\nBash: Do you understand how health insurance works?\n\nTrump: I would get rid of the lines around the states.\n\nBash: Can you describe what an exchange is or how you would run it or say any sentence about healthcare or insurance that is not immediately, obviously incorrect?\n\nTrump: Look, I read an article, I think, about this, where it said that they had some very interesting, some things, that if they got rid of something, things would be a lot less, you know. Very interesting stuff. And I will do that thing.\n\n(Applause)\n\nBash: Really, audience? Really?\n\nTrump: A lot of my best friends are insurance companies.\n\nRubio: You actually don\u2019t know how Obamacare works, do you? Say something that isn\u2019t \u201cI\u2019ll get rid of the lines.\u201d\n\nTrump: I\u2019ll get RID of the LINES.\n\nRubio: How are you visualizing this in your mind? Do you think this is, like, a big map where you just erase something?\n\nTrump: (aggressively, but you can tell he\u2019s trying to find out the real answer, like a kid on the playground responding to a surprising taunt about human anatomy): Is it not?\n\nRubio: But then what?\n\nTrump: Well, we\u2019ll erase those lines. We\u2019ll erase them, and they\u2019ll be gone. Poof!\n\nRubio: And then \u2014\n\nTrump: Well, without the lines, there\u2019ll be competition. There won\u2019t be lines.\n\nRubio: Stop repeating yourself.\n\nTrump: Stop repeating YOURSELF.\n\nRubio: You have literally five things that you say. \u201cEveryone\u2019s dumb, he\u2019s gonna make America great again\u2026 We\u2019re going to win, win win, he\u2019s winning in the polls\u2026 And the lines around the state. Every night.\u201d\n\nTrump: That is not true. I also say, \u201cHuge\u201d and \u201cGreat.\u201d\n\nBash: Donald, do you want to talk about your plan?\n\nTrump: No.\n\nBash: John Kasich, would you care to drain the air from the room?\n\nKasich: I\u2019m not doing it on purpose, Dana.\n\nBash: Ben Carson, how about you?\n\nBen Carson: I have given this a lot of thought and I think: cherries, mangoes, grapes, and grapefruit. Those little chunks of grapefruit that you\u2019re never expecting. That\u2019s Justice Thomas, to me.\n\nCruz: I am sharply to the right of Donald on Obamacare. I\u2019d like to be clear about that. He says things like \u201cI don\u2019t think people with pre-existing conditions should die in the street\u201d \u2014 well, I don\u2019t agree. We are different, he and I. I am not weak like him.\n\nTrump: Just so we\u2019re clear, you are going on the record as in favor of people dying in the streets, Ebenezer Cruz.\n\nRubio: Ted, please, I already did a more appealing version of this attack. Stop helping.\n\nBlitzer: Governor Kasich, would Donald\u2019s plan work?\n\nKasich: Well, it wouldn\u2019t work in Ohio! (crickets) Come on, that always goes over HUGE in Cleveland!\n\nBlitzer: Mitt Romney says there\u2019s a bombshell in your taxes, Donald.\n\nTrump: Hang on one second, let me push an old lady off the stage to almost certain death! (He does so. His poll numbers go up) You were saying?\n\nBlitzer: Why haven\u2019t you released your returns?\n\nTrump: Because I\u2019m being audited.\n\nCruz: Wait, that\u2019s your actual answer, you can\u2019t release your returns because you\u2019re being audited?\n\nTrump: Yuuuuup.\n\nRubio: I have to agree with Ted here. What?\n\nTrump: Let me just say in response to Ted that I am winning in the polls. I will make America great again. We\u2019re going to win, win win.\n\nCruz: You\u2019re not beating Hillary.\n\nTrump: \u201cWell, then, if I can\u2019t \u2014 if \u2014 hey, if I can\u2019t beat her, you\u2019re really going to get killed, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nAudience: OOOOOOOOOOOH\n\nTrump: Ted, if you were a sandwich, you would be a single slice of ham by itself, because you could not get two slices of bread to stand beside you. Nobody likes you, Ted.\n\nCruz: I DRINK YOUR HATRED. IT MAKES ME STRONGER.\n\nTrump: Does it, though?\n\nBlitzer: How much does everyone on this stage love Israel?\n\nRubio: So much.\n\nCruz: I have endorsed Israel for President of the United States.\n\nTrump: Look, real estate is real estate. Deals are deals. Israel is just some fancy real estate in a great location. Peace in the Middle East is just another deal, and I am in favor of peace in the Middle East. Many Miss Universe contestants have said that in my hearing and I think they made some good, complex points.\n\nBlitzer: Governor Kasich, what would you do about Kim Jong Un? Remove him?\n\nKasich: Well, that would depend on what was happening. If things were happening where it seemed like the right move was to remove him, I\u2019d remove him. If not, then, no, I don\u2019t think so. Shucks.\n\nTrump: Also, is there a way to put Gadhafi back in charge in Libya? I liked him. Seemed like a guy who knew what he was doing. Unlike this crowd of losers. \u201cI mean, first of all, this guy is a choke artist, and this guy is a liar.\u201d\n\nCarson: Can somebody attack me, please?\n\nTrump: No.\n\nCruz: (clears throat) Actually, \u201cfalsely accusing someone of lying is itself a lie\u2026\u201d\n\nTrump: Don\u2019t try to confuse us with your liar talk, liar. \u201cI know politicians \u2014 I know politicians, believe it or not, better than you do. And it\u2019s not good.\u201d\n\nCruz: I believe it. No, no. I believe you know politicians much better than I do, because for 40 years, you\u2019ve been funding liberal Democratic politicians. And by the way\u2026\u201d\n\nTrump: I funded you. I funded him. Can you believe it?\n\nRubio: He never funded ME.\n\nCruz: And \u2014 and by the way, let\u2019s be clear. Donald claims \u2014 Donald claims to care about\u2026\n\nTrump: You know why? I didn\u2019t want to, but he sent me his book with his autograph\u2026\n\nCruz: Donald. Donald. Donald. I understand rules are very hard for you. They\u2019re very confusing.\n\nTrump: Mr. Trump, you\u2019re doing a great job. I have his book. Thank you \u2014 thank you for the book. Go ahead.\n\nCruz: Donald, you can get back on your meds now.\n\nTrump: This is a lot of fun up here tonight, I have to tell you. Thank \u2014 thank you for the book. I really appreciate.\n\nCruz: Donald \u2014 Donald, relax.\n\nTrump: Go ahead. I\u2019m relaxed. You\u2019re the basket case. Go ahead. Don\u2019t get nervous. Go ahead.\n\nCruz: I promise you, Donald, there\u2019s nothing about you\u2026\n\nTrump: I\u2019ve seen you.\n\nCruz: \u2026 that makes anyone nervous. [Politifact rating: mostly false.]\n\nTrump: You\u2019re losing so badly you \u2014 I want to\u2026\n\nCruz: You know, people are actually watching this at home.\n\nRubio: Is there a guy who is supposed to be moderating this?\n\nBlitzer: Hey now, guys.\n\nRubio: Wow, that\u2019s some moderation.\n\nBlitzer: Hey now, guys. Hey. Can we \u2014 can we not? In all honesty, I\u2019m worried that if this debate goes any longer, I will be trampled underfoot. You want closing statements? Or not? Not is fine too, it\u2019s about what you want tonight.\n\nCarson: Closing statements are fine. Look at my hands. \u201cA movie was made about these hands.\u201d They are the right size to make a movie about, unlike some of the hands on these stage. Look at the fruit salad of my life, then make your decision. Peaches.\n\nKasich: I\u2019ve been trying to stand apart from the fray tonight, or at least off to the side of the fray, hoping that no one will notice I am there and throw a dodgeball at me. It has worked and backfired simultaneously. Vote for me in Ohio, please!\n\nRubio: FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS HOLY, I AM YOUR ONLY CHANCE! I HAVE SEEN HOW THIS UNFOLDS AND IT IS A NIGHTMARE. PICTURE THE WORST THING YOU CAN PICTURE. NOW DOUBLE THAT. NOW DOUBLE IT AGAIN. THEN PUT A COCKROACH ON IT. THAT IS THE TRUMP PRESIDENCY. WE HAVE TO STOP HIM, DO YOU HEAR ME? THAT IS WHY I WAS SENT BACK HERE! BUT IT\u2019S NOT WORKING. LOOK! ALREADY, I AM STARTING TO FADE! YOU CAN SEE THE PODIUM THROUGH MY TORSO! VOTE, VOTE NOW! IT IS OUR ONLY CHANCE, I TELL YOU!\n\nCruz: I am a true conservative who stands to the right of Trump on everything, if that helps. Does that help? And no one I have ever worked with likes me.\n\nRubio: (vanishing faster) STOP HELPING!\n\nTrump: This was fun. We all had fun tonight, didn\u2019t we, guys? (stabs a baby panda to death.
