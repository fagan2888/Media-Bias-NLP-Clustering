The four firms work with attorneys from the North Carolina Attorney General\u2019s Office to defend the state. As of January 2016, state had paid the four firms a total of $850,983.20. NCDOT defends its use of outside attorneys by pointing to the large volume of cases filed in recent years. \u201cBecause they did not have the internal legal resources to handle the high volume of cases, lawyers from the attorney generals office recommend the four outside counsel groups now representing the state in the 290 lawsuits filed against NCDOT, based on those firms\u2019 previous experience with the map act issue,\u201d NCDOT spokesman Mike Charbonneau said. One of the firms is that of North Carolina Senator Fletcher Hartsell (R-Cabarrus). Fletcher\u2019s firm, Hartsell & Williams in Concord, has just 18 cases but has billed more than a quarter million dollars since May 2015, invoices obtained by On Your Side Investigates show. Hartsell did not respond to multiple requests for comment seeking to clarify how his firm came to be hired by the state and what steps, if any, he takes to ensure there is no conflict of interest on his part.\n\nTo read more about the Map Act, click here.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "To read more about the Map Act, click here.\nHere\u2019s more:NCDOT has contracted with four law firms to defend itself against the hundreds of cases filed against it in court.\nNCDOT defends its use of outside attorneys by pointing to the large volume of cases filed in recent years.\nSince 2010, hundreds of landowners with property located within one of the protected corridors have filed lawsuits to compel the state to buy their land.\nThe four firms work with attorneys from the North Carolina Attorney General\u2019s Office to defend the state."}
