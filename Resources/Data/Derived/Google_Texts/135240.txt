Went to take a long walk by the Trinity River yesterday, only to find the Continental Ave.-entering path to the Trinity Skyline Trail blocked by a barricade, a Dallas police car and a “High Water” sign. Thing was, on Saturday the trails were good to go — high and dry next to a river made mighty in recent weeks by strong rains that have broken the drought’s five-year stranglehold on Dallas and the state.

But today the floodway is yet again flooded: The National Weather Service says the Trinity is at 35.67 feet at the time of this posting — more than five feet above minor flood stage — on its way to a projected 39 feet, which puts it between moderate and major flooding. Our media partners at KXAS-Channel 5 grabbed us aerial look-see below this morning — one in a series, I guess.

In case you’re wondering, that is a long way from levee-topping. That happens at 62 feet. Still: If they ever do built the Trinity River toll road along the east levee, city officials might think about investing in new-car lots filled with these. Ya know, just in case.
