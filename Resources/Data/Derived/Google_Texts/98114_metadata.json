According to the survey, 66 percent agree the news media has too much power and influence over elections. Eighty percent say special interest groups have too much power and influence, and 76 percent say the wealthiest individuals and companies do.\n\n\u201cRepublicans show slightly less concern about the influence of wealthy individuals and special interests on elections compared to Democrats and voters not affiliated with either party,\u201d Rasmussen Reports notes.\n\nA similar survey from 2014 found that 76 percent of likely voters said the wealthiest individuals and companies had too much influence over government decisions. A 2012 poll found that 75 percent of Americans said too much money is poured into politics.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the average voter understands that companies don\u2019t have votes, and wealthy individuals only have one vote\u2014and money doesn\u2019t buy election outcomes,\u201d Hans von Spakovsky, senior legal fellow in The Heritage Foundation\u2019s Edwin Meese III Center for Legal and Judicial Studies, told The Daily Signal.\n\n\u201cThe wealthiest candidates often lose elections\u2014character and their stands on issues is what counts, not who has the most money,\u201d von Spakovsky, who also manages the think tank\u2019s Election Law Reform Initiative, added.\n\nRasmussen Reports conducted the survey by calling 1,000 likely voters on Feb. 9 and 10. The survey has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A large number of voters are concerned about media's impact on elections.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A large number of voters are concerned about media's impact on elections.", "title": "Voters Think Media Has Too Much Power Over Elections", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160216_PoliticalInfluenceSurvey_Mork.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-17T18:37:47+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/218WUIK"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A large number of voters are concerned about media's impact on elections.", "title": "Voters Think Media Has Too Much Power Over Elections", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160216_PoliticalInfluenceSurvey_Mork.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Politics", "tag": "2016,elections", "published_time": "2016-02-17T15:18:52+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-17T18:37:47+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Rasmussen Reports, Elections, Influence, voters, media, politics, leaders, wealthy, special interest groups, survey"}, "article_summary": "Voters want more say in elections and less influence from the news media, special interest groups, and the wealthy, a new survey reveals.\nEighty percent say special interest groups have too much power and influence, and 76 percent say the wealthiest individuals and companies do.\nAccording to the survey, 66 percent agree the news media has too much power and influence over elections.\n\u201cRepublicans show slightly less concern about the influence of wealthy individuals and special interests on elections compared to Democrats and voters not affiliated with either party,\u201d Rasmussen Reports notes.\nA similar survey from 2014 found that 76 percent of likely voters said the wealthiest individuals and companies had too much influence over government decisions."}
