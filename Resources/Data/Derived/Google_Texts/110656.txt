After basically being gifted Oregon in the Cruz-Kasich alliance to defeat Donald Trump, team Kasich is facing criticism today after it was reported that the campaign failed to submit a bio and description of the candidate’s platform for Oregon’s voters’ guide:

How is John Kasich going to #StopTrump if he can't even get into the Oregon voters' guide? https://t.co/kyU0xR4Tzj pic.twitter.com/U558OPcgCy — Rolling Stone (@RollingStone) April 25, 2016

Kasich supposedly has an OR focus now yet SoS confirms they never got a bio/platform for the state's voter pamphlet https://t.co/5SLyKG2BID — Kailani Koenig (@kailanikm) April 25, 2016

We wonder if Ted Cruz knew about this Kasich error before the deal as he had 200 of his own volunteers ready to go in Oregon:

Or maybe Cruz did know it and he’s the one who “played” Kasich?

Did #Kasich just get played by #Cruz to get out of Indiana? Looks like Kasich has no ground in Oregon! https://t.co/lcMepWmUpB — Scottie Nell Hughes (@scottienhughes) April 26, 2016

Kasich was on the “Today” show this morning defending his decision to stop campaigning in Indiana, telling Matt Lauer his whole strategy isn’t about Trump but “stopping Hillary Clinton from being president.”

"I don't usually start an interview by saying I'm confused, but I'm confused." –@MLauer to @JohnKasich https://t.co/34Deqqysui — TODAY (@TODAYshow) April 26, 2016
