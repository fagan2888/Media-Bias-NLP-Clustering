Her people are poor and looked down upon, but they\u2019re also resourceful and know how to work together. In the end, it\u2019s those skills that allow Katniss and her friend Peeta to win the games against better-trained rivals from the wealthy capital.\n\nThe books are fiction, but many readers believe District 12 is set in a futuristic version of Appalachia\u2019s real-life coal country. And, these days, the real Appalachia needs all the resourcefulness and cooperation it can get.\n\nThe coal industry, which in many counties has dominated the economy for more than a century, is not providing the jobs it used to. Coal reserves are dwindling, mechanization has made it easier to pay fewer workers to extract more coal, and there\u2019s new competition from cheap natural gas. In Boone County, W. Va., for example, about 40 percent of coal jobs have disappeared since the end of 2011, according to research firm SNL Financial. And the same trend is going on across the region.\n\nYou could say Appalachia needs an army of real-life Katnisses \u2014 and, luckily, it\u2019s found them. The Highlander Center, a training center for social movements with deep roots in the South, just launched its \u201cAppalachian Transition Fellowship\u201d \u2014 a program to mentor and support 14 young Appalachians as they work on economic development projects throughout the region. Their goal is to accelerate the creation of a diverse economy by working on projects that create jobs and livelihoods in the wake of coal\u2019s decline.\n\nThrough this fellowship, Highlander\u2019s fellows will spend a full year working on economic transition projects in Tennessee, Kentucky, West Virginia, Virginia, Ohio, and North Carolina.\n\nI recently had a chance to meet the Appalachian Transition Fellows as they took a kick-off tour through the region. We talked about how they got interested in economic transition and what their fellowships will look like. Here\u2019s what a few of them had to say.\n\nName: Willa Johnson\n\nAge: 28\n\nHometown: McRoberts, Ky.\n\nIn the sixth grade, Willa was shopping for school supplies with her mom when an artificial pond broke down near her house. It had been full of wastewater left over from processing coal, and it sent a four-foot polluted wave down her mountain hollow. Everything but Willa\u2019s double-wide mobile home was wiped away, including her family\u2019s pool and much of their yard.\n\nBy the time she was 16 years old, the mold was so bad that her family had to move. They couldn\u2019t sell the house, either. It was uninhabitable.\n\nBy her early 20s, Willa thought she could help by fighting the coal companies that had caused disasters like the one she remembered from her childhood.\n\nSo she became a community organizer, but the work didn\u2019t go as expected. Willa\u2019s father was a coal truck driver. So was her brother. They didn\u2019t like what she was doing, and they weren\u2019t shy about saying so.\n\nOnce, when Willa was doing voter outreach at a festival, a neighbor said Willa was a disappointment to her father \u2014 and that he had told her so. Another time, at a family barbecue, an in-law accused Willa of \u201ctaking away jobs.\u201d Willa responded that her work was about protecting water and community. Then Willa\u2019s own brother ripped into Willa\u2019s stance against coal.\n\nAfter that incident, Willa and her brother didn\u2019t speak for a year and a half.\n\nShe burned out, left town, and had nothing to do with organizing for the next two years. Now she wants back in, but she wants to work on the growth and evolution of Appalachia \u2014 not on fighting King Coal.\n\nWilla\u2019s fellowship will be in North Carolina, where she will help local textile mill operators connect to a growing marketplace that wants more environmentally friendly and fair trade fabrics.\n\nName: Joshua Outsey\n\nAge: 28\n\nHometown: Birmingham, Ala.\n\nJoshua tells me about growing up young and black in Birmingham. If you wanted to \u201cbuild power\u201d \u2014 to grow a strong enough network to protect your friends and family \u2014 the most direct path was to join a gang. Josh took a step down this path, but got a wake-up call at age 18, when a gang orientation took a turn for the worse and shots were fired.\n\nJoshua moved to Knoxville and started hanging out with a group called Tribe One, an after-school program designed to give young black men a refuge from gang activities. It was there that he met his mentor, Stan Johnson, who taught him about other ways to build power. By coming up with a plan to organize a community, for example, a person could achieve a more lasting form of power.\n\nAt age 22, Joshua joined up with Johnson to co-found a group called Socially Equal Energy Efficient Development, or SEEED, a group that makes green jobs available to low-income people in Knoxville, Tenn. Josh helped organize neighborhood clean up days, \u201cempowerment hour\u201d workshops, and a door-to-door listening project to build support for home insulations.\n\n\u201cI started my own gang,\u201d Josh tells me.\n\nJoshua is starting a year-long fellowship with Kentuckians for the Commonwealth. He\u2019ll be working with the city of Benham, Ky., to insulate homes and make home heating more affordable.\n\nName: Kendall Bilbrey\n\nAge: 22\n\nHometown: Wytheville, Va.\n\nKendall\u2019s parents grew up in a company-owned Virginia mill town called Fries, and money was always a problem. They pushed hard work, a good education, and getting out of the mountains. Kendall obliged, went to Washington, D.C., and attended George Mason University \u2014 finishing in two and a half years.\n\nSummer of junior year, a friend invited Kendall to attend a summer retreat organized by the STAY Project. Founded in 2008, STAY is a youth-led group designed to build a community of young people from central Appalachia who care about each other and the region. Kendall, who was also coming to terms with being queer at the time, reported feeling more at home with the people at STAY than with the queer community in D.C.\n\nAfter graduating college, Kendall nabbed a research internship with the Smithsonian\u2019s National Zoo, which involved traveling to China to study red pandas for five months. After returning to Virginia, Kendall took pause to reflect: \u201cPeople line up for internships with Smithsonian programs, but they weren\u2019t lining up for Appalachia.\u201d\n\nStarting in June, Kendall will begin a fellowship with the Alliance for Appalachia, doing research and legwork to inform a potential federal campaign to unlock more resources for economic transition.\n\nName: Joey Aloi\n\nAge: 30\n\nHometown: Buckhannon, W.Va.\n\nJoey spent his high school years doing flood relief work in McDowell County, W.Va. It\u2019s not that it rains more there than in other counties, he says \u2014 it\u2019s just that the rain doesn\u2019t have anything to stick to. The deforested landscape of surface mines sent the water rolling down the hollers, overpowering the creeks and destroying houses.\n\nJoey tells me that after a day of throwing out people\u2019s mud-soaked belongings and knocking down walls, he\u2019d wipe out his nose, and his \u201cboogers would be covered in coal dust.\u201d As he grew increasingly aware of the connection between mining and flooding, he wanted to find a different way of thinking about the land and how we use it.\n\nJoey started by studying philosophy at Warren Wilson University, with a concentration in environmental ethics. He then enrolled in the PhD program in philosophy at the University of North Texas in Denton. He says that most of his fellow students are still there, writing their dissertations in the library or teaching undergraduates.\n\nBut Joey recently returned to West Virginia, where he will work on his dissertation in the evenings. During the day, he\u2019ll be working with the Greater Kanawha Valley Foundation in Charleston, W.Va., connecting local farmers with the city\u2019s hospitals, which serve more than 2.5 million meals a year.\n\nName: Carol Ann Davey\n\nAge: 26\n\nHometown: Columbus, Ohio\n\nCarol went to high school in Cheshire, Ohio \u2014 a tiny town in the southeastern corner of the state, shadowed by the two huge smokestacks of a coal-fired power plant.\n\nAs Carol was growing up, the owner of the plant, American Electric Power, was forced in a legal settlement to buy out every house in Cheshire because of sulphurous gas clouds and acid rain that had rendered the place uninhabitable. Over time, the people moved out and the company bulldozed their houses. She remembers riding the bus to school in the morning and seeing the city vanish block by block.\n\nAll the kids grew up being told the coal plant was \u201cwhere they made the clouds.\u201d No one seemed to want to dig any deeper into why this was happening. Carol, though, felt a creeping dread. She went to Kentucky for her undergraduate degree and then to Ireland to get her masters \u2014 but is committed to return to the region and give back.\n\nSo she\u2019ll return to Athens, Ohio \u2014 the closest city to what\u2019s left of Cheshire \u2014 for a fellowship with the Appalachian Center for Economic Networks, where she\u2019ll help local businesses develop more sustainable practices.\n\nName: Mae Humiston\n\nAge: 23\n\nHometown: Fairfield, Va.\n\nWhen Mae was in middle school, she suffered from some serious bullying. Mae didn\u2019t want her younger brother to see the same fate, and reasoned that if she \u201cbecome the most successful person in Rockbridge, Va.,\u201d the kids wouldn\u2019t mess with him. She set her sights on a high-powered career in international relations, and earned a scholarship to Tufts University.\n\nMae\u2019s first class on international relations made her miserable. Her work with the school\u2019s student garden, however, was sheer pleasure. From there, she expanded to working with small farms in the Boston and Washington, D.C. metro areas. After college, she got a job with a CSA farm, where she was on the edge of a promotion to crew manager.\n\nSoon she noticed all of her crew\u2019s farmers were getting \u201cparsnip burn\u201d: a nasty rash that comes from handling the plants without gloves. Mae tried to get her manager to pay attention, but instead he told her she was \u201ctoo weak for the job.\u201d The experience led to her current interest in farm workers\u2019 rights.\n\nMae\u2019s fellowship will be with the Community Farm Alliance in Hazard, Ky., where she\u2019ll help farmers get their produce to low-income communities.\n\nName: Catherine Moore\n\nAge: 32\n\nHometown: Charleston, W.Va.\n\nCatherine always had affection for her home state of West Virginia. When she was in college in Cambridge, Mass., she says, she hung a huge satellite map of the state on her wall.\n\nShe always assumed she\u2019d return, but maybe in her 40s \u2014 someday far off in the future. But it came sooner. While working on her PhD in Richmond, Va., Catherine took a dive into local history. It made the pain of being cut off and disconnected from her own place even sharper, she says.\n\nCatherine is now home, living in the New River Gorge of the southern part of the state, where the roots of her family tree crisscross the land. It\u2019s a tree that includes slave owners and coal barons, and part of the reason Catherine says she needs to be here is her desire to research and come to terms with these stories.\n\nCatherine tells me about how locals mourn what\u2019s been lost in West Virginia: the tens of thousands of coal jobs, the countless once-vibrant towns. But within the loss is an opportunity.\n\n\u201cMost of all, I am struck by the sheer potential for radical self-definition that this moment holds,\u201d she says. It\u2019s \u201cthe chance to write our own story, to find our own words for who we are and who we want to become.\u201d\n\nCatherine will spend her fellowship working on the \u201cWhat\u2019s Next, West Virginia?\u201d project \u2014 a year of listening events around the state designed to help residents have a conversation about their vision for a new economic future and to help them act on it together.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.date": "2014-07-27 08:03:07", "sailthru.author": "Joe Solomon", "application-name": "Grist", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/image-9.jpeg?w=640"}, "site": "grist", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.tags": "climate-energy, politics, joe-solomon", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://grist.org/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/330e84b0272aae748d059cd70e3f8f8d?s=16", "pocket-site-verification": "600c3e036c3d0b8412be38a78681c7", "syndication-source": "http://www.yesmagazine.org/commonomics/these-young-people-are-pioneering-a-post-coal-economy-in-appalachia", "sailthru.title": "These young people are pioneering Appalachia\u2019s post-coal economy", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/image-9.jpeg?w=50", "description": "The Appalachian Transition Fellows are young people who will spend this year building diverse job opportunities in the coal-country counties that need them most.", "robots": "noodp", "msapplication-tooltip": "We're an online news organization that uses humor to interpret green issues & inspire environmental action.", "fb": {"app_id": 548917378618963}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/grist.org", "published_time": "2014-07-27T12:03:07+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-28T16:35:46+00:00"}, "sailthru.description": "The Appalachian Transition Fellows are young people who will spend this year building diverse job opportunities in the coal-country counties that need them most.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "Grist", "description": "The Appalachian Transition Fellows are young people who will spend this year building diverse job opportunities in the coal-country counties that need them most.", "title": "These young people are pioneering Appalachia\u2019s post-coal economy", "url": "http://grist.org/climate-energy/these-young-people-are-pioneering-appalachias-post-coal-economy/", "image": {"width": 555, "identifier": "https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/image-9.jpeg?w=555&h=369&crop=1", "height": 369}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "c293daabda398bd8ceee45abea0b3201"}, "sailthru.image.full": "https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/image-9.jpeg"}, "article_summary": "In Boone County, W.
