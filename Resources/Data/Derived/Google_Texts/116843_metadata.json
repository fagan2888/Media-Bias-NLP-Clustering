Mike Pence\u2019s handling of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Playing sloppy offense and porous defense, the Hoosier governor seemed to alienate both sides of the debate last week.\n\nNow some believe Pence has bounced himself from the Republican presidential bracket.\n\nA compelling speaker with a record of balanced budgets and broad support from social conservatives, Pence had been floated as a dark-horse candidate for the GOP\u2019s 2016 nomination. Then the religious freedom debate erupted.\n\nOn March 26, Pence signed into law the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which prohibits the state from \u201csubstantially burdening a person\u2019s exercise of religion,\u201d unless the government can demonstrate a \u201ccompelling interest\u201d to violate this right and does so only by \u201cthe least restrictive means.\u201d\n\nProponents called the law good policy, and opponents labeled it a license to discriminate against gays and lesbians. Quin Hillyer of National Review saw it as a political opportunity.\n\nThis was \u201cPence\u2019s moment to shine,\u201d he said. It was a chance to explain, \u201cReagan-like, above the heads of the media, directly to the people.\u201d\n\nBut before a national audience, Pence came under intense scrutiny. On ABC News\u2019 \u201cThis Week,\u201d Pence sparred with host George Stephanopoulos and pledged \u201cnot to change the law.\u201d Five days later, he did.\n\nFacing pressure from outside groups, Pence signed new legislation Thursday specifically exempting sexual orientation and gender identity from the original statute.\n\n\u201cThe governor looked confused, reckless and craven,\u201d Hillyer says of Pence\u2019s legislative double dribble. \u201cHe completely ended his 2016 chances.\u201d\n\nDaily Caller columnist Matt Lewis said Pence \u201cessentially angered everyone.\u201d Now Pence\u2019s opponents have \u201cbranded him a bigot\u201d and \u201chis social conservative defenders now see him, at best, as a poor communicator, and at worst, as a wimp.\u201d\n\nMost of the potential 2016 Republican hopefuls quickly voiced their support for Indiana\u2019s religious freedom legislation. On the Democratic side, only Hillary Clinton publicly opposed the law.\n\nTony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, said this provides a glimpse of the national presidential election.\n\n\u201cCandidates were so quick to jump on this because they\u2019re out there every day talking to people \u2026 and they know where Americans are when it comes to religious freedom,\u201d Perkins said.\n\nJohn Lewis of Marriage Equality USA agrees gay marriage and religious liberty will play a central role in the next election.\n\n\u201cIn the last 10 years, we\u2019ve seen that America has awakened and Indiana has awakened\u201d to the fact that the \u201cLGBT community is part of the fabric of America just like everybody else.\u201d\n\nLewis predicts \u201ca significant political cost\u201d for candidates \u201cwho don\u2019t recognize the common humanity of LGBT Americans.\u201d\n\nAlthough he disagrees with Republican candidates\u2019 support for the legislation, \u201csomeone in opposition isn\u2019t an enemy,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re a future ally. We\u2019re seeing more and more allies and future allies.\u201d\n\nAfter signing the new legislation Thursday, Pence departed for Europe to vacation with his family for the Easter holiday. When he returns, he\u2019s likely to need to make a decision about a 2016 campaign or return to life in the governor\u2019s mansion.\n\nUnlike other potential presidential candidates, Pence hasn\u2019t aggressively courted donors or lined up out-of-state supporters. Instead, he has hired mostly Hoosier campaign staff and kept an otherwise low profile. But even if Pence had made serious plans to run for president, Matt Lewis says the religious freedom controversy \u201ceffectively closes that option.\u201d\n\nPerkins agrees Pence no longer fits the presidential profile. \u201cConservatives are looking for a candidate with an aura about them that doesn\u2019t say retreat.\u201d They want someone, he says, \u201cwho will move forward, who won\u2019t look back, and unfortunately, Mike didn\u2019t do that.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Mike Pence had been floated as a dark-horse candidate for the GOP\u2019s 2016 nomination.
