David Axelrod has seen a side of President Barack Obama about which most of us can only speculate.

He’s flown with Obama on Air Force One, crafted crucial components of campaign strategy, and even kept secrets that could have led to political disaster if they were leaked. As Obama’s chief campaign adviser in 2008, Axelrod directed the campaign that put the first black president in office, and then went on to become Obama’s senior adviser during his first administration. Now, he’s pulling the tarp off of it all in his new memoir, “Believer: My Forty Years in Politics.”

As President Obama defies criticism of a lame-duck presidency through a slew of executive actions and an assertive State of the Union speech, Axelrod sheds new light on how the President got to this point. From meeting Obama in Chicago to working on his reelection campaign in 2012, Axelrod shaped Obama’s trajectory through messaging, coordination, debate prep, and more.

Does David Axelrod’s memoir give a more complex understanding of President Obama? Can the politics be separated from the man? And how will this book shape the narrative for Obama’s legacy and 2016?
