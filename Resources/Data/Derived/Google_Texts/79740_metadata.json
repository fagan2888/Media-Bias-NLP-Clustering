Miller reported all the gifts on financial disclosure statements.\n\nThe nonprofit foundation, however, doesn\u2019t have to disclose its donors because it is registered with the Internal Revenue Service as a \u201csocial welfare\u201d organization. It also can receive unlimited contributions. The group is aligned with several GOP organizations, including the Republican Attorneys General Association, and typically targets Democrats.\n\nMatthew Walter, executive director of the foundation, discounted the complaint.\n\n\u201cClearly, Miller and his cronies want to shut down free speech about his high flying lifestyle and record of hypocrisy,\u201d Walter said in a statement. \u201cMiller has already shown he\u2019ll go to great lengths \u2014 even refusing to follow Nevada\u2019s transparency laws until we took him to court \u2014 to hide information about his activities. Nevadans deserve to have a leader with integrity, not have Ross Miller use front groups to try and intimidate us from exposing his party boy lifestyle.\u201d\n\nThe secretary of state has a record of fighting third-party groups that protect identities of donors or fail to file paperwork to operate in Nevada. But last fall Miller lost a key case he filed in Nevada against Americans for Prosperity, a group partly funded by David and Charles Koch.\n\nA judge in Carson City ruled on Oct. 17 that AFP wasn\u2019t required to register with the secretary of state\u2019s office or file campaign contribution and expense forms. The case involved AFP fliers attacking then-Assemblyman Kelvin Atkinson, D-North Las Vegas, who successfully ran for the state Senate, for backing a renewable energy bill. The fliers didn\u2019t call for voters to reject Atkinson or vote for his opponent, however.\n\nSimilarly, the 30-second ad by the State Government Leadership Foundation doesn\u2019t call for voting against Miller and doesn\u2019t mention his main Republican opponent, attorney Adam Laxalt.\n\nThe ad can be seen at bit.ly/1npDr2v and the website is millershouseofcards.com.\n\nContact reporter Laura Myers at lmyers@reviewjournal.com or 702-387-2919.
