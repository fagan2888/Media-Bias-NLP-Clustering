Hoyer is a longtime advocate of free trade, but the Democratic leadership in the House of Representatives has been trying to present a united front by withholding commitments to vote one way or the other while saying that they are looking for a way to \u201cget to \u2018Yes.\u2019\u201d\n\nRelated: CBO Chief Explains How Bad Our Budgets Can Get\n\nRepublicans plainly don\u2019t have the votes necessary to pass the bill with just their own members so Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and her caucus are holding out for possible policy concessions from the GOP.\n\nThat has left Hoyer in an awkward position. He has strongly supported trade deals but so far has not taken a definitive position on the TPP. But it\u2019s not for lack of trying on the part of Washington reporters.\n\nIn an interview with Bloomberg TV on Tuesday, host Betty Liu asked about the prospects of the TPA bill, which the Senate is expected to pass this week, and the eventual vote on the TPP deal.\n\nHoyer said that his support for the trade deal is truly up in the air.\n\n\u201cI, frankly, have voted for trade deals in the past, but I am looking at this one very, very closely to see whether or not it is, in fact, in the best interest of our country and our economy and jobs for our people,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a pen and pad briefing with reporters on Tuesday, Hoyer was again asked if he had decided how he would be voting.\n\n\u201cNo, I have not,\u201d he said.\n\nMaybe three really is a charm. In another appearance in Washington on Tuesday, facing questions from CNN chief congressional correspondent Dana Bash, Hoyer seemed to come pretty close to indicating that he will ultimately support the trade deal.\n\nRelated: McConnell Says TPA Will Counter Chinese Dominance\n\n\u201cSo far there is no member of the House Democratic Leadership that has come out in favor of trade,\u201d Bash began. \u201cWhat\u2019s your position?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m part of the Democratic leadership,\u201d Hoyer began.\n\n\u201cI know, but you haven\u2019t come out opposed to it either,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not opposed to it either\u2026. \u201d\n\n\u201cAre you a yes or a no?\u201d\n\n\u201cRemain flexible,\u201d Hoyer said. \u201cAnd I remain flexible to this day. But it was a good try.\u201d\n\nRelated: Obama v. Warren on Fast Track: Why This Fight Is Getting So Nasty\n\nHoyer went on to say that the biggest problem with getting trade legislation through Congress is that \u201cthe majority of the public\u2026 [has] expressed great reservations about whether or not trade bills have been positive for jobs and growth in our country.\u201d\n\nDo you have reservations? Bash asked.\n\n\u201cI believe trade growth is a positive force,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I think we have though is that globalization and trade growth since 1992 have gone hand-in-hand.\u201d\n\nRelated: Senators Reach Deal to Move on with Fast Track Trade Bill\n\nHoyer said there is no doubt that globalization has led to the offshoring of American jobs, but he said he believes the U.S. has the potential to begin bringing many of those jobs back home again.\n\nBack on the topic of TPP, Hoyer referred to an article published Tuesday in The New York Times in which he said former Obama Chief of Staff Bill Daley \u201cargued very persuasively\u2026about how trade is good for our country.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou do not sound like someone who\u2019s going to vote against this trade bill,\u201d Bash said.\n\n\u201cWell, I hope I don\u2019t sound like someone who\u2019s going to telegraph what I\u2019m going to do, and I say that because I am one of the leaders in our caucus and Nancy Pelosi has said we want to do some things to try to get to yes and we have been doing a lot of very extensive informational meetings with the administration with other experts.\u201d\n\nThe meetings, he said, were part of an effort to get Democratic members of the House comfortable that the doom-and-gloom scenarios being painted by opponents of the trade pact and TPA won\u2019t come to pass.\n\nRelated: House Speaker Boehner Upbeat on Fast Track Prospects\n\nIt wasn\u2019t clear on Tuesday, though, how close Hoyer would be to Pelosi when the issues come to a vote.\n\nPelosi last week criticized TPA in her weekly press conference. \u201cIt is effectively a six-year, I don\u2019t want to say \u2018get out of jail free\u2019 but it\u2019s something to that effect, a \u2018carte blanche.\u2019\u201d\n\nContrast that with Hoyer, who on Tuesday seemed quite unconcerned about giving the President fast track authority. He said he had recently asked a Republican colleague about giving the president Trade Promotion Authority.\n\n\u201cHe kind of shrugged his shoulders and said, \u2018We do 95 percent of the things around here with a closed rule anyway. What\u2019s the difference?\u2019 Fast track is simply a closed rule.\u201d (In a closed rule, a bill is brought to the floor of the House for a vote without allowing members to offer amendments.)\n\nBash asked him if Hoyer regretted any of his votes in favor of trade bills in the past.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t. Not at all.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer has long been a supporter of free trade deals.
