He believes his experience in competitive team environments as team leader and team captain have provided leadership skills that are required to be mayor.\n\n\"I think that the city is missing leadership for sure,\" he said.\n\nA supporter of a moratorium on hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, to recover oil and gas in Loveland, Grewal sees fracking as the only new issue since he ran for mayor in 2009. He's still concerned about downtown -- empty buildings, still-pending projects such as the Feed and Grain.\n\n\"We need to be proactive in strengthening our core first and filling our empty buildings,\" Grewal said. \"We will be only as strong as our core in the long run.\"\n\nAnd don't get him started on the temporary art plaza at Lincoln Avenue and Third Street. The city hopes that plaza will be purchased in the near future, but Grewal thinks benches and a gazebo would have been a better way to spend money.\n\nIt's one of the ways Grewal is concerned about Loveland's spending.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe also said that last year's branding effort baffled him and he questions recent economic incentive packages.\n\n\"The way we hand out money for people to stay here is not well thought through,\" Grewal said. \"A business has to have a commitment to community.\"\n\nGrewal has been active in advocacy for the homeless and said his background and experience as an artisan and blue-collar business owner also sets him apart from other candidates.\n\nJessica Maher can be reached at 669-5050, ext. 516, or maherj@reporter-herald.com.
