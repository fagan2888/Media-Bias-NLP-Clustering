Lebanon. In the past six months, she estimates the mix for new enrollees has been 70-30 for a supplement plan. Just a few years ago, it was 70-30 for Medicare Advantage.\n\nNow when she describes the options to clients, she said, \u201cMost people are like, \u2018Why wouldn\u2019t everyone take a supplement?\u2019\u201d\n\nBill McKendree, coordinator for Allegheny County\u2019s Apprise program, which helps seniors choose a Medicare plan, says the staff at the program has noticed a similar pattern.\n\n\u201cWhen individuals new to Medicare are presented with balanced, objective and comprehensive descriptions of both Medigaps and Advantage plans, there is a better than a 60 percent likelihood that they will select coverage through Medicare parts A and B supplemented with a Medigap,\u201d he said.\n\nIf new Medicare recipients want to go that route, they need to jump on the supplement option quickly. Rules governing the plans can make it impractical to switch to traditional Medicare once someone has coverage through a Medicare Advantage plan for more than 12 months.\n\nFederal law does not require private insurers to offer Medigap supplement plans to someone who has had Medicare Advantage coverage for more than a year \u2014 and Affordable Care Act-like protections for pre-existing conditions do not apply. Insurers can decline to issue Medigap coverage or charge higher premiums for pre-existing medical conditions.\n\nWithout that supplement coverage, Medicare beneficiaries are left with Parts A and B but without high-end limits on their out-of-pocket costs. In general, Part A covers hospital care, skilled nursing facility care and hospice. Part B covers outpatient services such as physician office visits, home health care and some preventive care.\n\nHighmark/?UPMC concerns\n\nAnother draw for straight Medicare plus Medigap may be a fear of losing access to certain doctors.\n\nDespite last year\u2019s state Supreme Court ruling giving Pittsburgh-based insurer Highmark\u2019s Medicare Advantage members in-network access to UPMC physicians and facilities through June 2019, Mr. McKendree said, a seed of uncertainty has been planted in many people\u2019s minds about whether they will be able to keep seeing the providers they want.\n\n\u201cEssentially all\u201d of Apprise clients already in a Medicare Advantage plan \u201cexpressed a concern in being able to access their physicians and health care facilities given the Highmark-UPMC dispute,\u201d he said.\n\nMore than half chose a plan based on which system their current doctors were affiliated.\n\n\u201cEven after the court\u2019s ruling,\u201d he said, \u201cclients expressed a reluctance to trust any guarantee any longer.\u201d\n\nAdvantage advantages\n\nTo be sure, Medicare Advantage plans have appealing features \u2014 notably low premiums and a $6,700 yearly limit on out-of-pocket costs.\n\nPrecise estimates for how many local seniors have chosen a Medicare Advantage plan are difficult to pin down, said Mr. McKendree, and range from a low of 30 percent to 60 percent or higher.\n\nThe plans typically include Parts A and B, prescription drugs and may also include vision and some dental and hearing aid coverage. Some will even throw in a gym membership.\n\n\u201cThe people who are in generally good health and they\u2019re fit, they don\u2019t blink when it comes to taking a Medicare Advantage plan,\u201d said Glenn Wells, owner of Single Source Benefits in Upper St. Clair. He estimates the lower-premium Medicare Advantage plans comprise 95 percent of his Medicare business.\n\n\u201cIf they have an episode in five years, they\u2019ve saved a ton of money in premiums and you don\u2019t even know if that $6,700 is going to come into play.\u201d\n\nMr. McKendree agreed it can work out that way for some people, but there\u2019s a risk. \u201cIt\u2019s the same reason you go to a casino: You believe you\u2019re lucky. If everything goes right, you\u2019ve saved the cost of the premiums.\u201d If it doesn\u2019t, there is still the $6,700 limit safety net.\n\nBut, he added, that also underscores the gravity of any initial decision to forgo a Medicare supplement plan. If, years later, medical problems start to mount, \u201cYou may never have the same access to a Medigap again.\u201d\n\nDealing with more plans\n\nGetting coverage under traditional Medicare with a supplement does take work.\n\nInstead of having one Medicare Advantage plan, you have three plans \u2014 traditional Medicare Parts A and B, a choice among multiple Medigap supplement plans and a prescription plan.\n\nIf that seems daunting, Ms. Leckenby points out that seniors can have the Medicare portion taken from their Social Security check and auto-deduct the Medigap premium to the insurer.\n\nMr. McKendree said he considers having a separate Part D plan a plus because people can shop for the best deal each year rather than being restricted to whatever comes with a Medicare Advantage package.\n\nMs. Leckenby said many clients are finding the Medicare-Medigap package is simply a better value.\n\nOne recent client was able to purchase a Medigap supplement plan that offered no out-of-pocket costs for $135 a month, or $1,620 a year.\n\nThe client did have to pay extra for prescription drug coverage but still \u201cthat\u2019s 100 percent [coverage] for chemo. That\u2019s 100 percent for everything. You go into a hospital and you don\u2019t pay a dime.\u201d\n\nHer speculation is that many beneficiaries in the past have opted for Medicare Advantage \u201cbecause they were on Highmark all their working lives and they just went to Highmark. It\u2019s all they knew.\n\n\u201cNow people are a little more savvy.\u201d\n\nSteve Twedt: stwedt@post-gazette.com or 412-263-1963.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "AP > Money  |", "og": {"url": "http://readingeagle.com/ap/article/new-enrollees-rethinking-medicare-advantage-option", "site_name": "Reading Eagle", "type": "article", "description": "For years, Medicare Advantage plans have been big business for private insurers offering one-stop shopping, low premiums and extra benefits to an agi", "title": "New enrollees rethinking Medicare Advantage option | Reading Eagle - AP"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://readingeagle.com/ap/article/new-enrollees-rethinking-medicare-advantage-option", "site": "@ReadingEagle", "card": "summary", "title": "New enrollees rethinking Medicare Advantage option | Reading Eagle - AP"}, "robots": "index,follow", "fb": {"app_id": 177057515645359}, "keywords": "AP > Money  |", "article": {"section": "AP"}, "description": "For years, Medicare Advantage plans have been big business for private insurers offering one-stop shopping, low premiums and extra benefits to an agi"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI\u2019ve definitely seen a huge drop-off in Medicare Advantage,\u201d said Shari Leckenby, with Medicare Specialists of Pittsburgh in Mt.\nHe estimates the lower-premium Medicare Advantage plans comprise 95 percent of his Medicare business.\nInstead of having one Medicare Advantage plan, you have three plans \u2014 traditional Medicare Parts A and B, a choice among multiple Medigap supplement plans and a prescription plan.\nWithout that supplement coverage, Medicare beneficiaries are left with Parts A and B but without high-end limits on their out-of-pocket costs.\nRules governing the plans can make it impractical to switch to traditional Medicare once someone has coverage through a Medicare Advantage plan for more than 12 months."}
