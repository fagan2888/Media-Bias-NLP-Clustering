After watching Peyton Manning throw four INTs, I have to wonder: Has the Manning window closed? With this offensive line, I can\u2019t see the Broncos winning this year.\n\n\u2014 Jake, Marion, Iowa\n\nJake \u2013 You\u2019re parading out the elephant in the Dove Valley headquarters.\n\nFor now, I\u2019d be careful about making declarative statements. The window may be closing on the Manning Broncos Super Bowl run, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s closed.\n\nThe Broncos are capable of making a 3-0 run in the postseason.\n\nLet\u2019s go through this a step at a time. The Broncos should beat the Oakland Raiders on Sunday, a playoff game of sorts because it would mean they would advance past the postseason\u2019s first round.\n\nAnd it would not be an upset if in the second round, the Broncos while playing at home defeat the Bengals, Colts or Steelers. So now our scenario has the Broncos in the AFC championship game.\n\nRight now, it doesn\u2019t look like they can beat the Patriots in New England. Can they beat them there on Jan. 11? It would probably take the Pats committing two turnovers. It would take Aqib Talib and Rahim Moore double-teaming Rob Gronkowski.\n\nStrong safety T.J. Ward (neck) and linebacker Brandon Marshall (foot) would have to come back healthy.\n\nIt would take quarterback Peyton Manning having a solid, no-pick game and maybe Julius Thomas or Emmanuel Sanders have a great game (I think Bill Belichick will take away Demaryius Thomas).\n\nAnd it would take punter Britton Colquitt booting the ball so high Julian Edelman can\u2019t return it, even if it means Colquitt punting a few yards shorter than usual.\n\nLet\u2019s stop there before we talk about the Broncos\u2019 chances against the NFC representative in the Super Bowl.\n\nIt would take a lot to get there. But to become Super Bowl champs, you have to do a lot. Including beating the Patriots on the road. Merry Christmas, Jake!\n\nMike \u2013 Pretty much all season I\u2019ve been thinking about a Broncos quarterback, but not the current one. I remember watching as John Elway said something to the effect of his mind wants to and knows what to do, but his body can\u2019t do it anymore. I hope we win the Super Bowl, but what are the chances that John has a talk with Peyton and convinces him the flutter-ball just isn\u2019t going to cut it anymore? I doubt we\u2019ll be a contender next year with Brock Osweiler, but we won\u2019t win a Super Bowl with a 40-year-old Peyton either, so what\u2019s the point?\n\n\u2014 Brandon, La Crosse, Wis.\n\nBrandon \u2013 Peyton Manning will turn 39 on March 24. I say John Elway sits Manning down in early March and says: \u201cYou\u2019re my guy. We\u2019re going to fortify the offensive line. We want you to lead this team for two more years.\u201d\n\nLike most people, Brandon, you\u2019re comparing Manning of 2014 to Manning\u2019s career-best season of 2013. It was the best quarterback season in NFL history, save the Super Bowl.\n\nIt\u2019s not falling into place this year like it did last year for Manning. But there\u2019s a reason why they don\u2019t call it a twice-in-a-lifetime season.\n\nCompared to the rest of the NFL, where would you put Manning? Even if you grade him harshly and unfairly and rank him behind Rodgers, Romo, Brady, Brees, Luck, Big Ben, Wilson and Rivers, he\u2019s still a top 9 quarterback. You can win a Super Bowl with a top 9 quarterback.\n\nLooking at that list, I don\u2019t think anyone would rank Manning below the top 5. Maybe top 5 doesn\u2019t seem so good a year after he was No. 1. But he\u2019s still top 5. Merry Christmas, Brandon!\n\nHi, Mike. Is it me or are the Broncos the most overrated, most overhyped, most overpaid team in the league? I live in Patriots country, and every day I have to listen to these clowns talk about how much better the Pats are than the Broncos with a less talented team. I hate to say it, Mike, but they may have a valid point! Trust me: It kills me to even say that. Thanks, Mike.\n\n\u2014 John Miller, Brattleboro, Vt.\n\nJohn \u2013 The Broncos had nine Pro Bowlers, most in the NFL. The Patriots had five.\n\nBut it was a disgrace that Pats linebacker Jamie Collins didn\u2019t make it. I don\u2019t watch the Patriots but a couple times a year, but doesn\u2019t their defense start with tackle Vince Wilfork?\n\nIn New England, the talk is safety Devin McCourty was a major snub. And if I was building a team, I\u2019d want Julian Edelman and Rob Ninkovich on it.\n\nI don\u2019t need the Pro Bowl selections to tell me the Patriots have just as much talent as the Broncos. Merry Christmas, John!\n\nDo we lead the league in special-teams penalties? It seems that all year we take big losses or decent returns back due to dumb penalties on punts and kickoffs.\n\n\u2014 Ryan, Littleton\n\nRyan \u2013 The Broncos have committed 20 special-teams penalties, tied for seventh-most in the league. This is especially alarming when considering the Broncos have fewer kickoff-coverage plays than most teams because of their 66.3 percent touchback rate.\n\nSpecial-teams coverage was a major problem at Cincinnati, where the Broncos surrendered a staggering 206 return yards.\n\nIn fairness to special teams coordinator Jeff Rodgers, the key players on coverage units are linebackers. The Broncos lost Danny Trevathan and Nate Irving to injury, meaning top special teamers Steven Johnson and Brandon Marshall must be saved for defense.\n\nWhen Marshall hurt his foot and didn\u2019t play, the Broncos had to call on undrafted rookie Todd Davis to play linebacker. That means special teams are down to their third- and fourth-string linebackers.\n\nThis was the problem at the end of last season, too, when the Broncos lost so many defensive starters to injuries. The special teamers have to play defense, meaning special teams have to be filled by rookies or free agents signed off the street.\n\nStill, I think all those touchbacks at home hurt the Broncos\u2019 coverage units on the road. It\u2019s kind of like the Rockies pounding the ball at Coors Field and getting consistently shut down on the road.\n\nThe Broncos\u2019 coverage is different at home than it is on the road. That\u2019s my theory, anyway. Then again during my days as a ballwriter, I know people got tired of my altitude at home/sea level on the road explanation as to why the Rockies will always find it difficult to win over a 162-game season. (How many division titles have the Rockies won in 22 years again?)\n\nMerry Christmas, Ryan!\n\nHi, Mike, love your work and the mailbag. It seems like it has become typical this time of year to hear reports of the Broncos\u2019 coordinators being sought out by other teams for head coaching jobs. As happy as I am that it means the Broncos and their coaches had yet another successful season, the thought of losing Jack Del Rio and Adam Gase does put a bit of a damper on my holiday cheer. Do you think there\u2019s any chance that the Grinch won\u2019t steal our coordinators this year?\n\n\u2014 Teresa, San Francisco Bay Area, Calif.\n\nTeresa \u2013 With or without Del Rio or Gase, may you have Merry Christmas! There is a real good chance the Broncos lose both Del Rio and Gase after this season. I wrote about this a couple weeks back.\n\nDel Rio in particular is ready to move up and move on. He\u2019s an experienced head coach and coming off a nice three-year run with the Broncos that included a 3-1 mark as interim head coach while John Fox was recovering from a heart valve replacement procedure last year.\n\nGase is the most talented of the young head coaching candidates. With the exception of perhaps the late Bill Walsh, there\u2019s no such thing as an offensive genius. Gase, though, coordinated an offense that set NFL records by passing the ball last year, and he successfully schemed a running game in midseason this year.\n\nI also think it\u2019s time for Broncos running backs coach Eric Studesville to start getting some interviews.\n\nMike \u2013 When Mike Shanahan drafted Jay Cutler, I suspect that he planned on Cutler getting solid expert coaching. But because Shanahan was fired and Josh McDaniels gave up on him quickly and shipped him to Chicago, Cutler never got the top-notch coaching that would have made him a good QB. If Cutler had stayed with Shanahan, he\u2019d be a much better player. Your thoughts?\n\n\u2014 Fred Waiss, Prairie du Chien, Wis.\n\nFred \u2013 Teachers matter, no doubt. But the responsibility still lies with the student. I will give you the possibility that had the Broncos kept Shanahan, Cutler would have been a better quarterback.\n\nBut it wouldn\u2019t have been better for the Broncos. It was time for Shanny to move on as a coach. I\u2019m glad Shanahan the man is still living in the Denver area. As a head coach, Shanahan had 14 years and it was a successful run. But there was just one playoff win in his last 10 seasons. The Broncos took a step back with McDaniels but it led to John Elway, John Fox, Peyton Manning and better days ahead.\n\nCutler got good coaching in Chicago. He was a big Jeremy Bates guy here and the Bears brought him in for a year. Lovie Smith was a quality coach before Cutler and in Cutler\u2019s first four years with the Bears.\n\nCutler has gone through several offensive coordinators and head coaches. Here\u2019s the deal: He throws too many interceptions. He doesn\u2019t have the leadership DNA commonly found in successful quarterbacks.\n\nTo a degree those flaws are on his teachers. Mostly I think this is about a student who has been difficult to teach. Merry Christmas, Fred!\n\nWould you support a petition to ask John Elway and the Denver Broncos to retire Terrell Davis\u2019 No. 30 jersey as the greatest running back in Broncos history and to assist in his enshrinement into the Pro Football Hall of Fame?\n\n\u2014 Rich, Denver\n\nRich \u2013 The Broncos have been relatively inclusive with their Ring of Fame and exclusive with retiring numbers. I like it that way. There are 27 Ring of Famers. There might be one or two from the formative years who wouldn\u2019t have made it given the context of 55 seasons. But they meant a lot to the franchise then.\n\nThere are only three numbers retired: Frank Tripucka\u2019s 18; Floyd Little\u2019s 44 and John Elway\u2019s 7. When Peyton Manning retires, maybe they can re-retire 18.\n\nI do think Terrell Davis should be in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. At the very least, I hope that after making the cut to 25 semifinalists for a ninth consecutive year that Davis will be among the 15 modern-era finalists for the first time when they are announced early next month.\n\nBut I say his No. 30 stay with David Bruton. To you, Rich, and to all the mailbaggers, I wish you a Merry Christmas!\n\nPose a Broncos- or NFL-related question for the Broncos Mailbag.
