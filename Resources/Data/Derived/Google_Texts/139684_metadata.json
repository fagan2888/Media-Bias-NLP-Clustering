And while overall smoking rates are on the decline, the cross-generational effects could obviate cessation\u2019s benefits \u2014 Britain recently passed a law, effective next year, that bans smoking in cars while children are present. Now, researchers at Imperial College London suggest there\u2019s evidence to limit smoking in homes, despite the obvious hurdle of enforcement.\n\n\u201cPassive smoking in the home and in cars is damaging to the lungs,\u201d lead researcher Professor Peter Barnes told Medical Daily. \u201cWhat our study shows is that it can stop a key asthma treatment \u2014 inhaled steroids \u2014 from working properly, so it means that asthma is not as well-controlled.\u201d\n\nCritically, the team found in their small study of 19 children that the nine kids who came from homes where the parents smoked showed substantially lower levels of the enzyme HDAC2, which must be present for the anti-inflammatory steroid component of asthma medication to do its job. Cigarette smoke contains harmful oxidants that can introduce free radicals into the body \u2014 unstable molecules that can replicate to the point of cell death. Children whose parents smoked had HDAC2 levels half that of the non-smoking group.\n\nAs a respiratory disease, asthma is characterized by chronic inflammation in a person\u2019s airways that makes breathing difficult. To offset the inflammation, asthmatics typically rely on an inhaler to deliver a corticosteroid, which binds to certain receptors in the body\u2019s cells to stop the abnormal inflammation signal. Children who live in smoking homes, Barnes explains, were shown to have the same resistance to these steroids as adults who actively smoke.\n\nSo what hope of protection do children have if a parent smokes at home? The ideal solution, at least in Barnes\u2019 eyes, is banning smoking at home when children are present, much in the same way the forthcoming ban will apply to cars. The obvious obstacle, however, is that no police officer will post up by the laundry room, waiting for an unsuspecting parent to pass by. A more realistic goal is education.\n\n\u201cAlthough banning smoking in the home with children is desirable it would be very difficult to enforce,\u201d Barnes said, \u201cso we can best reduce this by education of the general public about the harm of cigarette smoking in enclosed spaces such as houses and cars.\u201d\n\nMany parents, for instance, probably don\u2019t know that the toxic chemicals pouring out of their cigarettes eventually settle on the furniture around their house, putting kids at risk for \u201cthird-hand smoke.\u201d Or that smoking endangers a family\u2019s pets as much as it does babies and children. The overall goal, Barnes argues, is painting smoking as a public health concern, not a personal choice of self-destruction. For the million or so kids in the UK with asthma, and the millions more worldwide, Barnes said in a news release, the study highlights how pervasive the habit can be.\n\n\u201cThe mechanism we\u2019ve identified,\u201d he said, \u201cwill be a target for new treatments to help children with severe asthma.\u201d\n\nSource: Kobayashi Y, Bossley C, Gupta A, et al.
