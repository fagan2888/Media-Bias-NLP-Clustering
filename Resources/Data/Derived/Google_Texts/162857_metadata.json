Vito Barbieri came as the House State Affairs Committee heard nearly three hours of testimony on a bill that would ban doctors from prescribing abortion-inducing medication through telemedicine.\n\nDr. Julie Madsen was testifying in opposition to the bill when Barbieri asked the question. Madsen replied that would be impossible because swallowed pills do not end up in the vagina.\n\nThe committee approved the bill 13-4 on a party-line vote. Barbieri, who sits on the board of a crisis pregnancy center in northern Idaho, voted in favor of the legislation.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Lawmaker asks if swallowed camera be used for female exam", "title": "Lawmaker asks if swallowed camera be used for female exam", "og": {"url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/02/23/lawmaker_asks_if_swallowed_camera_be_used_for_female_exam/", "site_name": "Salon", "type": "article", "description": "Lawmaker asks if swallowed camera be used for female exam", "title": "Lawmaker asks if swallowed camera be used for female exam"}, "twitter": {"description": "Lawmaker asks if swallowed camera be used for female exam", "title": "Lawmaker asks if swallowed camera be used for female exam", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@salon"}, "author": "Kimberlee Kruesi", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Barbieri, who sits on the board of a crisis pregnancy center in northern Idaho, voted in favor of the legislation.\nTopics: From the Wires, NewsBOISE, Idaho (AP) \u2014 An Idaho lawmaker received a brief lesson on female anatomy after asking if a woman can swallow a small camera for doctors to conduct a remote gynecological exam.\nDr. Julie Madsen was testifying in opposition to the bill when Barbieri asked the question.\nMadsen replied that would be impossible because swallowed pills do not end up in the vagina.\nThe committee approved the bill 13-4 on a party-line vote."}
