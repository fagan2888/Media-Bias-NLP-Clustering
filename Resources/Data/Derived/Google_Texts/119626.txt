Win and Will Butler of Arcade Fire had something special planned for the halftime performance at their Pop Vs. Jock annual charity basketball game held during the Pop Montréal festival on Saturday. Recruiting Bon Iver's Justin Vernon, the Strokes' Nikolai Fraiture and Régine Chassagne, they formed the Pop All Star Band for one night only. They performed covers of songs such as The White Stripe's "Seven Nation Army" and Phil Collins' "In The Air Tonight," amongst performances and DJing by Chassagne, Kid Koala and A-Trak. Watch the videos of the Pop All Star Band below because it will never happen again.
