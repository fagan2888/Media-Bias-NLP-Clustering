WasteWin) told ICTMN.\n\nThe Sisseton-Wahpeton Dakota woman who is a professor of law at the University of Idaho College of Law knows about those past injustices. Besides growing up with stories of the U.S.-Dakota War of 1862 and its devastating aftermath for her people, she has studied the history of the trials that followed.\n\nWhen looking back across time at the largest mass execution in U.S. history, guilt or innocence for each individual cannot\u2014and need not\u2014be determined, but the judicial system itself can and should be judged, agreed EagleWoman and Carol Chomsky, a professor at University of Minnesota Law School who also researched the military commissions that handed down the verdicts.\n\nAnd the echoes of the U.S.-Dakota War and the handling of its aftermath still reverberate, EagleWoman wrote in her 2013 article published in the William Mitchell Law Review. \u201cThe quality of life for the Sisseton-Wahpeton Oyate (SWO) continues to be far below the level enjoyed by the majority of citizens in the United States\u2026 The human rights of cultural and economic self-determination, recognition of the ownership of a permanent homeland, and freedom to live in peaceful integrity have all been denied to the Sisseton-Wahpeton Dakota by the U.S. government and its component state governments.\u201d\n\nIt is hard to summarize in a few words the multiple strands of the complex web that ignited the U.S.-Dakota War in late summer of 1862 in southwestern Minnesota. Some of the story is too familiar in Indian country.\n\nA series of treaties restricted the living space of the Dakota people to an area that could no longer sustain their traditional hunting economy. Promised payments and other remittance to compensate for the concessions were slow to emerge, withheld all together, or syphoned off by unscrupulous traders and others, leaving the Dakota people with nothing to live on\u2014many facing starvation heading toward the long Minnesota winter.\n\nWith the Dakota people buffeted by the increasingly dangerous poverty and by the overt racism expressed by many of the white settlers and traders in the region (one trader infamously quipped \u201cLet them eat grass\u201d when informed of the pending starvation), it should not have been surprising when conflicts arose between the two races. The spark that would ignite the war came August 17, 1862, when four young Dakota hunters killed five settlers. In the past, wrote Carol Chomsky in her 1990 article \u201cThe United States-Dakota War Trials: A Study in Military Injustice\u201d published in the Stanford Law Review, the young men might have been turned over to the Americans, but the Dakota people were in no mood for ignoring their situation. Instead, a war council was held that evening and a decision was made to go to war, though not supported by all the Dakota leaders. Even the war leader, Taoyateduta, Little Crow, reluctantly endorsed the action.\n\n\u201cIn the 37 days of fighting, 77 American soldiers, 29 citizen-soldiers, approximately 358 settlers and an estimated 29 Dakota soldiers had been killed,\u201d Chomsky wrote.\n\nAttempts were made toward a peace, Col. Henry H. Sibley even contacted Taoyateduta, but Sibley\u2019s demand for hostages before negotiations was rejected. By late September with Dakota support waning for the war, the main war leaders left the main camp with their families and those who wished to continue fighting. The remaining leaders agreed to surrender to Sibley, who had promised punishment only for those involved in attacks on settlers. Sibley set up the ironically named Camp Release across from the camp and eventually took more than 2,000 into custody.\n\nAlmost immediately, a three-member panel was set up as a court of inquiry, Chomsky wrote, but the court became a military commission, eventually judging 392 prisoners, convicting 323, of which 20 were sentenced to prison and 303 sentenced to death.\n\nThis commission, which blazed through all 392 trials in the 42 days between September 28 and November 8, epitomized the mockery of justice for the Dakota people that essentially began with the perverting of the treaty promises.\n\n\u201cThere were a very large number of trials in a very short period of time,\u201d Chomsky said. \u201cThey were fast, they were repetitive, they focused on the same question\u2026 I think it became routine\u2026 It was a veneer of fairness, and just because there are trials does not mean there is fairness.\u201d\n\nThere were numerous violations of the judicial procedure\u2014whether public or military\u2014in the creation and procedures of the commission, the two law professors pointed out. Both question whether a military commission was legitimate in cases where the main charges were murder, rape and robbery.\n\nIn addition, all six of those appointed to the commission had fought in the war. While that may have been legal, Chomsky indicated, it raises questions about the bias of the panel. It was not legal to have Sibley convene the commission. \u201cBecause the officer who convenes a court-martial is the first to review the proceedings for error, it is important that he be free from bias or the appearance of bias,\u201d she wrote. He could not be both the accuser, as he was in these cases, and the convener of the trials.\n\nAnother point against justice being served was the basic lack of understanding by the Dakota prisoners of what they were being charged with and what the consequences of the trials might be. \u201cMost of them did not speak English,\u201d EagleWoman said. \u201cThey did not even know that they were being tried for crimes.\u201d Most also did not have counsel defending them.\n\nCultural differences likely also played a role, Chomsky believes. One example is that the Dakota prisoners themselves might have spoken with pride of touching an armed soldier, \u201ccounting coup\u201d in battle, which may have been misinterpreted as killing someone.\n\nWitnesses, who testified in multiple trials, often were themselves facing charges and possible execution. One defendant-turned-witness gave evidence in 55 cases, though he himself was later sentenced to hang (but was not among the 38).\n\n\u201cIt was a sham,\u201d EagleWoman summed up the proceedings.\n\nApparently President Abraham Lincoln also felt that potential. Since this was a military proceeding, he had the ultimate say on the punishment, and asked to review all 303 cases bound for execution. At first, he considered approving execution only for those cases where rape had been proven, but that would have reduced the number sentenced to death to only two men. He decided instead to condemn those convicted of participating in civilian massacres and approved 39 executions, later suspending the execution of one on Sibley\u2019s recommendation that new evidence brought his guilt into question.\n\nEagleWoman has a harsh assessment of Lincoln\u2019s decisions. \u201cI think he should have followed general military practice at the time. They should have been released. He made a political decision, made based on the racial hatred\u2026 Lincoln was a lawyer, knew that this was improper.\u201d\n\nThe hatred was aflame, as Chomsky reported in her article. \u201cIndeed, as the wagon train of prisoners moved through New Ulm on its way from Camp Release to Mankato, a crowd of men, women, and children pelted the shackled Dakota with bricks and other objects, seriously injuring some prisoners and guards. A mob attacked the rest of the Dakota\u2014the \u201cfriendly community\u2014on their way to Fort Snelling; one baby was snatched from its mother\u2019s arms and beaten to death.\u201d\n\nThe 38 executions, originally scheduled for December 19, were further delayed for fear of mob reactions. After a massive scaffold had been built in Mankato to hold all the condemned, though, the hangings did take place December 26. It was not until December 22, EagleWoman said, that the prisoners would told of their impending deaths. On the 23rd, the condemned men danced and sang and the next few days were permitted visits with relatives.\n\nOne of the condemned, Hdainyanka, Rattling Runner, sent an angry letter to his father-in-law expressing his feeling of being deceived into surrendering because no innocent man would be injured. \u201cI have not killed, wounded or injured a white man or any white persons\u2026 and yet today I am set apart for execution.\u201d\n\nIndeed, EagleWoman points out, the 38 executed were those who voluntarily surrendered: \u201cThey had gone there because they wanted to end the war, and they protected the whites.\u201d Those who wanted to continue the war already fled, though two war leaders, Wakanozanzan, Medicine Bottle, and Shakopee, Little Six, were later kidnapped from Canada, tried and executed in 1865.\n\nIt is believed that at least two men were executed at the mass hanging by mistake\u2014one man answered to a name \u201cChaske\u201d or \u201cfirst son\u201d that was not him and another young white man, raised by the Dakota, who had been acquitted but was hanged.\n\nMore than 4,000 people crowded the square where the hanging was done, cheering when the execution was done.\n\nA section of the Minnesota Historical Society\u2019s U.S.-Dakota War website describes what followed: \u201cAfter dangling from the scaffold for a half hour, the men\u2019s bodies were cut down and hauled to a shallow mass grave on a sandbar between Mankato\u2019s main street and the Minnesota River. Before morning, most of the bodies had been dug up and taken by physicians for use as medical cadavers.\u201d\n\nIn the days that followed, several of those earlier condemned would be given pardons when it appeared the evidence was not sufficient against them. Others would be eventually taken to a prison camp in Iowa.\n\nThe end for these men seemed to mark a beginning to renewed suffering for the Dakota people. More than one-quarter of the several thousand who surrendered to Sibley would be dead before the end of 1863. Thousands of others were exiled to the Dakotas, Montana or as far as Manitoba.\n\nTelling history as it truly happened, capturing the full complexities, doesn\u2019t only honor the past, it can help for the future, EagleWoman said. \u201cIt\u2019s traumatic, but we still have to know the truth.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Remembering the Dakota 38: A List of Those Executed in 1862", "article_metadata": {"description": "A ghost of Christmas past haunts the Dakota still\u2014the ghost of an injustice to 38 men hanged December 26, 1862.
