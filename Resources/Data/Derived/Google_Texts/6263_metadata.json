As the population ages at unprecedented rates, the demand for informal elder care will only increase. Currently, one in six American workers acts as a caregiver, and over 10,000 Baby Boomers turn 65 every day. These trends will require employers to adapt to employee caregiving as the \u201cnew normal.\u201d\n\nA recent poll from Gallup shows that unpaid caregiving responsibilities keep 24 percent of employees from working more. The National Alliance for Caregiving estimates that the cost of employee caregivers to employers due to lost productivity, including replacing employees, workday interruptions, absenteeism and shifts from full-time to part-time work, is estimated as high $34 billion annually.\n\n\u201cFamily caregivers are this invisible army that employers are slowly starting to appreciate,\u201d said Debra Whitman, Executive Vice President Policy, Strategy and International Affairs, AARP. \u201cToo many times the biggest issue for caregivers isn\u2019t just taking care of a loved one, but it\u2019s how to do that and juggle their job.\u201d\n\nIn an effort to celebrate and support working caregivers, the ReACT\u2019s new resource, Employer Resource Guide: Four Steps for Supporting Employees with Caregiving Responsibilities and new website (www.aarp.org/ReACT), which is part of AARP\u2019s online Caregiver Resource Center, will provide employers with the tools they need to open channels of communication about caregiving in the workplace, embrace caregiving as the new normal and find ways to address employees\u2019 needs for flexibility.\n\nReACT will launch these tools today at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce during a roundtable event titled \u201cSupporting Working Caregivers: An Employer Imperative.\u201d The event begins at 11:30 a.m. and is open to the media.\n\nAbout ReACT\n\nReACT is an employer-focused coalition dedicated to addressing the challenges faced by employee caregivers and reducing the impact on the companies that employ them. ReACT represents nearly 750,000 employees through its membership of more than 30 companies and non-profit organizations.
