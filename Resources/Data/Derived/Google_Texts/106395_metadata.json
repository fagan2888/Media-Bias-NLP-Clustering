Wayne\u2019s web site: ROOTforAmerica.com .\n\nFolks, we are being scammed. Democrats are winning elections through what appears to be massive voter fraud.\n\nThere is a saying, \u201cHe with the gold rules.\u201d Well, whoever wins elections has the gold. The winner has the power to change everything - so they rule. It doesn\u2019t matter if the win was by a small margin, or if the win was by committing fraud. Winning is everything.\n\nMany citizens may not realize most national elections are won by a sliver of votes in only a few, key battleground states. Change the vote totals by a small bit in a few states and Mitt Romney is the president: Ohio, Florida, Virginia, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Wisconsin, Iowa, Pennsylvania.\n\nWhy did Obama and Democrats win by just a sliver in those few battleground states? In 2012 it was a powerful one-two punch, both of which I believe were out and out voter fraud.\n\nFirst, Obama used the IRS as his personal mafia thug enforcers to persecute, intimidate and destroy his political opposition - ranging from Tea Parties, to conservative fundraising organizations, to top GOP donors, to high-profile outspoken critics in the media (like myself).\n\nThis widespread Obama-IRS conspiracy killed enthusiasm and intensity, dampened energy, silenced free speech and prevented fundraising through an IRS witch-hunt. This changed the outcome of the 2012 election and Obama should be impeached for it.\n\nIf you think impeachment can\u2019t happen, study Ukraine. One day the president is mocking protestors and sending police to kill them. The next day he is abandoning his palace, impeached by Congress, and the military is hugging the citizens in the streets. It all changes quickly.\n\nBut still, I believe the IRS scandal is the smaller problem. Impeach Obama and no president will use the IRS for political purposes ever again. Problem solved.\n\nThe more widespread problem involves Voter Identification \u2013 or the lack of it. Without Voter ID, Democrat voters across this country could be voting four times, five times, 10 times each. There is no way to prevent it and the facts indicate that is exactly what happened.\n\nTake Philadelphia as just one example. There were voting precincts in Philly where the combined vote was Obama over Romney by about 30,000 to 0. In those precincts GOP poll watchers were forcibly removed for several hours, until judges ordered them back in. During those hours were the ballot boxes stuffed? Did Democrat voters vote 10 times each? As absurd as 30,000 to 0 is (it\u2019s just statistically impossible), maybe the right vote total was 6,000 to 0.\n\nIf I\u2019m wrong, why did the wolves want the chicken coup left unguarded?\n\nDemocrats hate Voter ID. It\u2019s one of their biggest issues. But that\u2019s ridiculous. Voter ID is a no-brainer. You need an ID to do most anything: cash a check, buy cigarettes or alcohol, get food stamps, or get any government benefits. You even need ID to get into government buildings!\n\nSo why are Democrats so intense and passionate about such a minor issue? Me thinks thou protesteth too much. This is a much bigger issue than meets the naked eye. Democrats are losing their minds over Voter ID because they know they can\u2019t win elections without fraud.\n\nObama and his socialist cabal are making \u201ca mountain out of a molehill\u201d because this is their edge. This is how they win elections when their policies are a failure; when they\u2019ve ruined the economy; when they\u2019ve spent the country into bankruptcy; when they\u2019ve killed millions of jobs. Voter ID is their secret weapon. They stuff the ballot box. They cheat.\n\nI dare Democrats to prove me wrong. But of course they can\u2019t, because without Voter ID, there is no way to prove voters are voting multiple times, in different precincts, using false names, or the names of dead voters, or the names of voters who have moved, or using illegal immigrants to illegally vote across this country.\n\nBut there is proof positive Voter ID is a scam. The Obama-Democratic Party argument against Voter ID because:\n\nA) It\u2019s racist\u2026\n\nB) It\u2019s meant to stop people from voting\u2026\n\nC) It\u2019s too big a burden for poor and minority voters to obtain ID.\n\nI just returned from two doctor visits for a checkup and a follow-up test. These were my first doctor visits since Obamacare took effect. Guess what both medical offices asked me for before any doctor could see me, or any medical test could be done?\n\nOfficial government-issued photo ID.\n\nYou cannot see a doctor, or receive your free Obamacare without ID to prove it\u2019s really you. A health insurance card won\u2019t do the trick, simply because the medical office needs to prove you are in fact the person whose name is on the insurance card.\n\nI questioned the nurses at both offices. They verified no one can collect their \u201cfree\u201d Obamacare services from any doctor without showing ID. And since everyone is now required to have health insurance (or is given free insurance), the government is requiring that EVERYONE have a photo ID.\n\nDoes that make Obama and the Democrats racists? No, what it makes them is hypocrites who are in total fear of fair elections that they know they have no chance of winning \u2013 no chance, that is, unless they cheat. Don\u2019t look now but Obamacare just opened the door for Voter ID.\n\nThis is where the younger generation screams, \u201cBUSTED!\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s take the hypocrisy a step further. Every single Democrat voter must be lining up to get their photo ID so they can get their free Obamacare. So the argument that poor and minority Democrat voters don\u2019t have ID, or shouldn\u2019t be \u201cburdened\u201d to get it, is out the window.\n\nI think this is where the younger generation screams, \u201cDOUBLE BUSTED.\u201d\n\nThat leaves only one possible reason to oppose Photo ID for voters\u2026the ability to cheat! The whole Voter ID scam is dead in the water- just like the Obama economy. The argument against Voter ID is killed- just like jobs in this Obama economy. And anyone who tries to argue \u201cmost voters don\u2019t have ID\u201d is a liar- just like the president who said, \u201cIf you like your insurance, you can keep it.\u201d\n\nObama you are BUSTED.\n\nWayne\u2019s latest book is: \u201cThe Ultimate Obama Survival Guide: How to Survive, Thrive, and Prosper During Obamageddon.\u201d\n\n\u2013\n\nTheBlaze contributor channel supports an open discourse on a range of views.
