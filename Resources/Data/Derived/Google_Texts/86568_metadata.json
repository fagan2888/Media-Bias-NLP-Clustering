Using electronic health records, the researchers categorized the subjects into three groups: inactive, insufficiently active, and active. They then looked at each patient\u2019s exercise level in relation to his or her progress following initial hospitalization.\n\nThe team found that, compared to inactive subjects, COPD patients who exercised 150 minutes a week or more had a 34 percent lower risk of readmission. Notably, the reduced risk was nearly the same for patients reporting at least some exercise; even though they didn\u2019t reach 150 minutes, they still had a 33 percent lower risk of readmission within 30 days compared to sedentary patients.\n\n\"Previous research has only analyzed the relationship between physical inactivity and increased mortality rate and hospitalizations, but not 30-day readmissions in patients with COPD,\u201d Nguyen explained.\n\nCOPD and Exercise\n\nAccording to the American Lung Association, COPD is currently the third leading cause of death in America, with more than 130,000 deaths recorded annually. The condition, which is characterized by respiratory symptoms like wheezing and chest tightening, currently affects nearly 13 million U.S. adults. Up to 90 percent of COPD deaths are caused by smoking.\n\nThe new study addresses the growing need for new interventions aimed at reducing hospital readmission after discharge among patients. \u201cOur findings suggest that regular physical activity could buffer the stresses of hospitalization,\u201d Nguyen told reporters. \u201cFuture studies will focus on determining whether we can reduce hospitalizations by improving physical activity in patients with COPD.\"", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, physical activity, copd, huong nguyen", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients who get moderate to vigorous exercise reduce their risk of hospital readmission, a new study finds.", "title": "Light Exercise Keeps COPD Patients Out Of The Hospital", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/physical-activity-cuts-hospital-readmission-rates-patients-copd-275636", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/04/09/exercise.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients who get moderate to vigorous exercise reduce their risk of hospital readmission, a new study finds.", "title": "Light Exercise Keeps COPD Patients Out Of The Hospital", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/physical-activity-cuts-hospital-readmission-rates-patients-copd-275636", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/04/09/exercise.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/04/09/exercise.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Conditions", "published_time": "2014-04-09T16:00:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-04-09T16:00:58-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients who get moderate to vigorous exercise reduce their risk of hospital readmission, a new study finds."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd03ea\"", "article_summary": "\u201cFuture studies will focus on determining whether we can reduce hospitalizations by improving physical activity in patients with COPD.\"\nNew research shows that physical activity cuts hospital readmission rates for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), indicating a possible prevention strategy against the potentially life-threatening lung condition that affects millions of Americans.\n\u201cOur findings suggest that regular physical activity could buffer the stresses of hospitalization,\u201d Nguyen told reporters.\nThe team found that, compared to inactive subjects, COPD patients who exercised 150 minutes a week or more had a 34 percent lower risk of readmission.\n\"Previous research has only analyzed the relationship between physical inactivity and increased mortality rate and hospitalizations, but not 30-day readmissions in patients with COPD,\u201d Nguyen explained."}
