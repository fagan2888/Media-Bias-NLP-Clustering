The study found that people are reporting fewer symptoms of disease, less problems with daily tasks such as walking, and more energy.\n\nA 25-year-old person today can expect to live 6 percent or 2.4 quality years longer than their 1987 counterpart. Meanwhile, a 65-year-old person will gain 1.7 quality years, a 14 percent increase from a generation ago.\n\nAllison Rosen, senior author of the study, told UMassMedNow that the research \u201ctells us what the relative quality of those added years are in terms of physical, emotional and mental well-being.\u201d\n\n\u201cThough many studies have measured this in different ways, this is really the first time we\u2019ve been able to capture this type of information across the whole U.S. population over an extended period.\u201d\n\nAdvances in health care mean that many conditions are far more treatable today than 25 years ago, Rosen said.\n\nHeart disease, for example, is a far more treatable than it was a generation ago. \u201cToday, it is far less likely that a patient recovering from a heart attack will become institutionalized or need around-the-clock care the way they once might have,\u201d Rosen said.\n\nAmericans today are more likely to experience a decrease in quality of life due to chronic, degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nThe same study indicated some troubling health trends such as an increase in ailments among younger Americans stemming from a sedentary lifestyle, as well as an increase in anxiety among young and middle-aged people.\n\nWith the Affordable Care Act scheduled to go into effect in 2014, Rosen said that comprehensive, cohesive studies such as this one ensure the ability to measure the success of the government's health plan.\n\nThe ability, she said, to assess the success of the ACA will tell us whether or not we are \u201cgetting the most health bang for our bucks.\u201d\n\nAmel Ahmed contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "First of its kind report reveals improved quality of life compared to a generation ago", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.aljazeera.simple", "og": {"url": "http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2013/9/13/americans-livinglongerandhealthierlivesstudyshows.html", "image": {"width": 960, "identifier": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/articles/2013/9/13/americans-livinglongerandhealthierlivesstudyshows/jcr:content/mainpar/adaptiveimage/src.adapt.960.high.Lifespan2_091313.1379242647495.jpg", "height": 600}, "type": "article", "description": "First of its kind report reveals improved quality of life compared to a generation ago", "title": "Americans living longer and healthier lives, study shows"}, "twitter": {"site": "@AJAM", "image": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/articles/2013/9/13/americans-livinglongerandhealthierlivesstudyshows/jcr:content/mainpar/adaptiveimage/src.adapt.960.high.Lifespan2_091313.1379242647495.jpg", "description": "First of its kind report reveals improved quality of life compared to a generation ago", "card": "summary", "title": "Americans living longer and healthier lives, study shows"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=810543104, affiliate-data=10lxKx", "keywords": "Fracking, Public Health, Health Care, U.S., Health", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc561\"", "article_summary": "Americans are not just living longer lives, but healthier ones as well, according to a study published this month in the American Journal of Public Health.\nA 25-year-old person today can expect to live 6 percent or 2.4 quality years longer than their 1987 counterpart.\nAmericans today are more likely to experience a decrease in quality of life due to chronic, degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s.\nThe study found that people are reporting fewer symptoms of disease, less problems with daily tasks such as walking, and more energy.\nThe study showed that the average American can expect to live about four years longer than a person born two decades ago, thanks to advances in medicine and new drug treatments."}
