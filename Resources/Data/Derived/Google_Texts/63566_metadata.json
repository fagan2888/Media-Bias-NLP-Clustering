Whether through taking jobs or casting votes, hyper-immigration is revolutionizing the U.S.\n\nWe are a nation of immigrants, it is often reflexively said. But it is a little-known fact that our foreign-born population dropped more than 11% in the quarter century after World War II.\n\nSince 1970, however, we have become an irrational nation of hyper-immigration, as the foreign-born among us have exploded from fewer than 10 million to more than 41 million as of 2013 \u2014 a staggering 324.5% increase.\n\nPure political motivation is at the root of this ongoing revolution. The 1965 Immigration Act, pushed hard by Democrat Sen. Ted Kennedy, took effect in 1968. Speaking at the signing ceremony at the foot of the Statue of Liberty, President Johnson assured the country it was \u201cnot a revolutionary bill. It does not affect the lives of millions,\u201d and \u201cwill not reshape the structure of our daily lives.\u201d\n\nBefore that act, as Johnson pointed out, \u201conly three countries were allowed to supply 70% of all the immigrants.\u201d\n\nA new analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service for the Senate Judiciary Committee finds that during this hyper-immigration, incomes of the bottom 90% of Americans flat-lined, then dropped starting in 2000. By comparison, middle-class wages increased between 1945 and 1970.\n\nLast year, Karen Zeigler and Steven Camarota of the Center for Immigration Studies found that, according to federal government data, \u201csince 2000 all of the net gain in the number of working-age (16 to 65) people holding a job has gone to immigrants (legal and illegal).\u201d\n\nAnd the politics behind all this continues. Homeland Security Department sources tell PJ Media\u2019s J. Christian Adams that the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services is \u201csending letters to all 9 million green card holders urging them to naturalize prior to the 2016 election.\u201d\n\nOn top of that, as the Washington Times\u2019 Stephen Dinan reported last week, deportations of illegals \u201chave plummeted by another 25% so far this year,\u201d with just 117,181 immigrants deported in the six months since October.\n\nAs a landmark report from Phyllis Schlafly\u2019s Eagle Forum last year concluded, the annual flow of 1.1 million legal immigrants under the current system means more than 5 million new potential voters by 2024, and more than 8 million by 2028.\n\nSince most who vote support Democrats, \u201cthe influx of these new voters would reduce or eliminate Republicans\u2019 ability to offer an alternative to big government, to increased government spending, to higher taxes, and to favorite liberal policies such as ObamaCare and gun control,\u201d Schlafly has warned.\n\nShe further argues that \u201cthere is nothing controversial about the report\u2019s conclusion that both Hispanics and Asians, who account for about three-fourths of today\u2019s immigrants, generally agree with the Democrats\u2019 big-government agenda,\u201d and therefore \u201cvote two-to-one for Democrats.\u201d\n\nAs Cuban-American GOP Sen. Marco Rubio finds that his recognition of the threat of hyper-immigration has helped propel him to the head of the party\u2019s presidential pack, Republicans now have new political ammo: a government report confirming that for 50 years the huddled masses have been trampling the middle class.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Change: A new congressional study suggests that massive immigration increases in recent decades have hammered middle-class wages.
