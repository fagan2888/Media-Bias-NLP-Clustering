At one point, Thomas received an IV.\n\n\u201cYou have to fight through it, next man up and try to get out there as quickly as possible,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Chargers used an old, familiar combo \u2014 Philip Rivers to Antonio Gates \u2014 to upset the defending Super Bowl champion Seahawks.\n\nGates had three touchdown catches, including a spectacular, one-handed grab, and the Chargers controlled the tempo to keep Russell Wilson and Marshawn Lynch off the field to beat the Seahawks 30-21 victory Sunday.\n\nThe 34-year-old Gates scored on catches of 8, 8 and 21 yards.\n\nThe 21-yarder was epic, as the star tight end split two defenders and extended for Rivers\u2019 pass, reaching out with his left hand to gather it in. Flat on his back in the end zone, he held up the ball to show the referee he\u2019d made the catch that gave San Diego a 27-14 lead late in the third quarter.\n\nThe three touchdown receptions tied Gates\u2019 career high. Rivers was 28 of 37 for 284 yards.\n\nSeattle was efficient when it had the ball, but it just didn\u2019t have it enough as the Chargers dominated time of possession on a steamy afternoon at Qualcomm Stadium.\n\n\u201cThey had twice as many plays as we did today,\u201d coach Pete Carroll said. \u201cIt was a great job by Philip and their offense. Antonio Gates was phenomenal today. They were moving it like crazy and they just kept the ball away from us.\u201d\n\nSan Diego (1-1) had blown an 11-point, fourth-quarter lead and lost its opener Monday night at Arizona. Seattle (1-1) had nine days to prepare after an impressive 20-point opening victory against Green Bay.\n\nAfter Gates\u2019 third scoring catch, Wilson moved the Seahawks 70 yards, capping the drive with a 14-yard touchdown throw to Marshawn Lynch to pull to 27-21.\n\nSeattle turned the ball over on downs on its 10 in the closing minutes and San Diego\u2019s Nick Novak kicked his third field goal, from 28 yards, with 16 seconds left.\n\nSan Diego used long drives all day to control play and wear out Seattle\u2019s vaunted defense.\n\n\u201cIt was hot today, but they were playing in it, also,\u201d Carroll said. \u201cUnfortunately, the game wasn\u2019t balanced out. We had a ton of plays on defense that wears them down, too. It was a factor in the game, but I don\u2019t think that was the deciding factor in this football game.\u201d\n\nPercy Harvin gave the Chargers a big gift when he fumbled the kickoff at the 28 after Novak\u2019s 43-yard field goal gave the Chargers a 13-7 lead with 4:40 to go before halftime.\n\nAfter consecutive 10-yard penalties gave the Chargers a first-and-goal from the 23, Rivers completed a 15-yard screen pass to Eddie Royal before evading pressure and hitting Gates for their second scoring hookup of the quarter.\n\nWilson wasted no time in leading the Seahawks 61 yards in five plays, hitting Robert Turbin on a 3-yard TD pass to pull to 20-14. Turbin also had a 32-yard catch and a 10-yard run on the drive.\n\nSan Diego running back Ryan Mathews was carted off the field with an apparent right knee injury early in the fourth quarter.\n\nRivers hit Gates on an 8-yard TD pass early in the second quarter.\n\nDwight Freeney sacked Wilson to force the Seahawks to punt on their first drive. Novak kicked a 50-yard field goal for San Diego.\n\nThe Seahawks came back with a three-play, 60-yard drive capped when Harvin took a pitch from Wilson, got the edge and ran 51 yards down the left sideline for a 7-3 lead. But Harvin had stepped on the sideline during the run and the NFL said after the game the score was \u201cincorrectly confirmed.\u201d The league said the ball should have been spotted at the 21-yard line.\n\n___\n\nOnline: AP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Antonio Gates\u2019 3 TDs carry Chargers to win over Seahawks", "title": "Antonio Gates\u2019 3 TDs carry Chargers to win over Seahawks", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/14/antonio-gates-3-tds-carry-chargers-to-win-over-seahawks/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140914__gatesp1.jpg", "height": 428}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140914__gatesp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-14T17:24:07+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T05:25:12+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde651\"", "article_summary": "SAN DIEGO \u2014 The San Diego Chargers didn\u2019t need a 12th man against the Seattle Seahawks.\nThe Chargers used an old, familiar combo \u2014 Philip Rivers to Antonio Gates \u2014 to upset the defending Super Bowl champion Seahawks.\nSan Diego used long drives all day to control play and wear out Seattle\u2019s vaunted defense.\nSan Diego running back Ryan Mathews was carted off the field with an apparent right knee injury early in the fourth quarter.\nNovak kicked a 50-yard field goal for San Diego."}
