Wolfe appeared to give Harris a late shove prompting some pushing back-and-forth, but no punches were thrown.\n\nLater on, Wolfe got physical again with another offensive lineman before being calmed down by quarterback Peyton Manning.\n\n\u201cIt was a good start with our pads,\u201d coach Gary Kubiak said. \u201cIt\u2019s what it ought to look like if you\u2019re a good team.\u201d\n\nKubiak said quarterback Brock Osweiler will run with the starting group Monday to give Manning a break.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important that (Osweiler) walks out of that locker room and it\u2019s his team for the day,\u201d Kubiak said. \u201cIf his feet improve, he\u2019ll be a better player, and it\u2019s something I\u2019m staying on him about.\u201d\n\nReceiver Jordan Taylor is quickly becoming a camp standout. He had another good practice Sunday, highlighted by a terrific sideline grab.\n\nKubiak made a point to the team to end practices better. He said the team tends to lose focus when they tire toward the end.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t make those plays in a game when you\u2019re worn out in the fourth quarter, it\u2019s going to be tough on you,\u201d Kubiak said. \u201cI want them to feel it, not just me.\u201d\n\nThe 3,786 fans in attendance got a treat from the linebackers early on. A cat-and-mouse drill in front of the hill of fans drew a chorus of cheers when DeMarcus Ware was turned loose to chase Von Miller.\n\nAfter practice, Kubiak praised Miller embracing a leadership role on and off the field.\n\nMore cheers erupted when Manning unleashed a deep rocket pass to Emmanuel Sanders for a touchdown during 11-on-11 drills. Manning spent his series off throwing balls to kids in the stands, stealing most of the eyes away from ongoing second-team snaps.\n\nReceiver Demaryius Thomas started practice off sluggish with a couple of early drops. But by the end, he knocked off a bit of the rust with three catches in team drills.\n\nThe 1986 Denver Broncos mascot Michael Hancock showed up to camp. But now he\u2019s more known for being Denver\u2019s mayor.\n\nThe lifelong Broncos fan served a stint as \u201cHuddles\u201d when he was 17 years old and still considers it one of the crowning moments of his life.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to be the mayor today,\u201d Hancock said. \u201cGrowing up we used to go up to Greeley every year and it\u2019s a lot different now.\u201d\n\nMayor Hancock said the Broncos look more focused than in recent years, and he expects an impressive season.\n\nInjury updates. Tight end Marcel Jensen was unable to practice Sunday after experiencing soreness from being stepped on Saturday. Kubiak said he expects him to return to practice Monday.\n\nDefensive end Malik Jackson (calf) and running back Jeremy Stewart (hamstring) were limited in practice.\n\nOffensive tackle Connor Rains (foot) missed his second straight day of practice.\n\nAnd veteran defensive Antonio Smith, who missed Saturday\u2019s workouts for a funeral, returned to resume his work with trainers and limited participation in drills.\n\nCameron Wolfe: 303-954-1891, cwolfe@denverpost.com or twitter.com/CameronWolfe", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Broncos bring the intensity on Day 3 of training camp", "title": "Broncos bring the intensity on Day 3 of training camp", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/08/02/broncos-bring-the-intensity-on-day-3-of-training-camp/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150802__trainingcampday3p1.jpg", "height": 450}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150802__trainingcampday3p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-02T10:54:04+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T05:58:23+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Sunday brought an uptick of intensity to the Broncos\u2019 training camp .\nHe had another good practice Sunday, highlighted by a terrific sideline grab.\nAfter practice, Kubiak praised Miller embracing a leadership role on and off the field.\nThe 1986 Denver Broncos mascot Michael Hancock showed up to camp.\nOn the eve of the first padded practice of training camp, the first \u201cfight\u201d broke out between defensive end Derek Wolfe and offensive tackle Ryan Harris."}
