Yet, the Obamacare legislation is completely silent as to whether state taxpayers must pony up to pay for Obamacare or risk losing necessary Medicaid and CHIP funds. The federal government contrived this new scheme, and the states were recently required to pay.\n\nIt represents coercion, which the U.S. Supreme Court ruled was not allowed in the first Obamacare decision,NFIB v. Sebelius. In that ruling, the Supreme Court held that threatening a percentage of a state\u2019s budget unless it agreed to expand Medicaid was coercion. This same funding is at risk again if states refuse to pay the tax.\n\nIt delegated the duties of Congress to a private entity, which violates the delegation doctrine prohibiting private entities from exercising legislative authority.\n\nThe new regulation represents a tax on the states, so it violates the constitutional doctrine prohibiting the taxation of a sovereign state.\n\nThe fee applies to private insurers, but Paxton said it eats into public budgets since states reimburse private firms under Medicaid.\n\nTexas has been part of numerous lawsuits aiming to dismantle the contentious federal health care law, commonly known as \u201cObamacare.\u201d The health care law has twice been upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nClick here to see the complaint filed in federal court.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Affordable Care Act", "description": "The Republican argues a fee in the Affordable Care Act is an", "programs": "none", "og": {"site_name": "Houston Public Media", "description": "The Republican argues a fee in the Affordable Care Act is an", "title": "Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton Sues The Feds Over Obamacare | Houston Public Media", "url": "https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/2015/10/22/127024/texas-attorney-general-ken-paxton-sues-the-feds-over-obamacare/", "image": {"url": "https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/22142800/120705_aca.jpg", "identifier": "https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/22142800/120705_aca.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "story_id": 474424146, "twitter": {"description": "The Republican argues a fee in the Affordable Care Act is an", "title": "Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton Sues The Feds Over Obamacare", "url": "https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/2015/10/22/127024/texas-attorney-general-ken-paxton-sues-the-feds-over-obamacare/", "image": "https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/22142800/120705_aca.jpg", "creator": "@houstonpubmedia", "site": "@houstonpubmedia", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "HPM News Staff", "wordCount": 329, "org_id": 220, "datePublished": "2015-10-22T09:28:00+00:00", "fb": {"admins": 37511993, "app_id": 1520489194943572, "pages": 27589213702}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "article": {"section": "News", "tag": "obamacare", "published_time": "2015-10-22T09:28:00+00:00"}, "keywords": "Affordable Care Act, News, affordable care, austin, health care, news, obamacare", "google-site-verification": "QOrBnMZ1LXDA9tL3e5WmFUU-oI3JUbDRotOWST1P_Dg", "has_audio": 0, "bitly-verification": "7777946f1a0a"}, "article_summary": "Texas has been part of numerous lawsuits aiming to dismantle the contentious federal health care law, commonly known as \u201cObamacare.\u201d The health care law has twice been upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court.\nThe fee applies to private insurers, but Paxton said it eats into public budgets since states reimburse private firms under Medicaid.\nYet, the Obamacare legislation is completely silent as to whether state taxpayers must pony up to pay for Obamacare or risk losing necessary Medicaid and CHIP funds.\nIt represents coercion, which the U.S. Supreme Court ruled was not allowed in the first Obamacare decision,NFIB v.
