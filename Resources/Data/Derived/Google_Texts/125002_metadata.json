Additional funding was provided through the generosity of Adelaide Gomer.]\n\n\u201cThe Gulf of Guinea is the most insecure waterway, globally,\u201d says Loic Moudouma. And he should know. Trained at the U.S. Naval War College, the lead maritime security expert of the Economic Community of Central African States, and a Gabonese Navy commander, his focus has been piracy and maritime crime in the region for the better part of a decade.\n\nMoudouma is hardly alone in his assessment.\n\nFrom 2012 to 2013, the U.S. Office of Naval Intelligence found a 25% jump in incidents, including vessels being fired upon, boarded, and hijacked, in the Gulf of Guinea, a vast maritime zone that curves along the west coast of Africa from Gabon to Liberia. Kidnappings are up, too. Earlier this year, Stephen Starr, writing for the CTC Sentinel, the official publication of the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point, asserted that, in 2014, the number of attacks would rise again.\n\nToday, what most Americans know about piracy likely centers on an attraction at Walt Disney World and the Johnny Depp movies it inspired. If the Gulf of Guinea rings any bells at all, it\u2019s probably because of the Ebola outbreak in, and upcoming U.S. military \u201csurge\u201d into, Liberia, the nation on the northern edge of that body of water. But for those in the know, the Gulf itself is an intractable hotspot on a vast continent filled with them and yet another area where U.S. military efforts have fallen short.\n\nA recent investigation by the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO)found that \u201cpiracy and maritime crime in the Gulf of Guinea has escalated\u201d and that \u201carmed robbery at sea, oil theft, and kidnapping is a persistent problem that continues to contribute to instability\u201d there. Not only that, but as Pottengal Mukundan, the director of the International Maritime Bureau of the International Chamber of Commerce, recently noted, piracy in the Gulf has taken on a particularly violent character.\n\nWhat Benjamin Benson, media chief for U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM), thinks isn\u2019t quite so clear. As the situation in the Gulf of Guinea was worsening, he touted it as an American \u201csuccess\u201d story, pure and simple. Then he claimed that he hadn\u2019t done so, after which he clammed up completely. What he thinks today is anyone\u2019s guess. He now refuses to say a word about it.\n\nLoic Moudouma, for his part, claims to see progress in bringing security to a body of water nearly the size of the Gulf of Mexico that is critical to the economies of a dozen nations. He also credits the United States for its support of security efforts there, even if they have paradoxically occurred alongside an increase in both piracy and insecurity. West African states, says Moudouma, have left waterways ungoverned, turning them into breeding grounds for criminal activity. The problem, he insists, is the poor leadership of the African nations in the region, America\u2019s \u201cpartners\u201d on the frontlines of the fight. Their lust for power, according to Moudouma, has put the national security of numerous African nations and the economic well-being of the region at risk, yet the Obama administration only recently feted the area\u2019s most corrupt strongman and the U.S. military regularly partners with his armed forces.\n\nThe Sweet Smell of Success\n\n\u201cDo not put words in my mouth. I did not say the Gulf of Guinea was a success. I did not say Gulf of Guinea maritime security was a success.\u201d This was AFRICOM spokesman Benson\u2019s response last November when I asked if he wanted to amend his earlier assessment of the Gulf of Guinea shortly after pirates kidnapped two Americans from a U.S.-flagged ship there.\n\nI was taken aback.\n\nI remembered him touting the region as a triumph when we talked in the spring of 2013, so I went back to a recording of our conversation. \u201cI\u2019m wondering what you think the big success stories are,\u201d I had asked about AFRICOM\u2019s work on the continent. \u201cThere\u2019s actually two success stories,\u201d he replied, telling me first about American efforts in Somalia. \u201cAnother area that\u2019s definitely a success is the Gulf of Guinea,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working with a number of different states developing\u2026 maritime security capabilities.\u201d\n\nI listened to that passage several times. It sure sounded like he was calling the Gulf of Guinea a success.\n\nFor almost a year since then, Benson has failed to amend, clarify, or defend his statement. He has ignored repeated requests for further information, refusing even to issue a pro forma \u201cno comment.\u201d He may still claim that he never uttered those words or he may still believe the Gulf has been an American success story, but even his boss, AFRICOM commander General David Rodriguez, in testimony before the House Armed Services Committee earlier this year, said \u201cmaritime criminal activities in the Gulf of Guinea remain at concerning levels.\u201d\n\nClick here to see a larger version\n\n\n\nAnalysis of Office of Naval Intelligence data by the Government Accountability Office from \u201cOngoing U.S. Counter-piracy Efforts Would Benefit From Agency Assessments\u201d (GAO 14-422).\n\nAmerica\u2019s Battle Against Pirates\n\nThe United States has been fighting African pirates since the early days of the republic \u2014 battles so formative that, among other things, they established along-standing pattern of dealing with foreign policy problems through armed interventions and also inspired the iconic phrase \u201cthe shores of Tripoli\u201d in theMarine Corps hymn. By the late 2000s, American ships were once againunder attack off an African coastline and the U.S. military had again been dispatched to kill pirates. This time around, the conflict centered on the Horn of Africa \u2014 not North Africa \u2014 specifically the waters off the coast of Somalia.\n\nIn the 1990s, Somalia descended into a maelstrom of violence, which hasabated somewhat in recent years but continues to plague that nation and has since spread beyond its borders. In 1993, when American troops infamously arrived in its capital, Mogadishu, in support of a United Nations humanitarian mission, they suffered 18 killed and two helicopters shot out of the sky in the \u201cBlack Hawk Down\u201d disaster. Somalia was then repeatedly battered as Islamic militants struggled for control against U.S.-backed militias and various African armed forces. During those years, neighboring nations began illegally fishing in Somali waters, prompting local fishermen to arm themselves and collect \u201ctaxes\u201d from foreign vessels. Some of these proto-pirates soon began hijacking relief food shipments, while others moved on toattacking merchant vessels and oil tankers. By 2008, Somali swashbucklers were, by some estimates, raking in as much as $150 million annually.\n\nThat same year, the U.S. National Security Council (NSC) developed a document it called \u201cCountering Piracy off the Horn of Africa: Partnership and Action Plan.\u201d Its focus was the prevention and disruption of maritime crime off the coast of Somalia. Despite this, the number of reported attacks in the region nearly doubled between 2008 and 2009, and the next year the GAO weighed in with recommendations for the NSC to \u201creassess and update its Action Plan; identify metrics; assess the costs, benefits, and effectiveness of U.S. counter-piracy activities; and clarify agency roles and responsibilities.\u201d For the next four years, however, the NSC failed to respond.\n\nIn those years, the United Nations also passednumerous resolutions related to maritime crime in the Horn of Africa, authorizing international militaries to conduct counter-piracy efforts. Naval patrols and other missions by NATO and the European Union as well as Australia, Bahrain, Canada, France, Jordan, South Korea, the Netherlands, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Spain, Thailand, Turkey, China, Russia, Japan, India, and the U.S. \u2014 in addition to the use of armed mercenaries to protect ships and a slew of new policies designed to thwart attacks \u2014 have had a demonstrable effect. According to the International Maritime Bureau, piracy incidents in the Horn of Africadeclined from 219 in 2010 to just 15 in 2013.\n\n\u201cAt the peak point of operations, up to 30 vessels from as many as 22 nations were engaged in counter-piracy operations in the region,\u201d Rear Admiral Joseph Kuzmick told Congress last year. \u201cInternational naval forces have thwarted pirate attacks in progress, engaged pirate skiffs, and successfully taken back hijacked ships during opposed boardings.\u201d While a truly international effort, the battle against the Somali pirates ranks as one of the few true bright spots for the U.S. military in Africa.\n\nOver these same years, the U.S. has also been pouring money and effort into maritime security activities on the other side of the continent with drastically different results.\n\nClick here to see a larger version\n\n\n\nGULF OF GUINEA (April 2, 2014) \u2013 U.S. Sailors, U.S. Coast Guardsmen, and Ghanaian maritime specialists, ride in a rigid-hull inflatable boat as part of a U.S.-Ghana combined maritime law enforcement operation under the African Maritime Law Enforcement Partnership program.
