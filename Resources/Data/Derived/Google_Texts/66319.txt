NEWTOWN >> Following ratification of the tentative agreement last week by the Marple Newtown Education Association, the Marple Newtown School Board voted unanimously Tuesday night to approve the new contract. The agreement, signed following the Nov. 9 negotiating session, is for the period July 1, 2015-June 30, 2018.

The teachers inked a two-year agreement in June 2013 which expired June 30. The union, members of the school board and administration and a mediator began contract negotiations in January 2015. Despite the situation, the 299 union members continued their in-class and extra-curricular activities without interruption.

According to the terms, the new money added to the salary schedule is 2.45 percent for 2015-2016, 2.4 percent for 2016-2017 and 2.21 percent for 2017-2018. Most employees will receive annual increases close to those percentages. In 2015-2016 all union members will move up one step on the salary schedule and remain on that step for the next two years. The teacher year will continue as 191 days this year and next, moving to 192 days for 2017-2018.

Changes were also made in health care coverage. The district will maintain the present Blue Cross 20-30-70 plan and its participation in the Delaware County Public Schools Healthcare Trust. The district will continue to pay 90 percent of the premium for 2015-2016, reducing to 89 percent in 2016-2017 and 88 percent in 2017-2018. Prescription plan co-pays will remain at $10 generic/$40 brand for up to a 30-day supply. If the cost of the medical benefits coverage exceeds the thresholds set by the Affordable Care Act triggering the “Cadillac Tax,” all employees will move to the next-richest plan as defined by the plans offered by the health care trust.

Changes were also made limiting up to two evening parent-teacher conferences to be scheduled beginning in the 2016-2017 school year and granting teachers an early-dismissal day equal to the length of the conference. Effective July 1, 2016, child-rearing leave will be granted for a period not to exceed two semesters. The current leave is four semesters. Supplemental contracts will increase 2 percent in 2016-2017 and 2017-2018. Teachers may advance only one horizontal column per year in recognition of educational attainment.

Chief negotiator Dennis Andrews, the high school science department leader and honors physics teacher, spoke on behalf of the negotiating team.

“It was difficult to get to the compromise agreement, but the MNEA team is happy with the outcome and that our members approved it overwhelmingly,” he said. “It shows their support for the negotiating team and the agreement.”

Board President Kathy Chandless, one of four individuals representing the district, expressed her thoughts after the vote.

“Thank you to the MNEA negotiating team and to the board for approving the agreement,” she said.
