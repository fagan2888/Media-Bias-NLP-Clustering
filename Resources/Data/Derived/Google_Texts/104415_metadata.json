She said one man had told her when she was first lady that when he tried to get health insurance for his two daughters with cystic fibrosis, he had been told by an insurance company that his company didn\u2019t insure burning houses.\n\nShe praised Arkansas\u2019 private option, the program that uses federal Medicaid dollars to purchase private health insurance for adults with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty level. She also praised former Governor Mike Beebe, under whom the private option was created, and Gov. Asa Hutchinson, who supports keeping but changing the program to a version he is calling Arkansas Works. She said the two \u201chave been among the most creative leaders in the country to figure out how to expand Medicaid in Arkansas.\u201d\n\nIn a speech heavy on policy, Clinton contrasted her husband\u2019s administration, which she said had \u201ccreated 23 million new jobs,\u201d with Republicans, who she said are \u201cselling the same snake oil, trickle down economics\u201d that she said had led to the Great Recession in the late 2000s. She said President Obama doesn\u2019t get the credit he deserves for responding to the economic crisis and criticized Republicans for saying it was a slow recovery.\n\n\u201cThat does take a lot of nerve because we would not have needed a recovery if we hadn\u2019t been dumped in the ditch in the first place by the failed policies of a Republican administration,\u201d she said.\n\nClinton said her administration would partner with state and local governments and businesses to create infrastructure jobs \u2013 including producing half a billion solar panels by the end of her first term and enough solar panels to power every American home by the end of her second term.\n\nClinton chided Republicans for their skepticism on climate change, saying they needed to talk to scientists at UAPB about the issue. Clean energy represents an opportunity for economic growth, she said. \u201cI have concluded that the Republican candidates for president don\u2019t really believe what they\u2019re saying,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are saying what they\u2019re told to say by the Koch brothers.\u201d\n\nShe said she favored raising the federal minimum wage, adding, \u201cIf you work full-time in America, you should not end up at the end of the year still in poverty.\u201d\n\nShe promised students would not have to go into debt to get a college education, suggesting they could work 10 hours a week to defray the costs and saying loan repayment periods should last no more than 20 years. However, she said that, unlike her opponent in the Democratic primary, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, she did not believe that college should be free for everyone.\n\n\u201cI do not want you to pay to send Donald Trump\u2019s youngest child for free to college,\u201d she said.\n\nShe criticized Trump for his statements about preventing Muslims from entering the United States. She said she would not send American ground troops to Syria and Iraq to fight ISIS but would work with coalition partners in the area, who are necessary in the effort.\n\n\u201cSo when the leading Republican candidate in his long line of insulting all kind of people insults Islam, insults Muslim-Americans, that makes the job harder,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not only offensive. It\u2019s dangerous.\u201d\n\nShe criticized Republican policies that she said reduced voting rights, and she said the Supreme Court\u2019s Citizens United ruling on campaign finance should be reversed. \u201cI would appoint Supreme Court justices who cared more about a person\u2019s right to vote than a billionaire\u2019s right to buy an election,\u201d she said.\n\nShe said she supported President Obama\u2019s right to nominate a Supreme Court justice to fill the vacancy left by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia.\n\n\u201cIt is just beyond my comprehension that the United States Senate, which has a constitutional responsibility to act on a nomination, is basically saying, \u2018No, we won\u2019t even consider it. We won\u2019t even look at it,\u2019\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Local & Regional News", "description": "Ahead of Super Tuesday and fresh off a resounding victory in South Carolina, Hillary Clinton told a supportive crowd of 1,000 at the University of Arkansas", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://ualrpublicradio.org/post/pine-bluff-hillary-clinton-says-she-s-running-dismantle-barriers", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/kuar/files/styles/medium/public/201602/2016-02-28-Hillary1-KATV.png", "type": "article", "description": "Ahead of Super Tuesday and fresh off a resounding victory in South Carolina, Hillary Clinton told a supportive crowd of 1,000 at the University of Arkansas", "title": "In Pine Bluff, Hillary Clinton Says She\u2019s Running To Dismantle Barriers"}, "story_id": 468510632, "twitter": {"site": "@kuarpublicradio", "card": "summary", "creator": "@kuarpublicradio"}, "author": "Steve Brawner / Talk Business & Politics", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "In Pine Bluff, Hillary Clinton Says She\u2019s Running To Dismantle Barriers"}, "nid": 55478, "datePublished": "2016-02-28", "keywords": "Arkansas Elections, Arkansas Politics", "wordCount": 1035, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe083f\"", "article_summary": "Ahead of Super Tuesday and fresh off a resounding victory in South Carolina, Hillary Clinton told a supportive crowd of 1,000 at the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff Sunday that she is running for president to dismantle barriers.\nClinton chided Republicans for their skepticism on climate change, saying they needed to talk to scientists at UAPB about the issue.\nShe said she supported President Obama\u2019s right to nominate a Supreme Court justice to fill the vacancy left by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia.\n\u201cI have concluded that the Republican candidates for president don\u2019t really believe what they\u2019re saying,\u201d she said.\n\u201cWe will all do better when we\u2019re in this together, when everybody feels like the future can be theirs,\u201d she said."}
