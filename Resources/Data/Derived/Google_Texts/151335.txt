Kristiana and Kristian Jackson-Rushford were born an entire three months early weighing 2.2 pounds each. Thankfully, we live in an age where premature babies are not nearly as much at risk as they would’ve been even 20 years ago. After the preemie twins were born on Jan. 4, proud parents Anthea and Glen couldn’t help but notice the unshakeable bond they developed as evidenced by the pair holding hands shortly after delivery.

“Both my angels holding hands again as if they were born to,” Jackson-Rushford wrote on her Facebook page. “Amazing sight!”

In the video above, you can see Glen holding Kristiana and Kristian against his bare chest. This technique, dubbed “Kangaroo Care,” promotes skin-to-skin contact, which in turn stabilizes temperature, heart rate, and breathing. Kangaroo care is often recommended as a method parents can use to prevent some of the physical and mental complications that are often associated with premature births.

According to the March of Dimes, premature births are down compared to the past, but still remain a major public health concern. One out of every 10 babies in the U.S. is born prematurely — at 37 weeks of gestation or earlier. Children born prematurely run the risk of suffering from long-term health problems as they age, including sleep apnea, heart and metabolism problems, and autism.
