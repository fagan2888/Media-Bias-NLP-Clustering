Kwanzaa, celebrated exclusively by white liberals, is a fake holiday invented in 1966 by black radical/FBI stooge Ron Everett -- aka Dr. Maulana Karenga, founder of United Slaves, the violent nationalist rival to the Black Panthers. In the annals of the American '60s, Karenga was the Father Gapon, stooge of the czarist police.\n\nIn what was ultimately a foolish gambit, during the madness of the '60s, the FBI encouraged the most extreme black nationalist organizations in order to discredit and split the left. The more preposterous the group, the better. By that criterion, Karenga's United Slaves was perfect.\n\nDespite modern perceptions that blend all the black activists of the '60s, the Black Panthers did not hate whites. Although some of their most high-profile leaders were drug dealers and murderers, they did not seek armed revolution.\n\nThose were the precepts of Karenga's United Slaves. The United Slaves were proto-fascists, walking around in dashikis, gunning down Black Panthers and adopting invented \"African\" names.\n\nAnd hasn't that been a huge help to the black community?\n\nIt's as if David Duke invented a holiday called \"Anglika,\" which he based on the philosophy of \"Mein Kampf\" -- and clueless public school teachers began celebrating the made-up, racist holiday.\n\nWhether Karenga was a willing FBI dupe, or just a dupe, remains unclear.\n\nIn the category of the-gentleman-doth-protest-too-much, back in the '70s, Karenga was quick to criticize Nigerian newspapers that claimed that certain American black radicals were CIA operatives. Karenga publicly denounced the idea, saying, \"Africans must stop generalizing about the loyalties and motives of Afro-Americans, including the widespread suspicion of black Americans being CIA agents.\"\n\nIn a 1995 interview with Ethnic NewsWatch, Karenga matter-of-factly explained that the forces out to get O.J. Simpson for the \"framed\" murder of two whites included: \"the FBI, the CIA, the State Department, Interpol, the Chicago Police Department\" and so on. Karenga should know about FBI infiltration. (He further noted that the evidence against O.J. did not \"eliminate unreasonable doubt\" -- an interesting standard of proof.)\n\nNow we know: The FBI fueled the bloody rivalry between the Panthers and United Slaves. In one barbarous outburst, Karenga's United Slaves shot two Black Panthers to death on the UCLA campus: Al \"Bunchy\" Carter and John Huggins. Karenga himself served time, a useful stepping-stone for his current position as a black studies professor at California State University at Long Beach.\n\n(Speaking of which, Rep. Paul Ryan certainly is right about what a fantastic job his mentor Jack Kemp did reaching out to all those \"socially conservative\" minorities. Look at how California has swung decisively to the right since Kemp started all that outreach stuff. Good luck winning California now, Democrats!)\n\nBack to the esteemed Cal State professor: Karenga's invented holiday is a nutty blend of schmaltzy '60s rhetoric, black racism and Marxism. The seven principles of Kwanzaa are the very same seven principles of the Symbionese Liberation Army, another invention of the Worst Generation.\n\nIn 1974, Patty Hearst, kidnap victim-cum-SLA revolutionary, posed next to the banner of her alleged captors, a seven-headed cobra. Each snakehead stood for one of the SLA's revolutionary principles: Umoja, Kujichagulia, Ujima, Ujamaa, Nia, Kuumba and Imani. These are the exact same seven \"principles\" of Kwanzaa. And here's something interesting: Kawaida, Kwanzaa and Kuumba are also the only three Kardashian sisters not to have their own shows on the E! Network.\n\nKwanzaa praises collectivism in every possible area of life -- economics, work, personality, even litter removal. (\"Kuumba: Everyone should strive to improve the community and make it more beautiful.\") It takes a village to raise a police snitch. When Karenga was asked to distinguish Kawaida, the philosophy underlying Kwanzaa, from \"classical Marxism,\" he essentially said that, under Kawaida, we also hate whites.\n\nWhile taking the \"best of early Chinese and Cuban socialism\" -- excluding, one hopes, mass murder, forced abortions, imprisonment of homosexuals and forced labor -- Karenga said Kawaida practitioners believe one's racial identity \"determines life conditions, life chances and self-understanding.\"\n\nThere's an inclusive philosophy for you!\n\nKwanzaa was the result of a '60s psychosis grafted onto the black community with the tacit encouragement of the FBI. Liberals have become so mesmerized by multicultural gibberish that they have forgotten the real history of Kwanzaa and Karenga's United Slaves -- the violence, the Marxism, the insanity.\n\nMost absurdly, for leftists anyway, they have forgotten the FBI's tacit encouragement of this murderous black nationalist cult founded by the father of Kwanzaa.\n\nKwanzaa emerged not from Africa, but from the FBI's COINTELPRO.\n\nSing to \"Jingle Bells\":\n\nKwanzaa bells, dashikis sell\n\nWhitey has to pay;\n\nBurning, shooting, oh what fun\n\nOn this made-up holiday!\n\nOnly white liberals take Kwanzaa seriously. American Blacks celebrate Christmas.
