An Oklahoma City man was arrested after police say he strangled and punched his girlfriend early Thursday morning.

Officers responded to the incident just after 2:30 a.m. at the Sunset Inn, located at 8315 S. I-35 Service Road.

The victim told police that she had gotten into an argument with her boyfriend, 48-year-old Tommy Dwayne Cross, and Cross began strangling her.

The victim said she attempted to get away from Cross. That's when Cross punched her and knocked her back into a mirror, causing the glass to shatter and cut her chin.

The victim told police she and Cross have been together for more than seven years and they have a child together.

Cross was taken into custody on one count of domestic assault and battery by strangulation.
