It would be smart, healthy and hypoallergenic. It would have the yap bred out and longevity bred in. And, most important, it would never lose its puppy face.\n\nEnter the \u201ccava-poo-chon.\u201d The breed is the newest and latest in the decades-old search for the dog-face fountain of youth and perfect pet accessory. But the American Kennel Club does not recognize the new trend as an official breed, and one expert calls some specially bred small dogs expensive \u201cgimmicks.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always been a market for these forever-ish young dogs,\u201d said veteran trainer Steve Haynes of Fidelio Dog Works in Austin who is working with 50 first-generation cava-poo-chons. \u201cUntil recently, specialized dogs like miniature Yorkies and miniature Maltese were the go-to dogs.\u201d\n\nThe cava-poo-chon is a cavalier King Charles spaniel and bichon frise mix bred with a miniature poodle. With the help of a geneticist and reproductive veterinarian, the tribrid or \u201ctriple cross\u201d was created by Linda and Steve Rogers of Timshell Farm in Pine, Ariz.\n\nWith a price tag ranging from $2,000 to $3,500, the cava-poo-chon combines the best of the three breeds, Linda Rogers said. She added that there is no reason they can\u2019t live for 20 years. The dogs weigh 10-15 pounds on average and the Rogerses offer a choice of color and two types of coat \u2014 curly or very curly, she said.\n\nThe popularity of the baby look for dogs started more than a half-century ago with mail-order teacup pups advertised in the backs of magazines. Yorkies, Maltese and Pomeranians were popular for a while, and recently there have been hybrid hounds \u201cwith cutesy names that end in \u2018-oodle,\u2019 \u2018-uddle\u2019 or \u2018-poo\u2019 that come with thousand-dollar price tags,\u201d said author and certified animal behavior consultant Darlene Arden of Massachusetts.\n\nArden said she was unfamiliar with the cava-poo-chon, though she applauded the use of a geneticist.\n\nBut she condemned \u201cgimmicks\u201d that some breeders and groomers use to attract unwitting buyers.\n\n\u201cThere is no such thing as a teacup anything,\u201d Arden said. \u201cIt is a market term used by backyard breeders and commercial breeders so they can breed the smallest dogs that shouldn\u2019t be bred and sell them for a whole lot of money. These dogs usually end up having health problems and most veterinarians don\u2019t want to touch them because the organs are so small.\u201d\n\nThe American Kennel Club does not recognize the cava-poo-chon.\n\n\u201cAKC does not recognize cross-bred or mixed breed dogs as official breeds,\u201d spokeswoman Lisa Peterson said. \u201cThese dogs are the product of two purebred parents of different breeds, resulting in a litter of mixed breed puppies, not a new breed, according to our requirements.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Specially bred dogs: Perfect pets or designer gimmicks?", "title": "Specially bred dogs: Perfect pets or designer gimmicks?", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/11/22/specially-bred-dogs-perfect-pets-or-designer-gimmicks/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131122__20131123_C8_FE23STPUPPYFACEp1.jpg", "height": 482}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131122__20131123_C8_FE23STPUPPYFACEp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-22T17:46:23+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-29T09:54:18+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0fdb\"", "article_summary": "\u201cAKC does not recognize cross-bred or mixed breed dogs as official breeds,\u201d spokeswoman Lisa Peterson said.\nEnter the \u201ccava-poo-chon.\u201d The breed is the newest and latest in the decades-old search for the dog-face fountain of youth and perfect pet accessory.\n\u201cUntil recently, specialized dogs like miniature Yorkies and miniature Maltese were the go-to dogs.\u201dThe cava-poo-chon is a cavalier King Charles spaniel and bichon frise mix bred with a miniature poodle.\nIt would have the yap bred out and longevity bred in.\nBut she condemned \u201cgimmicks\u201d that some breeders and groomers use to attract unwitting buyers."}
