It is why the jihadist movement\u2019s latest iteration, Islamic State, is also a problem.\n\nWhile Islamic State seems to lack real support among Saudis, some may sympathize with its broader goals, approving of its rhetoric against Shi\u2019ites and the West and its criticism of corruption among the Al Saud.\n\nBy executing al Qaeda ideologues and attackers, Riyadh was showing its determination to crush support for the militant cause. By also killing four Shiites, angering Iran in the process, it was telling conservative Sunnis it was still on their side.\n\nThe notion that Saudi Arabia believes it is facing not only a physical threat, but an ideological battle with a rival interpretation of Salafi Islam, was strengthened by state media\u2019s focus on Faris al-Shuwail al-Zahrani among the executed.\n\nZahrani, bearded, bespectacled, and in prison since 2004, is portrayed in Saudi media as al Qaeda\u2019s main ideologue during a series of attacks on expatriate housing compounds, police stations and oil facilities that killed hundreds.\n\nDescribed at the time by the government as \u201cone of the heads of strife, a preacher of takfir\u201d, Zahrani helped articulate the jihadist view that the Al Saud had abandoned Islam, and that it was the duty of Muslims to kill them and their allies.\n\nTakfir, the process of excommunicating other Muslims by calling them infidels, is a central pillar of Salafi Islam. But unlike in Saudi Arabia\u2019s so-called Wahhabi version of Salafism, in which only Riyadh\u2019s state-appointed clergy are permitted to practise takfir, the jihadists say any Muslim can declare another to be infidel.\n\nThat and other differences have set up a fierce enmity between the kingdom\u2019s official clergy \u2013 which runs the Sharia Islamic courts that sentenced to death the 43 al Qaeda figures executed on Saturday \u2013 and the jihadist ideologues whose main target is the Al Saud.\n\n\u201cThe official view is that these people are extremists involved in a wanton excommunication of other Muslims, in disobedience to the rightful ruler and in \u2018sowing dissention and disorder in the land\u2019. So they are beyond the pale of Sunni Islam,\u201d said Bernard Haykel, professor of Near Eastern Studies at Princeton.\n\nThe jihadists dispute Saudi Arabia\u2019s claim to lead Salafi Islam, the position of its state-appointed clergy as arbiters of religious orthodoxy, and the Al Saud\u2019s status as legitimate rulers of the country.\n\nOfficial Saudi media presented the jihadist Zahrani and the Shiite Nimr as equivalents \u2013 \u201cinciters of violence and terrorism\u201d as Sunday morning newspapers described them.\n\nIt seemed to be an attempt by the government to reassure conservative Sunnis that Saturday\u2019s executions did not mean Riyadh would stop championing their sect against what it portrays as Shiite aggression across the Middle East.\n\n\u201cMy sense is the Shiite executions are a very convenient foil,\u201d said Haykel, adding that while the Al Saud did not regard its Shiite minority as posing as grave a threat as the jihadists, putting some of them to death helped rally the rulers\u2019 conservative base.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Beliefs", "generator": "Easy Digital Downloads v2.5.16", "og": {"site_name": "Religion News Service", "description": "While a noted Shiite cleric was among those executed Saturday, dozens of others were Sunni militants -- a rising group troubling the Saudi government.", "title": "Fear of Sunni militancy drove Saudi mass execution (ANALYSIS)", "url": "http://religionnews.com/2016/01/03/fear-of-sunni-militancy-drove-saudi-mass-execution-analysis/", "image": "http://religionnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/thumbRNS-NimrProtestsJan3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@RNS", "card": "summary"}, "syndication-source": "http://religionnews.com/2016/01/03/fear-of-sunni-militancy-drove-saudi-mass-execution-analysis/", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://religionnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-RNS_logo_RGB-336x336.gif", "original-source": "http://religionnews.com/2016/01/03/fear-of-sunni-militancy-drove-saudi-mass-execution-analysis/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "While a noted Shiite cleric was among those executed Saturday, dozens of others were Sunni militants -- a rising group troubling the Saudi government."}, "article_summary": "So they are beyond the pale of Sunni Islam,\u201d said Bernard Haykel, professor of Near Eastern Studies at Princeton.\nThat was why the al Qaeda uprising that began in 2003, and attacked the Al Saud by turning its own conservative Salafi brand of Sunni Islam against it, was such a danger.\nOfficial Saudi media presented the jihadist Zahrani and the Shiite Nimr as equivalents \u2013 \u201cinciters of violence and terrorism\u201d as Sunday morning newspapers described them.\nBy executing al Qaeda ideologues and attackers, Riyadh was showing its determination to crush support for the militant cause.\nBy also killing four Shiites, angering Iran in the process, it was telling conservative Sunnis it was still on their side."}
