With movie musicals no longer a widely seen medium, were songs on film dying out? Were they still worth honoring \u2014 especially with big production numbers in an already-long ceremony?\n\nLast year, with Adele\u2019s hit title song for \u201cSkyfall\u201d taking the prize, put those fears to rest, and this year has an equally big nominee: \u201cLet It Go,\u201d sung by Idina Menzel and the centerpiece of animated hit \u201cFrozen,\u201d which \u2014 unusually for a film in this category \u2014 plays a pivotal role in the plot. In an era when even animated films have moved away from on-screen music, \u201cFrozen\u201d is the sort of throwback musical this category once existed to honor.\n\nRobert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez, the married co-writers of \u201cLet It Go,\u201d told Salon this morning that they weren\u2019t sure if there\u2019d be a \u201cFrozen\u201d production number at the Oscars this year. \u201cIt\u2019s different every year,\u201d said Lopez. \u201cIt would be an awesome thing to have Idina up there.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would hope the world would get to see her,\u201d said Anderson-Lopez.\n\nUnusual perhaps for a best original song contender in the modern era, the pair said they spent months leading up to the composition of \u201cLet It Go\u201d working out character beats with the film\u2019s creative team \u2014 \u201ctalk and talk, and work and work, to get these characters to be the kind of characters who can sustain a musical,\u201d said Anderson-Lopez. \u201cBut once we had this song slotted and [the character\u2019s] powers in place \u2014 we came up with the hook and a day and a half later we had the song. We went to Prospect Park in Brooklyn and sat on a picnic bench and wrote it out, and the demo was recorded a day later.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The hit film's potential EGOT winner and his co-writer discuss why the best original song category still matters", "title": "\u201cFrozen\u201d songwriters on their Oscar nomination and the state of the movie musical", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The hit film's potential EGOT winner and his co-writer discuss why the best original song category still matters", "title": "\u201cFrozen\u201d songwriters on their Oscar nomination and the state of the movie musical", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/01/16/frozen_songwriters_on_their_oscar_nomination_and_the_state_of_the_movie_musical/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/frozen2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The hit film's potential EGOT winner and his co-writer discuss why the best original song category still matters", "title": "\u201cFrozen\u201d songwriters on their Oscar nomination and the state of the movie musical", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/frozen2.jpg", "creator": "@dpd_", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Daniel D'Addario", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, frozen, kristen anderson-lopez, robert lopez, the oscars", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc6af\"", "article_summary": "In an era when even animated films have moved away from on-screen music, \u201cFrozen\u201d is the sort of throwback musical this category once existed to honor.\nWith movie musicals no longer a widely seen medium, were songs on film dying out?\nTopics: frozen, kristen anderson-lopez, robert lopez, the oscars, Entertainment NewsIn recent years, the best original song category has come in for some criticism \u2014 never more so than in 2012, when the category only had two nominees.\nRobert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez, the married co-writers of \u201cLet It Go,\u201d told Salon this morning that they weren\u2019t sure if there\u2019d be a \u201cFrozen\u201d production number at the Oscars this year.\n\u201cIt would be an awesome thing to have Idina up there.\u201d\u201cI would hope the world would get to see her,\u201d said Anderson-Lopez."}
