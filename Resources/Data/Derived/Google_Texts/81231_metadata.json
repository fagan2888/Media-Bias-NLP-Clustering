from a rare skin infection doubled within the last month, according to the city's Health Department.\n\nOn Thursday, the city said there have been 66 reported cases of the infection, which was predominantly found to affect those who handled live or raw seafood in the Manhattan, Brooklyn or Queens Chinatowns.\n\nThe Health Department's earliest report about the outbreak was in early March, when there were only 30 reported cases.\n\nHowever, officials said on Thursday that the increase in rep rotes doesn't necessarily mean all new cases of the infection, caused by bacteria called Mycobacterium marinum.\n\nThe Health Department also said that most of the recently reported cases were probably likely sought medical attention for existing conditions after it released more information on the outbreak.\n\nSome of the recently reported cases were probably likely sought medical attention for existing conditions after it released more information on the outbreak, according to the Health Department.\n\n\"Most people seem to have been infected last fall, with a few number of people having reported that their symptoms started more recently,\" a spokesperson with the agency said. \"We are investigating each reported case.\"\n\nSymptoms include red, tender lumps or swelling under the skin of their hands or arms and occasional swelling or pain in the hands or arms.\n\nAs previously reported, agency said there is no evidence that eating seafood leads to infection nor can it be transferred between people.\n\nNonetheless, the city continues to recommends anyone handling either live or raw seafood, or containers with either, use waterproof gloves.\n\nFollow Chester Jesus Soria on Twitter @chestersoria", "article_metadata": {"description": "Skin infections from fish
