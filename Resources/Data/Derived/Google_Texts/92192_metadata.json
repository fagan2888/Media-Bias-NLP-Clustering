It\u2019s reportedly one of the first studies to examine the cellular mechanisms behind tDCS, which can help reduce depression, and was published in Nature Communications.\n\nFor years, tDCS has been used to treat a myriad of mental health disorders and boost cognitive function. It\u2019s a quick, non-invasive procedure that involves routing weak electric currents through the head and into certain brain regions. Its benefits have been widely touted in studies, and include decreasing depressive symptoms, improving stroke patients\u2019 motor skills, sharpening focus, and enhancing learning. Despite this, \u201clittle is known about [tDCS\u2019] mechanism of action,\u201d the authors wrote in the abstract. In their latest study, they decided to find out.\n\n\u201cWhile we have known the clinical benefits of this kind of stimulation for quite some time, our research is aimed at understanding the cellular mechanisms through which its effects are made possible,\u201d Hajime Hirase, an author of the study, said in the press release.\n\nThe Role Of \u2018Calcium Surges\u2019 In Depression\n\nFor the study, researchers examined mice that had been genetically modified to express a calcium-indicating protein when illuminated by fluorescent light \u2014 a technique known as optogenetics. They then used a fluorescence microscope to examine the calcium activity in the brain. As they administered tDCS in the mice, astrocytes began to produce significant calcium waves. Astrocytes are involved in building the brain\u2019s physical structure, regulating electrical impulses, and generating calcium waves. The researchers could tell that the calcium wasn\u2019t made by the neurons because in a second experiment, they knocked out a receptor in the astrocytes that completely stopped the calcium production.\n\n\u201cSurprisingly, the calcium surges occurred very quickly after stimulation onset and appeared synchronized all over the cortex not only near the stimulated location,\u201d Hiromu Monai, lead author of the study, said in the press release.\n\nThe researchers observed that the mice's depression-like behavior didn't get better after applying tDCS when they blocked the astrocytic calcium waves. It\u2019s likely, then, \u201cthat the positive effects of transcranial direct stimulation on depression lie in these widespread calcium surges,\u201d Monai said. \u201cBut, we also wanted to investigate their effects on neural plasticity in general.\u201d\n\nThey also observed plastic changes in the mice\u2019s brains \u2014 or changes in neuronal connections involved in learning and making new memories \u2014 after tDCS. This suggests that in the future, targeting astrocytes and spurring calcium could work as a therapeutic factor in new treatments for depression or other mental health disorders. More research will need to be completed first, however, to understand why calcium waves can treat depression or induce brain plasticity.\n\nSource: Monai H, Ohkura M, Tanaka M, Oe Y, Konno A, Hirai H.
