That this year\u2019s flu vaccine doesn\u2019t work. The truth, as usual, is somewhat more nuanced.\n\nIt\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess where our nation\u2019s unhealthy distrust of science comes from.\n\nIs is simply a healthy skepticism?\n\nIs it a sign of our historical attachment to relatively intransigent and unforgiving religions (just ask Galileo, who was \u201cpardoned\u201d only a few years back for his crime of suggesting that the earth rotated around the sun, and not the other way around)?\n\nOr has the Republican party\u2019s fixation on fallacy so jaded the American public that no one trust anything any more, least of which scientific \u201ctruths\u201d that come from the god-awful guvmint.\n\nWe\u2019ve written before about the rather-vocal fringe that claims that vaccines are tools of the devil guaranteed to give your child autism. (Hint: They\u2019re really not, and they really don\u2019t.)\n\nBut back to the matter at hand. Dr. Katz over at HuffPo explains that while this year\u2019s flu vaccine may not be the perfect vaccine at preventing the rather-nasty strain of the flu that\u2019s going around, that doesn\u2019t mean that the vaccine is entirely worthless. In fact, the vaccine still may lessen your symptoms even if you do get sick.\n\nAnd boy is this a nasty strain going around. My cousin, his wife and their kid all got sick. Apparently it\u2019s a nasty 104F fever along with a nasty cough that doesn\u2019t go away for month. My nephew, who\u2019s staying with us, also has it now, and as I have asthma, in addition to some meetings I can\u2019t miss next week, I\u2019m going to get a prescription of Tamiflu, which may, or may not, help either prevent catching the bug, or at least help it not be as severe if I do get it.\n\nI did a little research on Tamiflu, and I won\u2019t say the jury is out on it. But the jury is mixed. While some poo-poo its effectiveness (Tamiflu works by suppressing viral replication), from what I\u2019ve gleaned it does seem to work to a degree. The only question is the trade-off between the risks of the drug vs the benefits. It seems there\u2019s more consenus about using the drug for someone who\u2019s already showing symptoms than for someone who is has been exposed to the virus.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019m on my Tamiflu, as are mom and dad. And flu-ridden nephew is going to get his shortly. So, time will tell.
