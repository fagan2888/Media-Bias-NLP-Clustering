President Obama, who has been criticized for a Spock-like aloofness, is no exception.\n\nThe only difference is, he became president just as the world of social media exploded, and his words and images have been retweeted, shared and transformed into online memes. He's not just the first black president; he's the first viral president. He now even has his own Twitter account.\n\nTo be sure, some of those moments have been scripted, such as his Buzzfeed video to sell Obamacare and his \"Between Two Ferns\" interview\n\nBut as his presidency approaches its final 18 months, here are some of the viral moments that offer a peek into Obama's playfulness and racial pride -- as well as a mean streak that seems like a requisite for the Oval Office:\n\nThe racial pioneer\n\nObama doesn't talk much about his race, but he's still found subtle yet memorable ways to invoke his racial heritage.\n\nObama's bicultural language -- he could communicate with black and white audiences in different ways -- manifested itself in a video that went viral. In it, Obama is seen shaking hands with a white staffer in the Team USA locker room before offering Kevin Durant a vastly more expressive greeting.\n\nSuch scenes inspired a famous skit by the comedians Key & Peele.\n\nIn the first year of his presidency, a 5-year-old black boy visiting Obama in the Oval Office had an odd question for the president. The photo of Obama's answer became a classic.\n\nThe son of a White House staffer wanted to know if the president's hair felt like his.\n\nObama's connection with working-class people of color helped propel him to the White House. An impromptu greeting he shared with a janitor captured that bond.\n\nPresident Obama fist-bumps custodian Lawrence Lipscomb in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building.\n\nEvery president has to know how to work a stage. Obama took his penchant for performance in an unexpected direction one night when he stood on the famed Apollo Theater in New York City.\n\nJUST WATCHED President Obama shows off his singing skills Replay More Videos ...

It was a prelude to vicious partisan warfare that would mark his term in office. Here are others.\n\nDuring this year's State of the Union address, Obama delivered a classic \"drop-the-mic\" moment when Republican legislators heckled him. His response inspired Internet memes\n\nJUST WATCHED Obama pokes fun at GOP during State of the Union speech Replay More Videos ...

During a tense televised meeting over Obamacare with Republicans, he delivered a putdown to his former Republican opponent for the White House that still hurts today when you listen.\n\nJUST WATCHED 2010: Obama tells McCain, 'The election's over' Replay More Videos ...

During one tense televised debate, Obama encouraged Romney to walk into a rhetorical trap with an ominous invitation that became a meme : \"Please proceed, governor.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Obama, Romney get heated over Libya Replay More Videos ...

But he also has a playful side that he flashed even amid the most the tense moments of his presidency.\n\nDuring one campaign stop at a Florida pizza shop, Obama met one supporter who couldn't contain his excitement. His \"greeting\" of Obama became a classic photo.\n\nRestaurant owner Scott Van Duzer lifts the president during a Florida campaign visit in 2012.\n\nEven presidents have to walk the dog. The photo of Obama trying to keep up with Bo, the new presidential pup, captured his youthful vigor.\n\nPresident Obama welcomes Bo, a Portuguese water dog, to the White House in April 2009.\n\nPoliticians get caught in all sorts of tangled webs. Obama's reaction to getting caught in one outside the Oval Office became a classic.\n\nPresident Obama pretends to be caught in Spider-Man's web as an aide's son goes trick-or-treating.\n\nPoliticians hold babies at their risk.

But offering an almost weekly image of an intact, affectionate black family may be one of Obama's most underrated achievements.\n\nDuring an event marking the 50th anniversary of the Bloody Sunday march in Selma, Alabama, Obama was sitting next to his wife onstage when they both did something that was subtle, and so romantic.\n\nFirst lady Michelle Obama holds the hand of her husband during a ceremony marking 50 years since Bloody Sunday.\n\nTo celebrate his 2012 re-election, Obama tweeted out a photo of him and his wife, Michelle, embracing with the simple message, \"Four more years.\" It would become the most retweeted photo in history.\n\nFour more years. pic.twitter.com/bAJE6Vom \u2014 Barack Obama (@BarackObama) November 7, 2012\n\nThe President and his wife were at a Team USA basketball game in Washington when the \"kiss cam\" displayed their image before the arena.
