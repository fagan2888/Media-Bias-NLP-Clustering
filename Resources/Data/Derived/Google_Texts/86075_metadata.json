You managed to spare yourself from one hell of a headache due to banging your noggin against the wall, trying to make any sense of what is called \u201cthe electorate.\u201d So, let me quickly bring you up to snuff on what you missed:\n\nAfter months and months of campaigning highlighted by vicious take-downs, reckless accusations and apocalyptic warnings about what will happen if you vote in \u201cthe other guy,\u201d by this time tomorrow, the Republicans are widely expected to be poised to take control of next year\u2019s U.S. Senate.\n\nUnless they\u2019re not.\n\nTwo states, Louisiana and Georgia, may not declare a winner due to no candidate receiving at least 50% of the vote, in which case we\u2019ll be subjected and subjugated to two MORE months of round-the-clock speculation, over-heated rhetoric and 24/7 attack ads, until these states hold their run-off elections. Which are so named because by that time, every instinct in a voter\u2019s body is urging them to \u201crun off\u201d somewhere and hide.\n\nPolls long established that this is the lowest-rated Congress ever largely because it\u2019s also the least-productive ever, yet the voters are primed to reward the party that shut the government down. Not to mention being the party that largely made good on its boast to block everything the president proposed, so as to make him look bad.\n\nAlso, even though the public is disgusted and fed up and by a large majority is convinced the country is heading in the wrong direction, this was an election with \u201cno issues.\u201d As in, no national issues galvanizing the masses to stampede to their polling places. It was supposed to be the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare, with Republicans issuing a clarion call for its repeal, only, wouldn\u2019t ya know, it turns out the darned thing is working pretty well, so the GOP mostly dropped it as a talking point. But you wouldn\u2019t know that it\u2019s a success, either, because instead of touting it, Democratic candidates didn\u2019t mention it, neither.\n\nSame is pretty much true with the economy. Best its\u2019 been in years, so the GOP couldn\u2019t muster umbrage about it, but for some reason, the Dems demurred taking credit for it resuscitating under their watch.\n\nAnother \u201cnon issue\u201d was the DESTRUCTION OF THE ENTIRE PLANET!!!! The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change just read the world the riot act concerning global warming. In it\u2019s latest report, it cites man-made climate change as significantly contributing to massive forest die-off, accelerating rises in sea levels, increased coastal flooding, crop and people killing heat waves, and will lead to an inexorable increase in world-wide poverty, if something isn\u2019t done IMMEDIATELY.\n\nBut GOP candidates begged off the issue, insisting that they\u2019re \u201cnot scientists.\u201d They\u2019re not geologists, gynecologists, religious scholars or poor either, but that never stops them from having opinions about fracking, abortion, same-sex marriage or social welfare programs. And, once again, Democrats didn\u2019t fill the void and browbeat their opponents for letting the world burn, because for them, it was too \u201chot\u201d an issue.\n\nInstead, some candidates stirred up a hornet\u2019s nest with dire but vague warnings about illegal immigrants and ISIS and Ebola and illegal immigrants from ISIS with Ebola, and that it, whatever \u201cit\u201d is, was all Obama\u2019s fault.\n\nObama. President Obama\u2019s the closest resemblance to a national issue the GOP had, although except for those who hated him from Day One, nobody really explained exactly what he\u2019s done to deserve this heap of scorn. But he must\u2019a done sumpin\u2019, because several Democratic candidates avoided even acknowledging that they voted for him. And the others didn\u2019t want to be seen anywhere near the man.\n\nSpeaking of the Senate candidates, whose job it will be, in part, to make and vote on legislation, they ran ads depicting their qualifications for the position by shooting rifles, hunting, snow-mobiling, farming, fileting pigs, wrasslin\u2019 alligators, slopping around in mud, and anything except waxing on the matters of the day.\n\nMeanwhile, most of the ugliness was fueled by unprecedented, obscene piles of \u201coutside money,\u201d much of it unattributable, meaning that those making the negative claims and flinging the baseless charges didn\u2019t have to answer for them.\n\nThe upshot of all this is that a rousing 40% of eligible voters are expected to go to the polls, if by \u201celigible\u201d you mean \u201cregistered\u201d and not \u201cinformed.\u201d After it\u2019s all over, our leaders will unfailinglextol the virtues of American democracy, pointing to our free elections as proof that \u201cthe system works.\u201d\n\nRelated articles", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Article 3", "description": "It\u2019s Election Day!!!
