But it\u2019s also smart politics. Trump carries many positions, from admiring comments about Bill Clinton to support for Obamacare-like health policies, that jeopardize his standing with grass-roots conservatives. Palin, with her unimpeachable conservative cred, stands ready to vouch for him.\n\nIndeed, while Palin has high negative ratings among the general public, she also has a large, devoted following among voters that many GOP strategists say have been neglected by the mainstream candidates.\n\nTrump, Republican consultant Ed Rollins said, has benefited from an \u201cincredible voter disconnect\u201d by the rest of the Republican primary field and now stands to carve off a large slice of conservative Palin followers.\n\n\u201cAt this point in time, there\u2019s a lot of people that still like her,\u201d Rollins said. \u201cThere\u2019s a significant tea party out there that she can tap into.\u201d\n\nStuart Stevens, the strategist for Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 presidential campaign, said the Palin-Trump alliance bolsters both of them.\n\n\u201cGood for both of them and smart on Trump\u2019s part,\u201d Stevens said in an email. \u201cShe appeals to a certain segment of the electorate and has been largely left out of the discussion and, for her, it\u2019s a way to participate more in [the] discussion.\u201d\n\nSo far, it\u2019s been a down year for Palin. She parted ways with Fox News. Her speech at the Iowa Freedom Summit cattle call last January was derided as \u201cmeandering and often bizarre\u201d by The National Review\u2019s John Fund. That same month, a CBS poll indicated that just 30 percent of Republicans wanted to see her run for president, while 59 percent did not.\n\nThose toxic numbers, combined with her low ratings among the moderate voters who often decide general elections, appear to have scared away Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, Rand Paul, Scott Walker and other mainstream contenders. But Palin still has a whopping 1.16 million followers on Twitter and 4.4 million Facebook likes \u2014 only two indicators of her clout in the party\u2019s volatile grass roots.\n\nOn Friday, Palin called those loyalists to action with a piece in Breitbart.com, casting Trump as the candidate of \u201cJoe Six-Pack\u201d Americans.\n\n\u201cThe elites are shocked by Trump\u2019s dominance, but everyday Americans aren\u2019t,\u201d Palin wrote. \u201cEverywhere I\u2019ve gone this summer, including motorsport events in Detroit full of fed-up Joe Six-Pack Americans, the folks I meet commiserate about wussified slates of politicians, but then unsolicited, they whisper their appreciation for Trump because he has the guts to say it like it is.\u201d\n\nA day earlier, Trump\u2019s presidential campaign announced that it had hired a national political director, Michael Glassner. He was a top aide to Palin during Sen. John McCain\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign.\n\nThe common thread with Palin and Trump, beyond a track record for statements that win headlines but rankle wide swaths of Americans, is that they have both tried to draw on populist conservative enthusiasm while in the national spotlight.\n\nA former aide to Palin said the former governor has long liked Trump\u2019s habit of \u201ctelling it like it is.\u201d\n\n\u201cPalin and Trump seem like an odd couple, but their charisma taps into a following few are able to inspire to the same degree. And perhaps it is simply because they know who they are and don\u2019t care if others don\u2019t like them,\u201d the aide said. \u201cNo doubt, Palin is pleased to hear Trump acknowledge her strengths, and her fan base, because she remains relevant for another cycle.\u201d\n\nThat was on display in Palin\u2019s piece on Friday.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s unconventional candidacy is a shot in the arm for ordinary Americans fed up with the predictable poll tested blather of squishy milquetoast career politicians who campaign one way and govern another. But it\u2019s not just how Trump says it, it\u2019s what he\u2019s saying,\u201d Palin wrote. \u201cTrump has tapped into America\u2019s great populist tradition by speaking to concerns of working class voters.\u201d\n\nPalin\u2019s admiration for Trump precedes the campaign. Back in 2011, for instance, Palin, in an interview with Fox News, cheered Trump for going forward with his vow to investigate whether President Barack Obama had an actual American birth certificate.\n\n\u201cI respect what he\u2019s doing in putting his money where his mouth is,\u201d Palin told host Greta Van Susteren in April of that year. \u201cHe\u2019s actually investigating his speculation there on Obama\u2019s birth certificate and Obama\u2019s college records and all those things that Obama, though he promises to be a transparent official, he certainly isn\u2019t because he could certainly reveal many of these documents and put many of these issues to rest.\u201d\n\nA few months later, in June, Trump said he would \u201clove\u201d to see Palin run for president. Palin, in return, ticked off what she shared with Trump.\n\n\u201cWhat do we have in common? Our love for this country, a desire to see our economy put back on the right track,\u201d Palin said after a meeting at Trump\u2019s penthouse in Manhattan, according to The New York Post.\n\nIt hasn\u2019t stopped this year. In February 2015, Palin joked on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d that she could pick Trump as her running mate if she decided to run for president. Palin later provided valuable cover for Trump when he declared that her former running mate, McCain, isn\u2019t a war hero. She defended McCain and Trump together, calling them both heroes.\n\n\u201cSen. McCain dedicated his life to serving our country, and in my humble opinion the sacrifices made by all ethical service members are heroic \u2014 putting it all on the line to defend freedom IS heroic \u2014 and Donald Trump is a hero in another arena,\u201d Palin wrote in an email to CNN.\n\nRival Republican presidential campaigns have struggled to get attention as Trump hogs the limelight. And Palin can help him keep on doing it.\n\n\u201cAnticipate more battering and bashing storms around Trump,\u201d she wrote at the end of her Breitbart piece. \u201cIt\u2019s still very early in the game; folks are keeping their powder dry with candidate support but are quite happy Donald Trump is in the race.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Smart politics is behind the alliance of the GOP\u2019s two leading bomb-throwers.", "og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Smart politics is behind the alliance of the GOP\u2019s two leading bomb-throwers.", "title": "Can Palin sell Trump to 'Joe Six-Pack'?", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/08/sarah-palin-donald-trump-2016-alliance-120958.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/08/03/150731_donald_trump_sarah_palin_2_gty_1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "keywords": "Elections,Republicans,Donald Trump,2016 Elections,Sarah Palin,Donald Trump 2016", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/daniel.strauss.758"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "To many Republican presidential contenders, Sarah Palin is a skunk at the party, someone to be handled gingerly and kept at arm\u2019s length.\nBut it\u2019s not just how Trump says it, it\u2019s what he\u2019s saying,\u201d Palin wrote.\nOn Friday, Palin called those loyalists to action with a piece in Breitbart.com, casting Trump as the candidate of \u201cJoe Six-Pack\u201d Americans.\nRival Republican presidential campaigns have struggled to get attention as Trump hogs the limelight.\nHe was a top aide to Palin during Sen.
