An Arlington woman died Saturday after she crashed a motorcycle that she was test-driving at a Carrollton dealership.

Police say Sherry Gutkowski, 43, was riding the motorcycle in a private parking lot adjacent to a motorcycle dealership. The parking lot is in the 1300 block of Capital Parkway near Interstate 35E.

Gutkowski hit a curb, flipped and fell off the motorcycle about 5 p.m., police spokeswoman Jolene DeVito said. She was taken to Las Colinas Medical Center, where she was pronounced dead.

DeVito said the woman was wearing a helmet. Crime scene and accident investigators are looking into the cause of the crash and trying to determine whether it was a “freak accident,” she said.
