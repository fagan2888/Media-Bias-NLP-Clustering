A Chandler EMS ambulance ran into a cow in the road on Highway 66 in Lincoln County, Friday night.

The accident occurred on Highway 66, about six miles west of Chandler.

According to the Oklahoma Highway Patrol, the ambulance was responding to call when the cow ran out in front of them. The driver attempted to swerve to miss the cow, but the two collided causing the ambulance to rollover.

A witness said someone stopped to call police and alert them the cow was in the road just before the accident.



Troopers said there were no patients onboard at the time of the accident, and the driver was transported to the hospital with neck and back pain and later released with minor injuries.
