Has he retired? Has he died?\u201d\n\nAccording to the Independent, a legal case was launched against the man \u2014 Joaqu\u00edn Garc\u00eda \u2014 that year. It finally wrapped up this week, with Garc\u00eda, who retired in 2011, losing an appeal and being issued a fine of approximately $30,000, the Times reports. That's the equivalent of one year's salary after taxes, and was the most that could legally be reclaimed.\n\nThe investigation into Garc\u00eda determined he hadn't been to his office for at least six years\u2014and possibly as long as 14 years \u2014 and had done \"absolutely no work\" between 2007 and 2010.\n\nGarc\u00eda was supposed to be supervising the construction of a water treatment plant, the BBC reports. But the water company thought the city council was in charge of Garc\u00eda, while the city council thought the water company was in charge of him.\n\nA water company manager admitted to not having seen Garc\u00eda for years despite having an office across from him.\n\nGarc\u00eda argues he was bullied and given a job with no actual work to do because of his socialist politics. As for what he did with all his free time: The Guardian reports he became \"an avid reader of philosophy and an expert on the works of Spinoza.\" (A Spanish mayor made taking an afternoon nap the law.)\n\nThis story appeared originally on Newser: Man Skips Work for 6 Years, No One Notices", "article_metadata": {"description": "A 69-year-old Spanish man was fined this week after officials discovered he hadn't shown up to work for at least six years, the\u00a0Guardian\u00a0reports.
