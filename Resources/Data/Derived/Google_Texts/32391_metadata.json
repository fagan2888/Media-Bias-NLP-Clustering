(Photo: file photo)Buy Photo Story Highlights An Edison man was charged with setting fire to a Rutgers University hallway and classroom.\n\nShayam Sridhar, 21, was charged with a second-degree count of aggravated arson for setting the fire.\n\nThe fire was set while students were completing a final exam in the Allison Road Classroom building.\n\nA 21-year-old Edison man was charged Thursday with setting fire to a hallway and classroom at a building at the school\u2019s Busch Campus, said Middlesex County Prosecutor Andrew C. Carey and Director Kenneth Cop of the Rutgers University Police Department.\n\nShayam Sridhar was charged with a second-degree count of aggravated arson for setting the fire at the Allison Road Classroom (ARC) Building at 618 Allison Road on Dec. 20.\n\nSridhar was charged early Thursday during an investigation by Detective Todd Giese of the Rutgers University Police Department and Detective Todd O\u2019Malley of the Middlesex County Prosecutor\u2019s Office. The defendant had been a student at Rutgers, but left during the fall term. He had signed up to return to classes in January.\n\nSuperior Court Judge Joseph Paone set bail at $75,000 for Sridhar, who was being held at the Middlesex County Adult Corrections Center in North Brunswick.\n\n\u201cI commend the efforts of the local law enforcement agencies that coordinated their efforts to apprehend the defendant,\u201d Carey said. \u201cThese agencies include the Rutgers Police Department, the Edison Police Department and the Middlesex County Prosecutor\u2019s Office. These dedicated members of law enforcement spent time away from their own families and friends, in order to protect and serve our citizens during the holidays.\u201d\n\nSridhar was charged after Officer David Tingle of the Edison Police Department identified the defendant from a photo obtained during the investigation.\n\nThe investigation determined that Sridhar set fire to a 30-foot section of the hallway and the adjoining classroom on the second floor of the ARC Building at 1:03 p.m. on Dec. 20. The flash fire set off an alarm, forcing the evacuation of 210 students who were taking a final exam in a first-floor auditorium located beneath the burning hallway. No one was injured, Carey said.\n\nThe fire was extinguished by an overhead sprinkler, but damaged portions of the hallway and the classroom. Clean-up and repairs cost $250,000.\n\nCarey said the investigation is active and is continuing. Anyone with information is asked to call Giese at 848-933-8025 or O\u2019Malley at 732-745-3908.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://mycj.co/1AOgvSA", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "A 21-year-old Edison man was charged Thursday with setting fire to a hallway and classroom at a Rutgers University Busch Campus building.
