A man who attended Friday night’s bluegrass concert at Red Rocks Amphitheatre was climbing rocks after the show and fell as far as 100 feet to his death, authorities say.

A second man also fell while trying to reach his friend after the fall, said Ronda Scholting, spokeswoman for West Metro Fire Protection District. He survived with serious injuries.

Both men had attended the concert at Red Rocks of Yonder Mountain String Band.

The names of the victims have not been released.

The injured man apparently was knocked unconscious when he fell. He may have suffered a concussion. He had damage to his ribs, Scholting said.

The sunshine woke him up Saturday morning, he later told rescuers.

He crawled down a trail to the parking lot and collapsed next to his pickup truck, Scholting said.

Two passers-by found the man Saturday and called 911 at 9:37 a.m., she said. When rescuers arrived, the injured man had trouble describing where his buddy had fallen, she said.

“He was pretty banged up,” Assistant Chief Tony Wilkins said. “We rushed him emergent to a hospital.”

It took rescuers another half hour to find the other man’s body.

“The other climber unfortunately did not make it,” Wilkins said. “Our hearts go out to the families.”

Scholting said the two men may have climbed over the rocks from the amphitheatre and then fell, or they may have followed a trail before going off limits, she said.

“They fell from a closed area,” Scholting said.

It’s unclear how far the dead man fell. He landed on a rock shelf in a crevice. There are a few ledges he may have fallen from. The highest is about 100 feet above the crevice.

On Saturday, firefighters cleared brush away so they could get a gurney to the area where the man fell, Scholting said.
