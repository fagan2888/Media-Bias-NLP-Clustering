Company owners and executives are seeing the silver lining in a tough economy as businesses grow and are leaner and more efficient than ever. And, while hopeful of the sustainability of this growth, executives remain cautious, ever aware of the ups and downs this state has seen in recent history.\n\nThis year marks the thirteenth annual Power Poll conducted by Nevada Business Magazine. In this series, business owners and executives have been asked to weigh in on a variety of issues. From business to personal viewpoints and beyond, they were asked to give their thoughts on what the future may hold for the state. While not a scientific poll, the series has traditionally been representative of the mind-set of executives in Nevada.\n\nThis survey was sent at the beginning of 2015 to decision-makers throughout the state. They were asked to answer a series of questions designed to give readers a fairly accurate gauge of what Nevada executives\u2019 thoughts are in today\u2019s social and economic landscape. The poll also helps predict where the state may be headed in the future. This year\u2019s survey garnered hundreds of responses, the results of which are illustrated in the following pages. In addition, previous year\u2019s polls are shown for comparison purposes.\n\nAs is typical of the Power Poll, there was a nearly even split between business owner and executive responses with the former making up 55 percent of respondents. It is interesting to note that, while fairly even, the majority of respondents have switched from executives to business owners this year. Regardless of which title is held, they represent companies that are firmly rooted in Nevada. The majority of poll-takers work for businesses that have been around for 20 plus years and 79 percent have been doing business in Nevada for more than a decade.\n\nThe Silver State\u2019s Silver Lining\n\nAs the state moves further from the oppressive recession, it becomes apparent in several key industries, most of which continue to show signs of improvement. When asked how Nevada\u2019s economy compares to last year and where they expect it to go this year, the vast majority felt that both indicators were much improved. Nearly 80 percent affirmed that Nevada\u2019s economy is better than it was a year ago and just over 80 percent expect the economy to improve over the next 12 months.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be strong,\u201d said Don Bruce, manager and owner of 1-800-Got-Junk?, a disposal service based in Reno. \u201cLast year it was the bounce back, now it\u2019s building with progress. Things are solidly better in the Nevada economy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of hope in the market with the diversity of the economy that has happened as a result of the downfall,\u201d added Chet Opheikens, vice president of R & O Construction. \u201cA lot of leaders in our community have reached out to see what kind of opportunities are out there for all of us.\u201d\n\nIndividual businesses, in many cases, reflect Nevada\u2019s improving economy. And, while Edward Vance, CEO and founder of EV&A Architects said he is, \u201ccautiously optimistic,\u201d many executives indicated that they expect the coming year to bring a boom to their business. Vance added, \u201cI hope it will be better. Things are on the upward swing, but it\u2019s not as robust as I\u2019d like to see it. I think it could be slightly better.\u201d\n\nWhile the majority (65 percent) of respondents reported a bottom-line that is better than it was a year ago, a whopping 81 percent said they expect next year to be either somewhat or much better for their business. Windom Kimsey, president of Tate Snyder Kimsey Architects said that as, \u201can architecture firm, the recession lasted a little bit longer in our business, especially for people who do public projects, because of a lack of funding from government agencies. I see that frost melting away and some opportunities coming up.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to Nevada\u2019s distressed commercial real estate industry, Lonnie Roy, principal engineer at Broadbent & Associates, Inc. added, \u201cWe will be better. I see additional construction going on in Southern Nevada. There\u2019s a slight uptick in the clients we serve and projects we\u2019re proposing on. I see positive signs.\u201d\n\nTaxes\n\nBusiness owners tend to think of Nevada as a business-friendly state; with nearly 90 percent agreeing, there\u2019s a clear consensus.\n\n\u201cWe really are business-friendly,\u201d said Vance. \u201cThat\u2019s a strong positive because I do work all over the country. We can get entitlements on projects and property faster than any place I\u2019ve ever been.\u201d\n\nHowever, many executives expressed concern over taxes in the state and whether Nevada is headed in the right direction in that regard. Sixty-eight percent of respondents felt that Nevada businesses already have too much of a tax burden.\n\n\u201cRecent speeches by the governor lead me to believe that you may be seeing higher taxes,\u201d said John Kley, division president for First Savings Bank in Las Vegas. \u201cWe need to be attracting and growing our industry and diversifying our marketplace. We can\u2019t do that if we have unfriendly tax laws that don\u2019t encourage businesses to move from California, Arizona or other surrounding states.\u201d\n\nGabrielle Sansone, director of large group sales with Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield added, \u201cA lot of companies from California move to Nevada because we have a more positive business tax structure. However, I worry about this new tax the governor is going to pass. I get that we need to raise money for schools but I\u2019m concerned it\u2019s going to hurt businesses to the point where they don\u2019t come here.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of concerns over future taxes, only nine percent of respondents said they would support a state income tax if it were proposed. Sansone said that, \u201cpart of the reason Nevada is so attractive is because we don\u2019t have a state income tax.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about two of the state\u2019s largest industries, gaming and mining, in relation to tax burden, many felt they pay a fair share. Just over 70 percent said Nevada\u2019s gaming industry pays their share and nearly half of respondents said the same in regards to Nevada\u2019s mining industry.\n\n\u201cWe need to be smarter about how we spend money, not figure out how to get more so we can spend more,\u201d said Vance.\n\nHelp Wanted\n\nOne area with dismal numbers in the midst of the recession that has seen an uptick in recent years is employment. In the past year, 52 percent of executives hired, with only 8 percent of those polled showing a decrease in their staff. Even more encouraging, nearly 60 percent of respondents expect to hire in the next year.\n\n\u201cIn my industry, we have to look ahead,\u201d said Opheikens. \u201cAs far as my own internal staffing, that will likely stay the same, there may be a slight increase. However, I do see the trades, the subcontractors, their needs will increase dramatically because of the type of projects that are being proposed at this time.\u201d\n\nTwo employment-related issues that are unpopular with business owners are a proposal to increase the minimum wage and the necessity of unions. Only 39 percent of executives support a call to increase the minimum wage in Nevada.\n\nKley said that companies, \u201cshould be controlling their own bottom line through the use of things that make sense relative to their business. You should be a good corporate citizen and pay your people appropriately. I don\u2019t think it needs to be dictated to us.\u201d\n\nIn addition, union\u2019s have declined in popularity in recent years with only 23 percent of respondents calling them necessary to the state\u2019s workforce.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a right-to-work state,\u201d added Kley. \u201cI encourage people to allow free economies to operate freely.\u201d\n\nImpacting Society\n\nKey issues have become a focus for Nevadans in recent years. One such issue, education, has been an blemish on Nevada\u2019s record for years. As the state strives to overcome an appearance on the bottom of several rankings for education in this country, executives add their voices to the mix. Sixty-two percent of respondents would give education in Nevada a D or below; unfortunately, that\u2019s a failing grade.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re overburdened with administration and policy rather than [having a] focus on teacher\u2019s needs to appropriately progress the students,\u201d said Bruce. He added that, \u201cWe could do so much better and, for long-term economic growth, we need to do so much better.\u201d\n\nWhen asked what the most important need is for Nevada to fix education, the highest percentage (31 percent) was found with parental involvement. Reform and funding tied for second-place with a voucher-program being ranked last among the six options given.\n\nKley suggested that, \u201cwe spend an awful lot of time re-reforming without necessarily getting to the cause. There\u2019s a lot of new conversation about reform of education. Perhaps we should just concentrate on the fundamentals of education.\u201d\n\nOther issues that were addressed in this year\u2019s poll include the Affordable Care Act (ACA), legalization of marijuana and gay marriage. Although not as concerned as last year, there is still concern amongst executives regarding the ACA. Over half indicated that they were \u201csomewhat\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d concerned about the Act.\n\n\u201cThe paperwork part of it has become more of a struggle for the company,\u201d said Roy. \u201cThere\u2019s been a complete lack of clarity of where we\u2019re going for the past two years.\u201d\n\nSansone added that, \u201cWhen they wrote this law, they didn\u2019t take into consideration all of the ramifications and abrasions that are going to happen. What it does is force employers to cut back hours, lay off people and start thinking differently because of the ways the laws are written. It\u2019s not employer-friendly.\u201d\n\nFor marijuana legalization, executives are closely split at 55 percent against legalization. Gay marriage shows a wider margin among executives with only 33 percent unsupportive.\n\nReferring to gay marriage, Sansone said, \u201cI don\u2019t care one way or the other, it doesn\u2019t bother me.\u201d While Bruce, who spoke out against the practice added that, \u201cIt conflicts with everything I know ethically and morally. While I support people\u2019s freedom of choice, I do not support that it becomes a government-sponsored choice.\u201d\n\nPolitics As Usual\n\nThe most recent election showed a dramatic change in elected officials with Republican gains in many states, including Nevada. This change is indicative of the people\u2019s demand for change. When asked to grade elected officials, executives responded, in many cases, as they had in previous years. However, with new names on the list this year, it\u2019s interesting to note what grade executives would give some officials based on how well they\u2019re expected to address Nevadan\u2019s interests.\n\nAs has become a trend for the past several years of this poll, President Barack Obama received a \u201cD\u201d for his work performance.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t get the feeling he\u2019s been as good at compromising,\u201d said Kimsey. \u201cHis agenda requires more compromise and it just hasn\u2019t worked out that way.\u201d\n\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, Governor Brian Sandoval has consistently been given a \u201cB\u201d for his efforts on behalf of the state. Opheikens said, \u201cHe\u2019s put together the proper leaders within the community and has created opportunities through economic development and diversification. He has helped lead us from the greatest recession we\u2019ve ever known. Do I agree with him raising taxes on all small businesses? Absolutely not.\u201d\n\nIssues of State\n\nFor the past few years, this poll has asked respondents to rank how concerned they are about six issues that continue to plague Nevada. This year, leading the list for executives is the quality of education in Nevada which received the highest percentage (37 percent) in the \u201cVery Concerned\u201d category. The least concerning issue was transportation which implies that executives think our state agencies are doing their job in that respect.\n\nAnother relatively new section we\u2019ve asked executives to rank is government involvement. This question asked respondents to indicate how concerned they were with the government being involved in certain areas that affect their lives. The majority (32 percent) said they were concerned about government involvement in education.\n\n\u201cI am a little bit concerned that we have centralized so much power in the Department of Education,\u201d explained Roy. \u201cThere may not be economy for school boards and the other local parts of education.\u201d\n\nNon-ACA related health issues was the least concerning for executives (15 percent) with religion and surveillance or privacy issues running a close second and third place, respectively. Kimsey did indicate that the, \u201cgovernment should be 100 percent steered clear of religion. Church and state don\u2019t mix very well.\u201d\n\nAll in all, this year\u2019s poll illustrated the new, hopeful attitude that many business owners and executives have towards the economy. With companies looking to hire and expand and a state economy that has seen several economic boons in recent months, the Silver State\u2019s future is looking bright.", "article_metadata": {"description": "This year marks the thirteenth annual Power Poll conducted by Nevada Business Magazine.", "og": {"site_name": "Nevada Business Magazine", "description": "This year marks the thirteenth annual Power Poll conducted by Nevada Business Magazine.", "title": "A New Hope: Power Poll 2015", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 300, "identifier": "http://www.nevadabusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/featured.jpg", "height": 225}, "updated_time": "2015-02-28T20:25:21-07:00", "url": "http://www.nevadabusiness.com/2015/03/a-new-hope-power-poll-2015/", "type": "article"}, "robots": "noodp", "article": {"section": "Feature Story", "tag": "Windom Kimsey", "published_time": "2015-03-01T00:11:34-07:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-28T20:25:21-07:00"}, "google-site-verification": "NC_os-83w0gjbGT2Fm1x_1aQGclHifhqFIwd_sxky1A", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde5ba\"", "article_summary": "This year marks the thirteenth annual Power Poll conducted by Nevada Business Magazine.\nThis question asked respondents to indicate how concerned they were with the government being involved in certain areas that affect their lives.\nAs is typical of the Power Poll, there was a nearly even split between business owner and executive responses with the former making up 55 percent of respondents.\nWhile not a scientific poll, the series has traditionally been representative of the mind-set of executives in Nevada.\nAnother relatively new section we\u2019ve asked executives to rank is government involvement."}
