As a result, the worker lost his employer-sponsored health insurance. While it may be unsettling to some in the workplace, several federal courts rule this type of action is legal. At least one court ruled in favor of Flambeau.\n\nHadley Heath Manning, director of health policy at the Independent Women's Forum, tells OneNewsNow that the idea behind employee wellness programs is good \u2013 in theory.\n\nManning\n\n\"Basically, these programs aim to encourage workers to lead healthier lifestyles by discouraging activities, such as smoking, and encouraging other activities, such as regular exercise,\" says Manning. \"But practically, these programs sometimes run into problems.\"\n\nLike health insurance, Manning says wellness programs shouldn't be one-size-fits-all. \"Health is very individual, so it's hard to subject everyone to the same standards,\" she says.\n\nRegardless, Manning does believe that wellness programs are becoming more popular. \"ObamaCare limits health insurance companies and the various ways they might reduce costs. In fact, premiums have been going up for all plans, including employer-sponsored plans,\" she explains.\n\nSo if there is any way for employers to save money on their health insurance premiums, they will likely take advantage. Meanwhile, if workers don't participate, those workers may face serious financial consequences.\n\n\"That's why some of them argue that these programs are more coercive than they are voluntary,\" says Manning. \"Any worker whose employer revokes health insurance coverage must go to the individual market, or an ObamaCare exchange, where premiums are sky-high for unsubsidized customers.\"\n\nShe does point out that people who go without insurance will most likely be subject to a tax penalty.\n\nThe bottom line, according to Manning, is that this illustrates how flawed the employer-centric health insurance system is, while serving as another argument for moving away from a system that favors employer-based insurance plans.", "article_metadata": {"description": "People who work in places with employee wellness programs may want to read the fine print when it comes to participation.", "og": {"url": "http://onenewsnow.com/business/2016/01/21/employee-wellness-programs-pros-and-cons", "image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://onenewsnow.com/media/5602265/treadmill.jpg", "height": 500}, "description": "People who work in places with employee wellness programs may want to read the fine print when it comes to participation.", "title": "Employee wellness programs: Pros and cons"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://onenewsnow.com/media/5602265/treadmill.jpg", "title": "Employee wellness programs: Pros and cons", "description": "People who work in places with employee wellness programs may want to read the fine print when it comes to participation.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@onenewsnowcom"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1597751183824293}, "keywords": "ObamaCare,Hadley Heath Manning,Independent Women's Forum,employer,employee,health insurance,Bloomberg,wellness program,health screening,fitness", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "People who work in places with employee wellness programs may want to read the fine print when it comes to participation.\nHadley Heath Manning, director of health policy at the Independent Women's Forum, tells OneNewsNow that the idea behind employee wellness programs is good \u2013 in theory.\nLike health insurance, Manning says wellness programs shouldn't be one-size-fits-all.\nRegardless, Manning does believe that wellness programs are becoming more popular.\nSo if there is any way for employers to save money on their health insurance premiums, they will likely take advantage."}
