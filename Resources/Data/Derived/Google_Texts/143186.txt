Traffic slowed down Saturday on the Conejo Grade on Highway 101 North after a boat being towed by a truck overturned on the highway.

The accident occurred about 10 a.m., but no information was immediately available on the cause.

Motorist Jim Martin, who snapped photos of the accident, said he was stuck in traffic for 20 minutes before the road began to clear.

"The traffic just stopped," the Camarillo businessman said.

The boat remained overturned in the roadway and officers were still on scene as of 1 p.m., but the middle and slow lanes were open, a dispatcher for the California Highway Patrol said.

She said no injuries had been reported.
