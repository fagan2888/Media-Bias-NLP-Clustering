Associated Press\n\nSOCHI, Russia\u2014Russia scored an upset victory in the men's 4x7.5km biathlon relay, winning gold in a thrilling final stretch as the favorite Norway simultaneously collapsed and failed to medal.\n\nAnton Shipulin of Russia, which maintained the third-place position through the first three legs of the race, chased down Simon Schempp of the silver medal-winning German team on the last sprint of the fourth and final leg of the relay, giving Russia a margin of victory of 3.5 seconds. The home team posted an overall time of 1 hour, 12 minutes, 15.9 seconds, The Austrian squad took the bronze.\n\nDefending champion Norway had been primed for the win, amassing a lead of 20 seconds after the second handoff, but disastrous marksmanship by Emil Hegle Svendsen on the final leg earned him a penalty lap, costing the team a medal of any color.\n\nNorway finished nearly a minute behind Russia. The loss of the relay gold leaves legendary Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Bjoerndalen with 8 career winter Olympic golds, tied for most all time with compatriot Bjorn Daehlie, a cross-country skier. Bjoerndalen, 40, surpassed Daehlie as the all-time winner of the most winter Olympic medals, with 13, during these Sochi Games. He won golds in both the individual sprint and the mixed relay.\n\nRussia's win sent the packed crowd into a frenzy, with spectators waving flags and chanting along to the national anthem played at the subsequent medal ceremony at the Laura Cross-Country Ski & Biathlon Center. Thanks in part to ample television coverage here, biathlon ranks as the second-favorite winter sport among Russians, according to a recent poll.\n\n\u2014Anton Troianovski contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Sara Germano at sara.germano@wsj.com", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "article.created": "2014-02-22T17:44:00.000Z", "article.section": "Sports", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "Article", "twitter": {"domain": "wsj.com", "description": "Russia scored an upset victory in the men's 4x7.5km biathlon relay, winning gold in a thrilling final stretch as the favorite Norway simultaneously collapsed and failed to medal.", "title": "Russia Wins Gold in Biathlon Men's Relay", "image": {"src": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-BQ439_olybia_G_20140222123057.jpg", "alt": "Russia wins gold in biathlon men's relay", "identifier": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-BQ439_olybia_D_20140222123057.jpg"}, "creator": "@germanotes", "site": "@WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "wsj://launch?articleid=SB10001424052702304275304579399101243472172&headline=Russia%20wins%20gold%20in%20biathlon%20men%26apos%3Bs%20relay&weburl=http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304275304579399101243472172"}}, "page.site.product": "WSJ", "keywords": "2014 olympics,2014 winter olympics,biathalon medal,medal count,olympic medal count,olympics,olympics main,sochi,sochi 2014,sochi olympics,biathlon,cross-country skiing,nordic skiing,sports,recreation,winter sports,routine general news", "news_keywords": "2014 olympics,2014 winter olympics,biathalon medal,medal count,olympic medal count,olympics,olympics main,sochi,sochi 2014,sochi olympics", "article.headline": "Russia wins gold in biathlon men's relay", "cXenseParse": {"candybar": {"image": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-BQ439_olybia_E_20140222123057.jpg"}, "poptart": {"image": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-BQ439_olybia_D_20140222123057.jpg"}}, "description": "Russia scored an upset victory in the men's 4x7.5km biathlon relay, winning gold in a thrilling final stretch as the favorite Norway simultaneously collapsed and failed to medal.", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=364387007,app-argument=wsj://launch?articleid=SB10001424052702304275304579399101243472172&headline=Russia%20wins%20gold%20in%20biathlon%20men%26apos%3Bs%20relay&weburl=http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304275304579399101243472172", "user.type": "nonsubscriber", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "Sports", "article.summary": "Russia scored an upset victory in the men's 4x7.5km biathlon relay, winning gold in a thrilling final stretch as the favorite Norway simultaneously collapsed and failed to medal.", "page.site": "wsj", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2014-02-23T09:01:00.000Z", "dj.asn": "i-43d1", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"internal_link_count": 5, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/scgermano", "image_count": 2, "word_count": 281, "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Article", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Russia scored an upset victory in the men's 4x7.5km biathlon relay, winning gold in a thrilling final stretch as the favorite Norway simultaneously collapsed and failed to medal.", "title": "Russia Wins Gold in Biathlon Men's Relay", "url": "http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304275304579399101243472172", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-BQ439_olybia_G_20140222123057.jpg", "height": 369}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "author": "Sara Germano", "article.access": "free", "page.content.source": "WSJ Online Article", "article.origheadline": "Russia Wins Gold in Biathalon Men\u2019s Relay", "article.type": "2014 Winter Olympics", "article.id": "SB10001424052702304275304579399101243472172", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-02-23T09:01:00.000Z"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfd5a\"", "article_summary": "Associated PressSOCHI, Russia\u2014Russia scored an upset victory in the men's 4x7.5km biathlon relay, winning gold in a thrilling final stretch as the favorite Norway simultaneously collapsed and failed to medal.\nENLARGE Russia's Anton Shipulin celebrates winning the gold after crossing the line of the men's biathlon 4x7.5 km relay.\nThe loss of the relay gold leaves legendary Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Bjoerndalen with 8 career winter Olympic golds, tied for most all time with compatriot Bjorn Daehlie, a cross-country skier.\nThanks in part to ample television coverage here, biathlon ranks as the second-favorite winter sport among Russians, according to a recent poll.\nThe home team posted an overall time of 1 hour, 12 minutes, 15.9 seconds, The Austrian squad took the bronze."}
