Among them are the Obama administration\u2019s top lawyer at the high court, with more than two dozen arguments behind him, and two lawyers making their first appearance before the justices.\n\nThe cases come from Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio and Tennessee, all of which had their marriage bans upheld by the federal appeals court in Cincinnati.\n\nThe justices will hear 2\u00bd hours of arguments on these two questions: whether same-sex couples have a constitutional right to marry and whether states must recognize same-sex marriages from elsewhere.\n\nCivil rights lawyer Mary Bonauto, backed by Solicitor General Donald Verrilli Jr., will argue for the right to marry. Former Michigan Solicitor General John Bursch will defend the state laws.\n\nOn the second question, Washington lawyer Douglas Hallward-Driemeier will urge the court to rule that states must recognize same-sex marriages performed elsewhere. On the other side will be Joseph Whalen, Tennessee\u2019s associate solicitor general.\n\nA look at the advocates:\n\n___\n\nBonauto has been called the Thurgood Marshall of the push for equal rights for gay and lesbian in the United States. She was the winning lawyer the first time a court granted same-sex couples the right to marry, in Massachusetts in 2003. She hopes her next argument is the last time same-sex marriage is tested in court.\n\nThe 53-year-old has been at the forefront of the legal fight for gay rights, including same-sex marriage, for more than two decades. But it will be her first argument before the nation\u2019s highest court.\n\nIn her early days as the civil rights project director at the Boston-based Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders, where she has worked for 25 years, Bonauto said she used to say no when same-sex couples asked her to take on their marriage cases in the courts. As recently as late 2012, Bonauto worried that the time was not yet right to ask the Supreme Court to settle the issue once and for all.\n\nBut that time has now arrived, she said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no reason to tell these families they should be denied legal respect. It\u2019s our hope that we soon will be able to secure that for people everywhere,\u201d Bonauto said in a recent call with reporters.\n\nBonauto received a MacArthur Foundation fellowship last year. She lives in Portland, Maine, with her wife, professor Jennifer Wriggins of the University of Maine\u2019s law school, and their twin teenage daughters.\n\n___\n\nBursch made a Supreme Court name for himself as Michigan\u2019s solicitor general, arguing eight cases at the high court in just over two years. That record included the contentious dispute over the state\u2019s voter-approved ban on the use of race in college admissions. He defended the ban and the justices sided with him last year.\n\nHis performance during that argument was typical of his appearances before the court \u2014 unflappable in the face of sustained, and at times hostile, questioning from Justice Sonia Sotomayor.\n\nSame-sex marriage opponents have pointed to Justice Anthony Kennedy\u2019s opinion in that case, which affirmed the power of voters to decide sensitive issues, as a key point in favor of the voter-approved gay-marriage bans now being challenged.\n\nBursch, 42, now is in private practice at the Warner, Norcross and Judd law firm in Grand Rapids, Michigan. The firm said it is playing no role in Bursch\u2019s argument in defense of state same-sex marriage bans.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Same-sex marriage pioneer among lawyers for high court cases", "title": "Same-sex marriage pioneer among lawyers for high court cases", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Same-sex marriage pioneer among lawyers for high court cases", "title": "Same-sex marriage pioneer among lawyers for high court cases", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/04/25/same_sex_marriage_pioneer_among_lawyers_for_high_court_cases/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/supreme-court-gay-marriage-advocates.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Same-sex marriage pioneer among lawyers for high court cases", "title": "Same-sex marriage pioneer among lawyers for high court cases", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/supreme-court-gay-marriage-advocates.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Mark Sherman", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcd11\"", "article_summary": "Topics: From the Wires, News, Politics NewsWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Five lawyers will take turns at the Supreme Court lectern Tuesday for the highly anticipated and extended arguments over same-sex marriage.\nThe firm said it is playing no role in Bursch\u2019s argument in defense of state same-sex marriage bans.\nThe 53-year-old has been at the forefront of the legal fight for gay rights, including same-sex marriage, for more than two decades.\nShe hopes her next argument is the last time same-sex marriage is tested in court.\n___Bursch made a Supreme Court name for himself as Michigan\u2019s solicitor general, arguing eight cases at the high court in just over two years."}
