Cory Booker, D-N.J., and Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, states. \u201cDiscrimination has no place in our financial system. We believe it is appropriate and necessary for the bureau to continue this work, and urge the bureau to do so.\u201d\n\nThe letter, a copy of which is below, was provided to The Daily Signal by a Republican staffer. According to the document\u2019s metadata, the author is Chris Kukla from Self-Help Credit Union. The Daily Signal has not been able to independently verify that the Microsoft Word document received was the original document.\n\nBooker\u2019s office says the letter \u201cremains a draft.\u201d Brown\u2019s office referred The Daily Signal to the Senate Banking Committee, which did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nKukla is a member of the CFPB\u2019s Consumer Advisory Board and also serves as a senior vice president at the Center for Responsible Lending. North Carolina-based Self-Help Credit Union created the Center for Responsible Lending in 2002 to fight \u201cabusive financial practices.\u201d\n\nAccording to Kukla\u2019s bio, he leads the Center for Responsible Lending\u2019s work on auto lending issues. The group has been accused in the past by Politico of having \u201ccozy ties\u201d with the CFPB.\n\nSam Gifford, a CFPB spokesman, told The Daily Signal: \u201cMembers of the CFPB\u2019s advisory boards and councils are not CFPB employees, and do not represent the views of the bureau.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Signal reached out to Kukla to confirm that he authored the letter, but Kukla did not respond to the request for comment.\n\nThe Republican staffer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the situation raises alarming concerns. \u201cCRL must really stand for the Center for Rented Letterwriters,\u201d he said, adding:\n\nSenators should probably know before they sign on that this letter was written by someone whose organization played a big role in the subprime mortgage crisis, which makes its cozy relationship with the CFPB all the more troubling. The CFPB\u2019s deputy director was even caught saying he was having \u2018withdrawal pains\u2019 from not meeting with CRL often enough. All of this raises even more questions about the CFPB\u2019s attack on auto lending, which has already been exposed as being based on nothing more than junk science.\n\nIn 2015, the CFPB came under fire for publishing just such \u201cjunk science.\u201d\n\nA report by the House Financial Services Committee, \u201cUnsafe at Any Bureaucracy: CFPB Junk Science and Indirect Auto Lending,\u201d found internal documents showing CFPB employees discussing the statistical methods used to allege racial discrimination in the auto lending industry. Those employees said the methods were \u201cprone to significant error.\u201d\n\nCritics of the CFPB believe the letter in question was an attempt to change the narrative after the House committee spotlighted the flawed evidence.\n\n\u201cThis whole episode underscores the blatant political nature of the CFPB,\u201d said Norbert Michel, an expert in financial regulation at The Heritage Foundation. \u201cThe House Financial Services Committee exposed the bureau for basing its claims regarding auto lending discrimination on little more than guesswork, so they run to their friends in the Senate for political cover.\u201d\n\nMonique Waters, spokeswoman for Booker, said the letter was only a \u201cdraft\u201d and its content comes from \u201ca variety\u201d of sources.\n\n\u201cMany people share a commitment to eliminating discrimination wherever it occurs,\u201d Waters said. \u201cThe draft letter that was circulated supporting action to crack down on discriminatory auto lending practices is the product of input from a variety of organizations, stakeholders, and Senate offices. The letter also remains a draft, and the current version differs from the version that was circulated in the Senate last week.\u201d\n\nThis story was updated with additional information about the letter\u2019s origins.
