It decided to jump into Alabama and other states for the second year, and it plans to offer policies in all 67 Alabama counties, regulators said.\n\nWhile prices have not yet been released, United Healthcare spokeswoman Tracey Lempner said the company expects \u201cto have a competitive product available for Alabama consumers that will be valuable in terms of quality, access, affordability, innovative design and service excellence.\u201d\n\nIn the first year, Alabama\u2019s largest health insurance provider, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Alabama, was the only company offering plans in all 67 counties. It will be back for the second year in all counties. Humana offered policies the first year in Jefferson, Shelby and Madison counties and will do the same for the second year, said Mark Fowler, spokesman for the state Insurance Department.\n\nThe state Insurance Department doesn\u2019t operate the exchange, but reviews the policies to make sure they comply with Alabama regulations.\n\nThe sign-up period for the second year opens Nov. 15 and closes Feb. 15. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said information about plans and estimated prices will be available in early November on the federal website.\n\nIn the first year of the program, Alabama had the least competition of any insurance marketplace in the nation because consumers in 64 counties had only one company offering plans. The increased competition \u201cis definitely going to be to the consumers\u2019 advantage,\u201d said Jim Carnes, spokesman for Alabama Arise. The Montgomery-based group that advocates for low-income Alabamians.\n\nBlue Cross spokeswoman Koko Mackin said, \u201cWe welcome competition, which is good for Alabamians.\u201d\n\nThe first year of the exchange started off slowly due to problems with the federal website, but picked up significantly toward the end of the enrollment period. The Department of Health and Human Services reported 97,870 selected a plan. The department did not report how many paid their premiums, but Blue Cross, which sold the bulk of the policies in Alabama, said 80 percent paid their first month\u2019s premium and 72 percent continue to pay their monthly premiums.\n\nIn addition to the nearly 98,000 who selected a plan, another 22,564 Alabamians who inquired about the insurance marketplace found out they or their children qualified for Medicaid or Alabama\u2019s Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program.\n\nCarnes said he\u2019s hopeful enrollment will double in the second year.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a stretch of time where people have heard their friends and relatives talk about getting health insurance. That\u2019s the most powerful story of all,\u201d he said.\n\nThe federal government operates the health insurance marketplace in Alabama because Gov. Robert Bentley decided in 2012 not to start a state-run exchange and cited costs as the reason.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nCopyright 2016 Associated Press. All rights reserved.
