A re\u00adcent CNN poll re\u00adpor\u00adted 69 per\u00adcent of Amer\u00adic\u00adans think con\u00adgres\u00adsion\u00adal Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans are \u201cact\u00ading like spoiled chil\u00addren.\u201d Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans in Con\u00adgress hit new lows in a re\u00adcent Quin\u00adnipi\u00adac Uni\u00adversity sur\u00advey that looked at ap\u00adprov\u00adal rat\u00ading and a gen\u00ader\u00adic match-up against a Demo\u00adcrat\u00adic can\u00addid\u00adate.\n\nThe Demo\u00adcrat\u00adic Party and Pres\u00adid\u00adent Obama also are los\u00ading ground, but sur\u00advey after sur\u00advey shows Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans get\u00adting the li\u00adon\u2019s share of the blame.\n\nEven Cuc\u00adcinelli, who as the state at\u00adtor\u00adney gen\u00ader\u00adal cru\u00adsaded to re\u00adpeal the health care law, has found him\u00adself do\u00ading dam\u00adage con\u00adtrol over the shut\u00addown. He\u2019s called for mem\u00adbers of Con\u00adgress to de\u00adcline paychecks and for fur\u00adloughed work\u00aders to get paid. He also aired a ra\u00addio spot de\u00adclar\u00ading he \u201cop\u00adposes a gov\u00adern\u00adment shut\u00addown\u201d and made sure he was not pho\u00adto\u00adgraphed at a re\u00adcent event with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, whose 21-hour speech on the Sen\u00adate floor pre\u00adcip\u00adit\u00adated the budget im\u00adpasse.\n\nIt isn\u2019t help\u00ading, said Quentin Kidd, dir\u00adect\u00ador of the Wason Cen\u00adter for Pub\u00adlic Policy at Chris\u00adtoph\u00ader New\u00adport Uni\u00adversity, which found McAul\u00adiffe lead\u00ading Cuc\u00adcinelli by nine points in a new poll. More than one out of 10 Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans who cite the state\u2019s busi\u00adness cli\u00admate is their biggest con\u00adcern say they won\u2019t vote for Cuc\u00adcinelli.\n\n\u201cI think the shut\u00addown does hurt Cuc\u00adcinelli be\u00adcause it\u2019s con\u00adsist\u00adent with a lar\u00adger nar\u00adrat\u00adive that McAul\u00adiffe has en\u00adcour\u00adaged, which is that he wants to force his views on people,\u201d Kidd said. \u201cEven though Cruz didn\u2019t stand on stage with Cuc\u00adcinelli, the cov\u00ader\u00adage linked Cuc\u00adcinelli\u2019s cam\u00adpaign to what\u2019s go\u00ading on in Wash\u00ading\u00adton in a way that con\u00adfirms some people\u2019s sus\u00adpi\u00adcions about him.\u201d\n\nThe shut\u00addown is also cast\u00ading Con\u00adgress\u2019s few ac\u00adcom\u00adplish\u00adments this year in\u00adto sharp re\u00adlief. Law\u00admakers re\u00adnewed the Vi\u00adol\u00adence Against Wo\u00admen Act and ap\u00adproved aid to Hur\u00adricane Sandy vic\u00adtims only after over\u00adcom\u00ading fierce res\u00adist\u00adance from Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan con\u00adser\u00advat\u00adives. Slash\u00ading food stamp fund\u00ading by $40 bil\u00adlion and out\u00adlaw\u00ading abor\u00adtion after 20 weeks were among the only oth\u00ader ma\u00adjor bills that cleared the Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan-led House. As mil\u00adlions of un\u00adin\u00adsured Amer\u00adic\u00adans start sign\u00ading up un\u00adder the new health care law, the shut\u00addown looks like a lost cause that\u2019s done little to pro\u00admote Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan pri\u00ador\u00adit\u00adies of cut\u00adting fed\u00ader\u00adal spend\u00ading, re\u00adform\u00ading en\u00adti\u00adtle\u00adment pro\u00adgrams, and re\u00addu\u00adcing the na\u00adtion\u00adal debt.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s im\u00adper\u00adat\u00adive for Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans in Wash\u00ading\u00adton to talk more about what we\u2019re for,\u201d said Ed Gillespie, a former chair\u00adman of the Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan Na\u00adtion\u00adal Com\u00admit\u00adtee. \u201cGiv\u00ading voice to an\u00adger and frus\u00adtra\u00adtion helps en\u00ader\u00adgize our core voters, but it doesn\u2019t en\u00ader\u00adgize voters in the middle who are go\u00ading to re\u00adspond more to hope and op\u00adtim\u00adism than to talk of de\u00adfund\u00ading, re\u00adpeal\u00ading and block\u00ading things.\u201d\n\nGillespie now leads the Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan State Lead\u00ader\u00adship Com\u00admit\u00adtee, which aims to re\u00adcruit hun\u00addreds of minor\u00adity and fe\u00admale can\u00addid\u00adates by 2014. On Tues\u00adday, the RSLC an\u00adnounced that one of the most prom\u00adin\u00adent His\u00adpan\u00adic Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans in the coun\u00adtry, former Pu\u00aderto Rico Gov.

The RNC hired a former Face\u00adbook en\u00adgin\u00adeer as its chief tech\u00adno\u00adlogy of\u00adficer and opened a Sil\u00adic\u00adon Val\u00adley of\u00adfice.
