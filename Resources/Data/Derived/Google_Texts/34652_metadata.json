That \"circuit split\" made a Supreme Court review more likely.\n\nThe Supreme Court agreed to hear two cases involving for-profit corporations. Among the plaintiffs is Hobby Lobby, Inc. a nationwide chain of about 500 arts and crafts stores.\n\nDavid Green and his family are the owners and say their Christian beliefs clash with parts of the law's mandates for comprehensive coverage.\n\nThey say some of the drugs that would be provided prevent human embryos from being implanted in a woman's womb, which the Greens equate to abortion.\n\nThe privately held company does not object to funding other forms of contraception -- such as condoms and diaphragms -- for their roughly 13,000 employees, which Hobby Lobby says represent a variety of faiths.\n\nCompanies that refuse to provide the coverage could be fined up to $1.3 million daily.\n\nKyle Duncan, general counsel of the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty and lead lawyer for Hobby Lobby, called the Supreme Court decision to hear the case a \"major step\" for the Greens and their business, and \"an important fight for Americans' religious liberty.\"\n\nThe White House said on Tuesday that it believes a requirement on contraceptives is \"lawful and essential to women's health.\"\n\nThe White House added that it is \"confident the Supreme Court will agree.\"\n\nThe Obama administration has defended the law and federal officials say they have already created rules exempting certain nonprofits and religiously affiliated organizations from the contraceptives requirements. In those cases, women would receive coverage from another company at no cost.\n\nThe Supreme Court was asked to take up the issue by a private Christian university in Virginia but the court, without explanation, decided not to hear that appeal.\n\nThe law's supporters say it does not require individual company owners to personally provide coverage they might object, but instead places that responsibility on the corporate entity.\n\nA key issue for the justices will be interpreting the 1993 federal law known as the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Can companies, churches, and universities be included, or do the protections apply only to \"persons?\"\n\nThe botched rollout of HealthCare.gov, the federal Obamacare website, has become a political flashpoint along with other issues that Republicans say proves the law is unworkable.\n\nThe cases accepted were Sebelius v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. (13-354); and Conestoga Wood Specialties Corp. v. Sebelius (13-356).", "article_metadata": {"description": "The fight over implementing parts of the health care reform law could soon move to the U.S. Supreme Court", "pubdate": "2013-11-26T05:07:26Z", "author": "By Bill Mears, CNN Supreme Court Producer", "og": {"site_name": "CNN", "description": "The fight over implementing parts of the health care reform law could soon move to the U.S. Supreme Court", "pubdate": "2013-11-26T05:07:26Z", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2013/11/26/politics/obamacare-court/index.html", "image": "http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.e/img/4.0/logos/cnn_logo_social.jpg", "type": "article"}, "section": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 80401312489}, "thumbnail": "http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.e/img/4.0/logos/cnn_logo_social.jpg", "source": "CNN", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.cnn.com/2013/11/26/politics/obamacare-court/index.html"}, "keywords": "politics, Supreme Court to take up Obamacare contraception case - CNNPolitics.com", "lastmod": "2013-11-27T03:42:56Z", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbec9\"", "article_summary": "The Supreme Court was asked to take up the issue by a private Christian university in Virginia but the court, without explanation, decided not to hear that appeal.\nThe White House added that it is \"confident the Supreme Court will agree.\"\nThe Supreme Court agreed to hear two cases involving for-profit corporations.\nThat \"circuit split\" made a Supreme Court review more likely.\nThe cases accepted were Sebelius v.
