You don\u2019t speak Korean.\u201d\n\nBut George Constanza\u2019s father Frank does, and so Elaine makes him go to the nail salon with her. Once there, Frank confirms her worst fears: Yes, the manicurists had been saying mean things about her. And about him. Because his feet smell.\n\nWhen minor characters who are also ethnic minorities start talking among themselves in their native tongues, they sometimes take advantage of their invisibility to say things. Sometimes they break the Fourth Wall and start ranting about the movie director. Sometimes, they spout random obscenities or natter about their lousy lunch. It\u2019s all in not-English, so whatever they say doesn\u2019t matter! And the actual translations of their lines can be a secret source of hilarity in films where actors are instructed to use a Gratuitous Foreign Language (GFL) in order to make a scene sound more authentic. When some Native Americans cast in Westerns were told to speak their own language to add some authenticity, these actors took the opportunity to crudely editorialize about their director, which allegedly resulted in Native American audiences (in)explicably cracking up laughing during scenes that were meant to be dramatic.\n\nThese unscripted speeches are today\u2019s version of the subversive marginalia that popped up in medieval manuscripts. Before the invention of the printing press, small armies of monks used to spend their lives copying the Bible by hand. Just one book, always the same story. After a century or so of this tedium, some monks started doodling in the margins, creating bawdy scenarios such as naked people running around doing naughty things. Polite readers ignored them, but loads of medieval scholars now think they\u2019re the best part. Similarly, when Gratuitous Foreign Languages show up in movies, they usually have nothing to do with the main plot but are often very funny. And, depending on your perspective, they can totally rescue a lousy film.\n\nJust to be clear, GFLs are not to be confused with the Accidentally Mistranslated Subtitle, the Deliberately Mistranslated Subtitle or the clever use of gibberish. Tarzan spoke gibberish. Minions speak gibberish. GFLs are living foreign languages inserted into dialogues that remain untranslated because they\u2019re typically happening in the background. In order to catch them, you not only have to speak the language but must pay close attention with your ears.\n\n1. \u201cA Fish Called Wanda,\u201d 1988. In this award-winning comedy, the GFL is turned into a deliberate running joke. American beauty Wanda (Jamie Lee Curtis) is driven to gnash her teeth in horny desperation by the sound of foreign languages, but she has no idea what the words mean. Lunkhead Otto seduces her by rattling off the names of foods and standard tourist phrases in Italian: \u201cOsso bucco milanese con piselli!\u2026 formaggio, spinaci! (Milanese osso bucco with peas. Cheese, spinach);\u2026\u00e8 molto pericoloso signorina, molto pericoloso (it\u2019s very dangerous, lady, very dangerous); Dov\u2019\u00e9 la farmacia (Where\u2019s the drugstore?); Dov\u2019\u00e9 la fontana di Trevi? (Where\u2019s the Trevi Fountain?); Per cominciare due insalate verde (two green salads to start); Ecco l\u2019uomo (the man\u2019s here); Due cupole grande della cattedrale di Milano (Two great domes of the Milan cathedral); Dov\u2019\u00e9 il Vaticano? (Where\u2019s the Vatican)?\u201d In the context of his seduction, these seemingly random phrases are also double entendres, adding another layer of fun to this scene.\n\nBy contrast, when Wanda asks shy British barrister Archie (played by John Cleese) \u201cDo you speak Italian?\u201d he replies: \u201cI am Italian! Sono italiano in spirito. Ma ho sposata una donna che preferisce lavorare in giardino piuttosto che fare l\u2019amore appassionato. Uno sbaglio grande! But it\u2019s such an ugly language. How about\u2026 Russian?\u201d The untranslated bit allows Archie to complain about his wife: \u201cI\u2019m Italian in spirit! But I married a woman who\u2019d rather work in the garden than make passionate love.
