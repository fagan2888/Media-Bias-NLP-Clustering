The Pioneers (23-13-2) on Sunday were given the East Regional\u2019s No. 2 seed, and will play the No. 3 Eagles (21-13-3) on Saturday at 1 p.m. MDT in Providence, R.I., which is 51 miles southwest of Boston.\n\nMiami (Ohio) is the regional\u2019s No. 1 seed, and the RedHawks (25-13-1) will play fourth-seeded Providence (22-13-2), which is the No. 15 overall seed with home-ice advantage. Saturday\u2019s winners will meet Sunday for a berth in the Frozen Four at Boston\u2019s TD Garden April 9-11.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really good region,\u201d DU coach Jim Montgomery said. \u201cBut when we play our brand of hockey we\u2019re tough to beat.\u201d\n\nA year ago, at the Northeast Regional in Worcester, Mass., Boston College pummeled DU 6-2 less than a week after the Pioneers won the inaugural National Collegiate Hockey Conference tournament. Hobey Baker Award-winning forward Johnny Gaudreau had three goals and six points for BC. Gaudreau now plays for the Calgary Flames and leads NHL rookies in scoring.\n\nDU and BC split a nonconference series Oct. 31 and Nov. 1 in Denver this season. The Eagles won 2-1 in regulation before the Pioneers won 2-1 in overtime.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve played them twice but they\u2019re a much different team than they were last fall,\u201d Montgomery said of the Eagles, who tied Providence for second in Hockey East before losing a three-game conference playoff series to Vermont and failing to make it to the Hockey East finals. \u201cThey\u2019ve gotten better but we\u2019ve gotten exponentially better.\u201d\n\nBC, which is seeded 11th overall, will meet Denver after nearly a two-week break.\n\nDU is one of six NCHC teams in the 16-team NCAA Tournament. The eight-team NCHC has six teams among the country\u2019s top 12 in the final PairWise Rankings (PWR).\n\nThe NCHC has teams in all four regionals, including two in the East (Miami, Denver) and the West (No. 1 North Dakota, No. 2 Minnesota-Duluth). Miami and Denver finished 4-5 in the PWR, setting up a possible rematch of Friday\u2019s NCHC semifinal game in Minneapolis, in which the RedHawks won 6-3.\n\nDU bounced back by beating North Dakota 5-1 in Sunday\u2019s NCHC consolation game.\n\nMontgomery feared that his team was not prepared to play Miami on Friday.\n\n\u201cLast week we were practicing at three-quarter sweep and it reminded me of how we went into the BC game last year after winning the NCHC,\u201d he said. \u201cHopefully it\u2019s a lesson that we learned and we won\u2019t have to go through again.\u201d\n\nMiami might face Providence without 20-goal scorers Blake Coleman and Riley Barber. Coleman, who had a hat trick in Saturday\u2019s 3-2 NCHC championship-game victory over St. Cloud State, will serve a one-game suspension as a misconduct-accumulation penalty. Barber has an undisclosed injury and is questionable.\n\nTwo former DU assistant coaches will be on the benches at the regional. Miami head coach Rico Blasi and Providence assistant coach Steve Miller worked under George Gwozdecky at Denver, and Miller stayed on at DU under Montgomery midway through last season.\n\nMiller recruited and coached the majority of the Pioneers.\n\nMike Chambers: mchambers@denverpost.com or twitter.com/mikechambers\n\nMobile users can view the 2015 bracket here.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "DU hockey to play Boston College in NCAA Tournament opener", "title": "DU hockey to play Boston College in NCAA Tournament opener", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/03/22/du-hockey-to-play-boston-college-in-ncaa-tournament-opener/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150322__SP13HKCDU_2JL0856xp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150322__SP13HKCDU_2JL0856xp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-22T10:50:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-25T00:46:49+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "NCAA hockey, University of Denver"}, "article_summary": "The NCHC has teams in all four regionals, including two in the East (Miami, Denver) and the West (No.\nDU is one of six NCHC teams in the 16-team NCAA Tournament.\nMontgomery feared that his team was not prepared to play Miami on Friday.\nThe seven-time NCAA champion University of Denver will again open hockey\u2019s big dance against Boston College, which has won five national crowns.\n1 seed, and the RedHawks (25-13-1) will play fourth-seeded Providence (22-13-2), which is the No."}
