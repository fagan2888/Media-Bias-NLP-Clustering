DeMarcus Ware is one of the best pass rushers in NFL history, and now he’s a Bronco. You’d think he’d prefer to play against immobile, pocket passers like his own Peyton Manning or Tom Brady. But as it turns out, Ware likes playing against the scramblers.

Why? Because Ware loves the chase. And he has the speed for it. He showed his pass-rush speed Thursday night as three times he ran after Seattle quarterback Russell Wilson. Ware caught Wilson once for a 1-yard sack and hurried him the other two times.

“Think about it, I’ve been playing a long time against quarterbacks who can run,” said Ware, a former Dallas Cowboy who played in the NFC East Division. “One of them being Michael Vick. Then you’ve got RG III. That’s four games out of the season where you’re going to be chasing somebody. The majority of the quarterbacks in the NFC, they can run. You get used it. You figure out how to cage-rush them. I like it.”

Wilson has some nifty, back-tracking, escape moves. When he started to scramble away from pressure in the Super Bowl, the Broncos didn’t have anybody who can chase him down. Ware was able to close.

“You have to have a relentless rush against guys that can run,” said Ware, whose 117.0 career sacks already ranks 18th all-time. “Because if you stop the rush they’ll run somewhere else just to string plays out.”
