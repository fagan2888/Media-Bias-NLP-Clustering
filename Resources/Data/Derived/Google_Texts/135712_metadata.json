(Photo: AP)\n\nSpinning the data\n\nE.J. Dionne\u2019s recent piece praised President Obama for politicizing the Oregon mass shooting. As with every snake oil salesman, Obama knows how to take advantage of a crowd \u2014 even while they are mourning. His political grandstanding peddled more of his worn out political wares such as, \u201cThe majority of Americans want stricter gun laws.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not true. Gallup polls, for one, show the majority of Americans want them left alone or weakened.\n\n\u201cWe know that states with the most gun laws tend to have the fewest murders.\u201d That\u2019s also not true.\n\nIn fact, the opposite has been proven true, repeatedly.\n\nThe 4 states with the lowest violent crime rates in the nation are all right-to-carry states. The 10 states with the highest crime rates have the most restrictive gun laws. For example, Illinois has some of the toughest gun laws in the country, yet Chicago has seen 6,000 shootings and 1,679 murders since 2012 \u2013 way above the national average. Why didn\u2019t Obama go there and give his speech?\n\nAllan Carroll, La Quinta\n\nDemocrats and Republicans\n\nJonathan Gruber, one of the chief architects of Obamacare, was caught being unusually honest in a series of embarrassing videos that Democrats wish would go away. President Obama, Nancy Pelosi and top Dems tried the old, \u201cJonathan who?\u201d routine only to have more videos come out showing each of them praising him.\n\nHe attributed the passing of Obamacare to the \u201cstupidity of the American voters\u201d and deliberately deceptive wording. To be clear, he was not talking about Republicans, who used logic instead of emotion.\n\nRepublicans are called \u201cracists,\u201d even though Ben Carson, an African-American, holds the top favorability rating. Republicans are at \u201cwar with women\u201d, even though a woman, Carly Fiorina holds a top spot in popularity with conservatives. And Republicans are supposedly \u201canti-immigrant\u201d even though Marco Rubio is a leading contender.\n\nThese false narratives are very effective for the low-information voters.\n\nRepublicans are blamed for there being no comprehensive immigration laws or gun control even though Obama could have passed both in his first two years when Democratics had total control.\n\nRon Greenip, Palm Springs\n\nKors has great track record\n\nI am voting for Geoff Kors for City Council. Everyone I spoke to who watched the Candidate Forum on Oct. 15 was struck by his intelligence and command of the issues. But, he is so much more \u2013 he is a man of integrity, principle, fairness and uncommon humanity.\n\nGeoff will be a unifying force for progress in our city. Geoff Kors has a proven track record of building consensus to get things done.\n\nLisa Middleton, Palm Springs\n\nWe know Moon all too well\n\nWe served on the Measure J Commission with Rob Moon for three years. Not a single Measure J Commissioner is endorsing him for mayor.\n\nDo not be deceived by Rob Moon. He tries to sell himself as a leader, but when actually working with him, it is clear \u2013 his approach is command and control and is not collaborative in any way!\n\nRob\u2019s leadership style is intimidation, both with commissioners and city staff. He did not work productively with others and he expected to get his way with anger, tantrums, threats, and humiliation. When he did not get his way, he was known to stomp out of meetings.\n\nRecently, Rob quit the Measure J Commission. Evidently, he fails to understand the purpose of the Measure J Commission and the work necessary to fulfill its mission to benefit our community.\n\nRob is a shrewd and calculating guy and clearly has the verbal skills to convince people he is a leader. But don\u2019t be fooled!\n\nRob Moon is neither the kind of leader, nor the kind of person, our community deserves as our next mayor.\n\nChristine Hammond and Aftab Dada, Measure J commissioners\n\nRead or Share this story: http://desert.sn/1LEzrJp", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Reader submitted Desert Sun letters to the editor for Oct. 19, 2015.", "og": {"site_name": "Desert Sun", "description": "Reader submitted Desert Sun letters to the editor for Oct. 19, 2015.", "title": "Desert Sun letters to the editor for Oct. 19, 2015", "url": "http://www.desertsun.com/story/opinion/readers/2015/10/18/desert-sun-letters-editor/74086774/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/desertsun.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Reader submitted Desert Sun letters to the editor for Oct. 19, 2015.", "title": "Desert Sun letters to the editor for Oct. 19, 2015", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c9271c353bb679a223d216a4e4f52c96e39b3bf2/c=746-0-3543-2797&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/10/16/PalmSprings/B9319311873Z.1_20151016201001_000_GGHC92GNI.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@mydesert", "site": "@mydesert", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600074187", "fb": {"app_id": 116853348383382}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "Rob Moon is neither the kind of leader, nor the kind of person, our community deserves as our next mayor.\nLisa Middleton, Palm SpringsWe know Moon all too wellWe served on the Measure J Commission with Rob Moon for three years.\n\u201cWe know that states with the most gun laws tend to have the fewest murders.\u201d That\u2019s also not true.\nChristine Hammond and Aftab Dada, Measure J commissionersRead or Share this story: http://desert.sn/1LEzrJp\nEvidently, he fails to understand the purpose of the Measure J Commission and the work necessary to fulfill its mission to benefit our community."}
