Since it\u2019s an Obama deal, the odds are the United States is gonna take it in the shorts, as we have on so much of the Obama agenda, both domestic and foreign policy. One of the things, and there are many, and by the way, this \u2014 it hasn\u2019t changed. They would not allow any of this deal to be made public. Members of Congress, House and Senate, had to go to a private room to read it. They were not allowed to take any notes. Well, they could take notes. They couldn\u2019t leave with their notes. They were not allowed to tell anybody what they read.\u201d\n\nRush added, \u201cJeff Sessions had a massive op-ed piece and floor speech in the Senate about this. It\u2019s a disaster, just on that basis alone. It\u2019s not how things happen in this country. One of the things, Cybercast News Service just posted a story that the trade deal\u2026will eliminate, eliminate trade barriers with North Vietnam \u2014 well, Vietnam. Vietnam is a communist regime. It\u2019s running a $24.9 billion trade deficit with the US, and the Trans-Pacific Partnership that Obama is negotiating with 11 other nations seeks to eliminate both tariff and non-tariff trade barriers with these countries.\u201d\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett", "article_metadata": {"description": "Talk radio host Rush Limbaugh argued that \"odds are the United States is gonna take it in the shorts\" on TPA and TPP on Friday.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Talk radio host Rush Limbaugh argued that \"odds are the United States is gonna take it in the shorts\" on TPA and TPP on Friday.", "title": "Rush: 'Odds Are' US Will 'Take It In the Shorts' With Trade Deal - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 475, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/02/Rush-211-Thumbnail.jpg", "height": 356}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/05/25/rush-odds-are-us-will-take-it-in-the-shorts-with-trade-deal/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Talk radio host Rush Limbaugh argued that \"odds are the United States is gonna take it in the shorts\" on TPA and TPP on Friday.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/02/Rush-211-Thumbnail.jpg", "title": "Rush: 'Odds Are' US Will 'Take It In the Shorts' With Trade Deal - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Obamatrade, Rush Limbaugh, TPA, TPP,Breitbart TV, Economics,Rush", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Breitbart TV", "tag": "TPP", "published_time": "2015-05-25T17:12:12-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV,Economics"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe29fd\"", "article_summary": "One of the things, Cybercast News Service just posted a story that the trade deal\u2026will eliminate, eliminate trade barriers with North Vietnam \u2014 well, Vietnam.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERTalk radio host Rush Limbaugh argued that \u201codds are the United States is gonna take it in the shorts\u201d on TPA and TPP on Friday.\nSince it\u2019s an Obama deal, the odds are the United States is gonna take it in the shorts, as we have on so much of the Obama agenda, both domestic and foreign policy.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERRush, after agreeing with a caller that there is a large deal hypocrisy on the part of Democrats like Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren complaining about the administration\u2019s lack of trade transparency while supporting its opaqueness on Obamacare stated, \u201cSince it\u2019s an Obama deal, the odds are it isn\u2019t good.\nThey would not allow any of this deal to be made public."}
