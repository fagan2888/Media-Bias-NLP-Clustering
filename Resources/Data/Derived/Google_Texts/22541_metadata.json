The company Mayor LaGuardia famously dubbed the \u201cpeople\u2019s opera\u201d\u2014from the New York Mets to the Met Opera\u2019s Yankees\u2014was dead after 70 years of dramatic service. Gifted with a predictable demise, the best a host of death-watching reporters could devise was a \u201cFat Lady Sings\u201d riff. Not even NPR was immune from this deficiency of wit and wisdom. The City Opera ended not with a whimper but a guffaw: a shrug of the shoulders to an institution many of us knew little of and few cared much about.\n\nIt\u2019s that easy to lose a cultural institution; the mourning period was short lived at any rate. Because did we really need another major opera company when we already have the Met? It\u2019s a question about vitality, richness, diversity\u2014you could just as well ask: Did we need the dodo? And aren\u2019t they similar questions? In fact, aren\u2019t they asking the same questions: What do we need? What are we willing to lose?\n\nBecause we can lose a river dolphin species, we\u2019re losing hundreds of frog species\u2014and now we\u2019ve lost the City Opera. Life will move on and so will we, no worse for the wear (at least so it seems). The end of the opera and the extinction of a species are oddly related. It\u2019s a question, ultimately, about disposability and conservation. Save the whales! Save the opera?\n\nThe sad truth is that much of the City Opera\u2019s fall was self-inflicted. Years of fatal mismanagement, bad decisions\u2014cancelling the 2008-9 season among the worst\u2014and diminishing sales\u2014down 87 percent in 2011-12 from 2005-06\u2014impoverished the company.\n\nIt was a slow death, made all the more worse by the fact that no rescue seemed to be coming\u2014or even felt deserved. And if there was a recovery effort, it was the equivalent of dispatching a single lifeboat to save all aboard the Titanic. In this case, that feeble lifeboat was a flop Kickstarter campaign that only managed to raise a third of its one million dollar goal\u2014just a fragment of the City Opera\u2019s larger shortfall of $7 million! Moreover, no generous-hearted philanthropist swooped in with a big check. In fact, according to the New York Times, the exact opposite occurred. In a September meeting following the opening of Anna Nicole, a well-reviewed opera on the dramatic life of the late human train wreck, the City Opera sat down with David Koch, a longstanding benefactor with exceptionally deep pockets, and talked donations. But when asked \u201cif he could make further gifts to save the company, Mr. Koch demurred, telling [the City Opera] that the Marshall family might be less than pleased\u201d were he to do so. The Marshalls are the heirs of the late oil magnate, J. Howard Marshall II, once a close business partner of Koch\u2019s\u2014though you probably know him better as Anna Nicole Smith\u2019s geriatric lover. The Marshall family never quite warmed to Anna Nicole, however, and it seems this dislike extended to her operatic likeness as well.\n\n\u201cThe [City Opera] company could sell out 500-seat theaters and get raves in every paper and still not convince people to give it the kind of support that could ensure its future,\u201d Zachary Woolfe presciently wrote in 2011 in the Observer. \u201cIn that case, New York, like Minneapolis, will be a one-opera town.\u201d And so it has become.\n\nAre we to share in the blame for the opera\u2019s decline, then? Maybe, but we\u2019re certainly not the Brutus of the City Opera\u2019s death. If anything we\u2019re more like that other Brutus\u2014the one who delivered the third blow. Caesar was already dying: we just sped up the process.\n\nAt the same time, there is something about our culture, especially my generation\u2014us manifold millennials\u2014that is existentially opposed to opera, and uncomfortable with what it says and does with emotions. Certainly the opera can appear haughty, supremely theatrical, perhaps even boring. It is a social space heaving with heavy breasts, shrill sopranos, bellowing altos, and nearly everyone exceedingly well dressed and behaved. But let\u2019s put the opera into perspective\u2014how is Broadway, a terrifically popular pastime, any more affordable, laid back, or inviting? Tickets to the opera can be found for $25 or $30 a head, and many companies offer student discounts and rush tickets. A velvet, formal rope prevails in opera, but it\u2019s one that can easily be crossed\u2014and yet, once on the other side, it can be disorienting and grand.", "article_metadata": {"description": "After 70 years, the company's filing for chapter 11.
