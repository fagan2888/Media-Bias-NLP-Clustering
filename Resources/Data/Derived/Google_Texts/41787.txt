Last year and this year will look much like 2012 when it comes to nonprofit executive compensation, consultants say.



Increases in base pay in 2013 and into 2014 continued to be in the 3 percent range, and the same is projected for 2015, said Ed Steinhoff, Ann Arbor-based managing director at Pearl Meyer & Partners LLC.



The use of bonuses rather than base pay to increase the total compensation of nonprofit CEOs also has continued, compensation experts said.
