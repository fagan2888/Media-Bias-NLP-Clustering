Charlotte County Sheriff's Deputies arrested 29-year-old Christopher Hook at his Port Charlotte home Thursday on 21 counts of child molestation.

Our crews spoke to his mother this afternoon; she says her family is shocked and devastated by the allegations. She calls them "untrue."

Neighbors learning of his arrest like Rick Perlaza said, "things like that I'm sorry they're not forgivable in my book. If there are 21 counts, those are some serious, serious charges."

Perlaza added he's relieved Hook is behind bars for now since there are several children and a school in the neighborhood.

Hook is in the Charlotte County Jail on a $2,050,00 bond.

This is not his first run-in with the law in Charlotte County.

Two years ago, Hook was arrested at his home for attempted 2nd-Degree murder after he fired a gun at a man in a car.

In 2010, he was arrested for fleeing deputies at high rates of speed.

They used ground and aviation units to track him down. He was arrested and charged with fleeing to elude and reckless driving.
