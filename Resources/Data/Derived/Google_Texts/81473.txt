News of the United States reaching a nuclear deal with Iran dominated political talk shows on Sunday morning.

The historic deal, which is aimed at slowing Tehran's nuclear program, was announced Sunday. That, along with filibuster reform, was a top story on "Face the Nation," "Fox News Sunday" and "This Week."

In an interview with Congressman Kevin McCarthy, CBS News' Bob Schieffer asked if the White House strived to reach an accord in an attempt to distract attention from the botched Obamacare rollout.

"I was on airplanes this weekend, and more than one person I was talking to about this whole deal pending with Iran said, ‘This might be a diversionary tactic by an administration desperately looking for good news,'" Schieffer said. “Would you put it in that category yet?"

Speaking on "This Week," Bill Kristol called the deal "terrible," saying that it would only temporarily pause Iran's work on the country's nuclear program.

Other commentators were more optimistic. ABC News global affairs anchor Christiane Amanpour said that Iranian journalists cheered the news. "Intelligence people here and in Britain and others, who are very aware of what's going on, have told me this interim deal is a good deal," she added. "It is significant freezes and suspension by Iran for very modest, temporary sanction relief."

Fox News' Juan Williams disagreed with his fellow panelists when he said just holding talks with Iran was a "tremendous breakthrough" for the U.S. and its allies nearby.
