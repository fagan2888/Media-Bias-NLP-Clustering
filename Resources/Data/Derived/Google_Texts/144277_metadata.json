Monday night\u2019s benefit for Jon Carlton, 38, who suffered a heart attack on the summit of Esha Peak a month ago, was one of those times.\n\nLiving in a small town comes with its challenges\u2014local politics, lack of access to a dermatologist, no In \u2019n Out\u2014but the benefits far outweigh the sacrifices. If you are good to your community, which Jon Carlton unfailingly is, they will rush en masse to your aid should you stumble.\n\nJon and his wife, Monica Prelle, have lived in Mammoth for over fifteen years. They met on the gondola on Mammoth Mountain when Monica hopped on at Mid-Chalet one fateful day. They have worked all over town as servers, Jon as a fly fishing guide, Monica as a wine specialist and currently as a writer. They\u2019ve endeared themselves to just about everyone they\u2019ve met along the way. This was apparent on Monday at Mammoth Brewing Company when the line to purchase food (all profits of which were generously donated to the couple\u2019s recovery expenses by The Eatery\u2019s Brandon and Theresa Brocia) didn\u2019t diminish until almost 9 p.m.\n\nThe Brewer\u2019s Hall upstairs was flanked by tables of donated items from dozens of local businesses and good samaritans, all up for raffle and silent auction. There were too many contributions to possibly list all of the people who should be thanked. Friends of the couple quaffed pints, and $1 from each drink sold also went into the coffers. To say the place was packed would be a grievous understatement. The crowd listened to the reggae stylings of Eddie Wright and rocked out late-night to a performance by Bird Dog, a band in which Carlton is a member (his sweet guitar solos were sorely missed). Carlton himself even made a cameo, via video feed, to thank his friends. His wife Monica made sure to insist on a toast to ObamaCare (the Affordable Care Act), which has covered most of Carlton\u2019s medical expenses.\n\nThe couple\u2019s humility and self-sufficiency were qualities cited again and again by attendees as part of what made them so special and deserving of this outpouring of community support. Carlton embodied that High Sierra grit on the day of his heart attack\u2014he was able, with the help of his wife and the friends they were backcountry skiing with, to snowboard down the main couloir of Esha Peak, straight off of the summit, and reach medical attention. His ordeal is the stuff of mountain town legend.\n\nClick here for more", "article_metadata": {"description": "Event raises almost $16,000 for beloved local.", "generator": "NGFB 8.29.6-1/G", "author": "Rea", "og": {"site_name": "The Sheet", "description": "Event raises almost $16,000 for beloved local.", "title": "Town turns out for Carlton", "url": "http://thesheetnews.com/2016/05/06/town-turns-out-for-carlton/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://thesheetnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/The-Sheet-Icon1.jpg", "height": 1200}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "thesheetnews.com", "description": "Event raises almost $16,000 for beloved local.", "card": "summary", "title": "Town turns out for Carlton"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The Sheet News", "keywords": "news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheSheetNews", "section": "News", "published_time": "2016-05-06T08:00:57+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-05T18:22:34+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "ngfb": {"mark": "ngfb meta tags end"}}, "article_summary": "If you are good to your community, which Jon Carlton unfailingly is, they will rush en masse to your aid should you stumble.\nMonday night\u2019s benefit for Jon Carlton, 38, who suffered a heart attack on the summit of Esha Peak a month ago, was one of those times.\nHis wife Monica made sure to insist on a toast to ObamaCare (the Affordable Care Act), which has covered most of Carlton\u2019s medical expenses.\nThey have worked all over town as servers, Jon as a fly fishing guide, Monica as a wine specialist and currently as a writer.\nJon and his wife, Monica Prelle, have lived in Mammoth for over fifteen years."}
