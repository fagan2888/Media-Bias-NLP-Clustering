John Kasich\u2019s Obamacare expansion, and a heavier millstone for taxpayers stuck bearing the costs.\n\nKasich\u2019s decision to put working-age Ohioans with no kids and no disabilities on Medicaid has cost federal taxpayers more than $5 billion in less than two years.\n\nThe Ohio Department of Medicaid reported spending $394 million on Obamacare expansion in September. Ohio\u2019s Obamacare expansion has cost more than $300 million every month since December and more than $370 million every month since July.\n\nAfter just 21 months of enrollment, Obamacare expansion costs dwarf state spending on programs long recognized as the state government\u2019s basic responsibilities.\n\nBy contrast, Kasich\u2019s Office of Budget and Management reported spending $133 million on justice and public protection and $206 million on primary and secondary education in September.\n\nEven when non-General Revenue Fund spending on Obamacare expansion is excluded for the sake of an apples-to-apples comparison, Ohio spent nearly as much on Obamacare expansion as on public safety and K-12 education combined.\n\nKasich, a Republican, expanded Medicaid to bring new Obamacare funding to the state. The expansion has been rocketing past cost projections since taking effect in January 2014.\n\nBlocked by the Ohio General Assembly, Kasich went to the obscure Ohio Controlling Board for permission to spend $2.56 billion in Obamacare money for the expansion\u2019s first 18 months; in 14 months, that money had been spent.\n\nRELATED: No money, no problem for Ohio Obamacare expansion\n\nBy June, Kasich\u2019s Obamacare expansion had cost taxpayers more than $4 billion. By September, the cumulative cost of Obamacare expansion benefits in Ohio was $5.2 billion.\n\nOn the presidential campaign trail, Kasich boasts of building Ohio\u2019s rainy day fund to $2 billion in four years; at home in Ohio, his Obamacare expansion cost more than $2 billion in the past six months.\n\nObamacare expansion funding \u2014 which Kasich describes as \u201cOhio\u2019s tax dollars\u201d he is \u201cbringing back\u201d to the state \u2014 is 100 percent new federal spending until the end of 2016, providing a boost to the state budget on the shoulders of federal taxpayers.\n\nIf spending continues at its current rate, taxpayers will be on the hook for more than $4 billion in Ohio Obamacare expansion costs every year. Ohioans will have to pay a state share starting at 5 percent in 2017 \u2014 increasing to 10 percent by 2020.\n\nFree-market think tank Opportunity Ohio recently published a study estimating the state\u2019s future Obamacare expansion costs under a variety of scenarios, taking into account the possibility of federal funding cuts below the promised 90 percent.\n\nOpportunity Ohio projects Medicaid expansion will cost Ohio taxpayers $5.3 billion from 2019-26 with no changes to Obamacare, or as much as $19.9 billion if Congress cuts the federal share so expansion is funded at the same rate as traditional Medicaid.\n\nWith or without further changes to Obamacare, the law\u2019s Medicaid expansion appears certain to cost Ohioans more than advertised by the Kasich administration.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question that state taxpayers are going to be on the hook for more than we were told initially,\u201d Greg Lawson, a policy analyst for the free-market Buckeye Institute, told Ohio Watchdog.\n\nLawson said it\u2019s likely the state will cut Medicaid benefits for pregnant women, poor families, the elderly and the disabled to help pay for the cost of putting working-age adults with no kids and no disabilities onto the welfare program.\n\nIn his most recent budget, Kasich proposed cutting Medicaid eligibility for pregnant women and women with breast or cervical cancer from 200 percent of poverty to 138 percent of poverty. The General Assembly blocked the proposal.\n\n\u201cWe have to be very careful that we\u2019re not robbing Peter to pay Paul,\u201d Lawson said. \u201cIn this case, robbing the Peter who everybody supports being on Medicaid to pay for the Paul who a lot of people think doesn\u2019t need to be on Medicaid.\n\nLawson said meaningful reforms to Medicaid require flexibility President Obama\u2019s administration has refused to give. That\u2019s one reason the Buckeye Institute advised against Obamacare expansion.\n\nThe governor\u2019s office failed to respond to questions about Ohio\u2019s Obamacare expansion costs.", "article_metadata": {"description": "September brought another milestone for Ohio Gov.
