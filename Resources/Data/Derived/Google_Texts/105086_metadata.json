It\u2019s the home opener for the Crimson Tide (2-0, 1-0 SEC).\n\n\u201cI told our guys, \u2018It\u2019s not about (Alabama\u2019s) mystique or tradition, it\u2019s about measuring yourself against the best,\u201d McElwain said Monday during his weekly news conference.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think our guys will be intimidated. If anybody is scared, and I\u2019ll see that in their eyes this week, I\u2019ll leave them home.\u201d\n\nMcElwain served as Alabama\u2019s offensive coordinator for four years prior to being named CSU coach in December, 2011. Colorado State (1-2) is coming off its first victory, a 34-17 home win over FCS-level Cal Poly.\n\nMcElwain said he will take a team to Tuscaloosa, Ala., that\u2019s prepared to play.\n\n\u201cThe only reason to be scared is if you\u2019re not sure,\u201d McElwain said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s no reason to not be sure about what you\u2019re doing.\n\n\u201cSo it comes down to your preparation. It comes down to, \u2018What will we do today? What do we do in this (practice) period? And how do we prepare ourselves to put ourselves in a position to play hard and measure our abilities, and who we are and what we\u2019re all about against the best?\u2019\n\n\u201cOur approach is, \u2018Guys, who gets an opportunity to match yourself against the best? You can\u2019t do that every week'\u201d\n\nMcElwain said his team is not going to Alabama \u201cand throw a bunch of tricks\u201d at the Crimson Tide. The Rams, he explained, will be who they are.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to find out a \u2018baseline\u2019 to see where we\u2019re at,\u201d McElwain said. \u201cOur guys will see it\u2019s a special place. But let\u2019s go play. We\u2019ll measure ourselves against the best and then correct some things and then move on to the next (game).\u201d\n\nTom Kensler: , tkensler@denverpost.com or twitter.com/tomkensler", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Jim McElwain says his CSU Rams won\u2019t be intimidated at Alabama", "title": "Jim McElwain says his CSU Rams won\u2019t be intimidated at Alabama", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/09/16/jim-mcelwain-says-his-csu-rams-wont-be-intimidated-at-alabama/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130916__jim-mcelwain-csuramsp1.jpg", "height": 426}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130916__jim-mcelwain-csuramsp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-16T14:57:14+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T13:20:35+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1fb0\"", "article_summary": "FORT COLLINS \u2014 Colorado State coach Jim McElwain said his team will not be scared or intimidated Saturday when the Rams play at top-ranked Alabama.\n\u201cI told our guys, \u2018It\u2019s not about (Alabama\u2019s) mystique or tradition, it\u2019s about measuring yourself against the best,\u201d McElwain said Monday during his weekly news conference.\n\u201cThe only reason to be scared is if you\u2019re not sure,\u201d McElwain said.\nMcElwain said he will take a team to Tuscaloosa, Ala., that\u2019s prepared to play.\nYou can\u2019t do that every week'\u201dMcElwain said his team is not going to Alabama \u201cand throw a bunch of tricks\u201d at the Crimson Tide."}
