Paul made his way through the restaurant, first introducing himself to the media representatives gathered at the door, and then walking through to meet and greet the members of the crowd.\n\nThose in attendance could ask Paul questions, inquire about his opinions on issues such as the debt ceiling or the Affordable Care Act, or simply talk and share their opinions with him.\n\n\u201cI like coming to communities I haven\u2019t visited in a while,\u201d Paul said.\n\nThree Murray State seniors, Hannah Knapp, of Xenia, Ill., Dylan Gerlach, of Louisville, Ky., and Elizabeth Tartar, of Greenville, Ky., spoke with the senator about the Affordable Care Act, and what it will mean for them as they graduate college and enter the healthcare field. Tartar and Gerlach, both Biology Pre-Med majors, asked Paul why they should be doctors after the passing of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cBeing a doctor is about more than the money, it\u2019s about caring for people,\u201d Paul said. \u201cI would practice for free any day.\u201d\n\nThe three students said meeting the senator was a good experience, and they liked what he had to say about healthcare.\n\nIn addition to recent government action, Paul also shared his opinions on education. He said that he believes primary education should be decentralized, with more decision-making power given to the state and local governments. When asked about secondary education, Paul said that college is too expensive, and there aren\u2019t enough jobs for graduates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe biggest problem with college right now is the rising cost. Students are graduating with increasing loan burdens and it\u2019s hard for them to find a job, let alone a job where they make enough to pay off loans,\u201d Paul said.\n\nHe talked about the need for more jobs, so college graduates can find work, and when asked about the impact government welfare programs are having on the job search, he quickly touted statistics on the issue.\n\n\u201cIn 11 states right now, welfare pays better than a starting teachers\u2019 salary,\u201d Paul said. \u201cIn 39 states, welfare pays more than minimum wage.\u201d\n\nHe said he doesn\u2019t believe young adults don\u2019t want to work, he believes there just aren\u2019t enough jobs for them.\n\nSusan and Joe Walker, a couple from Calloway County, said that they came to Martha\u2019s Restaurant to thank Senator Paul for his efforts, and to let him know they appreciate him.\n\n\u201cPeople like him need to know they\u2019ve got support back home,\u201d Joe Walker said.\n\nSusan Walker agreed with her husband, and said she likes Paul because, \u201cHe\u2019s got common sense, and he stands up for it.\u201d The couple had no questions or concerns for the senator, they simply wanted to thank him for the work he has done in Washington.\n\nSenator Paul\u2019s meet and greet in Murray was part of a series of stops he made in the region, including Benton and Cadiz.\n\nKate Russell, Staff writer.", "article_metadata": {"template": "Fearless - Modern, Clean, & Responsive WP Magazine 1.7.3", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce47a\"", "article_summary": "Senator Paul\u2019s meet and greet in Murray was part of a series of stops he made in the region, including Benton and Cadiz.\nMartha\u2019s Restaurant was full to capacity with dozens of people wanting to meet the senator.\nRand Paul (R-Owensboro), Kentucky\u2019s junior senator to the United States Congress, met many of his Western Kentucky constituents Monday as he visited several locations in the region, including Martha\u2019s Restaurant in Murray.\nSusan and Joe Walker, a couple from Calloway County, said that they came to Martha\u2019s Restaurant to thank Senator Paul for his efforts, and to let him know they appreciate him.\n\u201cIn 39 states, welfare pays more than minimum wage.\u201dHe said he doesn\u2019t believe young adults don\u2019t want to work, he believes there just aren\u2019t enough jobs for them."}
