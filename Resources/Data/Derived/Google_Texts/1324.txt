Comcast Business on Tuesday said that it’s investing another $10 million into its Denver-area fiber network in order to sell more of its gigabit Ethernet services to business customers.

This is on top of the “billions of dollars” Comcast has already invested in networks here in Colorado, where Comcast has offered 1 to 10 Gigabit per second service to business customers since 2011, said Cindy Parsons, Comcast’s regional vice president of public relations. On the business side, Comcast competes against companies like CenturyLink and Boulder’s Zayo Group.

“This particular investment is in addition to our ongoing infrastructure investments and will enable us to reach even more commercial customers throughout the Metro Denver area,” said Parsons, pointing to features like Ethernet private lines and cloud-based phone service. “…The investment is primarily dedicated to expand our network to serve more businesses, which could include commercial grade services, including business Wi-Fi, etc.”

The latest investment is separate from Comcast’s investment in public Wi-Fi and its push to offer gigabit Internet to residential customers, she added.

Last week, Comcast announced Gigabit Pro, and plans to offer this up-to-2 gbps Internet service in Atlanta beginning in May.

As for Denver?

“We plan to roll out the service to more cities soon including Denver and will let you know when customers are eligible,” she said.

In Colorado, CenturyLink began offering gigabit service to customers in Denver this year. Longmont built its own fiber-optic pipe and now offers gigabit service to residents. Also, Google Fiber recently registered to do business in Colorado but the company said it’s not ready to add Denver to its broadband list.
