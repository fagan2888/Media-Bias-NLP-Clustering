In return, yes, women can now celebrate the opportunity to pay to care for prostates they don\u2019t have and Viagra prescriptions they probably won\u2019t need, but let\u2019s not get too far from the point in question: ACA was very, very good to Planned Parenthood.\n\n[[{\u201ctype\u201d:\u201dmedia\u201d,\u201dview_mode\u201d:\u201dmedia_large\u201d,\u201dfid\u201d:\u201d97352\u2033,\u201dattributes\u201d:{\u201calt\u201d:\u201d\u201d,\u201dclass\u201d:\u201dmedia-image\u201d,\u201dheight\u201d:\u201d194\u2033,\u201dtypeof\u201d:\u201dfoaf:Image\u201d,\u201dwidth\u201d:\u201d480\u2033}}]]\n\nIf you were wondering whether Richards is getting all teary-eyed because her supposedly non-profit organization is struggling to make ends meet because of the incredibly generous commitment they have to keeping America\u2019s women healthy and happy, well, according to a GAO report released yesterday, in response to questions from Rep. Vicki Hartzler about how much, exactly, Planned Parenthood receives from the American taxpayers, you needen\u2019t worry. Over the last three years, abortion advocacy groups including Planned Parenthood have sucked down an impressive $1.5 billion in funding from various state and Federal sources. A quick scan of the report reveals that PPOA and its affiliates received around $350 million from Federal funds and about $1.2 billion from Medicaid, which is covered by Federal and state sources. The Federal money comes from a mix of sources that include the Title X Family Planning program and the somewhat oddly named Title XX Maternal and Child Health Services program. Thank heavens Cecile Richards is in charge of health care and not the STEM program, because she\u2019d have a hard time convincing anyone that her arithmetic skills are up to par.\n\n\n\nBut Planned Parenthood and its supporters, who still believe that the clinic chain operates as nothing less than a Magical Ladyparts Castle that saves the lives of millions of women annualy, would say that all that money goes to a good place. After all, even I can agree that providing affordable, accessible healthcare that caters specifically to female needs is a good cause. No one wants to get their annual Pap smear at the same free clinic that hands out methadone to homeless junkies.\n\nBut the funny thing is, that exact argument demonstrates that the Affordable Care Act\u2019s equality provision is bogus: can someone who presides over a chain of womens\u2019 health clinics designed to handle the needs women have that go above and beyond the normal standard of care for most walk-in facilities really claim that women don\u2019t have a more complex system that requires a more tailored approach? Certainly, Planned Parenthood isn\u2019t doing a lot of pre-natal care, but even they can recognize that they exist precisely because women\u2019s medical needs are different and greater than mens\u2019. Which clearly shows why the insurance \u201cgap\u201d that supposedly \u201cpunishes\u201d women is necessary from an insurance standpoint \u2013 for an industry that exists specifically to offset the relative costs of medical care.\n\nAnd if Planned Parenthood does nothing different than any other medical care provider, why in heavens name do they need that much extra cash?\n\nCelebrating equality, at least in this case, means punishing consumers and taxpayers and co-opting the free market to fit a set of outdated ideals, in the place of helping to find real solutions to the high cost of health care that could actually help women.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 1742097289343962}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "generator": "WordPress 4.4"}, "article_summary": "Over the last three years, abortion advocacy groups including Planned Parenthood have sucked down an impressive $1.5 billion in funding from various state and Federal sources.\nAnd if Planned Parenthood does nothing different than any other medical care provider, why in heavens name do they need that much extra cash?\nCertainly, Planned Parenthood isn\u2019t doing a lot of pre-natal care, but even they can recognize that they exist precisely because women\u2019s medical needs are different and greater than mens\u2019.\nThank heavens Cecile Richards is in charge of health care and not the STEM program, because she\u2019d have a hard time convincing anyone that her arithmetic skills are up to par.\nWhich clearly shows why the insurance \u201cgap\u201d that supposedly \u201cpunishes\u201d women is necessary from an insurance standpoint \u2013 for an industry that exists specifically to offset the relative costs of medical care."}
