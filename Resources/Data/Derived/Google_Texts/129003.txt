“The Assets,” an eight-episode Cold War miniseries on ABC beginning Jan. 2, is more subtle and less immediately engaging than FX;s “The Americans,” more reality-based and less dramatically compelling than Showtime’s “Homeland.” It bears a similarity to AMC’s “Rubicon” in its slow pace. Not a brilliant effort, but worth a look.

The story of infamous traitor Aldrich Ames, the mini- travels back to the spy vs. spy Reagan era, with footage of ABC’s David Hartman and Peter Jennings as period markers, a time of shoulder pads, telex machines grinding out the latest dispatches from Moscow and panic inside the CIA.

Oddly marred by bad American accents from British actors (not to mention entirely fictional Washington, D.C., geography), “The Assets” at least has fact in its favor. The mini- is based on the book “Circle of Treason: A CIA Account of Traitor Aldrich Ames and the Men He Betrayed” by Sandy Grimes and Jeanne Vertefeuile.

Paul Rhys hasn’t quite nailed the accent as Ames but Jodie Whittaker demonstrates the best American dialect of the bunch in the role of CIA agent Sandy Grimes. This petite blonde Cold Warrior is torn between the demands of family, work and undercover assets. “You have got to compartmentalize!” her CIA boss demands. “Keep everything in your life separate.”

And she’ll do it without the bad wigs Keri Russell sports in “The Americans.”

Local note: Denver native Stuart Milligan has a role as Paul Redmond.
