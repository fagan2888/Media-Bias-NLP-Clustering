How can you be cheerful, after all, when you look at what\u2019s been happening in our lifetimes.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget the essential insight of \u201cpublic choice\u201d economics, which tells us that politicians care first and foremost about their own interests rather than the national interest. So what\u2019s their incentive to address these problems, particularly if there\u2019s some way to sweep them under the rug and let future generations bear the burden?\n\nAnd if you think I\u2019m being unduly negative about political incentives and fiscal responsibility, consider the new report from the European Commission, which found that politicians from EU member nations routinely enact budgets based on \u201crosy scenarios.\u201d As the EU Observer reported:\n\nEU governments are too optimistic about their economic prospects and their ability to control public spending, leading to them continually missing their budget targets, a European Commission paper has argued. \u2026their growth projections are 0.6 percent higher than the final figure, while governments who promise to cut their deficit by 0.2 percent of GDP, typically tend to increase their gap between revenue and spending by the same amount.\n\nNeedless to say, American politicians do the same thing with their forecasts. If you don\u2019t believe me, just look at the way the books were cooked to help impose Obamacare.\n\nBut set aside everything I just wrote because now I\u2019m going to tell you that we\u2019re making progress and that it\u2019s actually not that difficult to constructively address America\u2019s fiscal problems.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s look at how we\u2019ve made progress. I just wrote a piece for The Hill. It\u2019s entitled \u201cRepublicans are Winning the Fiscal Fight\u201d and it includes lots of data on what\u2019s been happening over the past five years, including the fact that there\u2019s been no growth in the federal budget.\n\nYou should read the entire thing for full context, but here are a few brief excerpts on why the left can\u2019t be feeling very happy right now.\n\n\u2026Democrats presumably can\u2019t be happy that the lion\u2019s share of the Bush tax cuts were made permanent. \u2026revenues are now projected to average only 18 percent of GDP over the next 10 years\u2026a smaller tax burden than we had throughout the Clinton years. And you can\u2019t finance big government in the long run without a lot more revenue. And they definitely can\u2019t be happy that domestic discretionary spending is now below where it was during the Bush years, when measured as a share of GDP. And with sequester-enforced budget caps, it\u2019s quite likely that number will drop even further. \u2026Perhaps even more important, looking forward, is that House Republicans for four consecutive years have approved budget resolutions that assume genuine reform of Medicare and Medicaid. And they\u2019ve won their biggest majority since before World War II, so GOPers can feel reasonably confident that voters (perhaps sobered up by the fiscal disarray in Europe) understand the need to modernize these programs.\n\nBy the way, the point about keeping taxes under control is critical. Simply stated, it\u2019s virtually impossible for government to get much bigger without a stream of new revenue (or, in the case of a value-added tax, a river of new revenue).\n\nLet\u2019s now focus on the second issue, which is how we can maintain this progress.\n\nHere\u2019s a chart I put together back in September that showed projected revenue over the next 10 years (blue line). I then showed what happens if spending is left on autopilot and also what happens if policy makers simply restrain spending so that it grows 2 percent annually (gold line), which is actually a bit higher than inflation.\n\nAs you can see, it\u2019s very simple to achieve a budget surplus. And we don\u2019t even need the same amount of spending restraint that we enjoyed over the past five years!\n\nThe challenge, of course, is that Obama and many other politicians (including quite a few Republicans) don\u2019t want government on a diet. After all, why let government \u201conly\u201d grow 2 percent each year when you can please the lobbyists, bureaucrats, cronyists, contractors, and other insiders by letting spending increase two or three times faster than inflation?\n\nFiscal probity isn\u2019t easy. Genuine spending restraint not only means saying no to special interests and campaign contributors, it also means picking smart fights. In some cases, Obama and the left may dig in their heels and threaten a partial government shutdown in hopes of getting bigger budgets.\n\nSometimes such fights are unwise, but there\u2019s a very strong case to be made that the GOP ultimately prevailed in the 1995 and 2013 shutdown battles.\n\nThe bottom line, as illustrated by this amusing A.F. Branco cartoon, is that Republicans shouldn\u2019t automatically act like the French army if there\u2019s a fight over something that really matters \u2013 such as a growing burden of government spending.\n\nAnd it also means not falling back into bad habits. Republicans were profligate big spenders during the Bush years and it\u2019s not easy to stay on the wagon of spending restraint.\n\nThis Lisa Benson cartoon is a good illustration of what will happen if GOPers cater too much to special interests.\n\nFor more information showing how it is simple to make progress, here\u2019s my video explaining how simple it is to balance the budget with modest spending restraint. It\u2019s several years old, so just keep in mind the chart above as you watch.\n\nThough I hasten to add that the real goal isn\u2019t balancing the budget. I\u2019m far more interested in restoring a limited, constitutionally restrained federal government.\n\nIf we do that, fiscal balance is an easy and obvious consequence. In other words, if you deal with the underlying disease of too much government, you automatically eliminate the symptom of red ink.\n\nP.S. Since I mentioned government shutdowns, I should point out some very good cartoons and jokes on that topic. They can be viewed here, here, here, here, andhere.\n\nP.P.S. On another topic, I\u2019m disturbed that Sony has cancelled a movie simply because the crazy dictator of North Korea apparently was able to get his henchmen to hack into the studio\u2019s computers. Sure, companies have to focus on the bottom line and make dispassionate decisions, but it\u2019s still troubling.\n\nPresident Obama could earn major praise if he undertook some big public gesture, such as showing The Interview at the White House, perhaps for some of the folks (such as Shin Dong Hyuk) who escaped that brutal regime.\n\nIn the meantime, here\u2019s a funny, yet also sad, image on what happened.\n\nRemember, this isn\u2019t just a dictatorship that has impoverished people with total statism. It is also a regime that starves its people to the point where its army had to lower physical standards because so many young people were stunted by malnutrition.\n\nThis post originally appeared here.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Balanced Budget,Big Government,conservative,cutting spending,Fiscal Crisis,libertarian,Politics,News,Blog,Current,Alternative,Freedom,Election,Nonpartisan,Ron Paul", "robots": "index,follow", "description": "Like a lot of libertarians and small-government conservatives, I\u2019m prone to pessimism.
