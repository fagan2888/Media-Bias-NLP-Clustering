And Wasserman Schultz didn\u2019t let the commander in chief down despite being grilled by CNN\u2019s Don Lemon regarding the recent scandal surrounding New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R).\n\nFollowing revelations that state employees had created lane closures across the George Washington Bridge to cause traffic in the town of Fort Lee, the DNC wasted no time in accusing Christie of engaging in political retribution. But CNN\u2019s Lemon decided to challenge party Chairwoman Wasserman Schultz on the difference between President Obama\u2019s stance as having no knowledge on the array of scandals plaguing his second term and Christie\u2019s similar rebuttal.\n\n\u201cSo congresswoman, here\u2019s what Republicans are saying today. They\u2019re saying President Obama faced a few controversies over the past year. Each time, the president has claimed that he didn\u2019t know. He didn\u2019t know about the NSA spying on aliens, he didn\u2019t know about the Obamacare website, he didn\u2019t know that you wouldn\u2019t be able to keep your doctor, so what\u2019s the different between Christie not knowing and the president not knowing?\u201d Lemon asked.\n\nWasserman Schultz quickly dismissed Lemon\u2019s comparison.\n\n\u201cThe difference is the issues that President Obama said he didn\u2019t now about were policy issues,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a scandal, a scandal that leads right to his office in which his staff and possibly him exacted political retribution in retaliation for a Democratic mayor in Fort Lee refusing to endorse him and his re-election.\u201d\n\nLemon continued to press the DNC chair, asking her why they couldn\u2019t all be considered scandals, from the lane closures in New Jersey to the NSA\u2019s surveillance programs. Wasserman Schultz, though, scoffed at the idea.\n\n\u201cOh come on,\u201d she replied. \u201cHow could you compare a governor and his staff potentially, deliberately shutting down three lanes of highway in retaliation, which these emails that came out today show that it was \u2026 How could you compare that to healthcare policy, intelligence policy and foreign policy. None of those three things were scandals. They\u2019re not comparable.\u201d\n\nThe Florida Democrat then went on to blame Christie for the scandal, saying she \u201ccreated a culture in his office\u201d that allowed such an abuse of power to happen.\n\nFollowing the news Wednesday that Christie\u2019s deputy chief of staff conspired with a New Jersey Port Authority aide to close down lanes onto the George Washington bridge, Christie vowed to take action. The New Jersey governor then fired both participants and addressed the issue in a news conference Thursday morning.\n\nWatch Wasserman Schultz defend Obama\u2019s scandals below.\n\nh/t Mediaite", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman-Schultz has been known to shill for President Barack Obama even in the toughest of times.
