Residents living around the recently closed Walmart near 13th and Oliver met to present ideas and hear options that could get them a new grocery store.

The Walmart Neighborhood Market at that intersection closed as part of nationwide reduction in stores. This left residents in that area with limited options for fresh food.

"We want a grocery store in there because a grocery store will bring in fresh produce and an opportunity for people to walk to the grocery store and carry their groceries home in their located community," said resident Robert Tillman.

Tillman is worried that liquor stores or payday loan facilities will set up shop in the area; he says that stores like those do not help the neighborhood grow and get better.

Wichita City Council Member Lavonta Williams said she is making calls and working to get a new grocery store put into the area.

At a meeting on Saturday, she gathered ideas from residents that they wrote on post-it notes and plans to take that information to determine what people in that community need the most.

"The information that they gave me is going to be so helpful. What is it that they have to leave their driveway, get in their car to drive to; what is it that they have to go and look for," Williams said.

She plans on having more meetings to discuss options for that intersection.

The QuikTrip located at 13th & Oliver shut down as well.
