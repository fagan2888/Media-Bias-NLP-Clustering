A firefighter jumped into the river and cut the car-seat straps, freeing the baby who was wearing only a flannel onesie and no hat or gloves.\n\nOfficers then formed a line in the river and handed the cold child from one person to the next until she was on the shoreline and in emergency workers' arms.\n\nTwo days later, Lily Groesbeck was recovering at a hospital, though authorities still don't know exactly how she survived hanging upside-down for nearly 14 hours in frigid temperatures with no food or water.\n\n\"It's heartbreaking. Was she crying most the night?\" Spanish Fork Police Officer Tyler Beddoes said. \"It's a miracle. ... She was needed for sure elsewhere.\"\n\nBeddoes, one of the officers involved in the rescue, recounted the ordeal Monday.\n\nPolice believe the crash occurred late Friday when the child's mother, 25-year-old Lynn Groesbeck, struck a concrete barrier on a bridge and careened into the river in Spanish Fork, about 50 miles south of Salt Lake City.\n\nGroesbeck had visited her parents in nearby Salem and was about halfway back to her home in Springville when she crashed, Spanish Fork police Lt. Matt Johnson said.\n\nInvestigators don't know the cause, he said. There were no skid marks, and the midsize car had no signs of mechanical failure.\n\nPolice don't suspect drugs or alcohol but were awaiting toxicology results. Groesbeck might have been tired or distracted, Johnson said, adding that authorities weren't ruling anything out.\n\nEven though the bridge gets plenty of traffic, no one saw the wreck because the concrete barrier obstructed the view below, Johnson said.\n\nIf a fisherman hadn't chosen that river Saturday morning, it could have been several more hours before the car was found, he said.\n\nThe overturned car was perched on the bank and rocks. As the girl dangled inside, icy water rushed just below her head through the broken windows. Temperatures were near-freezing.\n\n\"She must have been just out of the water enough to be getting oxygen,\" Beddoes said.\n\nWhen the four officers got to the vehicle, they didn't know how long it had been there or who was inside.\n\nAfter freeing the girl, responders rushed her to an ambulance and performed CPR, Beddoes said.\n\nLily Groesbeck was in stable condition and improving Monday, according to hospital officials. Beddoes said the girl was opening her eyes and doing well.\n\nThe girl's mother was enrolled at Provo College with a goal of becoming a medical assistant, her sister Jill Sanderson told the Deseret News.\n\nBeddoes said the family thanked him and the other officers for helping save Lily.\n\n\"Knowing that she was trapped in there 14 hours, the cold water running through the car, just blows me away,\" Beddoes said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Baby found dangling in overturned car in river shocks police - AP News: SALT LAKE CITY (AP) \u2014 Police told by a fisherman .05/26/2016 19:16:47PM EST.", "author": "AP News", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "SALT LAKE CITY (AP) \u2014 Police told by a fisherman about an overturned car in", "title": "AP News - Baby found dangling in overturned car in river shocks police", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/us/2015/03/10/baby-improving-after-14-hours-in-overturned-car-in-icy-river-n1968264", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015\\68\\59ef71f5-3ae5-454b-9e83-158b11b8201d.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "SALT LAKE CITY (AP) \u2014 Police told by a fisherman about an overturned car in", "title": "AP News - Baby found dangling in overturned car in river shocks police", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/us/2015/03/10/baby-improving-after-14-hours-in-overturned-car-in-icy-river-n1968264", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/68/59ef71f5-3ae5-454b-9e83-158b11b8201d.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Baby found dangling in overturned car in river shocks police, AP News, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "SALT LAKE CITY (AP) \u2014 Police told by a fisherman about an overturned car in an icy Utah river were stunned to discover an 18-month-old girl dangling in a car seat inside, unconscious but alive.\nThey found the baby in the back and a woman dead in the front seat after she flipped over the car.\nIf a fisherman hadn't chosen that river Saturday morning, it could have been several more hours before the car was found, he said.\n\"Knowing that she was trapped in there 14 hours, the cold water running through the car, just blows me away,\" Beddoes said.\nA firefighter jumped into the river and cut the car-seat straps, freeing the baby who was wearing only a flannel onesie and no hat or gloves."}
