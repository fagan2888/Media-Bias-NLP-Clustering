Everyone\u2019s browbeating them to burn more calories, meanwhile cities and towns across the land are outlawing one of winter\u2019s most beloved outdoor activities. City officials will do anything for the children(!), but even most of them seem to acknowledge that sledding bans are more about protecting cities from lawsuits than protecting kids from injuries.\n\nIn fact, bans might actually make sledding more dangerous. They could prompt kids and teens to head to more perilous sledding spots to avoid getting busted. Some cities ban sledding in all but a couple of spots, which could lead to overcrowding and increase the chance of collisions.\n\n1 minute, 33 seconds.\n\nFollow Nanny of the Month on Twitter (@NannyoftheMonth) and submit your nominees for next month!\n\nNanny of the Month is written Ted Balaker (@tedbalaker) and produced by Balaker and Matt Edwards (@MattChrisEd).
