If you enter every experience knowing that the more emotionally aroused you get, the more likely you are to remember it, it should be possible to exert a bit of control over the chaos that is this time of the year. If you\u2019re having a wonderful time at a holiday party, yes, solid memories of it will form no matter what, but you may be able to ramp up the quality and lastingness of these memories by going out of your way to have fun interactions with your fellow partygoers, by letting loose on the dance floor, and so on. The same goes for a quiet evening with family members whom you haven\u2019t seen for a long time: At the risk of sounding sappy, don\u2019t hold back. If you love the people you\u2019re with, let it show, and feel it. Doing so could help leave a stronger imprint of your time with loved ones.\n\nThere\u2019s a flip side to this as well: If we can use emotional arousal to help us solidify our best holiday memories, we can also use use its opposite toprevent distressing memories from sticking. That is, try not to get too emotionally caught up in the bad stuff. The best bet, whether your annoyance is coming from an airline or a family squabble, is to adopt a Zen approach and not let the situation get the best of you.\n\nThis is easier said than done, of course. In the moment, it can feel good to embrace your frustration, or to scream at someone who is annoying you (even\u2014or maybe especially\u2014if they are a close relative). But 20 years from now, do you really want to remember the 12-hour flight from Philadelphia to Boston? Do you want your family\u2019s fracas permanently burned into your brain instead of the time you spent building a snowman with your niece? Probably not. So just take some deep breaths and hum your favorite song to yourself, or bury yourself in a book, or do anything else that will help prevent those emotion-enhancing stress hormones from flowing during the bad times.\n\nThe emotion-memory trick is probably the best weapon in your arsenal, but there are some others as well. For example, a growing body of research suggests that taking photos of events leads to poorer recall of them later on. As Linda Henkel, a psychologist at Fairfield University, explained on \"All Things Considered\" back in May, \u201cAs soon as you hit 'click' on that camera, it's as if you've outsourced your memory. Any time we ... count on these external memory devices, we're taking away from the kind of mental cognitive processing that might help us actually remember that stuff on our own.\u201d It\u2019s easy, especially when everyone around you has their phone out, to give in to the temptation to snap photo after photo when you\u2019re having fun. But this could be counterproductive in the long run, so your best advice to is to suppress your shutterbug tendencies. (As for whether pulling your phone out during a family fight could help prevent vivid memories from forming\u2014well, let us know how that goes.)\n\nFinally, there\u2019s a fairly straightforward step you can take in the weeks after the holidays. \u201cOne way to keep memories strong is reactivating them though reminiscence and sharing stories,\u201d said Henkel in an email. \u201cWe not only strengthen our memories that way, we strengthen the social bonds that help us feel a sense of belonging and help us find meaning in our lives.\u201d So if you want to remember the good times you had, actively reflect on them and talk about them with those who were there. Human memory doesn\u2019t work like a hard drive, where data is stored in a pristine, semi-permanent state, available for retrieval whenever it\u2019s needed\u2014rather, memories reinforce themselves when we think or talk about them. Again, the same logic applies in reverse: If you want the bad memories to simply fade away, try not to dwell on them.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to feel overwhelmed and batted-around during the holidays. But we do have at least a little bit of freedom to shape our year-end memories. It might take some conscious effort, but you\u2019ll thank yourself a decade from now when you\u2019re not plagued by vivid\u2014and unnecessary\u2014memories of bickering with your still-bossy older sister.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "description": "This is supposed to be \u201cthe most wonderful time of the year,\u201d a time of fun holiday parties, warm get-togethers with family, and all-around peace and love.
