His agent, Todd France, probably doesn\u2019t want to strike a deal worth $X million a year only to have Bryant get $XX million from the Cowboys.\n\nDemaryius Thomas is making $3.275 million this season, the final year of his contract. He can become a free agent at season\u2019s end, although he would be a primary candidate for the franchise tag, which would allow the Broncos to retain him on one-year salary.\n\nJulius Thomas would seemingly have greater incentive to reach a deal on an extension because he is making $645,000 in the final year of his contract.\n\nThe Broncos have exchanged contract proposals with Julius Thomas\u2019 agent Frank Bauer, but those talks appear to have stalled.\n\nGarland, Jackson out. It shows how much the Broncos thought of Ben Garland that they put the backup guard on their 53-man roster, even though he has an ankle injury that will sideline him the first two weeks of the season.\n\nAlso absent from practice Thursday was defensive lineman Malik Jackson, who was attending his father\u2019s funeral. He is expected back in time to play Sunday night against the Colts.\n\nRod and the kid. After practice, rookie receiver Cody Latimer stayed to get extra work with Broncos great Rod Smith, the team\u2019s all-time receptions leader.\n\n\u201cI know who he was. I\u2019m glad he spent some time with me,\u201d Latimer said. \u201cHe was telling me how as a big, fast receiver, I can put the pressure on the cornerback. Keep my pad level the same when I\u2019m cutting and keep my eyes up.\u201d\n\nDefensive tradition. Earlier this week, the Denver defense watched footage of the old Orange Crush defense from the 1970s.\n\n\u201cThis is an offensive-minded regime, but we\u2019re trying to be the No. 1 defense and we\u2019re bringing that Orange Crush back,\u201d defensive end DeMarcus Ware said.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "No new deals imminent for Broncos\u2019 Demaryius Thomas, Julius Thomas", "title": "No new deals imminent for Broncos\u2019 Demaryius Thomas, Julius Thomas", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/04/no-new-deals-imminent-for-broncos-demaryius-thomas-julius-thomas/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140120__Broncos-Demaryius-Thomasp1-1.jpg", "height": 456}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140120__Broncos-Demaryius-Thomasp1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-04T22:18:32+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T12:57:21+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Contract talks with receiver Demaryius Thomas and tight end Julius Thomas aren\u2019t dead.\nThe Broncos have exchanged contract proposals with Julius Thomas\u2019 agent Frank Bauer, but those talks appear to have stalled.\n\u201cCan\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Julius Thomas said.\n\u201cGot to play football.\u201dDez Bryant\u2019s ongoing contract talks with the Dallas Cowboys might have put a crimp in bargaining between the Broncos and Demaryius Thomas.\nJulius Thomas would seemingly have greater incentive to reach a deal on an extension because he is making $645,000 in the final year of his contract."}
