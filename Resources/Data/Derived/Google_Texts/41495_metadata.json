He is on Twitter and Facebook.\n\nRegardless of what fate has in store for President Obama\u2019s Supreme Court pick, Republicans have been handed a gift: a chance to reinvigorate the party\u2019s conservative base in an election year.\n\nWhile the G.O.P. has controlled one or both chambers of Congress for 18 of the past 22 years, it\u2019s failed to tip Washington\u2019s balance of power in its favor \u2013 as was the case when President Bill Clinton bent conservatives\u2019 way in the aftermath of his first midterm drubbing.\n\nPromises both grand (repealing Obamacare) and petty (defunding N.P.R.) have gone unmet. Despite two rejections of Obama\u2019s policies in two nonpresidential elections, it\u2019s Hill Republicans who seem the beta males in this relationship. The conservative base has noticed and it\u2019s dismayed \u2013 so much so that even Donald Trump seems a compelling option.\n\nRefusing to give Obama a third Supreme Court appointment doesn\u2019t redefine Washington's landscape. In less than a year, we\u2019ll have both a new president and Congress. But it does provide a reminder to a party\u2019s jaded grassroots that winning an election has its benefits: filling the federal bench, or in this case denying the loyal opposition the opportunity to do the same.\n\nIf indeed Senate Republicans have decided that any Obama pick is dead on arrival, then the smart move would be to hold no Judiciary Committee hearings.\n\nWhat happens in November? If Republicans are smart, they\u2019ll have successfully exported the debate from Washington \u2013 straight to those select few states that will decide both the presidency and control of the Senate come November.\n\n\u2022 In Colorado, where voting for gun-control measures led to the recall of two Democratic state senators, talk about how Scalia\u2019s successor could have an impact on future Second Amendment cases.\n\n\u2022 In Ohio and Pennsylvania and the Republican-led states that fought the president\u2019s Clean Power Plan all the way to the Supreme Court, ask if a reconfigured court would deliver the same 5-4 verdict against the Obama administration.\n\nYes, denying Obama his choice is scorched-earth politics. And doing so will spawn an outcry from the news media and the Democratic establishment. But there\u2019s more at stake than the principle of fighting fire with fire. With an election on the horizon and Republicans in dire need of a motivated base, it\u2019s worth the stretch.\n\n\n\nJoin Opinion on Facebook and follow updates on twitter.com/roomfordebate.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"thumbnail_75": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2016/02/16/opinion/rfdscotus/rfdscotus-thumbStandard.jpg", "twitter": {"image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2016/02/16/opinion/rfdscotus/rfdscotus-articleInline.jpg"}, "communityAssetTaxonomy": "opinion/roomfordebate/novembers-referendum-on-justice", "applicationName": "shell", "PT": "blogs", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2016/02/16/opinion/rfdscotus/rfdscotus-articleInline.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "thumbnail_75_width": 75, "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2016/02/16/opinion/rfdscotus/rfdscotus-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "G.O.P. candidates should talk about how Scalia's successor would have addressed the Obama's Clean Power Plan and future Second Amendment cases.
