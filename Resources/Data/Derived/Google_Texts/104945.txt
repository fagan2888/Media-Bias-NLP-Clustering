Authorities say an employee on a forklift at the RockTenn paper mill was filling up a propane tank when the line ruptured.

Lieutenant Bryon Hughes with the Springfield Fire Rescue tells NewsChannel 7 there was no explosion, but there were flames reaching 50 to 75 feet high.

Around 1:00 p.m. Saturday, firefighters from Springfield, Bay County, and Callaway all arrived on scene to help extinguish the fire.

Officials say they used a deluge gun to keep the 1,000 gallon propane tank below what they call a "rupture temperature" until all the gas burned.

"Well it wasn't very large as far as width goes. It was a fairly concentrated event. It was just very tall and very hot," said Lt. Hughes.

Officials contained the fire by 3:00 p.m. A nearby shed, the forklift, and the propane tank were total losses.

Springfield Fire Rescue officials tell NewsChannel 7 one paper mill employee is at a regional burn center and is being treated for his injuries. No word on how severe they are at this point.

RockTenn declined to comment on the situation.
