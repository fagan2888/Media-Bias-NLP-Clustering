Ted Cruz started out complimentary toward rival Donald Trump. But, as Cruz's numbers have gone up in the polls, things have changed. (Gillian Brockell/The Washington Post)\n\nDonald Trump may not know Russian President Vladimir Putin is implicated in a killing or that \u201cpaying for everyone\u2019s health care\u201d is essentially single-payer, universal health care. Nevertheless, he does know something about dealing with other people, and in that regard is the perfect combatant to take on Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), who knows virtually nothing about that.\n\nIn the words of Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), Cruz has an authenticity problem. It is one Trump is expert at exploiting. On the loans Cruz took from Goldman Sachs and Citibank but did not disclose during the 2012 Senate race, Trump zeroed in on the issue on \u201cFace the Nation\u201c:\n\nTRUMP: Well, I think that Ted Cruz has been severely affected by the Goldman Sachs loans, which he didn\u2019t disclose. And it was on his personal financial form, and the Citibank loans he didn\u2019t disclose. JOHN DICKERSON: Couldn\u2019t that have just been a mistake? TRUMP: No. It could have been, but it is \u2014 two loans, give me a break, OK? And he is supposed to be Robin Hood for everybody. He didn\u2019t disclose them because he didn\u2019t want to say that he is dealing with the bankers. Don\u2019t forget he said he sold his assets.\n\nTrump is on the money, pardon the pun, explaining how Cruz set up a false narrative of himself and then had to hide the loans and make up a tale of self-sacrifice later. Trump can read an amateur manipulator and poseur because he\u2019s a professional, highly skilled one. Cruz is a relatively poor fabricator compared with Trump.\n\nThere is another sort of authenticity problem Cruz has. Because his ideological poses are so staunch and inflexible he: 1) does not bother to learn if they match the facts and 2) cannot deal effectively when adverse information pops up.\n\nOn foreign policy, he is so busy smearing \u201cneocons\u201d that he invented a \u201ccarpet bombing\u201d strategy to destroy the Islamic State, even though no serious person in either party (and virtually all credible, neutral military and foreign policy experts) thinks this would be effective, and in any event, it would be a war crime. Likewise, in order to maintain his pose Cruz has to make up all sorts of facts (e.g. we, not his own people, decided to take out Hosni Mubarak; Moammar Gaddafi was an ally.)\n\nThat has been Cruz\u2019s problem on immigration. He went so overboard in embracing the anti-immigration (illegal OR legal) stance that talk radio and Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) peddle that he outran his own record. He used to speak favorably about legalization. He used to be in favor of a massive increase in H-1B visas. When ideology meets record, he reverts to a familiar tactic: He misrepresents the facts.\n\nWe saw it again in a remarkable exchange with Chris Wallace on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d:\n\nCRUZ (ON VIDEO): We have seen now in six years of Obamacare that it\u2019s been a disaster. It is the biggest job killer in this country, millions of Americans have lost their jobs and have been forced into part time work, have lost their health insurance, have lost their doctors, have seen their premiums skyrocket. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE: But, Senator, the fact checkers say you\u2019re wrong. Since that law went into effect, the unemployment rate fell from 9.9 percent to 5 percent, as 13 million new jobs were created and 16.3 million people who were previously uninsured now have coverage. Now, don\u2019t get me wrong, there are plenty of problems with Obamacare. But more people have jobs and health insurance than they did before Obamacare. CRUZ: Chris, the media fact checkers are not fair and impartial. They are liberal, editorial journalists. And they have made it their mission to defend Obamacare. (CROSSTALK) WALLACE: There\u2019s certainly no question that more people have jobs and more people have health insurance coverage. CRUZ: Yes, there is question. Number one, we have the lowest percentage of Americans working today of any year since 1977. That\u2019s fact. They focused on \u2014 WALLACE: But there are 13 million jobs created, sir. That\u2019s a fact. CRUZ: The fact is that from 2008 to today, we\u2019ve seen economic growth of 1.2 percent on average. (CROSSTALK) CRUZ: Chris, don\u2019t interrupt me. I\u2019ll give an answer \u2014 WALLACE: That\u2019s changing the subject. CRUZ: No. WALLACE: Thirteen million new jobs have been created.\n\nOnly then does Cruz acknowledge that the rate of job creation \u2014 there are jobs being created! \u2014 is \u201chistorically slow.\u201d It just took several instances in being called out for misrepresenting facts for him to concede the indisputable. The conversation continued:\n\nWALLACE: Let\u2019s talk sir about your alternative, what you say you would do after you repeal Obamacare, how you would replace it. And this is what you listed in the debate. Sell health insurance across state lines, expand health saving accounts, make insurance portable so you can take it with you if you switch jobs. Now, conservative think-tanks say those are good ideas. They also say they would have no effect in giving people who are now uninsured health coverage. CRUZ: Well, that\u2019s simply not the case. So, for example, the biggest barrier to access is cost. If you want more people covered, what you want is lower costs. When you ask people, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you have health insurance\u201d, they say, \u201cGosh, I can\u2019t afford it.\u201d Allowing people to purchase health insurance across state lines would create a true 50-state national marketplace. That would drive down the cost and expand the availability of low cost catastrophic coverage. WALLACE: But, sir, the Congressional Budget Office, nonpartisan, the National Center for Policy Analysis, certainly not a left wing group, have both said that that kind of selling insurance across state lines would have minimal effect in expanding access. CRUZ: Well, I can\u2019t speak to what the CBO can say. What I can tell you is if you want more people to have choices, you want more choices and lower costs. That\u2019s what gives more people health insurance.\n\nHe cannot speak to facts from impartial experts, for sure. He must once again deny reality because it does not sync up with his rhetoric (nothing good at all, anywhere came from Obamacare). He assumes his supporters are know-nothings who believe his inflexible, false rendition of events. And worse, he has no specific, concrete and workable ideas to address the problem. He has spent so much time learning to inflame voters he has nothing to offer but anger and only a passing acquaintance with reality.\n\nAs for getting along with people, Trump made clear that deal-making is essential to politics: \u201cWhen I see Ted Cruz standing in the Senate and nobody else is with him, he\u2019s standing all by himself, and you have got all of these other politicians, senators, and congressmen generally, and he is trying to \u2014 he is by himself.\u201d He continued, \u201cIt is wonderful. And I can understand how a radio show host could say, oh, isn\u2019t that wonderful? You\u2019re not going to get anything done. You have got to be able to get things done. Ted doesn\u2019t have an endorsement from one United States senator.\u201d\n\nThat puts Cruz in the position of insisting he can do deals with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). Does any Republican or Democrat in Congress actually think that is true? Cruz cannot make deals with his own side, let alone reach across the aisle. When confronted on this improbable claim, Cruz insisted he could do deals because he had always treated his colleagues with respect. What?! Ask Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), whom he treated like a fourth-grader in lecturing her on guns; Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), whom Cruz called a \u201cliar\u201d; or any Republican who was accused of wanting to keep Obamacare because he or she opposed Cruz\u2019s goofy shutdown.\n\nCruz, it is evident from his life story and career encounters, has sublimated everything \u2014 personal relationships, kindness and honesty \u2014 to pursue his raw ambition. While we all need goals, when the goals become the be-all end-all \u2014 more important than doing your current job well, learning the facts and developing others\u2019 trust and respect \u2014 that is a problem. Ironically, Cruz\u2019s ambition for power and adulation is not all that different from Trump\u2019s quest for fame and wealth. The difference is Trump is candid about it. In a way, that\u2019s refreshing.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Trump knows a phony, especially a vulnerable one, when he sees one", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Trump knows a phony, especially a vulnerable one, when he sees one", "title": "Trump has a couple of things right about the phony Cruz", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2016/02/01/trump-has-a-couple-of-things-right-about-the-phony-cruz/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/01/26/National-Politics/Images/505044686-3611.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@JRubinBlogger"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2016/02/01/trump-has-a-couple-of-things-right-about-the-phony-cruz/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "trump and cruz, cruz lie obamacare jobs, trump and cruz goldman sachs loans", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "trump and cruz, cruz lie obamacare jobs, trump and cruz goldman sachs loans"}, "article_summary": "Nevertheless, he does know something about dealing with other people, and in that regard is the perfect combatant to take on Sen.
