We\u2019re working with our players\u2019 association. We\u2019ve been talking for several weeks and we\u2019re going to take a fresh look at everything we do.\u201d\n\nThe NFL and Commissioner Roger Goodell have been criticized for punishments that were too slow or lenient for Ray Rice, Adrian Peterson and other players involved in recent domestic violence cases. Goodell said last week the NFL wants to implement new personal conduct policies by the Super Bowl.\n\nThe NBA\u2019s collective bargaining agreement calls for a minimum 10-game suspension for a first offense of a player convicted of a violent felony.\n\n\u201cWe have in place the appropriate mechanisms for discipline, although we\u2019ll take a fresh look at those as well,\u201d Silver said. \u201cBut most importantly, it\u2019s education, and it\u2019s not just the players, but it\u2019s the players\u2019 families. That\u2019s what we\u2019re learning, too.\n\n\u201cWe have to take these programs directly to the players\u2019 spouses, directly to their partners so that they\u2019re aware of places they can go to express concerns, whether they\u2019re anonymous hotlines, team executives, league executives. And we\u2019re consulting experts. There\u2019s a lot to be learned here. It\u2019s a societal problem; it\u2019s not one that\u2019s unique to sports.\u201d\n\nSilver spoke at the opening of a refurbished Staten Island playground and basketball court in an area damaged by Hurricane Sandy. He was joined by Mayor Bill de Blasio and Knicks and Nets officials in announcing community efforts throughout New York, which will host the 2015 All-Star weekend. Silver said the goal of the programs is to directly reach 500,000 children.\n\nNew union executive director Michele Roberts also took part in what was her first official day in her new position. However, Silver said discussions with her started before Monday.\n\n\u201cWe do have in place, unlike the NFL, a penalty scale, and to the extent it needs any tweaking, then we\u2019ll talk about tweaking it,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cWhat I hope we\u2019re going to do as well is figure out ways to prevent any occurrence like that on our side. It\u2019s one thing to know how to react in the event it happens; it\u2019s a lot smarter to try to make sure it doesn\u2019t happen in the first instance.\u201d\n\nSilver noted that the NBA has had its own difficulties with issues off the court, saying the aftermath of former Clippers owner Donald Sterling\u2019s racist remarks means \u201ceveryone understands the high standard that we are living under now in the NBA.\u201d The NFL\u2019s issues just accelerated the need to look for improvements.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been going on, but the whole world is focused right now on what\u2019s happening around the NFL,\u201d Silver said, \u201cso it\u2019d be foolish for us not to try to learn from everything that\u2019s happening with that league as well.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Silver said Monday the league has been discussing with the NBA Players Association ways to further educate players and provide programs to them and their families.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Silver said Monday the league has been discussing with the NBA Players Association ways to further educate players and provide programs to them and their families.", "title": "Adam Silver: NBA to take \u2018fresh look\u2019 at domestic violence policies", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/sep/22/adam-silver-nba-take-fresh-look-domestic-violence-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/09/22/ap431520282254.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/09/22/ap431520282254.jpg", "description": "Silver said Monday the league has been discussing with the NBA Players Association ways to further educate players and provide programs to them and their families.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Adam Silver: NBA to take \u2018fresh look\u2019 at domestic violence"}, "Author": "Brian Mahoney", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Social Issues, NFL, NBA, New York"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdd2e\"", "article_summary": "NEW YORK \u2014 NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said Monday his league will \u201ctake a fresh look\u201d at its domestic violence procedures in the wake of the NFL\u2019s rash of incidents.\n\u201cWe have in place the appropriate mechanisms for discipline, although we\u2019ll take a fresh look at those as well,\u201d Silver said.\nSilver said during a community service event in Staten Island that the league has been discussing with the NBA Players Association ways to further educate players and provide programs to them and their families.\n\u201cWe\u2019re studying everything that\u2019s been happening in the NFL.\nGoodell said last week the NFL wants to implement new personal conduct policies by the Super Bowl."}
