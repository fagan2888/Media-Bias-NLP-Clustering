Pope Francis celebrates Christmas, prays for world peace at midnight Mass

Pope Francis called for more humanity on Earth during his traditional "Urbi et Orbi" Christmas address, which he delivered from the central balcony at St. Peter's Basilica during midnight Mass at the Vatican. His address focused on those suffering around the world — particularly those in the Middle East, Africa, and Ukraine — and also drew attention to the plight of children. Francis also made a call to Christian Iraqi refugees who were forced by ISIS militants to flee their homes. "You're like Jesus on this night," he said. "I bless you and am close to you."
