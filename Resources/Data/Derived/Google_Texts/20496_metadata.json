Now, the 19-year-old Liverpool winger is the pick of the skilful newcomers giving England hope after its opening loss to Italy.\n\nSterling has transferred his talents seamlessly from the Premier League to the international arena. Deployed as the playmaker by Roy Hodgson, Sterling took on established opponents without fear, withstanding the heat and humidity in Manaus to zip across the pitch dribbling through the Italian defense.\n\n\u201cFor a young player like me to obviously play in such a big tournament, when (Hodgson) told me I was starting I was a bit nervous,\u201d Sterling said Tuesday. \u201cI thought to myself it was a great opportunity for me to go out there and show the footballing world what I can do.\u201d\n\nBut personal plaudits seemed inconsequential to the Londoner, who didn\u2019t want to dwell on the 2-1 defeat in which his vision was exemplified by opening up the Italian defense in the leadup to Daniel Sturridge\u2019s goal.\n\n\u201cI was in a bit of a mood after the match, I wasn\u2019t really replying to anyone,\u201d Sterling said, addressing reporters for the first time since his World Cup debut. \u201cObviously replied to my mum and my sister but then after a couple of days after it sank in I replied to everyone.\u201d\n\nLosing admirably won\u2019t do again on Thursday against Uruguay, which opened Group D with a more demoralizing collapse to Costa Rica.\n\n\u201cHopefully over the game (I) showed some glimpses and helped my team,\u201d Sterling recalled of the Italy defeat. \u201cIt was unlucky that we didn\u2019t get the win, but I thought we played some good stuff at times and definitely on Thursday we will be going at it again.\u201d\n\nThe Jamaica-born Sterling, who grew up in London near Wembley Stadium, is cautious about expressing a preference to starting in the middle or in his more familiar club position on the wing, instead highlighting his versatility.\n\n\u201cAnywhere in the attacking position is my favorite position, and trying to help the team with a goal or an assist,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a young player you have to really learn and try to educate yourself in different positions every day in training and it\u2019s something I\u2019m willing to do.\u201d\n\nHe received advice before the game from Wayne Rooney, who burst onto the international scene a decade ago as England\u2019s teenage star at the 2004 European Championship.\n\n\u201cExpress yourself and enjoy the game and not think too much about what\u2019s going on,\u201d Sterling recalled Rooney telling him.\n\nWhile Rooney comes under public scrutiny over his failure to score across three World Cups, the 28-year-old striker is still someone the young players in the England squad study for tips.\n\n\u201cSome of the stuff he does with the ball, you try to take little clips out of his play and try to really learn from that,\u201d Sterling said. \u201cHe is a world-class player. I\u2019ve watched him. He is someone I looked up to, so to have trained with him at this camp has been a real honor, really.\u201d\n\nThe striker Sterling will come up against in Thursday\u2019s game is more familiar to him than Rooney: Liverpool teammate Luis Suarez.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather not see him on the pitch, really,\u201d Sterling said. \u201cHe is a great player, but I don\u2019t think we really need to talk too much of his qualities because we all know what he can do.\n\n\u201cAll the lads have played against him know what he is about. We know he has scored some spectacular goals and we will do our best to keep him at bay.\u201d\n\nRob Harris can be followed at www.twitter.com/RobHarris", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Teenager Raheem Sterling gives England hope at World Cup", "title": "Teenager Raheem Sterling gives England hope at World Cup", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/06/17/teenager-raheem-sterling-gives-england-hope-at-world-cup/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140617_022720_raheem-sterling.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140617_022720_raheem-sterling.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-17T14:30:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T08:01:33+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca970\"", "article_summary": "RIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 Four years ago, Raheem Sterling was watching the World Cup eating pizza with his friends.\n\u201cI\u2019d rather not see him on the pitch, really,\u201d Sterling said.\n\u201cExpress yourself and enjoy the game and not think too much about what\u2019s going on,\u201d Sterling recalled Rooney telling him.\n\u201cFor a young player like me to obviously play in such a big tournament, when (Hodgson) told me I was starting I was a bit nervous,\u201d Sterling said Tuesday.\nNow, the 19-year-old Liverpool winger is the pick of the skilful newcomers giving England hope after its opening loss to Italy."}
