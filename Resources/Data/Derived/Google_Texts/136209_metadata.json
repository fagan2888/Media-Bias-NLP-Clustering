Circuit Court\u2019s recent decision in Halbig v. Sebelius, which could render millions of Americans ineligible for health insurance subsidies on the basis of some sloppy syntax in the Affordable Care Act. After surviving more than 50 repeal votes in the House, a Supreme Court challenge to its constitutionality, and a famously rocky online rollout, health-care reform may end up hobbled by a mere drafting error. And the anti-regulatory crowd wasted no time in launching its next AutoCorrect attack: A new suit asks the D.C. Circuit to nix the president\u2019s biggest climate-change initiative\u2014EPA\u2019s \u201cClean Power Plan\u201d\u2014due to a 25-year-old mistake in the text of the Clean Air Act.\n\nBut don\u2019t panic just yet. As others have pointed out, Halbig is far from a done deal. A different federal appeals court, the Fourth Circuit, upheld the insurance subsidies on the same day the Halbig court invalidated them. If the full D.C. Circuit doesn\u2019t end up reversing its three-judge panel\u2019s initial decision (through a sort of mini-appeal known as en banc review), the Supreme Court will almost certainly step in to resolve the circuit split. In the meantime, no one loses her insurance.\n\nThe prospects for EPA\u2019s climate rule aren\u2019t so bleak either. First of all, the 12 state attorneys general who filed suit were a bit too quick on the spell-check trigger. Federal courts generally limit review of agency decisions to \u201cfinal actions,\u201d and the Clean Power Plan is still in draft form. As a result, the current case will probably be dismissed as premature. That won\u2019t stop the state AGs from re-filing as soon as EPA does publish a final rule, but even then, their victory will hardly be assured. Here\u2019s why.\n\nThe \u201cClean Power Plan\u201d is the administration\u2019s catchy(ish) nickname for a set of restrictions on carbon dioxide emissions from power plants, which generate a full third of the nation\u2019s greenhouse gas pollution. EPA\u2019s authority to regulate these emissions derives from a little-used Clean Air Act provision called Section 111(d). The section has been around since 1970, but when a bipartisan majority of Congress overhauled the Clean Air Act back in 1990, it amended 111(d). Twice. The details are complicated (you can read more about them here), but the upshot is simple: Under the language of an amendment that originated in the Senate, regulating power plants\u2019 carbon emissions is perfectly kosher; under the House\u2019s amendment, not so much.\n\nCompeting House and Senate amendments\u2014doesn\u2019t Congress have an app for that? Yep, even back in the digital dark ages of 1990, there was software designed to identify overlapping or incompatible changes to statutory text. But the conference committee charged with reconciling the House and Senate bills didn\u2019t have time to run it. As a result, both 111(d) amendments ended up in the compromise bill that was passed by both chambers and signed by the first President Bush. Meaning that both versions are, in some sense, the law of the land.\n\nA self-contradicting statute\u2014doesn\u2019t the judiciary have an app for that? Sort of. Federal courts certainly have an established rule for dealing with vague or ambiguous laws. Under the Chevron doctrine, if a statute does not \u201cspeak clearly\u201d with respect to a particular issue, courts will defer to any reasonable interpretation offered by the executive agency charged with implementing the law. In this case, the EPA maintains that the Senate amendment is more consistent with the Clean Air Act\u2019s overall structure and purpose. If Chevron applies, that justification should pass muster.\n\nThe tough question is whether Chevron will apply. It\u2019s hard to see how a court could find that the competing amendments to Section 111(d) \u201cspeak clearly.\u201d But are the amendments \u201cambiguous\u201d in the Chevron sense, or are they something else altogether\u2014say, nonsensical?\n\nPlenty of legal experts have shared their views, but at the end of the day, the opinions that really matter will be those of nine black-robed individuals in Washington, D.C. Handily enough, five of the Big Nine previewed their positions in a recent, fractured decision about an immigration rule. In Scialabba v. Cuellar De Osorio, the Supreme Court was confronted not with two contradictory versions of a single statutory section, but with a single statutory section that contained two seemingly contradictory instructions. (Cut Congress some slack, you guys. Drafting laws is really hard.) Justice Kagan, writing for herself and Justices Ginsburg and Kennedy, called the statute \u201cJanus-faced,\u201d concluded that its \u201cinternal tension ma[de] possible alternative reasonable constructions,\u201d and deferred to the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 interpretive choice. Chief Justice Roberts, writing for himself and Justice Scalia, disagreed that the two clauses were truly in conflict but, even more importantly, rejected the idea that Chevron was \u201ca license for an agency to repair a statute that does not make sense.\u201d In Roberts\u2019 view, \u201cDirect conflict is not ambiguity, and the resolution of such a conflict is not statutory construction but legislative choice.\u201d\n\nThe other four justices didn\u2019t weigh in on this particular question in Scialabba, so it\u2019s not clear whether Kagan\u2019s or Roberts\u2019 camp will carry a majority if and when litigation over the Clean Power Plan reaches the high court. But it\u2019s also not clear that the vote count will matter, because either way EPA should retain authority to regulate carbon emissions from power plants.\n\nCome again? First, consider Justice Kagan\u2019s view. If her logic controls, the court will apply Chevron, defer to EPA\u2019s interpretation of Section 111(d), and affirm the agency\u2019s authority to regulate carbon emissions from power plants. A win for EPA and the president.\n\nAlternatively, assume that Chief Justice Roberts gets the majority. The two amendments to Section 111(d) are almost undoubtedly in \u201cdirect conflict,\u201d so, in Roberts\u2019 view, EPA\u2019s interpretation doesn\u2019t warrant deference. Now what? Roberts\u2019 Scialabba opinion doesn\u2019t say what the court should substitute for Chevron in the case of a provision that\u2019s truly at war with itself. But if the chief justice believes that giving effect to only one of the two amendments represents a \u201clegislative choice,\u201d the judicial branch has no more business picking a winner than EPA. (In fact, courts are even less suited than executive agencies to this sort of policy decision. Agencies are, at least, indirectly accountable to the people, because agency leaders serve at the pleasure of a democratically elected president.) If it\u2019s not possible to honor the House and Senate amendments simultaneously, the only remaining option is to throw out both as invalid, in which case Section 111(d) would revert to its pre-1990 form.\n\nThat\u2019s the reason backers of the climate rule shouldn\u2019t panic: Under the earlier version of Section 111(d), EPA would still have authority to regulate carbon emissions from power plants. The agency still wins.\n\nOh, and if the current Congress doesn\u2019t like that result? Well, it remains free to share its preferred method for addressing climate change at any time. There\u2019s an app for that, too. It\u2019s called new legislation.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/dsc_00051.jpg?w=50", "sailthru.author": "Jack Lienke", "pocket-site-verification": "600c3e036c3d0b8412be38a78681c7", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "Grist", "description": "A federal appeals court recently took a red pen to the Affordable Care Act.
