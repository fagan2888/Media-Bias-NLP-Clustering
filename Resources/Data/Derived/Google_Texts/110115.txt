Kaley Cuoco had a good Valentine’s Day with her new husband,. She posted Instagram photos detailing the day that prove that it was nothing but romantic for the “Big Bang Theory” star.

The day seemed to start out in an informal fashion.

“Happy valentines day to my partner in crime, the sweetest loveliest man on earth. I❤ U @ryansweething!”

Cuoco didn’t want to forget her puppy on the special day.

“Happy Valentines Day to the other man in my life! #norman”

Things got a little more romantic and serious later in the day.

“It’s a gooey , silly love kinda day @ryansweething”

“Thank you @ryansweething for the most perfect valentines ever”

The romance didn’t end for Cuoco and Sweeting at the end of Valentine’s Day. How could it when the couple took a mini-honeymoon to Disneyland?
