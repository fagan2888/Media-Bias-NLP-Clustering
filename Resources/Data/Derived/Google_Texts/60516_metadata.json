Because the implication from headlines is that we\u2019re seeing an alarming trend.\n\nHeadlines like \u201cFatal crashes involving marijuana doubled in Washington after legalization\u201d and \u201cData: More pot-impaired drivers in deadly crashes in Wash\u201d seem to send the message that stoned drivers are causing the fatal crashes, especially in the context that we now live in a state with legalized marijuana. In fact, NPR actually frames the data with the stoned-drivers fear in mind. So, let\u2019s fact check how the media is covering the story.\n\nIs the role of marijuana in fatal crashes as bad as the reports imply?\n\nThe Jason Rantz Show fact checking machine says absolutely not. It\u2019s not at all true. Context is key. All the articles are citing data from the Washington Traffic Safety Commission. The AP writes, in part:\n\nData released Wednesday show that the number of Washington drivers involved in deadly crashes who tested positive for active marijuana doubled from 2013 to 2014 \u2013 the first year of legal marijuana sales in the state.\n\nWow! Doubled! How about some meaningful context?.\n\nAccording to the Seattle Times, \u201cthe number of drivers involved in fatal crashes with THC in their body increased from 38 in 2013 to 75 this past year.\u201d And according to NPR, since marijuana legalization, the percentage of blood tests that contained THC increased by 33 percent!\n\nBut of those 75, the Times cites, only about half of them had active THC in them. And that increase of 33 percent? It\u2019s not exactly what you think. If you\u2019re an occasional user, THC could be found in your system four days after smoking once and that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re high.\n\nNext, you can blame those 37 incidents on legal weed, I suppose, but that would be rather ignorant of the fact that legal weed stores didn\u2019t open until July of 2014 (which the Times does a good job of pointing out) and that pretty much no one was buying because the prices were high and the supplies were low. As the Times points out:\n\nSeattle, allotted 21 stores by state officials, saw only one shop selling pot until late September. What\u2019s more, there were more marijuana-involved fatal crashes in the first half of 2014, before stores opened, than in the second half of the year.\n\nAnd there\u2019s even more context. Of the 2014 samples with active THC in their system, half of those had alcohol in their system, and half of those were legally drunk.\n\nWe\u2019re not saying A equals B, said commission spokeswoman Shelly Baldwin about the link between fatal crashes and marijuana use in the Seattle Times. We\u2019re saying this is a factor. We look for trends and this is a trend we\u2019re seeing.\n\nTo be fair, some media reports are basing their headlines and shaping their coverage of this in a misleading way, and it\u2019s not the fault of this commission. But to say this is a trend? That more people have THC in their system involved in fatal crashes? Sorry, but that seems more like scare mongering masquerading as science. There\u2019s no causal relationship that they\u2019ve shown (which they admit) and if there\u2019s no causal relationship, this isn\u2019t ready to be disseminated for the public to think this is meaningful.\n\nWhat\u2019s most surprising is what\u2019s not often discussed, out of fear that it will send the wrong message. Driving while stoned isn\u2019t necessarily as bad as you think. According to the Washington Post\n\nA new study from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration finds that drivers who use marijuana are at a significantly lower risk for a crash than drivers who use alcohol. And after adjusting for age, gender, race and alcohol use, drivers who tested positive for marijuana were no more likely to crash than who had not used any drugs or alcohol prior to driving.\n\nRemember, many of the users with THC in their system had alcohol in their system, many of which were legally drunk.\n\nOther studies have shown drivers who were high were hyperaware that they were high, so they ended up driving slower and more safely.\n\nNow, this doesn\u2019t mean you should go out and get high and drive (please, don\u2019t) but it should offer you a toke of some fact-driven data, not fear mongering.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Is pot causing more fatal crashes than in previous years?
