MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) — An Alabama congresswoman is urging national leaders of the Veterans Administration to oversee changes at the VA health care system in central Alabama.

In a letter to Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert McDonald, Rep. Martha Roby of Montgomery says the recent removal of two top officials at the Central Alabama Veterans Health Care System was not enough. She says the central Alabama system has a “culture of complacency and cronyism” and requires more oversight from Washington.

Roby said the central Alabama VA has had a string of problems, including at least 900 unread patient X-rays being lost until recently, a pulmonologist being caught for a second time manipulating patient records, and a VA worker keeping his job after taking a patient to a crack house to buy illegal drugs.
