The company\u2019s website wasn\u2019t accessible Friday afternoon.\n\nBetween May and August, the company sent email messages with statements such as, \u201cToday is the deadline to make your election or be in violation of federal law,\u201d and effective Aug. 5, \u201chealth coverage is required by law,\u201d the FTC said Friday.\n\nUnder the ACA, often called Obamacare, uninsured U.S. residents have until March 31 to sign up for health insurance or face a tax penalty.\n\nThe FTC has asked the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida for a permanent injunction against the defendants.\n\nLinks in the email messages allegedly sent by the company led to websites with advertisements for insurance. The websites\u2019 operators paid the defendants when consumers clicked links contained in the ads, but insurance companies whose ads appeared on the websites did not authorize the email messages, the FTC said in a press release.\n\nThe company violated the FTC Act prohibiting unfair business practices by falsely representing that consumers would violate federal law if they did not select health insurance by the dates that appeared in its email messages, the FTC said.\n\nThe defendants also violated the antispam CAN-SPAM Act by not providing consumers who received the spam email messages with a clear and conspicuous notice that they had the right to opt out of receiving future commercial email messages, and by sending commercial email messages that did not include the sender\u2019s physical postal address, the agency said.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://core5.staticworld.net/images/article/2013/11/pcworld-idgns-primaryimage-100154539-small.png", "description": "The company sent email messages trying to trick people into signing up for insurance before the deadline, the agency says", "og": {"site_name": "PCWorld", "description": "The company sent email messages trying to trick people into signing up for insurance before the deadline, the agency says", "title": "FTC takes action against alleged Obamacare spammer", "url": "http://www.pcworld.com/article/2091280/ftc-takes-action-against-alleged-obamacare-spammer.html", "image": "http://images.techhive.com/images/article/2013/11/pcworld-idgns-primaryimage-100154539-gallery.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The company sent email messages trying to trick people into signing up for insurance before the deadline, the agency says", "title": "FTC takes action against alleged Obamacare spammer | PCWorld", "url": "www.pcworld.com/article/2091280/ftc-takes-action-against-alleged-obamacare-spammer.html", "image": "http://images.techhive.com/images/article/2013/11/pcworld-idgns-primaryimage-100154539-orig.png", "site": "@pcworld", "card": "summary", "account_id": 6070762}, "parsely-tags": "type: news,source: idg news service,imported", "DC.date.issued": "2014-01-24", "parsely-image-url": "http://images.techhive.com/images/article/2013/11/pcworld-idgns-primaryimage-100154539-gallery.png", "parsely-title": "FTC takes action against alleged Obamacare spammer", "fb": {"app_id": 1542125639335283, "pages": 7352931005}, "sailthru.tags": "government,security,grant-gross,news,short", "parsely-author": "Grant Gross", "parsely-section": "Government", "date": "2014-01-24", "parsely-type": "NewsArticle", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-01-24T20:30:16Z", "sailthru.image.full": "http://core0.staticworld.net/images/article/2013/11/pcworld-idgns-primaryimage-100154539-gallery.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "parsely-link": "http://www.pcworld.com/article/2091280/ftc-takes-action-against-alleged-obamacare-spammer.html"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0177\"", "article_summary": "Under the ACA, often called Obamacare, uninsured U.S. residents have until March 31 to sign up for health insurance or face a tax penalty.\nLinks in the email messages allegedly sent by the company led to websites with advertisements for insurance.\nThe company violated the FTC Act prohibiting unfair business practices by falsely representing that consumers would violate federal law if they did not select health insurance by the dates that appeared in its email messages, the FTC said.\nThe FTC has asked the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida for a permanent injunction against the defendants.\nThe FTC alleges that Kobeni and its president, Yair Shalev, sent unsolicited email telling consumers they would be violating the health-care law if they did not immediately click a link to enroll in health insurance."}
