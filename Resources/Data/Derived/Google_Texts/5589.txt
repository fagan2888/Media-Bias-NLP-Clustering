Greeley firefighters snuffed out an apartment fire late Sunday morning, according to a news release from the Greeley Fire Department.

The fire occurred on the 800 block of 37th Avenue. The release said officials were notified of the fire at 11:20 a.m. When they arrived, they saw fire blazing in the second-floor unit. Three fire engines and two fire trucks responded.

All residents had evacuated the complex by the time firefighters arrived. Although no one was injured, residents were evaluated for smoke inhalation. None required additional medical treatment.

By the time the firefighters put out the flames, four apartment units had been damaged. The occupants of those units will be displaced until a building inspection can be completed. The cause of the fire is under investigation.
