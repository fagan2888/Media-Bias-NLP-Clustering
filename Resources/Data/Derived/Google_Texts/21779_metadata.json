We\u2019ve seen their attempts to limit early voting, their registration misinformation campaigns, and their targeting of minorities when purging voter rolls.\n\nSome of their biggest successes have sadly come at the hands of the Supreme Court of the United States, most notably the gutting of key provisions in the Voting Rights Act in Shelby County, the legalization of political bribery in Citizens United, and the final obliteration of campaign finance laws in McCutcheon.\n\nAnd now, as Carol Anne chillingly intoned in the 1982\u2019s Poltergeist, \u201cThey\u2019re baaack\u2026\u201d\n\nOhio Democratic Party Chair David Pepper recently penned a scathing indictment of the Republicans\u2019 latest political chicanery for Cleveland.com, which I will proceed now to quote at length:\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court is considering a case that could upend the legislative redistricting process all across the country, throwing maps into doubt and causing electoral chaos \u2014 all for political purposes\u2026 The case that was heard this week \u2014 Evenwel v. Abbott \u2014 threatens the democratic principle of \u201cone person, one vote,\u201d which has ensured equal representation for everyone in America, no matter where they live, for decades. The group behind the lawsuit is the same one that fought to strike down important provisions of the Voting Rights Act in 2013. The lead plaintiff is a Texas Republican Party official. Their goal is to change the rules of the redistricting game to suit their own partisan aims. The U.S. Constitution establishes that congressional districts must be apportioned by total population. The Founding Fathers clearly intended that everyone would be counted \u2014 even those unable to vote at the time, such as women, children, people without property, noncitizens and convicts. However, it might surprise you to learn that state legislative districts have not always been drawn according to population. Prior to civil rights litigation that went all the way to the Supreme Court, states could draw districts without considering the people who would be represented. Predictably, urban and suburban areas lost out to rural, less populated areas. This injustice was struck down in the 1960s, with Chief Justice Earl Warren noting, \u201cLegislators represent people, not trees or acres.\u201d Since then, federal and state districts have been apportioned the same way, by counting everyone in a lawmaker\u2019s district as determined by the U.S. Census. Here we are in 2015, and GOP activists are challenging this decades-old precedent. They\u2019ve proposed that, when drawing legislative district lines, states should leave out large segments of their populations simply because they are not voters, either because they\u2019re too young to cast a ballot, a permanent legal resident or otherwise ineligible to vote. Extremist Republicans want legislators to represent people \u2014 but just certain types of people. The people who would be left out? Young people and people of color, who tend to be younger than the population as a whole.\n\nI\u2019m sure we\u2019re all just shocked, SHOCKED, to find Republican legal eagles targeting people of color and the young. Unscrupulous, callous, careless, reckless, these guys have about as much of the public interest in their hearts as the firm of Milton, Chadwick & Waters.\n\nThis past November, Ohioans stood up and loudly declared with 71.5 percent support that we are through with the corrupt, partisan drawing of our state legislative districts. We declared it time for a fair process. The Rorschach ink blot nature of our state district maps will not do. We want real representation, and fair districts.\n\nOhio is a purple state, too long stained red by winner-takes-all apportionment. Voters recognized it, and voted to fix it. And now, rather than accept that decision by voters, Republican legal goons are back to make a farce of the will of the people and to ratfuck democracy on a national scale.\n\nAnd what will SCOTUS do? Their history with Shelby, Citizens, and McCuthcheon doesn\u2019t fill me with confidence. The Roberts Court has an unpredictable track record, allowing those three tragic mistakes to proceed but upholding key portions of the Affordable Care Act and marriage equality.\n\nBut before you allow those decisions to fill you with too much hope, remember it\u2019s the same court that, in Hobby Lobby, put the \u201creligious rights\u201d of a corporation ahead of the medical rights of real women.\n\nI have always been registered Democratic, but like Citizens and McCutcheon, this isn\u2019t a Democratic battle, it\u2019s a democratic battle, for the people\u2014all of the people\u2014to be represented fairly and equally. Anything less is unacceptable, as our never-ending fight for small \u201cd\u201d democracy is a fight for the very soul of our republic.\n\nD.C. DeWitt is a writer and man of sport and leisure.
