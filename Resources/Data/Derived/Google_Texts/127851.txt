With Republican voters in Indiana heading to the polls today to select a GOP nominee for president, the Planned Parenthood abortion business has sent out a fundraising email to its supporters. The email goes after businessman Donald Trump, saying that he says “disgusting” things and “wants abortion outlawed.”

“You opened this email, so I’m going to make an assumption. You care a lot about this election and are pretty clued in,” Heather Holdridge, Director of Digital Advocacy for Planned Parenthood, begins in the email.

The abortion company director then goes on to malign each of the three pro-life Republican presidential candidates on abortion:

You know Donald Trump has probably said more disgusting things about women than any candidate, well, ever. You know Ted Cruz threatened to shut down the government over defunding Planned Parenthood. You may even know John Kasich has enacted measures to restrict access to reproductive health care.

SIGN THE PLEDGE: I Pledge to Vote for a Pro-Life Candidate for President

What’s one of the “digesting” things the email alleges Trump said? The email then singles out Trump for criticism and points out how he previously said women should be punished for having an abortion if and when the day comes that abortion is illegal and unborn children are protected.

Donald Trump says abortion should be outlawed, and when it is, “There should be some form of ________________” for women who have illegal abortions. Fill in the blank! The next president could pick multiple Supreme Court justices …ban abortion …block access to care at Planned Parenthood health centers …allow employers to deny birth control coverage …roll back Obamacare. The list goes on and on. We need to make sure that every voter knows just how terrible ANY of these candidates would be for women’s health and rights.

The fundraising email begs for “even more resources to stop Trump, Cruz, and Kasich.”
