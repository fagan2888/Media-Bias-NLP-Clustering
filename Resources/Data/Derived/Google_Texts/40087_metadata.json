After Indiana Gov. Mike Pence (R) signed a law permitting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, various companies expressed outrage and tried to position themselves as bold defenders of social justice.\n\nThere was just one little problem: Many of the same companies have been donating to the public officials who have long opposed the effort to outlaw such discrimination. That campaign cash has flowed to those politicians as they have very publicly led the fight against LGBT rights.\n\nPence provides a perfect example. During his congressional career, he led the GOP\u2019s fight against a federal proposal to extend civil rights protections to LGBT people, arguing that they are not \u201centitled to the protection of anti-discrimination laws similar to those extended to women and ethnic minorities.\u201d He also supported a ban on same-sex marriage, voted against the repeal of Don\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell, and argued that legislation to prevent companies from discriminating against gay and lesbian employees would \u201cwage war on the free exercise of religion in the workplace.\u201d\n\nIn light of that record, his move as governor to sign Indiana\u2019s so-called \u201creligious freedom\u201d bill permitting discrimination is not surprising. It is instead the culmination of his larger crusade waged over an entire career \u2014 one financed by many of the same companies now claiming they are outraged by the governor\u2019s actions.\n\nTake, for instance, Angie\u2019s List. The company\u2019s top executive, William Oesterle, was one of nine CEOs who signed an open letter to Pence demanding he revise the \u201creligious freedom\u201d legislation so that it does not allow discrimination. Oesterle also threatened to cancel plans for a $40 million expansion in Indianapolis if Indiana legislators did not change the law. \u201cIt\u2019s very disappointing to us that it passed and was signed by the governor,\u201d Oesterle said in an interview with The Washington Post.\n\nYet, Pence\u2019s record didn\u2019t stop Oesterle from giving $150,000 to his 2012 gubernatorial campaign.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The same companies decrying RFRA have sent millions in donations to politicians who support LGBT discrimination", "author": "David Sirota", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The same companies decrying RFRA have sent millions in donations to politicians who support LGBT discrimination", "title": "Corporate America\u2019s equal-rights farce: The truth behind its Indiana opposition", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/04/11/corporate_americas_equal_rights_farce_the_truth_behind_its_indiana_opposition_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/mike_pence.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The same companies decrying RFRA have sent millions in donations to politicians who support LGBT discrimination", "creator": "@@davidsirota", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/mike_pence.jpg", "title": "Corporate America\u2019s equal-rights farce: The truth behind its Indiana opposition", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Corporate America\u2019s equal-rights farce: The truth behind its Indiana opposition", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, EQUAL RIGHTS, Indiana, LGBT, Mike Pence", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdefe3\"", "article_summary": "Topics: EQUAL RIGHTS, Indiana, LGBT, Mike Pence, Business News, Politics NewsLast week, corporate America appeared to take a rare stand on principle.\nThat campaign cash has flowed to those politicians as they have very publicly led the fight against LGBT rights.\nOesterle also threatened to cancel plans for a $40 million expansion in Indianapolis if Indiana legislators did not change the law.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very disappointing to us that it passed and was signed by the governor,\u201d Oesterle said in an interview with The Washington Post.\nYet, Pence\u2019s record didn\u2019t stop Oesterle from giving $150,000 to his 2012 gubernatorial campaign."}
