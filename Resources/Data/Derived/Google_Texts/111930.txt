(Harrisburg) -- A dental clinic serving the less fortunate in Dauphin County is moving due to safety concerns.

Mission of Mercy offers dental services every other Thursday in Harrisburg's Allison Hill neighborhood, but its home base will change this week.

Instead of the Saint Francis of Assisi Church on Market Street, in the center of the neighborhood, it'll be in the Brethern in Christ Church on Derry Street.

Jennifer Charlton, executive director of the Maryland and Pennsylvania Mission of Mercy program, says a nearby gang shooting prompted the change.

"And frankly, it scared our volunteers. So we had to make the decision, there had been vandalism and break-ins and various things that were just not acceptable to us, for us to continue serving there."

Adds Charlton: "So we had to get into a location that would be safe for our patients and for our volunteers. So that was the justification, if you will, for the move."

Charlton says with the move, Mission of Mercy also hopes to renew its work with the faith community in Dauphin County.

She adds despite the Affordable Care Act, the clinic has been busy because plans aren't required to offer dental coverage for adults.

However, Governor Corbett's Healthy Pennsylvania plan does include dental services.
