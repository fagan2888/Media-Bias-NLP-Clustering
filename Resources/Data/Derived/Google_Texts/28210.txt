As the days tick down on Sen. David Vitter's time in office, the Republican lawmaker hasn't given up his protest over how Congress uses Obamacare.

Vitter plans to block Beth Cobert's appointment as the permanent director of the Office of Personnel Management over what he describes as an "illegal rule" for members of Congress and their staff.

He repeated his reasoning for his stance Wednesday (May 11) in a letter to his colleagues, saying he strongly disagreed with Cobert's apparent support for that rule.

"This is an outrageous act of fraud," he wrote. "It's all the sort of Washington insider self-dealing that Americans are so sick and tired of."

Cobert declined to comment Thursday through an OPM spokesman.

When Obamacare, officially known as the Affordable Care Act, was set in motion in 2009, an amendment before the final vote required Congress to enroll in the program, too.

In 2013, however, the OPM ruled that members could enroll in the DC small business exchange in a way that let them keep their federal health care coverage intact. Essentially, congressional staffers can keep their federal subsidies for health insurance - about $5,000 for an individual and about $11,000 for a family.

Vitter called that rule an end-run around the intent of the Obamacare amendment.

Vitter focused his ire not just on Cobert, but also other elected officials.

"Congress, under Republican House leadership and Democratic Senate leadership when the rule was issued, was also fully complicit in this fraud," he wrote.

The senator announced last fall he would not seek reelection in the Senate after he lost the Louisiana gubernatorial race to Democrat John Bel Edwards. Vitter's term ends in January 2017.
