Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, said the administration was slighting Latinos because \u201cthe Spanish-language Obamacare website hasn\u2019t even been launched.\u201d\n\nSlightly more than 30 percent of Latinos \u2013 who number 53 million in the United States \u2013 lack health care coverage. In surveys of Latino adults, a majority indicate support for the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe official said that the White House is addressing the various glitches that the entire system for signing up for the Affordable Care Act is experiencing, and that similar work is being done on the Spanish-language site, CuidadoDeSalud.gov.\n\n\u201cThe enrollment tools [for the Spanish site] will be unveiled in the next few weeks, enabling Americans to enroll in the Marketplace in Spanish online,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThis effort will help ensure that CuidadoDeSalud will be ready to intake large traffic, and provide an efficient and informative experience for consumers.\u201d\n\nRubio, who opposes the Affordable Care Act, said on Tuesday that he plans to introduce legislation next week delaying the penalty assessed to people who do not buy insurance by March.\n\n\u201cHispanics have among the highest uninsured rates in the nation,\u201d said the Florida Republican in a statement. \u201cYet despite hundreds of millions of dollars devoted to a Spanish-language propaganda campaign, the Spanish-language Obamacare website hasn\u2019t even been launched.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not fair to punish anyone for not buying Obamacare when the website they are supposed to buy it on doesn\u2019t work,\u201d he said.\n\nAdministration officials said that thus far, call centers have received 41,000 Spanish-language calls.\n\nMeanwhile, frustrated Democrats lamented Wednesday that persistent problems with new health care exchanges have inflicted damage on the public's perception of the already unpopular \"Obamacare\" \u2014 with some lawmakers insisting President Barack Obama should ensure those responsible lose their jobs.\n\nEmerging from a closed-door briefing with health officials from the Obama administration, House Democrats appeared to have at least as many questions as answers about how and when the beleaguered website will be fixed. Although they resolved not to let setbacks with one aspect of the health law outshine the parts that are working, they griped that the shoddy website had given Republicans an opening to do just that.\n\n\u201cThe ObamaCare rollout sends a clear message to Spanish speakers: If you speak Spanish, my administration didn't bother to create a functional website for you,\u201d said Republican National Committee spokesman Izzy Santa. \u201cThe fact that the Spanish site isn\u2019t ready for \u2018primetime\u2019 is just further proof this is an unworkable law and even Democrats are starting to agree that something needs to give.\u201d\n\nSome Latino organization representatives said they found the administration\u2019s seemingly dismissive reaction to Latinos not being able to register online troubling and insulting.\n\n\u201cHispanics are among the most social media-active communities in the United States,\u201d said Emily Benavides, communications director for the Hispanic Leadership Network, a self-described center-right group that seeks to bolster Latino support for the Republican Party.\u201dHaving a website that functions for them to apply and register for coverage in their chosen language, be it English or Spanish, is important, and it needs to function properly.\u201d\n\nBenavides, who said her organization has not taken a position on the Affordable Care Act, added: \u201cEven the administration considers the enrollment of Hispanics to be critical to the success of the program.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this story.\n\nElizabeth Llorente is the Politics Editor/Senior Reporter for Fox News Latino, and can be reached at Elizabeth.Llorente@Foxnewslatino.com.
