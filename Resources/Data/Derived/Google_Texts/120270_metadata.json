Terms of the deal were not disclosed.\n\nAccording to a news release announcing the merger, there are more than three million temporary employees in the United States, with about 10,000 small and mid-sized staffing businesses providing support for them.\n\n\u201cThe staffing outsourcing business is a growing industry that serves many small and mid-sized firms, which is a perfect fit for Paychex,\u201d the company\u2019s president and chief executive Martin Mucci said.\n\n\u201cWe believe the temporary staffing business is going to continue to grow, due in part to ever-increasing government regulation, including the Affordable Care Act and newly proposed overtime rules,\u201d he added.\n\nA number of staffing companies are already among Paychex\u2019s nearly 600,000 clients. \u201cThis acquisition will allow us to offer them more services and support,\u201d Mucci said.\n\nAdvance Partners CEO Joel Adelman said the merger will enable the company to \u201cleverage the capital, technology, and insurance resources of a leading provider of human capital management solutions to offer our clients a more complete suite of services to further accelerate their growth.\u201d\n\nPaychex stock fell slightly in trading Wednesday, closing at $53.91.
