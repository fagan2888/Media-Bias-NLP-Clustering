"This is the first time that people have had to worry about which one to choose," says John Treanor, M.D., a flu vaccine expert at the University of Rochester Medical Center. "In the past we just said, OK, you should get a flu vaccine. That's simple. Now you have all these different options without evidence that would really favor one over the other."

Indeed, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and most vaccine experts stress that for the great majority of people, the regular flu shot — a standard-dose "trivalent" vaccine protecting against three flu strains — is perfectly fine.

"Getting some type of vaccine is important," according to Richard K. Zimmerman, M.D, a flu vaccine specialist at the University of Pittsburgh. "Which one you get matters less."

Price can also be a consideration. Medicare Part B covers any flu vaccine appropriate for people 65 and older with no copay. Some private insurance plans also don't charge a copay for flu shots. For the uninsured paying cash at the pharmacy, the high-dose version retails for nearly twice the price ($50-$60) of the standard dose ($25-$35). The quadrivalent shot sells for several dollars more than the standard-dose trivalent shot.

HealthMap Vaccine Finder (flushot.healthmap.org) is a handy tool for finding a flu shot provider by town or ZIP code. The site lists the types of vaccines offered, but it's a good idea to call ahead to check on supplies.
