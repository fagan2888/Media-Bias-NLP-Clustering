Ted Cruz (R-TX) accused Democrats of declaring \u201cwar on the Catholic Church\u201d by imposing \u201cfaith fines\u201d on religious groups that refuse to offer contraceptives as part of employee health care benefits.\n\nThe Texas Republican spoke Wednesday in opposition to a bill introduced by Sens. Patty Murray (D-WA) and Mark Udall (D-CO) that would, in effect, overturn the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in the Hobby Lobby case.\n\n\u201cThe bill that is being voted on this floor, if it were adopted, would fine the Little Sisters of the Poor millions of dollars unless these Catholic nuns are willing to pay for abortion-producing drugs for others,\u201d Cruz said.\n\nCruz \u2014 a likely 2016 presidential candidate who has been claiming in recent speeches to faith groups that Democrats intend to overturn the First Amendment \u2013 then posed a loaded question to President Barack Obama.\n\n\u201cMr. President, when did the Democratic Party declare war on the Catholic Church?\u201d the senator said.\n\nCruz then offered some \u201cconcern troll\u201d advice to Democrats.\n\n\u201cLet me make a basic suggestion,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cIf you\u2019re litigating against nuns, you have probably done something wrong, and the Obama administration is doing so right now. Mr. President, drop your faith fines. Mr. Majority leader, drop your faith fines. To all of my Democratic colleagues, drop your faith fines. Get back to the shared values that stitch all of us together as Americans.\u201d\n\nSenate Republicans successfully filibustered the \u201cProtect Women\u2019s Health from Corporate Interference Act\u201d that would have preserved the contraception coverage exemption for religious institutions and nonprofit groups.\n\nBut for-profit corporations \u2013 such as Hobby Lobby \u2013 would have been required to provide employees with insurance plans that offered contraceptive coverage.\n\nAs for Little Sisters of the Poor, the Obama administration has said the charity\u2019s insurer \u2013 the Christian Brothers Employee Benefits Trust \u2013 is exempt from the mandate.\n\nBut the nonprofit organization objects to a federal requirement to sign a form that would allow employees to seek birth control directly from their insurance carrier.\n\nSupreme Court Justice Sonya Sotomayor granted a temporary injunction early this year from that provision in the Affordable Care Act, and the case is still pending before the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nWatch all of his remarks posted online by SenTedCruz:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Ted-Cruz-faith-fines-800x430.png", "height": 430}, "title": "Ted Cruz: Democrats \u2018declare war on Catholic Church\u2019 with contraception \u2018faith fines\u2019"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd185\"", "article_summary": "Mr. President, drop your faith fines.\nSen.
