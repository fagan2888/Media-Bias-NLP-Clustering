Throw out any unwrapped candy and inspect all packaging before letting your kids gorge on treats.\n\nIf the package looks suspicious, tampered with, torn, unwrapped or in unfamiliar packaging, throw out the candy. That should be the same message every year.\n\nEdible candies infused with marijuana must be packaged in a way that clearly identifies them as containing marijuana.\n\nYes, as the billboards and video point out, there are edible marijuana candies that look exactly like normal candies, and that\u2019s not good. And edibles make up a significant portion of retail marijuana sales.\n\nBut they\u2019re not cheap, either. A 10-piece package of pot-infused gummy bears, for example, retails for about $27 before taxes. So perhaps that will be a deterrent to anyone sick enough to want to give such candy to unsuspecting children.\n\nAnyone who hands out pot-laced candy could face felony criminal charges.\n\nParents, beware, but this Halloween shouldn\u2019t be scarier than any other.\n\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Yes, pot candy is legal, but usual cautions apply this Halloween", "title": "Yes, pot candy is legal, but usual cautions apply this Halloween", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/10/24/yes-pot-candy-is-legal-but-usual-cautions-apply-this-halloween/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141024__20141027_Z00_OP27E_HALLOWEENp1.jpg", "height": 557}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141024__20141027_Z00_OP27E_HALLOWEENp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-24T18:34:05+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T00:14:15+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Marijuana Colorado"}, "article_summary": "Yes, as the billboards and video point out, there are edible marijuana candies that look exactly like normal candies, and that\u2019s not good.\nThrow out any unwrapped candy and inspect all packaging before letting your kids gorge on treats.\nIf the package looks suspicious, tampered with, torn, unwrapped or in unfamiliar packaging, throw out the candy.\nBut this year should be no different for parents, who should always employ common sense on Halloween.\nBillboards and a police YouTube video are warning parents to be on the lookout for marijuana-infused candies in their children\u2019s trick-or-treat bags."}
