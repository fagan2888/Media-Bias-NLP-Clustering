Located off the northeastern coast of Australia, it houses more than 600 species of coral and thousands of other types of marine animals, too. Yet the reef\u2019s future looks bleak. In the 27 years from 1985 to 2012, half of its coral cover vanished. A significant proportion of the loss is attributable to climate change, which has strengthened destructive tropical cyclones and made surrounding waters warmer and more acidic. Conservation efforts alone, including protected zones and water-quality improvements, will not do the job. To further combat coral loss, marine biologists at a new research facility in Australia, called the National Sea Simulator, have devised a more radical approach: they are manually breeding supercorals capable of living in the increasingly inhospitable sea.\n\nOver the next five years geneticist Madeleine van Oppen and her team will breed global warming\u2013ready corals in a handful of the National Sea Simulator\u2019s 33 tanks. Van Oppen can precisely control each tank\u2019s salinity, temperature, water quality and pH, which allows her to select for individuals that can withstand stressful environments. A few tanks, for example, replicate the oceanic conditions that models predict for later this century. The specimens most tolerant to heat and low pH will be crossed to breed offspring with these traits and so on down the generations\u2014a process called assisted evolution. The process might happen naturally if corals could adapt quickly enough to their changing habitat, but with little time to spare, humans have stepped in to speed up the clock. \u201cThe predictions are very grim for coral reefs,\u201d van Oppen says. \u201cSo we feel we have to explore whether assisted evolution is a possible approach that could help us restore the reef.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Scientists are developing a radical approach to offset climate change's devastating effects on the marine sanctuary", "title": "The Great Barrier Reef\u2019s last great hope", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Scientists are developing a radical approach to offset climate change's devastating effects on the marine sanctuary", "title": "The Great Barrier Reef\u2019s last great hope", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/10/11/scientists_are_breeding_supercoral_to_combat_the_effects_of_climate_change_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/10/shutterstock_269208791.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Scientists are developing a radical approach to offset climate change's devastating effects on the marine sanctuary", "title": "The Great Barrier Reef\u2019s last great hope", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/10/shutterstock_269208791.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Annie Sneed", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, assisted evolution, Climate Change, Coral, great barrier reef, Scientific American", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd369a\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe predictions are very grim for coral reefs,\u201d van Oppen says.\nTopics: assisted evolution, Climate Change, Coral, great barrier reef, Scientific American, Innovation News, Sustainability News, Technology NewsThis article was originally published by Scientific AmericanAt 135,000 square miles, the Great Barrier Reef reigns as the world\u2019s largest living structure.\n\u201cSo we feel we have to explore whether assisted evolution is a possible approach that could help us restore the reef.\u201d\nThe specimens most tolerant to heat and low pH will be crossed to breed offspring with these traits and so on down the generations\u2014a process called assisted evolution.\nVan Oppen can precisely control each tank\u2019s salinity, temperature, water quality and pH, which allows her to select for individuals that can withstand stressful environments."}
