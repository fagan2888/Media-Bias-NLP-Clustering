Rauner understands that and he\u2019s working with his people to try and get a better understanding of precisely where the finances are on this current budget.\u201d\n\nMadigan said the Democratic leaders stressed the most pressing challenge is the $4 billion-a-year budget hole that will be created Jan. 1 when portions of a temporary income tax increase are set to expire. Rauner, who takes over for defeated Democratic Gov. Pat Quinn on Jan. 12, campaigned to fully phase out the tax increase over four years.\n\nCullerton said Rauner offered no specific budget plans, saying the meeting was \u201cmore of a get-to-know-you\u201d following a bruising campaign season. He added, \u201che was very nice.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t get into apologies, but we talked about moving forward and working together and that\u2019s what we want to do,\u201d Cullerton said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re waiting to hear what he would have to say about his budget, we told him that\u2019s the most important thing he can do,\u201d Cullerton added.\n\nRauner was more tight-lipped, saying only that it was a \u201cgood meeting and we look forward to many more working together.\u201d\n\nRauner, a wealthy suburban equity executive, blasted the two Chicago Democrats during the campaign as key players with Quinn in a corrupt Springfield culture that he plans to upend. But the reality is that overwhelmingly Democratic majorities in the House and Senate mean Rauner has to chart a careful course in order to accomplish his goals.\n\nAt the meeting, Rauner reiterated his call for lawmakers to avoid action on any major legislation when they return to Springfield next week for the lame duck veto session, even as Quinn has vowed to push ahead with his desire to raise the state\u2019s minimum wage to at least $10 an hour.\n\nMadigan and Cullerton said it was too early to say whether lawmakers will vote to increase the minimum wage before Rauner takes the helm in January, though Madigan said he is \u201cencouraging\u201d members of the House to support an increase. Rauner has said he favors an increase only if tied to pro-business measures such as changes in the state\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation system and limits on liability lawsuits.\n\nBusinessman Bruce Rauner prepares for his term in office after winning the 2014 election.\n\n\u201cHe repeated what\u2019s been reported, that he would prefer that significant items not occur until he becomes the governor, which is a reasonable request,\u201d Madigan said. \u201cWe explained there are some minor items that will probably be moving through the legislature between now and January, and we\u2019re going to tell him what they are as soon as we know what they are.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re currently working with Democratic members of the House, encouraging them to support the minimum wage,\u201d Madigan added. \u201cWe\u2019ll have a better understanding sometime next week where the vote count is on that issue.\u201d\n\nAt an event later in the day, Quinn scoffed at Rauner\u2019s suggestion that lawmakers should avoid action on major proposals until he and a new crop of legislators are sworn into office early next year.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not sworn in for part of your term, every day counts. Every day of your term, you have to be ready to do your job,\u201d said Quinn, in his first comments to the media since the Nov. 4 election. \u201cAnd I would say to all the legislators, this is not holiday time, this is working time. Your job is to work for the public good, and I would say on the minimum wage if you really want to help people back home, raise the wage and do your job because that\u2019s what the people want you to do.\u201d\n\nAt an appearance to highlight open enrollment for insurance coverage under the federal Affordable Care Act, Quinn pointed out the overwhelming support for a nonbinding ballot question asking whether the state\u2019s $8.25 an hour minimum wage should be hiked to $10 by Jan. 1.\n\n\u201cThe people of Illinois spoke last week, 2-1 margin,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cRaise the minimum wage. That\u2019s the best way to help many, many people escape poverty.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Madigan: 'Very productive' first meeting with Gov.-elect Rauner", "Description": "Democratic House Speaker Michael Madigan and Senate President John Cullerton held their first meeting with Republican Gov.-elect Bruce Rauner on Thursday, emerging to say they will put the negativity of the campaign behind them and work together on the state\u2019s dire budget problems.   \u201cI think we...", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune", "author": "Chicago Tribune", "og": {"site_name": "chicagotribune.com", "description": "Democratic House Speaker Michael Madigan and Senate President John Cullerton held their first meeting with Republican Gov.-elect Bruce Rauner on Thursday, emerging to say they will put the negativity of the campaign behind them and work together on the state\u2019s dire budget problems.", "title": "Madigan: 'Very productive' first meeting with Gov.-elect Rauner", "url": "http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/politics/chi-rauner-cullerton-madigan-meeting-20141113-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-546523f9/turbine/chi-rauner-cullerton-madigan-meeting-20141113", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp05.18", "twitter": {"site": "@chicagotribune", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=383137151, app-argument=http://www.chicagotribune.com/deeplinkid/81962617", "fb": {"page_id": 5953023255, "app_id": 306836229411287}, "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2014-11-13", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "googlebot": "index"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdacca\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI think we had a very productive meeting this morning,\u201d Madigan said after a two-hour get-together at the private Chicago Club in Chicago.\nCullerton said Rauner offered no specific budget plans, saying the meeting was \u201cmore of a get-to-know-you\u201d following a bruising campaign season.\n\u201cRaise the minimum wage.\nMadigan and Cullerton said it was too early to say whether lawmakers will vote to increase the minimum wage before Rauner takes the helm in January, though Madigan said he is \u201cencouraging\u201d members of the House to support an increase.\nDemocratic House Speaker Michael Madigan and Senate President John Cullerton held their first meeting with Republican Gov.-elect Bruce Rauner on Thursday, emerging to say they will put the negativity of the campaign behind them and work together on the state\u2019s dire budget problems."}
