And if the politicians in charge cannot find a solution to it, in that case how can we talk about a lasting mechanism?\"\n\nMerkel also says the EU must implement the quota system to redistribute 160,000 refugees to its member states.\n\n___\n\n4:05 p.m.\n\nGerman Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble is donating award money he received for balancing the budget to Syrian refugees.\n\nThe Stiftung Marktwirtschaft foundation said Thursday that Schaeuble would give his prize of 15,000 euros ($17,055) to the German Red Cross to aid Syrian refugees in the Middle East.\n\nWhile Chancellor Angela Merkel has faced massive criticism from members within her government coalition for welcoming more than 1 million refugees last year, Schaeuble has been one of her staunchest supporters. His donation of his award can be seen as a symbolic sign of support for her.\n\nStiftung Marktwirtschaft, which translates as Free Market Economy Foundation, said it awarded the prize to Schaeuble because he balanced Germany's budget despite the additional burden of taking in 1.1 million migrants last year.\n\n___\n\n3:55 p.m.\n\nThe Czech government has stopped a program to give asylum to 153 Iraqi Christians who were threatened by extremists.\n\nThursday's decision comes after 25 Iraqis who arrived two months ago asked to cancel asylum procedures.

Officials said they all applied for asylum in Germany, citing family ties.\n\nEight others decided to return to Iraq.\n\nSo far, 89 Iraqi Christians have arrived, and those who didn't leave may remain.\n\nInterior Minister Milan Chovanec has said the case shows a system of mandatory quotas to redistribute refugees in European Union member states cannot be functional.\n\n___\n\n3:30 p.m.\n\nGreek police say they have arrested a 36-year-old man after finding 17 migrants hidden beneath a false floor in his truck.\n\nPolice said Thursday the man was arrested the previous day after being stopped in northern Greece.

Hollande has called for \"strengthened international cooperation\" on the issue and France has decided to reinstate Panama on its list of tax heavens.\n\nThe French and German governments meet once or twice a year to discuss common issues.\n\n___\n\n2:15 p.m.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan says his country will not implement a deal reached with the European Union on the return of migrants from Greece if the EU does not fulfill its obligations toward Turkey.\n\nUnder the deal, Turkey agreed to take back migrants who reached Greece illegally from March. For every Syrian returned, Europe agreed to take a Syrian refugee from Turkey to be resettled in an EU country. Turkey is also set to receive funds to spend on the refugees, visa-free travel for Turkish citizens and sped-up EU membership talks.\n\nErdogan said Thursday: \"If the European Union does not take the steps it needs to take, if it does not fulfill its pledges, then Turkey won't implement this agreement.\"\n\nThe Turkish leader did not elaborate.\n\n___\n\n2:10 p.m.\n\nThe Vatican is confirming Pope Francis will meet with refugees on the Greek island of Lesbos on April 16, a highly symbolic show of solidarity as the European Union begins deporting migrants back to Turkey.\n\nThe Vatican said Thursday that Francis had accepted an invitation to visit by the spiritual leader of the world's Orthodox Christians, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, and the Greek president. Bartholomew will be in Lesbos as well.\n\nThe visit comes as refugees are being deported back to Turkey under a controversial EU program.\n\nFrancis, the son of Italian immigrants to Argentina, has been outspoken about Europe's moral obligation to welcome refugees. A visit to a refugee camp by the leaders of the Catholic and Orthodox churches could embarrass EU leaders already under fire from human rights groups.\n\n___\n\n12:15 p.m.\n\nAuthorities in Greece say thousands migrants and refugees camped out at the country's largest port near Athens have been given two weeks to move to army-built camps or be expelled by force.\n\nThe warning issued Thursday came as nearly a third of the 52,000 migrants stranded in Greece by European border closures are refusing to move to organized shelters and remain camped out at the port of Piraeus and at the northern border with Macedonia.\n\nAt Piraeus, government officials and translators spent hours trying to persuade migrants to move voluntarily to a new camp in northern Greece, showing them aerial photographs of the site and explaining what facilities are available.\n\nMore than 4,000 migrants remain at Piraeus \u2014 an important site for Greece's vital tourism industry.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Latest: Merkel: Protecting Greece's border a key EU goal - AP News: PIRAEUS, Greece (AP) \u2014 The Latest on the flow of .05/27/2016 9:15:25AM EST.", "author": "AP News", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "PIRAEUS, Greece (AP) \u2014 The Latest on the flow of refugees and other migrants into", "title": "AP News - The Latest: Merkel: Protecting Greece's border a key EU goal", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/world/2016/04/07/the-latest-pope-patriarch-to-meet-refugees-next-week-n2144832", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016\\98\\d7e14410-8383-4bbf-9b38-071190bf9f6a.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "PIRAEUS, Greece (AP) \u2014 The Latest on the flow of refugees and other migrants into", "title": "AP News - The Latest: Merkel: Protecting Greece's border a key EU goal", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/world/2016/04/07/the-latest-pope-patriarch-to-meet-refugees-next-week-n2144832", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/98/d7e14410-8383-4bbf-9b38-071190bf9f6a.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "The Latest: Merkel: Protecting Greece's border a key EU goal, AP News, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "___4:05 p.m.German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble is donating award money he received for balancing the budget to Syrian refugees.\nMerkel says protecting the maritime border between Greece and Turkey is a priority because when it \"is controlled by smugglers and traffickers.\nFor every Syrian returned, Europe agreed to take a Syrian refugee from Turkey to be resettled in an EU country.\nThe Stiftung Marktwirtschaft foundation said Thursday that Schaeuble would give his prize of 15,000 euros ($17,055) to the German Red Cross to aid Syrian refugees in the Middle East.\nMerkel also says the EU must implement the quota system to redistribute 160,000 refugees to its member states."}
