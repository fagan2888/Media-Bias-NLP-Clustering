They wanted to hear the same lines they had heard before.\n\n\n\nI was reminded of that story while listening Friday afternoon to Donald Trump. He appeared before a large and raucous crowd at the Delaware State Fairgrounds in Harrington.\n\n\n\nMany politicians suffer from the fact their speeches are so widely covered and instantly available, anywhere in the country.\n\n\n\nWhat played well in Peoria becomes tiresome in Pittsburgh.\n\n\n\nThat is not true of Trump. Like Martin, Trump is a phenomenon.\n\n\n\nAnd Trump\u2019s crowds, like Martin\u2019s, aren\u2019t coming to hear fresh material. They wait expectantly and cheer wildly for the catch phrases they know are coming. Trump announced, as he has countless times, that he\u2019s going to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd who\u2019s going to pay for that wall?\u201d he thundered.\n\n\n\n\u201cMexico!\u201d the crowd roared back, right on cue.\n\n\n\nMost of the people had been waiting for hours. I showed up at 3 p.m. for the 4 o\u2019clock show. It was just like going to the State Fair, creeping in a long line of cars on Route 13 to get into the fairgrounds.\n\n\n\nI didn\u2019t register as press. I wanted to stand with his supporters and gauge their enthusiasm.\n\n\n\nThat was easy enough. The sense of anticipation and party-like atmosphere reminded me of waiting, back in the \u201970s, for the Allman Brothers to appear at the Spectrum in Philadelphia.\n\n\n\nAmong the warm-up acts was state Sen. Colin Bonini of Dover, a Republican candidate for governor. He gave Trump his full-throated endorsement.\n\n\n\n\u201cI am not just proud to be here,\u201d he said. \u201cI am thrilled to be here and support and endorse the next president of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump!\u201d\n\n\n\nBonini, a longtime conservative, may not seem a natural supporter of Trump, whose conservative credentials are short-term and inconsistent.\n\n\n\nBut it makes sense. Any statewide Republican candidate faces a Democratic advantage in number of registered voters. Jumping on the Trump Train could allow Bonini to capture some of The Donald\u2019s momentum.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s been a lot of talk about Trump, if he were to become the nominee, hurting down-ballot Republicans.\n\n\n\nBut I wouldn\u2019t make that assumption judging from Friday\u2019s crowd. Not in Delaware anyway.\n\n\n\n(Today\u2019s primary vote will give us an idea of the depth of Trump\u2019s support here. My money\u2019s on Trump winning big.)\n\n\n\nThe crowd waited patiently, some buying hot dogs, others grabbing a smoke outside the arena.\n\n\n\nTrump arrived about 4:30. The crowd welcomed him with rock-star enthusiasm. I had expected a fair number of people showing up out of curiosity, not necessarily supporters.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s not how it appeared. Half the people, it seemed, waved Trump signs. They greeted each Trump line with calls of \u201cYou got that right!\u201d and \u201cAmen!\u201d\n\n\n\nIn person, Trump does project great energy and confidence. I had expected a short version of his stump speech but he fairly roared for over an hour.\n\n\n\nHe made so many promises he should have traded in his trademark red baseball cap for a Santa suit.\n\n\n\nYou want lower taxes? He\u2019s got \u2018em. For everybody! Because, he said, the United States is the \u201chighest taxed country in the world.\u201d\n\n\n\nThis is baloney, but Trump didn\u2019t get this far by being overly concerned about facts.\n\n\n\nAnd who cares about facts when you\u2019re having a good time?\n\n\n\nHe also promised to save Social Security and Medicare without cutting them; get rid of Common Core; end Obamacare and give America better health care; and make our military so powerful nobody would mess with us.\n\n\n\nHe did not explain how he would accomplish all these goals. Because, why bother?\n\n\n\nHe did make a big point of saying his supporters are not generally angry people. They have become angry, according to Trump, because of what\u2019s happening in Washington and to our country.\n\n\n\nThere was a lot of evidence of that anger at Friday\u2019s event. Every mention of Obama and \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d drew groans and boos from the crowd.\n\n\n\nOutside the arena, vendors hawked a variety of negative campaign trinkets.\n\n\n\nOne button touted the KFC Hillary Special: \u201c2 fat thighs, 2 small breasts \u2013 left wing.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnother read, \u201cHillary for Prison \u2013 2016.\u201d\n\n\n\nA T-shirt compared Monica Lewinsky and Hillary Clinton in a way inappropriate for a newspaper to print. On the back it said, \u201cTrump that bitch.\u201d\n\n\n\nStay classy.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m not blaming these sale items on the Trump campaign but it\u2019s hard to argue they don\u2019t speak to the mindset of his supporters.\n\n\n\nIf I had to distill Trump\u2019s appeal with one line from his Friday speech it would be this: \u201cPeople are tired of being pushed around and people are tired of being led by stupid people.\u201d\n\n\n\nTrump can protest, as he does too much, that his supporters aren\u2019t angry people, but they are brimming over with resentment.\n\n\n\nToward whom? Just listen to his speech. The same one he gives over and over again.\n\n\n\nNo, not all his supporters are \u201cracists.\u201d\n\n\n\nA recent letter writer said I accused \u201call\u201d supporters of candidate x \u2013 he didn\u2019t name Trump \u2013 of being racists.\n\n\n\nI said no such thing.\n\n\n\nI did characterize Trump\u2019s speeches as \u201chate-laced,\u201d which I consider self-evident.\n\n\n\nFrom his earliest campaign speeches, he has stoked fears of Mexicans, Muslims, Chinese, and others. Our problems, according to Trump, are because of these foreigners and our own \u201cstupid\u201d and \u201cweak\u201d leaders.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m not even accusing Trump of being a racist. I don\u2019t, for example, believe that he thinks Obama was born in Kenya. But he was willing to play that card as long as it helped him.\n\n\n\nDon Flood is a former newspaper editor living near Lewes.
