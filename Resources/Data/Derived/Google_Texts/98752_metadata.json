Chris Christie, former Gov. Mike Huckabee and Senators Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz \u2014 for expressing their strong support for Israel. Based not just on what you said but also on how you said it (e.g. \u201cHow many f\u2013ing Jews do these people think there are in the United States?\u201d) quite a few of those readers have now concluded that you\u2019re anti-Semitic.\n\nLet me sum up, in one paragraph, what I think I know about anti-Semitism: It\u2019s as old as the Judean Hills. It morphs but never dies. It\u2019s a derangement syndrome. It can afflict those on either side of the political spectrum. Those afflicted cannot be reasoned out of it because they weren\u2019t reasoned into it.\n\nLook, I\u2019m not jumping to the conclusion that any of this applies to you. I get that you\u2019re as much an entertainer as a pundit and that being provocative is part of your shtick. That said, would you ever tweet about \u201cf\u2013ing blacks\u201d or \u201cf\u2013ing Hispanics\u201d?\n\nOK, let\u2019s put all that aside and focus on what you now say you intended: to charge that the candidates were declaring their unshakeable support for Israel only to pander to American Jews. Will you bear with me while I raise a few points that challenge your conclusion?\n\n\u201cNo better friend, no worse enemy\u201d \u2014 that ancient motto, I would argue, describes how the world should regard the United States. But President Obama has spent years attempting to conciliate America\u2019s enemies while demonstrating disdain for America\u2019s allies. Remember the bust of Churchill he removed from the White House? Remember the missile shield for Poland and the Czech Republic he canceled? The Kurds have been asking for weapons as good as those being used by their enemies (who also are our enemies) but Mr. Obama has refused.\n\nAnd, most recently and significantly, he concluded a deal that will facilitate the flow of billions of dollars and sophisticated arms to the Islamic Republic of Iran \u2014 a terrorist-sponsoring regime dedicated to a global revolution against American power, a regime responsible for killing and maiming thousands of Americans over the past 36 years, a regime that controls four Arab capitals and has vowed to annihilate Israel.\n\nMr. Obama claims his deal will block Iran\u2019s path to nuclear weapons. He seems to believe it will inspire a more moderate mood in Tehran. Polls show most Americans are unconvinced as is a majority in both houses of Congress.\n\nPerhaps you figure Iran\u2019s rulers want nukes only to use against Israel and, unfortunate as that would be, it\u2019s an Israeli problem, not an American problem. What, then, do you make of their efforts to build ICBMs? They don\u2019t need ICBMs to mass-murder Israelis. They need ICBMs to deliver nukes to targets on other continents. Like the one you and I live on.\n\nThose who call themselves \u201cjihadis\u201d \u2014 Shia and Sunni alike \u2014 are right about one thing: Israel is the Middle East\u2019s lone outpost of Judeo-Christian values. Israelis believe in democracy, freedom, pluralism, tolerance, human rights and minority rights. About 17 percent of Israel\u2019s citizens are Muslims. They enjoy rights not available to Muslims in any Muslim-majority lands.\n\nAnd at a time when ancient Christian communities are being slaughtered in \u2014 and eradicated from \u2014 many of those Muslim lands, Christians in the Jewish state are safe and free. Their numbers are growing. Their holy places are protected. This would not be the case were the jihadis to drive Israel\u2019s \u201cf\u2013ing Jews\u201d into the sea. You get that, don\u2019t you?\n\nWhen jihadis vow to defeat \u201cCrusaders and Zionists,\u201d it is Christians and Jews they are talking about. They refer to America as the \u201cGreat Satan\u201d and Israel as the \u201cLittle Satan.\u201d Their struggle is both ideological and kinetic and it is the most significant of this century. Israelis are on the front lines. Front-line troops deserve support, don\u2019t you think?\n\nYears ago, Secretary of State Alexander Haig put it slightly differently. He called Israel \u201cthe largest American aircraft carrier in the world that cannot be sunk, does not carry even one American soldier, and is located in a critical region for American national security.\u201d In partnership with Americans, Israelis are doing cutting-edge work in such critical areas as missile defense, cyber warfare, port and airport security and intelligence.\n\nIsraelis have never asked American soldiers to defend them \u2014 they would not want that. They would, however, like Americans to support their right to defend themselves. Most Americans do. I assume you do, too.\n\nI\u2019m running out of space so here\u2019s my last point for today: George Gilder, as I hope you\u2019ll agree, is one of contemporary America\u2019s most brilliant conservative minds. (And, as you probably know, he doesn\u2019t happen to be Jewish.) A few years back he wrote a book called \u201cThe Israel Test.\u201d His straightforward conclusion: Israel is \u201cthe most vulnerable source of Western power and intelligence.\u201d\n\nMore to the point, Israel is \u201cnot only the canary in the coal mine \u2014 it is also a crucial part of the mine.\u201d If Americans will not defend Israel, they will \u201cprove unable to defend anything else. The Israel test is finally our own test of survival as a free nation.\u201d\n\nI think most of the candidates on the stage last week understand how Mr. Gilder reached that conclusion. You clearly don\u2019t but you\u2019re smart enough to follow Mr. Gilder\u2019s reasoning. Unless this is not about reason. Unless this is about something else. In which case, no words or argumentation will convince you.\n\n\u2022 Clifford D.
