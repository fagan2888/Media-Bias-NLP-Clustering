Joe Sestak (D-Pa.) never really stopped running against Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) after his narrow 2010 loss.\n\nBut despite lingering unhappiness within his own party about his last run, he might actually be able to avoid a primary challenge, allowing Sestak to focus his energy on defeating the GOP incumbent in one of Democrats\u2019 top pickup opportunities in 2016.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSestak announced in 2013 that he was already seeking another shot against Toomey. The former congressman has remained active in Pennsylvania politics since his loss, helping Democrats locally and statewide.\n\nAnd his strong, early signals that he would run again might have helped scare off many other potential opponents.\n\n\u201cJoe\u2019s done a very good job since he lost to Toomey of working the state, seeing Democrats, raising money. He\u2019s a formidable opponent in a primary,\u201d former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell (D) told The Hill.\n\nSome Democrats are still angry at Sestak\u2019s decision to run \u2014 and eventually beat \u2014 then-Sen. Arlen Specter (D-Pa.) in 2010, believing it cost them the seat and furious he refused to be a team player, even after Democrats wooed Specter to switch parties.\n\nBut even Sestak\u2019s detractors acknowledge his dogged campaign style. It\u2019s unclear who \u2014 if anyone \u2014 will step forward to run against him.\n\nA hard-charging former Navy admiral, Sestak has worked hard to thaw relationships with Democratic power players in the state since 2010. He spent much of 2014 barnstorming the state for local candidates, trying to appear as more of a team player.\n\n\u201cSestak, to his credit, has done a good job improving things. He had a real go-it-alone attitude,\u201d said one Pennsylvania Democratic strategist. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason there aren\u2019t more people poking their heads out; he ran a hell of a campaign last time, and he\u2019s learned from his mistakes.\n\nMost of the big-name Democrats who could run have already ruled it out.\n\nFormer Rep. Allyson Schwartz (D-Pa.), state Treasurer Rob McCord (D) and Rep. Matt Cartwright (D-Pa.) have all said no, while former Pennsylvania Environmental Protection Agency head Katie McGinty just took a job as Pennsylvania Gov.-elect Tom Wolf\u2019s (D) chief of staff. Pennsylvania Attorney General Kathleen Kane (D), once viewed as a possible candidate, has had a horrid year politically.\n\nMontgomery County Commissioner Josh Shapiro might be anti-Sestak Democrats\u2019 best remaining hope for a challenger. Shapiro represents a large swing county in the state, is close to Wolf, and many view him as a bright, rising star. But Democrats in the state say he might be more likely to stay put for now.\n\nAllegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald (D) and David Hickton, the U.S. attorney for western Pennsylvania, were also mentioned as potential candidates but haven\u2019t made any moves toward a run. A self-funding candidate might step forward, but for now, it\u2019s unclear who if anyone will challenge Sestak.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a core of desire to see another candidate, that another candidate could jump into. But I don\u2019t see anyone who\u2019s ready to take on that major challenge,\u201d said Rendell, who had endorsed Specter against Sestak in 2010.\n\nWhether Sestak faces a serious primary challenge or can focus exclusively on Toomey could make a big difference in the battle for Senate control in 2016. Toomey already has almost $6 million stockpiled. He has worked hard to burnish his bipartisan credentials and shed his Tea Party reputation.

He came from behind in one month after being outspent to defeat Arlen Specter. In the general election, he ran well ahead of all the other Democrats in the state; he barely lost in a year when most other Pennsylvania Democrats were losing by big margins,\u201d said J.J. Balaban, who made Sestak\u2019s 2010 campaign ads.\n\n\u201cAnd he\u2019s already been working aggressively around the state, not just raising more than $1 million and holding hundreds of events for various Democrats across the state,\u201d Balaban added. \u201cHe\u2019s the hardest working candidate in Pennsylvania politics, and that counts for something.\u201d\n\nNational and state Democrats say it\u2019s unclear whether a primary would help or hurt their chances against Toomey, arguing it\u2019s far too early to handicap a race.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if he\u2019ll have the field to himself, and it\u2019s too early for us to evaluate the field, him or anyone else. It\u2019s still 2014,\u201d said Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee spokesman Justin Barasky.\n\nUltimately, Sestak could still face a primary \u2014 most likely from Shapiro. But so far, he\u2019s managed to keep the field clear.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not the most popular person in the Democratic Party. His personality rankles a lot of people; you hear a lot of stories. \u2026 There\u2019s a desire from some corners for a challenger to Sestak,\u201d said Nick Field, the managing editor of the nonpartisan website PoliticsPA.com. \u201cBut If Shapiro doesn\u2019t run, it would be hard to find someone.\u201d\n\nThis story was updated at 3:50 p.m.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "For former lawmaker, campaign for Senate never really stopped.", "description": "For former lawmaker, campaign for Senate never really stopped.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Ballot Box"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "For former lawmaker, campaign for Senate never really stopped.", "title": "Unshakeable Sestak", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/227354-unshakeable-sestak", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/sestakjoe_102410gn.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-02T04:47:50-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-02T04:47-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/227354-unshakeable-sestak", "dcterms.date": "2014-12-17T06:00-05:00", "dcterms.creator": "Cameron Joseph", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "author": "Cameron Joseph", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Hillary Clinton,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-17T06:00:03-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-02T04:47:50-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/227354-unshakeable-sestak", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "For former lawmaker, campaign for Senate never really stopped.", "card": "summary", "title": "Unshakeable Sestak"}, "dcterms.title": "Unshakeable Sestak"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0e30\"", "article_summary": "Former Rep.
