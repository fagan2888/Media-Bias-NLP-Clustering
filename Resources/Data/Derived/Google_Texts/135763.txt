KAKE News On Your Side:

Most all the dogs featured in the video are up for adoption from animal rescue group Dobe & Dog Rescue.

The dogs were slated to be put down but the group rescued them and trains them to be adopted into people homes.

The group is always looking for volunteers to foster the animals.
