The Department of Education and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), however, are hoping to rectify the summer \u201cnutrition gap\u201d by working together and providing nutritious meals to eligible students during the summer, the USDA announced Friday.\n\nSome 21 million kids receive free or low-priced lunches during the school year, and they could be eligible for the summer meals program, which was started to provide healthy meals for low-income students during the summer months. Anyone under the age of 18 living in low-income areas that are approved by the Summer Food Service Program (SFSP) are able to participate to receive nutritious foods when school isn\u2019t in session.\n\nHowever, only a small fraction of the 21 million students participate in SFSP, with 2.28 million taking part in 2012. The USDA aims to boost that number. \u201cAs we approach the summer season, USDA is vigorously preparing to fill the nutrition gap faced by millions of kids across the country,\u201d Aubrey Rowe, administrator at the Food and Nutrition Service of USDA, stated.\n\nAccording to Dr. Jonathan Brice, Deputy Assistant Secretary in the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education, \u201cthe Department of Education believes that summer meals are critical to the success of millions of children across the country.\u201d\n\nThe program is rolled out across the states by state education agencies, and is paid for by the USDA, making each meal free for eligible students. Often meals are delivered at a state health or social service department, or else hosted by various organizations or sponsors that are federally approved.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in some places where they\u2019ve operated the program out of a park,\u201d Kevin Concannon, undersecretary for Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services at the USDA, told Masslive.com. \u201cThere, a local YMCA was area sponsor and dropped the food off. This can work a number of ways and we just need good partners.\u201d\n\nFood deserts and childhood obesity are hand-in-hand issues that leave America reeling with a serious lack of nutrition problem. In 2012, the USDA made a significant step in improving the quality of school food by creating new rules that revised the school meal standards for the first time in 15 years; these new rules maintained that school lunches should provide the correct portion, more vegetables, fruits, and whole grains, as well as foods with lower sugar, salt, and fat content.\n\nBut food deserts remain a problem, especially in the summer months when kids are more likely to be reliant on food provided at home. Food desert is the term for a location that has limited access to fresh foods or supermarkets, especially throughout areas that are low-income, where people don\u2019t have access to cars or transportation. According to the Food Empowerment Project, \u201cPeople\u2019s choices about what to eat are severely limited by the options available to them and what they can afford \u2014 and many food deserts contain an overabundance of fast food chains selling cheap \u2018meat\u2019 and dairy-based foods that are high in fat, sugar and salt.\u201d In the summer, it may be even easier for kids to stop by at the neighborhood corner deli that only sells pre-packaged foods like candy and chips.\n\nBut Rowe\u2019s view on the matter is optimistic: \u201cWith program participation growing in schools nationwide, and now the official backing of the Department of Education, the future of increasing summer meals participants and decreasing food security in America looks more promising than ever,\u201d she said in the press release.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "usda, summer meals, food desert, nutrition", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "While the USDA has made progress in providing more nutritious meals during the school year, only a small fraction of kids are enrolled in the summer meal program.", "title": "USDA To Provide Free Meals To Kids In Summer, Aims To \u2018Fill Nutrition Gap\u2019", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/how-keep-kids-eating-healthy-summer-usda-partners-department-education-provide-free-meals-276090", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/04/11/healthy-meal.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "While the USDA has made progress in providing more nutritious meals during the school year, only a small fraction of kids are enrolled in the summer meal program.", "title": "USDA To Provide Free Meals To Kids In Summer, Aims To \u2018Fill Nutrition Gap\u2019", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/how-keep-kids-eating-healthy-summer-usda-partners-department-education-provide-free-meals-276090", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/04/11/healthy-meal.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/04/11/healthy-meal.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-04-11T13:32:24-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-04-11T13:32:23-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "While the USDA has made progress in providing more nutritious meals during the school year, only a small fraction of kids are enrolled in the summer meal program."}, "article_summary": "The Department of Education and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), however, are hoping to rectify the summer \u201cnutrition gap\u201d by working together and providing nutritious meals to eligible students during the summer, the USDA announced Friday.\nSome 21 million kids receive free or low-priced lunches during the school year, and they could be eligible for the summer meals program, which was started to provide healthy meals for low-income students during the summer months.\nThe USDA has made steps in providing more nutritious and cheaper school lunches to public school students; it now aims to solve the summer vacation nutrition problem as well.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in some places where they\u2019ve operated the program out of a park,\u201d Kevin Concannon, undersecretary for Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services at the USDA, told Masslive.com.\nOften meals are delivered at a state health or social service department, or else hosted by various organizations or sponsors that are federally approved."}
