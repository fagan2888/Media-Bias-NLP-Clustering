The Baltimore Sun reported that he instead plans on helping the city in which he played as it struggles amid ongoing civil unrest.\n\n\u201cI felt it was important for me to stay in Baltimore and try to help the city I love,\u201d Lewis said in a statement released via ESPN.\n\n\u201cI greatly appreciate ESPN\u2019s understanding and flexibility at this late date,\u201d he added. \u201cI did not feel right leaving the city at this time.\u201d\n\n\u201cFew athletes are as connected to a city as Ray is to Baltimore, having played his entire career there and based on all the work he has done in that community,\u201d ESPN senior coordinating producer Seth Markman told The Sun.\n\n\u201cWhile we will miss him at the draft, we completely support him in this decision,\u201d he added. \u201cWe hope his involvement will help resolve the situation there.\u201d\n\nLewis lives in Baltimore following 17 seasons as a professional football player in the city. On Tuesday, he urged protesters not to use violence while demonstrating against law enforcement there.\n\n\u201cRioting in our streets is wrong, dead wrong,\u201d he said in a clip posted on his Facebook page.\n\n\u201cWe have to redefine what this looks like,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe must stop this right now. Go home. Go home.\u201d\n\nViolence began in Baltimore on Saturday following the death earlier this month of Freddie Gray, a black man who died while interacting with law enforcement. Gray died following a severe spinal injury suffered while in police custody.\n\nBaltimore police on Tuesday announced that 235 people had been arrested in connection with violence there. At least 20 officers were injured, and the city is now enforcing a curfew from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. for the rest of the week.\n\nESPN reported Tuesday that former NFL player Louis Riddick would take Lewis\u2019s place during the draft.
