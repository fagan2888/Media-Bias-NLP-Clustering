Fresh cut grass, hot dogs, and a friendly game of softball sounds like a perfect weekend for most.

Throw a wedding into the mix and then you've got something special.

"We are both huge baseball fans, not the same team but that is okay,” said the groom Nick Simmons.

Nick loves the Texas Rangers, and Heather is a big fan of the boys in Boston.

Today they threw aside their lifelong obsessions and brought their love of the game to family and friends.

"We are just going to pick teams school yard style, say you are here and you are there and play,” said Nick about the baseball game played immediately after the ceremony.

Heather and Nick were wed on field number seven at McNiel junior high.

They say the idea came to them once they determined the big date.

Bride Heather Simmons said, "It was near opening day, back to baseball, spring. It was just perfect timing and what better else to do on a baseball field.”

An event as special as this required special help, help given by the minister/DJ Steven Cook.

Cook said, "It was pretty random, so it was right up my alley."

Cook said he was a nervous wreck during the proceedings, but was able to appreciate the scene he was able to be apart of.

“ This is definitely tops as one of the most interesting weddings I have been able to do so far."
