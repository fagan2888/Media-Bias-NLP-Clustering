Speaking to Chris Hayes on MSNBC on Monday night, Sarandon, a Bernie Sanders surrogate, said she was unsure if she could bring herself to vote for Hillary Clinton in a general election. Hayes was shocked, but Sarandon posited that a Trump presidency might be preferable to a Clinton one, because it would hasten the revolution. \u201cSome people feel that Donald Trump will bring the revolution immediately if he gets in, things will really explode,\u201d she said.\n\nMichelle Goldberg Michelle Goldberg is a columnist for Slate and the author, most recently, of The Goddess Pose.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how many people Sarandon speaks for. There are lots of posturing radicals on social media who pretend Clinton would be no better than Trump, but my guess is that they are a tiny fraction of Sanders supporters. Sanders himself certainly doesn\u2019t encourage such political nihilism and will surely rally to Clinton\u2019s side if she beats him in the primary. Inasmuch as #NeverHillary is a phenomenon, however, Sarandon, a rich white celebrity with nothing on the line, is a perfect spokeswoman for it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nWhat Sarandon is voicing is the old Leninist idea of \u201cheightening the contradictions,\u201d which holds that social conditions need to get worse in order to inspire the revolution that will make them better. In this way of thinking, the real enemy of progress is incremental reform that would render the status quo tolerable. That was the position of the German Communists in the early 1930s, who refused to ally with the Social Democrats, proclaiming: \u201cAfter Hitler, our turn!\u201d A similar\u2014if less deadly\u2014assumption underlay Ralph Nader\u2019s 2000 presidential campaign, for which Sarandon served as co-chair of the national steering committee. George W. Bush, Nader argued then, could serve as a \u201cprovocateur,\u201d awakening the power of the left. \u201cIf it were a choice between a provocateur and an \u2018anesthetizer,\u2019 I'd rather have a provocateur,\u201d said Nader. \u201cIt would mobilize us.\u201d\n\nTo be fair to Nader, under Bush, the contradictions got pretty high. He left the Middle East in flames, and the economy hasn\u2019t recovered from the financial implosion he presided over. Had Bush not wrecked so many lives, we might never have gotten President Obama and the Affordable Care Act, or, for that matter, a democratic socialist running a credible presidential primary campaign. Yet the Bush example should also make it obvious that the cost of electing a Republican provocateur is human misery on an inconceivable scale, inflicted on people who lack Sarandon\u2019s many resources.\n\nThe problems with Sarandon\u2019s position go beyond its tolerance for human sacrifice. There\u2019s also the gormless unreality of her idea of revolution. Does she mean a political revolution, like the one Sanders has proposed? Because the major barrier to such a revolution is not a populace that needs to suffer more in order to reach Sarandon\u2019s superlative level of wokeness. It is the structural obstacles to democracy systematically erected by Republicans and Republican-appointed judges: the widespread erosion of voting rights, the unlimited flood of money into politics unleashed by the Supreme Court, and the epic gerrymandering following the 2010 census that makes it nearly impossible for Democrats to win back the House, even if they win a majority of votes. These things will get worse, not better, in any Republican administration, making the possibility of a peaceful electoral revolution all the more remote.\n\nBut maybe that\u2019s not the sort of revolution Sarandon has in mind? Maybe she actually longs for the kind where things \u201creally explode\u201d? If so, one wonders who she thinks is going to fight this revolution. It\u2019s certainly possible that a Trump presidency could lead to violent political conflict. If it comes to that, however, my money is on the side with all the gun fetishists, not subscribers to Jacobin.", "article_metadata": {"fb-share": "Heightening the contradictions, indeed.", "sailthru.author": "Michelle Goldberg", "description": "Let\u2019s be grateful to Susan Sarandon for exposing just how vapid and callous the left-wing #NeverHillary argument is.
