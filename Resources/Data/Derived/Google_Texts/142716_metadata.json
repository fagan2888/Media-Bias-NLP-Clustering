For 2014, the definition of affordability was set at 9.5% of the employee\u2019s income. For 2015, the definition of affordability is set at 9.56%.\n\nWhile a relatively minor change, it is a reminder that the definition of affordability for the employer mandate may change.\n\nSummary of Employer Mandate for 2015\n\nAs a quick recap, 2015 is a \"phase-in\" year for the employer mandate. In 2015, the provision only applies to employers with 100+ FTE employees and there is additional flexibility for employers.\n\nFor 2015, if an employer with at least 100 full-time employees (including full-time equivalents) does not offer \"minimum essential\" and \"affordable\" coverage -- or offers coverage to fewer than 70% of its full-time employees (and their dependents) -- the employer will owe an Employer Shared Responsibility Fee IF one of their employees purchases a health plan through the exchanges and receives a federal tax credit or subsidy.\n\nUpdated Employer Mandate Affordability Test for 2015\n\nFor 2015, an employer\u2019s coverage is considered unaffordable for any full-time employees who, in a given month, enroll in a health plan offered through their state exchange and are eligible to receive federal assistance. An employee is only eligible for federal assistance through the exchange if their required contributions for their employer's plan is greater than 9.56% (again, this percentage was revised from 9.5% in 2014).\n\n\n\nThis change was outlined in Rev. Proc. 2014-37.\n\nWhile this is a relatively small change, it does serve as a reminder that the ACA guidelines are a moving target, and that definitions and guidelines will change. Each year, employers should review the rates with their health insurance broker to ensure compliance.\n\nSee also: Quick Guide to Calculating Employer Shared Responsibility Fees in 2015\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "The employer mandate affordability definition has been updated for 2015.
