Many families across the twin states are left counting blessings after a series of tornado warnings put severe weather plans in action. It started as a PDS Tornado Watch shortly before lunch on December 23rd, before tornado warnings started being issued. One of the hardest hit areas was Northeast, Mississippi which was the sight of one of the longest tornadoes to track through the state in the month of December.

"This is a miracle," Ashland Resident Dr. Patrick Washington told Action News out of Memphis. "There's no way that three individuals were in the house at this time and they were able to walk away."

The track is over 140 miles long and began in the Delta, before finally roping out in West Tennessee near Selmer. For over 2 hours, the tornado caused chaos and left several dead, with the youngest being that of a 7 year old boy. As the reports continue to come in, so far nearly 15 tornadoes have been confirmed in Mississippi.

"You'll never know how important it is to seek shelter immediately, however you can, because it's a life saver," Captain Bart Rosson of Perry County, TN Sheriff's Department told Fox 17 News.

While the severe weather carried on into Christmas Eve Day, the tornado threat became less likely and the focus began to shift to flooding. Areas all across the Twin States saw countless roads flooded and flash flood watches and warnings go into effect. Birmingham, Alabama, also saw a tornado hit just south of the metropolitan on Christmas night.

"The damage was done was confined to approximately one square mile," Birmingham Fire Chief Charles Gordon told WVTM. " We had three structures that collapsed. We transported one patient from the scene. There were two others that were taken from the scene, but we reported no injuries."

In all 16 deaths have been confirmed with storms that ravaged the Deep South and the countless others who were lying in the path of the tornadoes were left counting blessings.
