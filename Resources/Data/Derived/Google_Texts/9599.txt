Ben Casselman reads an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal and declares,

It is, without exaggeration, one of the dumbest things I’ve ever read. And I read Zero Hedge.

I’d say that he doesn’t get out enough — you can get much, much dumber. Still, the piece in question is a diatribe against seasonal adjustment, and is so amazingly ignorant that you might wonder how it got published in the Journal. You might wonder, that is, if you didn’t understand what’s happening: we’re witnessing the coming of the employment truthers.

When Obama and the Fed began their efforts to rescue the economy from the worst financial crisis since the 1930s, the right knew, just knew, what was going to happen. Inflation was going to soar thanks to money-printing and deficits; private employment would stagnate because of Obamacare, and also because Obama was hurting the feelings of job creators.

When inflation failed to take off, in came the inflation truthers, insisting that the official numbers were wrong and probably a deliberate fake.

Now, how’s that employment prediction doing? Witness the terrible effect of a socialist who trash-talks capitalism:

Hence the eagerness to publish any argument claiming that the numbers are somehow fake. Expect more dumbness.
