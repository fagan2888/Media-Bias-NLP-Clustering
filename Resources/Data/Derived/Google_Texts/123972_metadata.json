Likewise, it\u2019s difficult to get an exact count on the incidents where police use physical force \u2014 or have physical force used on them.\n\nSome of the most up-to-date information the agency has comes from a 2011 study, which found that out of roughly 98 million arrests made between 2003 and 2009, about 4,800 people died while being arrested by law enforcement agents.\n\nA little over 60 percent of those deaths \u2014 2,931 \u2014 were labeled as \u201chomicides by law enforcement personnel,\u201d though the report did not go into detail on how many killings were ruled to be justified in the line of duty and how many were ruled to be mistakes by police.\n\nThe report did say that roughly half of all arrest-related deaths involved a suspect assaulting officers. Of those who died, 42 percent were white, 32 percent were black and 20 percent were Hispanic.\n\nMr. Holder called upon the Justice Department and the nation to meet difficult challenges head on, in the spirit of King.\n\n\u201cLet us not shy away from, but embrace, the noisy discord of honest, frank and vigorous debate,\u201d the attorney general said. \u201cAnd let us reject the empty rhetoric of anyone who would engage in cynical attempts to divide and cast blame \u2014 choosing instead to affirm once more that Americans from all backgrounds and perspectives must come together to be part of positive change.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Attorney General Eric Holder said Thursday the nation needs more data about the number of police shootings and the use of force by law enforcement officers, calling the lack of information about the police \"unacceptable.\"", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Attorney General Eric Holder said Thursday the nation needs more data about the number of police shootings and the use of force by law enforcement officers, calling the lack of information about the police \u201cunacceptable.\u201d", "title": "Eric Holder slams \u2018unacceptable\u2019 lack of info on police shootings", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/15/eric-holder-slams-unacceptable-lack-info-police-sh/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/14/b57448f944e13b026b0f6a7067004a29.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/14/b57448f944e13b026b0f6a7067004a29.jpg", "description": "Attorney General Eric Holder said Thursday the nation needs more data about the number of police shootings and the use of force by law enforcement officers, calling the lack of information about the p", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Eric Holder slams \u2018unacceptable\u2019 lack of info on police sh"}, "Author": "Phillip Swarts", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Law Crime, Eric Holder, Martin Luther King Jr, Department Of Justice"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe29d5\"", "article_summary": "Mr. Holder called upon the Justice Department and the nation to meet difficult challenges head on, in the spirit of King.\nLikewise, it\u2019s difficult to get an exact count on the incidents where police use physical force \u2014 or have physical force used on them.\n\u201cLet us not shy away from, but embrace, the noisy discord of honest, frank and vigorous debate,\u201d the attorney general said.\nThere have been calls for clearer information on incidents of violence that involve police since the August death of black teenager Michael Brown during a confrontation with a white police officer.\nThe report did say that roughly half of all arrest-related deaths involved a suspect assaulting officers."}
