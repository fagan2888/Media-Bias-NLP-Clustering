The much-anticipated announcement of the Realtor, Broker/Owner and Affiliate-of-the-Year was also made.

Those honors went to VCCAR Past-President Karen Heyrend, with Berkshire Hathaway Home Services, Ventura, who was named the Realtor-of-the-Year for 2014. VCCAR Director Richard Snowden, owner of Big Rich Realty was named Broker-of-the-Year and Michele Mueller, sales executive for Lawyers Title, Oxnard, was named Affiliate-of-the-Year.

Prior to handing over the president’s gavel to Ward, Goldstein—in summing up his year as VCCAR president—applauded his fellow Realtors for what they do.

“Our profession is about supporting home ownership, property rights and the ability of people to engage in a home transaction and move on with their lives. We are here to sell properties, lease properties, to facilitate that and defend that,” Goldstein said. “Our members create wealth and jobs for our communities. And most of this wealth, because of what we do, stays in our community, and this is a point we shouldn’t forget.”

“I feel so profoundly respectful for what you do and what you have accomplished. I think you should give yourselves a pat on the back,” he said.

Ward, who was born and raised in Oxnard, obtained his real estate license in February 2004 and his broker’s license later that year.

In a biography in the installation’s program, Ward describes Comfort Real Estate, which he started on Jan. 1, 2005 as a respected boutique office which currently has 22 agents.

“We love what we do and we have fun doing it,” he said.

Ward was named VCCAR Broker-of-the-Year in 2011 and the Association’s first Chair of its Young Professionals Network in 2010. He notes in the bio that he has become passionate about causes and vocal in his opinions concerning real estate property rights.

“I look forward to a lengthy career in real estate,” he said. “But I know that will only be possible by continuing to have volunteers who will be outspoken on issues … issues that threaten the rights of homeowners, and issue that impact the ability of Realtors to make a living and to provide a valuable service.”
