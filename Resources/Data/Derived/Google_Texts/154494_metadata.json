Ron Young, R-Leroy Township, and the measure would permit a retired health care professional to hold a volunteer\u0092s certificate to provide certain health care services without compensation at any location, including a free clinic, according to a bill summary by the Ohio Legislative Service Commission.\n\nIt also would authorize the state Board of Nursing to issue a volunteer\u0092s certificate to a retired Registered Nurse or licensed practical nurse under specified conditions.\n\nCurrently retired nurses may not obtain a volunteer certificate and therefore cannot practice in a free clinic without having an active license, Young said, adding many would like to serve, but the cost of licensing can be an obstacle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe volunteer certificate would be free and those who obtain one would not be permitted to receive payment for services.\n\nThe legislation would extend a qualified immunity from civil liability to volunteer health care professionals providing services without compensation to individuals eligible for or receiving Medicaid.\n\nIt also would create a state income tax deduction for certain health care professionals and workers who provide volunteer services at free clinics including for mileage to and from free clinics.\n\nYoung said free clinics play a critical role in health care delivery and he discovered there are ways state law could potentially be changed to help them recruit and retain volunteers.\n\n\u0093They help to reduce inappropriate use of hospital emergency rooms and provide critically needed care, which allows many citizens to hold jobs and be productive members of our communities,\u0094 he said.\n\nThe state legislator said free clinics provide life-saving drugs such as insulin for diabetic patients.\n\n\u0093Reduction in illness, sometimes by something as easy as a doctor visit and provision of 10 days\u0092 worth of antibiotics, translates directly to reduction in lost work, lost wages, and lost time from school and sports,\u0094 Young said. \u0093This results in an increase in active participation in our communities, strengthens families, and builds self esteem.\u0094\n\nBecause Medicaid patients sometimes have a problem getting timely access to medical care, the bill allows Medicaid recipients to be treated in a free clinic setting by doctors and nurses that have a Volunteer Certificate, he said.\n\nAs part of the legislation, doctors who volunteer for no pay at free clinics and provide care for Medicaid patients, would be protected from medical malpractice through provisions of the Good Samaritan Act.\n\nThe bill also would create the Free Clinic Appreciation Month each December with the hope that more people would become aware of the contributions free clinics make and encourage them to donate more time and money to make them more successful.\n\nYoung has worked extensively on the legislation with the Lake County Free Clinic in Painesville and the bill has had two hearings in Columbus in the Ohio House of Representatives.\n\nExecutive Director Johanna Henz said her agency at 54 S. State St., treats more than 3,000 people each year and she welcomes the opportunity to make it easier to encourage medical professionals to volunteer their services.\n\nThere are about 50 medical professionals who volunteer to provide services sometimes only as often as once a month or quarterly, Henz said. If more people were able to volunteer then more patients could be helped.\n\n\u0093For every appointment we fill, there are three other people who could use it,\u0094 Henz said. \u0093But it\u0092s hard for a clinic like ours, our staff is very small. We don\u0092t have a person dedicated for volunteer recruitment and retention. It\u0092s part of everyone\u0092s job.\u0094\n\nShe said many retired doctors and nurses decide it\u0092s just not worth the time and expense to pay for everything necessary to be able to volunteer at a free clinic.\n\nThat decision recently came into play for a volunteer dentist who had seen patients two days per month at the free clinic.\n\nHenz said the dentist eventually decided to leave so the Free Clinic currently has just one dentist who visits one day per month.\n\nShe also cautioned there will still be a need for free clinics to provide care when the national Affordable Care Act is implemented because some people will still be uninsured especially if they choose to pay a penalty to not buy insurance or they may not be able to afford their insurance coverage.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "News, Willoughby news, OH news, US news, world news.", "title": "Ohio House Bill aims to encourage medical professionals to volunteer at free clinics", "og": {"url": "http://www.news-herald.com/article/HR/20131203/NEWS/131209765", "image": {"width": "600px", "identifier": "http://www.news-herald.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/HR/20131203/NEWS/131209765/AR/0/AR-131209765.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "486px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Ohio House Bill aims to encourage medical professionals to volunteer at free clinics"}, "twitter": {"domain": "news-herald.com", "description": "Legislation has been introduced in Ohio to encourage medical professionals to volunteer at free clinics and to give patients who qualify for Medicaid greater access to health care options.", "title": "Ohio House Bill aims to encourage medical professionals to volunteer at free clinics", "url": "http://www.news-herald.com/article/HR/20131203/NEWS/131209765", "image": {"src": "http://www.news-herald.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/HR/20131203/NEWS/131209765/AR/0/AR-131209765.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@newsheraldinoh", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id563963169", "iphone": "id520206415", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.newsherald"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "News, Willoughby news, OH news, US news, world news.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "Legislation has been introduced in Ohio to encourage medical professionals to volunteer at free clinics and to give patients who qualify for Medicaid greater access to health care options."}, "article_summary": "It also would create a state income tax deduction for certain health care professionals and workers who provide volunteer services at free clinics including for mileage to and from free clinics.\nLegislation has been introduced in Ohio to encourage medical professionals to volunteer at free clinics and to give patients who qualify for Medicaid greater access to health care options.\nThe legislation would extend a qualified immunity from civil liability to volunteer health care professionals providing services without compensation to individuals eligible for or receiving Medicaid.\nHenz said the dentist eventually decided to leave so the Free Clinic currently has just one dentist who visits one day per month.\nYoung has worked extensively on the legislation with the Lake County Free Clinic in Painesville and the bill has had two hearings in Columbus in the Ohio House of Representatives."}
