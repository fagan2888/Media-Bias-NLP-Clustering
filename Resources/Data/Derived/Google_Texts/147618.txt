FDA Approves Knockoff Version Of Johnson & Johnson’s Remicade

Although the Food and Drug Administration is making a concerted effort to send more biosimilars to market, Inflectra is only the second biosimilar drug to make it on the somewhat bumpy path.

The Associated Press: FDA Approves 1st Cheaper Version Of J&J’s Top Drug Remicade

Federal health officials have approved a cheaper version of Johnson & Johnson’s blockbuster drug, Remicade, a pricey biotech medicine for inflammatory diseases. The approval of Inflectra Tuesday is only the second time that the Food and Drug Administration has approved a quasi-generic biotech drug for the U.S. market. These so-called biosimilar drugs, already available in Europe, have the potential to generate billions of dollars in savings for insurers, doctors and patients in coming years. (Perrone, 4/5)

The Wall Street Journal: FDA Approves Rheumatoid Knockoff

Inflectra is what regulators and the drug industry call a “biosimilar” to J&J’s Remicade, which has been available since 1998 and had U.S. sales of $4.45 billion last year. A biosimilar is a close copy of a biotech drug, which is usually manufactured in living cells rather than synthesized chemically like traditional pills. The FDA last year approved the first biosimilar—a Novartis AG version of Amgen’s Neupogen drug for cancer chemotherapy patients—using new criteria arising from a provision of the 2010 Affordable Care Act aimed at supporting a biosimilar market.
