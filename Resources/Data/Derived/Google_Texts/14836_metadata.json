A bill to ask voters to bond $3.5 billion for transportation projects throughout the state couldn't find traction. Reform to construction defects law, which developers said would spur condo construction in the state, likewise sputtered out.\n\nThe divided Legislature, staring down an election year, didn't find the common ground on those issues, all of which have floated around the public sphere since the last session gaveled out. But Fort Collins' lawmakers also point out that the session wasn't one of sitting on their hands. They point to meeting the Constitutional requirement of passing a balanced budget and, more than that, one that averted the $20 million in cuts initially slated for higher education funding and slightly increased the funding for K-12 education.\n\nELECTIONS: Presidential primary revival falls apart in Colorado\n\nThe three legislators \u2014 Sen. John Kefalas and Reps. Jeni Arndt and Joann Ginal, all Democrats \u2014 shook off the post-session cobwebs to share their accomplishments and the dangling threads they hope to address if voters send them back to Denver next year.\n\nJeni Arndt\n\nRep. Jeni Arndt (Photo: Courtesy photo)\n\nIt took three years, but Arndt finally stewarded through a water bill that began with her predecessor, former Rep. Randy Fischer. The soon-to-be-signed law won't necessarily change the day-to-day for most Coloradans, but it makes an important change to state water law.\n\nIn a nutshell, the law allows those who hold agricultural water rights to temporarily sell those rights without fear of losing them permanently. According to Arndt, that allows farmers more flexibility when planning harvests, as they can switch to a low-water crop for a season or let a field go fallow, and reap market-based benefits from it by turning water over to other users.\n\n\"When we can use water more flexibly, I think that's good for Colorado,\" Arndt said.\n\nArndt said she pulled the companion bill, which would have created a sort of bank for unused water rights, so it could be better streamlined for next session.\n\nShe expressed disappointment over a \"right to rest\" bill that would have allowed camping in any open space in Colorado, but added that the bill wasn't quite there yet. Arndt supports efforts to decriminalize homelessness, but this measure would have essentially let anyone camp anywhere, she said.\n\nELECTION 2016: What Colorado will vote on\n\nAnother bill fell victim to the politics of the session. Arndt ushered a bill through the Democrat-controlled House to add measurable goals to the Colorado Climate Action Plan. Kefalas carried it in the Republican-led Senate, where it failed to make it out of committee.\n\n\"To me that's intuitive \u2014 why have a plan if you don't have goals in it?\" Arndt asked. She added that she may not bring that bill back if its message is heard by stewards of the plan.\n\nArndt is the only local legislator who is unopposed in the November general election.\n\nJohn Kefalas\n\nSen. John Kefalas (Photo: Courtesy photo)\n\nKefalas points to two bills in particular that he worked on that will have tangible impact on people's lives. The first is the so-called employment first bill. In a nutshell, it shifts the goals of state agencies away from essentially just keeping people with intellectual and developmental disabilities occupied and cared for to helping those people find regular employment that helps them integrate into the community and workforce. Ginal carried the bill in the House.\n\n\"That was quite a legislative work of art, in that we didn't think we were going to make it to the governor,\" Kefalas said.\n\nHis second targets veterans, and specifically those veterans most vulnerable to the whims of government. An amendment to the state constitution about a decade ago added disabled veterans to those who qualified for the homestead property tax exemption. But when enabling legislation passed the next year, it excluded military veterans on medical retirement.\n\nCAPITOL HILL: Divided Colorado Legislature wraps year of scant agreement\n\nKefalas also had disappointments, though he finds the silver linings in those as well. A bill to modernize the Colorado Open Records Act and make electronic records available under the open-government law failed in committee but led to a working group and technical group to hash out issues with the bill. An effort to protect mobile home parks' place in the housing conversation \u2014 an effort Kefalas has made for several sessions now \u2014 likewise failed to go anywhere. Nonetheless, Kefalas said he's moved the needle in helping the state Division of Housing understand that mobile homes can play a key role in preserving affordable housing in Fort Collins.\n\nJoann Ginal\n\nRep. Joann Ginal (Photo: Courtesy photo)\n\nGinal arguably took some of the biggest swings this legislative session, pushing several bills that danced perilously close to political third rails. Her End of Life Options Act narrowly passed out of committee this year, though she stopped it short of a floor vote. It was the second year she ran a bill to allow terminally ill patients with a life expectancy of six or fewer months to petition their doctors for life-ending medication.\n\n\"The biggest (disappointment) was the End of Life Options Act,\" Ginal said. \"It had so many people \u2014 and it was a polarizing bill \u2014 but I had so many people supporting it, more than those that were opposed to it.\"\n\nCompassion and Choices, a death-with-dignity advocacy group, is pushing a ballot initiative now. Ginal said she'd rather it go through the Legislature, rather than the constitutional amendment the group wants, so it could be more easily tweaked. If if fails muster at the ballot box, and she succeeds in being re-elected, Ginal plans to bring her bill back.\n\nAnother bill would have forced pharmaceutical companies to reveal the production costs of exorbitantly priced medications. Though it failed to make it out of its House committee, Ginal described it as a successful first step simply for getting stakeholders to the table. She listed off the support of Colorado's county governments, unions and small businesses.\n\nDon't miss a thing Download our apps and get alerts for local news, weather, traffic and more.
