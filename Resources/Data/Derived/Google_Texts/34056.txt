WASHINGTON—Log Cabin Republicans on Dec. 22 criticized an online video that encourages gay men to enroll in the Affordable Care Act.

Gregory T. Angelo, the group’s executive director, described the Out2Enroll video that features muscular men wearing underwear, stuffed reindeer antlers and Santa hats as an “example of the left promoting harmful stereotypes that gay men are nothing more than sex-crazed lechers.”

“As a self-proclaimed ‘fierce advocate’ of gay equality, President Obama would do well to distance himself from this nonsense and denounce it immediately,” said Angelo.

Angelo also referenced the controversy surrounding A&E’s decision to suspend “Duck Dynasty” patriarch Phil Robertson after making homophobic and racist comments during an interview with GQ magazine.

“At a time when left-wing propagandists are decrying ‘Duck Dynasty’s’ Phil Robertson for equating homosexuality with promiscuity and deviance, Out2Enroll and others should take a look in the mirror and ask if the truth is that they are the ones responsible for promoting such harmful stereotypes,” he said.
