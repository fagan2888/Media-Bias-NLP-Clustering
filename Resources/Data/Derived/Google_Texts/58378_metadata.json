After Evans became CEO in 2002, he was an avid dealmaker, engineering mergers with 10 hospitals around the state.\n\n\n\nBut those who know Murphy say his early experiences with family, church and medicine make him exceptionally well-suited to a complex hospital system in swiftly changing times.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe almost has a priestly demeanor,\u201d said Dr. Jay Hess, dean of the IU School of Medicine. \u201cHe\u2019s very calm and thoughtful. He doesn\u2019t get at all upset about anything. In health care, that can be really helpful.\u201d\n\nIU Health President Dennis Murphy visited recently with Methodist Hospital nurses and doctors.

(IBJ photo/Daniel Axler)\n\nIndeed, with all of health care undergoing sweeping changes, Murphy\u2019s tenure at IU Health has seen poor morale among physicians and other staff; a unionization effort by nurses at IU Health\u2019s downtown hospitals, who alleged dangerously low staffing levels; and a controversial decision to consolidate IU Health\u2019s two adult hospitals downtown, Methodist and University.\n\n\n\nIU Health is trying to adapt to new requirements from health care reform, to trim $1 billion in annual operating expenses, and to use lean manufacturing processes to reduce inefficiency.\n\n\n\nDr. Len Henry, head of surgical oncology at the IU Health hospital in Goshen, described the result as a \u201cfrenetic pace of change\u201d and \u201cmetric terrorism.\u201d\n\n\n\nMurphy acknowledges the pace of change has been intense, and chalks up most of the internal dissatisfaction to that fact.\n\n\n\n\u201cPart of this is just the adjustment period,\u201d he said, sitting in his office on the top floor of Fairbanks Hall, the headquarters of both IU Health and the IU School of Medicine, at the head of the Central Canal downtown. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of change for them to digest.\u201d\n\n\n\nMurphy expects more to come.\n\nDennis Murphy is taking the reins of IU Health at a tumultuous time for the health care industry.

(IBJ file photo)\n\nThree changes could all reduce the amount of money IU Health gets paid: the growth of the Obamacare exchanges, where the health insurance policies pay less than employer-based policies; the pending Anthem-Cigna merger, which would likely convert Cigna\u2019s higher-paying rates over to Anthem\u2019s lower rates; and the Obamacare Cadillac tax, which could lead to less spending on health benefits by employers.\n\n\n\nAn even bigger challenge is that IU Health is at a point where it needs to make 50-year upgrades at two hospital campuses\u2014even while the health care system as a whole is shifting so that fewer patients come to big facilities for care but instead are reached near or even in their homes.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat kind of challenge is what you as a health care leader have to face,\u201d Murphy said.\n\n\n\nFacing obstacles\n\n\n\nMurphy, however, isn\u2019t one to complain.\n\n\n\nAs a teenager, he often had to cook his own meals and clean his own laundry during his years at St. Lawrence Seminary High School and during summers working on his relatives\u2019 farm in Ireland.\n\n\n\nIn the year after joining IU Health in July 2013, he put 40,000 miles on his car commuting from Chicago so his eldest son could finish high school. (Some of the miles were logged traveling to IU Health\u2019s 19 hospitals and myriad outpatient facilities around the state.)\n\n\n\nHe now lives in Westfield with his wife, Kristy, and two of their three kids. His eldest son attends the University of Iowa.\n\n\n\nIn August 2014, Murphy tripped and fell one morning while walking and texting on his phone in Fairbanks Hall. He caught himself on his elbow, but broke his arm in seven places.\n\n\n\nHe was taken to the Methodist Hospital emergency room, had 40 pieces of metal inserted into his arm, and went through nine months of physical therapy.\n\n\n\nBut Hess, the medical school dean, can\u2019t remember Murphy complaining about it during the whole time.\n\n\n\nWhen faced with so much change in health care, Murphy thinks back to something he learned at the very start of his career, during a two-year administration fellowship at Johns Hopkins Hospital.\n\n\n\nThat fellowship was led by Steve Lipstein, who is now CEO of the BJC HealthCare system in St. Louis, and who Murphy still consults as a mentor.\n\n\n\nAs Murphy did stints in all parts of the Johns Hopkins system\u2014with nurses, with finance, with human resources\u2014Lipstein stressed that, regardless of the details, the fundamentals always made the difference: high-quality care, patient satisfaction and holding down costs.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you just do those three things really well, the rest will sort itself out,\u201d Murphy said.\n\n\n\nMurphy spent 10 years at Johns Hopkins before Lipstein, who was hired as executive vice president of the University of Chicago hospital system, lured Murphy back to his hometown.\n\n\n\n\u201cDennis is first rate, a leader of many talents,\u201d Lipstein said in an email. \u201cIU Health is fortunate to have him, as Dennis is equally fortunate to lead such an accomplished health system.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe task Lipstein gave Murphy in Chicago was to turn around a money-losing community hospital, Weiss Memorial. He had to renegotiate a series of physician employment contracts that were bleeding cash.\n\n\n\nMurphy said he now leans heavily on that experience, which hammered home the differences between community hospitals and the academic medical centers, where Murphy has spent most of his career.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou learn something everywhere you are,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nLipstein left for St. Louis, but Murphy decided to stay home. In 2000, he joined Northwestern Memorial HealthCare, the health care affiliate of the Northwestern University School of Medicine.\n\n\n\nMurphy played a role in Northwestern\u2019s improving its clinical outcomes, as well as launching a process-improvement initiative in 2006\u2014much like IU Health did in 2012. Murphy also oversaw the planning, construction and opening of a women\u2019s hospital in 2007\u2014which is the third-largest birthing center in the nation.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have any true clinical background, but he really understood the bases of medicine incredibly well,\u201d said Dr. Gary Noskin, chief of medicine at Northwestern Memorial. \u201cIt\u2019s unusual in someone who is not a clinician.\u201d\n\n\n\nNoskin described Murphy as dependable, a good listener, and someone who, although quiet, has an enthusiasm about health care that inspires others.\n\n\n\n\u201cPeople would view him as a friend even if they weren\u2019t close personal friends with him,\u201d Noskin said. \u201cHe possesses that type of warmth.\u201d\n\n\n\nNoskin also remembers Murphy as competitive. That came out one year at an annual leadership retreat, where a team-building exercise required each team to use a golf cart to find items on a scavenger hunt.\n\n\n\nMurphy, who ran sub-4-minute miles during a brief stint on the Notre Dame track team and still runs often, figured out he could run faster than the golf carts could drive. So that\u2019s what he did to get an edge on his co-administrators.\n\n\n\n\u201cEveryone here knew that Dennis was an incredible talent and he was going to become a CEO of a health system,\u201d Noskin said.\n\n\n\nHealthier Hoosiers\n\n\n\nAs Murphy has worked with Hess to develop goals for his tenure as CEO, top on the list has nothing to do with the health of IU Health. Rather, his top focus is on improving the health of Hoosiers.\n\n\n\nMurphy is hardly the first health care executive to say such things. But with research showing that health care affects only 10 percent to 15 percent of a person\u2019s overall health, doctors and hospitals have limited impact.\n\n\n\nMurphy acknowledges that any single health care system\u2014even one with IU Health\u2019s 30 percent statewide market share\u2014can\u2019t improve overall health by itself. But he does think IU Health\u2019s size, as well as Indiana University\u2019s role training the majority of doctors and nurses in the state, gives IU Health a key role to play.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t give you the ability to directly impact those things, but it allows you the ability to be the convener,\u201d Murphy said.\n\n\n\nHe has spent significant time the past two years talking to other hospital system leaders, public officials and health-related groups to try to build a coalition focused on improving health. Specific goals include reducing infant mortality rates, suicide rates and smoking. Hess also mentioned obesity and diabetes.\n\n\n\nMurphy thinks health status is the next key frontier in improving Indiana\u2019s economy.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve created an infrastructure as a state to attract businesses. The next thing is the health of the workforce,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just low taxes. It\u2019s not just receptive laws. It\u2019s, what\u2019s the state of the workforce?\u201d\u2022", "article_metadata": {"description": "Murphy will become CEO of IU Health in April.
