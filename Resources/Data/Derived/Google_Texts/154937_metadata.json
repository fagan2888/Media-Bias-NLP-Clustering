Because of the charges, the judge was unable to set bond, and transferred the case to general sessions where a circuit judge will set Cochran's bond.\n\n\n\nNorth Charleston police arrested Cochran after the early Sunday morning shooting at the North Park Grill on Rivers Avenue.\n\nThe Charleston County Coroner's Office has identified the man killed in the shooting as 24-year-old Michael Knight of Goose Creek, who officials say died from a gunshot wound.\n\nChief Deputy Scott Deckard said officers responded to 8780 Rivers Avenue after receiving reports of a shooting.\n\nThey arrived to find Knight lying in the parking lot, suffering from apparent gunshot wounds. Deckard said the victim was taken to Trident Hospital and died a short time later.\n\n\n\nInvestigators quickly developed a suspect and began looking for him at his home near Crossroads Drive, but he was not there, Deckard said. A short time later, Deckard said a citizen found the suspect hiding in the bushes nearby, and alerted officers.\n\nPolice say the suspect attempted to run and hide, and a taser was used to in order to arrested him.\n\n\n\nDeckard said investigators believe Cochran and Knight were involved in a dispute at the business before the shooting. Authorities have charged Cochran with murder and possession of a firearm during the commission of a violent crime.\n\nCopyright 2013 WCSC.
