Bush, Iraq, TomDispatch.com\n\nThen came the attack of September 11th. Like the starting gun of a race that no one knew he was to run, this explosion set the pack of nations off in a single direction \u2014 toward the trenches. Although the attack was unaccompanied by any claim of authorship or statement of political goals, the evidence almost immediately pointed to al-Qaeda, the radical Islamist, terrorist network, which, though stateless, was headquartered in Afghanistan and enjoyed the protection of its fundamentalist Islamic government. In a tape that was soon shown around the world, the group\u2019s leader, Osama bin Laden, was seen at dinner with his confederates in Afghanistan, rejoicing in the slaughter.\n\nHistorically, nations have responded to terrorist threats and attacks with a combination of police action and political negotiation, while military action has played only a minor role. Voices were raised in the United States calling for a global cooperative effort of this kind to combat al-Qaeda. President Bush opted instead for a policy that the United States alone among nations could have conceivably undertaken: global military action not only against al-Qaeda but against any regime in the world that supported international terrorism.\n\nThe president announced to Congress that he would \u201cmake no distinction between the terrorists who commit these acts and those who harbor them.\u201d By calling the campaign a \u201cwar,\u201d the administration summoned into action the immense, technically revolutionized, post-Cold War American military machine, which had lacked any clear enemy for over a decade. And by identifying the target as generic \u201cterrorism,\u201d rather than as al-Qaeda or any other group or list of groups, the administration licensed military operations anywhere in the world.\n\nIn the ensuing months, the Bush administration continued to expand the aims and means of the war. The overthrow of governments \u2014 \u201cregime change\u201d \u2014 was established as a means for advancing the new policies. The president divided regimes into two categories \u2014 those \u201cwith us\u201d and those \u201cagainst us.\u201d Vice President Cheney estimated that al-Qaeda was active in 60 countries. The first regime to be targeted was of course al-Qaeda\u2019s host, the government of Afghanistan, which was overthrown in a remarkably swift military operation conducted almost entirely from the air and without American casualties.\n\nNext, the administration proclaimed an additional war goal \u2014 preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. In his State of the Union speech in January 2002, the president announced that \u201cthe United States of America will not permit the world\u2019s most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the world\u2019s most destructive weapons.\u201d He went on to name as an \u201caxis of evil\u201d Iraq, Iran, and North Korea \u2014 three regimes seeking to build or already possessing weapons of mass destruction. To stop them, he stated, the Cold War policy of deterrence would not be enough \u2014 \u201cpreemptive\u201d military action would be required, and preemption, the administration soon specified, could include the use of nuclear weapons.\n\nBeginning in the summer of 2002, the government intensified its preparations for a war to overthrow the regime of Saddam Hussein in Iraq, and in the fall, the president demanded and received a resolution from the Security Council of the United Nations requiring Iraq to accept the return of U.N. inspectors to search for weapons of mass destruction or facilities for building them. Lists of other candidates for \u201cregime change\u201d began to surface in the press.\n\nLeaving Cooperative Action Behind\n\nIn this way, the war on terror grew to encompass the most important geopolitical issue facing the world: the disposition of nuclear weapons in the second nuclear age. The Clinton administration had already answered the question regarding American possession of nuclear weapons: even in the absence of the Soviet Union, the United States planned to hold on to its nuclear arsenal indefinitely.\n\nIn 2002, the Bush administration gave an answer to the question regarding nonproliferation, which throughout the nuclear age had been dealt with exclusively by diplomacy and negotiation, or, on occasion, economic sanctions. The new answer was force. Nuclear disarmament was to be achieved by war and threats of war, starting with Iraq. One complementary element of the new policy, embraced long before September 11th, was the decision to build a national missile defense system to protect the United States against nuclear attack by \u201crogue nations.\u201d But the fundamental element was a policy of preemptive war, or \u201coffensive deterrence.\u201d\n\nThis momentous shift in nuclear policy called, in addition, for programs to build new nuclear weapons and new delivery vehicles; confirmed new missions for nuclear weapons \u2014 retaliation for chemical or biological attacks, attacking hardened bunkers unreachable by other weapons \u2014 in the post-Cold War world; and listed seven countries (Russia, China, North Korea, Iraq, Iran, Libya, and Syria) for which contingency plans for nuclear attack should be considered. To achieve all these aims, nuclear and conventional, the president asked for an increase in military spending of $48 billion \u2014 a sum greater than the total military spending of any other nation.\n\nThe sharp turn toward force as the mainstay of the policies of the United States was accompanied by a turn away from treaties and other forms of cooperation. Even before September 11th, the trend had been clear. Now it accelerated. The Bush administration either refused to ratify or withdrew from most of the principal new international treaties of the post-Cold War era. In the nuclear arena alone, the administration refused to submit to the Senate for ratification the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which would have added a ban on underground tests to the existing bans on testing in the air; withdrew from the A.B.M. Treaty, which had severely limited Russian and American deployment of antinuclear defensive systems; and jettisoned the START negotiations as the framework for nuclear reductions with Russia \u2014 replacing them with the Strategic Offensive Reduction Agreement, a three-page document requiring two-thirds of the strategic weapons of both sides to be removed from their delivery vehicles, but then stored rather than dismantled.\n\nIn addition, the Bush administration withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which had become the world\u2019s principal forum for making decisions about reducing emissions that cause global warming; refused to ratify the Rome treaty establishing an international criminal court; and declined to agree to an important protocol for inspection and enforcement of a U.N. convention banning biological weapons.\n\nThe consequences of this revolution in American policy rippled through the world, where it found ready imitators. On December 12th, the Indian Parliament was attacked by terrorists whom India linked to Pakistan. Promptly, nuclear-armed India, citing the American policy of attacking not only terrorists but any state that harbored them, moved half a million men to the border of nuclear-armed Pakistan, which responded in kind, producing the first full-scale nuclear crisis of the twenty-first century.\n\nIn South Asia, nuclearization did not produce the cautionary effects that the theorists of deterrence expected. High Indian officials openly threatened Pakistan with annihilation. Rajnath Singh, the minister for the state of Uttar Pradesh, declared, \u201cIf Pakistan doesn\u2019t change its ways, there will be no sign of Pakistan left,\u201d and when India\u2019s army chief, General S. Padmanabhan, was asked how India would respond if attacked with a nuclear weapon, he answered that \u201cthe perpetrator of that particular outrage shall be punished so severely that their continuation thereafter in any form of fray will be doubtful.\u201d In Pakistan, the dictator General Pervez Musharraf stated that, in the event of an Indian conventional invasion of Pakistan, \u201cas a last resort, the atom bomb is also possible.\u201d In March 2002, Israel, citing the same American precedent and calling for U.S. support for its policy on this basis, responded to Palestinian suicide bombings by launching its own \u201cwar on terrorism\u201d \u2014 a full-scale attack on the Palestinian Authority on the West Bank.\n\nThe revolution in American policy had been precipitated by September 11th, but went far beyond any war on terror. It remained to give the policy comprehensive doctrinal expression, which came in an official document, \u201cThe National Security Strategy of the United States of America,\u201d issued in September 2002. In the world, it stated, only one economic and political system remained \u201cviable\u201d: the American one of liberal democracy and free enterprise. The United States would henceforth promote and defend this system by the unilateral use of force \u2014 preemptively, if necessary. The United States, the president said, \u201chas, and intends to keep, military strengths beyond challenge, thereby making the destabilizing arms races of other eras pointless, and limiting rivalries to trade and other pursuits of peace.\u201d\n\nIn other words, the United States reserved the entire field of military force to itself, restricting other nations to humbler pursuits. In the words of the \u201cNational Security Strategy,\u201d \u201cOur forces will be strong enough to dissuade potential adversaries from pursuing a military build-up in hopes of surpassing, or equaling, the power of the United States.\u201d If the United States was displeased with a regime, it reserved the right to overthrow it \u2014 to carry out \u201cregime change.\u201d \u201cIn the world we have entered,\u201d President Bush has said, \u201cthe only path to safety is the path of action. And this nation will act.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "After 9/11, people rightly said the world had changed forever.
