Each case is linked to bean sprouts from Wonton Foods in Brooklyn, New York, according to the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe last shipment of bean sprouts went out Tuesday. As of Friday, the company agreed to voluntarily stop the production and sale of its bean sprouts and take steps to prevent salmonella.\n\nIllnesses linked to the bean sprouts were reported between Sept. 30 and Nov. 8 in Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, Montana, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Vermont. Eleven people have been hospitalized, but none in New Hampshire, officials said.\n\n\u201cThe Division of Public Health Services will continue to investigate to identify any other potential cases and has notified the New Hampshire Grocers Association and the New Hampshire Restaurant and Lodging Association so that the product is removed from consumption,\u201d said Dr. Jose Montero, New Hampshire\u2019s director of public health. \u201cSprouts are a known source of food-borne illness, so if you are not sure of the origin of any sprouts, it is best to throw them out rather than risk consuming a contaminated product.\u201d\n\nSalmonella causes diarrhea, fever and abdominal cramps usually 12 to 72 hours after infection. The illness usually lasts four to seven days, and most people recover without treatment.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health", "ib-analytics": "data", "item-publish-date": "Sat, 22 Nov 2014 12:27:59 EST", "generator": "ibPublish 2", "author": "David Pierce", "og": {"site_name": "WMUR", "description": "Four people in New Hampshire have been linked to a multi-state outbreak of salmonella, state health officials said.", "title": "Four New Hampshire salmonella cases linked to multi-state outbreak", "url": "http://www.wmur.com/health/four-new-hampshire-salmonella-cases-linked-to-multistate-outbreak/29878878", "image": "http://www.wmur.com/image/view/-/17655246/highRes/1/-/maxh/630/maxw/1200/-/xlnkxk/-/GENERIC-medical-jpg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.wmur.com/health/four-new-hampshire-salmonella-cases-linked-to-multistate-outbreak/29878878", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "wmur://content/article/29878878", "iphone": "wmur://content/article/29878878", "googleplay": "wmur://content/article/29878878"}, "name": {"ipad": "wmur", "iphone": "wmur", "googleplay": "wmur"}, "id": {"ipad": 504646663, "iphone": 504646663, "googleplay": "com.hearst.android.wmur"}}, "site": "@wmur9", "card": "app"}, "al": {"android": {"url": "wmur://content/article/29878878", "app_name": "wmur", "package": "com.hearst.android.wmur"}, "ios": {"url": "wmur://content/article/29878878", "app_store_id": 504646663, "app_name": "wmur"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 98665743246}, "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.wmur.com/health/four-new-hampshire-salmonella-cases-linked-to-multistate-outbreak/29878878"}, "keywords": "New Hampshire, Wonton Foods, salmonella outbreak, bean sprouts", "google-site-verification": "xTJFxn8Gm6mXV5ugnbTb198craV_CkoMGMqQyL4EfS4", "news_keywords": "New Hampshire, Wonton Foods, salmonella outbreak, bean sprouts", "description": "Four people in New Hampshire have been linked to a multi-state outbreak of salmonella, state health officials said."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc9bb\"", "article_summary": "Four people in New Hampshire have been linked to a multi-state outbreak of salmonella, state health officials said.\nEleven people have been hospitalized, but none in New Hampshire, officials said.\nEach case is linked to bean sprouts from Wonton Foods in Brooklyn, New York, according to the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services.\nAs of Friday, the company agreed to voluntarily stop the production and sale of its bean sprouts and take steps to prevent salmonella.\nThe last shipment of bean sprouts went out Tuesday."}
