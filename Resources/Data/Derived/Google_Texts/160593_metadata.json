Nearly 500,000 viewers tuned in live as YouTube creators Hank Green, GloZell, and Bethany Mota sat down for one-on-one interviews that covered topics from education and gridlock in Washington, to Cuba policy and how to get more young people engaged in politics.\n\nDuring the event, President Obama signed something special for Hank Green: a picture of him holding a pharmacy receipt. \"I have a chronic condition,\" Hank said, \"and it's expensive to manage. But before I had insurance I could not take this medication. It's about $1,100 a month. And that is a receipt showing the $5 a month. So Obamacare has worked for me. So thanks for that.\"\n\nBethany Mota, a 19-year-old with a younger online audience, asked the President about why the younger generation should get involved in politics. Here's what he said:\n\nThere is no decision in our lives basically that isn\u2019t touched in some way by the laws that we have. And we\u2019re really lucky that we live in a democracy where our voice matters...It\u2019s as simple as this: You decide you guys want to go see a movie and you got a group of friends, and somehow you got to figure out which movie you\u2019re going to go see, because not everybody is going to agree all the time. And you\u2019re going to have to have a debate and you\u2019re going to have to make an argument, and then eventually you\u2019re going to have to compromise -- otherwise you guys aren\u2019t going to be hanging out together too much. Well, the same is true for our country. We\u2019ve got to make decisions about which direction we\u2019re going to go on in, what we\u2019re going to be doing, how we\u2019re going to spend our money, how we\u2019re going to treat each other. And you don\u2019t want to be the person who just says, okay, whatever you guys want to do, I\u2019ll just do that. You want to express your voice and your values and what you care about. And that\u2019s what politics is. It\u2019s not really that complicated, it\u2019s just -- it\u2019s something that people do all the time with their friends and with their family. And they negotiate, they compromise, they try to figure out how do we live together. And this is just done at a national level. And some of the issues get pretty complicated, but usually the values are the same ones that you talk about all the time: how do we treat each other with kindness; how do we look after one another; how are we fair to each other. I think that young people usually have good instincts, but sometimes they just get turned off by all the noise and yelling on TV, and that\u2019s not how politics has to be.\n\nWatch the full interview here, and stay tuned for videos from Hank, GloZell, and Bethany about their interview with the President and trip to D.C.\n\nWe're here! @glozell @hankgreen Une photo publi\u00e9e par Bethany Noel Mota (@bethanynoelm) le Janv. 22, 2015 at 11:27 PST\n\nStep 1: Meet Bo and Sunny Step 2: Meet President Obama #YouTubeAsksObama pic.twitter.com/ArO7Hi2L5p \u2014 YouTube (@YouTube) January 22, 2015\n\nIt's gettin' real!! youtube.com/whitehouse in less than 2 hours!!
