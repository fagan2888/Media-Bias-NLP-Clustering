I consider him a friend. I wanted his take on the Republican candidates because I felt I needed a reality check. Was I becoming excessively crotchety and partisan, or are these people really as weird as they seem? We got right into it:\n\nMe: \u201cSo what do really you think of these candidates?\u201d\n\nHim: \u201cYou want my unvarnished opinion?\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cPlease. That\u2019s why I called.\u201d\n\nHim: \u201cThey\u2019re all nuts.\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cSeriously. What do you really think of them?\u201d\n\nHim: \u201cI just told you. They\u2019re bonkers. Bizarre. They\u2019re like a Star Wars bar room.\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cHow did it happen? How did your party manage to come up with this collection?\u201d\n\nHim: \u201cWe didn\u2019t. They came up with themselves. There\u2019s no party any more. It\u2019s chaos. Anybody can just decide they want to be the Republican nominee, and make a run for it. Carson? Trump? They\u2019re in the lead and they\u2019re both out of their f*cking minds.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"Carson? Trump?
