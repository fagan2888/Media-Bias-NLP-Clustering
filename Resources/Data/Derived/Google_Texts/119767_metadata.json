Matt Prater, the Broncos\u2019 Pro Bowl kicker, does this trampoline-like leap before every kickoff.\n\n\u201cI started doing it because it helps me loosen up my legs, get the juices flowing a little bit,\u201d Prater said. \u201cI go back to 10 yards, and then I do the jump before I move 5 over. It helps me loosen up. I just jump, bring my knees up \u2014 and try not to fall down.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not sure if it\u2019ll take off like \u201cTebowing,\u201d but as seen in this video below, I have created \u201cPratering\u201d (though, to be fair, I sort of just look like Costanza).\n\n\n\nAs for Prater, he\u2019s a weapon. I think some people just take for granted how efficient he is. He\u2019s as close to automatic as the NFL has \u2014 he was 25-for-26 this season on field-goal attempts, while scoring a franchise record 150 points.\n\nHe\u2019s a stud. He owns the best field-goal percentage from 50-plus yards since the NFL merger; he\u2019s 21-for-27. And, of course, he set the NFL record with a 64-yard kick this season. Here\u2019s my column from that day about Prater and his lucky boots.\n\nAnd that\u2019s all from me \u2014 I need to go ice my hamstring after my ill-fated Pratering.\n\nBenjamin Hochman: bhochman@denverpost.com or twitter.com/hochman\n\n\n\nVisit denverpost.com each weekday near quittin\u2019 time for a heavy pour of sports commentary from Denver Post columnist Benjamin Hochman.
