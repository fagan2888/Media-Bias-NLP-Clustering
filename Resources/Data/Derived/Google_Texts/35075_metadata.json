That means the co-op gets only $800,000.\n\nA spokesman for PacificSource said it hadn\u2019t budgeted for the payments anyways, so losing them won\u2019t affect its bottom line.\n\nPacificSource, which covers about 10,000 people on individual policies in Montana, had requested nearly $7 million in payments for policies in Montana, Oregon and Idaho, but will receive just $1 million, said Todd Lovshin, the company\u2019s Montana vice president.\n\nBlue Cross and Blue Shield of Montana, the third company selling policies on Montana\u2019s marketplace, refused Monday to release any information on its loss of \u201crisk-corridor\u201d payments from the federal government.\n\nThe company would issue only a statement saying it\u2019s \u201cworking internally and with our external partners to assess the implications.\u201d Blue Cross insures about 22,000 people on policies sold via the marketplace.\n\nThe Obama administration announced Oct. 1 it would not pay $2.5 billion requested by insurers nationwide in risk-corridor payments for 2014 \u2013 about 88% of what the companies had asked.\n\nThe payments help companies cover losses that exceed the premiums they charged for marketplace policies sold in 2014 \u2013 the first year such policies became available, as part of the federal health-care overhaul.\n\nIt\u2019s also uncertain whether these payments will be made for 2015 and 2016.\n\nDworak said the loss of 88% of the 2014 payments may sink some of the new, state-based nonprofit health insurance co-ops created and financed by the ACA.\n\nThe Montana co-op, which lost $3 million last year, is not in danger of folding, he said, because it has maintained strong reserves and did not expand too quickly.\n\n\u201cWe kept our costs down,\u201d Dworak said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been very conservative. That\u2019s kind of saved the day for us, for now.\u201d\n\nThe cut in payments stems from a budget deal worked out in Congress, in which Republicans insisted the program be \u201crevenue neutral,\u201d which they knew would mean less money for insurers, he added.\n\nInsurers will be watching and waiting to see what happens to the money for 2015 and 2016, he said.\n\nLovshin said PacificSource also played it cautious in this new market, not counting on any payments.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve positioned ourselves in our rate filings and our overall accounting practices to not depend on these (risk-corridor) payments,\u201d he said. \u201cWe feel pretty fortunate that we are taking the course that we took.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Health insurers selling individual policies on Montana\u2019s \u201cmarketplace\u201d will be shorted millions of dollars in federal payments this year.
