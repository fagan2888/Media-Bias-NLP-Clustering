They have been Ryder Cup partners for all but one session dating to 2010 at Wales, though their record is hardly impressive. They have won only two of those matches and halved another.\n\n\u201cThree or four months ago, I had a very strong view that they would have been (partners),\u201d McGinley said. \u201cBut the more I look at their statistics, and the more I look at the different value I have with them, I\u2019m thinking there may be a value in not doing it. But if I don\u2019t do it, it certainly won\u2019t be because of any issues.\n\n\u201cAs both of them have said, there are no issues between them and both will be happy to play together,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it will be my decision ultimately.\u201d\n\nBoth teams arrived at Gleneagles on a relatively quiet day in which a haircut attracted most of the attention.\n\nRickie Fowler, a teen idol in golf circles, stepped off the U.S. charter at Edinburgh with \u201cUSA\u201d cut into the side of his hair. Even old-school Tom Watson, the 65-year-old American captain, liked it.\n\n\u201cI thought it was terrific,\u201d Watson said. \u201cIt brings a light spirit to the team.\u201d\n\nThe Americans flew overnight as a team, and planned little more than chipping and putting Monday before getting started on their practice rounds. Watson has reminded them from his vast experience \u2014 only three American players were even born when Watson played his first Ryder Cup in 1977 \u2014 not to worry if it takes a few days for their golf games to come around.\n\nHalf of the European team lives in Florida and players began arriving in the U.K. over the last week.\n\nMcIlroy left Horizon more than a year ago and their lawsuit is scheduled to go to trial as early as January. An Irish judge has recommended that both sides go through mediation because of sensitive material that would be public. Among other things, McIlroy has alleged that McDowell received more favorable contract terms from Horizon, and McIlroy\u2019s lawyers have requested confidential documents.\n\nMcDowell announced last week that he also was leaving Horizon, under amicable terms, to put his own team around him.\n\nThey said they remain close and even had dinner together in Denver earlier this month.\n\nMcIlroy has had only one other partner in his two Ryder Cups. He was with Ian Poulter in fourballs in the final session at Medinah two years ago, and it was memorable. Poulter birdied his last five holes to give Europe an improbable point, and plenty of momentum that carried the side to a stunning comeback to retain the cup.\n\nThat has become a focal point for the American side.\n\n\u201cI made it very clear to them that this trip is a redemption trip,\u201d Watson said. \u201cThose players that played on that team, it\u2019s time to make amends and try to redeem yourselves from what happened in 2012. I think it\u2019s a motivation rather than a negative.\u201d\n\nEurope is considered a favorite, and McGinley believes that to be a badge of honor instead of a burden.\n\n\u201cWe have been favorites before,\u201d said McGinley, who has never been part of a losing Ryder Cup team as a player or vice captain. \u201cAnd I think our players deserved it. The guys have worked very hard to be in the position they are.\u201d\n\nEven so, he has implored his team not to read too much into it. Europe has won only three of the last 13 sessions dating to 2008, and just two sessions in the last two Ryder Cups they won. The matches have been close, and the rosters of both teams indicated Gleneagles could be another replay of that.\n\n\u201cThis is not a weak American team,\u201d McGinley said. \u201cWe might be slight favorites with the bookies, but the two teams are very well balanced and very close together. We know it\u2019s going to be a very tough contest ahead of us.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "McDowell and McIlroy are longtime friends and major champions.
