The premature birth rates decrease to 11.4 percent in the United States. The proportion of premature rates dropped each year since 2005. This kind of continuous decline is observed first time in the last two decades.

March of Dimes, a non-profit organization unveils this data in its report on Thursday. The organization informed that preterm birth rates decreased in the last seven years. It is certainly one of the chief goals of the “Healthy people” is to cut down the rate of premature deliveries till 9.6 percent in 2020. The basic purpose of this goal is to improve the health of mothers and babies.

As per the reports, almost 542,000 pre-mature deliveries took place in 2013. However, the number is declined to 450,000 last year.

Moreover, the data reveals that this decline happens due to the constant struggles of the entire country

Moreover, the fall in pre-mature deliveries also affected the total cost of deliveries. The healthcare department of the United States has approximately saved $11.9 billion in 2013. The primary reason is the decline in premature births since it is relatively expensive than the normal deliveries. The expense of a normal delivery is $4,000, whereas the cost of premature delivery is nearly $54,000.

Dr. Jennifer L Howse, head of March of Dimes stated that the most recent figures are certainly really good news for everyone. However, the ratio of premature birth should decrease more.
