We will see more folks interfering in women\u2019s private decisions about our health care. We\u2019ll see more opposition to raising the minimum wage and ensuring access to health care for hard-working folks.\u201d\n\nJust before saying this, \u201cAnd here is what I want you to remember: Those kids, our kids, are counting on us to stand up for them this November. And there are so many of these kids all over the country who I meet every day who are counting on us. Kids like a young man named Lawrence Lawson who I met earlier this year.\u201c\n\nApparently to Michelle Obama, supporting pro-abortion candidates such as her husband and Mike Michaud is somehow supporting kids.\n\nShe was joined by Planned Parenthood president, Cecile Richards to support Democratic candidate for governor Mike Michaud at the University of Maine on Friday night.\n\nIn her speech, the First Lady gave a shout out to the abortion giant prez,\u201d And I also want to give a big hello to Cecile Richards who has been such a strong, passionate advocate for women and families across this country \u2014 and I\u2019m thrilled \u2014 it was a pleasure, I know for all of you, to hear from her today,\u201d said Michelle Obama.\n\nCecile Richards\u2019speech was typical political jargon where she begins by giving a salute back to Michelle Obama, Planned Parenthood Action, and then says this, \u201cI am so honored to be here today on behalf of the three million patients who count on Planned Parenthood each year for health care\u2026.for cancer screenings, for birth control, for breast cancer exams, and yes for safe and legal abortion.\u201d\n\nRichards then bemoaned the recent decision by the Fifth Circuit Court to allow strict pro-life regulations to go forward closing several abortion clinics in Texas, \u201cWe have seen the dangerous results of politicians putting their own personal agenda ahead of the rights of women to access health care that they need. And, what we\u2019ve seen in Texas is that dozens of women\u2019s health centers [ abortion clinics] have closed\u2026and that\u2019s simply because the legislature and our Governor put their own political ambitions ahead of women\u2019s ability to make their own private medical health care decisions\u2026\u201d\n\nHow exactly is killing an unborn child now considered health care?\n\nMike Michaud clearly supports abortion on demand and writes this on his campaign website:\n\nWomen\u2019s Health Issues:\n\nNot only must we work to increase access to affordable health care for women and families, but we must also ensure that in doing so, women have access to a full range of reproductive health care options and family planning services. This includes access to contraception, maternity and newborn care, and safe abortion services. That is why I have supported public funding for family planning services and fought to ensure that emergency contraception is readily available to women on military bases.

As governor, I will veto any bill that attempts to weaken Maine\u2019s Reproductive Privacy Act or infringes on a woman\u2019s right to choose. I will also oppose any attempt to restrict access the full range of healthcare services\u2013including abortion\u2013provided under the Affordable Care Act I supported in Congress. Decisions about whether to choose adoption, end a pregnancy, or raise a child must be left to a woman, her family and her faith, with the counsel of her health care provider. Like many Americans, my views on abortion have evolved over the years. Thanks to the countless women who have shared their stories and concerns with me while I\u2019ve been in office, it\u2019s become clear to me that a woman\u2019s decision to end her pregnancy is a decision that only she can make. I\u2019m proud to say I now have a 100 percent rating from NARAL \u2013 the nation\u2019s leading organization for women\u2019s reproductive rights \u2013 as well as a 92 percent lifetime rating with Planned Parenthood. Women don\u2019t turn to politicians for advice about birth control, mammograms, cancer screenings or treatments. So, politicians should not be involved in a woman\u2019s personal medical decisions about her pregnancy.\n\nLifeNews Note: Carole Novielli is the author of the blog Saynsumthn, where this article originally appeared.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Michelle Obama Joins Planned Parenthood Prez to Campaign for Pro-Abortion Candidate", "og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "Michelle Obama joined a campaign rally for a pro-abortion Democratic gubernatorial candidate in the state of Maine.
