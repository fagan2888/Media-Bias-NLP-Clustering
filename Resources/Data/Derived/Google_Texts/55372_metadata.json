Nicholas \u201cNick\u201d Mattiello, D-Cranston, speaker of the Rhode Island House of Representatives.\n\nMattiello has a reputation as being friendly to union causes.\n\nCritics also note that he and his brother lease office space to Cranston Firefighters Local 1633 in a building they co-own. The local union is affiliated with the International Association of Firefighters.\n\nMattiello, first elected to the House in 2007, has declined to reveal how much he makes in rent from Local 1633.\n\nBut the speaker has said the arrangement causes no conflict of interest and that he separates his business relationship with Local 1633 from his legislative duties.\n\n\u201cWe are a part-time legislature and many of us are active in the business world,\u201d Mattiello told the news site GoProvLocal. \u201cI am not going to give up a tenant because I was elected to the General Assembly.\u201d\n\nBut on the subject of overtime, he certainly sought to do the bidding of firefighters unions\u2014at the expense, detractors say, of the taxpayers he is sworn to serve.\n\nThe case involves how firefighters are scheduled to work. Most states use the \u201cthree-platoon system,\u201d in which firefighters work a 24-hour shift, then take 48 hours off.\n\nRhode Island\u2019s career firefighters use a four-platoon system, in which firefighters typically work two 10-hour day shifts, then two 14-hour night shifts, then get 96 hours off.\n\nThis means a third more firefighters and higher expenses for salaries, benefits, and related costs.\n\nIn 2012, the town of North Kingston attempted to go to the three-platoon system, in line with public sentiment, but union leaders sued to block the move. North Kingston prevailed, however, when the state Supreme Court overturned a lower court ruling in June.\n\nIn Rhode Island, the office of governor is largely a ceremonial position. The power lies with leaders in the General Assembly\u2019s House and Senate.\n\nAnd Mattiello set about using his power after the high court\u2019s decision, introducing one bill to allow higher overtime costs by gutting the North Kingston ruling and another measure mandating retention of the more expensive four-platoon system.\n\nNeither bill attracted much support, and the speaker pulled them in June before they could come up for a vote.\n\nThese were no ordinary pieces of legislation, either, says Ken Block, a software engineer, business leader, and activist in Barrington, R.I.\n\n\u201cThese bills were introduced at very last minute and they were introduced in ways that were well outside of the House rules for the submittal of a bill,\u201d Block says:\n\nThis could not have happened without the speaker, and he is 100 percent conflicted since he rents office space to the firefighters union in Cranston. These were horrible bills and the fact the House speaker and unions lost this one says that people are paying attention.\n\nRhode Island residents called and wrote to lawmakers, showed up for meetings, and sent letters to newspapers and other media outlets.\n\nThe Daily Signal sought comment from Mattiello and from union leaders, but they did not respond.\n\nMattiello, however, told talk radio station WPRO that his stand in favor of pension reform did not endear him to unions. He said:\n\nEverything I\u2019ve ever done has been to serve the public\u2019s interest. I\u2019m not going to give up a private tenant in a difficult economy to serve someone\u2019s personal mean spirited agenda.\n\nPaul Valletta, head of the Cranston local as well as lobbyist at the statehouse for the Rhode Island Association of Firefighters, told GoLocalProv he agreed with Mattiello that lawmakers hadn\u2019t especially done the bidding of fire departments since he was elected speaker in March 2014.\n\nDoes Mattiello\u2019s retreat mean things have changed in Rhode Island, where unions traditionally have political clout, and taxpayers\u2019 interests will begin to prevail?\n\nIt\u2019s too early for taxpayers to celebrate, Block says.\n\n\u201cThese overtime bills were ridiculous,\u201d he says, arguing that the measures conflicted with federal law by requiring overtime pay for firefighters after 42 hours rather than after 53 hours.\n\nOn the other hand, the nation\u2019s smallest state has an independent streak. It was not only the first to declare independence from the British crown, but the last to sign on to the U.S. Constitution because it demanded that a Bill of Rights first be attached.\n\n\u201cYes, that\u2019s a proud history,\u201d says Fred Gralinsky, who is president of the Central Coventry Fire District board and opposed the union on the legislation. \u201cBut remember, we also have a history of organized crime in this state, and I\u2019m worried that this is something that still infects the culture.\u201d\n\nBlock agrees, and says he is encouraged by what he considers the defeat of Mattiello\u2019s bills.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to think that the people are beginning to rise up and challenge abusive practices,\u201d Block says. \u201cThere was such outrage over these overtime bills, and for once the elected officials stepped back and listened to the people. I\u2019d like to keep that momentum going.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Taxpayers won a battle with government workers unions when a top Rhode Island politicians withdrew measures to financially rewarded career firefighters.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Taxpayers won a battle with government workers unions when a top Rhode Island politicians withdrew measures to financially rewarded career firefighters.", "title": "Did Powerful State Official Overreach on Firefighter Overtime?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150817_RISpeaker_1_Mooney.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-08-20T11:13:00+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1gRhjjh"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Taxpayers won a battle with government workers unions when a top Rhode Island politicians withdrew measures to financially rewarded career firefighters.", "title": "Did Powerful State Official Overreach on Firefighter Overtime?", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150817_RISpeaker_1_Mooney.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "labor,taxes", "published_time": "2015-08-19T03:01:36+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-20T11:13:00+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Nicholas Mattiello,  Nick Mattiello, Rhode Island Association of Firefighters, Paul Valletta, Rhode Island fire departments, Rhode Island firefighters, Cranston Firefighters Local 1633, International Association of Firefighters, Central Coventry Fire District"}, "article_summary": "Critics also note that he and his brother lease office space to Cranston Firefighters Local 1633 in a building they co-own.\nRhode Island residents called and wrote to lawmakers, showed up for meetings, and sent letters to newspapers and other media outlets.\nSo they called on Rep.
