The curriculum is designed so students can complete the required coursework in three years for the MBA/MS in Biochemistry, and 2\u00bd years for the MBA/MS Medical in Physiology.\n\nThe new dual degrees target an increasingly vital space in the job market, where translational science and business share common ground.\n\n\u201cAnybody with this dual degree is going to be extraordinarily marketable,\u201d said Professor Thomas M. Nosek in the Department of Physiology and Biophysics, who helped orchestrate the new programs.\n\nNosek and Biochemistry Professor William Merrick each met with Associate Professor Simon Peck, in Weatherhead School of Management\u2019s Department of Design & Innovation, to design the dual degrees. Peck is Weatherhead\u2019s associate dean for MBA programs.\n\nMerrick expects the dual degree to open career possibilities for biochemistry students seeking options outside of medical school, and for future medical students who realize studying business management will be valuable long-term.\n\n\u201cIn our program,\u201d Merrick said, \u201cyou can blend the study of bioscience and an MBA very easily. I see this as another opportunity for our students to enhance what they want to do.\u201d\n\nPeck said graduate students in physiology and biochemistry might be interested in entrepreneurship, the pharmaceutical industry and a range of other health-care business possibilities \u201cthat make a link-up with an MBA program a no-brainer.\u201d\n\nPeck said the new degree offerings are a direct response to a dynamic health-care environment. Ongoing changes are spawning:\n\n\uf06e A growth in medical entrepreneurship and startups.\n\n\uf06e Expansion in the medical device industry.\n\n\uf06e A need for health care consulting.\n\n\uf06e Demand for biomedical/business management, as the nation adapts to the Affordable Care Act.\n\nDual degrees are more efficient, as they allow students to complete both degrees simultaneously rather than separately. As a result, some credit hours in each program can count as electives in the other. This sharing of credits means students often earn two degrees a year earlier than they could otherwise. The MBA/MS in Medical Physiology also offers an alternative for the first year, in which students can take the medical/science coursework online.\n\nThe dual degree option allows MBA students at the Weatherhead School the ability to enhance their professional credentials with science courses usually reserved for biomedical studies, once prerequisites for the sciences coursework are satisfied.\n\n\n\nCapitalizing on Cleveland\u2019s position as a global center for large research hospitals and biomedical start-ups, the Weatherhead School also offers a master\u2019s degree in health care management as an evening program for working professionals.\n\nReporters: follow Looking for a different expert?
