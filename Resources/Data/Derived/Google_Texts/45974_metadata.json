The husband-and-wife team killed 14 and seriously injured 22 in the December shooting at Inland Regional Center.\n\nAlthough a neighbor observed suspicious activities by the couple and visitors to their home, the neighbor was \u201cafraid of being called a racist\u201d and declined to speak out, Borelli told the audience at the Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC.\n\nSyed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik, who lived in the town of Redlands, were killed in a shootout with police officers after their attack on a holiday party for employees with the San Bernardino County Department of Public Health, where Farook worked.\n\nThe attack may not have taken place in the first place, Borelli suggested, if concerned citizens had not succumbed to political correctness.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m tired of the race card being played,\u201d she said.\n\nThe CPAC panel, entitled \u201cGreatest National Security Challenge Facing the Next President,\u201d took a hard look at how the policies of President Barack Obama undermined America\u2019s economic posture at home and how domestic failures contributed to the nation\u2019s inability to confront external threats and project power abroad.\n\nBorelli quoted Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan, both presidents who warned that America more likely would be destroyed from within than without.\n\nReagan said: \u201cFreedom is never more than one generation away from extinction. We didn\u2019t pass it to our children in the bloodstream. It must be fought for, protected, and handed on for them to do the same, or one day we will spend our sunset years telling our children and our children\u2019s children what it was once like in the United States where men were free.\u201d\n\nRep. Ryan Zinke, R-Mont., warned that America\u2019s retreat from the world has \u201ccreated a vacuum\u201d that is being filled by China in the Asian-Pacific region and by Russia in the Middle East.\n\nZinke said the Obama administration\u2019s nuclear deal with Iran puts the terrorist state in a stronger position to develop intercontinental ballistic missiles that could be equipped with nuclear weapons.\n\nAs a result of Obama\u2019s policies, \u201cour enemies don\u2019t fear us, and our allies don\u2019t trust us,\u201d Zinke said.\n\nJames Carafano, a top national security and foreign policy analyst with The Heritage Foundation, said Obama\u2019s policies are \u201ctailor-made\u201d to play into the hands of America\u2019s worst enemies.\n\n\u201cThe goal of our enemies is to win without fighting and to incrementally walk us away [from areas of influence],\u201d Carafano said.\n\nCarafano cited Heritage\u2019s Index of Economic Freedom, which has the U.S. experiencing a precipitous drop in its ranking during the Obama years.\n\nK.T. McFarland, a national security analyst for Fox News Channel, served as moderator. She invoked Reagan\u2019s famous refrain of \u201cpeace through strength.\u201d\n\n\u201cReagan chose these words carefully,\u201d McFarland said. \u201cPeace wasn\u2019t just the absence of war, and strength wasn\u2019t just the strength of our military, but also the strength of our economy.\u201d\n\nRunning through Saturday, CPAC offers conservatives across the country an opportunity to gather with fellow activists and leaders for speeches, panels, exhibits, and other activities at Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center, just outside Washington, D.C., at Maryland\u2019s National Harbor.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A neighbor of the San Bernardino killers was \u201cafraid of being called a racist\u201d and didn't speak out on her suspicion, journalist-writer Doreen Borelli says.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A neighbor of the San Bernardino killers was \u201cafraid of being called a racist\u201d and didn't speak out on her suspicion, journalist-writer Doreen Borelli says.", "title": "Does Political Correctness Create National Security Openings?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160303PCKills_Mooney.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-03-05T16:49:45+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1RKDi9o"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A neighbor of the San Bernardino killers was \u201cafraid of being called a racist\u201d and didn't speak out on her suspicion, journalist-writer Doreen Borelli says.", "title": "Does Political Correctness Create National Security Openings?", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160303PCKills_Mooney.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Security", "tag": "terrorism", "published_time": "2016-03-03T12:22:37+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-05T16:49:45+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Deneen Borelli, CPAC, national security, Barack Obama, Ronald Reagan, Conservative Political Action Conference, terrorism, San Bernardino, Ryan Zinke, Greatest National Security Challenge Facing the Next President"}, "article_summary": "McFarland, a national security analyst for Fox News Channel, served as moderator.\nJames Carafano, a top national security and foreign policy analyst with The Heritage Foundation, said Obama\u2019s policies are \u201ctailor-made\u201d to play into the hands of America\u2019s worst enemies.\nThe attack may not have taken place in the first place, Borelli suggested, if concerned citizens had not succumbed to political correctness.\nThe husband-and-wife team killed 14 and seriously injured 22 in the December shooting at Inland Regional Center.\nAs a result of Obama\u2019s policies, \u201cour enemies don\u2019t fear us, and our allies don\u2019t trust us,\u201d Zinke said."}
