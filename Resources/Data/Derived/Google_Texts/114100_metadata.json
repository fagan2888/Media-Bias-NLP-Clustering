They are at Maine Coast Memorial Hospital in Ellsworth and Lincoln County Health Care in Boothbay Harbor.\n\nAt the same time, Schnur noted, 18 hospitals across Maine run continuing care facilities for patients that provide extended care outside their hospital facilities.\n\nMaine General Health at Augusta\u2019s Gray Birch facility, for instance, provides long-term nursing care for individuals who require a longer stay in the facility and who need extensive help with their activities of daily life. There also are such facilities that provide Alzheimer\u2019s care, rehabilitation care and skilled nursing care.\n\nMoakler said that closing the facility, when administrators and the board looked at the financials, was a \u201cno brainer.\u201d\n\nThe unit was licensed for 26 patients and when the hospital was at its busiest was usually full, but in 2013 was down to an average of 17 patients, he said.\n\n\u201cWe looked at our finances and saw that long-term care was a pretty significant financial drain on the hospital,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when the hospital was in its heyday, the other side of the hospital was making up for it. But that could not happen when there was a $3 million loss.\u201d\n\nMoakler said the spike in uncompensated care was particularly hard-hitting, as the CEO said he could recall years not long ago when that figure was \u201cone million.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur plan to turn it around was to bring our outpatient rehab, which was located at a physical location outside the hospital, back inside the hospital,\u201d he said.\n\nAt the same time, the hospital transferred the rights to its nursing home beds to Madigan Estates, an 86-bed skilled and long-term care facility, which expanded to take on new patients.\n\nUsing early retirement and transferring nurses to other positions within the hospital, none of the 15 nurses on long-term care lost their jobs.\n\nMoakler said that the hospital also trimmed down its administrative staff from seven positions to four.\n\nHe also is proud of a move that he said he and other independent hospitals around the state have made. Moakler said Houlton Regional Hospital has joined forces with Cary Medical Center in Caribou, St. Joseph\u2019s Hospital in Bangor, Northern Maine General in Fort Kent and Mount Desert Island Hospital in Bar Harbor to form the Maine Rural Health Collaborative. They share efficiencies and best practices while working to preserve and offer the best care to patients.\n\nAt this point, Moakler estimated, Houlton Regional Hospital is about two years away from recovery.\n\n\u201cWe are on the right road,\u201d he said. \u201cThis fiscal year, we are still budgeting about a $200,000 loss,\u201d Moakler said. \u201cBut it is nowhere near where we were back in 2013, facing a $3 million loss. Now, we can see light at the end of the tunnel. We are not where we need to be yet, and we are still digging out of that hole, but we are getting better.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "HOULTON, Maine \u2014 Back in 2013, Houlton Regional Hospital administrators and the board of directors felt like financially a \u201ctrain was hurtling at them, full speed down the track,\u201d hospital CEO Tom Moakler said Friday.
