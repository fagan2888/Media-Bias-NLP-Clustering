Better health results in better costs,\u201d said Hibbard, co-author of \u201cPatient Activation and 30-Day Post-Discharge Hospital Utilization,\u201d a Journal of General Internal Medicine article that found an association between engaged patients and improved outcomes and lower service rates.\n\nAccording to Jennifer Sweeney, vice president at the National Partnership for Women and Families, true patient engagement not only serves as the most successful strategy for ensuring the delivery of patient- and family-centered care, it bolsters the ability of accountable care organizations (ACOs) to meet quality and savings goals.\n\nIf you give clinicians the right tools, you\u2019ll see less provider burnout and dissatisfaction.\n\nPartnering with patients and families to establish priorities and develop care plans lowers cost of care and readmission rates, while improving patient experience scores, which are tied to hospital reimbursement. Engagement also optimizes hospital resources, resulting in lower staff turnover, malpractice rates and rework, she said.\n\n\u201cUnderstanding patient and family needs, values and preferences is critical to designing care and implementing changes that improve outcomes and the experience of care and reduce costs,\u201d Sweeney said. \u201cWorking with patients and families supports the direction of resources toward strategies likely to improve outcomes and away from duplicative, low-value or harmful activities.\u201d\n\n[Also: Patient engagement and revenue cycle]\n\nShe said patient and family engagement is a partnership, and it's just as important to know what it is not. It's not about creating financial incentives to steer patient choices, convince them to adopt healthy behaviors or to manage their chronic conditions, she said.\n\nLike Healthcare Finance on Facebook\n\n\u201cPatient and family engagement is collaborative,\u201d Sweeney said. \u201cThey\u2019re equal partners in defining, designing and assessing care practices and the systems that serve them. They partner with stakeholders at all levels of the healthcare system\u2014from policy to governance.\u201d She advises hospital chief financial officers to \u201cframe partnerships with patients and families as a strategy for achieving overall ACO goals and partner with leaders to develop metrics to track the impact of these partnerships. Designate a leader, accountable for developing meaningful partnerships at all levels in the ACO.\u201d\n\nA good patient engagement strategy can have a positive impact on financial competitiveness, Hibbard said. \u201cIf you give clinicians the right tools, you\u2019ll see less provider burnout and dissatisfaction,\u201d she said.\n\nWorking with patients and families supports the direction of resources toward strategies likely to improve outcomes.\n\nHibbard, who developed the Patient Activation Measure, a self-assessment tool that monitors knowledge, skills and confidence in health management, said patient behavior is important to determining outcomes. \u201cIf they\u2019re not up to it, how do we get them to become up to it?\u201d she asked.\n\nAccording to a 2015 Health Affairs article Hibbard co-authored, higher levels of patient activation can be associated with better health outcomes, including better clinical indicators, healthy behaviors and preventive screening, and might even help achieve the key goals of health reform.\n\nTwitter: @HFNewsTweet", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/how-engage-patients-and-reduce-aco-costs", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/children-with-mother-in-hospital-room-flickr-feature.gif", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Patient engagement can ensure the delivery of patient- and family-centered care while bolstering the ability of accountable care organizations to meet quality and savings goals.", "title": "How to engage patients and reduce ACO costs"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HC_Finance", "image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/children-with-mother-in-hospital-room-flickr-feature.gif"}, "description": "Patient engagement can ensure the delivery of patient- and family-centered care while bolstering the ability of accountable care organizations to meet quality and savings goals.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "How to engage patients and reduce ACO costs"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "A 2014 report by the Brookings Institution called patient engagement the \u201ckey to improved health outcomes and lower costs.\u201d It claimed well-designed patient engagement strategies could \u201cimprove patient experience by allowing individuals to become active participants in their care.\u201d", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThere\u2019s a ton of research that active, engaged patients result in better health outcomes.\nWorking with patients and families supports the direction of resources toward strategies likely to improve outcomes.\n\u201cUnderstanding patient and family needs, values and preferences is critical to designing care and implementing changes that improve outcomes and the experience of care and reduce costs,\u201d Sweeney said.\nDesignate a leader, accountable for developing meaningful partnerships at all levels in the ACO.\u201dA good patient engagement strategy can have a positive impact on financial competitiveness, Hibbard said.\nBetter health results in better costs,\u201d said Hibbard, co-author of \u201cPatient Activation and 30-Day Post-Discharge Hospital Utilization,\u201d a Journal of General Internal Medicine article that found an association between engaged patients and improved outcomes and lower service rates."}
