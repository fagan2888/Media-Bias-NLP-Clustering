First, Happy New Year to you all! I am finally getting around to posting my C-SPAN Book TV interview about The End of Doom: Environmental Renewal in the Twenty-first Century below. The book has been described as "one of the year's best science books" and as the anti-doomsaying book of this decade.

From The End of Doom:

THE END OF THE WORLD IS NOT NIGH. Far from it. Humanity does face big environmental challenges over the course of the coming century, but the bulk of the scientific and economic evidence shows that most of the trends are positive or can be turned in a positive direction by further enhancing human ingenuity.... New technologies and wealth produced by human creativity will spark a vast environmental renewal in this century. Most global trends suggest that by the end of this century, the world will be populated with fewer and much wealthier people living mostly in cities fueled by cheap no-carbon energy sources. As the amount of land and sea needed to supply human needs decreases, both cities and wild nature will expand, with nature occupying or reoccupying the bulk of the land and sea freed up by human ingenuity. Nature will become chiefly an arena for human pleasure and instruction, not a source of raw materials. I donâ€™t fear for future generations; instead, I rejoice for them.
