Plus: Should Mitt Romney grow a beard?\n\nRepublicans have announced their new leadership lineup, and its makeup is very much like the old one \u2014 lacking women.\n\nOnly one of the House of Representatives committees in the next Congress will be headed by a chairwoman rather than a chairman.\n\nCommittee leaders tend to have greater influence and fund-raising power within their party, and of the 19 standing committees and the two select committees, 20 will be led by men and one by a woman.\n\nCandice S. Miller of Michigan will remain the chairwoman of the Administration Committee. (It\u2019s something like the chamber\u2019s general manager and accountant, and it oversees the Library of Congress, the Smithsonian and the National Zoo.)\n\nThe issue has come up before. Former Speaker Newt Gingrich made a high-profile plea for more diversity in 2012 in an interview with Jay Leno on the \u201cTonight\u201d show. Mr. Gingrich called it a \u201creal problem for the Republican Party.\u201d\n\n\u201cOutreach is when five white guys have a meeting and call you,\u201d he said. \u201cInclusion is if you\u2019re in the meeting.\u201d\n\nWomen fare better in the party\u2019s House leadership, where three of the eight members are women. One of them, Representative Virginia Foxx of North Carolina, told The National Journal in October that the lack of chairwomen was because \u201cwomen came in and they haven\u2019t stayed in as long as the men have.\u201d\n\nHaving just won the Senate majority, Republicans may not name their committee leaders until January, after the Louisiana race is settled. In the current Democratic-controlled Senate, 6 of the 16 standing committees are led by women, and women run both the Select Committee on Intelligence and the Select Committee on Ethics.\n\n\u2014 Steve Kenny\n\nNewt Gingrich loves being in front of a camera. That was no less true 20 years ago, when he was speaker of the House, than it is now.\n\nBack then, his rather colorful performances turned a decades-long tradition of low-key daily press briefings into free-swinging televised theater that often veered far from the Republicans\u2019 message of the day.\n\nThat made the generation of Republican leaders that followed him a little wary. Representative Eric Cantor did away with such briefings altogether when he was majority leader.\n\nNow, Representative Kevin McCarthy, the Republican from California who is the current leader, wants to bring them back in the more traditional low-key, pen-and-pad way. With no cameras.\n\nIt\u2019s a quaint notion in the digital era. Let\u2019s see how long it lasts.\n\n\u2014 Carl Hulse\n\nMitch McConnell has promised that Republicans will run a more open Senate after being stifled by Democrats for years. There will be spirited debate, he said, and lawmakers from both parties will be given a fair chance to shape legislation.\n\nBut it was Mr. McConnell who was doing the stifling yesterday as a proposed overhaul of the National Security Agency\u2019s mass surveillance program died in the lame-duck session. It was an abrupt case of role reversal.\n\nSome Republicans supported the bipartisan legislation, but Mr. McConnell rallied the opposition, arguing that any curbs on the N.S.A. program would represent a threat to national security.\n\nDemocrats pounced, saying that Mr. McConnell, at the first opportunity, passed up an invitation to engage in exactly the kind of floor fight he said he would relish. They suggested it didn\u2019t bode well for next year.\n\nMcConnell aides dismissed the objections, noting that the bill was not reviewed by the Judiciary Committee and that Democrats were trying to jam it through over the course of a few crowded days.\n\nStill, Mr. McConnell has made extensive commitments on how he intends to operate the Senate as majority leader, and his ability to fulfill them will be followed closely.\n\n\u2014 Carl Hulse\n\nIt\u2019s been a bumpy week for Bill de Blasio. But a little dose of Washington might help.\n\nThe New York City mayor is in the capital today to bask in the company of his fellow progressives, stopping by the White House to chat with Valerie Jarrett before attending a confab with liberal A-listers like Juli\u00e1n Castro, the housing secretary, and Senator Elizabeth Warren.\n\nThe visit is another sign that Mr. de Blasio, 11 months into his first term, is intent on burnishing his national profile. But it could also serve as a much-needed respite for the mayor, who is coping with the departure of a key aide with messy personal troubles and a new poll showing a stark divide in his approval rating between whites and blacks.\n\nDe Blasio watchers will be wondering if the perennially tardy mayor \u2014 who cited a \u201cvery rough night\u201d after missing a memorial service last week with grieving relatives of plane crash victims \u2014 arrives in Washington in time for his first stop, an 8:30 breakfast interview with Mike Allen of Politico.\n\nBut there is zero chance the mayor will be late for a news conference \u2014 because he isn\u2019t having one. Mr. de Blasio will return to New York on Wednesday night without taking questions from reporters.\n\n\u2014 Michael M. Grynbaum\n\nPresident Obama speaks at a digital learning conference and then signs the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 2014 into law. He is also expected to scrap strict safety regulations for federally subsidized child-care facilities.\n\nVice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. begins his five-day trip to Morocco, Ukraine and Turkey with a meeting with King Mohammed VI of Morocco. They are expected to discuss the conflicts in Iraq and Syria.\n\nJoseph P. Clancy, the acting director of the Secret Service, faces questions about the agency\u2019s recent stumbles at a 10 a.m. House Judiciary Committee hearing.\n\nThe House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform investigates data security at the Postal Service at a 10:30 a.m. hearing.\n\nAs potential presidential candidates use the holidays to contemplate their futures, they will seek advice from friends, family and those who have been there before them.\n\nSome are likely to pick the brain of Mitt Romney, who has twice run for president.\n\nMr. Romney, speaking at Brigham Young University on Tuesday, shared some of the lessons he has learned: Shorten anecdotes, don\u2019t speak so fast and stick with the best applause lines.\n\nHe said he heard a different take from voters: Shed the image of a conservative corporate consultant and, well, bring sexy back.\n\n\u201cI was told to take bigger steps when I walk, to show that I\u2019m young and athletic,\u201d said Mr. Romney, who is now 67. \u201cAnother said I should stop shaving for a few days.\u201d\n\nStill, he is a devout Mormon \u2013 a religion that currently frowns on beards (but hasn\u2019t always) \u2013 and he has hung on to his razor, and his blazer.\n\nScruff may be in, but we\u2019ve always thought of Mr. Romney as more Tabernacle than trendy.\n\n\u2014 Alan Rappeport\n\nJeb Bush speaks at a Washington education conference tomorrow, and some on Capitol Hill are calling it \u201cthe unofficial beginning of the 2016 election cycle,\u201d The Wall Street Journal says.\n\nRepresentative Nancy Pelosi has angered many Democrats by refusing to let Representative Tammy Duckworth of Illinois vote by proxy, according to The Hill. Ms. Duckworth, a veteran who lost both legs in Iraq, is pregnant, and her doctor has forbidden her to travel to Washington.\n\nThe tension between President Obama and his generals over Iraq recalls the discussions of Vietnam in the early days of the Kennedy administration, Fredrik Logevall and Gordon M. Goldstein write in Politico Magazine.\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton is using Twitter to urge former President George W. Bush to open a Twitter account, The Los Angeles Times says.\n\nGov. Steve Bullock of Montana is again trying to expand Medicaid to cover an additional 70,000 residents of his state as part of the Affordable Care Act, The Helena Independent Record reports. The Legislature rejected the move last year.", "article_metadata": {"adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/first-draft/2014/11/19", "PT": "Blogs", "BN": "first-draft", "CG": "Politics", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us/politics/firstdraft", "twitter": {"description": "Political News, Now.", "title": "First Draft", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2014/11/19/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/nytdesign/2014/politics/logo-flag-150.png", "site": "@NYTPolitics", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "sourceApp": "blogs", "live_stream_endpoint": "http://static01.nyt.com/live-coverage/first-draft/live-stream-endpoint-11192014.jsonp", "keywords": "politics, congress, midterms, elections, 2014, 2016, house, senate, advertising, political advertising, campaign finance, senator, Obama, Boehner, Clinton, Hillary, Hillary Clinton, Reid, McConnell, Christie, Paul, Washington, capitol", "ad_sensitivity": "noxxl", "article": {"section": "Politics"}, "nyt_active_day": 0, "SCG": "First Draft", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf2c2\"", "article_summary": "The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform investigates data security at the Postal Service at a 10:30 a.m. hearing.\nSome Republicans supported the bipartisan legislation, but Mr. McConnell rallied the opposition, arguing that any curbs on the N.S.A.\nScruff may be in, but we\u2019ve always thought of Mr. Romney as more Tabernacle than trendy.\n\u201cI was told to take bigger steps when I walk, to show that I\u2019m young and athletic,\u201d said Mr. Romney, who is now 67.\nDemocrats pounced, saying that Mr. McConnell, at the first opportunity, passed up an invitation to engage in exactly the kind of floor fight he said he would relish."}
