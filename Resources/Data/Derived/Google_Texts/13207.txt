EMILY’s List, a political group that promotes female Democratic candidates who support abortion rights, has pulled in a record-breaking fundraising haul of $10.5 million over the past six months.

That’s more money than the group has ever raised during the first six months of a year without a major election cycle.

“The EMILY’s List community has spoken loud and clear — 2016 will be an historic year for women candidates up and down the ballot and across the country,” EMILY’s List President Stephanie Schriock said in a statement.

“We’re seeing a huge show of strength from our more than 3 million members this year, and they’re building tremendous momentum to elect more women who are on the right side of the issues that matter to women and families. And with Republicans advancing their extreme, anti-woman agenda, never has it been more important to elect more pro-choice Democratic women at all levels.”

The statement adds that the group raised money from 60,000 donors, with an average donation of $160.

Much of the group’s enthusiasm is centered on Hillary Clinton Hillary Rodham ClintonTrump aide: 'Hillary is the one who’s got a gender gap' WaPo editorial board: 'No excuse' for Clinton email practices Overnight Finance: Puerto Rico bill clears panel | IRS chief vows to finish term | Bill would require nominees to release tax returns MORE’s bid to be the first female president. The group endorsed her bid for the Democratic nomination early on and has repeatedly pitched its fundraising list with emails about Clinton and other female congressional candidates, including Reps. Donna Edwards (Md.) and Tammy Duckworth (Ill.).

The group’s name is an acronym for the saying “Early Money Is Like Yeast (it makes the dough rise).”
