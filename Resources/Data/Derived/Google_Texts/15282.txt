Lawmakers aren't the only ones fed up with the political stalemate over Medicaid expansion in Virginia's General Assembly. It's caught the attention of a Charlottesville-area physician.

Dr. Greg Gelburd says he will fast in Richmond in protest until the General Assembly approves Medicaid expansion. He's doing it on behalf of his patients who lack health coverage, and would benefit directly from expansion under the Affordable Care Act.

“I'm really just taking it day by day. I honestly do not know my physical condition or what's going to happen with the assembly. If the assembly votes today or tomorrow, great, I go home. If not, I'll be here for a while,” said Gelburd.

Gelburd says he has never participated in a protest like this, but feels it is his duty to represent the voice of the working poor in the Charlottesville community.
