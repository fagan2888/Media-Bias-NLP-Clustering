It's experience. We're getting a better grasp of what the population is like,\" said Michael Eiselstein, director of insured products and exchanges.\n\nDuring the course of open enrollment, which ran from Nov. 1 to Jan. 31, federal officials with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said they were seeing more of the coveted \"young invincibles\" \u2014 people ages 18 to 34 \u2014 sign up. Younger members are generally healthier and less expensive to cover so insurers had hoped to see more in their membership pools.\n\nFor BCBST, however, the percentage is right around the 2015 number: 26 percent.\n\nFifty-one percent of enrollees are 45 or older.\n\nThe average age is 42.\n\nMore than half, 53 percent, are female.\n\nA similar mix of members mean the insurer is facing another year of losses, despite an average rate increase of 36.3 percent for 2016. The individual exchange has hit BCBST's bottom line. It's lost about $300 million in two years.\n\nBlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee (Photo: Logo)\n\n\"We expect to be in a loss position in 2016 as well,\" said Roy Vaughn, vice president of corporate communications.\n\nAlthough it's still in the process of reviewing data to determine what's needed in rates for 2017, Vaughn expects it to be \"on the order of magnitude\" of 2016.\n\nThe not-for-profit insurer is \"committed to trying to make it work\" but its products or geographic areas of coverage may have to change as it tries to set rates that cover medical costs, Vaughn said.\n\n\"I don't want to characterize this as we're stepping back \u2014 we're not. At the same time we have to take a pragmatic view. If we can't achieve a sustainable model then we can't offer this coverage to anyone,\" said Vaughn.\n\nInsurance Commissioner Julie Mix McPeak indicated early in the legislative session she expects rate requests to come in on par with those requested in 2016.\n\nTennessee has had among the lowest premium costs on the exchange despite having one of the costliest, highest risk members.\n\nBCBST received the second highest average increase from the Tennessee Department of Commerce and Insurance for 2016. Community Health Alliance received the highest average increase but entered into voluntary run-off in October and is no longer offering plans. The four insurers offered premiums in the same range, unlike the first two years when there was one carrier with the cheapest plan.\n\nAs rates go up so, too, do the federal subsidies. Many don't feel the full effect of a rate increase. Last year 83 percent of BCBST enrollees received a tax credit. This year it's 87 percent.\n\nThe number of enrollees will drop in the coming months. Some people select more than one plan and later decide which to drop while some just don't pay the first premium at all. Still, others may move into Medicaid, Medicare or a group plan.\n\nEiselstein estimates they lose about 3 percent a month, a similar number to attrition on the individual market before the ACA. BCBST had 164,000 enrollees after 2015 open enrollment ended but was covering about 143,000 by Nov. 1.\n\nOverall this was the smoothest enrollment in terms of working with federal officials and technology, Eiselstein said.\n\nThe insurer is trying to educate its enrollees on what their benefits are, such as understanding the network.\n\n\"We believe this market has a long term potential for us. We know we've got to get it to a sustainable model,\" said Vaughn. \"We're working hard to do that.\"\n\nReach Holly Fletcher at 615-259-8287 or on Twitter @hollyfletcher.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://tnne.ws/1oSqTGK", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "In total,\u00a0166,425 people selected BCBST plans during open enrollment;\u00a0across the state, 268,867 selected plans from all four carriers.", "og": {"site_name": "The Tennessean", "description": "In total,\u00a0166,425 people selected BCBST plans during open enrollment;\u00a0across the state, 268,867 selected plans from all four carriers.", "title": "ObamaCare enrollment mix signals 2016 losses for BCBST", "url": "http://www.tennessean.com/story/money/industries/health-care/2016/03/03/affordable-care-act-figures-signal-2016-loses-bcbst/81264682/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/tennessean.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In total,\u00a0166,425 people selected BCBST plans during open enrollment;\u00a0across the state, 268,867 selected plans from all four carriers.", "title": "ObamaCare enrollment mix signals 2016 losses for BCBST", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a70f6785c9e20a59a39c8440068dc09d92f36fc1/c=0-14-549-563&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/01/21/Nashville/Nashville/635889911802180737-Infographic-1-.png", "creator": "@tennessean", "site": "@tennessean", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600028886", "fb": {"app_id": 121487414583460}, "viewport": "width=1070", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/byhollyfletcher"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Subjects/Affordable Care Act", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Subjects/Affordable Care Act", "title": "ObamaCare enrollment mix signals 2016 losses for BCBST", "author": "Holly Fletcher", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "money/industries/health-care", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/80c8c777b173d432c4c6668796df0c48082b5edb/c=12-0-538-701/local/-/media/2016/01/21/Nashville/Nashville/635889911802180737-Infographic-1-.png", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ffed8781a1702c4f56424a1980e33f3cd09e131b/c=0-14-549-563/local/-/media/2016/01/21/Nashville/Nashville/635889911802180737-Infographic-1-.png", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2aaf60ad0f42af4abc11e246c3e514919aa7ffbb/c=0-17-549-430/local/-/media/2016/01/21/Nashville/Nashville/635889911802180737-Infographic-1-.png", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/463ad43891c74dc0d98dc74a124e1d50bca1b313/c=0-14-549-324&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2016/01/21/Nashville/Nashville/635889911802180737-Infographic-1-.png", "publishtime": "2016-03-03T12:49:35.533000-06:00", "shorthed": "Obamacare signups signal losses for BCBST", "articleid": 81264682, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/91dcd890800e79eb690ca476850101855d167ad5/c=0-14-549-324/local/-/media/2016/01/21/Nashville/Nashville/635889911802180737-Infographic-1-.png", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/df22b0767bdf121f6031893617d98f3b729e3bfd/c=63-0-456-701/local/-/media/2016/01/21/Nashville/Nashville/635889911802180737-Infographic-1-.png"}}, "news_keywords": "aca, bcbst, bluecross blueshield of tennessee, obamacare, affordable care act, insurance in tennessee,"}, "article_summary": "In total, 166,425 people selected BCBST plans during open enrollment; across the state, 268,867 selected plans from all four carriers.\nBCBST received the second highest average increase from the Tennessee Department of Commerce and Insurance for 2016.\nLast year 83 percent of BCBST enrollees received a tax credit.\nA similar mix of members mean the insurer is facing another year of losses, despite an average rate increase of 36.3 percent for 2016.\nCommunity Health Alliance received the highest average increase but entered into voluntary run-off in October and is no longer offering plans."}
