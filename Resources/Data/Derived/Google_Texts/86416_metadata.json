Being right is such a drag.\n\nThe law hasn\u2019t even come into effect yet and legal proceedings have already begun against a Saudi writer who spread \u201cinsults and hate speech against the UAE.\u201d That according to Dubai\u2019s head of general security Dhaki Khalfan, who launched the criminal complaint on Monday.\n\nThe writer in question, Mohammed Al Hadif, has more than 500,000 followers on Twitter. In recent months, he\u2019s used the social media platform to voice criticism of the UAE\u2019s role in Yemen and its relations with Iran.\n\nThe new anti-hate law makes it illegal to discriminate against individuals or groups on the basis of religion, caste, doctrine, race, colour or ethnic origin. Government criticism is not a punishable offence here. Perhaps Khalfan will argue that Al Hadif discriminated against all Emiratis \u2014 a nationality not an ethnicity, but meh, close enough \u2014 when he criticized the government on Twitter. Whatever the tactic, Khalfan will be wrong.\n\nLast week I argued that anti-discrimination laws \u201cshould protect people \u2014 people who hold ideas and beliefs \u2014 but not the ideas and beliefs themselves.\u201d I was talking about religions and the new law\u2019s thinly veiled blasphemy provisions, but the same logic applies to governments and nations.\n\nPunishing people for criticizing or insulting religions or governments violates our internationally protected right to freedom of expression. It also sets a terrible precedent, especially in a country that relies so heavily on tourism and foreign investment.\n\nBy Khalfan\u2019s logic, I should be arrested for writing this article. Beachgoers should be jailed for saying the sand is too hot. Architects should be fined for saying the Burj Khalifa is ugly. Because we\u2019ve all insulted the UAE.\n\nEmirati leaders and authorities are usually more strategic about deploying oppressive and illiberal laws, waiting a bit to enforce them and then only doing so sporadically to remind people of their existence. If laws prohibiting immodest dress, public displays of affection and eating during Ramadan were consistently enforced, most of the country\u2019s residents would be drowning in fines or languishing in jail.\n\nThe UAE\u2019s new anti-discrimination law, like so many laws in the country, is a wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing. The only surprise is how quickly this wolf has shown its fangs.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Beliefs, Ethics, Institutions, Opinion, Abu Dhabi, blasphemy, Christian, Dhaki Khalfan, Dubai, free speech", "generator": "Easy Digital Downloads v2.5.16", "og": {"site_name": "Religion News Service", "description": "Last week\u2019s royal decree, which leaders touted as a shield against religious hatred and discrimination, is already being used as a sword to suppress government critics.", "title": "Told ya so!
