PopHealthMan and Affinity Health Plan of New York announced today that they have expanded their long-term relationship with a contract for PopHealthMan to provide Health Insurance Exchange analytics and risk adjustment support services for Affinity’s Qualified Health Plan (QHP) population.

PopHealthMan will support Affinity in its mission to provide to its QHP members access to quality, cost effective care, helping those members maintain a better quality of life. As part of this arrangement, PopHealthMan will provide leading edge data analysis services combined with targeted retrospective data collection and prospective analytics services to obtain a comprehensive view of the health status and health challenges facing Affinity’s QHP members. Additionally, PopHealthMan will support Affinity in meeting the Health Insurance Exchange Edge Server requirements that will be used by the Exchange to perform risk adjustment among the plans participating on the exchange. Through utilizing PopHealthMan’s services, Affinity is able to better understand and meet the needs of its QHP membership with chronic and acute illnesses. Accurate, complete, timely and well-documented diagnoses are key inputs to achieving superior health outcomes and keeping healthcare affordable for Affinity’s QHP members.

“Affinity has a long standing mission of helping the underserved in New York. Given our long-term relationship with PopHealthMan with our Medicare population, expanding our partnership was a logical business decision as we extend our services to those in our QHP business,” said Susan Tseng, Affinity’s Executive Director of Health Insurance Exchange. “Our partnership with PopHealthMan will be an important element of our success in managing the health of the QHP population while keeping premiums as affordable as possible.”

“PopHealthMan is very pleased to be able to extend our expertise in the Health Insurance Exchange market with Affinity Health Plan” added Deb Hecker, CEO of PopHealthMan.

We offer the critical services but take a flexible approach to working with health plans to provide targeted solutions to meet the specific needs of each plan.”
