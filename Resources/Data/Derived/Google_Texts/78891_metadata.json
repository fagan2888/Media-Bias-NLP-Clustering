He is perfectly cast as Fabrizio, a 20-year-old Italian overcome by first love. The young actor posses a magnetic energy and a tenor to make young girls like Clara, the object of Fabrizio\u2019s affections, swoon.\n\n\u2018The Light in the Piazza\u2019 Where: Front Porch Theatricals at the New Hazlett Theater, North Side. When: Through Aug. 30; 8 p.m. Thursday-Saturday and 2 p.m. Sunday; also Aug. 29 at 2 p.m. Tickets: $24-$30; frontporchpgh.com, showclix.com or 1-888-718-4253.\n\nIt is oh-so romantico when Fabrizio\u2019s attentions throw into turmoil the lives of a vacationing mother and daughter in 1963 Florence. Sparks fly when he spots the delicate Clara -- redheaded soprano Lindsay Bayer, a New York-based Pittsburgher -- and she is equally smitten. But we are in on a secret that Fabrizio does not know, and the potential for a tragico ending also is in the soapy air.\n\nKeeping constant watch over her daughter Clara and letting the audience in on her innermost feelings is Margaret, a strong Southern woman with a sharp tongue and the air of one who has seen it all, and then some.\n\nBecki Toth, an educator and director when she\u2019s not onstage, is as adept at humor and eliciting compassion as she is projecting Adam Guettel\u2019s most stirring songs.\n\nThis is Ms. Toth\u2019s second show for Front Porch Theatricals and a happy reunion with Ms. Bayer and producer Leon Zionts, who all were in Stage 62\u2019s \u201cSweeney Todd.\u201d Despite the heat projected by the young would-be lovers, Ms. Toth\u2019s Margaret is the beating heart of \u201cLight in the Piazza,\u201d a role that won a best actress Tony Award for Victoria Clark.\n\nMargaret\u2019s at first withering looks at Fabrizio and then his father (the invaluable Jeff Howell), both of whom she suspects of being lotharios, are priceless. It\u2019s no wonder Mr. Grosso\u2019s Fabrizio so convincingly shrinks away when under her gaze. Margaret is fiercely protective of Clara and her secret -- the girl has been rendered childlike by a head injury suffered when she was 12.\n\nMargaret, whose husband has stayed behind to tend to his business, has big decisions to make when Fabrizio asks Clara to marry him. Should her daughter, now 26, be allowed to break out of the safety cocoon set up long ago by her parents? Is the possibility of love worth all the risks of letting go?\n\nUnder the direction of Stephen Santa, an expressive cast plays up the much appreciated humor to be found in Craig Lucas\u2019 book, based on the 1962 movie drama. The lighter moments are usually the result of language barriers, and Mr. Santa and music director Carmen Villalpando Rolla have gathered cast members who are convincing as Italians for whom English is a struggle.\n\nOpera singer Antonia Botti-Lodovico as Fabrizio\u2019s discontented sister-in-law, married to the cheating Giuseppe (Patrick Cannon), has the acting down but her unrestrained soprano doesn\u2019t quite fit with the rest of the adept Broadway voices, who are in tune with the music\u2019s emotional and classical range.\n\nThese are not songs that will find their way onto the pop charts nor are they giddy with the vulgarity of some recent Broadway successes. Instead, a band with a piano, cello, bass, violin and harp performs a marathon of complex and lovely melodies while the performers infuse emotion into sometimes unwieldy prose.\n\nAnd unless you know Italian, you don\u2019t always know what Fabrizio is saying or singing, but emotion and intention shine through.\n\nYou might say there is no dancing in \u201cThe Light in the Piazza,\u201d but movement is the key to the success of choreography by Nathan Hart and Bryce Cutler\u2019s spare production. Empty frames representing the glories of Italian art hang on the edges of the thrust stage and other, movable, door-sized frames are made mobile props, placed with grace and purpose by an ensemble quartet.\n\nThe lush Broadway production of the Lucas-Guettel musical was nominated for 11 Tony Awards and won six. Front Porch\u2019s pared-down production sheds light on the humor and drama and hints at the passion made possible by falling in love with Florence and Rome as the backdrop.\n\n\u201cThe Light in the Piazza\u201d is the second musical of the summer for Front Porch, the first time the company has done two since it began in 2009 with \u201cOnly Me.\u201d Before the opening night performance Friday, co-producers Leon and Nancy Zionts and Bruce Smith promised two more next summer.\n\nWith \u201cIn the Heights\u201d and \u201cParade\u201d in recent years, Front Porch\u2019s aim has been increasingly ambitious and now, with the passions at play in \u201cThe Light in the Piazza,\u201d the company has added more heat to the dog days of summer.\n\nSharon Eberson: seberson@post-gazette.com or 412-263-1960.
