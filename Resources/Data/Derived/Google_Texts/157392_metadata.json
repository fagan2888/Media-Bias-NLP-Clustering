Now, her parents plan to take legal action.\n\nThe funeral of a baby girl whose head and spine were crushed after being birthed with forceps was held on Saturday. Now, her parents plan to take legal action. HellN, CC BY 2.0\n\nThere are so many things that can go wrong during a baby\u2019s birth, but for Rachel Melancon and her fianc\u00e9 Allen Coats of southeast Texas, perhaps one of the most gruesome outcomes occurred during the birth of their baby girl Olivia Marie on Dec. 28: Their obstetrician cracked Olivia\u2019s skull with forceps, causing her death five days later. The family of Olivia Marie held a funeral for her over the weekend, and now they plan to take action.\n\nBoth Coats and Melancon say that they plan to sue their obstetrician, Dr. George T. Backardjiev, after he refused to perform a C-section on Melancon, despite her requests on the basis that her body was small \u2014 she is 4-foot-11 \u2014 and Olivia was relatively large, at 7 lbs., 14.9 ounces. But even after 18 hours of labor, the doctor still wouldn\u2019t perform the operation. When he noticed that the baby was facing the wrong way, and wasn\u2019t able to turn her around manually, he used forceps, the NY Daily News reports.\n\n\u201cHe took the small forceps to try to pull the baby out,\u201d The baby\u2019s grandmother, Angie Coats, told ABC News. \u201cHe kept going and even put his foot up on the bed trying to pull. He was turning and twisting and she would never come out. He put the forceps on way and the other. When he touched the top and side of the skill, we heard a pop, like clay cracking in pottery, and heard her skull crush.\u201d\n\nMelancon was subsequently sent in for an emergency C-section, however, it was too late, because upon delivery, Olivia \u201cwas not breathing and she never cried,\u201d Coats told ABC. Still, Olivia was sent from The Medical Center at Southeast Texas, where she was birthed, to Houston\u2019s Children\u2019s Memorial Hermann Hospital. At the Children\u2019s Hospital, doctors told the family upon arrival that the baby was in need of life support after suffering \u201cnumerous skull fractures.\u201d Five days later, she died.\n\nThe family held a funeral for Olivia Marie on Saturday, and held a balloon release in her honor, calling it \u201cthe most beautiful thing ever,\u201d on a Facebook page devoted to her. \u201cWe are so so so so happy with the turnout of the funeral,\u201d they wrote in a post. \u201cSo many people came and donated and gave us support. We are standing here at peace because [of] all of you! Ya\u2019ll are truly carrying our pain in y\u2019all\u2019s heart.\u201d\n\nBoth parents plan to sue Dr. Backardjiev for sole responsibility in the incident, saying that the hospital and its nurses were \u201cgreat.\u201d \u201cThis is not their fault,\u201d Angie Coats told ABC. \u201cIt\u2019s one man\u2019s fault.\u201d The CEO of The Medical Center of Southeast Texas, Matt Roberts, also said in a statement that the hospital had launched an investigation into the case. \u201cOur independent medical staff leadership shares in the hospital\u2019s commitment to take all necessary actions to understand why this happened,\u201d the statement said, according to ABC.\n\nThe family is also using the Facebook page to campaign against the use of forceps in all births \u2014 on the basis that there are other methods for birthing a baby, such as \u201cvacs and C-sections in this millennium.\u201d Their petition has already gotten over 33,000 signatures.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "funeral, baby, forceps, olivia marie, texas, skull, crushed, c-section, pregnancy", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The funeral of a baby girl whose head and spine were crushed after being birthed with forceps was held on Saturday.
