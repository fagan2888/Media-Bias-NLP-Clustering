No weapons were found when officers looked through his car, which was parked on campus.\n\nHowever, police say Raftery appeared to be drunk.\n\nRaferty was served with misdemeanor charges of trespassing and interfering with staff and students of an educational facility. He had an existing warrant for traffic violations, and was arrested for that.\n\nThe district says at every step of his misadventure, the suspect should have been stopped. When he walked into the school, a security guard posted at the front doors should have stopped him. For some reason, the suspect was able to walk right past the security station.\n\nEven if he got into the school, he should have never made it into the classroom. Class was in session at 1:30 Friday afternoon, and all doors in the school except the front doors are locked during the school day. Yet somehow the man was able to get inside the classroom.\n\n\"If he got into a classroom that easily, he could have gotten into the office or anywhere, and it's a very scary situation to have your kids in that kind of situation,\" parent Jennifer Brown told 11 News.\n\nPolice and district officials will now be reviewing surveillance footage, which they hope will shed more light on how it happened. The district said they'll consider making changes to security policies after the investigation is complete.\n\nSchool resumed as normal after the incident.\n\nHere's the letter sent to parents:\n\nAt about 1:30 p.m., today, Jan. 16, an unknown male entered Pine Creek High School and proceeded to a classroom. He entered the classroom and sat down, did not talk to any students and did not threaten anyone. A student immediately notified security officers. When the man was approached by security officers, he appeared to be under the influence. He was detained by security officers and taken out of the building less than five minutes after he came in. Law enforcement officers were notified and it was discovered that the man had a warrant for his arrest.\n\nSecurity and law enforcement officers searched the suspect\u2019s car and performed a security sweep of the high school. Students proceeded through the rest of their scheduled classes this afternoon and all students and staff members are safe.\n\nPine Creek security officers will review security camera videos and are continuing their investigation into the incident.\n\nAcademy District 20 Chief of Security Brian Grady in addition to Colorado Springs Police are investigating today\u2019s incident in which an unknown male entered Pine Creek High School. After the investigation is concluded, the district will make any recommended changes in procedures to improved security measures.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A drunk man wanted on a warrant was able to walk inside a school, slip past security guards and sit in on a couple minutes of class before students spotted him and alerted authorities.", "language": "english", "author": "KKTV", "og": {"url": "http://www.kktv.com/home/headlines/Man-Walks-into-Local-School-Sits-Down-in-Classroom-288880631.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/PineCreekHS1.JPG", "type": "article", "description": "A drunk man wanted on a warrant was able to walk inside a school, slip past security guards and sit in on a couple minutes of class before students spotted him and alerted authorities.", "title": "Police: Intoxicated Man Slips Past Security, Sits In Classroom"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kktv.com", "description": "A drunk man wanted on a warrant was able to walk inside a school, slip past security guards and sit in on a couple minutes of class before students spotted him and alerted authorities.", "creator": "@kktv11news", "url": "http://www.kktv.com/home/headlines/Man-Walks-into-Local-School-Sits-Down-in-Classroom-288880631.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/PineCreekHS.JPG", "title": "Police: Intoxicated Man Slips Past Security, Sits In Classroom", "site": "@kktv11news", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "Police: Intoxicated Man Slips Past Security, Sits In Classroom", "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "gUw-UdhXT7u-BunNWfQWA_t3azu7BEGubOcNT6HddJQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Police Intoxicated Man Slips Past, Security"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1357\"", "article_summary": "Pine Creek security officers will review security camera videos and are continuing their investigation into the incident.\nHe was detained by security officers and taken out of the building less than five minutes after he came in.\nSecurity and law enforcement officers searched the suspect\u2019s car and performed a security sweep of the high school.\nWhen the man was approached by security officers, he appeared to be under the influence.\nHere's the letter sent to parents:At about 1:30 p.m., today, Jan. 16, an unknown male entered Pine Creek High School and proceeded to a classroom."}
