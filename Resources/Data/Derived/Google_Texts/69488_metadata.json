That should be enough to provide a hometown victory in front of another big, late-season crowd of 36,649 at Coors Field.\n\nIt should have been enough, but it wasn\u2019t.\n\nThe Giants got 14 hits to beat the Rockies 7-4, salvaging a split in the four-game series. The Rockies finished off what could have been a sweet homestand on a sour note, finishing the eight-game set 4-4.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to get a bundle against (Bumgarner)\u201d manager Walt Weiss said. \u201cI thought we competed well. We had a couple of innings \u2014 the first and the fifth \u2014 where we could potentially have a big inning there \u2014 but I thought we made him work.\u201d\n\nThe Rockies have underachieved in LoDo, going 31-40 thus far. They have one 10-game homestand left this season. They are on pace for a 95-loss season as they open a 10-game, West Coast road trip at San Diego Monday afternoon.\n\nColorado left-hander Yohan Flande, who\u2019s been a ray of light in an often gloomy season, was ineffective Sunday. The Giants ripped him for six runs on eight hits in 4 innings, his shortest start of the year.\n\nFlande got flamb\u00e9ed in the fifth when the Giants broke the game open by scoring five runs as seven consecutive batters reached base.\n\nGregor Blanco hit a one-out single, followed up by another single by Kelby Thompson and a two-run triple by Matt Duffy that sailed over the head of center fielder Brandon Barnes.\n\nFlande was done, but the Giants weren\u2019t. Marlon Byrd hit a run-scoring single off reliever Brooks Brown and Brandon Crawford drove a two-run double off reliever Rex Brothers into the right-center field gap.\n\nServing up home runs has been Flande\u2019s flaw this season, and it was again Sunday. Rockies killer Buster Posey hit a leadoff homer in the fourth, the seventh straight start in which Flande gave up a home run. The homer was Posey\u2019s 17th this season and the 100th of his career.\n\nColorado landed a lot of punches but could never knock out Bumgarner, who improved to 17-6. The Rockies loaded the bases in the first with back-to-back singles by Jose Reyes and Cristhian Adames and a walk by Nolan Arenado. An RBI grounder by Carlos Gonzalez and a sacrifice fly by Wilin Rosario staked Colorado to a 2-0 lead.\n\nThe Rockies scored two more off Bumgarner in the fifth, the big hit a two-run single by Adames. A possible big inning fizzled when Bumgarner got Arenado to ground into a double play.\n\nStreak stopper. Arenado was unable to continue his home-run magic. He went 0-for-3 with a walk, snapping his streak of six consecutive games with a home run \u2014 the longest run in Rockies history. His nine-game hitting streak also ended.\n\nIt was not a good omen when Arenado flew out to left in the first inning, breaking his bat.\n\n\u201cIt was just sad, because that was the bat I hit my homers with,\u201d he said.\n\nArenado insisted he was not thinking about the streak when he came to the plate.\n\n\u201cI knew about it, but I never thought about it for the whole time when I was hitting the homers \u2026 it didn\u2019t cross my mind,\u201d he said.\n\nBut he admitted that if he had gotten a chance to bat in the ninth inning Sunday, he would have been swinging for the fences.\n\n\u201cYeah, if there were men on base, I would have tired to drive the ball,\u201d he said.\n\nHundley hurt. Starting catcher Nick Hundley suffered a strained neck when he fouled off a pitch in the second inning. He stayed in the game through the fifth, but left because he was unable to turn his neck freely from side to side.\n\n\u201cIt just locked up on me, \u201d said Hundley, who does not have a history of neck issues. \u201cI got a lot of treatment, so hopefully that helps.\u201d\n\nHundley is officially listed as day to day and he will make the trip to San Diego.\n\nFootnotes. With their bullpen full because of September call-ups, Rockies used eight relievers Sunday, in part to give young pitchers a look against big-league competition. \u2026 Shortstop Jose Reyes went 2-for-4 and is hitting .343 since Aug. 18. \u2026 Posey batted 2-for-4, giving him a career average of .396 at Coors Field, the highest batting average among active players (minimum 120 plate appearances).\n\nPatrick Saunders: psaunders@denverpost.com or twitter.com/psaundersdp\n\nLooking ahead\n\nRockies\u2019 Kyle Kendrick (4-12, 6.29 ERA) at Padres\u2019 Ian Kennedy (8-12, 3.88), 2:10 p.m. Monday, ROOT; 850 AM\n\nKendrick is down to his final few starts in a Rockies uniform, as his one-year, $5.5 million contract nears its end. It\u2019s been a bad season for Kendrick, who\u2019s given up 27 home runs in 117 innings. He was on the disabled list Aug. 1 to Sept. 1 because of right-shoulder inflammation. In his first start back, he received a no-decision in Colorado\u2019s loss to Arizona last Tuesday, allowing three hits over four innings, including a solo home run to Paul Goldschmidt. In two starts against San Diego, Kendrick is 0-1 with a 7.50 ERA. Kennedy tied a career high by striking out 12 batters in a no-decision Wednesday against the Rangers, but he\u2019s also given up a lot of homers \u2014 27 in 141 . \u2026 cq\n\nTuesday: Rockies\u2019 Jon Gray (0-0, 6.15 ERA) at Padres\u2019 Colin Rea (2-2, 5.47), 8:10 p.m., ROOT\n\nWednesday: Rockies\u2019 Chris Rusin (5-7, 4.78) at Padres\u2019 James Shields (10-6, 3.83), 7:10 p.m., ROOT\n\nThursday: Rockies\u2019 Jorge De La Rosa (9-6, 4.24) at Padres\u2019 Tyson Ross (10-10, 3.21), 1:40 p.m., no TV\n\nPatrick Saunders, The Denver Post", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Giants top Rockies, split four-game series at Coors Field", "title": "Giants top Rockies, split four-game series at Coors Field", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/09/06/giants-top-rockies-split-four-game-series-at-coors-field/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150906_050518_yohan-flande.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150906_050518_yohan-flande.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-06T17:40:04+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T00:01:37+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The Giants got 14 hits to beat the Rockies 7-4, salvaging a split in the four-game series.\nThe Rockies punched Giants ace Madison Bumgarner for four runs on nine hits Sunday afternoon.\nHe went 0-for-3 with a walk, snapping his streak of six consecutive games with a home run \u2014 the longest run in Rockies history.\nThat should be enough to provide a hometown victory in front of another big, late-season crowd of 36,649 at Coors Field.\nThe Rockies finished off what could have been a sweet homestand on a sour note, finishing the eight-game set 4-4."}
