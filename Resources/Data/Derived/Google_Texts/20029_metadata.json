Features available to patients through the program include a clinic, appointment reminders and medication consultations.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve typically done a pretty good job of keeping our readmission rates low,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to do everything we can to keep patients at home.\u201d\n\nCities listed with the worst readmissions, complications and death rates were located in St. Louis, Morgantown W.Va., Peoria, Ill., La Mesa, Calif. and Miami. Information regarding readmission, complications and deaths is required to be reported from hospitals as part of the Affordable Care Act implementation.\n\nHospitals with excessive readmissions and mortality rates for specific serious conditions will begin to be penalized financially.\n\nPoints of data that were included in the study were: Rate of complications for hip/knee replacement patients; Pneumonia 30-day mortality rate; death rate for stroke patients; Heart failure 30-day readmission rate.\n\nHospitals within the Medicare Readmissions Complications and Deaths database were included in the report. Types of hospitals that were excluded from the list included psychiatric, rehabilitation, long-term care, children\u2019s, cancer, critical access hospitals, and all hospitals in the state of Maryland.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sarasota Memorial Hospital helped earn the city of Sarasota the title of No. 1 for lowest hospital readmission numbers, complications and deaths in BetterDoctor report.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Your Observer", "description": "Sarasota Memorial Hospital helped earn the city of Sarasota the title of No. 1 for lowest hospital readmission numbers, complications and deaths in BetterDoctor report.", "title": "Sarasota Memorial earns city No. 1 ranking | Sarasota | Your Observer", "url": "http://www.yourobserver.com/article/sarasota-memorial-earns-city-no-1-ranking", "image": "http://www.yourobserver.com/sites/default/files/10828_standard.jpeg", "updated_time": "2015-07-15T15:00:01-04:00", "type": "article"}, "HandheldFriendly": "true", "MobileOptimized": "width", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-07T15:20:13-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-15T15:00:01-04:00"}, "keywords": "Sarasota Memorial Hospital, BetterDoctor, hospital readmissions, surgery complications, deaths", "google-site-verification": "W5qEe1V8ciPqgo7dPyNIXQ-wHbIW1dBCGQ-dzCLvNgQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1588\"", "article_summary": "Sarasota Memorial Hospital helped earn the city of Sarasota the title of No.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve typically done a pretty good job of keeping our readmission rates low,\u201d Taylor said.\nInformation regarding readmission, complications and deaths is required to be reported from hospitals as part of the Affordable Care Act implementation.\n1 for lowest hospital readmission numbers, complications and deaths.\nHospitals within the Medicare Readmissions Complications and Deaths database were included in the report."}
