She'd been at the network for 20 years.The Post reported that attempts to contact network CEO Les Moonves about the matter went ignored, along with emails and phone calls to CBS News President David Rhodes and former \"Evening News\" Executive Producer Patricia Shevlin.Attkisson's reporting, which has focused on the perceived failures of the Obama administration, has led to a brittle relationship with the White House and her colleagues, who may have suspected that her work contained a political agenda.In her book, Attkisson writes that her reports on Solyndra, the bankrupt solar panel company that received a $535 million government loan, elicited skepticism from Shevlin: \"What's the matter, don't you support green energy?\" she claims the producer said to her. The reports were allegedly shelved by CBS.In 2011, Attkisson told conservative radio host Laura Ingraham that her report on Operation Fast and Furious (which won her an Emmy) had incensed White House officials.\"[The White House and Justice Department] will tell you that I'm the only reporter - as they told me - that is not reasonable,\" Attkisson told Ingraham. \"They say The Washington Post is reasonable, the L.A. Times is reasonable, The New York Times is reasonable, I'm the only one who thinks this is a story, and they think I'm unfair and biased by pursuing it.\"Attkisson's book, in which she also claims that her computer was hacked by a \"government-related entity,\" comes out November 4.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://www.blogsmithmedia.com/www.aol.com/assets-3af9d6a02a9854da3646959922f4fe0c/images/favicon/browserconfig.xml?v=Kmmv6Rgb5o", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Facebook, Sharyl Attki onSharyl Attki on (center), with producer Kim Skeen and editor Nancy Wyatt.
