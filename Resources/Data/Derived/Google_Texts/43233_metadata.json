John Kasich is a big spender.\n\nOhio General Revenue Fund spending was $4.6 billion greater in 2015 than in 2011, the last year of Democratic former governor Ted Strickland\u2019s second and final budget.\n\nSpending growth under Kasich, a Republican, has been driven primarily by a 34 percent increase in Ohio\u2019s Medicaid spending.\n\nOf Ohio\u2019s $30.8 billion GRF spending in 2015, a staggering $3.4 billion went to Kasich\u2019s Obamacare expansion, putting working-age adults with no kids and no disabilities on Medicaid.\n\nThrough Kasich\u2019s first two biennial budgets, GRF spending increased by an average of 4.4 percent per year based on the latest data from the Ohio Legislative Service Commission.\n\nOhio\u2019s government spending under Kasich has grown at a much faster rate than inflation and population growth combined.\n\nRELATED: Ohio\u2019s Budget: Is bigger better?\n\nIn fiscal year 2010 while Ohio was being thrashed by a national recession, Strickland cut spending almost 10 percent \u2014 only to increase spending nearly 9 percent the following year with help from President Obama\u2019s \u201cstimulus.\u201d\n\nThe first year of Kasich\u2019s first budget increased spending only slightly, but Kasich and the Republican-dominated Ohio General Assembly have increased spending at an accelerating rate ever since.\n\n\u201cGov. Kasich has increased spending at a rapid pace. He has cut personal income taxes a small amount. He treats that as a victory,\u201d Nicole Kaeding, a budget analyst for the libertarian Cato Institute, said in an email to Ohio Watchdog.\n\n\u201cImagine the size of the tax cuts for Ohio businesses and families if Kasich hadn\u2019t championed higher spending,\u201d Kaeding said.\n\nShe warned that the fiscal effects of Kasich\u2019s Medicaid expansion \u2014 roughly $1.5 billion over budget in its first 18 months \u2014 will hit state taxpayers soon. Obamacare pays for 100 percent of the expansion until 2017.\n\n\u201cSoon, Ohio taxpayers will owe a share of the expansion budget,\u201d Kaeding said. \u201cAnd, it could be made worse if Congress decides to decrease the federal contribution \u2014 something both parties in Washington have supported previously.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Red states still grasping at Obamacare Medicaid cash\n\nIncreasing tax revenues and federal funding have given Kasich and the General Assembly room to cut income tax rates and end Ohio\u2019s estate tax while still cranking up spending.\n\nIn 2015, $9.4 billion of Ohio\u2019s GRF spending came from the federal government. Only in 2011, with \u201cstimulus\u201d money pouring into the state, were federal funds a larger share of Ohio\u2019s GRF budget.\n\nOhio\u2019s 2016-17 budget will only accelerate Ohio\u2019s spending and dependence on the feds. GRF spending is expected to increase 13.1 percent in 2016 and another 4.2 percent in 2017, with over $12 billion coming from Washington, D.C., each year.\n\nAfter increasing by almost 10 percent in 2015, Ohio\u2019s Medicaid spending is expected to skyrocket by 22 percent in 2016. Kasich\u2019s Obamacare expansion will cost more than $7 billion in the next two years.\n\nIf the Ohio Legislative Service Commission\u2019s estimates prove accurate, Ohio\u2019s government will spend $4 billion more in 2016 than in 2015.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Another state fiscal year is in the books, and the numbers don't lie: Ohio Gov.
