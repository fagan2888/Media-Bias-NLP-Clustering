Trump has unveiled his first ads of the 2016 presidential cycle, radio spots that will air over the next two weeks in the first three voting states \u2014 Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina.\n\nThe ads were posted to his website on Tuesday morning.\n\nOne ad, completely narrated by Mr. Trump, is like a 60-second condensed and speed-read version of the candidate\u2019s often meandering stump speech.\n\nIt promises \u201cthe greatest trade deals we ever made in our country,\u201d bringing jobs back, taking care of veterans and making our military \u201cso strong that no one will mess with us,\u201d that we \u201cwill have a wall,\u201d protecting the Second Amendment and repealing President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe two ads do not attack any of his Republican rivals, or even his Democratic ones, by name, but they do feature a broadside attack.\n\n\u201cPoliticians are all talk, no action,\u201d Mr. Trump says. \u201cMy opponents have no experience in creating jobs or making deals.\u201d\n\nThe second ad features a female voice as the narrator, and touches on many of the similar parts of Mr. Trump\u2019s platform as his own voiced ad does.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to make America great again, maybe greater than ever before,\u201d the ad concludes.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20151105085426, "BN": "first-draft", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us/politics/firstdraft", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/first-draft/post", "per": "Trump, Donald J", "org": "Republican Party", "keywords": "Trump Donald J,Political Advertising,Presidential Election of 2016,Radio,Republican Party,Uncategorized", "description": "\u201cPoliticians are all talk, no action,\u201d Donald J.
