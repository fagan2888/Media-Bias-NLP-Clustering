The 40-year-old rapper filed for bankruptcy this week. Stach Leszczynski/European Pressphoto Agency\n\nForget the bottles of champagne, designer threads or jewels around his neck: Rapper 50 Cent says it\u2019s not a lavish lifestyle that prompted this week\u2019s bankruptcy filing. Instead, he\u2019s pointing to the more than $20 million that two legal disputes have cost him.\n\nIn court documents filed Thursday night, the 40-year-old rapper, whose real name is Curtis James Jackson III, said his bankruptcy filing isn\u2019t \u201ca result of excessive current expenses\u201d but is due to \u201csubstantial costs of litigation.\u201d\n\nSpecifically, Mr. Jackson lost a dispute over a broken business deal to develop headphones, prompting a judge to award a former partner more than $17.2 million in October, plus interest. (Court papers now peg the value of the award at $18.4 million.) More recently, a jury determined that he should pay $5 million to a woman who said Mr. Jackson violated her privacy by posting a sex tape of her online.\n\n\u201cWhile Mr. Jackson has substantial assets, he does not have the ability to pay the full amount of these litigation claims and all other asserted claims at the present time,\u201d his lawyers said in the filing.\n\nMr. Jackson filed for chapter 11 protection on Monday, shortly before jurors were scheduled to determine whether he should pay additional damages in the sex-tape lawsuit filed in 2010 by Lastonia Leviston, rapper Rick Ross\u2019s ex-girlfriend.\n\nFiling for bankruptcy temporarily halts lawsuits, though Ms. Leviston has asked a bankruptcy judge to make an exception and allow her lawsuit to move forward. Judge Ann M. Nevins was scheduled to review that request at a hearing Friday morning.\n\nThe verdict in the sex-tape lawsuit, which accused Mr. Jackson of posting the video on his website in 2009 as part of a \u201crap war\u201d between himself and Mr. Ross, came as Mr. Jackson fights the judgment in the headphone dispute. In that business venture, an entity called Sleek Audio LLC made a deal with G-Unit Brands, Mr. Jackson\u2019s licensing company, to allow Sleek to use Mr. Jackson\u2019s trademarks. The deal fell apart when \u201cSleek failed to have the headphones ready for commercial production by the February 15, 2011, deadline,\u201d Mr. Jackson\u2019s bankruptcy lawyers said. Sleek Audio\u2019s lawyers later filed an arbitration proceeding against Mr. Jackson, accusing him of stealing the design of the \u201cSleek by 50\u201d headphones.\n\nIn bankruptcy-court papers, Mr. Jackson estimates that his assets are worth between $10 million and $50 million. He hasn\u2019t filed financial documents yet that disclose the value of his business pursuits, which include \u201cartist management, film production, footwear and apparel, fragrance, video games, publishing, headphones and health drinks and supplements,\u201d according to court papers.\n\nMr. Jackson appeared on the music scene in 2003 with hit rap song \u201cIn Da Club.\u201d He has sold more than 22 million albums and acted in films, including the boxing drama \u201cSouthpaw,\u201d which will hit theaters soon.\n\nMr. Jackson had invested in the maker of Glaceau Vitaminwater, which was sold to Coca-Cola for $4.1 billion in 2007. Industry insiders speculate that Mr. Jackson got between $40 million and $100 million from that deal.\n\nHis Farmington, Conn., mansion, once owned by boxer Mike Tyson, is reported to have 21 bedrooms, a racquetball court, a home movie theater and an eight-car garage.\n\nBut Mr. Jackson\u2019s journey to fame and fortune was famously a long one. In Thursday\u2019s court filing, the rapper\u2019s bankruptcy lawyers reminded the court of his humble origins:\n\nIt is easy to forget that Mr. Jackson grew up in proverty [sic] in South Jamaica, a rough neighborhood of Queens, New York. His single mother was murdered when Mr. Jackson was only 8 years old. After her death, he was raised by his grandparents. As a boy, Mr. Jackson dreamed of being a boxer, but by the time he was a teenager, he was caught up in a life of crime. The consequences of that lifestyle were realized in 2000 when Mr. Jackson was shot nine times outside of his grandmother\u2019s house. After recovering from his injuries, Mr. Jackson determined to improve his life and focused on his music, and the rest is music history. In many respects, Mr. Jackson typifies the American dream.\n\nWrite to Katy Stech at katy.stech@wsj.com.
