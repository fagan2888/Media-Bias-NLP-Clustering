The Texas Department of Transportation is attempting to aid in the miles-long backup on northbound Interstate 35E in Denton County, but with frigid temperatures and traffic going nowhere, sand and traction materials aren’t helping much.

Drivers are slowly crawling through the traffic nightmare that’s now lasted for about 24 hours. Traffic on I-35 began Friday morning when two 18-wheelers were unable to get enough momentum to get up a hill. They left both lanes blocked.

One right lane was open Saturday morning, but the backup remains as drivers try to unwind. And other 18-wheelers are getting stuck in the same spot as they try to get through. TxDOT crews are on the scene, trying to de-ice the road and helping each 18-wheeler that gets stuck find traction so the traffic can continue to unwind.

“We had to sit up there and keep doing this over and over,” Michelle Releford, a TxDOT spokeswoman.

Releford said the agency is currently sending more workers to the site to try and keep things moving. She said the six inches of ice on the road has made it hard to give trucks traction and keep clear since the temperature remains below freezing.

“In some cases we have to shovel aggregate-type salt and sand for traction underneath the wheels for the big rigs,” she said. “We have to go to real extremes.”

With temperatures not reaching past the mid-20s today, treacherous streets and dangerous highway overpasses are still an issue throughout North Texas. Much of the slush from the winter storm has refrozen, making roads that weren’t already iced over slick.

“During this time and with any major weather event, I’d advise that if you don’t have to go out don’t travel,” said meteorologist Joe Harris.
