(Updated: As the comment below notes, Target has responded positively to the concerns expressed by people across the county and issued a statement requesting customers not to bring firearms to their stores.)

The good people at Everytown for Gun Safety have launched petition drive to demand that Target stores join the growing list of responsible companies that ban customers from openly toting weapons in their businesses.

This is from a recent appeal by a concerned mom in San Antonio, Texas named Jamie Addams:

“Which seems more threatening to you? A group of moms openly carrying babies and petitions, or a rally of men and women openly carrying loaded semiautomatic rifles? According to Target, it’s the moms. Our volunteers in San Antonio were supposedly asked to leave because Target provides a ‘distraction free’ shopping environment. I don’t know about you, but I think the open carry of loaded semiautomatic rifles in Target stores and parking lots is pretty distracting when I’m out shopping with my kids. Sign the petition to Target today and tell them that welcoming gun extremists and kicking out moms and kids is completely #OffTarget: http://act.everytown.org/sign/target-petition/“
