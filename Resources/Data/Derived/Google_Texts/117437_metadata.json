I\u2019ll shamelessly build on his, since he already did the groundwork.\n\nThat decline doesn\u2019t just represent a shift from subsidized to unsubsidized loans, either; the unsubsidized ones dropped by over twenty percent. And Pell grants dropped by over fourteen percent, so it wasn\u2019t a massive shift from loans to grants. The only student loans to grow over the last five years have been for graduate school, which actually accounts for a much larger piece of the student loan pie than is generally acknowledged.\n\nMy first guess is that it\u2019s a combination of a gradual climb out of the Great Recession and the rapid and severe decline of enrollment at for-profits.\n\nThe climb out of the Great Recession could matter in a few ways. First, it tends to depress enrollments at community colleges, where enrollments are usually countercyclical. Generally, the weaker the economy, the greater the number of people who enroll at community colleges, and vice versa. It makes sense if you look at the opportunity cost of enrollment. If enrolling means working less, that\u2019s one thing. If there aren\u2019t any jobs to be had, though, and the alternative to enrolling is basically nothing, then enrolling becomes more attractive. Within higher education, we tend to assume that colleges compete with each other for students, and sometimes that\u2019s true. But sometimes, especially in the community college sector, we compete with work.\n\nBut wait, you say, don\u2019t enrolled students often work thirty or forty hours a week for pay anyway? Yes, and often to their academic detriment. But during the worst of the recession, they tended to work fewer hours because there were fewer hours to be had. At Holyoke, at the low point of the recession, we had the highest percentage of work-study hours actually used in the college\u2019s history. A couple of years later, the percentage returned to its usual level. For a while there, work-study was pretty much the only game in town. It isn\u2019t much, but it\u2019s more than nothing.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see a trend among community colleges now that would show FTE\u2019s dropping faster than headcounts, as more students move from full-time to part-time to accommodate the greater work hours they can get now. That would decrease their need for student loans, at least in any given year. (Tip for enterprising grad students looking for research topics: trace the impact of the Affordable Care Act on full-time/part-time enrollment ratios. Once you didn\u2019t need to be full-time to get health insurance, well\u2026)\n\nThe other impact, obviously, is that students whose parents may not have been in a position to help with college a few years ago may be able to get more parental help now.\n\nFor-profit college enrollments have declined drastically over the last five years, sometimes resulting in campus closures, and sometimes as results of campus closures. For-profits always consumed far more than their proportional share of federal student aid, so as students move either to work or to other sectors of higher education, the draw on the Federal budget is dropping.\n\nTo the extent that the talk of \u201cbubbles\u2019 still may make sense, it\u2019s in graduate schools. But I\u2019ll leave that to the folks who are closer to it. (The data in Kelchen\u2019s piece don\u2019t speak to \u201cprivate\u201d loans, though my anecdotal sense is that they, too, peaked a few years ago. I\u2019m certainly open to correction on that point if someone has better information.)\n\nJust last week,the Hechinger report purported to blow the lid off of the supposed boondoggle of Pell grants. Now we know that Pell grant funding is down, both in absolute terms and as a percentage of the cost of attendance. As boondoggles go, I\u2019m not impressed.\n\nThis may all seem technical and wonky, but people base life decisions and political views on assumptions about student loans that simply aren\u2019t true. Decisions based on bad information can do real damage. Let\u2019s tell the real story, and stop blowing bubbles.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "https://www.insidehighered.com/sites/all/themes/ihecustom/images/facebook_icon_large.jpg", "description": "The drop in federal student loan volume.", "title": "Meanwhile, a Bubble Quietly Deflates | Confessions of a Community College Dean"}, "msapplication-config": "/IEconfig.xml", "description": "The drop in federal student loan volume.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "follow, index"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd90e7\"", "article_summary": "Generally, the weaker the economy, the greater the number of people who enroll at community colleges, and vice versa.\nFirst, it tends to depress enrollments at community colleges, where enrollments are usually countercyclical.\nDid you know that Federal subsidized student loans, measured in dollars lent, have dropped more than forty percent over the last five years?\nThis may all seem technical and wonky, but people base life decisions and political views on assumptions about student loans that simply aren\u2019t true.\nThat would decrease their need for student loans, at least in any given year."}
