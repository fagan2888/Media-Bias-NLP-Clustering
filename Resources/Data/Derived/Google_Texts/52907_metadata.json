This is a demonstration,\u201d said Rolling Thunder national spokeswoman Nancy Regg. \u201cThis is not a biker event. There\u2019s no picnic at the end, It\u2019s to show the government that we\u2019re still here, we want answers, and we want our veterans taken care of.\u201d\n\nSEE ALSO: Ballfield to battlefield: Elmer Gedeon was 1 of 2 major league players to die in WWII\n\nNamed for the low rumble created by the thousands of motorcycles weaving their way through D.C. streets, the event highlights the work still to be done to bring home POWs and MIA troops, or at the very least provide some closure for their families.\n\n\u201cWe have made tremendous strides in helping our veterans, our POWs and MIAs,\u201d Ms. Regg said. \u201cAlmost monthly a family gets closure \u2014 as far back as World War II and Korea. So we are getting closure for families and that\u2019s really important.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s where the behemoth rolling demonstration comes in, explained Edward Rutledge, co-chairman of the government affairs arm of Rolling Thunder.\n\nPHOTOS: Memorial Day Parade 2014\n\nMotorcycles are assembling in the north and south Pentagon parking lots from 7 a.m. Sunday, with an anticipated start at 12 p.m. The speakers\u2019 program is scheduled to begin at 1 p.m.\n\n\u201cIf we came in cars, D.C. police would just say it\u2019s a traffic jam,\u201d Mr. Rutledge said. \u201cBikes let you know we are here. It\u2019s impressive. People have to stop and say, \u2018Hey, Rolling Thunder is here. What\u2019s it all about?\u2019\u201d\n\nWhile Sunday is a day to watch and cheer as more than 500,000 motorcycles pass by the monuments and memorials, that doesn\u2019t mean attention to military members should stop after the ride is over.\n\nMr. Rutledge\u2019s arm of Rolling Thunder follows the various pieces of legislation important to the organization during each congressional session.\n\nLegislation on the group\u2019s radar this year includes House and Senate resolutions that support leaving no member of the armed forced unaccounted for as the country withdraws from Afghanistan, as well as a Senate bill that directs the architect of the Capitol to place a chair on the Capitol grounds in remembrance of POWs and MIAs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very, very important we understand POW/MIA issues,\u201d Mr. Rutledge said. \u201cGet some of the legislation passed into law, bring them all home and concentrate on all vets, too.\u201d\n\nFor the past quarter-century, Rolling Thunder has highlighted the plight of Vietnam veterans, and relied on support of their advocates to bolster the number of riders.\n\nMs. Regg pointed out, however, that each year Rolling Thunder ages, so does everyone involved.\n\nThat means it\u2019s about time the next generation began to take up the reins, and Nikki Mendicino is one of those to do it.\n\nThis will be Ms. Mendicino\u2019s 15th Rolling Thunder, and she\u2019ll be one of the event\u2019s featured speakers.\n\nAt 25, she has attended the rolling rally more than half her life. She first became interested in veterans\u2019 causes when she was introduced to a World War II veteran who spoke at her grade school.\n\nShe said in recent years, more veterans from the nearby hospitals have come to watch Rolling Thunder, many of them returning to watch the next year.\n\n\u201cI think there definitely needs to be a push of younger members, getting the younger generations out there,\u201d she said.\n\nMs. Mendicino said the way to do that is exposure. Whether that means introducing a veteran to a classroom or bringing one\u2019s children to a rally like Rolling Thunder.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that the younger generations don\u2019t care, they don\u2019t know,\u201d she said.\n\nMs. Mendicino\u2019s fellow speakers on Sunday include Navy veteran Shane Osborn, a candidate for Nebraska state treasurer; Air Force veteran Myke Shelby, owner of Harley-Davidson outlet in San Diego; and Lynn O\u2019Shea, research director for the National Alliance of Families.\n\nRolling Thunder will likely be the most attended event of the weekend, but others are scheduled for the holiday. At 9 p.m. Friday a candlelight vigil is scheduled at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. Harley-Davidson of Washington is hosting a barbecue from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday, and a visit to the U.S. Navy Memorial is scheduled for 11 a.m. Saturday.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of real personal moments,\u201d Ms. Regg said. \u201cYou cry, you laugh, you cry some more, laugh some more. You see people you haven\u2019t seen in a year, meet new friends, meet old friends. It\u2019s just an amazing weekend.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Independence Day has fireworks, Christmas has carolers, but the soundtrack to Memorial Day features the thunder of a half-million roaring motorcycles.", "Author": "Meredith Somers", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Independence Day has fireworks, Christmas has carolers, but the soundtrack to Memorial Day features the thunder of a half-million roaring motorcycles.", "title": "MEMORIAL DAY: Rolling Thunder ready for 27th ride through D.C.", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/may/22/memorial-day-rolling-thunder-ready-for-27th-ride-t/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/05/22/5_222014_ap1049479539278201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/05/22/5_222014_ap1049479539278201.jpg", "title": "MEMORIAL DAY: Rolling Thunder ready for 27th ride through D.C.", "description": "Independence Day has fireworks, Christmas has carolers, but the soundtrack to Memorial Day features the thunder of a half-million roaring motorcycles.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "War Conflict, Nancy Regg, Edward Rutledge"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd9d6\"", "article_summary": "Independence Day has fireworks, Christmas has carolers, but the soundtrack to Memorial Day features the thunder of a half-million roaring motorcycles.\nMr. Rutledge\u2019s arm of Rolling Thunder follows the various pieces of legislation important to the organization during each congressional session.\nThis will be Ms. Mendicino\u2019s 15th Rolling Thunder, and she\u2019ll be one of the event\u2019s featured speakers.\nSo we are getting closure for families and that\u2019s really important.\u201dThat\u2019s where the behemoth rolling demonstration comes in, explained Edward Rutledge, co-chairman of the government affairs arm of Rolling Thunder.\nPHOTOS: Memorial Day Parade 2014Motorcycles are assembling in the north and south Pentagon parking lots from 7 a.m. Sunday, with an anticipated start at 12 p.m."}
