Republican Texas Gov. Rick Perry has turned his recent indictment into a fundraising push, selling T-shirts bearing his mug shot and the word “Wanted” plastered above his head.

The shirts, selling for $25 on Mr. Perry’s fundraising website, say below the mug shot that he is wanted “For securing the border and defeating Democrats.”

The back of the shirts feature a photo of District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who Mr. Perry has been targeting since his indictment.

Ms. Lehmberg’s side of the shirt says that she is “Guilty” of “driving while intoxicated and perversion of justice.”

A grand jury indicted Mr. Perry Aug. 15 on charges that he attempted to use his power as governor to punish state prosecutors investigating public corruption.

Mr. Perry has been accused of threatening to withhold $7.5 million in funding for the anti-corruption unit run by Ms. Lehmberg unless she resigned.

But the governor maintains that he was taking action only in response to Ms. Lehmberg’s arrest for drunk driving, where her blood-alcohol content was almost three times the legal limit.
