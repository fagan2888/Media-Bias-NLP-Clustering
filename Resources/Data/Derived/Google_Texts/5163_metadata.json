It was neither what she expected nor one she had ever heard before. More often than not the response would be Michelangelo\u2019s David or the Ponte Vecchio or the Ufizzi Gallery.\n\nOne of the most overlooked aspects of travel is how we perceive a destination and, in many places, the light can make all the difference in the world. Quite often, the light can have a significant impact on the way you remember a place and the experiences you had there.\n\nIn Florence, Italy make your way to the Piazzale Michelangelo overlooking the Arno River and the city. Go just before sunset. There are places to relax and enjoy a drink at day\u2019s end while you savor the misty earth-tones that envelope the city. Egg-shell whites, toasted yellows and rust-colored ambers permeate the surroundings. The noted author and adventurer, Paul Theroux, once described it as \u201ca watercolor of itself.\u201d\n\nMuch of what makes Italy a favorite destination is the uninhibited way light plays with your emotions. There\u2019s a reason why Frances Mayes titled her book \u201cUnder the Tuscan Sun.\u201d The soft scrim of Tuscan light is infectious as it is absorbed through the pores to penetrate your soul; a delightful contagious disease for which there is no cure.\n\nAll light is not the same, however. The dappled sunshine and shadows of Northern France are distinctly different than the soft pastels of Tuscany.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see why the Impressionist art movement was born in Normandy. Artists can barely apply paint to the canvas before the light changes. It\u2019s a place where puffy white clouds often yield to layers of deep billowing mushroom gray thunderheads that constantly play with silhouettes and shapes.\n\nThe tiny harbor village of Honfleur and the port of Le Havre were favorite locations for the Impressionists, as they are for artists today. The term \u201cImpressionism\u201d was coined when an art critic referred to Sunrise, a painting by Claude Monet in 1872, as \u201cImpressionism.\u201d It was intended to be derogatory. The rebellious Impressionists liked the name however, and soon Impressionism was all the rage.\n\nMost Impressionist paintings were made en plein air, or outdoors, where reflections and shadows provided an airy freshness never before captured on canvas. The fleeting nature of Normandy\u2019s light with its swiftly alternating play of color from object to object was central to the Impressionist movement.\n\nFurther north, Scandinavian light is completely different. In Norway and Sweden, colors are brilliant and bold featuring chiseled high definition palettes of reality revealed in their purest primary richness.\n\nTuscan light seems almost out of focus when compared to the sharply delineated aspects of its Scandinavian counterpart. Rapeseed, a summer crop grown as feed for livestock, has a yellow blossom that is so brilliant that you almost need sunglasses to look at it.\n\nTraditional red houses with white trim appear to be sculpted within the forest green settings of their Nordic woodlands. Colors are almost primeval in their intensity. Scandinavian light is illuminating in a way that is impossible to be ignored.\n\nWhen summer sunsets slowly scrape the horizon with the glow of Scandinavia\u2019s long days\u2019 journeys into night, the rays of eternal sunshine can even make sleeping a challenge.\n\nEven parts of the Middle East have a special aura about them. When viewed from the top of the Mount of Olives, just above the Garden of Gethsemane, Old Jerusalem conjures a sense of traveling back to biblical times.\n\nThough the light resembles the earth-tones of Tuscany, Old Jerusalem retains a unique serenity that is magnified by its history. Here sand-colored desert buildings sprawl behind ancient walls where the roof of the Dome of the Rock glistens in the sun.\n\nIn nearby Jordan, the ridge of Mount Nebo is where Moses is said to have viewed the Promised Land for the first time. From the summit, another phenomenon frequently alters the light that streams into the valley below.\n\nWhen clouds overtake the vast expanse of the valley, pinholes open in the atmosphere allowing the sun to splay its rays onto the desert floor. The multiple beams of misty light spray from the dusky canopy like majestic spotlights showering the earth. It is difficult not to be affected by the sensation of omnipotence from those heavenly rays, leaving little doubt as to how they might have had a dramatic impact on Moses.\n\nTo paraphrase the title of Milan Kundera\u2019s novel, travelers should immerse themselves in the \u201cbearable being of lightness.\u201d If you do, you will be richly rewarded with an aspect of travel that goes largely unnoticed.\n\nAll you need to do is emerge from the dark ages to savor the joys of traveling light.\n\nBob Taylor is a veteran writer who has traveled throughout the world.
