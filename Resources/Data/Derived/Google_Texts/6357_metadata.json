(Photo: AP)\n\nBeing uninsured in America will cost you more in 2015.\n\nIt's the first year taxpayers must report to the Internal Revenue Service whether they had health insurance for the previous year, as required under President Barack Obama's law. Those who were uninsured face fines, unless they qualify for one of about 30 exemptions, most of which involve financial hardships.\n\nDayna Dayson of Phoenix estimates that she'll have to pay $290 when she files her federal return. Dayson, who is in her early 30s, works in marketing and doesn't have a lot left over each month after housing, transportation and other fixed costs. She'd like health insurance but she couldn't afford it in 2014, as required by the law.\n\n\"It's touted as this amazing thing, but right now, for me, it doesn't fit into my budget,\" she said.\n\nRyan Moon of Des Moines, Iowa, graduated from college in 2013 with a bachelor's in political science, and is still hunting for a permanent job with benefits. He expects to pay a fine of $95. A supporter of the health care law, he feels conflicted about its insurance mandate and fines.\n\n\"I hate the idea that you have to pay a penalty, but at the same time, it helps other people,\" said Moon, who is in his early 20s. \"It really helps society, but society has to be forced to help society.\"\n\nFines increase in 2015\n\nGoing without health insurance has always involved financial risks. You could have an accident and end up with thousands of dollars in medical bills. Now, you may also get fined. In a decision that allowed Obama's law to advance, the Supreme Court ruled in 2012 that the coverage requirement and its accompanying fines were a constitutionally valid exercise of Congress' authority to tax.\n\nIn 2015, all taxpayers have to report to the IRS on their health insurance status the previous year. Most will check a box. It's also when the IRS starts collecting fines from some uninsured people, and deciding if others qualify for exemptions.\n\nWhat many people don't realize is that the penalties go up significantly in 2015. Only 3 percent of uninsured people know what the fine for 2015 will be, according to a recent poll by the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nFiguring out your potential exposure if you're uninsured isn't simple.\n\nFor 2014, the fine is the greater of $95 per person or 1 percent of household income above the threshold for filing taxes. It will jump in 2015 to the greater of 2 percent of income or $325. By 2016, the average fine will be about $1,100, based on government figures.\n\nPeople can get a sense of the potential hit by going online and using the Tax Policy Center's Affordable Care Act penalty calculator.\n\nDeadline comes Feb. 15\n\nMany taxpayers may be able to get a pass. Based on congressional analysis, tax preparation giant H&R Block says roughly 4 million uninsured people will pay penalties and 26 million will qualify for exemptions from the list of more than 30 waivers.\n\nBut it's unclear whether taxpayers are aware of the exemptions.\n\nDeciding what kind of waiver to seek could be crucial. Some can be claimed directly on a tax return, but others involve mailing paperwork to the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nTax preparation companies say the IRS has told them it's taking steps to make sure taxpayers' returns don't languish in bureaucratic limbo while HHS rules on their waivers.\n\nTurboTax has created a free online tool called \"Exemption Check\" for people to see if they may qualify for a waiver. Charges apply later if the taxpayer files through TurboTax.\n\nTiming will be critical for uninsured people who want to avoid the rising penalties for 2015.\n\nThat's because Feb. 15 is the last day of open enrollment under the health law.\n\nOnline\n\n\u2022Tax Policy Center ACA penalty calculator\n\n\u2022TurboTax Exemption Check\n\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
