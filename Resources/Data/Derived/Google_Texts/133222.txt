Survey: Michigan employers prefer pre-Obamacare health care system

A majority of employers in Southeast Michigan said in a recent survey that they believe the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act has worsened the nation’s health care system.



But only 2 percent of 118 employers surveyed said they are undecided on whether to terminate their employer-sponsored health insurance group coverage, said the survey by Livonia-based American Society of Employers.



At least 98 percent plan to continue employer-sponsored coverage, but many continue to tweak their offerings in a variety of ways to reduce costs.



“The vast majority don’t think (the Affordable Care Act) was an improvement over the (previous) health care system,” said Kevin Marrs, vice president and director of survey services for the association.





89 percent of employees will or might experience increases in their health care costs in 2015, up from 83 percent in last year’s survey. Employees will pay higher deductibles, co-pays and co-insurance.

72 percent have or plan to implement changes to their prescription drug plans. This will involve the increased use of prescription formularies where lower copayments will be used to encourage lower-cost drugs.

71 percent have or plan to implement or expand wellness programs.
