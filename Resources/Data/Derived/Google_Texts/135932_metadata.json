They bought policies on the newly created New York State exchange. But when they called doctors and hospitals in Manhattan to schedule appointments, they were dismayed to be turned away again and again with a common refrain: \"We don't take Obamacare,\" the umbrella epithet for the hundreds of plans offered through the president's signature health legislation.\n\n\n\n\"Anyone who is on these plans knows it's a two-tiered system,\" said Ms. Moses, describing the emotional sting of those words to a successful entrepreneur.\n\n\"Anytime one of us needs a doctor,\" she continued, \"we send out an alert: 'Does anyone have anyone on an exchange plan that does mammography or colonoscopy? Who takes our insurance?' It's really a problem.\"\n\nThe goal of the Affordable Care Act, which took effect in 2013, was to provide insurance to tens of millions of uninsured or under-insured Americans, through online state and federal marketplaces offering an array of policies. By many measures, the law has been a success: The number of uninsured Americans has dropped by about half, with 20 million more people gaining coverage. It has also created a host of new policies for self-employed people like Ms. Moses, who previously had insurance but whose old plans were no longer offered.\n\nYet even as many beneficiaries acknowledge that they might not have insurance today without the law, there remains a strong undercurrent of discontent. Though their insurance cards look the same as everyone else's \u2014 with names like Liberty and Freedom from insurers like Anthem or United Health \u2014 the plans are often very different from those provided to most Americans by their employers. Many say they feel as if they have become second-class patients.\n\nThis disappointment is fueling renewed interest in a \"public option\" that would supplement current offerings. That idea found support from both Senator Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton as the Affordable Care Act was making its way through Congress. It was taken up again last week by Mrs. Clinton, when she suggested allowing people 55 and over to buy into Medicare, the government-run insurance for people 65 and over, which is accepted by virtually all hospitals.\n\nSome early studies of the impact of the Affordable Care Act plans are proving patients' grumbling justified: Compared with the insurance that companies offer their employees, plans provide less coverage away from patients' home states, require higher patient outlays for medicines and include a more limited number of doctors and hospitals, referred to as a narrow network policy. And while employers tend to offer their workers at least one plan that allows them coverage to visit doctors not in their network, patients buying insurance through A.C.A. exchanges in some states do not have that option, even if they're willing to pay higher premiums.\n\nMore from The New York Times:\n\nAn Unexpected Legacy for Obama: 2 Full Terms at War\n\nStart-Ups, Preaching Transparency, Settle Disputes in the Dark\n\nBrazil's Graft-Prone National Circus, Clown Included", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "partnerstory", "description": "Even as many beneficiaries acknowledge Obamacare gave them insurance, there remains a strong undercurrent of discontent, The New York Times reports.", "news_keywords": "Obamacare, Affordable Care Act, health insurance, health care, premiums, ACA, managed care, doctors, insurance", "author": "By Elisabeth Rosenthal", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "Even as beneficiaries acknowledge Obamacare gave them insurance, there remains a strong undercurrent of discontent, The New York Times reports.", "title": "For Obamacare recipients, a common refrain: 'Sorry, we don't take it here'", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2016/05/14/new-york-times-digital-news-analysis-sorry-we-donat-take-obamacare.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2015/12/22/103260981-GettyImages-501447636.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Even as beneficiaries acknowledge Obamacare gave them insurance, there remains a strong undercurrent of discontent, The New York Times reports.", "title": "News Analysis: Sorry, We Don\u2019t Take Obamacare", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2016/05/14/new-york-times-digital-news-analysis-sorry-we-donat-take-obamacare.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2015/12/22/103260981-GettyImages-501447636.1910x1000.jpg"}, "site": "@CNBC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "CNBC Business News and Finance", "app_store_id": 398018310}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398018310", "keywords": "Obamacare, Obamacare, United States, Bernie Sanders, Politics, New York, Medicaid, Medicare, US: News, Inside Wealth, business news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnbc", "published_time": "2016-05-15T10:43:38-0400", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/CNBC", "section": "Obamacare", "modified_time": "2016-05-15T10:53:23-0400", "tag": "Inside Wealth", "expiration_time": "2016-06-13T00:00:00-0400"}, "pageNodeId": 103636193, "GOOGLEBOT": "unavailable_after: Mon, 13 Jun 2016 4:00:00 GMT"}, "article_summary": "That idea found support from both Senator Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton as the Affordable Care Act was making its way through Congress.\nAmy Moses and her circle of self-employed small-business owners were supporters of President Obama and the Affordable Care Act.\n\"Anyone who is on these plans knows it's a two-tiered system,\" said Ms. Moses, describing the emotional sting of those words to a successful entrepreneur.\nBut when they called doctors and hospitals in Manhattan to schedule appointments, they were dismayed to be turned away again and again with a common refrain: \"We don't take Obamacare,\" the umbrella epithet for the hundreds of plans offered through the president's signature health legislation.\nexchanges in some states do not have that option, even if they're willing to pay higher premiums."}
