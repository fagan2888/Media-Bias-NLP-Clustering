Vegetable prices have also increased by 20 percent.\n\nThe health system tries to make up for the price increases by buying from other areas, like Chile, Washington and Mexico.\n\nAt University of California, San Francisco Medical Center, the rising cost of food has challenged the budget, said Dan Henroid, director of nutrition and food services.\n\nHenroid said romaine lettuce has spiked by 40 percent and grass-fed beef has risen by 11 percent.\n\nSince 80 percent of its food volume is not for patients they are able to make adjustments more quickly. Instead of printed menus, the medical center has a digital menu board that can be changed rapidly. Having that dynamic menu helps reduce its food costs.\n\nWhen romaine went up, food services staff put only mixed greens and spinach in salads, or used a much smaller portion of romaine. They also put things like \u201cseasonal fruit\u201d on the menu (without naming anything specifically) and use the least expensive ones available at the time. They offer specials that highlight less expensive foods and minimize proteins by offering things like a Vietnamese rice bowl that comes with only chicken or tofu instead of beef.\n\nThey also watch the market, do price comparisons and get quotes from more than one vendor.\n\nMaking small changes like UCSF has can cut a 10 percent increase in half, said Tom Wessling, vice president of nutrition and environmental services at Amerinet Inc. Hospitals can do things like switch from a 5-ounce chicken breast to a 4-ounce one without people noticing much. They can garnish salads with two tomato wedges instead of four. If broccoli, for instance, is affected by drought, they can reduce the amount of times per week they use it or serve it every other week. Frozen vegetables and fruit can also be purchased less expensively than fresh.\n\n\u201cA lot of facilities are trying to provide healthy food, but as long as they have some kind of green veggie there, that is OK,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are pretty flexible and can adapt.\u201d\n\nThe biggest opportunity for dramatically reducing costs, Wessling said, is for buyers to use market forecasts. Forecasts, he noted, allow hospital food buyers to know what is going up and down so they can substitute when needed.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/simple-steps-reduce-food-costs", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/modules/open_graph/hfn-stacked.jpeg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "The drought in California has everyone concerned that food prices will skyrocket, but so far, the impact of the severe weather has been low for most hospitals, and where felt, strategies have been implemented to minimize the damage.", "title": "Simple steps reduce food costs"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/modules/open_graph/hfn-stacked.jpeg"}, "title": "Simple steps reduce food costs", "description": "The drought in California has everyone concerned that food prices will skyrocket, but so far, the impact of the severe weather has been low for most hospitals, and where felt, strategies have been implemented to minimize the damage.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HC_Finance"}, "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no", "description": "The drought in California has everyone concerned that food prices will skyrocket, but so far, the impact of the severe weather has been low for most hospitals, and where felt, strategies have been implemented to minimize the damage.&#13; UCLA Health has been hit hardest by the cost of fruit \u2013 particularly citrus fruit, which has tripled in cost \u2013 said Guy Scimenes, the health system\u2019s financial director for nutrition services.
