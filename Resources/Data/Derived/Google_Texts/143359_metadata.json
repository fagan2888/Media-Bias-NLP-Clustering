The Rockies have one in Troy Tulowitzki. The Rockies have a new general manager in Jeff Bridich, who has said repeatedly that his \u201ceyes and ears are open\u201d to all trade possibilities.\n\nIndeed, rarely does a day go by that I don\u2019t get a tweet or an e-mail from someone asking me about the status of a Tulo trade. The inquiry usually comes from a zealous Mets fan.\n\nI get it. The \u201cHot Stove Season\u201d is fun \u2014 for fans, reporters and even harried GMs. Speculation keeps baseball from being completely swallowed up by the NFL. But a lot of rumors tend to take on a life of their own.\n\nSuch is the case with all of the Tulo talk percolating in the Big Apple.\n\nBut I\u2019m here to tell you that reports of a Tulo trade to the Mets are, in the words of one big-league executive, \u201coverblown.\u201d\n\nI talked to Tulo the other night for a story I\u2019m writing for The Sunday Denver Post, and I can tell you that he does not believe a trade is in the works.\n\nStill, it\u2019s a story that has captured the fancy of national baseball writers.\n\nOn Friday morning, Jon Heyman, the respected writer for CBSsports.com, wrote:\n\nThe Mets and Rockies have been quietly discussing a potential Troy Tulowitzki blockbuster for weeks, though it isn\u2019t known yet whether New York will have a decent chance to complete such a deal. Prized Mets pitching prospect Noah Syndergaard is said to be the centerpiece of discussions revolving around a potential package of young players in a possible deal for Tulo, though it seems like there is still quite a ways to go to have a chance to complete such a monster trade.\n\nHeyman, to his credit, makes sure to couch the trade speculation with plenty of qualifiers. In other words, the chances of the trade happening are slim.\n\nHow slim? Check out what Adam Rubin of ESPNNewYork.com wrote:\n\nThe Mets and Rockies have engaged in some talks this offseason regarding Troy Tulowitzki, but a well-placed source told ESPNNewYork.com the chances of something ever materializing are 5 percent at best. \u2026 And an insider said the Mets fans clamoring for a Tulo acquisition would go \u201cbat s\u2014\u201d if they knew the package the Rockies wanted for Tulowitzki.\u201d\n\nThere are, of course, plenty of obstacles to a blockbuster trade, not the least of which is Tulo\u2019s health and injury history. Although his rehab from hip surgery is going well, a lot of people around baseball say that Tulo needs to play and perform before he becomes a tradeable star.\n\nThen there is the money. Tulowitzki has $118 million remaining over six seasons. That\u2019s not an unreasonable contract in today\u2019s era of crazy salaries, but I would imagine the Rockies would have to pick up a chunk of that salary if the Mets were to give up some of their top young players.\n\nMy bottom line: I think Tulo is the Rockies\u2019 opening day shortstop.\n\nChew on this\n\n\u2022 The clock is ticking on Terrell Davis\u2019 next chance to make the Pro Football Hall of Fame. A group of 26 will be cut to 15 in early January and if there is any justice, the Broncos running back will take his next step to Canton.\n\nAs The Denver Post\u2019s Mike Klis noted last month, Davis has been eligible for the Hall of Fame since 2007. All nine years he has come up for vote, he has made the cut to the 25 modern-era semifinalists (there are 26 this year because there was a two-way tie for 25th). But he\u2019s never advanced from the semifinal 25 to the final 15.\n\nThat\u2019s got to change. TD, even though his career was cut short by a devastating knee injury, is a Hall of Fame player. It\u2019s not just his 2,008-yard season in 1998, or his 1,750 yards in 1997, or his 1,538 yards in 1996 that make him worthy to slip on one of those yellow blazers.\n\nThe clincher is this: In eight postseason games, from 1996-98, Davis rushed for 1,140 yards \u2014 142.5 yards per game. He gained 91 yards in his first playoff game, then ran off seven consecutive 100-yard postseason games.\n\n\u2022 Friday\u2019s happy birthday wish goes to former Broncos QB Jake Plummer. He may look like he\u2019s 22 (once he he shaved off his Sasquatch beard), but he was born on Dec. 19, 1974. Lordy, lordy, Jake the Snake is 40!\n\nPatrick Saunders: psaunders@denverpost.com or twitter.com/psaundersdp\n\n\n\nVisit denverpost.com each weekday near noontime for a serving of dish concerning Colorado\u2019s sporting landscape from a Denver Post sports writer.
