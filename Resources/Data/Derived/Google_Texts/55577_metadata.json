For a president who has repeatedly said he was elected \u201cto end wars, not start them,\u201d he\u2019s apparently decided it\u2019s critical to have the media on board.\n\nThe off-the-record meeting took place earlier that day in the Roosevelt Room of the White House, and included more than a dozen influential journalists, the Huffington Post reported.\n\nBlack firefighter cries racism, police misconduct\n\nto media; body-cam proves him wrong\n\nOf course, the Obama-friendly New York Times and Washington Post were well represented, with several writers from each newspaper on hand.\n\nA source told the Post that those present included:\n\nNew York Times columnists David Brooks, Tom Friedman and Frank Bruni and editorial writer Carol Giacomo; The Washington Post\u2019s David Ignatius, Eugene Robinson and Ruth Marcus; The New Yorker\u2019s Dexter Filkins and George Packer; The Atlantic\u2019s Jeffrey Goldberg and Peter Beinart; The New Republic\u2019s Julia Ioffe; Columbia Journalism School Dean Steve Coll; The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Jerry Seib; and The Daily Beast\u2019s Michael Tomasky.\n\nThis is the second time Obama was in a New York state of mind when faced with military action. He held a private meeting with The Times in 2013, during the infamous \u201cred-line\u201d debacle with Syria.\n\nThis time, on Aug. 29, the president sat down with Times Editor Andy Rosenthal and other members of the editorial board, along with Times opinion columnists David Brooks, Gail Collins and Ross Douthat, according to the Huffington Post.\n\nObama also met privately with a few chosen reporters during the Obamacare website rollout fiasco, including a couple hosts from the pro-Obama network MSNBC, Breitbart News reported. And he met with a number of conservative journalists \u2013 including the well-regarded Charles Krauthammer \u2014 during the government shutdown.\n\nSuch meetings may appear inappropriate, but there\u2019s nothing illegal about them, and Obama is not the first president to employ such tactics. When his predecessor did the same thing, the far-left Daily Kos called the attempt to influence the media \u201ca time-honored strategy to save a failed presidency.\u201d\n\nHow\u2019s this for ironic: When invited to one such meeting in March 2006, The New York Times declined.\n\n\u201cAs a matter of policy and practice, we would prefer when possible to conduct on-the-record interviews with public officials,\u201d Washington bureau chief Philip Taubman said in a statement at the time, according to the newspaper.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "In another attempt to manipulate the media message machine, President Obama held yet another private meeting with select journalists before last week\u2019s prime-time TV address.
