A growing number of organizations are meeting the demand by offering patients the ability to make appointments or access their records through their mobile devices. But it\u2019s now possible to also accept payments at the point of care with a mobile device by using phone add-ons like Square \u2013 a technology more and more physicians are considering.\n\nSquare, one of the biggest players in this market, offers a white cube-shaped credit card reader that attaches to a mobile phone. Entrepreneur magazine explains that the platform also provides \u201cAn online dashboard [that] tracks detailed sales data and businesses can look at charts analyzing day-to-day, week-to-week or month-to-month performance.\u201d\n\n[See also: Doctor extends good bedside manner to debt collection by starting Debt M.D.]\n\nThe vendor charges a 2.75 percent swipe fee, but also tacks on 3.5 percent and a 15 cent transaction fee if you have to key in the credit card number manually. Other vendors that offer similar services include Intuit GoPayment and PayAnywhere.\n\nTraditional credit card readers require a merchant account with a bank, an expensive reader, setup and subscription fees, plus a fee for each transaction. A recent review in PCWorld pointed out that most mobile payment systems offer pay-as-you-go plans, as well as free apps and readers. The fixed percentage fee per transaction is higher, however.\n\nIf your organization already has a reliable in-house credit card system and the vast majority of the fees you collect are done in the office or clinic, these mobile payment systems may not offer too many advantages. But that depends on the nature of your practice. If your point of care is in a patient\u2019s home, for example, this approach can make sense. Drew Nash, MD, a pediatrician in California, who makes a lot of house calls, said in a testimonial that it meets his needs and he finds it\u2019s easier than constantly taking cash and checks to the bank for deposit.\n\nBut since the technology behind mobile payment devices is relatively new, many worry about security. \u201cSmaller medical practices don\u2019t necessarily have the proper security controls in place,\u201d said Tatiana Melnik, JD, an Tampa, Fla., attorney with expertise in healthcare IT and data privacy. \u201cWhen you are looking at financial data, there are a number of federal and state rules that you have to comply with.\u201d\n\nWhile credit card theft can certainly occur using a traditional credit card terminal, Melnik\u2019s concern about mobile payment apps centers around the fact that many mobile phones contain unsecured apps, and some of these apps may contain malware. If such a rogue app is inadvertently uploaded, it can get between a mobile payment reader and the phone itself, allowing hackers to steal financial data.\n\nIn 2011, Visa released a list of best practices for companies that are developing mobile payment systems to help thwart such attacks, Melnik said. Visa recommended, for instance, that encryption be used in the card reader itself, not just the phone. Square addressed that concern in 2012 when it issued new reader cubes.\n\nNot everyone agrees that mobile payment systems are too risky. \u201cFor providers looking for more creative ways to accept payment, it\u2019s absolutely a great decision,\u201d said Jeff Hoffman, a senior partner with the advisory firm Kurt Salmon.\n\nOne of the fastest growing segments of providers\u2019 bad debt is uncollected co-payments, Hoffman said. These tools offer convenience at point of service, which may help increase this revenue stream. \u201cThe people who are complaining about data problems with a credit card swipe \u2013 it\u2019s time they entered the 21th century ... I don\u2019t think swiping your card at your doctor\u2019s office has any more risk than buying something on Amazon.com.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/mobile-payment-apps-offer-opportunities-and-risks-doctors", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/square_card_reader.jpg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "It's now possible to accept payments at the point of care with a mobile device by using phone add-ons like Square -- a technology more and more physicians are considering.", "title": "Mobile payment apps offer opportunities and risks for doctors"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HC_Finance", "image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/square_card_reader.jpg"}, "description": "It's now possible to accept payments at the point of care with a mobile device by using phone add-ons like Square -- a technology more and more physicians are considering.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Mobile payment apps offer opportunities and risks for doctors"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "As the American public becomes more mobile, it\u2019s becoming increasingly impatient with medical providers that can\u2019t keep up.
