With no rational basis, and especially when considered in light of the significantly different treatment above and beyond the referendum issue, this unequal treatment of Greensboro voters likely violates their equal protection rights.\n\nPursuant to the judge\u2019s order, here, city council elections in Greensboro this fall will proceed under the provisions of prior law. Specifically:\n\nElections for Greensboro City Council will take place using the electoral districts, method of election, and form of government that existed prior to the enactment of Session Law 2015-138. Specifically, five council members will be elected to each represent a single district as those districts existed on July 1, 2015, three council members will be elected at-large, and the mayor will be elected at-large. Terms will last for two years. Elections will proceed under the nonpartisan primary and election method of voting set forth in N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 163-294. 3. The filing period for elections for Greensboro City Council will open at 12:00 P.M. on July 27, 2015, and close at 12:00 P.M. on August 7, 2015.\n\nFor more on how the new plan became law and what it would mean for Greensboro, read here.\n\n###", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Pursuant to the judge\u2019s order, here, city council elections in Greensboro this fall will proceed under the provisions of prior law.\nThe filing period for elections for Greensboro City Council will open at 12:00 P.M. on July 27, 2015, and close at 12:00 P.M. on August 7, 2015.\nFor more on how the new plan became law and what it would mean for Greensboro, read here.\nFollowing a hearing this morning, U.S. District Judge Catherine Eagles has preliminarily blocked implementation of the Greensboro redistricting plan rammed though the General Assembly in early July.\nWith no rational basis, and especially when considered in light of the significantly different treatment above and beyond the referendum issue, this unequal treatment of Greensboro voters likely violates their equal protection rights."}
