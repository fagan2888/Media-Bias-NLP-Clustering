The percentage of adults ages 18-34 living with their parents dipped to 31.1 percent last year, the second consecutive decline from a high of 31.6 percent in 2012, according to a Trulia analysis of Census data released by the real estate website yesterday.\n\nHowever, the headship rate \u2013 or the percentage of young adults forming their own households \u2013 did not increase, and neither did the homeownership rate.\n\nRelated: Boomers Pioneer New Retirement Housing Trends\n\nInstead of renting or buying their own homes, young adults are increasingly moving into households headed by their siblings or other relatives, writes Trulia Chief Economist Jed Kolko.\n\nPart of the reason millennials aren\u2019t buying is because they can\u2019t afford to: Home prices are on the rise again in many areas, and even young people with good jobs often have to consider student loan payments when deciding whether or not they can afford to take on a mortgage.\n\nThe inertia of young adults, who have historically been more mobile than older generations, and an increasing desire among baby boomers to stay put has been a roadblock for American mobility rates, which have declined for every age group.\n\nRelated: One More Slam Against Millennials in the Workplace\n\nLast year, 11.7 percent of Americans moved, near the all-time low of 11.7 in 2011, according to a separate analysis released by Trulia today. The mobility rate has remained stubbornly low, despite an increase in job opportunities and a decrease in underwater homeowners.\n\nA continued economic recovery should lead to more people moving for jobs or because they\u2019ve finally amassed enough equity in their homes to do so, Kolko writes. \u201cYet, rising home prices and higher mortgage rates might mean that more people move in search of cheaper, rather than new or better, housing.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Five years after the Great Recession, millennials are finally starting to move out of", "title": "Millennials Still Not Moving Out on Their Own", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/09/17/Millennials-Still-Not-Moving-Out-Their-Own", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/06272013_Youth_Health_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/09/17/Millennials-Still-Not-Moving-Out-Their-Own", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/06272013_Youth_Health_article.jpg", "creator": "@bethbrav", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Five years after the Great Recession, millennials are finally starting to move out of", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2b7a\"", "article_summary": "Related: Boomers Pioneer New Retirement Housing TrendsInstead of renting or buying their own homes, young adults are increasingly moving into households headed by their siblings or other relatives, writes Trulia Chief Economist Jed Kolko.\nFive years after the Great Recession, millennials are finally starting to move out of their parents\u2019 homes \u2013 but not into their own places.\nHowever, the headship rate \u2013 or the percentage of young adults forming their own households \u2013 did not increase, and neither did the homeownership rate.\nA continued economic recovery should lead to more people moving for jobs or because they\u2019ve finally amassed enough equity in their homes to do so, Kolko writes.\nRelated: One More Slam Against Millennials in the WorkplaceLast year, 11.7 percent of Americans moved, near the all-time low of 11.7 in 2011, according to a separate analysis released by Trulia today."}
