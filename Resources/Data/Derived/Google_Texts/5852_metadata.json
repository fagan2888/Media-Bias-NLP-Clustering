Physicians and other clinicians must be involved in the planning process: All of the tools involved in the case study incorporated advice from the clinicians involved in treatment of the patients, recognizing that the tools in a vacuum do not provide enough guidance. However, non-clinical factors, such as geographic proximity and the availability of family resources, must be considered later in the discharge process, according to the report.\n\nAll of the tools involved in the case study incorporated advice from the clinicians involved in treatment of the patients, recognizing that the tools in a vacuum do not provide enough guidance. However, non-clinical factors, such as geographic proximity and the availability of family resources, must be considered later in the discharge process, according to the report. Several discharge tool designs can be used to standardize data: It is too early to commit to predictive over observational tool structures or vice versa, according to the report, and the tools used were a mix of the two.\n\nImproving the discharge summary process could also significantly reduce readmissions, FierceHealthcare previously reported, while some providers have cut readmissions by monitoring patient progress after they have returned home.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the report (.pdf)\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nTo cut readmissions, streamline discharge summary process\n\nStudy: Hospital discharge processes still need work\n\nBeth Israel Deaconess lowers readmissions with post-discharge program\n\nFollow up with patients after discharge\n\nTo reduce readmissions, focus on patient, not condition\n\nBiggest losers of readmission penalty: Big hospitals, safety nets", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hospitals can learn several lessons from the discharge planning process, according to a new case study from the American Hospital Association.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Hospitals can learn several lessons from the discharge planning process, according to a new case study from the American Hospital Association.", "title": "5 lessons from hospitals' discharge tools", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/5-lessons-hospitals-discharge-tools/2015-01-21", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "American Hospital Association (AHA),Care Delivery,discharge,Discharge Planning,Patient Care & Outcomes,post-acute care", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "article_summary": "Hospitals can learn several lessons from the discharge planning process, according to a new case study from the American Hospital Association (AHA).\nThe discussion led to numerous lessons for other hospitals and policymakers, including:Incorporate patients' needs: After discharge, hospitals must minimize care transitions by determining which care settings best suit individual patients' needs.\nTools for discharge planning must not overwhelm available resources: It is not sustainable for hospitals to continually add to their own discharge reporting burden, according to the report.\nAfter discharge, hospitals must minimize care transitions by determining which care settings best suit individual patients' needs.\nThe AHA case study incorporated five healthcare organizations, all of which shared insight on their tools for the discharge and patient assessment process with the association."}
