The company was called on by states including Minnesota to help fix troubled insurance exchanges.\n\n\u201cThe goal was to make HealthCare.gov a stable, reliable platform for people seeking coverage,\u201d said Matt Stearns, a vice president with Optum. \u201cWe did it.\u201d\n\nThe senior adviser work came with a contract valued at roughly $40 million per year. While that job is done, Optum will continue to work on other portions of the federal website.\n\nOptum is the technology division of UnitedHealth Group Inc.\n\nHealthCare.gov serves as the health insurance exchange in more than 30 states. The federal health law called for the creation of marketplaces for all 50 states, designating the exchanges as the vehicle for individuals to obtain tax credits that discount premium costs.\n\nMinnesota is one of more than a dozen states that opted to create its own health exchange, and asked Optum for advice in January 2014 on strategies for fixing its MNsure system. Optum\u2019s highest-profile work on state-based health exchanges, Stearns said, has come in Maryland, Massachusetts and Vermont.\n\nOptum\u2019s ongoing work includes a federal data hub that helps confirm whether applicants qualify for tax credits or public health insurance programs.\n\nTwitter: @chrissnowbeck", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "The UnitedHealth Group division won praise for its work on HealthCare.gov.", "title": "Optum concludes oversight for HealthCare.gov", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/optum-concludes-oversight-for-healthcare-gov/303933121/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/10007941+ee21UnitedHealthGroup.JPG?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/10007941+ee21UnitedHealthGroup.JPG?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "The UnitedHealth Group division won praise for its work on HealthCare.gov.", "title": "Optum concludes oversight for HealthCare.gov", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/optum-concludes-oversight-for-healthcare-gov/303933121/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/10007941+ee21UnitedHealthGroup.JPG?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/10007941+ee21UnitedHealthGroup.JPG?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "The UnitedHealth Group division won praise for its work on HealthCare.gov."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8e54\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe did it.\u201dThe senior adviser work came with a contract valued at roughly $40 million per year.\nWhen Optum was hired as senior adviser in October 2013, the website had become an embarrassment for the Obama administration.\nOptum is the technology division of UnitedHealth Group Inc.HealthCare.gov serves as the health insurance exchange in more than 30 states.\nWhile that job is done, Optum will continue to work on other portions of the federal website.\n\u201cThe goal was to make HealthCare.gov a stable, reliable platform for people seeking coverage,\u201d said Matt Stearns, a vice president with Optum."}
