Oh yes, the beloved Sister of Our Lady of the Bottomless Julep had known the glorious touch of a lover sullied by the pain of betrayal when it was withheld. She had loved fully, ravenously, had taken up the cup Eros set before her, touched her lips to the rim of this magic goblet and drunk deeply of the nectar within. And it had been good, at least through election season. Until the nectar curdled in her belly and her lover left her bereft, wandering her penthouse with only her memories and her portraits of good Republican men to keep her company. There had been a place for him too, her love, in her Hall of Heroes. Even now an empty frame hung on the wall, awaiting only the day when she would commission a portraitist to take his brush to canvas and commit her lover\u2019s image to immortality, a bulwark against the void of obscurity, gracelessness, and publicly funded teachers pensions.\n\nAnd then \u2013 O tempora! O mores! \u2013 the swift realization that he was like the others of his age, a self-centered politician only looking out for Number One. She had thought him better than that. \u201cOh Peggy,\u201d she crooned softly as she stared mournfully at the empty gilded frame, ice clinking against the glass she swirled in her hand. \u201cHelp me mend my broken heart\u2026and let me live agaaaaaiiiiiinnnnn\u2026.\u201d\n\nChris Christie\u2019s problem isn\u2019t that he\u2019s a bully, it\u2019s that he\u2019s selfish. Barack Obama isn\u2019t stupid and therefore the maker of mayhem, he\u2019s selfish.\n\nMark the date, people. On January 17, 2014, five years into his presidency, Barack Obama finally convinced Peggy Noonan he is not stupid. That\u2019s an accomplishment, we guess. The president should frame this column and hang it in the \u201cVenal Sociopathic Republicans\u201d wing of his future library.\n\nBut the odd thing, the destabilizing thing as you think about it, is that we\u2019re in a crisis. We\u2019ve been in it since at least 2008 and the crash, and the wars.\n\nYes, the wars, begun in 2001 under a Republican president. Your concern trolling is about twelve years too late, Pegs.\n\nWe are in unprecedented trouble. Citizens know this. It\u2019s why they buy guns. They see unfixable America around them, they think it\u2019s all going to fall apart. In Washington (and New York) they huff and puff their disapproval: Those Americans with their guns, they\u2019re causing a lot of trouble. But Americans think they\u2019re in trouble because their leaders are too selfish to face challenges that will do us in.\n\nAmericans, at least some of them, buy guns because they are paranoid lunatics who think all black teenagers are up to no good, or they are angry at people who text in movies, or because they are convinced Obama is going to send the 82nd Airborne to round them all up and send them to FEMA camps before turning the country over to the UN to implement Agenda 21. And in case you haven\u2019t noticed, it is a bunch of morons in Washington who are stopping any efforts to pass any national gun control laws while a few states have actually managed to muscle some (fairly toothless) restrictions through their legislatures. Peggy, you should really subscribe to a newspaper or something.\n\nWhat\u2019s this? AAOOOOGA! COLLISION ALARM! OBAMACARE SLAM DIRECTLY AHEAD!\n\nThere\u2019s an increasing sense in our political life that in both parties politicians call themselves public servants but act like bosses who think the voters work for them\u2026Politicians who jerk around doctors, nurses and health systems call themselves servants, when of course they look more like little kings and queens instructing the grudging peasants in how to arrange their affairs.\n\nBy duly passing a bill with a majority vote after a year of debate and combining versions written by no less than five legislative committees of Congress. You know, the sort of thing we elect legislators to do.\n\nThe president\u2019s health-insurance reform had to be breathtaking, mind-bending, historic. It had to be a Democratic Party initiative only. It required a few major lies to gain passage, but what the heck [\u2026] It was political selfishness that blew up the American health-care system.\n\nYeah, why couldn\u2019t the president be totally honest and upfront with the American people about the arms he was selling to Iran to fund right-wing death squads in Central America\u2026oops, we mean trying to get more of his countrymen access to health insurance. Sorry, our bad.\n\nEvery Peggy Noonan column is special in its own way, but it takes a special kind of cluelessness, self-absorption and moral blindness to link the governor of New Jersey closing a bridge solely to punish a town headed by a political enemy with a national effort to open up America\u2019s health insurance industry to even the poorest and sickest and most vulnerable of society. An effort that asks us all to be a little more responsible about our health care even if the trade-off is that the rapacious insurance companies do not see a shrinkage of their profit margins because heaven forfend their stockholders be asked to suffer. We think fighting that responsibility every inch of the way is the real selfishness, but we are not nearly as full of wisdom and gin as Dame Peggy.\n\n[WSJ]", "article_metadata": {"description": "She had known heartbreak, had Peggy Noonan.
