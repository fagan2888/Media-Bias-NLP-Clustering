His plan is to fund middle class tax breaks by closing loopholes that allow the wealthy to avoid taxes.\n\nHe pitched hiking the capital gains rate, eliminating the so-called \u201ctrust fund loophole\u201d by requiring high earners to pay capital gains on inherited assets and adding a new tax on big banks with a lot of debt.\n\nWhat happened to all the revenue raisers he didn\u2019t mention? Here\u2019s a look at some of the loopholes the administration has targeted in the recent past but that weren\u2019t mentioned for 2015 \u2013 at least not yet.\n\nRelated: 3 Costly and Common Tax Scams to Avoid\u200b\u200b\u200b\n\nCarried Interest Loophole: Hedge fund and private equity managers get a special kind of income tax break for what\u2019s known as \u201ccarried interest.\u201d Basically, because they operate as partnerships, some of the profits they earn are taxed as capital gains, not income.\n\nThe carried interest loophole has garnered plenty of outrage in recent years because such wealthy people benefit from it. So why didn\u2019t Obama target it?\n\nOne reason may be that it doesn\u2019t really raise the kind of dough needed to fund the tax credits Obama wants to create. The administration has estimated that eliminating this tax break would raise about $1.4 billion over the next 10 years. In contrast, the proposals the president outlined would raise $320 billion in new tax revenue over that time frame.\n\nAlso, by raising the capital gains rate, taxing carried interest as income becomes less meaningful, points out Victor Fleischer, a tax law professor at the University of San Diego. Nonetheless, he predicts that taxing carried interest as income will be part of the budget Obama sends to Congress in February.\n\nRelated: The 10 Worst States for Taxes in 2015\n\nCorporate Loopholes: President Obama has emphasized business tax reform in recent years, but aside from the new tax on big banks, he didn\u2019t have many specific proposals this week.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean more aren\u2019t coming. In his speech, Obama said, \u201cLet\u2019s close loopholes so we stop rewarding companies that keep profits abroad, and reward those that invest in America.\u201d That means new rules requiring companies to repatriate profits are likely coming.\n\nOther provisions Obama has trumpeted before, such as limiting corporations\u2019 ability to deduct interest on debt or taxing large, publicly traded partnerships as corporations, will likely be back, says Martin Sullivan, chief economist at research firm Tax Analysts.\n\n\u201cThe president is saving a lot of revenue raisers for tax reform,\u201d Sullivan says, rather than simply pairing them with tax cuts for the middle class proposed at the State of the Union.\n\nRelated: The 10 Best States for Taxes in 2015\u200b\u200b\u200b\n\nHe expects serious business tax reform to move to the front burner later this year. \u201cObama has had a long list of revenue raisers in the past,\u201d says Sullivan. The State of the Union is not the time for him to \u201cmention all of them or even come close to mentioning all of them.\u201d\n\nMortgage Interest Deduction: One of the largest tax subsidies enjoyed mainly by the wealthy is the hallowed mortgage interest deduction. It is available to anyone with a mortgage, but the benefits go mainly to the wealthy, who tend to have more expensive homes and more interest to deduct.\n\nThere have been plenty of proposals to phase it out, cap it, or turn it into a tax credit. Eliminating the deduction for second homes seems especially likely to resurface in an administration proposal. But with the housing market still wobbly, this would be an inauspicious time for Obama to include a proposal that would so obviously reduce the benefits of homeownership.\n\nFamily Trusts: By proposing to eliminate what tax experts call the \u201cstep-up in basis\u201d and Obama calls the \u201ctrust fund loophole,\u201d wealthy families stand to lose a significant way to avoid estate and gift tax. But he\u2019s not eliminating trust funds.\n\nIn fact, he\u2019s actually increasing the tax benefit of setting up a trust fund, points out Forbes staff writer Janet Novak. \u201cThe loophole Obama is aiming at has nothing to do with trusts and closing it could actually increase the tax appeal of trusts,\u201d she wrote in a recent column.\n\nRelated: 2015 Will Be a Landmark Year for State Tax Reform\n\nSemantics make it hard for Obama to tackle the \u201ctrust fund loophole\u201d and actual trust funds at the same time. This is a clear and obvious target for his stated goal of making sure the very wealthy pay their fair share of taxes.\n\nThe Buffett Rule: Floated by Obama in 2011 and defeated by the Senate in 2012, the Buffett Rule would have imposed a minimum 30 percent tax rate on people who earn a million a year. It got its name because Warren Buffett observed that he was paying a lower effective tax rate than his secretary.\n\nObama likely didn\u2019t mention it because it is dead politically. This is the kind of difficult tax reform that may be tackled at a later date and possibly could be lumped in with changes to the related and much-maligned alternative minimum tax (AMT), which still hits many middle-income taxpayers.\n\nAnother reason Buffett is on the back burner: Obama\u2019s proposed hike in the capital gains rate would reduce the gap between effective tax rates of the wealthy and the middle class without a separate rule.\n\nThe State of the Union is just the start of a renewed discussion of tax reform, say experts. While Republicans dismiss the president\u2019s current proposals as political non-starters, it isn\u2019t the last we\u2019ve heard from them. And there are many more proposals that are likely to resurface as the 2015 budget process really gets in gear.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Obama didn\u2019t mention some of his most popular ideas for closing loopholes that benefit the wealthy during his State of the Union speech.
