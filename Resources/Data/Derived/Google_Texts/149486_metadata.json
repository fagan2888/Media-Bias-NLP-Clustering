McInroy, who also volunteered at the festival's Sierra Club booth and is just getting into organized races, said she likes the sense of accomplishment that comes from setting a goal and running with a group.\n\n\"It's neat to see people who are gay out doing something healthy,\" she said. \"The run had a very community feel.\"\n\nThe 5K ended at Boulder's Central Park, where about 120 vendors and community organizations set up booths for Pridefest.\n\nElizabeth Leonard, left, and Emily Trostel skip to the finish line of the Big Gay 5K during the 12th annual Boulder Pridefest at Central Park on Sunday.

Here, we can celebrate and reconnect. We can be in a public space and be the majority.\"\n\nOut Boulder's Samantha Field added that the goal in organizing the event was appealing to all the diverse groups in the LGBTQ community.\n\n\"It's the one time of the year we get to be together and celebrate the entire community,\" she said.\n\nShe noted that the 5k run was organized in conjunction with Colorado Frontrunners to coincide with a meeting of the International Frontrunners in Denver. About 50 \"frontrunners\" registered for the run, which had about 225 participants altogether.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nColorado Frontrunners hosts weekly Saturday runs in Denver and Sunday runs in Boulder for the LGBTQ community.\n\n\"We like to encourage a healthy lifestyle and camaraderie,\" said Colorado Frontrunners President Steve Monroney. \"People have made lasting friendships in this group, and it's a good way to meet people.\"\n\nSunday's festival capped off several days of Pridefest activities, including an annual youth talent show, opening of the LGBTQ History in Boulder exhibit at the Boulder History Museum and a screening of \"Transamerica.\"\n\nSusan Grutzmacher, right, and her son, Coen Johnson, push dad, Chris Johnson, is a stroller during the 12th annual Boulder Pridefest at Central Park on Sunday.

There was also plenty of color, with participants donning everything from rainbow wigs and hats to rainbow tutus and capes.\n\nWyllow Mason, of Littleton, added wings and a unicorn horn to go with her rainbow striped knee socks.\n\n\"I love all the variety of vendors and everyone who's represented here and the inclusive atmosphere,\" she said.\n\nA Longmont transgender woman who goes by Tesla Z went with all pink, including fuzzy pink leg warmers, a pink tutu and a fuzzy pink hat.\n\n\"I love seeing all the people come together here,\" she said. \"You can feel the love.\"\n\nMost of the organizations and businesses at the festival were focused on the queer community or are queer-friendly, from a financial planner specializing in working with the gay and lesbian couples and families to Lambda's pro-bono legal services available to the LGBTQ community.\n\nBarber Linda Cox, who offered on-the-spot haircuts at the festival, works at A(s)He in Denver, a 1-year-old gender-free salon. She said one of her specialties is working with people transitioning from one gender to the other, providing help with grooming, skincare and fashion along with hair cuts and coloring.\n\n\"This is a good way to meet people and let them know we provide services no matter what your pronoun,\" she said. \"I create fleeting art. It's my artistic expression.\"\n\nIn the health and wellness area, a local roller derby team took on a local rugby football team in a game of flag football. The YMCA of Boulder Valley also sponsored an expanded youth and family area this year that included a performance stage and a storytime spot.\n\nOne of the storytime readers was Horizons K-8 teacher Jeanne Kipke, who read her book, \"Bobbi and Me.\" She said she decided to write because there's a lack of books about gender non-conforming children.\n\n\"Every year, there are one or two students who don't quite fit in the boy or girl mode,\" she said. \"I'm hoping to relate to any kids who don't feel like they fit in.\"\n\nDani Cooke, a Boulder teen who was on the event planning committee, said she wanted to create a safe, supportive place for young people.\n\n\"It's really important for youth to have a supportive place,\" she said. \"The festival is it has a really cool energy. Everyone is happy and excited.\"\n\nAmy Bounds: 303-473-1341, boundsa@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/boundsa", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_28807449/boulder-pridefest-adds-5k-run-celebrates-lgbtq-community", "sailthru.author": "By Amy Bounds \n \n  Staff Writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:28807449:view"}, "startDate": "2015-09-13T19:56:11-0600", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "Out Boulder's 12th annual Pridefest kicked off Sunday  with the Big Gay 5K, a run  that's new to Boulder \u2014 and one that participants praised for being more about fun   than competitiveness.", "title": "Boulder Pridefest adds 5K run, celebrates LGBTQ community", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_28807449/boulder-pridefest-adds-5k-run-celebrates-lgbtq-community", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0913/20150913__14DCAPRIw~1.jpg", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Boulder News", "modificationDate": "2015-09-13T20:08:04-0600", "endDate": "2025-09-13T19:53:18-0600", "news_keywords": "Boulder News, Boulder News news, Boulder Colorado Boulder News news, Boulder Colorado news, Boulder News Boulder news, Boulder News Colorado news, US Boulder News news, world Boulder News news.", "byline": "By Amy BoundsStaff", "pubDate": "2015-09-13T20:00:42-0600", "sailthru.date": "2015-09-13T19:56:11-0600", "sailthru.title": "Boulder Pridefest adds 5K run, celebrates LGBTQ community", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0913/20150913__14DCAPRIw~2_300.jpg", "description": "Out Boulder's 12th annual Pridefest kicked off Sunday  with the Big Gay 5K, a run  that's new to Boulder \u2014 and one that participants praised for being more about fun   than competitiveness.", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_28807449/boulder-pridefest-adds-5k-run-celebrates-lgbtq-community", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "Out Boulder's 12th annual Pridefest kicked off Sunday  with the Big Gay 5K, a run  that's new to Boulder \u2014 and one that participants praised for being more about fun   than competitiveness.", "title": "Boulder Pridefest adds 5K run, celebrates LGBTQ community"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0913/20150913__14DCAPRIw~2.jpg"}, "article_summary": "Out Boulder's Samantha Field added that the goal in organizing the event was appealing to all the diverse groups in the LGBTQ community.\nElizabeth Leonard, left, and Emily Trostel skip to the finish line of the Big Gay 5K during the 12th annual Boulder Pridefest at Central Park on Sunday.\nSusan Grutzmacher, right, and her son, Coen Johnson, push dad, Chris Johnson, is a stroller during the 12th annual Boulder Pridefest at Central Park on Sunday.\nAdvertisementColorado Frontrunners hosts weekly Saturday runs in Denver and Sunday runs in Boulder for the LGBTQ community.\nThe 5K ended at Boulder's Central Park, where about 120 vendors and community organizations set up booths for Pridefest."}
