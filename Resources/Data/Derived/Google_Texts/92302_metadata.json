Free agency will eventually become a big piece of cobbling together a playoff-worthy team. And the Nuggets\u2019 recent history of convincing difference-making players to play for them has been a struggle at best.\n\nMudiay, however, is a name-brand player. That will mean something, particularly if he becomes a budding star this season.\n\nHe already earned rave reviews nationally from his work during the Las Vegas summer league and kudos from his coach, Michael Malone, about being a player who looks to make others better first. Those are the building blocks of an individual that others will want to play alongside. Put all of those things together and the team could benefit in future free agency.\n\nAnd yet there were other layers to the issue.\n\nThere is the belief that East Coasters won\u2019t like a medium-sized city such as Denver. Wilson Chandler, however, chipped away at that. Two days after it was announced that Chandler re-upped with the Nuggets on a contract for four years and $46 million, he wrote what amounted to be a love letter to the city. And it was broadcast on the worldwide platform of Instagram.\n\n\u201cI made this decision because of the city of Denver, the Nuggets fans, and my teammates,\u201d Chandler wrote. \u201cI tasted what it was like to win in this great city, and I\u2019ve never been more focused to recapture that feeling. \u2026 To the fans I say an extra thank you for they are the real reason I\u2019m staying here for the long haul. Nugget nation, let\u2019s come together and turn this around!\u201d\n\nAnother East Coaster, Will Barton, signed off on the city by re-signing with the Nuggets, as did guard Jameer Nelson. In an interview after he signed an extension with the team, forward Danilo Gallinari said a large part of staying put instead of heading for next season\u2019s free-agent riches was the \u201cfact that I love the city and I like it there.\u201d\n\nIt has been the kind of summer the Nuggets can potentially build on. These were all their own free agents. The next step is getting players on the free-agent market from other teams to take a real look at Denver.\n\nNuggets general manager Tim Connelly and the front office have worked the past couple of seasons to reshape what players across the league think of the city and the franchise. The organ- ization has even taken to showing some draft prospects a bit of the city, showing what Denver has to offer.\n\nBut it starts with the players already in the league. And, as quiet as this was kept, it has been a good summer for the image of the Nuggets and Denver in the eyes of the NBA.\n\n\u201cThese guys have effectively chosen to be here and shown their affinity for the organization and the city,\u201d Connelly said. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting.\u201d\n\nChristopher Dempsey: cdempsey@denverpost.com or twitter.com/dempseypost", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Free-agent kudos provide platform for Nuggets to build on", "title": "Free-agent kudos provide platform for Nuggets to build on", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/08/29/free-agent-kudos-provide-platform-for-nuggets-to-build-on/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150829__Emmanuel-Mudiayp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150829__Emmanuel-Mudiayp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-29T21:56:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T09:31:20+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0b25\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI made this decision because of the city of Denver, the Nuggets fans, and my teammates,\u201d Chandler wrote.\nHe already earned rave reviews nationally from his work during the Las Vegas summer league and kudos from his coach, Michael Malone, about being a player who looks to make others better first.\nThe next step is getting players on the free-agent market from other teams to take a real look at Denver.\nAnd, as quiet as this was kept, it has been a good summer for the image of the Nuggets and Denver in the eyes of the NBA.\nAnd the Nuggets\u2019 recent history of convincing difference-making players to play for them has been a struggle at best."}
