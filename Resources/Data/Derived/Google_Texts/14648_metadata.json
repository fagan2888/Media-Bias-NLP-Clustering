An obvious parallel, of course, is to the speech-intolerant \u201cshut-\u2019em-down\u201d culture on many American campuses; but the actions of Black Lives Matter supporters in taking over microphones and blockading freeways have also played an important role.\n\nI begin the piece with the story of a speech I attended at a Federalist Society event last Friday at which Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) was shouted down by a squad of disrupters sent, incredibly, by the (c)(4) affiliate of a major think tank in Washington, the Center for American Progress:\n\nToday at @SenOrrinHatch's SCOTUS book event, we said #DoYourJob and vote on on a SCOTUS nominee. They didn't listen. https://t.co/L2oArOrOdU \u2014 Generation Progress (@genprogress) March 11, 2016\n\n(\u201cToday at @SenOrrinHatch\u2019s SCOTUS book event, we said #DoYourJob and vote on on a SCOTUS nominee.

And: while left-on-right disruption appears to have been more common in recent years, note also this coverage of the equally objectionable other way round, from an Austin town hall on ObamaCare. Plus, Marc Thiessen: disrupters go after Trump rallies in well-organized groups.
