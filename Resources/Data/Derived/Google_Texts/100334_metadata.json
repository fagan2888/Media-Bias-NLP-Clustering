In that session, Sens. Johnny Isakson and Saxby Chambliss briefed most House Republicans from Georgia on the Democrat-heavy Senate compromise that was headed their way.\n\nThis was the same Isakson who, days earlier, had condemned as \u201ca dumb idea\u201d the GOP use of federal paralysis as a weapon to defund Obamacare. And the same Chambliss who had declared that, by demanding the moon, House Republicans had stripped their Senate brethren of all realistic negotiating power.\n\nThat night, Isakson and Chambliss would vote to send hundreds of thousands of federal employees back to work. But at their meeting, House Republicans from Georgia decided to stick together. All nine voted against both the end of the shutdown, and the (temporary) hike in the debt-ceiling.\n\nThis was no snub of Georgia\u2019s senators \u2013 even if one of their number, Rep. Tom Graves of Ranger, was the most prominent House advocate of the \u201cdefund-or-bust\u201d strategy. In fact, Georgia members of the House haven\u2019t pushed back with a single word of criticism aimed at Chambliss or Isakson. Not in public, anyway.\n\nNo, this pact was a bet, pure and simple, with next year\u2019s primary in mind. Especially the race for Senate.\n\nOne-third of Georgia\u2019s House GOP delegation \u2013 Paul Broun of Athens, Phil Gingrey of Marietta, and Jack Kingston of Savannah \u2014 is running for Chambliss\u2019 seat.\n\nTheirs was a group wager that, in next year\u2019s war between establishment Republicans who despair of their shrinking D.C. clout and the tea party supporters in their midst, the Republican nominee for Senate from Georgia is likely to be found on the Angry Bird side of American politics.\n\nOn Friday, the Senate Conservatives Fund, a group associated with Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, endorsed the Republican challenger to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who helped negotiate an end to the shutdown.\n\nTea party heroine Sarah Palin is making noises about campaigning in Kentucky. And South Carolina, too, where Sen. Lindsey Graham has encountered GOP primary opposition.\n\nYes, a Democratic-leaning polling firm, Public Policy Polling of North Carolina, reports that the shutdown has given Michelle Nunn, the most financially viable Democrat in the Senate contest, a statistically measurable advantage in a race against any sitting Republican member of Congress.\n\nBut that is something that can be worried about next July, after the GOP runoff.\n\nWhich is what had the trio of Broun, Gingrey and Kingston advertising the bright side of closing down government, even after the effort collapsed.\n\n\u201cThe shutdown has further revealed just how disorganized, unmanageable, overreaching and unfair our federal government has become under the Obama administration,\u201d Gingrey argued.\n\n\u201cI think it was important to re-establish our brand as being against Obamacare,\u201d Kingston said in an MSNBC interview after the shutdown ended. \u201cI am telling you sometimes our base thinks we haven\u2019t driven the point enough.\u201d\n\nBroun promised more to come. \u201cThis was actually the beginning of a three-and-a-half year effort to at least get Obamacare just put on hold,\u201d he said in a WGAU (1340AM) radio interview on Friday \u2013 carefully mentioning that Kingston was not one of the original instigators of the movement, as he was.\n\nIt is clear that the shutdown has complicated the Senate race for those already in Congress. The budget/debt-ceiling agreement passed this week will resurface again in January. By that time, time we will be in an election year, and an Angry Birds strategy may not be the only approach out there.\n\nFormer secretary of state Karen Handel has been running as a non-congressional candidate, but endorsed the shutdown and its aim. So did David Perdue, a former Dollar General chief executive, who has raised more cash than anyone in the GOP race but Kingston. Perdue reported $800,000 in contributions \u2013 plus $1 million out of his own pocket \u2014 raised as of Sept. 30.\n\nBut Perdue, a political rookie, is moving toward an adult-in-the-room strategy. \u201cI think you may see I\u2019m parting ways with some of the other people in this race, because frankly, it\u2019s time to start talking about the solution here, and not what\u2019s best for one party or the other,\u201d he said Friday in a telephone interview. \u201cThis is bigger than either party. We almost defaulted.\n\n\u201cThere are two things that we have that nobody else has. We have a $16 trillion economy today. Second, we\u2019ve got the good faith and credit of the United States of America. We cannot play around with that,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "None", "og": {"url": "http://www.ajc.com/weblogs/political-insider/2013/oct/19/gop-race-senate-angry-birds-vs-adult-room/", "image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2013/10/18/85/75/Budget_Battle.JPEG-03cbb.JPG", "type": "article", "description": "As far as Georgia is concerned, the most important vote in Congress last week wasn\u2019t the one that formally ended a 16-day shutdown of the federal government.", "title": "The GOP race for Senate: Angry Birds vs. an adult in the room?"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "ajc", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.ajc.com/weblogs/political-insider/2013/oct/19/gop-race-senate-angry-birds-vs-adult-room/"}, "cmg_revpath": "/re/302/81787/weblogs/political-insider/2013/oct/19/gop-race-senate-angry-birds-vs-adult-room/", "keywords": "saxby chambliss,political insider blog,johnny isakson,federal shutdown,Phil Gingrey,Paul Broun,Karen Handel,Jack Kingston,David Perdue", "viewport": "width=1024"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1758\"", "article_summary": "So did David Perdue, a former Dollar General chief executive, who has raised more cash than anyone in the GOP race but Kingston.\nIt is clear that the shutdown has complicated the Senate race for those already in Congress.\nJohnny Isakson and Saxby Chambliss briefed most House Republicans from Georgia on the Democrat-heavy Senate compromise that was headed their way.\nAnd the same Chambliss who had declared that, by demanding the moon, House Republicans had stripped their Senate brethren of all realistic negotiating power.\nBut at their meeting, House Republicans from Georgia decided to stick together."}
