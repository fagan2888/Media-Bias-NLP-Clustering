Their reason--\u201cmuch higher prices for health plans.\u201d\n\nThere could be many reasons for this, among them\u2014more people are working and could have received health care benefits; more people have aged into Medicare and no longer need Obamacare as a bridge; more people find high deductibles along with an average 6 percent increase in premiums as too high burden.\n\nRelated: 10 Worst Places to Live for Obamacare\n\nAn analysis by Bloomberg released last week found that premiums for plans sold on the Obamacare exchanges are going to rise by just 6 percent next year. That\u2019s well below the \u201cdouble digit\u201d increases that some insurers had predicted earlier this year. Bloomberg noted that the lower than expected premiums in part were a result of increased insurer competition. Some 77 new insurance providers were added to the marketplace for 2015.\n\nBankrate also found that another reason some current Obamacare enrollees said they wouldn\u2019t enroll in the exchanges again was the website problems they dealt with last year. Still, government officials, for their part, say the federal website has been improved and though it won\u2019t be perfect, it will provide consumers with a better experience than last year.\n\nObamacare\u2019s second open enrollment season begins in just two weeks, and unlike last year\u2019s nightmarish website problems, the biggest challenge could still be getting people to sign up.\n\nThat\u2019s also the conclusion of a survey from the Kaiser Family Foundation, which found that nine out of ten uninsured Americans are unaware that open enrollment for individual plans starts in November. Some two-thirds of uninsured respondents said they know \u201conly a little\u201d or \u201cnothing at all\u201d about the law. More than half of the uninsured people said they had no idea that federal subsidies were available to help make coverage more affordable.\n\nRelated: Four Little Words That Could Kill Obamacare\n\nThis is an alarming finding, since the key goal of the law is to expand coverage to qualified uninsured people. If those people are unaware of the law and its specific provisions to help them afford coverage, then the administration\u2019s outreach efforts may be failing.\n\n\"I think a lot of work needs to be done,\" Kaiser\u2019s Mollyann Brodie, told CNBC. \"We're at the very early stages of the second enrollment period, and right now one of the main target audiences is not primed or focused on it.\"\n\n\n\nYahoo Finance is answering your money questions on Tumblr!
