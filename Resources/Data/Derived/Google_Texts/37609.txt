As news breaks that enrollment has surpassed one million, it turns out one of Obamacare's fiercest critics is among Republicans showing some "secret love" for the law.

Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Florida) signed his family up on the federal healthcare exchange and has opted to take a federal subsidy offered to lawmakers and staff, the Tampa Bay Times reports.

"Senator Rubio spent time looking at all the options and decided to enroll through the D.C. exchange for coverage for him and his family," Rubio's spokeswoman Brooke Sammon told the Times, adding that "Senator Rubio is following the law, even though he opposes it."

The Washington Post notes that Rubio's fellow 2016 GOP presidential prospects Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) have also joined the D.C. exchange.

Rubio has previously tried to kill Obamacare, even declining last March to support a stopgap bill to fund the government unless it also defunded "this Obamacare bill that is going to be an absolute disaster for the American economy."
