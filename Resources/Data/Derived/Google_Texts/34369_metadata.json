Three of those convicted are still serving time while Roberts is out on parole.\n\nThey are seeking post-conviction relief in a civil proceeding in Fairbanks Superior Court that could last a month. If successful, all four could have their convictions overturned, the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner reported (http://is.gd/2cja0g).\n\nThe four are represented by the Alaska Innocence Project, which is relying on the testimony of another man, a California inmate who claims he witnessed other people kill Hartman.\n\nWilliam Z. Holmes Sr., who was a senior at Lathrop High School in Fairbanks in 1997, said he was present when Hartman was fatally beaten by a group of four of his Lathrop classmates. He testified about his memories, and attributed some quotes to a friend over the objections of state prosecutors, who said that was hearsay.\n\nThe judge, Paul Lyle, said he would decide later whether the attributed quotes would be allowed into evidence.\n\nProsecutor Adrienne Bachman noted in her opening statements that this is not a trial. She said the four men already have had fair trials and appeals.\n\nThe idea of redoing the trials \u201coffends the sensibilities that we all have about the 36 citizens who exercised their (jury) duty,\u201d she said.\n\nShe said she plans to reinforce the validity of the trials. Bachman also said the state stands behind police work comparing a boot to a face wound and interrogations that produced confessions from Vent and Frese. Those were later recanted.\n\nBachman also plans to introduce new evidence from a cabdriver, who later told Alaska State Troopers he saw either \u201cNative\u201d or \u201cAsian\u201d men - including one with Pease\u2019s distinctive ponytail hair style - near the corner where Hartman was beaten.\n\nSupporters of the four held a rally outside the courthouse during the lunch break.\n\nAdvocate Shirley Lee addressed the crowd, responding to Bachman\u2019s arguments.\n\n\u201cShe wants us to assume that the juries that convicted our four young men were provided evidence beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d she said. \u201cWe know that that is not so. Those convictions were based on a foundation of sand that will wash away when all the truth is presented.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Four men who claim they were wrongly convicted of killing a Fairbanks teenager in 1997 are seeking post-conviction relief in a civil trial that started Monday.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Four men who claim they were wrongly convicted of killing a Fairbanks teenager in 1997 are seeking post-conviction relief in a civil trial that started Monday.", "title": "\u2018Fairbanks Four\u2019 wants convictions overturned", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/oct/5/fairbanks-four-wants-convictions-overturned/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/10/05/ae53f504e6a7002c840f6a7067009c86.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/10/05/ae53f504e6a7002c840f6a7067009c86.jpg", "description": "Four men who claim they were wrongly convicted of killing a Fairbanks teenager in 1997 are seeking post-conviction relief in a civil trial that started Monday.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "\u2018Fairbanks Four\u2019 wants convictions overturned"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda739\"", "article_summary": "If successful, all four could have their convictions overturned, the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner reported (http://is.gd/2cja0g).\nFAIRBANKS, Alaska (AP) - Four men who claim they were wrongly convicted of killing a Fairbanks teenager in 1997 are seeking post-conviction relief in a civil trial that started Monday.\nThey are seeking post-conviction relief in a civil proceeding in Fairbanks Superior Court that could last a month.\n\u201cShe wants us to assume that the juries that convicted our four young men were provided evidence beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d she said.\nThe so-called Fairbanks Four - George Frese, Kevin Pease, Marvin Roberts and Eugene Vent - were sentenced in the death 18 years ago of John Hartman."}
