Individuals and families can purchase non-group coverage through exchanges, in many cases with federal tax credits.\n\nUnitedHealth Group has been a small player in the individual market, with about 795,000 enrollees this year in policies sold through exchanges. But competition among health insurers on the exchanges is key to controlling costs.\n\n\u201cThis quarter, with the majority of our 2016 exchange members new to us, we have been appropriately cautious in our reserve estimates, reflecting an additional $125 million in full-year 2016 exchange losses,\u201d David Wichmann, the company's chief financial officer, said during Tuesday's conference call. \u201cThese were fully absorbed in this quarter and fully considered for the year in our guidance range, and we do not anticipate financial exposure from exchanges in 2017.\u201d\n\nUnitedHealth raised its financial guidance for 2016 after reporting first-quarter earnings Tuesday that beat analyst expectations.\n\nThe company posted $1.61 billion in net earnings on $44.5 billion in revenue. During the same period last year, UnitedHealth Group reported net earnings of $1.41 billion on $35.8 billion in revenue.\n\nAdjusted earnings came in at $1.81 a share, better than the $1.72 result that was the average forecast of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters.\n\nMembership in the company's U.S. health insurance plans grew to 43.6 million people at the end of March from 42.3 million people at the end of 2015.\n\nBased on the results and trends, UnitedHealth Group said it expects 2016 revenue of approximately $182 billion and adjusted net earnings in a range of $7.75 to $7.95 a share. The increase of 15 cents in the outlook for adjusted net earnings per share stems from changes in the expected income tax rate and intangible amortization.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://triblive.com/csp/mediapool/sites/dt.common.streams.StreamServer.cls?STREAMOID=F79_L_KJ_dfrkdbNPezNDc$daE2N3K4ZzOUsqbU5sYtmtCaMUZ8BtYPBH1EZVyCtWCsjLu883Ygn4B49Lvm9bPe2QeMKQdVeZmXF$9l$4uCZ8QDXhaHEp3rvzXRJFdy0KqPHLoMevcTLo3h8xh70Y6N_U_CryOsw6FTOdKL_jpQ-&CONTENTTYPE=image/jpeg", "sailthru.author": "Star Tribune (Minneapolis)", "description": "MINNEAPOLIS \u2014 UnitedHealth Group will operate in only a ''handful'' of new health insurance exchanges in 2017, the company's chief executive said Tuesday, down from ...", "pubdate": "2016-04-19 23:00:01", "author": "Star Tribune (Minneapolis)", "og": {"site_name": "TribLIVE.com", "description": "MINNEAPOLIS \u2014 UnitedHealth Group will operate in only a ''handful'' of new health insurance exchanges in 2017, the company's chief executive said Tuesday, down from ...", "title": "UnitedHealth steps up pullout of Obamacare exchanges", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://triblive.com/csp/mediapool/sites/dt.common.streams.StreamServer.cls?STREAMOID=F79_L_KJ_dfrkdbNPezNDc$daE2N3K4ZzOUsqbU5sYtmtCaMUZ8BtYPBH1EZVyCtWCsjLu883Ygn4B49Lvm9bPe2QeMKQdVeZmXF$9l$4uCZ8QDXhaHEp3rvzXRJFdy0KqPHLoMevcTLo3h8xh70Y6N_U_CryOsw6FTOdKL_jpQ-&CONTENTTYPE=image/jpeg", "updated_time": "2016-04-19 23:24:06.367", "url": "http://triblive.com/business/headlines/10334852-74/unitedhealth-exchanges-2017", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"description": "MINNEAPOLIS \u2014 UnitedHealth Group will operate in only a ''handful'' of new health insurance exchanges in 2017, the company's chief executive said Tuesday, down from ...", "creator": "@triblive", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "tribbird://", "iphone": "tribbird://"}, "name": {"ipad": "TribLIVE News and Sports", "iphone": "TribLIVE News and Sports"}, "id": {"ipad": 328217517, "iphone": 328217517}}, "title": "UnitedHealth steps up pullout of Obamacare exchanges", "site": {"identifier": "@triblive", "id": 20269833}, "image": "http://triblive.com/csp/mediapool/sites/dt.common.streams.StreamServer.cls?STREAMOID=F79_L_KJ_dfrkdbNPezNDc$daE2N3K4ZzOUsqbU5sYtmtCaMUZ8BtYPBH1EZVyCtWCsjLu883Ygn4B49Lvm9bPe2QeMKQdVeZmXF$9l$4uCZ8QDXhaHEp3rvzXRJFdy0KqPHLoMevcTLo3h8xh70Y6N_U_CryOsw6FTOdKL_jpQ-&CONTENTTYPE=image/jpeg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2016-04-19 23:00:01", "fb": {"app_id": 144410955752326}, "sailthru.title": "UnitedHealth steps up pullout of Obamacare exchanges", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=328217517", "sailthru.canonical": "http://triblive.com/business/headlines/10334852-74/unitedhealth-exchanges-2017", "keywords": "unitedhealth, exchanges, group, 2017, earnings", "headline": "UnitedHealth steps up pullout of Obamacare exchanges", "sailthru.tags": "Newsletter, News, Wire Stories", "article": {"category": "Business", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/triblive", "published_time": "2016-04-19 23:00:01", "subcategory": "Headlines", "mainsection": "News", "section": "News", "publishedtoweb": "2016-04-19 23:00:01", "modified_time": "2016-04-19 23:24:06.367", "tag": "unitedhealth, exchanges, group, 2017, earnings", "subsection": "Headlines", "title": "UnitedHealth steps up pullout of Obamacare exchanges", "author": "Star Tribune (Minneapolis)"}, "docauthor": "Star Tribune (Minneapolis)", "sailthru.description": "MINNEAPOLIS \u2014 UnitedHealth Group will operate in only a ''handful'' of new health insurance exchanges in 2017, the company's chief executive said Tuesday, down from ..."}, "article_summary": "UnitedHealth Group competes on exchanges in 34 states, but has confirmed exits for 2017 in only a handful of them.\nUnitedHealth steps up pullout of Obamacare exchangesEmail Newsletters Sign up for one of our email newsletters.\nDuring the same period last year, UnitedHealth Group reported net earnings of $1.41 billion on $35.8 billion in revenue.\nUnitedHealth Group has been a small player in the individual market, with about 795,000 enrollees this year in policies sold through exchanges.\nMINNEAPOLIS \u2014 UnitedHealth Group will operate in only a \u201chandful\u201d of new health insurance exchanges in 2017, the company's chief executive said Tuesday, down from more than 30 states this year."}
