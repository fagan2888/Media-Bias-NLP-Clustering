He also happens to be running for president and is adamantly pro-life. Today at the National Right to Life (NRLC) Convention he shared about his work and how it\u2019s affected his pro-life beliefs.\n\nHe said, \u201cThere are few things I like to talk about more than life. My whole career has been about that. There is nothing that you have that is more valuable than your life.\u201d\n\nHe explained that this is exactly why he\u2019s against Obamacare because it gives bureaucrats the power to do they want with health care.\n\nDr. Carson said, \u201cAmerica was designed around the people, with the government to facilitate life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. With the Affordable Care Act, the government comes along and says \u2018We don\u2019t care what you the people think.\u2019 It turns the whole concept of America on it\u2019s head and if we continue to accept it, where else will it go? It\u2019s up to us the people to stand up for what we believe in.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Carson explained that he performed the first ever successful intrauterine surgery on a unborn baby who had Hydrocephalus, which causes a baby to accumulate fluid around the brain. He was amazed when he inserted a shunt and saw the baby\u2019s head shrink on the ultrasound. Remarkably, the baby survived and later he mentioned that many pro-abortion physicians would have advised the mother to abort that child rather than save its life through surgery.\n\nDr. Carson stressed that technology and education can change the face of the pro-life movement. He said, \u201cIt\u2019s hard to keep people in the dark with the technology that exists today and we have to continue to make that available to everybody because it\u2019s education that\u2019s going to save us. Our founders said that our society and liberties are based on well informed and an educated populous. Why? Because they realized that people who are uneducated are easy to manipulate.\u201d\n\nDr. Carson is correct; medical technology is one of the reasons the pro-life movement is thriving today. For example, countless babies are saved every year thanks to ultrasounds, which can show the baby in utero in incredible detail. In fact, statistics show that 78% of pregnant women who see an ultrasound of their baby reject abortion.\n\nKeep up with the latest pro-life news and information on Twitter.

He said, \u201cWe have a government that believes we aren\u2019t a Judeo-Christian nation. But they don\u2019t get to decide that, we get to decide that.\u201d\n\nAs LifeNews previously reported, in 2013, Dr. Carson shared what he believes about the supposed \u201cwar on women\u201d at the Voters Value Summit. He said, \u201cYou know, there are those of us in this society who have told women that there\u2019s a war on them because that cute little baby inside of them, they may want to get rid of it and there are people that are keeping you from doing that,\u201d\n\nCarson continued. \u201cAnd women say, \u2018No, no, they\u2019re not doing that to me! No!\u2019 And they get all riled up.\u201d He continued, \u201cThere is no war on them, the war is on their babies, Babies that cannot defend themselves. Over the past few decades, we have destroyed 55 million of them. And we have the nerve to call other societies of the past heathen. What we need to do is re-educate the women to understand that they are the defenders of these babies.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ben Carson: Government Doesn't Get to Decide if We are a Pro-Life Nation, We Do", "og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "Dr. Ben Carson is a brain surgeon who has written eight books including a few New York Times best sellers about his work in medicine.
