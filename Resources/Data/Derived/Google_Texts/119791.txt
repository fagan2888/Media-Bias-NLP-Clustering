The Medical Loss Ratio (MLR) provision of the Affordable Care Act is “working the way we hoped it would,” Sen. John D. Rockefeller IV, D-W. Va., said today at a contentious Senate hearing during which Republicans challenged aspects of the law.

“The minimum medical loss ratio is a very simple idea, but it appears to have had a powerful, and very positive, effect on the health insurance market,” Rockefeller said at the hearing of the Commerce, Science & Transportation Committee he chairs.
