Boston prosecutors have dropped a slew of charges against a man who was arrested Friday after he boarded a city bus wearing a fake bullet belt — a garment popular in the punk and metal music scenes.

Kevin Young, 26, appeared in Brighton District Court on charges of unlawful possession of ammunition, unlawfully carried dangerous weapon and disorderly conduct, a local CBS affiliate reported.

The charges were dismissed after prosecutors determined the ammunition “could not and weren’t intended to be fired,” a spokesman at the Suffolk County District Attorney’s Office said Monday.

Boston police said they received several 911 calls from terrified passengers who thought Mr. Young was a terrorist.

“The driver stated that the passengers were in a panic, fearing that the suspect was about to pull out a weapon,” Boston police said.

Officers recovered 69 replica bullets in all. The suspect was wearing what was described as spiked fighting gloves and spiked leather bracelets.

Digital music magazine Vanyaland reported that Mr. Young may be a member of the band Hexxus, described as “Heavy Crust // D-Beat Destruction” on Facebook.
