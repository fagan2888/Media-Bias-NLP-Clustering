Home plan for May 17, 2015

This ranch-style home boasting Craftsman details uses modest square footage very wisely. The open plan feels larger than you’d expect, thanks to a vaulted ceiling throughout and the great room’s wall of windows that pulls you from the foyer into the living space. The kitchen features a breakfast bar that overlooks the main living area and opens to the casual dining room in back. A private bathroom is attached to the master suite, while two more bedrooms have use of the full hall bath. The three-car garage, an unusual amenity for a home of this size, is broken up visually by stone so that it doesn’t dominate the charming exterior.
