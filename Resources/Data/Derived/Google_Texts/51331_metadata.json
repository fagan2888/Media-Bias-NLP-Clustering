The building, which once housed a brothel among other unsavory businesses, was purchased by the America Legion in 1928 to honor World War I general John \"Black Jack\" Pershing and his troops. The U.S. government acquired the property in the 1930s after years of neglect and in 1991 transferred authority for the site to the VA, which almost immediately started looking for ways to sell the place.\n\nRelated: The VA and Pentagon Take a Small \u2013 but Very Expensive \u2013 Step on Medical Records\n\nThe agency found a solution in 1998 when it signed a 99-year-lease with a French firm. The extraordinarily long lease, due to expire in 2097, was required under French law so the firm could invest millions to renovate the building, eventually turning it into a fancy little hotel a few blocks from the Seine.\n\nAs the VA works to recover from last year\u2019s scandal over mismanaged healthcare and regain trust on Capitol Hill, Rep. Mike Coffman (R-CO), who chairs a House Veterans\u2019 Affairs Committee subpanel, plans to introduce a bill that would allow the department to divest itself of Pershing Hall and funnel the money toward domestic construction projects.\n\n\u201cManaging property leases in Europe is not a core-competency of the Department of Veterans Affairs,\u201d Coffman, a Marine Corps veteran, said Wednesday in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous that construction projects in Colorado and elsewhere remain unfunded while VA keeps a ritzy Parisian hotel on its books.\u201d\n\nHow much VA would actually get for the property is unclear, since most of the price estimates were done before the building was rehabbed. In 1990 agency officials estimated the value between $80 and $100 million. In 1993 the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office assumed the department could sell it for about $14 million.\n\nRelated: The VA\u2019s Last, Best Chance to Salvage Its Health Care System\n\nCoffman\u2019s legislation, which he plans to introduce with three Democratic cosponsors after ironing out kinks with the VA and the American Legion, would require the department to pick a non-department entity such as the General Services Administration or a private real estate firm to conduct an assessment of the property\u2019s value.\n\nThe department received two initial fixed payments from the lease: $533,000 in 1998 and $467,000 in 2000. The lease also calls for payment of periodic rent of 800,000 French francs between 2001 and 2014, and 1.2 million francs between 2014 and 2097; presumably those payments would be converted to euros, which France adopted in 1999.\n\nAny proceeds from the sale would be placed in the VA\u2019s construction coffers. Those accounts have come under intense scrutiny in the last year, especially after the department announced earlier this year it would cost around $1.7 billion to build a replacement hospital in a Denver suburb, more than five times the facility\u2019s original $328 million price tag.\n\nRelated: Still Mired in Scandal, VA Awards $142 Million in Bonuses\n\nCongress found a way to pay for the 184-bed facility in September, so any money from selling Pershing Hall would go to other projects.\n\nInfluential veterans service organizations such as the Veterans of Foreign Wars and even the VA itself support Coffman\u2019s idea.\n\n\u201cThe VFW believes that VA should not be on the hotel business, but disposal of the hotel should be a business decision and not just an effort to no longer own the building,\u201d Raymond Kelley, the group\u2019s legislative director, said earlier this week during a House VA hearing.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Congress thinks it\u2019s time the scandal-plagued Veterans Affairs Department got out of the Parisian luxury hotel business.", "title": "Why Does the VA Own a 5-Star Luxury Hotel in Paris?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/10/Why-Does-VA-Own-5-Star-Luxury-Hotel-Paris", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/12102015_Pershing-Hall.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/10/Why-Does-VA-Own-5-Star-Luxury-Hotel-Paris", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/12102015_Pershing-Hall.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Congress thinks it\u2019s time the scandal-plagued Veterans Affairs Department got out of the Parisian luxury hotel business.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Pershing Hall is a five-star boutique hotel in the heart of Paris, where rooms cost $500 to $900 a night.\nCongress thinks it\u2019s time the scandal-plagued Department of Veterans Affairs got out of the Parisian luxury hotel business.\nInfluential veterans service organizations such as the Veterans of Foreign Wars and even the VA itself support Coffman\u2019s idea.\nRelated: Still Mired in Scandal, VA Awards $142 Million in BonusesCongress found a way to pay for the 184-bed facility in September, so any money from selling Pershing Hall would go to other projects.\n\u201cManaging property leases in Europe is not a core-competency of the Department of Veterans Affairs,\u201d Coffman, a Marine Corps veteran, said Wednesday in a statement."}
