A new analysis focuses on both a result and symptom of this ailing system that helps put it into perspective.\n\nAccording to the American Action Forum, Americans complete more than 23,000 forms for 68 federal agencies each year. Just filling out all these forms consumes 11.4 billion hours, which works out to about 35 hours per person \u2014 almost a full work week.\n\nThe biggest offender, by a large margin, was the Health and Human Services Department, with 5,005 forms, including 943 forms related to the Affordable Care Act. That was 34 percent more than the next agency, the Agriculture Department, with more than 3,700 forms. This includes 334 forms for vegetables and specialty crops, which is more than the total number of crops actually sold in the country (222), AAF noted. There are even forms for \u201cnominations to the Vidalia Onion Committee, nominations to the Hazelnut Marketing Board, a report for \u2018High Moisture Content Prunes\u2019 and an application to ship Florida tomatoes for relief or charity.\u201d The Commerce Department came in third with more than 2,000 forms.\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, the Treasury Department, home to the Internal Revenue Service, came in only fourth with 1,599 forms \u2014 1,053 related to the tax code. These forms imposed far and away the greatest time burden, however, accounting for 77 percent of the total, \u201cthanks in large part to the incomprehensible individual and corporate tax system in the U.S.,\u201d AAF added.\n\nAs if the sheer number of forms were not inconvenient enough, more than 1,400 Agriculture forms, more than 1,000 Treasury forms and nearly 450 HHS forms cannot be submitted online, AAF found. \u201cIn the year 2016, it\u2019s discouraging that such a large percentage (28 percent [for these three agencies]) of supposedly vital private information must be mailed back to the federal government,\u201d it maintained.\n\nWhile some forms are necessary to apply for certain programs, verify eligibility and make sure people are who they say they are, the amount of paperwork imposed on the public has clearly gotten out of hand \u2014 as has the amount of government regulation in general.\n\n\u201cThe number of federal forms, 23,000, should give pause to regulators seeking to add more to the pile or to members of Congress wanting to cede additional power to the executive branch,\u201d AAF concluded.\n\nTo address this burden, AAF recommends adopting a \u201cpaperwork budget,\u201d which would set restrictive limits on the hours of paperwork each agency imposes on citizens every year. This might be helpful, assuming the government implements it in a way that removes more bureaucracy than it adds, which is far from a sure thing. An even better solution would be to simply reduce the size and scope of government.\n\nThe thought of filling out endless forms to provide personal information, file income taxes and apply for countless government programs would have been inconceivable to our nation\u2019s founders. It should shock the conscience still today.", "article_metadata": {"description": "There is no denying that the federal government suffers from a tremendous amount of waste, bureaucratic bloat and excessive regulation.
