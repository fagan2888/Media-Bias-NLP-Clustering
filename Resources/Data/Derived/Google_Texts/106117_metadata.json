( Sarah Rose / Daily Record )\n\nA horse stands in Jack Wright's barn on Friday. Wright said the horses he has trained have received about 30 world and reserve titles since the late 1980s. (Sarah Rose / Daily Record)\n\nPenrose \u2014 A Penrose man is the trainer of the current top two lifetime leading performance stallions in the world.\n\nTru Rolex has been the leading horse for several years, and Gay Bar Drummer became No. 2 last year, said Jack Wright's wife, Holly.\n\nThe Paint Horses received the honors after accumulating points from various shows.\n\nWright said he has received a total of about 30 world and reserve titles since he started showing horses in the late 1980s.\n\nIn November at the 2014 APHA World Championship Paint Horse Show in Forth Worth, Texas, Wright added to his collection of awards. The titles included the high point all around horse, high point all around reserve, the high point western horse, the high point exhibitor award and more.\n\n\"I also won five world titles and two or three reserves,\" Wright said. \"That was in each event. We do the tie down roping, calf roping, the head and heeling steer stopping and then I was in the working cow horse and the reigning.\"\n\nAt the event, he received $500 cash, a custom trophy, saddle pad, accessory tote, splint boots, bell boots, accessory tote and a bridle bag.\n\nHe said his favorite part of show business is training the horses.\n\n\"My biggest thing is finding a job the horse likes,\" Wright said. \"If he doesn't like his job, he isn't going to be very good at it. I consider a horse like a person. Each person is different, every horse is, too.\"\n\nOn average, it takes one to two years to get a horse ready to compete, he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWright said some horses require training every day, while others need less.\n\n\"It just depends how hard they try and their ability to do it,\" he said.\n\nThe 53-year-old said he has been showing horses for more than half of his life.\n\n\"My high school sweetheart kinda got me into it,\" Wright said. \"She had been showing a little bit before she met me, and I kind of just followed the pursuit of it. It ended up growing into a great thing.\"\n\nHe said his relationship with Christ has helped him succeed.\n\nSarah Rose: 719-285-5157, roses@canoncitydailyrecord.com or twitter.com/sarahfaithrose", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/ci_27256770/penrose-man-has-garnered-30-world-reserve-titles", "modificationDate": "2015-01-04T21:07:52-0700", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2015/0104/20150104__05DRPENROSEw~1_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Sarah Rose \n \n  The Daily Record", "description": "Penrose \u2014 A Penrose man is the trainer of the current top two lifetime leading performance stallions in the world.", "ag": {"canon": "CanonCityDailyRecord:article:27256770:view"}, "startDate": "2015-01-04T21:07:10-0700", "og": {"url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/ci_27256770/penrose-man-has-garnered-30-world-reserve-titles", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2015/0104/20150104__05DRPENROSEw~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Penrose \u2014 A Penrose man is the trainer of the current top two lifetime leading performance stallions in the world.", "title": "Penrose man has garnered 30 world, reserve titles showing horses"}, "twitter": {"domain": "canoncitydailyrecord.com", "description": "Penrose \u2014 A Penrose man is the trainer of the current top two lifetime leading performance stallions in the world.", "title": "Penrose man has garnered 30 world, reserve titles showing horses", "url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/ci_27256770/penrose-man-has-garnered-30-world-reserve-titles", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2015/0104/20150104__05DRPENROSEw~1.jpg", "site": "@CCDR_news", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-01-04T21:07:10-0700", "sailthru.site": "canoncitydailyrecord.com", "endDate": "2025-01-04T15:06:04-0700", "sailthru.title": "Penrose man has garnered 30 world, reserve titles showing horses", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Canon City Breaking News, Sports, Weather, Traffic", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "oCjqPZ-ii-IZW-fBJ0mmX5dmH5aafePG3FLx_kSYFiA", "byline": "By Sarah RoseThe", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2015/0104/20150104__05DRPENROSEw~1.jpg", "pubDate": "2015-01-04T21:08:38-0700", "news_keywords": "Canon City news, Colorado news, world news, national news, local news, business news, sports news, entertainment news, us news, Canon City Daily Record"}, "article_summary": "The titles included the high point all around horse, high point all around reserve, the high point western horse, the high point exhibitor award and more.\nWright said he has received a total of about 30 world and reserve titles since he started showing horses in the late 1980s.\nWright said the horses he has trained have received about 30 world and reserve titles since the late 1980s.\nThe 53-year-old said he has been showing horses for more than half of his life.\nThe Paint Horses received the honors after accumulating points from various shows."}
