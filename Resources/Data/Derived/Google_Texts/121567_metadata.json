It\u2019s believed to be the first exhibition of the entire 435-page portfolio at once.\n\nPrinted from 1826 through 1838, the museum\u2019s portfolio was one of roughly 180 published. With little formal artistic or scientific training, Audubon revolutionized nature art by illustrating birds in their natural habitat. \u201cThe Birds of America\u201d remains a standard for modern wildlife imagery.\n\n\u201cHe had a great sense of composition. He also really was one of the first American artists to introduce the concept of landscape and figure in the some composition, showing living entities in their natural environment,\u201d said Joel Oppenheimer, an Audubon print specialist.\n\nWILD TURKEY\n\nHistoryMiami displays \u201cThe Birds of America\u201d in the order they were printed, starting with a wild turkey, its blue head cocked over golden and speckled feathers as it struts through a dense woodland scene.\n\nBenjamin Franklin advocated for the turkey as the national bird, instead of the bald eagle, and Audubon apparently agreed with him, said Rebecca Smith, the museum\u2019s head of special collections and the exhibit\u2019s curator.\n\nAudubon was born in Haiti, then a French colony, and he began studying and drawing birds after arriving in the U.S. in 1803. He became a naturalized citizen in 1812.\n\n\u201cHe wanted to pick, as his first bird, something very American. He was proud of being a U.S. citizen,\u201d Smith said.\n\nPASSENGER PIGEON\n\nOn another 39-inch-by-49-inch print, a bright blue-and-pink passenger pigeon courts its drab-colored mate by sharing food with its black beak. Once the most abundant bird in North America \u2014 migrating flocks would take hours to pass overhead \u2014 it was driven to extinction by the early 1900s by overhunting and habitat destruction.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u2018The Birds of America\u2019 take flight in HistoryMiami exhibit", "title": "\u2018The Birds of America\u2019 take flight in HistoryMiami exhibit", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "\u2018The Birds of America\u2019 take flight in HistoryMiami exhibit", "title": "\u2018The Birds of America\u2019 take flight in HistoryMiami exhibit", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/21/the_birds_of_america_take_flight_in_historymiami_exhibit/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/audubon-bird-prints.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\u2018The Birds of America\u2019 take flight in HistoryMiami exhibit", "title": "\u2018The Birds of America\u2019 take flight in HistoryMiami exhibit", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/audubon-bird-prints.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jennifer Kay", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbaa1\"", "article_summary": "A new HistoryMiami exhibit showing every image printed for Audubon\u2019s masterpiece, \u201cThe Birds of America,\u201d evokes the same feeling of fresh abundance as hundreds of birds swoop, feed and preen across the gallery\u2019s rainbow-hued walls.\n\u201cThe Birds of America\u201d remains a standard for modern wildlife imagery.\nWith little formal artistic or scientific training, Audubon revolutionized nature art by illustrating birds in their natural habitat.\nAudubon was born in Haiti, then a French colony, and he began studying and drawing birds after arriving in the U.S. in 1803.\nPASSENGER PIGEONOn another 39-inch-by-49-inch print, a bright blue-and-pink passenger pigeon courts its drab-colored mate by sharing food with its black beak."}
