For example, those who have traveled to any of the four countries \u2014 Iran, Iraq, Sudan, or Syria \u2014 for government business, on behalf of a humanitarian non-governmental organization, or as a journalist could be allowed visa waivers.\n\nAnd the business exception applies to not only travelers to Iran, but also Iraq.\n\nYet the timing of the announced changes \u2014 and the exceptions allowed \u2014 prompted Republicans to allege the Obama administration was trying to accommodate Iran so as not to undermine the recently-implemented nuclear deal.\n\n\u201cThe Obama administration is blatantly breaking the law, a law the president himself signed,\u201d House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul, R-Texas, and Rep. Candice Miller,R-Mich., said in a joint statement on Thursday.\n\n\u201cPresident Obama is again putting his relationship with Iran\u2019s supreme leader over the security of Americans,\u201d they added. \u201cHe cannot rewrite the law to appease foreign governments \u2014 he should instead pay attention to his own.\u201d\n\nWhen the Iranian government first heard last month about the new visa law approved by Congress, officials accused the U.S. of violating the nuclear deal.\n\nThe Tasnim News Agency quoted Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif as saying that \u201cshould the new law that tightens visa-free travel to the U.S. come into force, it would be tantamount to a breach of the July nuclear deal.\u201d\n\nIn a letter to Zarif the day after Obama signed the law, Secretary of State John Kerry reassured the Iranians that the administration could use executive authority to limit the restrictions for visitors of Iran.\n\nThe nuclear deal was officially implemented this past weekend after Iran fulfilled the terms of the agreement.\n\nRepublican lawmakers characterized Thursday\u2019s announcement confirming the easing of restrictions against travelers to Iran as a political decision meant to assuage the fears of a country it partnered with on the nuclear deal.\n\n\u201cAfter the barbaric acts of violence in Paris and San Bernadino, there should be no hesitation in closing loopholes in the U.S. visa system to keep terrorists from coming into our country,\u201d said Rep. Mike Pompeo, R-Kan., in a statement. \u201cBut instead, DHS [Department of Homeland Security] has announced dangerous changes to our nation\u2019s visa waiver program that prioritize the business interests of Iran \u2013 the world\u2019s largest state sponsor of terrorism \u2013 over the safety of the American people.\u201d\n\nThe visa waiver program was established in 1986 as a way to encourage easy business and tourist travel from overseas to boost the economy domestically. The program allows 20 million each year to enter the U.S. without a visa.\n\nWhile those seeking a traditional visa have to be interviewed in person at an American embassy abroad, the visa waiver program does not require a face-to-face interview. Visa waiver visitors remain subject to strict security and screening requirements.\n\nCritics of the visa waiver restrictions say the new rules could lead to European countries taking reciprocal action, making it more difficult for American travelers.\n\nIn addition, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has criticized the changes applied to dual-nationals, who are both citizens of a visa waiver country and one of the four targeted countries, as discriminatory.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republican lawmakers are angry the White House granted an exception to changes to the visa waiver program for those who've travelled to Iran for business.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Republican lawmakers are angry the White House granted an exception to changes to the visa waiver program for those who've travelled to Iran for business.", "title": "Republicans Mad Over Iran Exception in Visa Waiver Changes", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/IranVisaWaiver.png", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1nqT6UT"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Republican lawmakers are angry the White House granted an exception to changes to the visa waiver program for those who've travelled to Iran for business.", "title": "Republicans Mad Over Iran Exception in Visa Waiver Changes", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/IranVisaWaiver.png"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "International", "tag": "middle east", "published_time": "2016-01-22T16:53:34+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "visa waiver program, terrorism, San Bernardino, Syria, Iraq, Iran, nuclear deal, Homeland Security, John Kerry, Mike Pompeo"}, "article_summary": "While those seeking a traditional visa have to be interviewed in person at an American embassy abroad, the visa waiver program does not require a face-to-face interview.\nCritics of the visa waiver restrictions say the new rules could lead to European countries taking reciprocal action, making it more difficult for American travelers.\nVisa waiver visitors remain subject to strict security and screening requirements.\nThe changes approved by Congress last month was meant as a response to fears that the visa waiver program could allow European nationals connected with the Islamic State, or ISIS, to come to the U.S.\nThe law approved by Congress contains special restrictions on residents of the 38 visa waiver countries \u2014 which are mostly in Europe \u2014 who have connections to Iran, Iraq, Sudan, and Syria, places considered hotbeds for terrorism."}
