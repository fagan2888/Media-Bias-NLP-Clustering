Byrne easily topped Democrat Burton LeFlore during the December 2013 general election.\n\n\"The entire nation knows that Bradley Byrne is an establishment Republican,\" said Young, an Orange Beach developer.\n\nYoung's latest TV spots, which are mostly paid for out of his own pocket, offer highlights from national news shows such as MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" and \"Hardball\" with the phrase \"Bradley Byrne is the establishment Republican\" edited throughout.\n\nThe segments were taken in 2013 ahead of the GOP runoff, which garnered extensive national coverage revolving around a narrative that Bryne was the Republican candidate supported by pro-industry groups such as the Chamber of Commerce while Young was the tea party darling.\n\nThus far, the 2016 rematch has generated little, if any, national press.\n\n'Desperate attack'\n\nYoung, at the conclusion of the latest ad, encourages voters who would support Cruz, Donald Trump, Marco Rubio or Ben Carson for president to support him for Congress.\n\nByrne, on Thursday, said his supporters includes those backing a range of GOP presidential candidates.\n\nRegarding Cruz, Byrne said the Texas senator \u2013 a tea party favorite \u2013 contacted him about making brief remarks ahead of a pre-Christmas rally at the Daphne Civic Center. Cruz is the only GOP presidential candidate to make a stop in Baldwin County \u2013 the home county of both Byrne and Young \u2013 since the campaign began last year.\n\n\"We were together at his request, not mine,\" Byrne said about Cruz. \"I'm glad he was coming into the district. I welcome all these presidential candidates here. I have lots of supporters in the camps in the race.\" He said of Young's ad: \"It's another desperate attack on his part to get some voters to pay attention to him.\"\n\nYoung said Byrne is \"nothing like Ted Cruz and everybody knows it.\" He said, \"This is just another weak attempt to mislead the people of south Alabama.\"\n\nYoung, when he last ran in 2013, fashioned himself as a Ted Cruz congressman and vowed to be among the most conservative congressmen in the country.\n\nCruz is perhaps most well-known for his efforts in leading a government shutdown. Young said in 2013, \"If you guys send me to Congress, it will be like sending Ted Cruz to Washington.\"\n\nAn AL.com report before the November 2013 election showed that Ending Spending PAC, which was a big supporter of Cruz's 2012 Senate victory, contributed $100,000 on a pro-Byrne media spot.\n\nBrian Baker, the head of the PAC, told AL.com at the time: \"It's a great talking point to say you'll be like Ted Cruz. But Ted Cruz is a very smart, a very thoughtful person. And we think Bradley Byrne is better on all of these points.\"\n\n'Completely false'\n\nByrne, meanwhile, is defending his conservative record that has been under attack by Young since November. Among the issues is Planned Parenthood, which Young claims Byrne voted to support.\n\nPlanned Parenthood, which has become a hot button issue in 2016, is the largest single provider of reproductive health services, including abortions, in the U.S.\n\n\"My opponent's ads are filled with falsehoods,\" Byrne said. \"Perhaps the biggest is the any vote I've taken is on Planned Parenthood directly or indirectly.\"\n\nByrne cited his \"zero\" percent rating with the Planned Parenthood, which is the same rating among all Alabama Republicans in the U.S. House.\n\nByrne joined 240 others in the House to vote in support of defunding Planned Parenthood on Sept. 18.\n\nByrne is credited with a 100 percent voting record by the National Right to Life Committee. The committee, Byrne said, would not have given him a 100 percent voting record if he had supported Planned Parenthood funding. \"That's a clear example where my opponent is running ads that are completely false,\" he said.\n\nYoung has also claimed that Byrne voted in support of executive amnesty, something that he claims Cruz as well as Alabama Sens. Jeff Sessions and Richard Shelby oppose.\n\nYoung, on his campaign's website, highlighted instances in which Byrne voted for pro-Obama initiatives including a 2014 federal spending plan that Byrne said at the time was \"good news\" for southwest Alabama because it provided funding for military ships at Mobile's Austal USA shipyard and included measures to restrain domestic spending.\n\nOther Republicans, at the time, voted against the proposal complaining that the $1.1 trillion spending plan failed to take on the president's executive action on immigration or make any attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\n\nByrne, in a March 3 vote, did join other Alabama Republicans to oppose U.S. Department of Homeland Security funding because language stopping executive orders on immigration issued by Obama were stripped out.", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "John Sharp | jsharp@al.com", "medium": "news", "news_keywords": "Bradley Byrne, Ted Cruz, AL01, Dean Young, news", "title": "Ted Cruz's name resurfaces in Bradley Byrne, Dean Young congressional tussle", "og": {"site_name": "AL.com", "description": "In a new campaign TV spot, Dean Young encourages voters who support Ted Cruz, Donald Trump, Marco Rubio and Ben Carson for president to support his run for Congress.
