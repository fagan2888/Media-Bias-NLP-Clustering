A total of 2,251 square miles of forest, an area almost twice the size of Rhode Island, was cleared during the 12 months to August. The rise is thought to be related to new, more relaxed laws for farming in the Amazon.\n\nEven as the Paris summit gets under way, activists are reporting a new major blaze in the Brazilian jungle \u2014 threatening indigenous communities that have lived in harmony with the rainforest since time immemorial, while also releasing huge amounts of carbon into the atmosphere.\n\nPeru, meanwhile, has the second-largest chunk of the Amazon, a stretch of jungle twice the size of California, and is also failing to protect it. Illegal gold miners are starting to encroach on the Tambopata Reserve, one of the country\u2019s best-known natural protected areas.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Global warming and a gold mining boom have devastated the rainforest.
