In July, State Sen. Paul LeVota (D) resigned amid allegations that he sexually harassed two interns. And in May, House Speaker John Diehl (R) \u2014 perhaps the most powerful lawmaker in the state \u2014 stepped down after the Kansas City Star reported that he exchanged sexually explicit text messages with a 19-year-old intern.\n\nIn response, lawmakers are attempting to make changes to the current internship program to provide more oversight. And at least two state legislators \u2014 Reps. Bill Kidd (R) and Nick King (R) \u2014 have thrown their weight behind an intern dress code.\n\n\u201cWe need a good, modest, conservative dress code for both the males and females,\u201d King wrote in an email to the rest of his colleagues after Kidd made the initial suggestion. \u201cRemoving one more distraction will help everyone keep their focus on legislative matters.\u201d\n\nThe idea was met with derision from Kidd and King\u2019s Democratic colleagues, as well as roundly mocked on Twitter. Critics pointed out that changing interns\u2019 dress codes won\u2019t get at the fundamental issue of lawmakers potentially harassing their staff or colleagues. Plus, they argued there isn\u2019t anything inherently distracting about interns\u2019 bodies that should prevent their bosses from being able to go about doing their jobs.\n\n\u201cIf my plaid jacket or the sight of a woman\u2019s bare knee distracts you from your legislative duties, I would look for other work,\u201d Rep. Jeremy LaFaver (D) responded.\n\nMissouri\u2019s legislature isn\u2019t the first to wade into this fight. Last year, Montana lawmakers made national headlines for approving new dress code guidelines that stipulated \u201cleggings are not considered dress pants\u201d and women should be \u201csensitive to skirt lengths and necklines.\u201d Female politicians in the state objected, saying the new rules created \u201cthis ability to scrutinize women\u201d and were \u201ctotally sexist and bizarre and unnecessary.\u201d\n\nThe argument over gender-based dress codes has also spread to middle schools and high schools across the country, as female students push back against the assumption that the way they dress may distract their male peers from concentrating in class. Critics say this approach to dress codes reinforces the idea that women\u2019s bodies are inherently tempting to men and that women are responsible for covering themselves up. The implicit message, then, is that it\u2019s women\u2019s job to change their behavior to prevent men from committing sexual crimes.\n\n\u201cMaybe voters should insist on a special requirement for men applying to be a Missouri lawmaker,\u201d Kansas City Star columnist Yael Abouhalkah wrote on Tuesday. \u201cIt could rule out any men who consider themselves to be lascivious, salacious and simply indecent.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "\u201cRemoving one more distraction will help everyone keep their focus on legislative matters.\u201d", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "\u201cRemoving one more distraction will help everyone keep their focus on legislative matters.\u201d", "title": "Missouri Lawmakers Propose Ending Sexual Harassment By Telling Interns To Dress Modestly", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2015/08/18/3692835/missouri-dress-code-interns/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/18153144/shutterstock_109530893.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\u201cRemoving one more distraction will help everyone keep their focus on legislative matters.\u201d", "title": "Missouri Lawmakers Propose Ending Sexual Harassment By Telling Interns To Dress Modestly", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/18153144/shutterstock_109530893-321x214.jpg", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/18153144/shutterstock_109530893.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/18153144/shutterstock_109530893.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-18T16:08:38+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Health Missouri Lawmakers Propose Ending Sexual Harassment By Telling Interns To Dress Modestly CREDIT: ShutterstockSome Missouri state lawmakers have a controversial idea for preventing future sexual harassment cases in the legislature: Imposing a new \u201cmodest\u201d dress code for teenage interns.\nCritics pointed out that changing interns\u2019 dress codes won\u2019t get at the fundamental issue of lawmakers potentially harassing their staff or colleagues.\nAnd at least two state legislators \u2014 Reps.
