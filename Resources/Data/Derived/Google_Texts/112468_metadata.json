But it\u2019s another Kennedy they should be thanking.\n\nIt was because Ted Kennedy \u201cborked\u201d President Reagan\u2019s first choice for a vacancy on the bench in 1987 that the Left has Justice Kennedy to do its bidding. The Democrat senator led a witch hunt against true conservative Robert Bork, smearing the respected jurist as a right-wing troglodyte.\n\nAfter the Senate rejected Bork, 58-42, Reagan turned to conservative Douglas Ginsburg, who was impeached in the liberal media before he ever got the chance to raise his hand in the Senate. That left a frustrated Reagan with a distant third choice \u2014 a nominal San Francisco conservative who met with enough liberal approval to sail through confirmation.\n\nAnd Anthony McLeod Kennedy didn\u2019t disappoint his Democrat rubber-stampers. Five years later, despite stated pro-life views, he supplied the fifth vote to re-affirm Roe v. Wade.\n\nNow, with his swing vote allowing gay marriage, he\u2019s being embraced as the \u201cfirst gay justice\u201d by the LGBT lobby. And after his fifth vote upholding the \u201cdisparate impact\u201d cudgel that Obama is using to bully home lenders, insurers and zoning authorities into adopting racial quotas, Kennedy\u2019s being hailed by civil-rights activists as \u201cthe man who saved the Fair Housing Act\u201d \u2014 even though the FHA excludes disparate impact and requires actual proof of racial bias.\n\nIt\u2019s a strange dynamic that Kennedy has become an embarrassment to conservatives and a hero to liberals. But it all stems back to the late Kennedy and his hardball tactics. If the liberal senator hadn\u2019t been so successful in \u201cborking\u201d Reagan\u2019s conservative nominees for the Supreme Court, this judicial activist masquerading as a conservative wouldn\u2019t be in the position he\u2019s in.\n\nIn effect, Ted Kennedy is borking America from the grave.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Advice And Consent: Liberals are cheering \"conservative\" Justice Anthony Kennedy for the votes he cast on gay marriage, ObamaCare and minority housing rights.", "og": {"site_name": "Investor's Business Daily", "description": "Advice And Consent: Liberals are cheering \u201cconservative\u201d Justice Anthony Kennedy for the votes he cast on gay marriage, ObamaCare and minority housing rights.
