It's taking the data, organizing it and simplifying it, and then giving it back to the consumer and their health care provider -- their doctor or their nurse -- in order for them to make better health outcome decisions.", "article_metadata": {"publish_time": "09:30", "date": "2014-03-04T14:30:00Z", "description": "UnitedHealth Group sees consumers taking charge and getting better health outcomes.", "ResponsiveALP": "1Ses_control-21_control_100", "author": "Rex Moore", "promo": "UnitedHealth Group sees consumers taking charge and getting better health outcomes.", "twitter": {"site": "@themotleyfool", "description": "UnitedHealth Group sees consumers taking charge and getting better health outcomes.", "title": "From Fitbit to Fit: What to Do with All That Data --  The Motley Fool"}, "pitch": 409, "og": {"site_name": "The Motley Fool", "description": "UnitedHealth Group sees consumers taking charge and getting better health outcomes.", "title": "From Fitbit to Fit: What to Do with All That Data --  The Motley Fool", "url": "http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/03/04/from-fitbit-to-fit-what-to-do-with-all-that-data.aspx", "image": "https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Fassets%2Fimages%2Ffool%2Ftmf-logo.png&h=630&w=1200&op=resize", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 50808187550, "page_id": 7240312795, "app_id": 50808187550}, "bureau": "usmf-health-care", "STORY_UID": "de8596a8-94ec-11e3-b875-0050569d4be0", "headline": "From Fitbit to Fit: What to Do with All That Data", "msvalidate.01": "8D40D58712924715BAA79D135A6C8DDA", "gsa_date": "2014 03 04", "tickers": "UNH", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1c2b\"", "article_summary": "In this video from the 2014 International CES, Tom talks about the role data plays in consumer health.\nSo you've got a Fitbit and you're tracking activity, calories, sleep -- what happens to all that data?\nAs Chief Consumer Officer for UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH), Tom Paul works hard to understand the evolving needs of today's health consumers.\nTom Paul: The other thing that's transformed is, in the past, consumers mainly engaged on health when they were faced with a situation.\nMost people are tracking their activities, they're monitoring their activities through digital and through technology, and all of that continues to generate data."}
