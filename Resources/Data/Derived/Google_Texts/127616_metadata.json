Politics, sure. Just witness all the litigation surrounding the Affordable Care Act. But I\u2019ve never been asked by my editors to think about what the election of a new president might mean for health care.\n\nThis week, two stories presented themselves to me on a silver platter: The keynote speaker at an American Health Lawyers Association conference in Nashville said Hillary Clinton (D) would be the better choice for those concerned about health-care issues, and Donald Trump (R) released a list of potential Supreme Court nominees.\n\nThe speaker, a financial adviser who watches the health-care market closely, said Clinton is the better choice in part because she is a known quantity. She\u2019s on record opposing high drug prices, and she set out her own plan to reform health care in the 1990s. Several people in the audience disagreed, saying you can\u2019t always judge a presidential candidate by policies they expressed 30 years ago. They also disagreed with the speaker\u2019s statement that the Republicans probably will lose the Senate if Trump\u2019s elected\u2014a move that would certainly doom his only announced health-care priority so far, repealing the ACA.\n\nPossible future President Trump, however, probably wouldn\u2019t have to worry about an ACA repeal because his Supreme Court would be stacked with conservative justices likely to overturn key provisions of the act or pull back its implementation. Three of the federal judges have heard cases concerning religious objections to the contraceptive mandate. One of those judges served on the only court to reject the government\u2019s position The Supreme Court recently punted on the issue, sending it back to the appeals courts with directions to the parties to try to find a compromise, so it could come up again.\n\nAnother federal judge sat on a panel that considered a strict abortion informed consent law. His two colleagues upheld two of the law\u2019s provisions, but rejected one that would have required doctors to tell their patients that having an abortion could cause suicidal thoughts. Trump\u2019s potential nominee would have upheld that provision. Although the Supreme Court doesn\u2019t often take abortion cases, conservative justices could push it to take more in the future in an effort to overturn Roe v. Wade.\n\nThe hearts of health-care transactions attorneys may have skipped a beat, however, when they saw the name of Sixth Circuit judge on the list. He took part in a case that has required the unwinding of an Ohio hospital merger.\n\nWhatever your political beliefs, both developments provided food for thought this week.\n\nMy AHLA Health Care Transactions Conference story is at http://www.bna.com/clinton-better-choice-n57982072679/\n\nMy Trump Supreme Court nominee story is at http://www.bna.com/trump-list-court-n57982072730/\n\nStay on top of new developments in health law and regulation with a free trial to the Health Law Resource Center.\n\nLearn more about Bloomberg Law and sign up for a free trial.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.bna.com/vote-hillary-financial-b57982072762/", "image": "http://www.bna.com/uploadedImages/BNA_V2/Company/BnaSocialShare.jpg", "description": "In my many years writing about health care law for Bloomberg BNA, I\u2019ve never written about a presidential...", "title": "Vote for Hillary, Financial Adviser Says, But Trump\u2019s the Man If You Want a Conservative Supreme Court"}, "csrf-token": "kGUVsq5I0s1-vXVctyLRgRGhkJcPulhmtXj84KOj3RzD7-6ft7hDxob7RVsqy2RlQ7C4uOdHGRKRVZgSkZQj6e6A0HzHeH2AXDWrSr9hHq81:7BWUjNqDMiBserjmfDTNWcCmdEqrZQ-cD-DBUo9OnlaE0Bgb3pCFjDiSv6GSS0HatWLzRo7iFXCld5ZfTLnTvIlR7ViaOHJOYfSIrUdyET41", "description": "In my many years writing about health care law for Bloomberg BNA, I\u2019ve never written about a presidential", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fragment": "!"}, "article_summary": "In my many years writing about health care law for Bloomberg BNA, I\u2019ve never written about a presidential election.\nBut I\u2019ve never been asked by my editors to think about what the election of a new president might mean for health care.\nShe\u2019s on record opposing high drug prices, and she set out her own plan to reform health care in the 1990s.\nAlthough the Supreme Court doesn\u2019t often take abortion cases, conservative justices could push it to take more in the future in an effort to overturn Roe v.
