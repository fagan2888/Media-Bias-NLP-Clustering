Browser maker and mobile ad company Opera is acquiring AdColony to bolster its mobile video ad capabilities. AdColony helps marketers place video ads across a network of Apple iOS and Android mobile applications, such as those published by ABC News and A&E Networks.

Opera is paying $75 million in cash for AdColony, plus potential earn-out payments of up to $275 million, Opera said.

According to Mahi de Silva, CEO of Opera’s Mediaworks unit, the purchase reflects his company’s focus on so-called “rich media” and interactive ad experiences, as opposed to mobile banner ads which large brand marketers have never invested heavily in.

“Taking the banner ad and shrinking it 70 percent has not proved a very fruitful experience for consumers or advertisers,” Mr. de Silva explained. “Our customers are asking for better ad units and better inventory, so this is opportunity to better augment our platform,” he added.

There are no shortage of ad networks and brokers offering access to mobile video ads. But AdColony says its major selling point is its “low-latency” ad serving technology. In other words, it’s figured out a way to load video ads quickly, which is especially important when delivering them to mobile devices with relatively slow connections.

“We’ve focussed on eliminating the pain points of mobile advertising,” said AdColony CEO Will Kassoy, who will now additionally take on the role of Chief Marketing Officer of Opera Mediaworks.

Following the acquisition AdColony will operate as a subsidiary of Opera Mediaworks and continue to serve its existing customers, which include both mobile app publishers and major ad agencies.

Meanwhile Opera hopes it can cross sell its ad offerings to AdColony customers. It’ll also help it reach more users.

“This is a scale company that’s coming into Opera. It really helps expand not just our value proposition but also our reach,” Mr. de Silva concluded.
