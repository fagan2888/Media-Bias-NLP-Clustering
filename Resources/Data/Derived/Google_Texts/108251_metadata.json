Rosalie Little Thunder, Lakota, walked on August 9.\n\nVi Waln, in the blog Sicangu Scribe, called Little Thunder \u201cone of our libraries.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was very privileged to have worked with Rosalie on several projects. Her determination to help the Lakota people evolve out of the colonized mindset many have succumbed to was inspirational,\u201d Waln wrote. \u201cA Lakota woman of Rosalie\u2019s caliber is hard to find in today\u2019s modern, assimilated society.\u201d\n\nWaln also pointed out Little Thunder\u2019s involvement in activism. Little Thunder spoke out against the buffalo being slaughtered at Yellowstone National Park and even organized a National Day of Prayer for them. Most recently, Little Thunder was involved with the movement against the Keystone XL pipeline.\n\n\u201cHer legacy is our current history. She was taken to boarding schools, she survived and became a life long peace activist and teacher. She is a descendant of great Lakota Chiefs, and in her own right, was one of our foremost Peace Chiefs of modern times. She will be missed, but the campaigns she helped form are still going,\u201d said Corey Sundog Mascio in a Facebook message to ICTMN.\n\nListen to Little Thunder discuss the buffalo slaughter:", "article_metadata": {"description": "She helped preserve the Lakota language, and protect sacred sites and species.
