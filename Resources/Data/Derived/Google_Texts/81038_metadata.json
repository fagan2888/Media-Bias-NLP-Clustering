Senate debate\n\nBy Jenna Zhang | Thursday, September 4 2014\n\nDemocratic Senator Kay Hagan and Republican challenger Thom Tillis butted heads over legislative records on the first of three U.S. Senate debates Wednesday.\n\nTillis and Hagan are closely tied in a contentious race slated as one of a critical few on which the Democrat-controlled Senate depends to keep its majority. The Republicans must win six seats in order to tip the balance of power in their favor. A USA TODAY and Suffolk University poll earlier this month showed Hagan two points in the lead, while a poll by the conservative Civitas Institute showed Tillis ahead by one point. Key issues addressed in the debate included education, healthcare, access to contraceptives, immigration and minimum wage.\n\nRundown of central debate issues\n\nHagan criticized Tillis\u2019 record of supporting budget cuts to education funds. Tillis pointed to the N.C. legislature\u2019s recent bill that raises teachers\u2019 salaries by 7 percent, which Hagan countered by noting that senior teachers would only see a 0.3 percent pay raise.\n\n\n\nNorth Carolina has seen an \u201cexodus\u201d of teachers under Tillis\u2019 leadership of the legislature, Hagan said.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act\u2014a centerpiece of the Tillis campaign\u2019s attack ads over the past few months\u2014remained a topic of contention in the debate. Tillis criticized Hagan of breaking her promise that North Carolina residents would be able to keep their healthcare plans, and Hagan accused Tillis of refusing to expand Medicaid for 500,000 residents.\n\nHagan also said she is trying to fix issues within the ACA and attributed the healthcare policy cancellations in part to dishonesty by insurance companies.\n\nWhen asked about the Hobby Lobby decision that corporations cannot be required to provide contraception in their health care plans, Tillis said he supported contraception but added that private businesses had the right of religious freedom not to provide them to employees.\n\n\u201cI actually agree with the American Medical Association that we should make contraception more widely available,\u201d Tillis said.\n\nHagan said Tillis had \u201cconsistently made it difficult\u201d for women to access birth control and accused him of being out of touch with female voters.\n\nWhen pressed to answer whether he thought a $7.25 per hour minimum wage was enough for North Carolina, Tillis responded by saying that with Hagan\u2019s policies, costs would increase to the point that no minimum wage would be sufficient for workers to live on.\n\n\u201cWhat leader would settle for an economy based on minimum wage?\u201d he said.\n\nBoth Hagan and Tillis agreed that action needed to be taken against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, which released a video yesterday of beheading an American journalist, Steven Sotloff, the second such incident to happen in a month.\n\n\n\n\u201cI want to see the president\u2019s plans, and I\u2019m ready to take action,\u201d Hagan said, noting that Obama should have armed moderate Syrian rebels earlier.\n\nOn immigration, both candidates agreed that Obama should not act without Congress on allowing illegal immigrants to remain in the country. Hagan voiced support for the 2013 Gang of Eight Immigration Bill, adding that it was \u201cnot amnesty.\u201d\n\nTillis denounced Obama\u2019s unilateral approach to immigration, saying that the president had turned the three branches of government into \u201cthe executive branch, his pen and his phone.\u201d\n\nHagan slammed Tillis\u2019 voting record in the state legislature\u2014equally unpopular with a disapproval rating of 54 percent. Tillis denounced Hagan for voting closely with President Obama\u2014whose approval rating in North Carolina currently hovers at 41 percent.\n\n\n\nTillis accused Hagan repeatedly of being a rubber stamp for the president and accused her of not fulfilling the promises she would made in the 2008 election, calling her \u201cKay 1.0, Kay 2.0.\u201d\n\n\n\nHagan responded by pointing to Tillis\u2019 support of tax breaks and budget cuts in education during his tenure as Speaker of the N.C. House since 2011.\n\nStakes of the debate\n\n\n\nHagan campaign spokesman Chris Hayden dismissed the possibility that the president\u2019s unpopularity would affect the race\u2014but added that Hagan had fought him on several occasions.\n\n\u201cThe president isn\u2019t on the ballot,\u201d Hayden said.\n\nBut Raffi Williams, deputy press secretary for the Republican National Committee, noted that national issues tend to come more into play in Senate races.\n\nThe race ranks among the most costly in the nation, reporting more outside spending than any other U.S. Senate race currently in progress. Last month, the Charlotte Observer reported that outside advocacy groups had poured in approximately $26 million into television ads for the race, and more recently, the Center for Responsive Politics reported that both campaigns combined have spent around $29 million.\n\n\n\nThe debates have the potential to push both candidates forward in the race, said David Rohde, Ernestine Friedl professor of political science.\n\n\u201cThe normal situation would be that the challenger has a bigger stake in debates, because the challenger would be less well known and of a lesser stature than the incumbent,\u201d Rohde said. \u201cThat\u2019s probably true here.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, the debate also gives Senator Hagan the change to defend herself against the attacks, he added.\n\nThe debate was moderated by CBS News morning show anchor Norah O'Donnell. The second debate is set for Oct. 7, with ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos as moderator.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://ds4q8c259towh.cloudfront.net/20160415XJlq9-dXcb/dist/img/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "description": "The Chronicle is Duke University's independent student newspaper where you can find campus news, Blue Devil sports coverage, features, opinions and breaking news online and in print four days a week.", "generator": "Gryphon 20160217001 (Foundry 6.1-20150615001)", "og": {"site_name": "The Chronicle", "description": "The Chronicle is Duke University's independent student newspaper where you can find campus news, Blue Devil sports coverage, features, opinions and breaking news online and in print four days a week.", "title": "Hagan and Tillis clash over key issues in first N.C.
