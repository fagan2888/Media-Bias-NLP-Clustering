And it does not help when you demonize \u2026 the people you\u2019re talking to.\u201d\n\nBuffett has written extensively about how the Wild West-nature of our financial system and our tax code has produced unprecedented economic inequality while lining the pockets of rich men like himself. This is why he\u2019s the left\u2019s very favorite billionaire. His beef isn\u2019t with the substance of Warren\u2019s politics, it\u2019s with her tone.\n\nThe problem for Buffett is that Warren sometimes gets mad when she talks about a system that manufactures poverty. She is also quite direct when holding regulators and her fellow lawmakers to account for propping up that system.\n\nNow I don\u2019t think it\u2019s controversial to point out that Buffett\u2019s comment \u2014 effectively telling Warren to smile more when critiquing a violently inequitable system \u2014 is sexist. And it\u2019s not going to blow anyone\u2019s mind to point out that his comment can be sexist even if he didn\u2019t mean it that way. That\u2019s how unconscious bias works. We think we\u2019re speaking neutrally, but we\u2019re actually enforcing incredibly narrow and punitive norms.\n\nThis isn\u2019t unique to billionaires on morning news shows, obviously. A recent report on performance reviews for nearly 250 tech company employees found that women are much more likely to receive critical feedback than men \u2014 even in positive reviews.\n\nHere\u2019s how Kieran Snyder described what she found in her research:\n\nWords like bossy, abrasive, strident, and aggressive are used to describe women\u2019s behaviors when they lead; words like emotional and irrational describe their behaviors when they object. All of these words show up at least twice in the women\u2019s review text I reviewed, some much more often. Abrasive alone is used 17 times to describe 13 different women. Among these words, only aggressive shows up in men\u2019s reviews at all. It shows up three times, twice with an exhortation to be more of it.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"I think that she would do better if she was less angry and demonized less,\u201d Buffett said about Warren's tone", "title": "Warren Buffett to Elizabeth Warren: Smile, honey!", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "\"I think that she would do better if she was less angry and demonized less,\u201d Buffett said about Warren's tone", "title": "Warren Buffett to Elizabeth Warren: Smile, honey!", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/02/warren_buffett_to_elizabeth_warren_smile_honey/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/buffet_warren.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"I think that she would do better if she was less angry and demonized less,\u201d Buffett said about Warren's tone", "title": "Warren Buffett to Elizabeth Warren: Smile, honey!", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/buffet_warren.jpg", "creator": "@kmcdonovgh", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Katie McDonough", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Democrats, Economic Recession, Elizabeth Warren, financial corruption, Gender, gender norms, GOP, Poverty, Republicans, Sexism, unconscious bias, Wall Street, War on Poverty, Warren Buffett", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3359\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Democrats, Economic Recession, Elizabeth Warren, financial corruption, Gender, gender norms, GOP, Poverty, Republicans, Sexism, unconscious bias, Wall Street, War on Poverty, Warren Buffett, Politics NewsWarren Buffett thinks Elizabeth Warren should be \u201cless angry\u201d in her approach to politics.\n\u201cI believe in \u2018hate the sin but love the sinner.\u2019 And I\u2019m not sure that I\u2019ve fully convinced Elizabeth Warren that that\u2019s the way to go.\nThe problem for Buffett is that Warren sometimes gets mad when she talks about a system that manufactures poverty.\nNow I don\u2019t think it\u2019s controversial to point out that Buffett\u2019s comment \u2014 effectively telling Warren to smile more when critiquing a violently inequitable system \u2014 is sexist.\nAll of these words show up at least twice in the women\u2019s review text I reviewed, some much more often."}
