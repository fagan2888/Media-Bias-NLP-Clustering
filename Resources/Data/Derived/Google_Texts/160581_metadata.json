Her mother, Sheryl Brown, 33, said Alaijah used to sabotage homecooked family dinners by buying junk food on her way to and from school. Now Alaijah carries fruit or cut vegetables to school.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really an awesome program that\u2019s made it more affordable for me to get fruits and vegetables,\u201d Brown said. \u201cI told my daughter it\u2019s better to be told you\u2019re overweight and here\u2019s the solution than to just be told you\u2019re overweight and sent home.\u201d\n\nMom, too, has benefited. Though not overweight, Brown brought her hypertension under control without medication when, like her daughter, she switched her snacks to fruits and vegetables.\n\nThe Browns are among 50 low-income families with overweight children enrolled in the Fruit and Vegetable Prescription Program, or FVRx, at Harlem Hospital Center. Three other hospitals in New York are also testing the program.\n\nThe program was created by the Laurie M. Tisch Illumination Fund in partnership with Wholesome Wave, a nonprofit group that advocates for access to better food in low-income neighborhoods, and the city\u2019s Health and Hospital Corp.\n\nIt is a startlingly simple idea.\n\nInstead of drugs or admonishments to lose weight, which typically fall on deaf ears, doctors provide families with a \u201cprescription\u201d to eat fruits and vegetables. The families also are given nutritional education, recipes and, most important of all, so-called Health Bucks that are redeemable for produce at a local farmers\u2019 market \u2014 at twice the amount that the families could purchase with food stamps alone. (Brown receives $325 in food stamps each month to feed her family of five.) There is no single solution to the nation\u2019s epidemic of obesity and the costly diseases that result from it. But this and similar programs strongly suggest that providing access to fresh fruits and vegetables, with the means to purchase them and the motivation to do so, can have an impact.\n\nNew York\u2019s FVRx program operates in poor areas known as \u201cfood deserts,\u201d where eating at places like McDonald\u2019s is both cheaper and easier than purchasing fresh foods and preparing them at home.\n\n\u201cFor people today with income shortages, getting good food like high-quality fruits and vegetables is a big problem,\u201d said Michel Nischan, founder of Wholesome Wave, which supports the programs at community health centers.\n\n\u201cA movement to restrict food stamps to healthy foods is well-meaning, but it wouldn\u2019t work in many areas where 7-Elevens are the main source of people\u2019s food,\u201d said Nischan, a former chef who began focusing on nutrition when his son developed Type 2 diabetes. The goal is to \u201clevel the playing field between artificially cheap unhealthy stuff and the healthy foods that wealthier people enjoy.\u201d\n\nParticipants who qualify get tokens, or Health Bucks, to spend on fruits and vegetables at local farmers\u2019 markets. The farmers are reimbursed for the full value of their goods with dollars from community-based nonprofits and grants.\n\nParticipating farmers sell more, increasing their income on average nearly 37 percent. And they can hire more people, put more land in production, diversify crops, and invest more in their farms, Nischan said.\n\nLast year, two New York public hospitals \u2014 Harlem in Manhattan and Lincoln Medical Center in the Bronx \u2014 tested this approach with 550 children and their families, through a five-year, $15 million grant from the Tisch fund. Each month, the young patients meet with their doctor or nutritionist to renew their FVRx, have their body mass index evaluated, and get advice.\n\nAn analysis of last year\u2019s results found that 97 percent of the children and 96 percent of their families ate more fruits and vegetables after joining the program. More than 90 percent of families shopped at farmers\u2019 markets weekly or more than two or three times a month, and 70 percent understood more about healthful eating.\n\nMost astonishing, perhaps, after just four months 40 percent of participating children lowered their BMI.\n\nOne child told Periasamy, \u201cI tried a cucumber today, and it\u2019s good, actually.\u201d A grandmother who had been eating canned foods \u201call these years\u201d now enjoys fresh fruits and vegetables.\n\nThe hospital-based programs and accompanying farmers\u2019 markets in New York ended last month. But competition and consumer enthusiasm have prompted nearby markets and bodegas to carry more and better produce and to price it more affordably, so that families with limited incomes can have year-round access, according to the program directors.\n\nBrown froze some summer produce to cook with this winter. And her daughter has developed a new enthusiasm.\n\n\u201cAlaijah had conversations with the farmers at the market and learned a lot about how things are grown and what\u2019s in season,\u201d Brown said. \u201cLast summer she participated in a new community garden. She was excited by what was grown, because she knew what they were after going to the farmers\u2019 market.\u201d\n\nThe goal now, Laurie Tisch said, is to let more cities know that this approach works and is worth replicating on a larger scale.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2014/12/hfbrody09.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "article_summary": "\u201cIt\u2019s really an awesome program that\u2019s made it more affordable for me to get fruits and vegetables,\u201d Brown said.\nThough not overweight, Brown brought her hypertension under control without medication when, like her daughter, she switched her snacks to fruits and vegetables.\nThe Browns are among 50 low-income families with overweight children enrolled in the Fruit and Vegetable Prescription Program, or FVRx, at Harlem Hospital Center.\nHer mother, Sheryl Brown, 33, said Alaijah used to sabotage homecooked family dinners by buying junk food on her way to and from school.\n(Brown receives $325 in food stamps each month to feed her family of five.)"}
