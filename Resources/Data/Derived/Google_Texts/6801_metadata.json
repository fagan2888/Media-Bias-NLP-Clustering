Bailey even likened it to the N-word.\n\n\u201cWhen you hear a Native American say that \u2018Redskins\u2019 is degrading, it\u2019s almost like the N-word for a black person,\u201d Bailey said according to USA TODAY Sports. \u201cIf they feel that way, then it\u2019s not right. They are part of this country. It\u2019s degrading to a certain race. Does it make sense to have the name?\u201d\n\nBailey, who played his first five seasons with the Washington team then was later traded to the Denver Broncos, said that he admires the team, but it\u2019s time to \u201cmake a change.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where the name came from or how it came about, but the bottom line is that it\u2019s still here in this day and age, and it makes no sense to have it,\u201d Bailey said to USA Today. \u201cI love that organization, but when it starts peeling off old scabs and people are pitching a fit about it because it\u2019s degrading to them, then you\u2019ve got to make a change.\u201d\n\nRELATED: 'Redskins' Player Says Team 'Probably Should' Change Name\n\nUSA TODAY Sports asked Bailey if he could imagine an NFL team existing with a name for an African-American slur, to which Bailey replied, \u201cIt would be out of here.\u201d\n\nBailey said that Snyder\u2019s dogged position not to change the name is making it more difficult for everyone. \u201cI get it, he doesn\u2019t want to change it,\u201d Bailey said. \u201cBut he\u2019s making it worse than it should be.\u201d\n\nBailey lamented that a team he admires would keep such a racist team name. \u201cThey don\u2019t represent anything that name stands for,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a bad reflection of what they really stand for. It\u2019s a bad name.\u201d\n\nUSA TODAY Sports then asked Bailey what would happen if the team did, in fact, change its name. \u201cI don\u2019t think much would change, as far as the branding and all of that. [The team] is still going to be beloved in that city. That\u2019s just the way it is.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "NFL great and former Washington \"Redskins\" player Champ Bailey is the latest voice to come out against the caustic team name.
