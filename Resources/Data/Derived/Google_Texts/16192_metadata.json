The Los Angeles metropolitan area was at the bottom of the list with a 16.9 percent employment rate for 16 to 19 year olds.\n\nThough the Ogden-Clearfield area of Utah had the highest employment rates for teenagers in this age range in 2011, employment rates were still only 43.2 percent.\n\nYoung adults from 20 to 24 years old also saw an employment decrease over the past decade, moving from a 72 percent employment rate in 2000 to a 61 percent employment rate in 2011.\n\nHigher education was \u201cstrongly associated with employment\u201d of 20 to 24 year olds, especially for those with an associate or bachelor\u2019s degree. Young adults who never graduated from high school were more likely to be unemployed than high school graduates.\n\n\u201cIf this were any other group, you would call it a Great Depression,\u201d said Andrew Sum, professor of economics at Northeastern University and co-author of the Brookings study, to The Boston Globe.\n\nJobs that traditionally went to teenagers in the past are now sometimes going to older people looking for work. It can be difficult for teenagers and young adults to compete with workers with years of experience.\n\nThough the report uses data from 2010-2011, Brookings also created an interactive tool that examines the same factors using more recent data from 2012. The tool covers employment data for teenagers and young adults in the largest 100 metropolitan areas in the U.S.\n\nPlease follow and like us:\n\nPlease Leave A Comment\n\ncomments", "article_metadata": {"description": "A record number of teenagers are unable to find jobs, with 2011 employment rates for ages 16 to 19 reaching the lowest numbers since the World War II era.", "og": {"site_name": "Business Administration Information", "description": "A record number of teenagers are unable to find jobs, with 2011 employment rates for ages 16 to 19 reaching the lowest numbers since the World War II era.", "title": "Study: Teens Face Employment Crisis - Business Administration Information", "url": "http://www.businessadministrationinformation.com/news/study-teens-face-employment-crisis", "image": "http://www.businessadministrationinformation.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/teenagers-young-adults-unemployment-300x200.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1478982362392941}, "msvalidate.01": "E97402E8C75E1396BEAE2A02AE1A06E8", "google-site-verification": "-7d0XhlweD9ac6X0iGygOuxos-tqbyEAEVk9SXNyc-Y", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "teens, unemployment, teenage unemployment, young adult unemployment"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8bb2\"", "article_summary": "Though the Ogden-Clearfield area of Utah had the highest employment rates for teenagers in this age range in 2011, employment rates were still only 43.2 percent.\nYoung adults from 20 to 24 years old also saw an employment decrease over the past decade, moving from a 72 percent employment rate in 2000 to a 61 percent employment rate in 2011.\nThe tool covers employment data for teenagers and young adults in the largest 100 metropolitan areas in the U.S.\nThe study, \u201cThe Plummeting Labor Market Fortunes of Teens and Young Adults,\u201d used data from the U.S. Department of Labor to examine the employment rate of teenagers and young adults from the largest 100 metropolitan areas.\nYoung adults who never graduated from high school were more likely to be unemployed than high school graduates."}
