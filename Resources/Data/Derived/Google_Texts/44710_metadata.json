It\u2019s life and death,\u201d said Dr. Swapnil Shah, Chief of Orthopedics.\n\n\u201cSometimes it gets crazy,\u201d said Dr. Chris Hahn. \u201cWe have every trauma bay filled.\u201d\n\nAbout a dozen physicians from Highland here produced a rap video called, \u2018Welcome to County.\u2019\n\nMost patients don\u2019t expect the doctors who care for them to rap. \u201cI don\u2019t look like a typical rapper,\u201d said lead singer Hahn. \u201cShock and disbelief.\u201d\n\nDr. Shah is the producer of the video. \u201cThat\u2019s what music is. It\u2019s about life, it\u2019s about obstacles, it\u2019s about joy,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what people want to hear in music.\u201d\n\nThe doctors have combined their dual passions of medicine and rap music to convey the importance of county hospitals, saying these safety-net hospitals will lose $500 million dollars next year as Obamacare fully rolls out.\n\nBecause the government now expects everyone to have insurance, it will no longer gives lump sum amounts to hospitals that serve the poor and the underinsured.\n\nThe doctors said there is no political message here. They just want people to support county hospitals.\n\nWithout the support, the doctors fear their hospital will meet the same fate as Doctors Medical Center in San Pablo, which has seen services whittled away and the facility downsized. Only emergency funding will keep it afloat.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s vital people pay attention now,\u201d said Shah. \u201cIt\u2019s the transition period. Transition period is what [will] make it or break it.\u201d\n\nIt took the doctors about a year and a half to write and produce the music video, paid for out of their own pockets.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Oakland doctors concerned about the funding of county hospitals are taking a one-of-a-kind approach to publicizing that concern, with the release of a slickly-produced rap video.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2014/09/05/oakland-doctors-produce-welcome-to-county-rap-video-to-publicize-hospital-funding-needs-highland-youtube-rapping/", "image": {"width": 780, "secure_url": "https://cbssanfran.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/capture.jpg?w=780", "identifier": "https://cbssanfran.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/capture.jpg?w=780", "height": 443}, "type": "article", "description": "Oakland doctors concerned about the funding of county hospitals are taking a one-of-a-kind approach to publicizing that concern, with the release of a slickly-produced rap video.", "title": "Oakland Doctors Produce 'Welcome To County' Rap Video To Publicize Hospital Funding Needs"}, "twitter": {"site": "cbssf", "image": "https://cbssanfran.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/capture.jpg?w=780", "description": "Oakland doctors concerned about the funding of county hospitals are taking a one-of-a-kind approach to publicizing that concern, with the release of a slickly-produced rap video.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Oakland Doctors Produce 'Welcome To County' Rap Video To Publicize Hospital Funding Needs"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Sports, Weather, Traffic and the Best of SF", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CBS San Francisco", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/CBSSanFrancisco", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/CBSSanFrancisco"}, "keywords": "aca information, affordable care act, health, local, news, syndicated local, chris hahn, county hospitals, da lin, doctors medical center, hahn, highland hospital, oakland, rap video, rapping doctors, shah, swapnil shah, trauma, trauma surgeon, welcome to county", "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/73943609873d357bc6a7462619ad7be9?s=16", "news_keywords": "chris hahn, county hospitals, da lin, doctors medical center, hahn, highland hospital, oakland, rap video, rapping doctors, shah, swapnil shah, trauma, trauma surgeon, welcome to county"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb698\"", "article_summary": "OAKLAND (KPIX 5) \u2014 Oakland doctors concerned about the funding of county hospitals are taking a one-of-a-kind approach to publicizing that concern, with the release of a slickly-produced rap video.\nThe hospital featured in the video, Highland Hospital, is the scene of a seemingly daily procession of trauma victims.\nThey just want people to support county hospitals.\n\u201cWe have every trauma bay filled.\u201dAbout a dozen physicians from Highland here produced a rap video called, \u2018Welcome to County.\u2019Most patients don\u2019t expect the doctors who care for them to rap.\nTransition period is what [will] make it or break it.\u201dIt took the doctors about a year and a half to write and produce the music video, paid for out of their own pockets."}
