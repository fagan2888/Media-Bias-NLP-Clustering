Perhaps most vocally during his 2012 vice presidential debate with Mitt Romney\u2019s running mate Paul Ryan. At the debate, he said the following:\n\n\u201cWith regard to abortion, I accept my Church\u2019s position on abortion as a de fide doctrine. Life begins at conception. I accept that position in my personal life.\u201d\n\nYet, in the same discussion, he suggested women\u2019s autonomy trumps the right to life:\n\n\u201cI do not believe that we have a right to tell other people, women that they cannot control their body. It\u2019s a decision between them and their doctor in my view, and the Supreme Court. And I\u2019m not going to interfere with that.\u201d\n\nThree years later, Biden\u2019s abortion stance is just as confusing, and a bit hypocritical. With Pope Francis\u2019s trip to Washington, D.C., America, a Jesuit-run outlet, took advantage of the opportunity to return to the topic on Monday. The publication asked the Catholic VP whether it\u2019s been difficult for him to be at odds on the issue with the country\u2019s bishops:\n\n\u201cIt has been\u2026I'm prepared to accept that at the moment of conception there's human life and being, but I'm not prepared to say that to other God\u00adfearing, non\u00adGod\u00adfearing people that have a different view.\u201d\n\nIt is encouraging that he believes in life from conception, but Biden\u2019s refusal to encourage others to acknowledge the same is somewhat disheartening.\n\nThe vice president was then asked whether the Democratic Party has room for pro-lifers. He gave an emphatic nod:\n\n\u201cAbsolutely. Absolutely, positively. And that's been my position for as long as I've been engaged.\u201d\n\nWhile I appreciate the vice president\u2019s optimism, he is, in my opinion, a bit na\u00efve in his assumption. Time and again Democratic leadership has practiced a pro-abortion agenda that has no patience for anyone who takes the side of unborn babies over \u201cwomen\u2019s rights.\u201d For instance, even a three-year investigation into Planned Parenthood\u2019s barbaric practices has not stopped Democrats from defending the abortion giant. Congressional pro-lifers have tried repeatedly to pass common sense legislation to protect unborn life, as recently as Tuesday with the Pain-capable Unborn Child Protection Act. Democrats halted that effort despite the scientific fact that unborn babies can feel pain at 20 weeks gestation.\n\nYou can see why I\u2019m a bit skeptical.\n\nTo be fair, three Democrats did join their Republican colleagues in that humane vote.
