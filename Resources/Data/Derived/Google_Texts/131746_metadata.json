Attorneys general in at least a dozen states are working with energy companies and other corporate interests, which in turn are providing them with record amounts of money for their political campaigns, including at least $16 million this year. They share a common philosophy about the reach of the federal government, but the companies also have billions of dollars at stake. And the collaboration is likely to grow: For the first time in modern American history, Republicans in January will control a majority \u2014 27 \u2014 of attorneys general\u2019s offices.\n\nWhat The Times uncovered is an example of something that the majority of Democratic voters don\u2019t understand. State elections are in some ways more important than federal elections. State elections in midterm years really matter.\n\nCorporations and big money right-wing millionaires and billionaires have systematically been dumping money into state races for positions like secretary of state and attorney general. Unlike the purchase of the support of member of the House or Senate, having a state attorney general in their pocket can yield immediate access to power and results.\n\nCorporations and the big money interests couldn\u2019t beat the president at the federal level, so they are using Republican elected officials as proxies for their agenda in a state level fight.\n\nIt is amazing that this president has accomplished as much as he has given the well-funded opposition that he has faced. The media often focuses on the federal level party conflicts, but Republicans have their way in the majority of states.\n\nIf Democrats don\u2019t grow their base beyond turning out for presidential elections, the special interests could take over the ground beneath their feet.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A secret alliance of Republican officials and energy companies has been working together to conspire to thwart executive actions taken by President Obama.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Jason Easley", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "A secret alliance of Republican officials and energy companies has been working together to conspire to thwart executive actions taken by President Obama.", "title": "Republicans Have Been Working With Energy Companies In Secret Conspiracy Against Obama", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2014/12/07/republicans-working-energy-companies-secret-conspiracy-obama.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/obama-keystone.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-12-07T11:21:19+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Featured News,Issues,energy conspiracy obama,Obama,republican conspiracy against obama,secret republican energy company alliance,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Issues", "published_time": "2014-12-07T11:21:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-07T11:21:19+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "energy conspiracy obama, Obama, republican conspiracy against obama, secret republican energy company alliance"}, "article_summary": "A secret alliance of Republican officials and energy companies has been working together to conspire to thwart executive actions taken by President Obama.\nState elections are in some ways more important than federal elections.\nState elections in midterm years really matter.\nThe media often focuses on the federal level party conflicts, but Republicans have their way in the majority of states.\nThey share a common philosophy about the reach of the federal government, but the companies also have billions of dollars at stake."}
