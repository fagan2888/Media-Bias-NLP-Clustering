ColoradoCare would, its backers say, be run by a nonprofit cooperative.\n\nDespite the fact that it easily obtained more than the number of signatures needed to make the ballot (although the state hasn\u2019t verified that yet), the initiative seems oddly timed.\n\nAfter all, Vermont \u2014 home to socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders \u2014 had already tried to implement a single payer system instead of ObamaCare. In fact, an article in the New England Journal of Medicine said that Gov. Peter Shumlin\u2019s \u201cexploration of a single-payer health care system, which included three assessments by different expert groups, was among the most exhaustive ever conducted in the United States.\u201d\n\nBut Shumlin backed down last December once he realized the problems that it would create for the state.\n\n\u201cIt is not the right time for Vermont\u201d to pass a single-payer system, Shumlin said. The state was considering a payroll tax of about 15% to fund the program, which he decided \u201cmight hurt our economy.\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s Colorado\u2019s own recent and dismal record running health care.\n\nThe state\u2019s ObamaCare exchange has seen its projected operating costs more than double, forcing Connect for Health Colorado to boost the fee that it charges all insurance consumers in the state, and more than double the user fee charged to those who sign up through its exchange. Even that won\u2019t cover all of its costs.\n\nOn top of that, Colorado\u2019s existing nonprofit cooperative \u2014 created with $72 million in federal loans courtesy of ObamaCare \u2014 just went belly up.\n\nIn its first year of operation, the co-op lost $23 million, according to a government audit. And before it decided to close shop, Colorado HealthOP had requested shockingly high rate increases of up to 24% for next year.\n\nAs a result of the HealthOP closure, more than 80,000 people in the state will have to look for another ObamaCare carrier when they go to sign up, starting in November.\n\nIf all this isn\u2019t enough to convince Colorado voters that driving further down the road of government-run health care is a bad idea, you\u2019d really have to start to wonder what it is they\u2019re smoking over there.\n\nFollow John Merline on Twitter: @IBD_JMerline.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Conspiracy theorists who think ObamaCare was just a steppingstone to a single payer system now have a shred of evidence to back up their claim.
