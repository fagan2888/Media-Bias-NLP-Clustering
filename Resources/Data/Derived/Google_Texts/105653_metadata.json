That's the rate at which carbon-dioxide emissions increased in 2013 and will increase in 2014, respectively, according to a new study released ahead of the U.N. climate summit in New York.\n\nWonkbook\u2019s Chart of the Day: The racial divide in America's gun deaths, explained with multiple charts.\n\nWonkbook's Top 5 Stories: (1) The climate-change long game; (2) global economic and financial concerns at the G-20; (3) the worst-case Ebola scenario; and (4) what went wrong with White House security.\n\n1. Top story: This week's U.N. climate summit is all about the long game\n\nDon't expect a breakthrough. This is about building momentum. \"Whatever happens at the U.N. summit is unlikely to bring the Earth closer to a goal set in Copenhagen: Preventing Earth's temperature from rising more than 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1.2 degrees Celsius) from where it is now....Rather than firm commitments from closed-door negotiations, the summit is expected to jumpstart a series of much publicized initiatives and partnerships. Six oil companies will join with governments and environmental advocacy groups to slash methane leaks from the production of natural gas. There will be a massive commitment to combat deforestation. There will be initiatives announced to clean up agriculture and make freight shipments greener.\" Dina Cappiello in the Associated Press.\n\nExplainer: 5 things to know about the U.N. climate summit in New York. Dina Cappiello in the Associated Press.\n\nSummit shows the political, diplomatic challenges of achieving global climate accord. \"The high-level gathering...is likely to underscore the diplomatic and political difficulties ahead as the governments seek to hammer out a treaty limiting global greenhouse-gas emissions by late next year. The Obama administration separately faces tough negotiations with overseas trading partners China and India over proposed cuts in fossil-fuel burning, while also defending its climate policies against attacks from Republican opponents in Washington. But...an increasingly energetic movement...will be on display on the summit\u2019s periphery.\" Joby Warrick and Steven Mufson in The Washington Post.\n\nThe record-breaking march over the weekend adds to that perception. \"Hundreds of thousands marched through Manhattan and in cities around the world today demanding government action on climate change in what organizers called the largest climate demonstration ever. The People\u2019s Climate March drew more than 310,000 people to New York this weekend, organizers said, tripling the original forecast....Among the marchers was UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon....Singer Sting, actor Leonardo DiCaprio and Vermont Independent Senator Bernie Sanders joined the march.\" Allyson Versprille and Mark Drajem in Bloomberg.\n\nBut the elephant in the room is the divide in nations' wealth. \"As they seek to build momentum for a new global deal on climate change by 2015, the 126 heads of state in attendance are likely to find themselves plagued by an old divide....If history is any guide, the rich countries of the world will say how concerned they are about the damage their emissions of heat-trapping gases are causing. The poor countries \u2014 whose people have done little to contribute to global warming but stand to suffer the most from it...will point out that this professed concern never seems to translate into sufficient action.\" Justin Gillis and Coral Davenport in The New York Times.\n\nAnd else being equal, the globe will have a tough time meeting that Copenhagen promise. \"Spurred chiefly by China, the United States and India, the world spewed far more carbon pollution into the air last year than ever before, scientists announced Sunday....The world pumped...778 million tons...or 2.3 percent more than the previous year....The team projects that emissions of carbon dioxide...are increasing by 2.5 percent this year. The scientists forecast that emissions will continue to increase, adding that the world in about 30 years will warm by about 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1.1 degrees Celsius) from now. In 2009, world leaders called that level dangerous and pledged not to reach it.\" Seth Borenstein in the Associated Press.\n\nPoor nations' climate-change spending needs will crowd out health, education funds. \"Poor countries have had to divert large chunks of their budget to adapt to climate change and run the risk of crowding out spending on health and education....according to the report by the Overseas Development Institute (ODI)....The three countries featured...are heavily dependent on rain-fed agriculture and have all experienced higher temperatures and reductions of water sources consistent with climate change. All have invested heavily to adapt their farming and cities in the absence of promised international aid....The study exposes large funding gaps between each country\u2019s proposals to address climate change and what is available.\" John Vidal in The Guardian.\n\nForget the national debt. The new budget threat is climate change, White House argues. \"The White House is not just blowing smoke. The independent, nonpartisan General Accounting Office \u2014 which exists to monitor government spending \u2014 last year added climate change to its high-risk list....In the next few days, a host of administration officials are scheduled to hammer that point and to tout Obama's efforts to slow greenhouse gas emissions....To bolster the boss, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew on Monday will visit the Brookings Institution to argue that the nation can fight climate change and grow the economy, echoing a recent report from an international commission on climate change.\" Lori Montgomery in The Washington Post.\n\nVideo: New Obama budget chief Shaun Donovan's first speech focused on climate change's potential threat to U.S. finances. Center for American Progress.\n\nTeam Obama will showcase U.S. efforts to cut emissions, but won't commit to aid for poor nations. \"The UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, has challenged the 125 world leaders attending the 23 September summit to make 'bold pledges' to the fund....The UN has been pressing rich countries to come up with pledges of between $10bn and $15bn....But cash for the Green Climate Fund \u2014 to help poor countries move off fossil fuels and protect their people from rising seas, heat waves and other consequences of climate change \u2014 will not be part of Obama\u2019s agenda at this UN meeting.\" Suzanne Goldenberg in The Guardian.\n\nScientists' 'fair share' system for climate change would have U.S., rich nations cutting the most. \"Rich nations should make the deepest emission cuts and provide most money if countries are to share fairly the responsibility of preventing catastrophic climate change, says a major new study....The first scientific attempt to link precise emission cuts and the money needed to hold temperatures to a 1.5C rise by 2025 takes UN data and calculates each country\u2019s 'fair share'. It does so by factoring in how much carbon each country has emitted historically, how much wealth it has and its population. The principle of fairness, and the right of some countries to receive support, are accepted in the UN climate talks.\" John Vidal in The Guardian.\n\nClimate change fear spurs divestment on fossil fuels... \"The fledgling movement to divest shares tied to fossil fuels, which started at a handful of universities and foundations, has grown to 180 institutions and local governments and 654 individuals, with a total of $50 billion in assets, according to a report to be issued Monday afternoon by an activist group that works with investors. Foundations that have recently decided to divest from fossil-fuel holdings include the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, a philanthropy with more than $700 million in assets that was created by the grandchildren of the oil magnate John D. Rockefeller Sr.\" Neela Banerjee in the Los Angeles Times.\n\n...but does all this divestment really matter? \"It's still small in comparison to the scope of the fossil fuel industry. And the movement...has faced some recent setbacks....A recent report from the research and analysis company Bloomberg New Energy Finance notes that nearly 1,500 exchange-listed oil-and-gas companies are together valued at $4.65 trillion, although the coal industry's valuation is far smaller....In addition, oil-and-gas companies have ample financial resources and access to capital markets to fund projects, and divestment critics point out that when one party dumps a stock, another buys it....But Dorsey said divestment advocates are well aware that they're not positioned to deal a financial knockout blow to the massive fossil fuel industry any time soon.\" Ben Geman in National Journal.\n\nLong read: Natural gas alone isn't the magic answer.

Clifford Krauss in The New York Times.\n\nBig factories go to work on biofuels. Diane Cardwell in The New York Times.\n\nSTAVINS: Climate realities. \"It is true that, in theory, we can avoid the worst consequences of climate change with an intensive global effort over the next several decades. But given real-world economic and, in particular, political realities, that seems unlikely....Despite these obstacles, a developing convergence of interests of the two key emitting countries \u2014 China and the United States \u2014 offers hope for progress....Both countries are moving forward with regional, market-based programs to reduce emissions....The linkage of such systems both within countries and across international borders holds promise as an environmentally effective and cost-effective approach to reducing emissions in coming years.\" Robert N. Stavins in The New York Times.\n\nMcKIBBEN: Breaking 25 years of stalemate on climate change. \"The collapse of the Copenhagen climate conference in 2009 was a signal event in diplomatic history, calling into question the ability of our societies to act cooperatively in the face of clear scientific warnings. There is no prospect of anything much happening next week at the climate summit, either....But we've learned a few good things too. In the handful of countries that have taken the threat seriously, technical progress has been unimaginably swift....It shows that political will, not engineering prowess, is the limiting factor to our progress....The good news is that political will is something we can create. But only if we march.\" Bill McKibben in Foreign Policy.\n\nMcARDLE: Fixing climate change will never be free. \"Noneconomic costs are always hard to factor into these sorts of calculations. But they need to be brought up, because they will factor heavily in any analysis of the political feasibility of your proposal. For example, they point out that Atlantans could save a lot of money on transportation if their city had the petite footprint of Barcelona. But said Atlantans would have to live in tiny apartments rather than large single-family homes with yards. They might not like that....Even if this is a free lunch over the long term, it is not a free lunch right now to the people who would need to make major changes in their lives. No matter how long you point to the equations, they will resist.\" Megan McArdle in Bloomberg View.\n\nKOONIN: The hardest questions to answer about the climate. \"The crucial scientific question for policy isn't whether the climate is changing. That is a settled matter....Nor is the crucial question whether humans are influencing the climate. That is no hoax....Rather, the crucial, unsettled scientific question for policy is, 'How will the climate change over the next century under both natural and human influences?' Answers to that question at the global and regional levels, as well as to equally complex questions of how ecosystems and human activities will be affected, should inform our choices about energy and infrastructure. But \u2014 here's the catch \u2014 those questions are the hardest ones to answer.\" Steven E. Koonin in The Wall Street Journal.\n\nETSY: A bottom-up approach. \"I believe we need to shift gears and try something new. Relying on national governments alone to deliver results is not enough, as the last two decades have shown. The real action on climate change around the world is coming from governors, mayors, corporate chief executives and community leaders. They are the ones best positioned to make change happen on the ground. Accordingly, we need to move from a top-down strategy to a bottom-up approach.\" Daniel Etsy in The New York Times.\n\nELLIS AND ELLIS: Trees offer a way to delay the consequences of climate change... \"When a tree is cut down, it releases carbon into the atmosphere; when it is allowed to grow, however, it continues to absorb carbon. The environmental impact of forest conservation is double-barreled. The more we cut, the more we compound our problem, but conversely, the more that forests regrow, the stronger our potential for recovery. If we stopped deforestation tomorrow, the total power of forests would offset a third of our human-caused carbon emissions. Until we are prepared to wean ourselves from fossil fuels, forests are a stopgap that allow us to minimize the damage and save us from ourselves.\" Joseph J. Ellis and Peter Ellis in The Washington Post.\n\nUNGER: ...or maybe not. \"The cycling of carbon, energy and water between the land and the atmosphere is much more complex. Considering all the interactions, large-scale increases in forest cover can actually make global warming worse....Besides the amount of greenhouse gases in the air, another important switch on the planetary thermostat is how much of the sun\u2019s energy is taken up by the earth\u2019s surface, compared to how much is reflected back to space. The dark color of trees means that they absorb more of the sun\u2019s energy and raise the planet\u2019s surface temperature. Climate scientists have calculated the effect of increasing forest cover....Their conclusion is that planting trees in the tropics would lead to cooling, but in colder regions, it would cause warming.\" Nadine Unger in The New York Times.\n\nTop opinion\n\nFRIST: The dire need for a rapid diagnostic device in West Africa. \"Stemming the tide of this epidemic will not happen with only the commitment the President has made....First, there are cultural barriers to containment such as distrust of Western medicine....Second, there is fear of the disease and what identification and isolation means.....Finally, we do not have a way of rapidly identifying the virus in the field....An RDT \u2014 a new test or an adaptation of what we have \u2014 would not only be a massive step towards controlling this outbreak, I think it is the only step that will ultimately prevent this tragic epidemic from becoming a pandemic.\" Bill Frist in Forbes.\n\nSAMUELSON: The next nasty economic surprise? \"We live in the shadow of 'secular stagnation,' to use a phrase now fashionable among economists. Even assuming a full recovery from the Great Recession, it\u2019s widely expected that the economy will grow more slowly in the future than in the past. In part, this reflects baby boomers\u2019 retirement, which reduces expansion of the labor force. Pre-recession growth was also artificially boosted by cheap credit. Forecasts have been cut, but they haven\u2019t been cut enough, says economist Robert Gordon. If he\u2019s right, this could be our next nasty economic surprise.\" Robert J. Samuelson in The Washington Post.\n\nSUROWIECKI: Give the homeless homes. \"In 2005, Utah set out to fix a problem that\u2019s often thought of as unfixable: chronic homelessness. The state had almost two thousand chronically homeless people. Most of them had mental-health or substance-abuse issues, or both. At the time, the standard approach was to try to make homeless people 'housing ready': first, you got people into shelters or halfway houses and put them into treatment; only when they made progress could they get a chance at permanent housing. Utah, though, embraced a different strategy, called Housing First: it started by just giving the homeless homes. Handing mentally ill substance abusers the keys to a new place may sound like an example of wasteful government spending. But it turned out to be the opposite.\" James Surowiecki in The New Yorker.\n\nMcARDLE: How many rape reports are actually false? We don't know. \"Feminists would like to rectify that unfairness by treating rape accusations as presumptively true, making it easier for victims to come forward. That\u2019s understandable. But there\u2019s a risk that this makes it easier for false accusations to get through the system, resulting in destroyed lives for men such as Brian Banks. Men\u2019s-rights activists would like to make it harder for innocent men to get caught in a web of lies, so they want rape accusations to be interrogated with deep suspicion. But treating rape victims as possible or likely liars may make it harder for them to go forward....No one wants to openly advocate for a hard choice that will end in injustice for someone. So instead we get the war of bad statistics.\" Megan McArdle in Bloomberg View.\n\nDYNARSKI: Why federal college ratings won't rein in tuition. \"As far as students are concerned, public tuition has doubled. As far as public colleges are concerned, funding is flat. At public colleges, then, the explanation for rising tuition prices isn\u2019t spiraling costs. The costs are the same, but the burden of paying those costs has shifted from state taxpayers to students. Given this structure, can a ratings system affect tuition prices at public colleges? Not really....The Obama administration seems intent on putting the ratings in place in short order. Along with many others, I advise slowing down to get it right. A hastily executed system that relies on faulty data and ill-conceived measures will be not a proud legacy of this administration but a lasting liability.\" Susan Dynarski in The New York Times.\n\nTeary-eyed interlude: Mother's last dance with her son just after he got married.\n\n2. Economic and financial worries at the G-20\n\nFirst, G-20 hashes out a growth goal, but Europe remains a stumbling block. \"Almost 1,000 measures had been proposed that would boost global growth by 1.8 percent by 2018, nearing the ambitious goal of 2 percentage points adopted back in February. A common concern was the risk of Europe's economic malaise pulling others down. U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew cited 'philosophical' differences with some of his counterparts in Europe, especially on the need for near-term stimulus....The proposals to lift global growth will now go for formal approval at the summit of G20 leaders in Brisbane in November. Chief among them was a global initiative aimed at increasing private investment in infrastructure.\" Ian Chua and Cecile Lefort in Reuters.\n\nBackground reading: Could Europe's economic woes weigh on the U.S.? Don Lee in the Los Angeles Times.\n\nNext, as G-20 seeks to stop tax avoidance, Lew says corporate inversion rule to be done soon... \"Lew...reiterated that while the Obama administration wants to revamp the broader U.S. corporate tax code, 'there is one loophole that should be shut down immediately \u2014 inversions.'...The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and G-20 economies are working on plans for a global exchange of information to stop tax-avoidance strategies used by companies such as Google Inc., Apple Inc. and Yahoo! Inc. Multinational companies hold an estimated $2 trillion in low-tax jurisdictions, OECD Secretary General Angel Gurria told reporters Sept. 20.\" Ian Katz in Bloomberg.\n\nEuropean firms over inversions. \"As the Obama administration finalises plans to curb 'tax inversion' deals, big European companies that typically stay out of US politics \u2014 including Nestl\u00e9, Royal Dutch Shell, Airbus and BASF \u2014 are alarmed at the risk to their own US divisions....In recent weeks a little-known lobby group has arranged for executives from European multinationals to voice their concerns directly to administration officials and lawmakers, according to a person with knowledge of the meetings.\" Barney Jopson in The Financial Times.\n\nSenate Dems propose 'exit tax' for inverting companies. \"Republicans want to address the problem through broad corporate tax reform that lowers rates. But many Democrats want to act sooner. Proposals range from making it more difficult to invert to blocking certain tactics foreign companies use to reduce U.S. taxes. Foreign profits earned by U.S.-based companies are not taxed in the United States until they are repatriated, so many companies hold cash and invest overseas to avoid those taxes. Lawmakers have bemoaned this trend, which they say 'traps' cash abroad. Brown's plan gets at both issues by taxing those foreign earnings when a company inverts.\" Emily Stephenson in Reuters.\n\nDrugmaker defies House Dems' efforts on inversions. \"Horizon Pharma Inc. (HZNP), a Deerfield, Illinois-based specialty drugmaker, shifted its corporate address to Ireland....defying a threat by Democratic lawmakers to unwind such maneuvers retroactively. Now known as Horizon Pharma Plc, it\u2019s the first company to complete an address change, known as an inversion, that risks being overturned if legislation submitted by congressional Democrats this year becomes law. Under that proposal, intended to halt a wave of such deals, companies that carry out certain types of inversions after May 8 would remain U.S. corporations for tax purposes.\" Zachary R. Mider in Bloomberg.\n\nFinally, G-20 worries linger over loose monetary policy. \"Risks from shadow banking are growing fast, according to International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde. While Lagarde said central banks have tools to react to potential excess valuations in various parts of the market, Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann said the environment of low interest rates can threaten financial stability. Investors are becoming complacent about risks in financial markets, the Financial Stability Board said last week....G-20 finance chiefs will monitor the potential increase in financial market risks, while strengthening policy frameworks, according to the communique.\" Jason Scott, Theophilos Argitis and Raymond Colitt in Bloomberg.\n\nThe Fed's new overnight reverse repo-driven tool for lifting rates is drawing concerns, too. \"Central bank policy makers capped the size of the overnight reverse repurchase facility, a borrowing program to manage bank reserves that has put a floor under short-term interest rates. The $300-billion-per-day limit...which has been exceeded before, would, if breached, force market participants to lend cash overnight at rates below what the Fed offers....The Fed has been testing overnight reverse repos with a limited set of counterparties, mostly money-market mutual funds, for the past year at a fixed rate, currently 0.05 percent. These tests have showed the tool has been an effective floor.\" Liz Capo McCormick and Matthew Boesler in Bloomberg.\n\nMark your calendars, wonks: In October, the New York Fed will host a conference on bank ethics and culture.

What's the worst-case scenario for Ebola?\n\n550,000 or more would be infected by end of January, initial CDC findings say. \"The projection, which vastly outstrips previous estimates, is under review by researchers and may change. It assumes no additional aid or intervention by governments and relief agencies, which are mobilizing to contain the Ebola outbreak before it spirals further out of control in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea....The World Health Organization said last month that the outbreak could reach 20,000 cases before being brought under control. That projection is already outdated, WHO spokesman Dan Epstein said.\" Caroline Chen, Brendan Greeley and Kelly Gilblom in Bloomberg.\n\nWorld Bank warns of 'catastrophic' economic impact if virus keeps spreading. \"The World Bank warned that the economic costs of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa will escalate to 'catastrophic' proportions if the virus spreads....The spread of the virus may cost Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, the three nations where most infections have taken place, as much as $809 million, the World Bank said on Sept. 17. Early findings of the lender\u2019s research into the economic risks of the disease spreading to other countries show the damage could be more severe, he said.\" Matthew Hill and Elena Popina in Bloomberg.\n\nU.S. forces may need to move in a bit quicker, a top military official says. \"Gen. Ray Odierno, the Army chief of staff, said the disease has accelerated faster than initially thought, so the U.S. needs to get people on the ground and ramp up numbers quickly. President Barack Obama has pledged 3,000 troops, and the U.S. military commander and a small team has arrived in Liberia to do initial assessments. Before troops are sent in, Odierno says, the Army needs to make sure they are prepared to operate in that environment, which includes health care safety. The military units expected to deploy have not been identified.\" Lolita C. Baldor in the Associated Press.\n\nIs budget-strapped WHO now effectively on the sidelines? \"The United Nations said it would create a separate Health Mission to coordinate care in West Africa, and the U.S. announced it would send 3,000 troops to build hospitals there. Those plans come after Chan delayed designating the outbreak as a global emergency until thousands were infected in three countries, and in the wake of complaints her agency had done too little to manage the response. Now, the WHO is in the awkward spot of being little more than a voice in the crowd, critics suggest, and Chan is seen by some as being partly to blame.\" Simeon Bennett in Bloomberg.\n\nA 747 airlifts 100 tons of medical supplies to West Africa. \"The 100 tons of supplies include gloves, masks, gowns, goggles, saline, antibiotics, oral rehydration solution and pain killers....Basic medical supplies are in short supply in countries where Ebola has hit. Many hospitals lack even running water and soap, according to officials from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention....If the outbreak isn't stopped soon, it could spread to other countries and last for years, according to CDC officials. World leaders are worried that the epidemic now is growing at an exponential rate.\" Liz Szabo in USA Today.\n\nChart: What does it mean that Ebola is growing at an exponential rate? Michaeleen Doucleff in NPR.\n\nAgain, it bears worth mentioning... The U.S. itself probably won't have an Ebola outbreak. Abby Phillip in The Washington Post.\n\nRare enterovirus sickening children now confirmed in 22 states. \"The respiratory illness affecting children has now been detected in 160 people across 22 states and the numbers will likely grow, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That's because only the CDC and a small number of state public health laboratories can perform the test to diagnose Enterovirus 68 or EV-D68, which is 'complex and slower,' according to the Atlanta-based health agency. Also, several states are still investigating clusters of suspected cases....The Atlanta-based health agency also points out that we are in the middle of enterovirus season, which is summer and fall, which means the number of states affected will likely rise.\" Melanie Eversley in USA Today.\n\nOther health care reads:\n\nCongress urged to pass bill to speed up development of antibiotics.

What went wrong with White House security?\n\nHow did a man make it to the White House front door? \"The success Omar J. Gonzalez, 42, had...exposed new, worrisome gaps in the Secret Service\u2019s extensive efforts to keep the first family safe and make the White House a 'hard target.' The front door on the North Portico of the mansion was unlocked at the time. It is a frequently used door, just one flight of stairs away from the Obama\u2019s living quarters, and until now, the Secret Service didn\u2019t imagine an intruder could reach it. A trained attack dog \u2014 the Secret Service\u2019s fail-safe measure for stopping intruders when officers cannot \u2014 was not released in this case. The reasons are under investigation.\" Carol D. Leonnig, Spencer Hsu and Annys Shin in The Washington Post.\n\nYour next visit to the White House may involve security screenings. \"One proposal is to keep people off the sidewalks around the White House fence and create several yards of additional barrier around the compound\u2019s perimeter. Another is to screen visitors as far as a block away from the entrance gates....The National Park Service controls much of the property on the border, so all ideas will have to be reviewed by multiple agencies as well as the Obama administration....But the incident has sounded alarms at all levels of the Secret Service. On Saturday, Julia Pierson, director of the Secret Service, advised Obama\u2019s senior staff that she had begun an internal review....She also stressed that she will take immediate steps to shore up security.\" Carol D. Leonnig in The Washington Post.\n\nMeanwhile, Feds censure local police for civil-rights violations, yet give them military-surplus weapons. \"The Pentagon, which provides the free surplus military equipment, says its consultation with the Justice Department will be looked at as the government reviews how to prevent high-powered weaponry from flowing to the untrustworthy. The Justice Department has opened civil rights investigations into the practices of some 20 police departments in the past five years, with the Ferguson force the latest. The investigations sometimes end in negotiated settlements known as consent decrees that mandate reforms. Yet being flagged as problematic by Washington does not bar a police department from participating in the program.\" Tami Abdollah and Eric Tucker in the Associated Press.\n\nICYMI: Feds to study racial bias and reduce community-police tensions.
