Tanisha Anderson's family files lawsuit against Cleveland police

The family of Tanisha Anderson has filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against the city of Cleveland.

The suit, filed Wednesday, names Cleveland Division of Police officers Scott Aldridge and Bryan Myers as the two who responded to Anderson's house Nov. 13 and ultimately caused her death.

The family accuses the city and the officers of excessive force, wrongful death, assault and battery and violating the Americans with Disabilities Act. It is asking for a jury trial and an unnamed amount in damages.

Anderson, an East High School graduate, has been held up by protestors as an example of police violence alongside Tamir Rice, Michael Brown and Eric Garner, among others.

Mike DeWine's office may play role in Tamir Rice probe
