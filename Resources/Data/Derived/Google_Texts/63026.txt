HARTFORD — Connecticut has its lowest percentage of people without health care coverage ever, according to Lt. Gov. Nancy Wyman and Access Health CT.

Access Health, the state's Obamacare exchange, said 3.8 percent of Connecticut residents, or 137,000 people, are without any form of health insurance.

The U.S. Census reported in September that the number of uninsured Connecticut residents fell sharply in 2014, by 85,000 to 245,000, or 6.9 percent. That was down from 9.4 percent in 2013.

The Census number is the lowest figure it has reported in at least 20 years, and Access Health said its number — determined through an analysis of 2015 coverage by Acturus of Farmington — is an all-time low.

Both show steep declines since the start of the state exchanges under the Affordable Care Act, and both show that Connecticut has among the lowest uninsured rates.

But what's the right number?

Calculating the number of people without health insurance has always been difficult because families are often in flux, changing plans and moving in and out of Medicaid eligibility, for example. The Census survey asks whether people have had insurance at any time during the current year, while other surveys ask whether they are currently covered.

The Acturus number was not based on a survey, but rather on a wide collection of data from different sources, combined. It shows, for example, that 56 percent of state residents, or 2 million people, have coverage through an employer-sponsored plan — derived by subtracting all the other sources from the state's population and comparing that to a Kaiser Family Foundation number.

The Census figure for Connecticut in 2014, which was released last month, mirrored a national decline of 8.8 million people in 2014, as the uninsured rate reached 10.4 percent across the country in the first year of state exchanges and subsidies for individual customers.

Massachusetts, which instituted a public exchange for health insurance in 2006, had the lowest uninsured rate in the country in 2014, at 3.3 percent, according to the Census. After Massachusetts, only Vermont, Hawaii, Minnesota and Iowa had more of their population covered than Connecticut.

Acturus said the rate was 8 percent in 2012.

"Over the past several years we've established our leadership on health care," said Wyman, the Access Health CT chairwoman, in a press release. She pointed to the state's "high-functioning, now self-sustaining exchange" and the fact that more residents have access to presentative care and treatment for chronic illness.

"There is more to do, but this progress means a healthier and more productive state," Wyman said.

Following is the breakdown of coverage in Connecticut, according to the Acturus report:

EMPLOYER-SPONSORED: 56 percent (2 million)

MEDICAID: 21 percent (760,758)

MEDICARE: 14 percent (522,587)

INDIVIDUAL: 4.6 percent (166,933)

MILITARY/VA: 0.8 percent (29,416)

UNINSURED: 3.8 percent (137,000)
