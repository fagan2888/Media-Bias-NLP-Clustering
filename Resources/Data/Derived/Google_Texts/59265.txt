Street Fighter’s Ryu is coming to Super Smash Bros., Nintendo announced Sunday.

“He’s being created to most closely resemble his Street Fighter II form,” Super Smash Bros. director Masahiro Sakurai said in a video from Nintendo. “In that game there were six buttons, but Smash focuses on two.”

To remedy that, different attacks can be made depending on how long the player presses and holds the button. A tap produces a light but fast attack, while holding it down creates a slower, more powerful one. As in Street Fighter, there are light, medium and strong attacks.

Ryu’s signature moves — the hadouken, shoryuken and hurricane kick — are included in the game. If the player uses the original Street Fighter button command, it produces a more powerful version of each attack. Ryu is also the first character in Super Smash Bros. to have two final smashes.

Nintendo is also including Suzaku Castle as a new stage, along with Ryu’s and Ken’s theme songs from Street Fighter.
