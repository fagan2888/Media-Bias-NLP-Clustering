Then came a letter from her insurance company earlier this year.\n\n\u201cI was quite sure I must not be reading it correctly,\u201d she said. But she was: Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas was indeed discontinuing her Preferred Provider Organization plan, meaning that continuing treatment at MD Anderson Cancer Center is about to become alarmingly expensive.\n\nPPO plans give patients flexibility to choose almost any doctor or hospital without risking major financial penalties for going out-of-network. But they are an endangered species on the Affordable Care Act\u2019s 2016 exchanges.\n\nRelated: Obamacare premiums and deductibles going up \u2013 but it's still better than before\n\nThere are no PPOs being offered via the federal marketplace in 2016 in Houston, the country\u2019s fourth-largest city, or in New Jersey and New York. An analysis of silver-level Obamacare PPO plans by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation noted that only a third of this year\u2019s offerings will stay the same in 2016, with many carriers exiting the market, dropping their plans or reducing their availability.\n\nUnitedHealth, the country\u2019s largest health insurer, said on Thursday that it is considering leaving the exchanges in 2017 because of what its CEO described as unsustainable losses.\n\n\u201cI think the carriers have lost money on the exchanges in general but lost money in particular with PPOs and I think the thing that\u2019s been the biggest problem for them is allowing people to have access to out-of-network providers,\u201d said Kathy Hempstead, director of coverage issues at the Foundation.\n\nThe bigger the city, of course, the more providers there are. And Hempstead theorized that when the Affordable Care Act was introduced, companies were under pressure to grab a big share of the market so offered attractive plans that have proved unprofitable.\n\n\u201cSince the Affordable Care Act began, the market has changed. We found that the individual PPO plan was no longer sustainable at the cost it was being offered. Because we want to make sure that our plans are affordable, we decided to not offer individual PPO plans in 2016,\u201d Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas said on its website.\n\nThe company says it has case management programs to help with the transition to Health Maintenance Organization plans. These typically do not cover out-of-network visits and require non-emergency care to be coordinated through a primary care physician.\n\n\u201cFor a lot of people it\u2019s not going to matter that much,\u201d said Hempstead, adding that most customers care more about price than choice. However, she said: \u201cFor some people it\u2019s going to be a problem.\u201d\n\nFor many, changing plans will bring little more than inconvenience and perhaps an obligation to find a new doctor. But for families with complex needs, the loss of a PPO presents an agonising choice: risk financial hardship or settle for potentially inferior care.\n\nMoore was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2008 and underwent a double mastectomy. Earlier this year she discovered she had thyroid cancer and had half her thyroid removed. She requires regular check-ups and wants to continue going to MD Anderson, but the replacement plan she has found with a local healthcare system, her sole PPO option, would cover only 50% of the costs. \u201cIt will add up quickly,\u201d she said.\n\nMoore\u2019s form of breast cancer, triple negative, is hard to treat if it recurs. She would feel more confident about the quality of her care at MD Anderson, the nation\u2019s top-ranked cancer hospital according to US News & World Report. \u201cThey are going to be the ones who are most likely to know of some innovative thing,\u201d she said.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Moore and her husband, Ricky, together pay $1,500 a month for their soon-defunct plan, which will rise to $1,600 for the new, more restrictive, scheme. Photograph: Linda Moore\n\nMoore and her husband, Ricky, together pay $1,500 a month for their soon-defunct plan, which will rise to $1,600 for the new, more restrictive, scheme. It will be about $400 a month to cover their daughter, Sarah, who goes to MD Anderson because she has atypical moles, a risk factor for melanoma.\n\nLinda Moore, 56, gave up her job as a teacher to care for Sarah, who has a string of serious health problems and is aged 25 but functions like an 18-month old. In 2012, Ricky had to quit his career as a construction manager when he developed a blood clot. That meant the 54-year-old lost his health insurance and the family had to turn to the federal exchange.\n\nThe family are clients of Jason Bohmann, a broker with Texas Health Design. He said he receives three or four calls a day from people wondering how to handle the loss of their PPO. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of fear out there,\u201d he said, adding that the price of HMOs is rising.\n\n\u201cIn 2016 you\u2019re going to pay exactly the same for an inferior network that may have 40% or 30% of the doctors you had last year,\u201d he said. \u201cMore inconvenience, less choice, all for the same money. Doesn\u2019t sound like a good deal.\u201d\n\nFor Linda Moore, one of the jewels of the largest medical complex in the world is suddenly so near yet so far.\n\n\u201c[I was] needing the innovation of MD Anderson, always being grateful that I happen to live in the town where MD Anderson is, and now like so many people who live in the town I\u2019m not going to be able to go to the place unless I really want to dip into my savings, cash out my 401(k), that kind of thing,\u201d she said. \u201cI could always go to an in-network oncologist and maybe things will go well; I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nInstinctively risk-averse, for the first time in her life she is considering going without coverage to avoid having to dip into her retirement savings to cover regular healthcare costs. In other words, gambling that she will not fall seriously ill again.\n\n\u201cJust don\u2019t go the doctor. Don\u2019t do those preventative care visits that probably helped me find out I had breast cancer and thyroid cancer early on. Just don\u2019t find out and don\u2019t get it fixed,\u201d she said. \u201cWhich is ludicrous but at this point what do you do? It becomes insanely expensive, it\u2019s a whole different ball game from what it used to be.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#005689", "description": "PPO plans give patients flexibility to choose almost any doctor or hospital but they are an endangered species on the Affordable Care Act\u2019s 2016 exchanges", "application-name": "The Guardian", "author": "Tom Dart", "og": {"site_name": "the Guardian", "description": "PPO plans give patients flexibility to choose almost any doctor or hospital but they are an endangered species on the Affordable Care Act\u2019s 2016 exchanges", "title": "Texas family struggles to keep health insurance \u2013 and survive cancer", "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/nov/22/obamacare-ppo-plan-texas-health-insurance-cancer-treatment", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0b01243a0f5a24f64fac3e130c82d4825e5ebf6/176_585_4563_2740/master/4563.jpg?w=1200&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=884c7e896d90b69189383b1ba8f7466b", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://us-news/2015/nov/22/obamacare-ppo-plan-texas-health-insurance-cancer-treatment?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/nov/22/obamacare-ppo-plan-texas-health-insurance-cancer-treatment", "iphone": "gnmguardian://us-news/2015/nov/22/obamacare-ppo-plan-texas-health-insurance-cancer-treatment?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}, "id": {"ipad": 409128287, "iphone": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"ipad": "The Guardian", "googleplay": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}}, "site": "@guardian", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/a0b01243a0f5a24f64fac3e130c82d4825e5ebf6/176_585_4563_2740/master/4563.jpg", "creator": "@Tom_Dart"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://us-news/2015/nov/22/obamacare-ppo-plan-texas-health-insurance-cancer-treatment?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "theme-color": "#005689", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/f06f6996e193d1ddcd614ea852322d25/windows_tile_144_b.png", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "US healthcare,Health,Health policy,Obama administration,Texas", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "published_time": "2015-11-22T12:00:02.000Z", "author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/tom-dart", "section": "US news", "modified_time": "2015-11-22T14:53:15.000Z", "tag": "US healthcare,Health,Health policy,Obama administration,Texas"}, "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0b01243a0f5a24f64fac3e130c82d4825e5ebf6/176_585_4563_2740/4563.jpg?w=620&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=e4124258f2b028d081b85917a00a2e42", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "US healthcare,Health,Health policy,Obama administration,Texas"}, "article_summary": "We found that the individual PPO plan was no longer sustainable at the cost it was being offered.\nPPO plans give patients flexibility to choose almost any doctor or hospital without risking major financial penalties for going out-of-network.\nDon\u2019t do those preventative care visits that probably helped me find out I had breast cancer and thyroid cancer early on.\nBut she was: Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas was indeed discontinuing her Preferred Provider Organization plan, meaning that continuing treatment at MD Anderson Cancer Center is about to become alarmingly expensive.\nBecause we want to make sure that our plans are affordable, we decided to not offer individual PPO plans in 2016,\u201d Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas said on its website."}
