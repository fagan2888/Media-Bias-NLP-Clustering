The program requires that enrollees pay for a portion of their healthcare costs, does not cover all of the procedures that traditional Medicaid typically covers, and limits the total number of participants. Approximately 37,000 residents are enrolled in the program and 53,000 are backlogged on a waiting list, The Courier-Journal reports. A full Medicaid expansion under Obamacare would cover as many as 400,000 enrollees. But Pence says that capping costs keeps them low and encourages enrollees to make smarter choices about their healthcare.\n\nIndiana also opted out of opening a healthcare exchange market on Oct. 1.\n\nFollow Katie on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Katie McHugh", "description": "Mike Pence calls exemption victory for 'consumer-driven healthcare'", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "The federal government granted Indiana a year-long Obamacare waiver on Tuesday, allowing the state to continue to run its own Medicaid pilot program, The Washington Post reports.
