(AP) - Have you ever tried to count how many jelly beans are in a jar for a contest? How would you solve it?\n\nMaybe you would guess a number. Others might try to visually count the jelly beans they see. An even smaller percentage would probably try to mathematically calculate the answer to this classic problem.\n\nToday, contest participants can easily solve this question with a well-educated guess as to the jar\u2019s dimensions and a smartphone or computer to plug those numbers into an equation published on the vCalc website.\n\nVCalc is a free website designed to help people find and compute solutions to everyday math and science problems.\n\nIt allows users to access equations and online calculators in one place so they can solve complex problems, like how to build a house, as well as simpler ones, such as the number of jelly beans in a jar.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re sparing them from entering big, ugly equations . (and) big, ugly numbers (into a physical calculator),\u201d said Kurt Heckman, president and founder of vCalc, referring to the website as a one-stop shop.\n\nHeckman founded vCalc LLC, which is headquartered in downtown Frederick, about 2 1/2 years ago. It began as an online forum where people like Heckman, who understood math, could post equations, calculators and constants they found helpful for others to use, he said.\n\nAt first, the website was geared more toward engineering, science and math with posts about how to determine the speed of an aircraft or convert measurements from nanometers to inches, Heckman said.\n\nToday, the website has evolved into a more open and varied learning space where anyone can post and use tools for all kinds of everyday problems, ranging from construction to chemistry, he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of like a Wikipedia model in that people who understand a topic can come in and add this and make it free to the public,\u201d Heckman said. There is a process to review and verify published content.\n\nThe idea for vCalc stemmed from Heckman\u2019s experience working as an aerospace engineer. He noticed that careless arithmetic could lead to inaccurate results, a problem easily resolved by creating an online platform where users could input numbers and receive answers without computing, he said.\n\n\u201cI was constantly building mathematical tools for people doing their day jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes it was crazy high tech like flying a satellite and sometimes it was literally adding up numbers on a balance sheet for a bank.\u201d\n\nToday, Heckman is looking to expand the website\u2019s content to reach a broader audience, including students, he said.\n\nHeckman and the roughly half dozen vCalc employees in Frederick will work with students and professors from St. Mary\u2019s College this summer to develop college-level math formulas and data for the website. As of mid-March, the website had more than 8,000 equations published, according to Heckman.\n\nThis project is funded by a $97,000 grant from the Maryland Industrial Partnerships Program (MIPS), the second time vCalc has worked with a college on the website using a grant from this program.\n\nIn 2014, vCalc partnered with computer science faculty and students from Frostburg University to build equations and sets of constants for the website\u2019s calculator application through a MIPS grant.\n\nHeckman said the firm will continue to search and apply for grants, but vCalc is largely funded by his personal investment and those of others. Several million dollars have already been invested, he said.\n\n\u201cWe think we have this distinct possibility to be a multi-billion-dollar industry,\u201d Heckman said. \u201cI mean, we\u2019re being found all over the world right now without really trying very hard.\u201d\n\nThe website receives a large amount of traffic each month, including visitors from more than 100 countries, according to Heckman.\n\n\u201cAnd just like you don\u2019t go search the Internet (but) you go Google things, we want to become a verb,\u201d he said. \u201cWe hope five years from now, people, if they\u2019re rubbing two numbers together, they say, \u2018Go vCalc.\u2019 And the market\u2019s there. Math is in everything.\u201d\n\nHeckman said he believes vCalc will grow significantly in the next year. The company already has employees in Kenya and Estonia who manage and develop the website and provide tech support.\n\nDina Yagodich, an associate professor of mathematics at Frederick Community College, said vCalc could be a useful educational tool, particularly for students looking to check their homework.\n\n\u201cTools like this, if used well by students, can actually enhance their learning,\u201d Yagodich said.\n\nVCalc could be detrimental for students learning basic algebra and computation, but for advanced students, Yagodich said this helps them check their work and prepare for quizzes and tests.\n\nIt also allows them to seek help from another source, instead of from her, Yagodich said. Now when students approach her for help, she said it\u2019s typically for the more complicated, abstract questions.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019d rather have them ask for help on,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s the best use of their time and my time.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Frederick (Md.)
