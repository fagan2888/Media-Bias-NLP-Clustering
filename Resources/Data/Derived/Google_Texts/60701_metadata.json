About 3,330 passengers had stayed overnight in the terminals.\n\nIn California, four people died of hypothermia in the San Francisco Bay Area while the region was gripped by freezing temperatures.\n\nFreezing rain and sleet are likely again Saturday night in Memphis, Nashville and other areas of Tennessee before the storm starts surging northeast. Virginia officials warned residents of a major ice storm likely to take shape Sunday, resulting in power outages and hazards on the roads.\n\n\u201cIt looks like we\u2019re going to be stuck with this for one, two, maybe three days,\u201d said Memphis attorney Sam Chafetz, who was going home early to enjoy some bourbon-soaked sweet potatoes left over from Thanksgiving.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of the ice and snow, I\u2019m afraid of the other drivers who don\u2019t know how to drive in it,\u201d Chafetz said.\n\nThe weather forced the cancellation of Sunday\u2019s Dallas Marathon, which was expected to draw 25,000 runners, some of whom had trained for months.\n\nMeanwhile, around 7 inches of snow fell in northeast Arkansas and the Missouri boot heel, according to the National Weather Service in Memphis. Ice accumulated on trees and power lines in Memphis and the rest of West Tennessee after layers of sleet fell throughout the region Friday. The weather service says 8 to 9 inches fell in parts of southern Indiana.\n\nThe storm dumped a foot of snow and more in some areas of Illinois, with police scrambling to respond to dozens of accidents and forced scores of schools to remain closed.\n\nWestern and central Kentucky were under winter storm warnings slated to last through early Saturday. With warmer temperatures expected in eastern Kentucky, forecasters issued a flood watch into Saturday morning.\n\nLooking ahead, the National Weather Service says a wind chill advisory is in effect for parts of northeast Arkansas and the Missouri boot heel. Forecasters say wind chill readings between zero and minus-5 degrees may occur.\n\nShipping giant FedEx, which has its worldwide hub in Memphis, was monitoring the situation with its team of meteorologists, company spokesman Scott Fielder said. Delivery delays may occur in areas where the storm caused unsafe driving and flying conditions, he warned.\n\nIce had built up on the windshields and roofs of parked cars throughout Memphis into Saturday. Law enforcement reported an increase in traffic crashes, and scattered power outages affected more than 3,000 people, emergency and utility officials said.\n\nResidents were told to prepare for a few days without power, prompting them to rush to stores to stock up on groceries, buy electricity generators and gas up their cars. Shelby County Mayor Mark Luttrell reminded residents to check on family and friends who are elderly, disabled or live alone.\n\nIn Nashville, organizers canceled the Christmas parade. The annual St. Jude Memphis Marathon, scheduled for Saturday, was canceled as well.\n\nSleet also fell in Dyer County, Tenn., where one shelter was on standby and farmers worked to protect crops and livestock.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still getting a lot of sleet falling and roads are slushy and kind of slick,\u201d said James Medling, emergency management director for Dyer County.\n\nPolice in Arlington, about 20 miles west of Dallas, reported one driver was killed when his car slammed into a truck. Authorities in Oklahoma reported two weather-related traffic deaths.\n\nStorms this week had already dumped 1 to 2 feet of snow in parts of Minnesota and Wisconsin and draped many communities in skin-stinging cold. The temperature in parts of North Dakota on Thursday was a few degrees below zero, but wind chill pushed it to nearly 40 below.\n\n\u2022 Associated Press writer Jamie Stengle contributed to this report from Dallas.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Millions hunkered down for icy conditions expected to last through the weekend from Texas to Ohio to Tennessee as the cold snap that covered much of the nation knocked out power and made roads treacherous Saturday.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Millions hunkered down for icy conditions expected to last through the weekend from Texas to Ohio to Tennessee as the cold snap that covered much of the nation knocked out power and made roads treacherous Saturday.", "title": "Snow storm sucker punch: U.S. hit by winter wave", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/dec/7/snow-storm-sucker-punch-much-us-hit-winter-wave/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/12/06/cold-snap-oregonjpeg-0df13.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/12/06/cold-snap-oregonjpeg-0df13.jpg", "description": "Millions hunkered down for icy conditions expected to last through the weekend from Texas to Ohio to Tennessee as the cold snap that covered much of the nation knocked out power and made roads treache", "card": "summary", "title": "Snow storm sucker punch: U.S. hit by winter wave"}, "Author": "Adrian Sainz", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Disaster Accident, Weather, National Weather Service In Memphis"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfd7f\"", "article_summary": "Meanwhile, around 7 inches of snow fell in northeast Arkansas and the Missouri boot heel, according to the National Weather Service in Memphis.\nFreezing rain and sleet are likely again Saturday night in Memphis, Nashville and other areas of Tennessee before the storm starts surging northeast.\nIce accumulated on trees and power lines in Memphis and the rest of West Tennessee after layers of sleet fell throughout the region Friday.\nStorms this week had already dumped 1 to 2 feet of snow in parts of Minnesota and Wisconsin and draped many communities in skin-stinging cold.\nVirginia officials warned residents of a major ice storm likely to take shape Sunday, resulting in power outages and hazards on the roads."}
