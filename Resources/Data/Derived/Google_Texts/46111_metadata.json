He said that the government simply views the Little Sisters as not religious enough to be given the same pass on the mandate that churches have been granted.\n\nBlomberg charged that there\u2019s \u201creligious discrimination\u201d at play when the government acts as though a religious group like the Little Sisters isn\u2019t faithful enough, so the Little Sisters are joining other Christian groups to ask the Supreme Court to settle the matter once and for all.\n\n\u201cThey are seeking relief from a 100-page decision by the Tenth Circuit that disagrees with the ministries\u2019 understanding of moral theology,\u201d read a Thursday a press release from the Becket Fund. \u201c[The] petition is the fifth the Court has received and makes it likely the Court will decide in the upcoming term whether religious ministries, like religious for-profits, will receive protection from the mandate.\u201d\n\nThe government set new rules for its contraceptive mandate after the Supreme Court\u2019s 5 to 4 decision in June 2014 that \u201cclosely held corporations\u201d like Hobby Lobby could be exempt from the mandate if their owners have opposition to these drugs. But those rules have not been seen by many groups as being disconnected enough from employers to make them feel comfortable with the amendments.\n\nThe Little Sisters could face fines of up to $2.5 million per year if they refuse to comply and are not granted a permanent relief from the rules, the National Catholic Register reported.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has previously stepped in twice to offer temporary protection to the sisters.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "The national debate over the Affordable Care Act appears nowhere near over, as the Little Sisters of the Poor\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a Roman Catholic group of nuns who run nursing homes around the globe \u2014 continue their battle against the law's contentious contraceptive mandate.
