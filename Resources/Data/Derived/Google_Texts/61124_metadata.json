He is the lone officer among the 13 who fired their weapons that night who is charged criminally because prosecutors say he stood on the hood and opened fire four seconds after the other officers had stopped shooting.\n\nA judge \u2014 not a jury \u2014 will decide whether Brelo is guilty or innocent. He faces a maximum sentence of 25 years if convicted.\n\nBrelo\u2019s defense team has argued that all 49 rounds Brelo fired that night, including the last 15, were lawful and that the threat didn\u2019t end until Brelo reached into the Malibu and removed the keys, preventing the suspects from using the car as a weapon. Russell and Williams were each shot more than 20 times.\n\nRegardless of the trial\u2019s outcome, the after-effects of the chase and shooting will likely endure for years to come.\n\nThe incident helped spur a U.S. Justice Department probe that concluded Cleveland police officers have shown a pattern and practice of using excessive force. The city and federal authorities are negotiating a consent decree to reform the police department that will cost the city millions of dollars to implement and enforce. Cleveland has already paid $3 million to the families of Russell and Williams to settle a lawsuit.\n\nThe chase started with a failed traffic stop on the edge of downtown by a plainclothes detective who never reported to dispatchers that he\u2019d lost sight of the vehicle. Russell then sped past Cleveland police headquarters, where his car backfired. Officers and witnesses standing outside were certain they\u2019d heard gunshots and a police radio call for shots fired triggered an adrenaline-fueled rush by officers to join the chase.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Indicted cop can\u2019t recall shooting suspects from hood of car", "title": "Indicted cop can\u2019t recall shooting suspects from hood of car", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Indicted cop can\u2019t recall shooting suspects from hood of car", "title": "Indicted cop can\u2019t recall shooting suspects from hood of car", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/04/05/indicted_cop_cant_recall_shooting_suspects_from_hood_of_car/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/cleveland-police-shooting.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Indicted cop can\u2019t recall shooting suspects from hood of car", "title": "Indicted cop can\u2019t recall shooting suspects from hood of car", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/cleveland-police-shooting.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Mark Gillispie", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce5c3\"", "article_summary": "Regardless of the trial\u2019s outcome, the after-effects of the chase and shooting will likely endure for years to come.\nCleveland has already paid $3 million to the families of Russell and Williams to settle a lawsuit.\nRussell then sped past Cleveland police headquarters, where his car backfired.\nThe incident helped spur a U.S. Justice Department probe that concluded Cleveland police officers have shown a pattern and practice of using excessive force.\nRussell and Williams were each shot more than 20 times."}
