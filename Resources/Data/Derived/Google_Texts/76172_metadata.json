The debacle\u2019s scale has surprised even progressives who supported the Affordable Care Act. After all, surely three and a half years provided ample time to prepare for a program President Obama calls his \u201cmost important initiative.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nSix weeks ago, Obama privately conceded to his advisers, according to the New York Times, \u201cwe created this problem we didn\u2019t need to create \u2026 and it\u2019s of our own doing.\u201d\n\nSo how did it happen? Here\u2019s one theory, backed by new data: not enough meetings.\n\nAmid the Obama administration\u2019s endless rounds of finger-pointing and blame-shifting, scant if any attention has been paid to the amount of time and executive leadership the president personally devoted to implementing his signature legislative achievement.\n\n\u201cNothing frustrates me more than when people aren\u2019t doing their jobs,\u201d Obama has said. So, with so much riding on the line, one would assume he held weekly, if not daily, one-on-one meetings with his Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Kathleen Sebelius to isolate problems, challenge assumptions, apply executive pressure where needed and successfully manage a project of scale.\n\nNope.\n\nThat did not happen, at least not according to Obama\u2019s own official White House calendar.\n\nA new Government Accountability Institute (GAI) analysis finds that from July 12, 2010, to Nov. 30, 2013, the president\u2019s public schedule records zero one-on-one meetings between Obama and Sebelius. Equally shocking, over the same period, the president's calendar lists 277 private meetings with his other Cabinet secretaries (excluding full Cabinet meetings).\n\nGiven these startling findings, and the fact that the White House calendar did not reflect meetings prior to July 12, 2010, GAI researchers then performed a second analysis using another respected recorder of presidential activity, the POLITICO presidential calendar. The results: Just one April 21, 2010 entry was found listing a White House meeting between Obama and Sebelius\u2014and even that was a joint meeting with then Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner.\n\nThe eye-opening calendar findings shed new light on some of the curiously worded statements Obama has uttered in the aftermath of the calamitous HealthCare.gov launch. For example, at his Nov. 14 press conference, the president said:\n\n\u201cI was not informed directly that the website would not be working as\u2014the way it was supposed to. Had I been informed, I wouldn\u2019t be going out saying, \u2018Boy, this is going to be great.\u2019 You know, I\u2019m accused of a lot of things, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m stupid enough to go around saying, \u2018this is going to be like shopping on Amazon or Travelocity,\u2019 a week before the website opens, if I thought that it wasn\u2019t going to work. So, clearly, we and I did not have enough awareness about the problems in the website.\u201d\n\nOf course, we now know that contractors had, in fact, notified Sebelius months prior that serious problems persisted and that time was running out for proper testing. However, if Obama was not meeting regularly one-on-one with his HHS secretary to help navigate his signature legislative achievement safely into harbor, it\u2019s hard to discern exactly what the president knew and when he knew it.\n\nTo be sure, presidents exchange emails and phone calls that are not recorded on White House calendars. Still, why would the White House calendar list by name one-on-one meetings with 16 other Cabinet secretaries but omit Sebelius if other meetings with her occurred? Wouldn\u2019t Obama want to catalog for all to see his personal devotion to the law that bears his name? Perhaps the insular White House team wanted to distance the president from the bureaucratic process in the hopes of granting him a halo of deniability if the launch failed. Or perhaps the lack of meetings reinforces the severity of what the New York Times describes as the \u201cdeeply dysfunctional relationship between the Department of Health and Human Services and its technology contractors, and tensions between the White House chief of staff and senior health department officials.\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s critics say his loner style makes him unusually uninterested in working with other politicians. The president's closest advisers, like Valerie Jarrett, say the problem is Obama \u201cknows exactly how smart he is\u201d and has \u201cbeen bored to death his whole life. He\u2019s just too talented to do what ordinary people do. He would never be satisfied with what ordinary people do.\u201d Obama says the trait he deplores most in himself is that \u201cthere\u2019s a laziness in me.\u201d\n\nWhatever the cause, the launch of HealthCare.gov will go down in the annals of executive management as a case study of failure. Obama must answer for his absence of leadership.\n\n***\n\nUPDATE: The White House\u2019s response to the GAI calendar investigation is absurd and alarming.\n\nPress Secretary Jay Carney said Friday, \u201cCabinet secretaries don\u2019t regularly get entered into the visitor logs.\u201d The GAI report was not based on visitor logs; it was based on the White House\u2019s own calendar and the POLITICO presidential calendar.\n\nObama's calendar lists 277 one-on-one meetings between the president and his other Cabinet secretaries, including 73 with former Secretary Clinton and 57 with former Secretary Geithner. If, as Carney claims, Secretary Sebelius \u201cis here a lot and meets with the president with regularity,\u201d why aren\u2019t they listed? How many meetings took place and when did they occur? Carney said he doesn\u2019t know.\n\nAnd if Obama and Sebelius worked together closely and regularly, why did the president publicly state he did not know about the problems with HealthCare.gov?\n\nIn the name of transparency, Americans deserve to know how much time President Obama personally spent over three-and-a-half years leading, managing and working alongside Secretary Sebelius on his signature achievement.\n\nPeter Schweizer is president of the Government Accountability Institute, fellow at the Hoover Institution and author of Extortion: How Politicians Extract Your Money, Buy Votes, and Line Their Own Pockets.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO Magazine", "description": "Opinion: How did the botched Obamacare rollout happen?
