Not only are we welcoming a new life into the world, but we\u2019re also anticipating the many joys they\u2019ll bring, from their innocent laughter to their first bike ride later on. For Sacramento, Calif. parents Kirsti and Jason Kinkle, the birth of their daughter Kiira was different.\n\nA day after Kiiras birth on Oct. 12, doctors told her parents that she had a rare genetic skin condition known as recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB). The condition causes the skin to be extremely sensitive; a simple rub, scratch, or any sort of friction can cause the skin to break or blister. It\u2019s so rare that all forms of the condition affect only 6.5 per million children, according to the National Institutes of Health. \u201cA clothing tag or rough fabric or even me picking her up under her arm can cause blisters,\" Kirsti Kinkle told KCRA Sacramento. \"I can't hold her hand because it's constantly bandaged. There is no skin-to-skin contact.\"\n\nThere is currently no cure for RDEB, but the Kinkles say doctors at Stanford and the University of Minnesota are working on one. Until then, the only thing they can do is treat the symptoms young Kiira experiences every day. Unfortunately, this only means she\u2019s getting treatment for pain and itching, while her parents hope the bandages they wrap around each of her fingers and toes, as well as her hands and feet, will prevent the occurrence of any more blisters.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they get it,\u201d Jason Kinkle told KCRA, speaking about his two other daughters. \u201cThey pray every night her \u2018owies\u2019 go away, but I don\u2019t think they know the severity of it.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s particularly sad about all of this is that touch is one of the most important things parents can provide for a newborn. Studies have shown that physical touch reduces newborns\u2019 stress hormone levels, which in turn allows their brains to focus on other developmental processes, such as language and recognition of their own being.\n\nThe Kinkles hope that by exposing their story, they\u2019ll be able to raise awareness for the disease, which Kirsti says is the \u201cworst disease you\u2019ve never heard of.\u201d Through their website, KiiraKinkle.com, they\u2019re also hoping to raise money to assist in the $10,000 to $20,000 yearly cost of daily at-home treatments \u2014 their health insurance won\u2019t cover these expenses. They\u2019ve already raised over 90 percent of their $50,000 goal.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "rare, skin, disease, newborn, kiira, kinkle, makes, her, untouchable, physical, contact, easily", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Kiira Kinkle was born in October with a rare genetic skin disorder that makes her skin blister and break at the slightest touch.", "title": "Rare Genetic Disorder Easily Breaks Skin In Newborn Baby [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/rare-skin-disease-newborn-kiira-kinkle-makes-her-untouchable-physical-contact-easily-315130", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/21/kiira-kinkle.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Kiira Kinkle was born in October with a rare genetic skin disorder that makes her skin blister and break at the slightest touch.", "title": "Rare Genetic Disorder Easily Breaks Skin In Newborn Baby [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/rare-skin-disease-newborn-kiira-kinkle-makes-her-untouchable-physical-contact-easily-315130", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/21/kiira-kinkle.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/21/kiira-kinkle.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2014-12-21T10:58:45-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-21T11:00:31-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Kiira Kinkle was born in October with a rare genetic skin disorder that makes her skin blister and break at the slightest touch."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3e61\"", "article_summary": "\u201cA clothing tag or rough fabric or even me picking her up under her arm can cause blisters,\" Kirsti Kinkle told KCRA Sacramento.\nFor Sacramento, Calif. parents Kirsti and Jason Kinkle, the birth of their daughter Kiira was different.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they get it,\u201d Jason Kinkle told KCRA, speaking about his two other daughters.\nA day after Kiiras birth on Oct. 12, doctors told her parents that she had a rare genetic skin condition known as recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB).\nThe condition causes the skin to be extremely sensitive; a simple rub, scratch, or any sort of friction can cause the skin to break or blister."}
