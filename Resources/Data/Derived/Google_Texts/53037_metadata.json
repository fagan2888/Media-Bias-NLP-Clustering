Miller, a professor of food chemistry and nutrition at Cornell University.\n\nTwo factors influence the amount of iron that enters the diet, Miller said. First, iron tends to be much more soluble at high acidity, so more would be leached into a tomato sauce cooked in an iron pot than into an egg cooked in an iron skillet.\n\nSecond, iron leaching is a relatively slow process, so foods that take a long time to cook will get more iron from the vessel.\n\nAs for possible benefits, several studies have found a lower prevalence of iron deficiency in subjects whose food was cooked in iron pots compared with control subjects whose food was cooked in glass or Teflon-lined pots, Miller said.\n\nWhile some have suggested that increased iron consumption from cooking pots may put some people at risk of an overdose, other nutritionists note that only about 1 percent of Americans have iron overloads, compared with 6 percent who are iron deficient.\n\n\u2013 C.
