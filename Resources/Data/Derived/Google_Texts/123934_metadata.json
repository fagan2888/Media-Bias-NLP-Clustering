And it has an interesting twist to it that comes out as: \u201cDo you really think you can stand in the way of a development that provides economic growth for millions?\u201d\n\nThis is sort of a double whammy \u2013 one, you\u2019re too small and two, your rights and concerns are subservient to the \u201cgreater good.\u201d I\u2019m a citizen of the Seneca Nation and grew up during the struggle over the construction of Kinzua Dam in our southern territory of Allegany. I grew up with being told by the Americans that our nation is too small and our rights and interests will not stand in the way of their progress. We were subjected to this argument again when they decided to put Interstate 90 through our Cattaraugus Territory.\n\nSo yeah, I have sensitivity to these questions, but this time they spurred a different wondering about this never ending argument. And that wondering was about, who are the smallest nations that are members of the U.N.? And, as members, wouldn\u2019t they have the same sovereignty and powers as the bigger nations? And, as members, would it be so easy to trample on their rights and interests for the sake of \u201cprogress\u201d by one or more of the larger members?\n\nIronically, the U.N. is somewhat modeled after the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois Confederacy). In 1949, our chiefs and clan mothers were invited to participate in the laying of the cornerstone of the U.N. headquarters in New York City.\n\nOne of the hallmark principles in the formation of the Confederacy is stated as: \u201cAll heads are the same height.\u201d This means that all member nations are equal regardless of size of population or territory. It also means that the larger members have to pay due regard to the concerns and positions of the smaller members. The central way this is done is through the process of consensus \u2013 coming to \u201cOne Mind, One Heart.\u201d\n\nThis principle and process are the core elements of Haudenosaunee democracy and are in practice at every level of society. They are a key part of beliefs, practices and customs. So much so it can be argued they are embedded in our DNA and \u201cblood memory.\u201d We find it extremely offensive when someone suggests that we should take a subservient position simply because of our size.\n\nIn the course of researching the smallest nations I also came across what the U.N. calls the \u201cNon-Self Governing Territories\u201d and there are 17 of them. They are \u201cadministered\u201d by the U.S., Britain, France or New Zealand. Their status does bring them under U.N. scrutiny.\n\nHow their legal status is framed is very interesting. The ones under U.S. jurisdiction are defined as \u201cunincorporated, unorganized.\u201d Now there\u2019s a concept that harkens back to the Indian Reorganization Act. The British define those under their jurisdiction as \u201coverseas territories\u201d, which alludes to a sense of ownership such as the Falkland Islands issue. The French use the terms \u201coverseas collectivity\u201d or \u201cspecial collectivity.\u201d And New Zealand uses the term \u201cterritory\u201d implying that Tokelau is somehow part of their country.\n\nLooking at these 34 nations/territories has been an interesting exercise. There are some very interesting figures that emerge when these are compared to some of the Indigenous nations in North America.\n\nThe top five smallest member states of the U.N. \u2013 based on population and territory \u2013 are: 1. The Vatican, 0.2 square miles, population of 770, none of whom are permanent residents; 2. Monaco - 0.7 square miles, population 32,000; 3. Nauru - 8.5 square miles, population 13,000; 4. Tuvalu - 9 square miles, population 12,000; and 5. San Marino - 24 square miles, population 29,000. Combined, they have a total of 42.4 square miles of territory and a combined population of 86,770.\n\nThe top five Non-Self Governing Territories are: 1. Gibraltar, 2 square miles, population 29,752; 2. Tokelau, 5 square miles, population 1,411; 3. Pitcairn Islands, 14 square miles, population 50; 4. Bermuda, 22 square miles, population 62,000; and 5. Arguila, 37 square miles, population 14,108. Combined they have a total of 80 square miles of territory and a combined population of 107,321.\n\nBoth categories combine for a total of 122.4 square miles and 194,091 people. Even combining the territories and populations of all 34 nations/territories we come up with 118,918 square miles and 2.7 million people.\n\nThe largest small member state is Palau - 191 square miles and a population of 20,000. The largest Non-Self Governing is the disputed Western Sahara Territory with 102,703 square miles and an estimated population of 531,000.\n\nCompare these to the Navajo Nation which has a territory of over 27,400 square miles and a population of 300,048. The Haudenosaunee currently control 1,095 square miles of territory and has a population of 138,000. The combined territories of the Sioux Nation total more than 10 thousand square miles and a population of over 81,000. These three nations alone account for more than 38,495 square miles and a population of over 519,000.\n\nSo, where are our seats at the international tables?\n\nIn principle, they\u2019re sitting there waiting for us to occupy them. Therein lies the challenge \u2013 what do we need to do to be able to occupy those seats?\n\nTo begin with, we need a lot of de-colonizing of our thinking, our perceptions, our relations and our actions leading to the re-assertion of Indigenous nations and civilizations. For example, there are seven Ojibwe territories in northern Minnesota. Each has so-called \u201cmembership\u201d rules that come from the B.I.A. Not one of them has \u201ccitizenship\u201d criteria so the result is that there\u2019s an ever growing number of Ojibwe children who cannot be enrolled on any of the reservations because they don\u2019t have enough \u201cblood quantum\u201d from a particular Band. This is self erasure, self extermination.\n\nThen there are the thousands of \u201cborder children\u201d who aren\u2019t considered Indigenous because the settler governments do not recognize the Indigenous lineage of one of the parents.\n\nThere\u2019s political lip service paid to these issues, but there is no concerted effort to take the steps necessary to stop this form of self-imposed genocide. Countries don\u2019t have \u201cmembers\u201d, they have citizens \u2013 we\u2019re not a club.\n\nThere are examples all over Indian Country. Day after day people blindly perpetuating their oppression and colonization without stopping to question \u2013 where did this come from and why are we going along with it?\n\nUntil we make these liberating breakthroughs, our seats at the international tables will remain empty.\n\nMike Myers is the founder and CEO of Network for Native Futures, a Native non-profit that works with Indigenous nations, communities and organizations internationally.
