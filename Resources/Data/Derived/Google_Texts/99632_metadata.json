(AP) - New Hampshire\u2019s largest utility has started a training program for future workers that would enable them to be paid apprentices and get hands-on experience on various projects.\n\nStudents will work with Eversource to receive classroom instruction, online study and other experience.\n\nEversource says it also is committing to hiring New Hampshire workers first for contract work on major transmission and distribution projects, and to using non-union, New Hampshire-based companies for projects. The utility said the partnership helps address the critical need for qualified line workers as the utility industry sees a large portion of its workers retire.\n\nEversource said Tuesday it plans to invest more than $800 million in New Hampshire\u2019s grid in the next five years, in addition to pursuing approvals for the $1.4 billion Northern Pass Transmission project that would carry 1,200 megawatts of Canadian hydropower to power-hungry southern New England markets.\n\n\u201cThis one-of-a-kind partnership means that, for the first time in decades, we can put highly skilled electrical linemen and electricians to work in their home state,\u201d said Joe Casey, New Hampshire Building and Trades Council President for International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 490.
