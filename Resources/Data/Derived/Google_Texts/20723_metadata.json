The three-part \u201cpatient safety measure\u201d inspired close to $60 million in spending from the No side, seven times the spending on the Yes side. Medical malpractice insurers wanted to make sure this one went down \u2013 and early voter returns indicate that it will.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s apparent that people are being influenced by biased advertising,\u201d says Daniel G. Newman, president and co-founder of MapLight, a nonpartisan research organization that tracks the influence of money on politics. \u201cThese political ads have very little to do with the substance of the measure. They have very simple messaging that is often misleading.\u201d\n\nThe key piece of Prop. 46 would have adjusted the cap on medical malpractice awards for inflation, from $250,000 \u2013 an amount set in 1975 \u2013 to $1.1 million. This would have applied only to pain and suffering awards. Victims of medical malpractice, and their lawyers, pushed to raise the cap because they say it limits victims\u2019 ability to find representation, especially when that victim is elderly or a child and cannot claim lost wages or other economic damages. Insurers said this would drive up the costs of premiums.\n\nThe other two pieces of Prop. 46 focused more directly on doctors. The measure would have required doctors to check a statewide database of drug prescriptions before issuing new prescriptions for narcotics, and would have required them to undergo random drug and alcohol testing.\n\nRegardless of where voters\u2019 own economic and consumer interests fell, the majority voted no, says Newman, because of the flood of ads produced by the No side.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if you had a giant wall-sized TV screen on your left and a tiny cellphone screen on your right. And you as a voter are in the middle trying to make a decision,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be overwhelmingly influenced by the giant TV screen, or the side that spends an overwhelming amount of money.\u201d\n\nEarly polls for Prop. 46 showed strong support in favor \u2014 58 percent of likely voters said they would vote yes. That support dwindled after campaign ads began in earnest, and ultimately fizzled to about a third of voters by Election Day.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Medical malpractice insurers spent a lot to make sure 'patient-safety measure' was defeated.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Money a Huge Factor in Defeat of Proposition 46\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2014\\/11\\/04\\/money-a-huge-factor-in-proposition-46-race\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-11-04 23:30:16\",\"mod_date\":\"2014-11-10 09:50:36\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":22330,\"author_id\":\"3205\",\"author_name\":\"April Dembosky\",\"author_display_name\":\"April Dembosky\",\"tags\":[],\"categories\":[\"Policy\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2013\\/11\\/140007839-e1383845514894.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "Medical malpractice insurers spent a lot to make sure 'patient-safety measure' was defeated.", "title": "Money a Huge Factor in Defeat of Proposition 46", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2014/11/04/money-a-huge-factor-in-proposition-46-race/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2014/11/6737_transform.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca9bf\"", "article_summary": "46 would have adjusted the cap on medical malpractice awards for inflation, from $250,000 \u2013 an amount set in 1975 \u2013 to $1.1 million.\nMedical malpractice insurers wanted to make sure this one went down \u2013 and early voter returns indicate that it will.\nUpdate, 10:50 p.m.By far the most expensive race in the state this election was Proposition 46.\n46 showed strong support in favor \u2014 58 percent of likely voters said they would vote yes.\nThat support dwindled after campaign ads began in earnest, and ultimately fizzled to about a third of voters by Election Day."}
