Companies determine how much of a financial risk people pose based on their health and what services they need, Lefferts said. The idea of a risk adjustment plan is built into the Affordable Care Act, he said.\n\n\u201cThe idea behind risk adjustment is basically about balancing out. Every insurance company has a group of people that they cover, and those people have different levels of risk,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing now is we are working with the carriers to get as much information as we can from them to determine \u2026 their risk levels.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still getting data from the carriers,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019re still looking where that\u2019s going to end up.\u201d\n\nBlue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts, which has 2.8 million members nationwide, has approximately 3,000 members enrolled through the exchange, said Blue Shield spokeswoman Sharon Torgerson.\n\n\u201c[Blue Cross has] mostly individual non-group buyers enrolled through the exchange,\u201d she wrote in an email. \u201cThe vast majority of our individual and small group membership continues to buy directly from us.\u201d\n\nLefferts said the Health Connector will focus on making its website more user-friendly.\n\n\u201cWe know that we need improve our payment portal. We need to get in some functionality in the system, like putting someone on the coverage retroactively, or if they have a baby, adding someone to the policy,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want help [members] to have as good a time with customer experience as possible, so right now that\u2019s our top priority.\u201d\n\nIn addition to improving services, Lefferts said the Health Connector plans to target areas in the Commonwealth with higher rates of uninsured residents before the next open enrollment period in November.\n\n\u201cWe can really boil down to communities where those uninsured people are, and then go and really hit them hard with outreach during the next open enrollment, and capture some of the people who, for whatever reason, don\u2019t have health insurance,\u201d he said.\n\nSeveral residents said they support the ACA and appreciate that there is a push to get more people insured in Massachusetts.\n\nFrank Egloff, 67, of Jamaica Plain, said although he is not currently using insurance through the ACA, it is important to make it easier for people to get insured.\n\n\u201cI totally approve and am for it,\u201d he said. \u201cI support the Act, so whatever makes it happen is a good thing.\u201d\n\nAshley Donovan, 23, of Allston, said that the ACA is a good idea for people who can\u2019t have health insurance.\n\n\u201cIf something is terribly wrong with them and they can\u2019t pay for it, I think that they should get the healthcare that they need,\u201d she said. \u201cAt the same time, the fact that it\u2019s being taxed, [it\u2019s] one more thing that we have to pay for.\u201d\n\nDave Blasetti, 45, of Brighton, said that he does not believe the Act has been implemented well.\n\n\u201cThere [are] problems with the Health Connector, in Massachusetts in particular,\u201d he said. \u201cI wish it was going a little bit more smoothly than it actually seems to be doing, but the idea of having everybody insured is really good.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Following the conclusion of enrollment in the Massachusetts Health Connector, the program looks to implement risk a adjustment plan and evaluate services.", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Free Press", "description": "Following the conclusion of enrollment in the Massachusetts Health Connector, the program looks to implement risk a adjustment plan and evaluate services.", "title": "Health Connector to focus on service, risk adjustment", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1600, "identifier": "http://dailyfreepress.com/wp-content/uploads/Connector_-Betsey-original.jpg", "height": 1067}, "updated_time": "2015-04-16T05:28:04-04:00", "url": "http://dailyfreepress.com/2015/04/16/health-connector-to-evaluate-service-implement-risk-adjustment-plan/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Following the conclusion of enrollment in the Massachusetts Health Connector, the program looks to implement risk a adjustment plan and evaluate services.", "title": "Health Connector to focus on service, risk adjustment", "image": "http://dailyfreepress.com/wp-content/uploads/Connector_-Betsey-original.jpg", "creator": "@dailyfreepress", "site": "@dailyfreepress", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://dailyfreepress.com/wp-content/uploads/cropped-DFP_Lettering_Final-07-270x270.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/dailyfreepress/", "section": "City", "tag": "Sharon Torgerson", "published_time": "2015-04-16T05:05:18-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-16T05:28:04-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd11c4\"", "article_summary": "The Health Connector, an independent state agency that helps residents find health insurance coverage and avoid tax penalties, has 145,000 registrants for its insurance plan and 36,000registrants for dental insurance, said Jason Lefferts, spokesman for the Health Connector.\n\u201cThe vast majority of our individual and small group membership continues to buy directly from us.\u201dLefferts said the Health Connector will focus on making its website more user-friendly.\n\u201cThere [are] problems with the Health Connector, in Massachusetts in particular,\u201d he said.\nFollowing the conclusion of open enrollment in the Massachusetts Health Connector in mid-February, the program now looks forward to implementing a risk adjustment plan and evaluating online services.\n\u201cThe process of going onto the website and going on an application and finding out if you\u2019re eligible for Health Connector MassHealth and picking a plan has been pretty smooth.\u201dPeople are able to apply for specific health insurance programs and purchase the plan of their choosing through the Health Connector website."}
