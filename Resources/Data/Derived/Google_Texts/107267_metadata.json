She had been fired the previous morning from her minimum-wage job at Walgreens, just nine months after receiving Walgreens\u2019 employee of the month award.\n\nAfter getting fired, McGlochlin drove her 1995 Buick straight to Smoker Friendly, a tobacco retail store, to apply for another job. As a single mom with little savings and two young girls to support, she couldn\u2019t afford to wait.\n\n\u201cI filled out applications in my car,\u201d McGlochlin said. \u201cThe early bird gets the worm, right?\u201d\n\nNow, on a sunny but cool Thursday morning in April, McGlochlin, 26, needs to pick up some essentials for herself and her two young daughters before she continues her quest for a new job, possibly one that pays more than the minimum wage.\n\nShe said she\u2019s been applying to regular minimum-wage jobs, such as at UPS, but she really wants to work as a bookkeeper, a job for which she trained at Delta-Montrose Technical College.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just gonna knock on some doors until someone will give me a step up.\u201d\n\nDespite inaction at the federal level, city councils and state legislatures across the country are debating giving people like McGlochlin a step up.\n\nIn fact, Seattle earlier this month raised the city\u2019s minimum wage to $15 per hour, soon after the U.S. Senate blocked legislation that would have raised the national minimum to $10.10 from its current rate of $7.25. Colorado\u2019s minimum wage, which is indexed to inflation, increased slightly to $8 per hour in January.\n\nWith so much at stake for employers, workers and the state, economists are increasingly entering the fray. In January, the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank, released a letter to key U.S. policymakers with more than 600 signatures from economists in support of the Obama administration\u2019s proposal to raise the federal minimum wage to $10.10 by 2016. In April, a letter with more than 500 signatures from economists emerged, urging lawmakers to consider the economic consequences of raising the minimum wage.\n\nBoth letters included signatories from Colorado universities. And both sides in this debate cite empirical research and boast their fair share of Nobel laureates. But who\u2019s right?\n\nFor workers such as McGlochlin, struggling to raise a family, it doesn\u2019t matter who\u2019s right. They just need more money.\n\n$900 per month\n\nMcGlochlin budgets about $900 a month to support herself and her children.\n\nHer largest expense is food, on which she spends about $436 per month, $286 of that coming from the federal government\u2019s food stamp program. The other $150 comes out of her pocket.\n\nShe also makes weekly trips to Harvest of Hope to pick up a few key items for herself and her two daughters, 7 and 9.\n\n\u201cTwo-hundred eighty-six dollars in food stamps doesn\u2019t go very far for three people,\u201d McGlochlin said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how they expect me to feed them on that.\u201d\n\nMcGlochlin lives in a three-bedroom trailer in Boulder with her parents, her two brothers, 18 and 26, and her daughters. She pays her mother $300 rent for a single bedroom. Because McGlochlin needs a car to get to and from work \u2014 and to look for work when she needs more \u2014 she spends $25 per month on car insurance.\n\nShe receives health care benefits from Medicaid.\n\nMcGlochlin said the minimum wage should be raised, but she doesn\u2019t think that adding more benefits will help lower-income Americans. \u201cIf you throw more benefits into the system then you\u2019re just going to see more bloodsuckers,\u201d McGlochlin said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s tragic\u201d\n\nSanjai Bhagat, an economics professor at the University of Colorado at Boulder, signed the letter against raising the minimum wage. He believes that doing so will reduce employment, with low wage-earners bearing the brunt of the job cuts. \u201cLots of individuals are going to be unemployed because of this,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s tragic.\u201d\n\nJeffrey Zax, Bhagat\u2019s colleague in the CU-Boulder economics department, agrees that raising the minimum wage is bad economics. \u201cRaising the minimum wage is the kind of cosmetic improvement that satisfies many of us who aren\u2019t prepared to think very deeply about what it is we\u2019re doing,\u201d he said.\n\nOne of the principal arguments economists make against raising the minimum wage is that employers will react to the higher cost of labor by eliminating jobs or cutting back on workers\u2019 hours. Bhagat believes that increasing the minimum wage gives employers greater incentive to find ways to reduce labor costs, such as by investing in machinery that can do all or part of what a worker was being paid to do.\n\n\u201cWhen you raise the price of some input, companies use less of it,\u201d Bhagat said.\n\nDaniele Tavani, an economics professor at Colorado State University in Fort Collins, signed the letter in support of raising the minimum wage. \u201cA moderate increase of the kind proposed in the letter will have little, if any, aggregate employment effect in the country,\u201d he said. \u201cAn increase in the minimum wage would be of fundamental importance in lifting millions of households from poverty.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat didn\u2019t happen\u201d\n\nKayla, 25, and Aaron Vanderploeg, 28, still can\u2019t afford to live on their own while getting paid $10 per hour.\n\nKayla got her bachelor\u2019s degree in business, and her husband, Aaron, got his in youth ministry at Barclay College in Kansas. \u201cWe thought we would both just get jobs right away and be well off,\u201d Kayla said. \u201cThat didn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nKayla and Aaron graduated with $100,000 in debt between them. Neither has been able to find jobs using their degrees. They\u2019re not surprised that Aaron can\u2019t find a job in youth ministry. But Kayla was surprised she couldn\u2019t find a job.\n\nHer biggest hurdle: getting experience to qualify for a job.\n\nShe worked a minimum-wage job at Michaels during the Christmas season rush. Eventually, she was promoted to manager, and made $10.50 an hour. She had to quit that job because she had a baby, and day care would have cost her entire paycheck.\n\nNow, she works 18 hours a week at the Book Nook \u2014 an independently owned used book store in Louisville \u2014 for $10 an hour. Her boss lets her bring her baby into work. Her weekly salary covers her family\u2019s expenses. Aaron makes more than minimum wage as an electrician\u2019s apprentice, but his entire paycheck goes to paying off student loans.\n\nRight now, they have to live with her parents in Thornton just to make ends meet. They don\u2019t receive government assistance.\n\nKayla is torn on whether or not the minimum wage should be raised. On the one hand, she thinks of how much it would help her old co-workers at Michaels, most of whom Kayla said worked a second job after their 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. shift.\n\n\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t have to work two jobs anymore,\u201d she said.\n\nSome proponents for raising the minimum wage agree that, in theory, if you raise the cost of labor, you\u2019ll get less of it. However, CSU\u2019s Tavani and others believe that opponents of raising the minimum wage aren\u2019t seeing the whole picture.\n\nElissa Braunstein, a colleague of Tavani\u2019s in the economics department at CSU, believes that the current weak state of the economy needs to be taken into consideration. \u201cRight now, we are in a situation of deficient aggregate demand, stagnant incomes for most, and insufficient incomes for the poor,\u201d she said. \u201cIn that context, increasing the minimum wage will have more positive than negative effects.\u201d\n\nAccording to Tavani, those positive effects stem from the fact that low-income workers spend most of their income, which is good for businesses and economic growth. \u201cA minimum wage increase will boost consumption for the households affected, this way being potentially growth-enhancing without generating unemployment,\u201d he said.\n\nThe logic goes that as low-wage workers\u2019 incomes rise and they spend that income, businesses\u2019 sales rise as well, which more than offsets the increased cost of labor. \u201cThe most recent evidence, in my opinion, points toward beneficial effects of an increase in the minimum wage,\u201d Tavani said.\n\n\u201cI was livid\u201d\n\nBrilena McGlochlin\u2019s LinkedIn profile boasts of her bookkeeping and computer skills, and reminds potential employers of her training and education at Delta-Montrose. But the trail ends in 2009. The jobs at Subway, Burger King and Walgreens are apparently not worth mentioning on the online career site.\n\nYet those are the jobs she\u2019s been working. And keeping a minimum-wage job isn\u2019t easy.\n\nMcGlochlin has tried to improve her skill set in an attempt to make her more qualified for higher-paying jobs. Her ultimate goal is a bachelor\u2019s degree. \u201cI would really like to get my bachelor\u2019s degree and get something I deserve,\u201d she said, \u201cnot minimum wage.\u201d\n\nWhile she worked on her associate degree in 2007, McGlochlin\u2019s already strained marriage reached a breaking point when she came home and found her husband and his friend drunkenly shooting BB pellets in their studio apartment, she said, with their 2-year-old daughter in the room.\n\n\u201cI was livid,\u201d McGlochlin said.\n\nMcGlochlin pulled the gun from her husband\u2019s hands and \u201ckind of hit him\u201d with it. She said her husband then threw her through a window. She was charged with a felony: domestic abuse with a weapon.\n\nMcGlochlin and her husband have since split, and she has a restraining order against him. She said he still owes her $7,000 in child support. Now, McGlochlin can\u2019t get a job anywhere that does not require a background check, which is pretty much any job that would use her degree. She also can\u2019t rent anywhere that requires a background check \u2014 if she could even afford it.\n\nConsensus emerges\n\nSince 2011, the University of Chicago Booth School of Business has been polling economists from top U.S. universities on the economic effects of everything from immigration to paying college athletes.\n\nIn February 2013, they asked their panel of economic experts about the effects of raising the federal minimum wage to $9 per hour. On the question of whether it would make it harder for low-skilled workers to find employment, the panel was split, with 34 percent agreeing and 32 percent disagreeing. Especially telling was that 24 percent of respondents chose \u201cuncertain\u201d and none chose \u201cstrongly agree\u201d or \u201cstrongly disagree.\u201d\n\nIn February 2014, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released a report on the administration\u2019s minimum wage proposal that did little to settle the debate. Republicans highlighted the report\u2019s prediction that raising the federal minimum wage to $10.10 would reduce total employment by 500,000 workers by the second half of 2016. Democrats, on the other hand, pointed out that the report predicted 16.5 million low-wage workers would get a raise and 900,000 families would be lifted above the poverty line under the proposal.\n\nBut both statements from the CBO came with caveats: For example, 500,000 workers is the midpoint in a possible range from 0 to 1 million job losses.\n\nWhile the Booth School\u2019s polling and the CBO report seem to highlight the complexity of economics, there does seem to be some consensus emerging on the subject. When the Booth School asked its panel of economic experts if the benefits of raising the minimum wage (greater income for low-wage workers who can find employment) outweigh the potential costs (job losses for some low-wage workers), 47 percent of respondents agreed, with only 12 percent disagreeing.\n\nBut uncertainties remain. \u201cWe are bound with the available evidence, which is imperfect and noisy,\u201d said CSU\u2019s Tavani. \u201cEconomics is not, and never will be, a hard science.\u201d\n\n\u201cMore honor than that\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s nothing easy about living on minimum-wage work, and that\u2019s where government benefit programs often fill the gaps for so many people.\n\nFor her part, McGlochlin wants to wean herself from government benefits as soon as she can. Though she\u2019s twice needed help from Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (the primary \u201cwelfare\u201d program with which Americans are most familiar), she isn\u2019t getting TANF money now.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not enough for me. That\u2019s not enough for my girls. I want more for them,\u201d she said. \u201cLiving off assistance, it\u2019s part of the problem with our system. What am I showing them? If I\u2019m stealing from the system, what are they gonna turn out to be? I want them to have more honor than that.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy girls see me struggling, but they see me fighting a lot, too. I want them to grow up thinking they can accomplish anything they want.\u201d\n\nMcGlochlin understands and takes responsibility for her dilemma, and she understands she needs help, both from the government and places such as Harvest of Hope. \u201cI\u2019m only in the position I\u2019m in because life choices, life decisions, life mishaps have put me here,\u201d she said. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean that I wanna be here or that I wanna stay here.\u201d\n\nPaul McDivitt is a graduate student at the CU-Boulder.
