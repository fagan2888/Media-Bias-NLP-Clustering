Also the most important contribution of science to human welfare ever.\n\nDiscuss. But you\u2019re going to have to work hard to convince me otherwise. For a few of the reasons why contraception matters so much (to men as well as to women and children), consult economist Sonia Orrefice\u2019s recent post at The Conversation.\n\nHow to get free birth control\n\nThe government has just cracked down on insurance companies that haven\u2019t been providing free birth control products as required by the Affordable Care Act (aka ACA\u2013yes, the much-hated Obamacare.) The rules also apply way beyond Obamacare policies to other medical insurance policies, such as many offered by employers.\n\nThe US Department of Health and Human Services says insurance companies must offer women at least one of each of the 18 types of contraceptive options approved by the Food and Drug Administration. This includes not just the pill and intrauterine devices (IUDs) but also emergency (after-sex) contraception, sterilization, the patch, injectables, and other methods.\n\nThe right-wing Washington Times presents this news as just one more example of Obama\u2019s imperial overreach (\u201cHHS rewrites Obamacare rules: Orders free birth control for all\u201d.) But of course free birth control (not to mention other no-copay women\u2019s services) were always part of the ACA. The new regulations are simply very explicit about precisely what must be covered. The reason for such specificity is that a number of insurance companies have been weaseling out of that commitment.\n\nTimothy Jost has a brief list of the 18 approved methods at the HealthAffairs blog, with a link to the PDF detailed list. You can also get the list here.\n\nThe new regulations apply only to birth control methods for women. Male sterilization and condoms are FDA-approved but are not on Jost\u2019s list. If dependent children are covered on a woman\u2019s policy, the free contraceptive services are available to them, too. The government\u2019s detailed\u2013very detailed\u2013FAQ list is here.\n\nThe new regs don\u2019t necessarily mean that women will be able to get a specific contraceptive free. As Phil Galewitz explains at Shots, \u201cthe plans may still charge fees to encourage individuals to use a particular brand or generic. For example, a generic form might be free, while a brand-name version of the drug can include cost-sharing, HHS said.\u201d Also, the regulation doesn\u2019t go into effect until the new plan year, which in most cases means not until next January.\n\nHowever, a workaround from the government FAQs: \u201cIf an item or service is not covered but is determined medically necessary by the woman\u2019s attending provider, there must be an easily accessible process for the woman to get that item or service.\u201d\n\nGod is in the details. And you can be sure that religious opponents of birth control will be looking for Him there.\n\nThe most effective birth control method is an IUD\n\nThey work really well, but intrauterine devices (IUDs) are not all that popular. Sarah Kliff\u2019s Vox IUD FAQ notes that some of that foot-dragging is probably due to hangover bad press from the Dalkon Shield, an early \u201970s IUD that injured hundreds of thousands of women and killed some of them.\n\nToday\u2019s IUDs are quite safe and keep sperm away from eggs far more reliably than anything else except sterilization, which is permanent. Although fewer than 10% of US women use IUDs, 40% of gynecologists do. Which tells you something.\n\nThe IUD\u2019s great virtue is that it prevents pregnancy invisibly and automagically, but for only as long as the user wants it to prevent pregnancy. No daily pill, no weekly patch, no ducking into the bathroom to grease up and insert a diaphragm when opportunity knocks unexpectedly. With an IUD, get it and forget it. And when you\u2019re ready to get pregnant, take it out.\n\nSee Kliff\u2019s post for the few cons. All the approved birth control methods (and their risks) are compared and contrasted in the FDA chart here.\n\nAlthough the IUD is cheaper than, say, the pill in the long run, a big barrier to IUD use has been the upfront cost. For one thing, inserting an IUD requires training, skill, and professional credentials.\n\nAt Salon, Valerie Tarico describes how her daughters paid $1200 each for hormonal IUDs, the reasons why this method has been so costly, and plans for making a new IUD, the Liletta, available more cheaply to low-income women. Find more details on the Liletta from Martha Kempner at RH Reality Check. The FDA approved it in March.\n\nIUD adoption is growing, along with use of the other long-acting reversible contraceptive, the birth control implant, according to Madeleine Schwartz at Fivethirtyeight. Making them available free through the ACA is going to increase their popularity. Especially as word gets out about the statistics on effectiveness Schwartz quotes: \u201cThe IUD has a failure rate of less than 1 percent and is considered to be 45 times more effective than the pill and 90 times more effective than male condoms based on typical use.\u201d\n\nDIY abortion\n\nAndrea Grimes is a Texas writer who recently reported at RH Reality Check on a wine-and-cheese gathering she threw for a few friends. It was not just a social occasion. The women were there to learn the World Health Organization\u2019s protocols for safe self-induced abortion with the drug misoprostol.\n\nIt was something of a brave move. In Texas, Grimes explains, assisting someone to obtain an illegal abortion is a felony (although, she says, \u201cthe law prevents pregnant people themselves from being prosecuted for attempting to induce an abortion on their own.\u201d)\n\nSo Grimes proceeds carefully. \u201cI let people know that the WHO information exists and that it is a medically sound, evidence-based protocol. I am always careful not to advise people directly to use miso; I don\u2019t want to break the law, and neither do others who share the WHO protocols.\u201d\n\nMisoprostol is the second half of the conventional drug-based procedure known as medically induced abortion, commonly used for early abortion. Medication abortion is a standard medical procedure. It is not at all the same thing as emergency contraception, like Plan B, which is used to prevent fertilization shortly after unprotected sex.\n\nThe first half of conventional medically induced abortion employs mifepristone, RU-486, which is taken at a clinic or doctor\u2019s office. Misoprostol is taken later, usually at home. Find a friendly description of standard medically induced abortion, including potential risks and side effects, at the Our Bodies, Ourselves site. Or see the more straight description at WebMD.\n\nBut as the latest edition (2012) of WHO\u2019s \u201cSafe Abortion\u201d explains, the two-pill process is only one approach to abortion. The second pill, misoprostol, can induce abortion by itself. (See, for example, the Executive Summary, p. 4. The \u201cSafe Abortion\u201d PDF can be had free directly from WHO here, and also for free from the US National Library of Medicine here.)\n\nMisoprostol is widely available because it has other medical uses. Some have nothing to do with reproduction\u2013for example, preventing ulcers in people taking NSAIDS. It\u2019s used in veterinary medicine too. In the US, misoprostol requires a prescription. But it is available over the counter in many other countries.\n\nWomen on Waves cites studies showing that misoprostol-only abortions are successful 90% of the time and work best and most safely before 12 weeks of pregnancy. The site also has photos of what misoprostol tablets look like in several parts of the world.\n\nThere\u2019s also news about the 2-drug form of medically supervised abortion. A study published in April in the journal Contraception described new evidence-based protocols, conducted over 5 years with 13,000 women at Los Angeles-area Planned Parenthood clinics. The researchers found that the protocols were more than 95 percent effective up to 63 days of pregnancy, according to Emily Crockett at RH RealityCheck.\n\nThe 63-day limit matters because the FDA has approved the two-drug medical abortion regimen only up to 49 days of pregnancy. The new protocols also used lower drug doses. At Medscape, doc Peter Kovacs found this pretty convincing, concluding \u201cSeveral studies suggest that new protocols could be developed to extend the availability of medical termination services beyond 49 days\u2019 gestation.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Birth control: science's most important achievement Effective birth control is, arguably, the most important human invention since language.
