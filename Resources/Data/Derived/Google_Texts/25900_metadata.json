Kenny Holston, CC BY-ND 2.0\n\nBlood type is one of the body\u2019s more mysterious taxonomies. There are four bins our blood can fall into \u2014 A, B, AB, and O \u2014 and together they represent the four groups of antigens found on the surfaces of red blood cells. But they don\u2019 t just signal who we can donate to and receive from; our blood types can reveal complex patterns of personal health. Here are six to consider:\n\n1. Memory Problems\n\nAt-risk: AB\n\nYour brain and vascular system have more in common than you may think. A recent study found people with type AB blood were 82 percent more likely to experience difficulties with memory recall, language, and attention than people with other types. One reason, researchers suspect, is due to the key clotting protein, known as coagulation factor VIII, which may actually reduce the quality of blood flow to the brain, rather than sealing up injury sites.\n\n\u201cSince factor VIII levels are closely linked to blood type, this may be one causal connection between blood type and cognitive impairment,\u201d said Mary Cushman, author of the recent study, to Yahoo Health.\n\n2. Pancreatic Cancer\n\nAt-risk: Non-O\n\nIt may be more accurate to say people with type O blood are at a lower risk for pancreatic cancer, given the work researchers from Yale University are doing on bacterial infection. In a study conducted last July, scientists from the University\u2019s Cancer Center looked at cases of a common species of bacteria called Helicobacter pylori, or H. pylori, that lives in people\u2019s gut.\n\nThey found people with H. pylori were significantly more likely to develop pancreatic cancer, due to the way A and B antigens help the bacteria thrive. People with type O blood carry no antigens on the surface of their red blood cells. This is what allows them to donate to anyone.\n\n3. Heart Disease\n\nAt-risk: AB\n\nA 2012 study from Harvard University found people with non-O blood also happen to have an increased risk for cardiovascular disease. But those with type AB blood were the most at-risk overall, demonstrating a 23 percent greater chance of suffering from heart disease than type O subjects.\n\nStudy author Dr. Lu Qi, an assistant professor in the Department of Nutrition, said the particular makeup of people\u2019s antigens should be given the same weight we already assign to cholesterol and blood pressure. \"While people cannot change their blood type, our findings may help physicians better understand who is at risk for developing heart disease,\u201d Qi said in a statement.\n\n4. Stress\n\nAt-risk: A\n\nBecause certain blood types are more likely to co-occur with varying levels of hormones in the body, physicians commonly tailor their exercise recommendations to the patient\u2019s type. People with type A blood, for example, are more likely to have higher levels of cortisol, the stress hormone, in their body. So, stress-reducing exercises, like Tai Chi and yoga, may be more beneficial at cutting that tension than running or weightlifting alone.\n\nWhen the adrenal gland dumps more and more cortisol into the blood, people\u2019s stress response grows more acute. People with type A blood may find themselves getting anxious more quickly and having a harder time letting troubles roll off their back.\n\n5. Exercise Demands\n\nMore generally, the makeup of a person\u2019s antigens on his or her red blood cells can determine how much of a certain hormone gets released. People with type A and B blood respond better to calming, low-intensity exercise like yoga, especially if depression runs in the family. Likewise, people with AB blood benefit from well-rounded workouts that keep their immune systems in check. Type O people, however, are a different story.\n\n\u201cType O\u2019s are more prone to problems that arise from an inability to clear stress hormones from their system quickly,\u201d Dr. Ginger Nash, a naturopathic physician, told Personalized Living. \u201cIt takes more to get a Type O stressed but it takes more to de-stress them as well.\u201d\n\n6. Gut Bacteria\n\nIn addition to living on your red blood cells, antigens are often found in the lining of your digestive tract \u2014 about 80 percent of people fall into this category. Much of the bacteria living in people\u2019s gut uses these antigens as food, which largely determines which bacteria flourish and which disappear. Prior research has estimated, for instance, that people with type B blood contain up to 50,000 times the number of strains of friendly bacteria than people with either type A or O blood.\n\n\u201cIncreasingly, studies are showing that changes in the microflora content of the digestive tract can be linked to metabolic illnesses, including type II (adult onset) diabetes and obesity,\u201d wrote Dr. Peter D\u2019Adamo, physician and author of Eat Right 4 Your Type, in a blog post. \u201cBlood group and secretor status play an important role in conditioning the overall characteristics of the digestive tract.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "6, ways, blood, type, can, influence, personal, health, mild, stress, cancer", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The antigens living on the surface of your red blood cells can determine a lot more than just who you can donate to.", "title": "6 Things Your Blood Type Can Say About Your Health", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/6-ways-blood-type-can-influence-personal-health-mild-stress-cancer-304518", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/23/blood.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The antigens living on the surface of your red blood cells can determine a lot more than just who you can donate to.", "title": "6 Things Your Blood Type Can Say About Your Health", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/6-ways-blood-type-can-influence-personal-health-mild-stress-cancer-304518", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/23/blood.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/23/blood.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-09-24T08:00:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-13T09:00:50-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The antigens living on the surface of your red blood cells can determine a lot more than just who you can donate to."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9abf\"", "article_summary": "\u201cSince factor VIII levels are closely linked to blood type, this may be one causal connection between blood type and cognitive impairment,\u201d said Mary Cushman, author of the recent study, to Yahoo Health.\nPeople with type O blood carry no antigens on the surface of their red blood cells.\nThe antigens living on the surface of your red blood cells can determine a lot more than just who you can donate to.\nWhen the adrenal gland dumps more and more cortisol into the blood, people\u2019s stress response grows more acute.\n\"While people cannot change their blood type, our findings may help physicians better understand who is at risk for developing heart disease,\u201d Qi said in a statement."}
