REUTERS/Larry Downing\n\n4460562\n\nFamed Democrat strategist Pat Caddell is one of the most unvarnished, independent critics of Washington elites. Living in Charleston, S.C., he commutes to New York for his Fox News show, \u201cPolitical Insiders,\u201d following successful careers in Washington and Hollywood.\n\nThis surprising, far-ranging video interview details his personal path defending ordinary citizens, while sounding more pro-American than most in his political party. Entertaining and riveting, Caddell is an equal opportunity critic of both parties. He explains the evolution of the Democratic Party, his growing fear of President Obama\u2019s governance and the corruption of the media.\n\nImportantly, last December he issued a stunning three-part poll of Republican voters found here, here and here. It revealed what he calls a \u201clarge Grand Canyon chasm\u201d between Republican voters and their leaders in Congress. Stunningly, \u201c60% wanted someone new to lead them.\u201d\n\nAmnesty and repeal of Obamacare were pivotal issues for these voters, as well as their hostility to the budget negotiations on the CRomnibus following a wave election for Republicans. Undoubtedly, most Democrats relish the disunity and mistakes being made by Republican leaders who seem to cater more to the left-wing media elite than their own base.\n\nRank and file members of Congress find their constituents and supporters back home growing anxious and frustrated, while Republican leaders dismiss these citizens as mindless \u201cgroups trying to raise money off of Boehner\u201d and McConnell. Caddell\u2019s poll demonstrates that citizens want a more effective opposition to Obama\u2019s policies.\n\nOne of the two Republican leaders confidently told a dinner companion last year that he can ignore the tea party agenda, as it is \u201conly 8% of his base.\u201d Caddell has news for the mistaken leader and others showing ignorance of those who put them in office. Caddell confirms, \u201cIt ain\u2019t 8%. It\u2019s about 40% of his voters.\u201d He is stunned at the disconnect that seems to be growing in the Republican Party. He even relayed a warning that \u201c1/4 to 1/3 of Republicans appear ready to bolt their party.\u201d\n\nCaddell discusses a \u201cdonor, lobbyist, establishment class\u201d of Republicans who \u201chave lost election after election\u201d while lining their own pockets, abusing donors and destroying candidates. \u201cThey have no message,\u201d he declares. \u201cThe problem with Republicans is that as long as they can keep their hands on their goodies in this town, a lot of these lawyers, lobbyists and others, they don\u2019t care whether the Republican Party wins or what happens to the country.\u201d\n\nHe says Republicans hire consultants who \u201chave the morality of storm-troopers\u201d to suppress the grassroots and intimidate anyone who dissents from strategies designed by leadership.\n\nAs for his assessment of Republicans stopping Obama\u2019s transformation of the country, Caddell says unequivocally, \u201cBasically, Republicans are wusses,\u201d and describes opportunities to leverage \u201cthe power of the purse\u201d provided by the Constitution to the legislative branch.\n\nClearly, Caddell thinks more effective oversight should be a staple of Republican tactics. The failure of the Republicans to go after the IRS with full-throated intensity for targeting Obama\u2019s political opponents is especially galling to this man, who still bristles at being the youngest person on President Nixon\u2019s enemies list. He even chastises Hillary Clinton, who previously worked to bring Nixon down for such abuse of power, while seemingly supporting such things now.\n\nCaddell surveys the political landscape and says Washington \u201creminds him of Vienna in 1914 on the cusp of World War I,\u201d where inside the perimeter all seemed well, while war was about to break out only a few miles away.\n\nHe says the country is at a tipping point, \u201ca pre-revolutionary moment,\u201d where citizen power is eroding while Washington is absorbed with keeping its own power. To him, the country is in decline, politicians are self-absorbed and President Obama is in a dangerous \u201ctwilight zone\u201d without media scrutiny.\n\nThe Benghazi deaths that revealed Obama\u2019s failed foreign policy still make his blood boil. He wonders if the famed investigative journalist Bob Woodward is really a \u201cclone from the Invasion of the Body Snatchers,\u201d since he shows no interest in uncovering the greatest cover-up in American history. Mitt Romney is also a target of Caddell\u2019s wrath for deserting his country in the third presidential debate when he failed to pursue the Benghazi matter simply because he thought he was going to win.\n\nThe strategist recalls \u201cwhen the Democrat Party was the voice of the common man, not the dictator to the common man.\u201d Today, Democrats \u201chave become a tool totally controlled by special interests. The left doesn\u2019t care about ordinary people.\u201d He says big environmental funders like \u201cTom Steyer basically control the White House and other people.\u201d He detests hypocrites who \u201cfly around in private planes but think the rest of us have to have bicycles.\u201d\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s State of the Union address was \u201cterrifying\u201d to Caddell, as he saw a president who looked like he \u201clives in his own bubble in a universe far, far from where we live\u201d with \u201ca team of sycophants.\u201d He continued, \u201cWe can survive bad domestic policy. With foreign policy, he can threaten security and destroy the world.\u201d Caddell mentions how this \u201cship of fools\u201d running foreign policy shockingly promoted the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt. They can\u2019t even call the Islamic State \u201cIslamic terrorism.\u201d\n\nHe thinks America is at a \u201ctipping point\u201d and puts the blame mostly on Democrats, harkening back to how it was Republicans who finally clamored for Nixon to resign. Cadell asks, \u201cWho will go tell this president what time of day it is,\u201d breaking through the bubble he\u2019s living in?\n\nMrs. Thomas does not necessarily support or endorse the products, services or positions promoted in any advertisement contained herein, and does not have control over or receive compensation from any advertiser.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Ginni Thomas", "description": "Democrat Strategist UNLOADS: My Party Is The 'Dictator To The Common Man'", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Famed Democrat strategist Pat Caddell is one of the most unvarnished, independent critics of Washington elites.
