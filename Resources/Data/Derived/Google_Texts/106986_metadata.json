But, for a number of reasons, enrollment numbers are considerably short of goals.\n\nWith less than two weeks remaining for people to buy health coverage for 2015, it\u2019s going to be a scramble for the state insurance exchange to hit its goals.\n\nThe good news is that since the Affordable Care Act kicked in, hundreds of thousands of formerly uninsured people have coverage in Washington through the expansion of Medicaid and sale of individual health-insurance plans.\n\nThe trouble for the Washington Health Benefit Exchange, which runs the state insurance marketplace, is that too few people are buying their coverage through the Washington Healthplanfinder website, which needs to reach the enrollment targets to help pay for its operating costs.\n\nExchange enrollment Insurance enrollment data are from Jan. 25. New Medicaid enrollees are from September 2013 to January 2015. New exchange insurance enrollees: 40,000 Goal of new enrollees: 83,000 Percentage of goal: 48 percent Exchange insurance renewals: 87,000 Enrollees in first year: 139,700 Percentage who renewed: 62 percent New Medicaid enrollees: 485,000 Total Medicaid: 1.7 million Source: Washington Health Benefit Exchange and Washington Health Care Authority.\n\nBy Jan. 25, the state was only 60 percent of the way toward its goal of selling 213,000 insurance plans in the current enrollment period, which began in November. The window for this second round of enrollments closes Feb. 15.\n\nThere are numerous reasons for the underwhelming sales. Some officials think the nationally set enrollment window was badly timed, spanning Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays, when distractions abound and pocketbooks are strained. Then there\u2019s the challenge of enrollment closing before most people fill out their tax returns, which means many uninsured people will realize too late how much they\u2019re being penalized for going without coverage.\n\nIn addition, enrollment projections in Washington underestimated how many residents would be eligible for Medicaid, pulling them out of the pool of potential exchange customers. In the past 16 months, the number of Medicaid enrollees has grown by nearly half a million, to 1.7 million.\n\nFinally, many exchange customers from the first enrollment received confusing or insufficient notices about what they needed to do to renew their plans, sometimes leaving them uninsured when they meant for their coverage to continue.\n\nThat\u2019s what happened to James Bach, of Orcas Island. Bach and his wife, Lenore, bought insurance through the exchange last year and planned to keep it. A flier from their insurance company, Group Health, assured them they would be renewed automatically. Buried in a second notice was a sentence advising that they might need to take action to renew, but it wasn\u2019t explicit.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until Bach tried to use his insurance in January that he learned it had been canceled at the end of 2014.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like turning someone\u2019s power off,\u201d Bach said, noting that if a company is going to shut off your power, water or cable, you get repeated notices with big red letters warning you there\u2019s a problem. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t they do it with health insurance?\u201d\n\nBach, who runs a software-testing business, should have received a notice from the exchange telling him to renew, but he said he never got one.\n\nMelinda Hews, executive director of health-insurance exchanges at Group Health, said her organization was told a batch of 20,000 reminders mistakenly was not sent by the exchange before the end of the year.\n\nIf you need to renew For exchange customers still needing to renew their coverage: \u2022 Log in to your online account at wahealthplanfinder.org. \u2022 Under Quick Links, click on \u201cUpdate my Applications and Renew my Coverage.\u201d \u2022 Update the online application as needed (it should already have your information from last year). \u2022 Once you receive an eligibility result, you can renew your 2014 plan, which will be highlighted at the top of the shopping screen, or choose a new plan. \u2022 Select a plan and submit your payment to start coverage. \u2022 Customers who had difficulty enrolling by the Dec. 23 deadline for Jan. 1 coverage may request retroactive coverage at petition.wahealthplanfinder.org.\n\nExchange officials say they are certain everyone was provided renewal information.\n\n\u201cThere has been many fingers pointing in all directions,\u201d Hews said. \u201cWe\u2019re sorry for the confusion that this new process caused people.\u201d\n\nEveryone with exchange insurance needs to go back to his or her Healthplanfinder account and give permission to pay for the coverage, said Michael Marchand, spokesman for the exchange. It\u2019s like a magazine subscription, he said: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t automatically renew unless you give the system the OK to bill their card.\u201d\n\nIf exchange customers find that their coverage was inadvertently canceled or if they had technical problems causing them to miss an enrollment deadline, they can fill out a petition to request that their plan be made retroactive to prevent any gaps in coverage.\n\nBach opted to take his business elsewhere.\n\n\u201cWe decided to abandon the exchange because of this crazy thing,\u201d he said. He also changed insurers.\n\n\u201cSomeone\u2019s life could actually be at stake, and people are trying to cover their butt,\u201d Bach said.\n\nWorking with a broker in Friday Harbor, the couple found a new plan that started Feb. 1 and say they\u2019ve have had a positive experience overall.\n\nNationwide, exchange enrollments seem to be going better than in Washington.\n\nBy the end of January, 9.5 million people signed up for insurance or were automatically re-enrolled in plans sold through the federally run exchange or from one of the 13 states with their own exchange site.\n\nWhile the number includes people who haven\u2019t yet paid for their coverage, it seems likely the Obama administration will meet this year\u2019s enrollment goal of 9.1 million customers.\n\nThe Washington exchange and its partner organizations are hustling to promote coverage, and they\u2019re shifting tactics to include messages highlighting the penalties faced by those who remain uninsured.\n\nMost Americans must have 2015 coverage or face a penalty of $325 per adult or 2 percent of their adjusted income \u2014 whichever is higher.\n\nThe campaign is particularly targeting younger residents, who often need more convincing of the benefits of health insurance. Tuesday night, the exchange sponsored the launch party for the Sasquatch! Music Festival, a popular concert at the Columbia Gorge over Memorial Day weekend. The exchange is running ads on music websites, social media channels and by radio DJs. Public Health \u2014 Seattle & King County is doing outreach events at community colleges.\n\nAnd a pro-insurance public-service announcement starring Seahawks Russell Wilson and Richard Sherman has racked up 1.8 million views since it was released in early January.\n\nMarchand said enrollments look like they\u2019re ticking up this first week of February \u2014 and he hopes the trend continues.\n\nThat\u2019s because funding for Healthplanfinder comes from three sources: the exchange\u2019s share of a 2 percent tax on all insurance premiums, a fee charged on insurance companies selling through the exchange, and from cost sharing with the state agency that manages Medicaid.\n\nPeople eligible for Medicaid, which is locally called Apple Health, sign up for the program through the Healthplanfinder website.\n\nThe board overseeing the exchange is asking state lawmakers to approve a budget request of $147 million over two years, which is already higher than what the Legislature initially allocated.\n\nThrough new sales or renewals, the exchange needs to sell 86,000 plans in the last three weeks of open enrollment to reach its target and provide funding to operate within that request.\n\nMarchand said the exchange knows lawmakers will be looking everywhere to make cuts, not grow budgets.\n\nThat could mean paring back services, he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to figure out how to live within our means.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Feb. 15 deadline is looming for people to sign up for individual insurance plans sold through Washington Healthplanfinder.
