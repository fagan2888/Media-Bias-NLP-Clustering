About his candidacy: Chafee\u2019s also a former U.S. Senator and a former Republican. The niche he hopes to occupy: voting against Iraqi war authorization back in his days in Washington (at the time, the only Republican to do so) \u2014 which Hillary Clinton obviously did not.\n\nMany of Chafee\u2019s positions are boiler-plate Democratic: he\u2019s pro-choice, signed bills legalizing same-sex marriage and addressing climate change while he was the Ocean State\u2019s governor, and he\u2019s in favor of a higher minimum wage and minimal tinkering with Obamacare. But there is one position where Chafee breaks with political orthodoxy: he wants to convert America to the metric system. In 1975, the federal government adopted metric as the nation\u2019s \u201cpreferred measurement system\u201d \u2013 at the time, establishing the United States Metric Board to manage the transition.\n\nHowever, the movement metered, er, petered out not long afterwards. To quote the fictional Dr. Sheldon Cooper: \u201cBlame President James \u201cJimmy\u201d Carter. He started America on a path to the metric system but then just gave up. He wonders why he was a one-term president.\u201d\n\nToday, the U.S., Liberia, and Myanmar are the lone holdouts against the metric system. But not so if Chafee shocks the world by winning the Democratic nomination and the presidency \u2014 and then puzzles football fans everywhere with what to call \u201cfirst and 10\u2033 or \u201cfastest time in the 40.\u2033\n\nSpeaking of football, there\u2019s other casualty brewing should Chafee be given the chance to take new measure of the nation. And that would be the \u201cinch by inch\u201d pre-game speech [some non-CoC language] from 1999\u2019s Any Given Sunday:\n\nAll of which suggests the possibility of a new third rail of presidential politics (let\u2019s call it a Godfather/Dog Day Afternoon/Scent of a Woman crossover demographic): scenery-chewing Al Pacino soliloquies.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/wp-content/uploads/fbrfg/browserconfig.xml", "og": {"site_name": "Ricochet", "description": "Former Rhode Island Governor Lincoln Chafee entered the Democratic side of the presidential sweepstakes yesterday.\u00a0About his candidacy:\u00a0Chafee\u2019s also a former U.S. Senator and a former Republican.
