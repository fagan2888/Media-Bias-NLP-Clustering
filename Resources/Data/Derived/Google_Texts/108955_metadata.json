Organizers handed out shiny pink bead necklaces in a cheeky twist on the infamous Mardi Gras tradition meant to encourage attendees to get a mammogram.\n\nThe event, which kicked off with a parade, aimed to bring together resources available for preventing breast cancer and organizations that provide financial help to those who need them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not enough for us to get the word out about mammograms if we don\u2019t have a way for people to pay for it,\u201d said Catherine Gaines, a certified physician assistant and lead patient navigator for Southeastern Health.\n\nRobeson Health Care Corporation introduced people to its Breast and Cervical Cancer Control Program, which helps the uninsured get mammograms. Gibson Cancer Center staff took down women\u2019s names to schedule them for the screenings and handed out pamphlets on how to conduct a breast exam. Legal Aid and Enroll America guided attendees through the Affordable Care Act.\n\nGaines said it is particularly important to inform black women in Robeson County about the importance of early detection. Although white women have the highest breast cancer incidence rate, black women are twice as likely to die from the disease.\n\nGaines has been delivering that startling statistic at churches countywide, telling women \u201cif you find something, get it checked right away.\u201d\n\nOne in eight women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime, according to the American Cancer Society, and the disease is the second leading cause of death in women. Family history doesn\u2019t play much of a role, as 85 percent of women with breast cancer do not have it in their family.\n\nThe American Cancer Society recommends that women start getting annual mammograms at age 40. Women should conduct self exams monthly.\n\nRegular doctor visits were critical for Sykes, who said she did not feel a lump in her breast before being diagnosed on her 63rd birthday.\n\n\u201cTwenty-five years ago, it was a death sentence,\u201d she said. \u201cBut now, we have so many survivors. If you go and get your mammogram and catch it early, you can survive.\u201d\n\nKimberly Worley, who was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2011 at age 39, said events like Friday\u2019s health fair aren\u2019t just informational, they\u2019re also good for the soul.\n\n\u201cWe want them to leave educated. But it also helps with your attitude. It makes you feel better about yourself knowing you\u2019re not alone,\u201d said Worley, who was decked out in pink ribbon jewelry.\n\n\u201cWe know their feelings, we know what they\u2019ve been through,\u201d said Linda B. Rice, who was diagnosed with colon cancer in 2009.\n\nAngelicia Hicks is putting her experience with cancer on the stage. Hicks, the owner of Angelyric Productions, had a booth at Friday\u2019s fair introducing attendees to the play she wrote, produced and directed, \u201cI Too Survived.\u201d Hicks, whose aunt had breast cancer, said the play shows a woman\u2019s cancer diagnosis and its effect on her family through her husband\u2019s perspective.\n\nLike Friday\u2019s fair, the play incorporates some fun and humor.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want the show to necessarily be sad. Whenever you hear about cancer, you hear about the negatives things \u2026 you can also be uplifted,\u201d she said. Hicks\u2019 play hits the stage Oct. 24.

And, most importantly, by getting a mammogram.\n\n\u201cThat little bit of discomfort is worth it to find out,\u201d Worley said. \u201d \u2026 Don\u2019t let fear keep you from doing what you need to do for yourself.\u201d\n\nSarah Willets | The Robesonian Attendees at a Mardi Gras Mammogram Madness event put on by Southeastern Health on Friday learned about breast cancer prevention and financial aid.
