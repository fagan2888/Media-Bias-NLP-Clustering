No, not the elections. Let\u2019s take a break from that for a moment. This is about open enrollment, that annual period when the masses of wage slaves enroll or re-enroll for health insurance, weighing plans and options, considering costs and other factors \u2014 and not really understanding much of any of it before signing up for one more year.\n\nThe tens of thousands of Minnesotans who get their insurance not through an employer but through MNsure, our public exchange under the federal Affordable Care Act, may be feeling especially stressed this fall. Rates are rising. There\u2019s the pressure to make a good decision. And the woes of MNsure, going into just its third year, remain fresh: the computer crashes, the long waits on hold for help, the leadership lapses and more.\n\n\u201cWe have not had a perfect past. That has been widely reported, and we face that every time I have a conversation,\u201d MNsure Interim CEO Allison O\u2019Toole said in an interview this month with members of the News Tribune editorial board. \u201cYou can\u2019t run from your history. It is what it is.\u201d\n\nBut you can learn from past mistakes to make the future better. And that\u2019s just what MNsure has done, O\u2019Toole promised on the eve of open enrollment, which starts Nov. 1 and runs through the end of January. She can be held to it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s night and day,\u201d O\u2019Toole said. There are no longer computer system stability issues. Hourlong waits on hold when calling in for help are now under two minutes. And more Minnesotans than ever are getting covered.\n\n\u201cWe are really working night and day to make sure consumers get the help they need,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re really a consumer-protection organization. \u2026 Our mission is to provide market transparency. We\u2019re one of the only places where you can do apples-to-apples comparisons of the hundred plans that are available.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s especially critical this year with rates on the rise and anecdotal evidence of more employers, especially smaller employers, dropping health insurance and leaving their workers to fend for themselves on the public exchange.\n\nWith tax credits, discounts and other savings available, going to mnsure.org doesn\u2019t have to be intimidating, O\u2019Toole said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re the only place where consumers can get the tax credits. We\u2019re the only place where people can save money, and it\u2019s like an instant discount right off your premium every month,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just really trying to get the word out to help consumers save money: It literally pays to shop,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s worth it for people to take 20 or 30 minutes to see what they qualify for before they make a decision. We don\u2019t want them to leave money on the table.\u201d\n\nLast year, health care consumers in Minnesota saved $31 million via tax credits. Free help is available again this year via \u201cnavigators\u201d to point consumers toward savings and through the sign-up or re-enrollment processes. Duluth has 15 navigators at seven sites under the umbrella of the Insure Duluth Coalition, a collaborative of 16 organizations. The navigators are at the Lake Superior Community Health Center, Community Action Duluth, CHUM, Salvation Army, Duluth Public Library, Women\u2019s Health Center and Generations Health Care Initiatives. Or call the United Way\u2019s 211 hotline.\n\n\u201cWe really encourage people to use the navigators,\u201d Jenny Peterson of the Insure Duluth Coalition told editorial board members. \u201cI think we all know MNsure had a rocky start and some people aren\u2019t comfortable with the process. Some people aren\u2019t comfortable with the terminology. \u2026 Navigators can really help.\u201d\n\nDespite all of MNsure\u2019s woes, Minnesota is doing better than most states in making sure its residents have coverage, one of the main goals of President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act. Minnesota is one of only five states with 95 percent or more of residents covered.\n\nOf course, that means about 275,000 Minnesotans still are without coverage. So more effort clearly can be made.\n\n\u201cOur goal is always to get to perfection, but you know that is not totally realistic,\u201d O\u2019Toole said. \u201cI think the lowest rate of uninsurance is about 3 percent in Massachusetts. They\u2019ve been at this for about a decade longer than we have. But I still sure would like to drive our number closer to 3.\u201d\n\nReaching a goal like that can\u2019t be promised. Not yet. But other promises \u2014 especially free sign-up help and a smoother, hassle-free enrollment period this year as compared to the past two years \u2014 O\u2019Toole and MNsure can be held to. It\u2019s stressful enough this time of year as it is.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "opinion,our view,Health,Money,Business,Minnesota", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"url": "http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/opinion/our-view/3871027-our-view-open-enrollment-getting-less-scary", "site_name": "Duluth News Tribune", "image": {"width": 300, "identifier": "http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/sites/default/files/styles/square_300/public/field/image/editpg1029.jpg?itok=h4KguSTQ", "height": 300}, "type": "article", "title": "Our view: Is open enrollment getting less scary?"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/opinion/our-view/3871027-our-view-open-enrollment-getting-less-scary", "image": "http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/sites/default/files/styles/16x9_430/public/field/image/editpg1029.jpg?itok=YgDqGaQX", "site": "duluthnews", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Our view: Is open enrollment getting less scary?"}, "fb": {"app_id": 264600393705982}, "keywords": "opinion,our view,Health,Money,Business,Minnesota", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/duluthnews", "tag": "opinion,our view,Health,Money,Business,Minnesota", "modified_time": "2015-10-28T22:30:52-05:00"}, "image": {"alt": "(John Cole / Cagle Cartoons)", "title": "Cartoonist's view"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "That stressful time of year is here again.
