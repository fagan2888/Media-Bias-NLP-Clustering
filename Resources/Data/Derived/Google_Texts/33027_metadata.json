Following the path of several Republican governors, he issued a do-nothing executive order instead that will create a commission tasked with reviewing the Common Core State Standards.\n\nThe commission which will be created as a result of this executive order will have to report its initial findings to Christie by December 31, 2015. The final report will be issued by July 31, 2015.\n\nThere is no action plan after that. The order doesn\u2019t specify what type of people who will serve other than it will be \u201ccomprised of 9 appointees who have practical experience, knowledge, or expertise in the areas of education policy or administration and will serve without compensation. \u201c Also the commission the executive order states may (not shall) \u201cconsult with education stakeholders, practitioners, experts or other knowledgeable individuals in the public or private sector on any aspect of its mission.\u201d No public hearings\u2026 no ability for parents to weigh in that I can see.\n\nThe bill before the New Jersey Senate that was delayed for this garbage executive order would have established a task force under the control of the legislature, and it would have delayed the PARCC assessment by two years. This does nothing of the sort.\n\nIn fact the point of the Commission, according to the Christie administration, is to ensure an effective implementation of the Common Core and PARCC. They state in a press release sent out yesterday, \u201cThe creation of this Commission will also help ensure the effectiveness of the Core Curriculum Content Standards, including the Common Core State Standards, and the Partnership for Assessment of Readiness of College and Careers (PARCC) assessments.\u201d\n\nThere is absolutely no plan on replacing the Common Core whatsoever.\n\nJan Lenox of Concerned Citizens of Southern New Jersey told Caffeinated Thoughts, \u201cAfter sitting in the Senate Chamber last Thursday for almost three hours waiting for our bill to be put for a vote for the third time; the result is what took place yesterday. The Governor in a three-way, let\u2019s cut a deal, with the senate president and the NJEA, completely dissed New Jersey\u2019s children and their parents from a fair way to resolve the issue of Common Core. This is a complete travesty.\u201d\n\nHere is the text of his Common Core executive order:\n\nTop that off he\u2019s bad on judges. The Judicial Crisis Network has put an ad out in Iowa blasting Christie on a deal he made with New Jersey Senate President Steven Sweeney, a Democrat, to renominate Stuart Rabner \u2013 a very liberal activist judge to be the chief justice of a liberal activist New Jersey Supreme Court.\n\nHere is the text of the 90 second ad is accompanied by a website \u2013 www.christiebadonjudges.com and the group is spending $75,000 on the three day ad campaign leading up to fundraiser he is doing for Iowa Governor Terry Branstad in Marion, IA on Thursday.\n\nHere is the text of the ad:\n\nNew Jersey\u2019s Supreme Court has been one of the most activist courts in the nation. And the people of New Jersey have paid a heavy price. The court\u2019s liberal rulings have wreaked havoc on state finances, driven away business and jeopardized jobs. Because of their lawless rulings New Jersey\u2019s property taxes are the highest in the country. One scholar called it the court that broke New Jersey. Over and over, Gov. Christie promised he would fix it\u2026 remake the court with judges who respect the rule of law. Over and over, he broke his promise.\u201d Christie has had five openings on the New Jersey Supreme Court to build a new majority, but the court remains liberal. One Christie appointee, the Chief Justice, is a Democrat. So liberal that he was mentioned as a Barack Obama nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court. Christie even endorsed Obama\u2019 liberal Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor. Important issues like Obamacare are at stake in our courts. the next President of the United States may get to appoint as many as three U.S. Supreme Court nominees \u2013 a new majority. Call Chris Christie \u2013 tell him to fight for judges who respect the rule of law.\n\nYou can watch the ad:\n\nSome Republicans seem to have forgotten the whole George Washington Bridge scandal, as well as, a federal investigation into how Christie used Hurricane Sandy relief funds. Some say that it pales in light of what President Obama has done, it doesn\u2019t matter. It is still a scandal. It shows an abuse of power that Republicans wouldn\u2019t tolerate in a Democrat, but we\u2019re going to let it slide with Christie?\n\nIf I were Branstad I wouldn\u2019t want to be seen in the same room with the man, and the fact he still chairs the Republican Governors Association (which has also poured a ton of money into the Iowa Governor\u2019s race in the form of ads) shows me that organization has some major dysfunction.\n\nThe fact that some establishment Republicans still view this guy as a contender makes me think they\u2019ve been making a lot of trips out to Colorado. He\u2019s DOA he comes calling for the Iowa Caucus. After all this his Obama bear hug is the least of his problems in 2016.", "article_metadata": {"shareaholic": {"site_name": "Caffeinated Thoughts", "language": "en-US", "url": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/2014/07/chris-christie-bad-common-core-judges-bridges/", "article_author_name": "Shane Vander Hart", "image": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/obama-christie.jpg", "site_id": "965f58835b5900850067f65116487024", "article_published_time": "2014-07-15T21:03:53+00:00", "shareable_page": "true", "article_modified_time": "2016-05-25T11:32:47+00:00", "keywords": "barack obama, chris christie, common core state standards, george washington bridge scandal, hurricane sandy, iowa caucus, judicial crisis network, new jersey supreme court, terry branstad, education, election central", "wp_version": "7.7.1.0"}, "description": "Chris Christie is bad on the Common Core, judges and is embroiled in two different scandals, so his Obama bear hug is the least of his problems in 2016.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Caffeinated Thoughts", "description": "Chris Christie is bad on the Common Core, judges and is embroiled in two different scandals, so his Obama bear hug is the least of his problems in 2016.", "title": "Chris Christie is Bad on Common Core, Judges and Bridges | Caffeinated Thoughts", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/obama-christie.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-07-15T16:25:02-05:00", "url": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/2014/07/chris-christie-bad-common-core-judges-bridges/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Chris Christie is bad on the Common Core, judges and is embroiled in two different scandals, so his Obama bear hug is the least of his problems in 2016.", "title": "Chris Christie is Bad on Common Core, Judges and Bridges | Caffeinated Thoughts", "image": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/obama-christie.jpg", "creator": "@shanevanderhart", "site": "@CaffThoughts", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 259594777484510}, "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/CaffThoughts", "published_time": "2014-07-15T16:03:53-05:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/shanevanderhart", "section": "Education", "modified_time": "2014-07-15T16:25:02-05:00", "tag": "Terry Branstad"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbc6c\"", "article_summary": "This is a complete travesty.\u201dHere is the text of his Common Core executive order:Top that off he\u2019s bad on judges.\nNew Jersey Governor Chris Christie could have done something meaningful to address Common Core, but he didn\u2019t.\nIn fact the point of the Commission, according to the Christie administration, is to ensure an effective implementation of the Common Core and PARCC.\nHere is the text of the ad:New Jersey\u2019s Supreme Court has been one of the most activist courts in the nation.\nFollowing the path of several Republican governors, he issued a do-nothing executive order instead that will create a commission tasked with reviewing the Common Core State Standards."}
