I think our biggest problem is a culture that has rejected Biblical principles of ownership authority and personal responsibility that has led to out of control spending and government overreach. From my perspective, the economy is struggles because of over-regulation and over-taxation. We need personal freedom to live life without an overbearing government. Most everything the government does to try to help ends up hurting the very people it tries to help.\n\nFirst I will oppose all tax increases. Instead of adding new programs and new regulations, I will vote to repeal unnecessary programs and regulations, such as overbearing insurance regulations and forced labor representation. We need to defend Kentuckians against overbearing federal regulations like Obamacare and the anti-coal regulations coming from the EPA. We can do that by refusing to participate in or outright oppose these unconstitutional actions.\n\nThe best way to create jobs is to get government out of the way of job creators. We can do that with lower, simpler taxes across the board. We need to reintroduce freedom into the labor market to encourage job creators to create the best possible jobs for Kentuckians.\n\nMarket forces, not government, set the true minimum wage. If government tries to raise wages artificially, the weakest members of the workforce will be hurt. Those with fewer skills, single mothers, and young people getting their start will face higher hurdles to finding any jobs and higher prices for necessities like food and gasoline.\n\nWe have great teachers that do their best to provide the best education they can. Outsourcing curriculum decisions to an unelected group through Common Core is dangerous. Local communities, especially parents, know what is best for their children and should be allowed any opportunity to seek the best for them. This is best accomplished by local funding and local control.\n\nSince Obamacare was passed, insurance costs have gone up and services provided have gone down. Forcing people to buy products they don\u2019t need has been disastrous. We have a financial healthcare crisis is because we abandoned the free market in healthcare decades ago. No one goes to the doctor and asks, \u201cHow much does this procedure cost?\u201d There is no competition therefore prices skyrocket. Frivolous lawsuits are driving up costs, too. Doctors are now playing defense in their practices rather than treating patients in innovative ways. Some version of tort reform needs to occur to return to a mindset of personal responsibility.\n\nThe 2nd Amendment is very clear: \u201cthe right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.\u201d Law-abiding citizens have the right to carry weapons in defense of themselves and their neighbors. I support Constitutional Carry which allows the 2nd amendment to take the place of a conceal carry permit for law-abiding citizens. A- Rating with the NRA\n\nGun Owners of America endorsed\n\nMany people see casino gambling as a way to raise tax money or to pay off corporate interests with monopoly protections. We cannot gamble our way out of our current financial mess in Frankfort. We have a spending problem, not a revenue problem. I would be in favor of changing the Kentucky Constitution to allow gambling in the state, but I oppose the current proposals for implementing gambling because they choose industry favorites and create new gambling monopolies, which is not a free market solution.", "article_metadata": {"category": "In Their Own Words", "ib-analytics": "data", "item-publish-date": "Wed, 24 Sep 2014 16:05:58 EDT", "generator": "CoreMedia", "og": {"site_name": "WLKY", "description": "Alan Claypool is the Republican running for State Representative in Kentucky District 10.", "title": "In their own words: Alan Claypool", "url": "http://www.wlky.com/politics/in-their-own-words/in-their-own-words-alan-claypool/28223624", "image": "http://www.wlky.com/image/view/-/28224292/highRes/1/-/maxh/630/maxw/1200/-/dgj2kjz/-/-alan-claypool-0000-jpg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.wlky.com/politics/in-their-own-words/in-their-own-words-alan-claypool/28223624", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "wlky://content/article/28223624", "iphone": "wlky://content/article/28223624", "googleplay": "wlky://content/article/28223624"}, "name": {"ipad": "wlky", "iphone": "wlky", "googleplay": "wlky"}, "id": {"ipad": 505982816, "iphone": 505982816, "googleplay": "com.hearst.android.wlky"}}, "site": "@WLKY", "card": "app"}, "al": {"android": {"url": "wlky://content/article/28223624", "app_name": "wlky", "package": "com.hearst.android.wlky"}, "ios": {"url": "wlky://content/article/28223624", "app_store_id": 505982816, "app_name": "wlky"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 167646758083}, "keywords": "louisville politics, louisville political news, kentucky politics, political news kentucky, national political news", "google-site-verification": "PoNDN6cYP4lYVxeeYHY36I2c18DU9CHF0lvth9b5g5c", "news_keywords": "louisville politics, louisville political news, kentucky politics, political news kentucky, national political news", "description": "Alan Claypool is the Republican running for State Representative in Kentucky District 10."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccd7f\"", "article_summary": "The best way to create jobs is to get government out of the way of job creators.\nWe need personal freedom to live life without an overbearing government.\nWe need to defend Kentuckians against overbearing federal regulations like Obamacare and the anti-coal regulations coming from the EPA.\nInstead of adding new programs and new regulations, I will vote to repeal unnecessary programs and regulations, such as overbearing insurance regulations and forced labor representation.\nWe need to reintroduce freedom into the labor market to encourage job creators to create the best possible jobs for Kentuckians."}
