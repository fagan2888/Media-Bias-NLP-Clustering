Bill Pugliano/Getty Images\n\nBusinesses in the U.S. added 204,000 jobs in August, led by broad-based gains across industries and company sizes, according to the ADP National Employment report released Thursday.

Wage gains, which have yet to really materialize, could in turn enable households to pickup their pace of spending and provide a boost to overall growth in the second half of the year.\n\nMark Zandi, chief economist for Moody\u2019s Analytics, called the ADP figure a \u201csolid number,\u201d and the categorized the miss from the consensus estimate as immaterial. He also noted the stable job growth marked a unique aspect in the current recovery compared to past ones.\n\n\u201cIf you go back historically and look at recoveries, it\u2019s more boom-bust like,\u201d Zandi said in a conference call following the report. \u201cYou\u2019d get a period of very rapid job growth and then things cool off significantly. That\u2019s not been the case this go around. Job gains have slowly accelerated.\u201d\n\nDespite the monthly gains, Zandi said the labor market still has \u201ca long way to go\u201d in terms of absorbing sources labor market slack, including long-term unemployed, discouraged workers who have stepped out of the labor force and part-time workers who would prefer to be working full-time.\n\n\u201cEven at the current pace of growth, we\u2019re not going to get back to full employment until late 2016, which by the way would be almost a decade since the last time we were at full employment,\u201d he said. At that point the unemployment rate would be 5.5 percent, he added.\n\nSmall companies of fewer than 50 employees added 78,000 jobs in August, while medium-sized firms with between 50 and 499 employees added 75,000. Large employers with 500 workers or more hired 52,000 more people, the report showed.\n\n[ALSO: Jobless Claims Signal Tightening Labor Market]\n\nThe manufacturing sector added 23,000 jobs in August, the highest reading since December 2012 and well above the 3,000 the month before, the ADP report showed.
