It could result in delays of supplies and important materials. We're still a nation at war.\"\n\n\n\nStivers, appearing for a taping of Capitol Square, specifically mentioned Jim DeMint, president of the conservative think tank Heritage Foundation. DeMint was in Columbus last month pushing Congress to shut down the government to defund Obamacare.\n\n\n\n\"I think he's very wrong,\" said Stivers. \"Tactically, I think he's very wrong. We have the same goal but I think he's tactically wrong, and frankly, if you defund the entire government, one of the only things funded at that point is Obamacare. That's a fact.\"\n\n\n\nOn the issue of Syria, Stivers faults the Obama administration for not having an exit strategy if the nation undertakes a military option.\n\n\n\n\"I've been a military guy for 28 years and the commander\u2019s job is to build a strategy and all the ways that you can use your power to influence that strategy,\" said Stivers. \"We have an international treaty and we need an international response.\"\n\n\n\nThe full interview with congressman Stivers can be seen this Sunday at 11:30 a.m. on 10TVs Capitol Square.\n\n\n\nWatch 10TV News and refresh 10TV.com for more information.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republican congressman Steve Stivers says conservatives should back off calls to shut down the federal government this fall to defund Obamacare.", "og": {"site_name": "WBNS-10TV Columbus, Ohio", "description": "Republican congressman Steve Stivers says conservatives should back off calls to shut down the federal government this fall to defund Obamacare.", "title": "Stivers Says Government Shutdown Wrong Tactic While Nation At War", "url": "http://www.10tv.com/content/stories/2013/09/13/columbus-stivers-opposes-federal-government-shudown.html", "image": "http://www.10tv.com/content/images/government-local/Steve_Stivers.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 100480996669326}, "dfp-id": 8919, "dfp-adunit": "10TV_ROS/10TV_News", "google-site-verification": "oAfV5ExqDpMG7IN3s-onYSMOZYzGcQsWBAOUMvXCw_c", "dfp-targeting": "{\"cat\":[\"news\",\"pol\"]}"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd827c\"", "article_summary": "\"I think he's very wrong,\" said Stivers.\n\"Tactically, I think he's very wrong.\nWe have the same goal but I think he's tactically wrong, and frankly, if you defund the entire government, one of the only things funded at that point is Obamacare.\n\"I do not support a government shutdown, because it defunds our defense department and puts our military soldiers and their families at risk,\" said Stivers.\nOn the issue of Syria, Stivers faults the Obama administration for not having an exit strategy if the nation undertakes a military option."}
