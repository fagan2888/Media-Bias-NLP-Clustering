I keep forgetting to write an uber-post that provides you links so that you can peruse them at your leisure. Not a bad way to start the morning with a slurry of interesting articles:\n\nHuckabee, Cruz and Rand Paul refuse to talk about gay marriage and abortion at big conservative confab in New Hampshire (Buzzfeed):\n\nAt a conservative conference Saturday billed as the \u201cunofficial start\u201d to the 2016 Republican primaries, right-wing heroes Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, and Mike Huckabee competed for activists\u2019 attention with ready-made messages for the movement, replete with Obamacare-bashing, foreign policy tough talk, and more than a few NSA phone-hacking jokes. Conspicuously missing from their pitches: social issues. In a sign of just how marginalized the religious right has become within the Republican Party, not one of the Great Right Hopes positioning themselves for presidential bids at the New Hampshire Freedom Summit \u2014 an event sponsored by Citizens United and the Koch-funded Americans For Prosperity \u2014 tried to rally the crowd with condemnations of same-sex marriage, or abortion. And when reporters asked the prospective candidates about these issues, the replies that came back were feeble and vague, and studded with rhetoric about the importance of big-tent Republicanism.\n\nFull lunar eclipse, overnight Monday to Tuesday, and Mars is going to be insanely bright. (ion) More on the eclipse from CNN \u2013 it should be a \u201cblood moon\u201d during totality for about an hour.\n\nThe Vatican Swiss Guards are reportedly totally gay (Daily Beast). Not surprisingly, there\u2019s some major homophobia linked to the story:\n\nAs a follow-up to the story, Schweiz on Sonntag then interviewed Elmar Mader, a former commander who led the elite force from 2002 to 2008, who seconded the rumors, and went one step further, telling the paper that could not \u201crefute the claim that there is a network of homosexuals\u201d within the Swiss Guard itself. Mader even told the Swiss paper that he purposefully did not promote gay Swiss Guards out of fear that they would be disloyal. \u201cI also learned that many homosexuals are inclined to be more loyal to each other than to other people or institutions. If this loyalty were to go so far as to become a network or even a kind of secret society, I would not tolerate it in my sphere of decision making. Key people in the Vatican now seem to agree.\u201d In the interview, Mader also claimed the Vatican was \u201clike a magnet\u201d for gays, who he said tend to be drawn to all-male environments. He also said that when he retired, he informed the liaison with the Holy See about his concerns of the growing \u201csecret society\u201d and that he feared it might put the pope at risk.\n\nAmerican dry cleaners are still charging women way more than they charge men for the same dress shirts (Wash Post)\n\nThe Russians are attempting to start a civil war in eastern Ukraine, possibly as justification for an invasion (US State Dept.)\n\n49 things you never knew about \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d (I found it interesting \u2013 Buzzfeed)\n\nDid you know that \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d used George W. Bush\u2019s head as one of the impaled-heads in a scene two years back? (NY Daily News, 2012)\n\nA transgender teacher in Texas was asked not to return to work after some parents expressed concerns. She was later reinstated. (Via DKos)\n\nWhy big media companies are afraid to speak out against Comcast\u2019s $45.2bn merger with Time Warner Cable. (Buzzfeed)\n\nPutin is pushing to turn Russia into a (even more) backwards xenophobic hell-hole (NYT):\n\nThere is also now a website with a name that translates as \u201ctraitor.net\u201d that includes photos and quotations of public figures who have spoken out in some way against Russia\u2019s policy toward Ukraine. The bottom of the site has a button inviting viewers to \u201csuggest a traitor.\u201d At Mr. Putin\u2019s direction, a committee led by his chief of staff is developing a new \u201cstate policy in culture.\u201d Widely expected to be enacted into law, the proposed cultural policy emphasizes that \u201cRussia is not Europe\u201d and urges \u201ca rejection of the principles of multiculturalism and tolerance\u201d in favor of emphasizing Russia\u2019s \u201cunique state-government civilization,\u201d according to Russian news accounts that quoted a presidential adviser on culture, Vladimir Tolstoy. A Russian news site, znak.com, also reported last week that a popular series of math textbooks would be dropped from an official list of recommended educational texts because it used too many non-Russian fairy tale and other characters in its illustrations.\n\nEven more from that wacky NYT article about the Russian government losing it:\n\nAnd in a statement last week, the Russian Foreign Ministry warned its citizens not to travel to countries that have extradition treaties with the United States, saying that the Obama administration \u201cis trying to make a routine practice out of \u2018hunting\u2019 for Russian citizens in third countries with the goal of their subsequent extradition and conviction in the U.S. on the basis of, as a rule, questionable charges.\u201d \u2026.\n\nBoris Y. Nemtsov, a longtime political opposition leader and a former deputy prime minister under Boris N. Yeltsin, who also appeared on the banner, wrote on Facebook that the situation seemed worse than during the Cold War. \u201cIn my opinion, even the Soviet Union wasn\u2019t like this,\u201d Mr. Nemtsov wrote. Some of the language on Russian television in recent days has been far more charged than anything heard during Soviet times. One of the country\u2019s most prominent television hosts, Dmitry K. Kiselyov, declaredduring an evening newscast last month that Russia remains \u201cthe only country in the world capable of turning the U.S.A. into radioactive ash.\u201d\n\nHow someone made that really cool, and creepy, animated gif of Emma \u201cHermione Granger\u201d Watson and Sofia Vergara (HuffPo):\n\nFollow @aravosis\n\n(NOTE FROM JOHN: It\u2019s hugely important to our continued success that you share our stories on social media by using the \u201cLike\u201d buttons at the top and bottom of this story to share it on Facebook, Tweeting it to your friends, and sharing it on other services.
