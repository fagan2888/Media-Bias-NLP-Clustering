Politics are confusing. With a playing field this big, it’s hard to know where each of the 2016 presidential candidates stands on the issues.

But the choices these rich old people make directly impact the country we live in, so it’s important to be informed about who you’ll vote for when the election rolls around in November of 2016.

That’s where I come in: No frills, no bias and no bullshit. Just the issues and where each candidate stands.

Rand Paul’s Platform

EXPERIENCE: U.S. Senator for Kentucky; ophthalmologist

ECONOMY

-Rand Paul is unique because he has proposed at least three budgets. Nothing shows your priorities like listing exactly how much you would cut from every government agency! Basically, he wants to decrease all spending, except he would increase defense spending.

-Paul has proposed creating a flat tax (a system where everyone pays the same tax rate regardless of his or her income bracket).

-He has proposed returning to the gold standard (where every dollar in circulation is backed by an equal amount of gold).

GOVERNMENT SIZE

-Rand Paul’s whole ideology can be summed up in two words: small government.

-He has proposed getting rid of the Department of Education, the Department of Energy and the Transportation Security Administration.

-He proposed cutting funding for the Food and Drug Administration and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention.

-Paul’s budget would cut the budgets of more than 10 Cabinet departments by over 28 percent. (Think NASA, National Parks, the National Institute of Health.)

OBAMACARE

-Not a huge fan of Obamacare, but he thinks it “probably can’t be defeated or repealed.”

FOREIGN POLICY

-In Paul’s budget, he proposed increasing defense spending by $190 billion dollars

-He would end all foreign aid, including aid to Israel.

-He has supported negotiations with Iran and believes that the U.S. should avoid military involvement.

IMMIGRATION

-Paul has said that the Republican Party needs to “welcome immigrants”

-Said he would support immigration reform if it includes stricter border security and more visas for agricultural workers.

GAY MARRIAGE

-Says he believes in the traditional idea of marriage but thinks that the decision about gay marriage should be left up to the states.

-A 2013 interview recently resurfaced online, in which Paul said he has never used the term “gay rights” because he doesn’t believe “in rights based on your behavior.”

ABORTION

-In 2010, Paul said he opposes abortion in all circumstances.

-Believes life begins at conception.

-Has refused to comment on this issue since announcing his candidacy.

CLIMATE CHANGE

-Paul thinks climate change is real and humans are causing it, but opposes regulations on carbon dioxide emissions, saying that they would hurt the coal industry.

MEDICAL MARIJUANA

-Paul believes that states should write their own laws about weed.

ISLAMIC STATE

-Paul introduced a resolution formally declaring war against the Islamic State and suggested limiting combat operations to Iraq and Syria.

CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM

-Paul has been a staunch supporter of overhauling the criminal justice system. He wants to allow more felons to vote and to reform sentencing for drug offenses.
