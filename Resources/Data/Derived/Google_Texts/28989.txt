A man and his son found a body a few hundred yards from where they were camping during a weekend grouse hunt in Jackson County.

Michael Spetalieri, and his 14-year-old son on Saturday found the body of a man just off Village Bell Road, about a dozen miles north of Walden.

The boy shot a grouse, and one of their two German Shorthaired Pointers went to fetch it. Instead, the dog found the body, and their second pointer joined the first at the corpse.

“We thought it was an elk … the first thing I noticed was the human skull,” Spetalieri said Sunday. “We had to pull the dogs off it.”

Jackson County Sheriff Gary Cure said about a month ago, an abandoned vehicle was found near the area where the hunters located the body. Cure said he looked for the vehicle’s owner but couldn’t find him.

“We been looking for him. There was an abandoned vehicle up there and it was something strange. We just couldn’t find him until the hunter came across him. We didn’t know if he was missing or he had just dumped his vehicle,” Cure said.

The body was bloated, and Spetalieri noticed a wound in the chest, he said.

Foul play isn’t suspected, Cure said.

Spetalieri and his son spent Saturday night at their camp site, about 400 yards from where they found the body. “It was really creepy for us last night because we had to stay at the camp site,” he said Sunday.
