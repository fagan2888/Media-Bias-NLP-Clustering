The Affordable Care Act provided for states to set up exchanges to sell taxpayer-subsidized insurance coverage. For those states that chose to do so, exchanges would have to be built from the ground up. Studies would have to be done. Contracts would be let.\n\nStay abreast of the latest developments from nation's capital and beyond with curated News Alerts from the Washington Examiner news desk and delivered to your inbox.

By the time Gruber finished his report, Republican Scott Walker had been elected governor and wasn't much interested in using Gruber's study. \"State officials did not invite Gruber to Wisconsin for the release of his study nor did they set up a conference call with him for reporters or even provide them with his contact information,\" the Madison, Wis., Capital Times reported. \"That is unusual for an important report like this, which cost $400,000.\"\n\nIn the two years between March 2011 and March 2013, the state of Minnesota paid Gruber $329,000 to study how to make its exchange conform with Affordable Care Act requirements.\n\nIn 2012, the state of West Virginia signed a contract with Gruber to study its healthcare system. \"The state will pay MIT professor Jonathan Gruber $121,500 to understand the states health insurance landscape and revisit key assumptions about state health care policy,\" the Charleston Daily Mail reported in September of that year. \"Gruber is a policy rock star of sorts. He's advised more than a half dozen states on health care reform.\"\n\nIn November 2011, the state of Vermont hired a consulting firm that used Gruber to study the state exchange. Gruber was paid at least $91,875 for his work.\n\nIn 2012, the state of Michigan included Gruber in a multi-firm, $481,050 contract to study its exchange system. It's not clear how much of that went to Gruber himself.\n\nThe bottom line is that Obamacare has been very, very good to Jonathan Gruber. Now that he is in the news for other reasons, the public is also learning how much he profited from the bill he did so much to promote.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Remember when Nancy Pelosi declared that Obamacare was a jobs bill?
