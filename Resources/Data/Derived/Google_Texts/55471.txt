Republican luminaries like Sen. Marco Rubio and Rep. Paul Ryan are talking a lot lately about helping America’s poor. But according to New York Times columnist and celebrated economist Paul Krugman, until they and other Republicans are willing to change their political priorities in some fundamental ways, Rubio, Ryan and the rest will remain “enemies” of America’s poor.

Republicans, Krugman writes, have difficulty speaking coherently about anti-poverty measures, in large part because of their well-deserved “reputation for reverse Robin-Hoodism, for being the party that takes from the poor and gives to the rich.” To bolster this claim, Krugman notes GOP efforts on the state and federal level to deny the poor healthcare (via Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion) as well as economic support (via unemployment insurance) and education (via public financing for schools). “It’s not much of an exaggeration to say that right now Republicans are doing all they can to hurt the poor,” Krugman writes.

Yet while Krugman is extremely critical of the GOP’s position on anti-poverty measures, he does grant that one Republican claim — that some anti-poverty programs create negative incentives, discouraging the poor from seeking gainful employment — has a kernel of truth to it. “[O]ur patchwork, uncoordinated system of antipoverty programs does have the effect of penalizing efforts by lower-income households to improve their position,” Krugman writes. “[T]he more they earn, the fewer benefits they can collect. In effect, these households face very high marginal tax rates.”
