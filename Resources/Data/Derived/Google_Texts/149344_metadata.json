Consequently, assigning extraordinary priority to passing the Affordable Care Act was a mistake.\n\nIn 2008, most middle class families had private insurance they liked; their incomes had been falling for about a decade.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nThe ACA was really part of Democrats\u2019 agenda to assist the working poor\u2013raising the minimum wage, and expanding Medicaid, food stamps, the earned-income tax credit, and higher education grants\u2013while cozying up to big business to finance Democratic campaigns.\n\nSchumer wants Democrats to advocate big government programs to cure middle class woes, and portray Republicans as servants of big corporate interests. He still embraces the ACA as sound policy, even though it made health care more expensive for many middle class families and it enriches Democratic contributors among top executives and shareholders in the health care industries.\n\nThat\u2019s not surprising\u2013Schumer championed the 2010 Dodd-Frank banking reforms.\n\nThose made compliance with new mortgage and business lending regulations so cumbersome that many regional banks sold out to bigger banks\u2013and lots of decently-paying jobs in smaller city banks were lost. In turn, with more deposits to invest, the Wall Street banks keep finding new scams\u2013like rigging foreign currency markets and speculating in commodities\u2013to keep funding multi-million dollar bonuses for New York executives and big campaign contributions to Democrats in the Senate and House.\n\nCozying up to big business\u2013while championing the poor and offering lip service to the middle class\u2013is what Democrats have done best lately.\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s favorite fund raising venue is the home of Comcast\u2019s CEO, and his Administration has rewarded cable providers with little effort to curb abusive rates, which rise faster than inflation.\n\nNow, the Treasury Department has decided telecom companies may count the wires to homes as real estate and qualify for lower corporate taxes\u2013that\u2019s the kind of special treatment Obama charges is the primary focus of Republicans lawmakers.\n\nSchumer advocating big government will help Democrats win back the middle class and congress. Perhaps with all the staff and privilege a senator enjoys, he has not had to navigate the New York State health insurance exchange, not had his premiums lost and then coverage denied in the ether space of the federal bureaucracy, or waited tediously on the telephone to resolve medical claims.\n\nWhat made Americans prosperous was measured government support to private business, fair play and competition\u2013not monopolies for health insurance companies, banks and cable companies to abuse the public.\n\nSomewhere along the way Washington\u2013and in particular Democrats\u2013forgot private businesses, not government, are the nation\u2019s principal jobs creator, and monopolies stifle progress.\n\nBill Clinton\u2013not a Republican president\u2013normalized trade relations with China, and permitted it to rig its currency, monopolize many manufacturing activities and steal millions of American jobs. Also, he repealed Glass-Steagall, which permitted Wall Street gambling houses to combine with ordinary banks and use middle class savings to create bogus securities and crash the global financial system.\n\nDemocrats have blocked petroleum exploration off the Atlantic, Pacific and Eastern Gulf Coasts, Keystone and other pipeline and infrastructure projects. These limit U.S. oil supplies, enrich big multinational oil companies, and keep OPEC and Russian oil producers in business. In turn, those deny Americans good paying jobs and finance terrorism.\n\nThe new GOP congress should try to reverse those abusive policies. But each step of the way, the Senator from Wall Street will appear on Sunday talk shows to paint Republicans as servants of big business.\n\nOh what a flimflam man\u2013the Senator from Wall Street wants to now present himself as champion of the middle class.\n\nPeter Morici is an economist and business professor at the University of Maryland, and a national columnist.
