Two Republicans, Sens. Saxby Chambliss (Ga.) and Tom Coburn (Okla.), did not vote.\n\nHere are the 17 Republicans who voted to pass the bill:\n\nLamar Alexander (Tenn.) Kelly Ayotte (N.H.) Roy Blunt (Mo.) John Boozman (Ark.) Dan Coats (In.) Thad Cochran (Miss.) Susan Collins (Maine) Mark Kirk (Ill.) Lindsey Graham (S.C.) Orrin Hatch (Utah) John Hoeven (N.D.) Johnny Isakson (Ga.) Jerry Moran (Kan.) Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) Richard Shelby (Ala.) David Vitter (La.) Roger Wicker (Miss.)\n\nHere are the 26 Republicans who voted against the bill:\n\nJohn Barrasso (Wyo.) Richard Burr (N.C.) Bob Corker (Tenn.) John Cornyn (Texas) Mike Crapo (Idaho) Ted Cruz (Texas) Mike Enzi (Wyo.) Deb Fischer (Neb.) Jeff Flake (Ariz.) Chuck Grassley (Iowa) Dean Heller (Nev.) James Inhofe (Okla.) Mike Johanns (Neb.) Ron Johnson (Wis.) Mike Lee (Utah) John McCain (Ariz.) Mitch McConnell (Ky.) Rand Paul (Ky.) Rob Portman (Ohio) Jim Risch (Idaho) Pat Roberts (Kan.) Marco Rubio (Fla.) Tim Scott (S.C.) Jeff Sessions (Ala.) John Thune (S.D.) Pat Toomey (Pa.)\n\nHaving already passed the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, the bill now heads to President Barack Obama\u2019s desk for final approval.\n\nThe House passed the bill Wednesday with an overwhelming 359-67, bipartisan majority.\n\nThe 1,582-page bill funds every agency of government, pairing increases for NASA and Army Corps of Engineers construction projects with cuts to the Internal Revenue Service and foreign aid. It pays for implementation of Obama\u2019s health care law.\n\nShortly before the final vote, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, attacked Senate Democrats, accusing them of ignoring the problems caused by the health care law.\n\n\u201cIt is abundantly clear that millions of Americans are being harmed right now by this failed law,\u201d Cruz said.\n\nUnlike last fall, when he spoke for 21 straight hours and helped force the government shutdown over defunding \u201cObamacare,\u201d this time he clocked in at 17 minutes and simply asked the Senate to unanimously approve an amendment to strip out Obamacare funding. Democrats easily repelled the maneuver.\n\nThe 1582-page bill is really 12 bills wrapped into one in negotiations headed by Rep. Harold Rogers (R-Ky.) and Sen. Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.) respective chairmen of the House and Senate Appropriations committees, and their subcommittee lieutenants.\n\nThey spent weeks hashing out line-by-line details of a broad two-year budget accord passed in December, the first since 2009.\n\nThe bill increases spending by about $26 billion over fiscal 2013, with most of the increase going to domestic programs. Almost $9 billion in unrequested money for overseas military and diplomatic operations helps ease shortfalls in the Pentagon and foreign aid budgets.\n\n\u201cThe Internal Revenue Service, a pariah agency for Republicans after revelations that it targeted tea party groups for tough examinations, would get $500 million less than last year,\u201d the Associated Press reported.\n\n\u201cDemocrats won extra money for Head Start\u2019s preschool programs, enough to serve another 90,000 young children. The Federal Aviation Administration would get less than Congress enacted last year, but enough money was included to avoid 2013\u2032s furloughs and hiring freezes for air traffic controllers,\u201d the report adds.\n\n\u201cThe FBI won extra money, including almost twice as much to help it conduct background checks on firearms purchasers. The National Institutes of Health would get $29.9 billion, about $1 billion above last year\u2019s budget.\u201d\n\nThe bill also halts $20 billion in automatic cuts that would have been applied to the Pentagon\u2019s budget (this would have been in addition to the $34 billion in sequester cuts put in place last year).\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\n\n\n\u2013\n\nFollow Becket Adams (@BecketAdams) on Twitter\n\nThis post has been updated.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "The Democrat-controlled Senate voted 72-26 Thursday to pass a $1.1 trillion \u201comnibus\u201d spending bill to keep government operations funded until Sept. 30.
