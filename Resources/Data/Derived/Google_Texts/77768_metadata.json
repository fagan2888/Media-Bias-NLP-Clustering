But isn\u2019t it true that, at the very least, this massive socialistic monstrosity is providing some people with health insurance? The Obama administration has a new report showing that the uninsured rate has dropped by 35 percent so far. The conservative Heritage Foundation isn\u2019t buying it:\n\nCritics say the report falls short because it is an extrapolation from Gallup surveys instead of being based on hard data. Edmund Haislmaier, senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research group, said the report also doesn\u2019t include essential information on how many people who signed up on exchanges were previously uninsured. \u201cIt\u2019s premature to say it\u2019s ACA related,\u201d Mr. Haislmaier said.\n\nRight, I mean, who can really say? Yes, there has been a sudden and extremely sharp plunge in the uninsured rates among the populations eligible for coverage under Obamacare that begins at the exact time Obamacare took effect:\n\nBut that could be anything. Survey error. People being excited about Republicans winning the midterm. Sunspots. You never know. Probably not the sudden availability of a major new federal health-care law enrolling millions of people.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#000", "description": "Obamacare reducing the number of uninsured is just a theory, like global warming.", "generator": "the-factory", "og": {"site_name": "Daily Intelligencer", "description": "Obamacare reducing the number of uninsured is just a theory, like global warming.", "title": "Conservative Think Tank Won\u2019t Admit Obamacare Reduces the Number of Uninsured", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/03/think-tank-wont-admit-aca-reduces-uninsured.html", "image": "http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2015/03/16/16-baghdad-bob.w1200.h630.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Obamacare reducing the number of uninsured is just a theory, like global warming.", "creator": "@jonathanchait", "image": "http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2015/03/16/16-baghdad-bob.w750.h560.2x.jpg", "title": "Think Tank Won\u2019t Admit ACA Reduces Uninsured", "site": "@intelligencer", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Daily Intelligencer", "fb": {"app_id": 120608177953522}, "msapplication-TileImage": "//cache.nymag.com/media/di/icon.144x144.png", "application-name": "Daily Intelligencer", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "the national interest, politics, obamacare, heritage foundation", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NewYorkMag", "tag": "the national interest,politics,obamacare,heritage foundation", "published_time": "2015-03-16T21:21:00.000Z", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/JonathanChaitPublic"}, "topics": "topics-test, the national interest, politics, obamacare, heritage foundation", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no"}, "article_summary": "The conservative Heritage Foundation isn\u2019t buying it:Critics say the report falls short because it is an extrapolation from Gallup surveys instead of being based on hard data.\nThe Obama administration has a new report showing that the uninsured rate has dropped by 35 percent so far.\nBut isn\u2019t it true that, at the very least, this massive socialistic monstrosity is providing some people with health insurance?\nEdmund Haislmaier, senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research group, said the report also doesn\u2019t include essential information on how many people who signed up on exchanges were previously uninsured.\nProbably not the sudden availability of a major new federal health-care law enrolling millions of people."}
