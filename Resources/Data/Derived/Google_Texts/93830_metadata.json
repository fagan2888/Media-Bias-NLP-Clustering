The clinician rattled off the names of the drugs, the dates they were prescribed, and the doctors who had prescribed them.\n\nThe woman insisted the information was wrong. She recounted the story to her mom, looking for advice. The mother was shocked and embarrassed. Those prescriptions were hers, designed to treat medical conditions she\u2019d been hiding from her daughter. The secret was out, and the women were forced into an emotional conversation about the mother\u2019s ongoing struggles with her health.\n\nThe mother eventually filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, alleging that Aetna had violated her privacy. A government investigation uncovered the cause of the error: The women\u2019s medical records had been mixed up in a database maintained by a supplier to the second-largest U.S. health insurance company. Bloomberg obtained a copy of the HHS investigation, along with nearly a dozen other cases, through a public information request. The details offer a rare look at how the health-care industry\u2019s growing reliance on data mining can go awry.\n\nAetna blamed the mistake on Milliman, a data supplier. In its explanation to the government, Aetna said Milliman described the inaccurate linking of medications as a \u201cvery infrequent occurrence\u201d that sometimes happens when pharmacies make mistakes in coding. Jeremy Engdahl-Johnson, a spokesman for Milliman, declined to comment, citing \u201ca longstanding policy not to comment on our work for clients.\u201d\n\nAetna says it no longer uses Milliman\u2019s IntelliScript data service or other prescription information for determining an individual\u2019s eligibility for insurance, a practice phased out across the health insurance industry as part of President Barack Obama\u2019s health-care overhaul. Aetna says the company does use prescription databases for setting group rates and assessing risk.\n\nGovernment documents show that Aetna hired RSA Medical to call patients about discrepancies between IntelliScript results and what patients had disclosed in their applications. The RSA Medical representative who called the daughter did not know or disclose that the medications belonged to the applicant\u2019s mother. RSA Medical says it complies with all privacy laws.\n\nAetna told HHS that the mother and daughter figured out the link on their own. For this reason, the HHS investigation concluded that no privacy rule was broken. In addition, Aetna and Milliman had a business associate agreement that allowed them to share data on applicants, HHS said. HHS\u2019s Office for Civil Rights closed the Aetna case without finding any wrongdoing.\n\nMedical data is legally shared with more third parties than many Americans realize, said Ifeoma Ajunwa, an assistant professor of law at the University of the District of Columbia. Sensitive information about a patient\u2019s prescriptions and conditions can bounce from one company to the next as part of routine billing or administrative processes. \u201cA major concern with prescription databases is that they provide ample opportunities for invasions of privacy,\u201d Ajunwa said. They are also prone to mistakes.\n\nWhile the mother-daughter mix-up occurred in 2008, insurance companies\u2019 appetite for patient information has increased substantially since then. The medical-data industry is projected to surpass $10 billion by 2020, according to McKinsey & Co. A major driver of that growth is Obamacare. The Affordable Care Act made it illegal for health insurers to reject applicants based on preexisting conditions, but they still use prescription data to set group rates, identify high-risk patients, and decide on corporate budgets. Life insurance companies remain free to use the data to turn away sick people and set higher premiums.\n\nObamacare penalizes health-care providers that don\u2019t shift to electronic records, and it funds statewide exchanges to share the records. The goal is that digitization will eventually allow patient information to quickly synchronize between pharmacies, doctors\u2019 offices, hospitals, and data suppliers, so that a person who normally picks up a medication in San Francisco could get the needed drug if she were to become comatose in a Los Angeles emergency room.\n\nHowever, the emergence of shared medical records makes errors all the more dangerous because they can propagate more easily between providers. Bloomberg reported in 2013 on an 84-year-old woman whose family blames her death at an Abington, Penn., hospital on problems with her electronic health record, which inexplicably dropped a critical heart medication after she was admitted. Scot Silverstein, the woman\u2019s son, filed a lawsuit against Abington Memorial Hospital, which is still pending. The hospital, which is fighting the allegations, declined to comment.\n\nIn 2010, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs took a key feature of its electronic health-records system offline after physicians found the system was slotting medication histories into the wrong patients\u2019 files. The problem was discovered when a doctor noticed that a female patient\u2019s record mistakenly showed a prescription for vardenafil, a drug used to treat erectile dysfunction, according to government documents obtained by Bloomberg. The Veterans Affairs system for accessing Department of Defense medical records electronically and sharing the records between facilities was disabled for three months until technicians could implement a fix. The Veterans Affairs didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. Problems extend outside the U.S. In Australia, a hospital sent the wrong discharge files to physicians in 2011, mixing up patients\u2019 diagnoses and test results.\n\nAmericans file thousands of complaints a year to HHS claiming privacy violations, said Deven McGraw, deputy director for health-information privacy at the health department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights. Many patients protest when they discover that their information is shared with third parties; a frequent target is survey companies, which send detailed questionnaires about treatment to people\u2019s homes.\n\nThe business of providing and securing payment for health care involves potentially hundreds of thousands of entities around the country, said McGraw. Each company must comply with U.S. law covering the secure storage and transfer of electronic data, she said. McGraw encourages patients to request copies of their health records from local providers to ensure accuracy. HHS audits health-care companies\u2019 compliance with privacy and security rules, but knowing where to look for potential problems is difficult. \u201cLike any law enforcement agency, we need to know about violations so that we can help address any issues,\u201d McGraw said. \u201cAnd, of course, like all agencies, we have limited resources to work with, so we need to make sure that we\u2019re maximizing our enforcement efforts.\u201d\n\nDeborah Peel, founder of Austin advocacy group Patient Privacy Rights, says U.S. law is lacking compared with that in Europe, where patients are given more control over what personal information is collected. Patients in the U.S. are entitled to contact holders of their prescription data and review the files for errors, but few know where to start. \u201cThe government may say it\u2019s not a privacy violation, but that\u2019s not how the people experience it,\u201d Peel said. \u201cEven if we wanted to check up on our data, we have no idea who these companies are.\u201d\n\nThe names of the mother and daughter were redacted from the government documents, and their identities could not be learned. It\u2019s also unclear whether they got their records fixed. \u201cThe databases are completely opaque,\u201d Peel said. \u201cThey\u2019re opaque to regulators, and they\u2019re opaque to us.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Jordan Robertson", "twitter": {"description": "Electronic health records are easier to share, and that could be a problem.", "title": "The Pitfalls of Health-Care Companies\u2019 Addiction to Big Data", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-23/the-pitfalls-of-health-care-companies-addiction-to-big-data", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ipdz4Y81t43E/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "site": "@business", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-author": "Jordan Robertson", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "Privacy,patient,health insurance,Companies", "news_keywords": "Privacy,patient,health insurance,Companies", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-23/the-pitfalls-of-health-care-companies-addiction-to-big-data", "parsely-title": "The Pitfalls of Health-Care Companies\u2019 Addiction to Big Data", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-09-23T15:11:53.024Z", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "Electronic health records are easier to share, and that could be a problem.", "parsely-tags": "Privacy,patient,health insurance,Companies,Region: Global,Page: article", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.bwbx.io/business/public/images/favicons/mstile-144x144-bbd2101292.png", "date": "2015-09-23T15:11:53.024Z", "parsely-section": "technology", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "og": {"site_name": "Bloomberg.com", "description": "Electronic health records are easier to share, and that could be a problem.", "title": "The Pitfalls of Health-Care Companies\u2019 Addiction to Big Data", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-23/the-pitfalls-of-health-care-companies-addiction-to-big-data", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ipdz4Y81t43E/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "type": "website"}, "fb": {"status": "Electronic health records are easier to share, and that could be a problem."}, "parsely-post-id": "NV4Y7T6KLVR401", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "parsely-image-url": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ipdz4Y81t43E/v1/-1x-1.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf793\"", "article_summary": "However, the emergence of shared medical records makes errors all the more dangerous because they can propagate more easily between providers.\nPatients in the U.S. are entitled to contact holders of their prescription data and review the files for errors, but few know where to start.\nMedical data is legally shared with more third parties than many Americans realize, said Ifeoma Ajunwa, an assistant professor of law at the University of the District of Columbia.\nThe details offer a rare look at how the health-care industry\u2019s growing reliance on data mining can go awry.\nThe Veterans Affairs system for accessing Department of Defense medical records electronically and sharing the records between facilities was disabled for three months until technicians could implement a fix."}
