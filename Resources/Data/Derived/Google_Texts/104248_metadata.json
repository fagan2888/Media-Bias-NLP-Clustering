The mighty tiger, which can\u2019t change its stripes, is endangered. Some lowly lizards that can change color thrive, which brings us to the subject of Rick Perry\u2019s endorsement of Donald Trump.\n\nOur former governor, whom we elected more times than any in Texas history, didn\u2019t just endorse Trump. He also preened for the job of running mate like a contestant on \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201d\n\nPerry\u2019s candidacies and performance in office seldom pleased and often alarmed this editorial board. But the one thing he did right was repudiate Trump. His assessment of Trump in July as \u201ca toxic mix of demagoguery, mean-spiritedness and nonsense that will lead the Republican Party to perdition if pursued\u201d was not particularly illuminating. Anyone with half a brain, or Perry\u2019s, already knew it.\n\nSaying it is another matter. And who was saying it \u2014 Perry, who\u2019s too far right for conservative \u2014 made it all the more meaningful. Perry preaches states\u2019 rights, mixes Christian fundamentalism and politics, opposes gay marriage and a woman\u2019s right to choose, got flirtatious with secession, was an early adopter of the shockingly nihilistic position of refusing billions of Medicaid dollars connected to the Affordable Care Act, mobilized National Guard troops against little refugee children, and toured blue states to urge their businesses to move to Texas. How much more of that thing that passes for bedrock conservatism can a professional politician be?\n\nNow Perry says that Trump, \u201cnot a perfect man,\u201d nevertheless \u201cloves this country and he will surround himself with capable, experienced people and he will listen to them.\u201d\n\nPerry will not be alone among salamander-like sellouts who adopt this wistful thinking. This is a win-at-any-cost position, divorced from principle, the predictable path of the typical professional politician Trump campaigns against and pretends not to be.\n\nRespect the ones who stick to their principles and reject Trump by supporting Hillary Clinton, a third-party candidate or no one. Those who can take their blinders off and get over Clinton being a Democrat and Mrs. Bill will see that she is much more conservative than Trump. And those who can\u2019t, should check out the presumptive Libertarian nominee, former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson, who describes himself as fiscally conservative, socially liberal and non-interventionist. His fiscal conservatism is a matter of documented New Mexico state history and he favors legalization of drugs, a position shared by some of Ronald Reagan\u2019s closest associates.\n\nNo matter which non-Trump direction they choose, disaffected Republicans have an opportunity to redefine the party from the shambles Trump is making of it. They should consider that some of their principles don\u2019t work in practice if taken too far, and that other principles aren\u2019t principled. For example, too much so-called fiscal conservatism is pound-foolish if the result is a failure to invest in the infrastructure such as highways and the institutions such as education that made the country great. States\u2019 rights in practice is just an excuse for infringing on the individual and civil rights of women and minorities. Same for so-called religious freedom. At the very least, the so-called party of Reagan could try to be more like Reagan \u2014 collaborative and agreeable, not hateful toward those with whom it agrees to disagree.\n\nTrump and Perry, despite their differences, may be compatible because they are similar style-wise. Both have a history of saying attention-getting outrageous things. Both enjoy it. Perry, whose experience includes playing second fiddle to George W. Bush when Bush was governor, is pliable enough to do the same for Trump.\n\nThe traditional wisdom, which hasn\u2019t applied to Trump thus far, is that he needs someone like Perry to reassure the Republican base. Whether Trump buys that or not, he\u2019ll get off to his former repudiator being the minion that Perry has chosen out of opportunism to be.\n\nAnyone else with a shred of self-esteem \u2014 Republican, Democrat, independent, Green, whatever \u2014 should find a Trump-Perry ticket as easy to reject as any Trump ticket.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "news_keywords": "corpus christi caller-times,texas_opinion", "og": {"site_name": "Odessa American", "description": "Adaptability is a useful if not noble survival mechanism in nature and politics.
