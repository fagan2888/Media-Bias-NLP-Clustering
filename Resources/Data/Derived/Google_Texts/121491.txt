ConAgra Foods Snatches Blakeâ€™s All Natural As Better-For-You Trend Persists

Advent International and Snow Phipps have also made healthy food acquisitions recently

ConAgra Foods Inc. (NYSE: CAG) has acquired organic frozen meal business Blake's All Natural Foods.

Blake's headquartered in Concord, New Hampshire, makes natural and organic frozen foods including pot pies, casseroles, pasta dishes and other entrees. Terms of the deal weren't disclosed.

ConAgra says the deal will allow it to provide more choices to people looking for natural and organic foods. The company owns other frozen food lines, including Alexia, Healthy Choice, Marie Callender's, Banquet, Kid Cuisine, Bertolli, Odom's Tennessee Pride and P.F. Chang's.

Stepping away from the frozen foods aisle, ConAgra also owns brands like Hebrew Natural, Orville Redenbacher's, Pam, Peter Pan, Reddi-wip, Slim Jim and Snack Pack.

Food businesses have been picking up better-for-you brands for years to try to keep up with consumer demand for healthier products. Recent purchases include Advent International's acquisition of Noosa Yoghurt LLC in November, and Snow Phipps Group LLC's deal for Teasdale Foods Inc. in October.
