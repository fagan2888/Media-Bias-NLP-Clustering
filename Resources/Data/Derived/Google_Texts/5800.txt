Janeen Hill has little to no privacy at work. That’s on purpose.

Hill is dean of Crean College of Health and Behavioral Sciences at Chapman University’s new Harry and Diane Rinker Health Science Campus, a campus whose design stresses interoffice communication and transparency.

“There are glass walls, even in my office. I am totally exposed,” Hill said. “We encourage collaboration. We should be talking with each other.”

Hill is the former dean of the Schmid College of Science and Technology. Andrew Lyon is the new dean of Schmid College on the Orange campus.

The offices in the new Rinker campus reflect the new health care model, which came about following the passage of the Affordable Care Act. The model emphasizes communication and prevention, as opposed to the old function of health care as mainly disease treatment, Hill said.

“While there will always be a disease component of medical practice, there is a widespread, new shift toward maintaining health and preventing conditions,” she said. “This requires interdisciplinary education and encouraging the medical programs to work with each other.”

The Rinker campus is focused on educating students to work in the new world of health care, in which professionals collaborate across disciplines and technology has a bigger role.

“We want to make sure our students are really ready. We have to ask, how is it our students can learn and adopt evolving technology into their practice?”

The new model of health care also requires new methods backed with research and evidence.

“We really embrace evidence-based practice,” Hill said.
