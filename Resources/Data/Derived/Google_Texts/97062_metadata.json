Tim Roske/Associated Press\n\nNew York is poised to become the first state to allow women who become pregnant to sign up for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act \u2013 even after the open-enrollment period has passed.\n\nLegislation establishing a pregnancy as a so-called qualifying event that enables women to enroll in ACA health coverage at any time passed the New York legislature on Wednesday, and was sent to Gov. Andrew Cuomo for his signature.\n\nDani Lever, a spokeswoman for the governor, said the bill is under review.\n\n\u201cLegislatures will be under tremendous pressure to follow New York,\u201d said New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer. \u201cWe can\u2019t wait for the federal government to act. The fact New York did this his will go a long way of changing the law in many states.\u201d\n\nHe said New York will reach out to other state legislatures in states that run their own exchange to inform them of the need to take similar steps.\n\nHealth care advocacy groups haven\u2019t so far been unsuccessful in getting the Obama administration to allow uninsured women to obtain health coverage on the federal exchange. Currently, women can sign up for coverage as a qualifying event if they have a baby, but not when they become pregnant.\n\nThe New York legislation would allow women in the state who become pregnant to apply for insurance at any time. Health advocates have said the change is needed to enable women to get prenatal care\n\nIn California lawmakers are weighing legislation that would make pregnancy an event that would qualify women to sign up for coverage outside of the health law\u2019s open enrollment season.\n\nCalifornia Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer, both Democrats, have supported the measure and in March wrote to the state exchange encouraging the director to allow pregnant women to obtain health insurance.\n\nGov. Jerry Brown\u2019s office referred questions to the state exchange, Covered California. An exchange spokesman said it was monitoring the legislation and doesn\u2019t have the legal authority to make the change unless the legislature acts.\n\nHealth insurers have pushed back against such a change because they\u2019re concerned it would provide an incentive for women to sign up for coverage only when they become pregnant and need care. They have said that would make coverage more expensive for consumers.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "New York is poised to become the first state to allow women who become pregnant to sign up for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act \u2013 even after the open-enrollment period has passed.", "title": "N.Y.
