So for me to meet people, talk to people, whether it be established fans or new fans, it\u2019s the whole kit and caboodle for me.\u201d\n\nBen Templesmith, best known as the artist of \u201c30 Days of Night,\u201d has been a guest at the Denver event since its debut in 2012. He said he enjoys coming to Denver because the convention still embodies a strong emphasis on comics rather than embrace the glitz and glamour of Hollywood movies, like some other conventions around the country.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still like a grassroot show,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely bigger and it\u2019s a really well-run show. It hasn\u2019t lost its soul.\u201d\n\nLike Pulido, Templesmith enjoys meeting and talking with fans of his work.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not trying to sell myself to anyone new. If they find me, it\u2019s great, but my art should speak for itself. I\u2019m here for the people who know who I am, giving them the face time, thanking them for supporting my work, buying my books,\u201d he said, \u201cand let them know I\u2019m not a scumbag.\u201d\n\nAs writer Fred Van Lente sat at his booth, two men approached him with a stack of comic books to sign. He mentioned his new book \u201cIvar, Timewalker,\u201d is on sale for just $1 apiece. The two men picked up the issues.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great chance not just to make new fans but to sort of introduce fans of one book to another book you may be working on,\u201d Van Lente said.\n\nFor writer and artist Jay Potts, a recent Denver transplant, the convention gives him an opportunity to display his work to a new audience.\n\n\u201cEvery con has its own different feel and different vibe, and this has a very good vibe to it,\u201d Potts said. \u201cPeople are excited about the art, they\u2019re excited about the artists, people are generally looking to try new things.\u201d\n\nJoe Nguyen: jnguyen@denverpost.com or twitter.com/joenguyen", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Denver Comic Con brings creators, fans together", "title": "Denver Comic Con brings creators, fans together", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/05/24/denver-comic-con-brings-creators-fans-together/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150523__20150524_B6_CD24COMICCON3p2.jpg", "height": 459}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150523__20150524_B6_CD24COMICCON3p2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-24T17:40:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T09:54:57+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdab9d\"", "article_summary": "Amid the thousands of costumed heroes who filled the Denver Comic Con at the Colorado Convention Center lies \u201cArtists Valley\u201d where fans can meet the creators of their favorite stories.\nWhile it\u2019s an exciting moment for fans, many of the creators admit they find just as much pleasure in meeting with their audience.\nIt hasn\u2019t lost its soul.\u201dLike Pulido, Templesmith enjoys meeting and talking with fans of his work.\n\u201cInteracting with fans is why I love doing it,\u201d \u201cLady Death\u201d creator Brian Pulido said Sunday.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great chance not just to make new fans but to sort of introduce fans of one book to another book you may be working on,\u201d Van Lente said."}
