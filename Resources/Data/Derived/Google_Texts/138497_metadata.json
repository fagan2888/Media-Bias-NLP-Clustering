You\u2019re constantly selling to customers, investors, even your employees, on the idea that your company is viable and your products worthy of being purchased.\n\nThat\u2019s why the book, Pitch Anything: An Innovative Method for Presenting, Persuading, and Winning the Deal by Oren Klaff, is relevant to you.\n\nPitch Perfect\n\nKlaff knows a thing or two about how to pitch. As Director of Capital Markets for investment bank Intersection Capital, he\u2019s got a long scorecard of helping businesses raise tens of millions of dollars from investors. He\u2019s given and witnessed pitches. He has identified key strategies for helping anyone \u2014 whether you\u2019re raising money or just trying to win over a client \u2014 give a more successful pitch.\n\nGetting Into the Psyche of Your Buyer\n\nToo many people, says Klaff, focus on talking too much about themselves, delivering endless pitches and generally ignoring what their audience wants to know.\n\nIn Pitch Anything, he talks about the \u201ccrocodile brain,\u201d which is the primitive part of the brain your target uses to react to your pitch initially.\n\nThe croc brain is picky and a cognitive miser. Its primary interest is survival. It doesn\u2019t like to do a lot of work and is high maintenance when it is forced to perform. It requires concrete evidence \u2014 presented simply in black and white \u2014 to make a decision. Minor points of differentiation don\u2019t interest it. And this is the brain to which you are pitching.\n\nKlaff provides strategies for appealing to this croc brain using the acronym STRONG:\n\nS et the frame\n\net the frame T ell the story\n\nell the story R eveal the intrigue\n\neveal the intrigue O ffer the prize\n\nffer the prize N ail the hookpoint\n\nail the hookpoint Get the deal\n\nYou\u2019ll have to read the book to learn more about each of these phases, but here are my big takeaways:\n\nKeep your pitch to 20 minutes. If that seems impossible, you\u2019re overinflating your own worth to your audience. You should be able to succinctly explain your \u201cbig idea\u201d in 5 minutes.\n\nDon\u2019t dive too deeply into the technical. You want to bait your audience and get them interested. Later they\u2019ll have questions about the details.\n\nOwn the room. Klaff talks about framing, which essentially is having the upper hand in a given situation. If your audience is late or not paying attention, command respect. Leave if you have to.\n\nWho Should Read this Book\n\nIf you are a startup looking for investors, this book is heavily geared for you. I\u2019m not seeking funding and I still learned plenty from this book.\n\nIf you\u2019re like me and dread sales meetings and pitches, you\u2019ll gain some great strategies in this book that you can put into play immediately.\n\nNominate your favorite small business book in the 2016 Small Business Book Awards today before nominations end on April 27, 2016!", "article_metadata": {"description": "Whether you want to admit it or not, as an entrepreneur, you're in the business of sales.
