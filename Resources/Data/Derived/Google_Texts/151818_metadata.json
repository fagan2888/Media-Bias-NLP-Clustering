We also know a political coward when we see one,\u201d LaPierre said Thursday before a packed auditorium at the 2016 Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC, just outside Washington, D.C.\n\n\u201cPresident Obama, he\u2019s never going to debate me on guns. His knowledge on that issue wouldn\u2019t fill a thimble, and he knows it. I would clean his clock, and he knows it.\u201d\n\nThe Obama administration criticized the NRA in January for skipping a gun control discussion hosted three miles from the gun rights organization\u2019s headquarters. The live town hall, hosted by CNN, served as a platform for the president to garner public support for his executive actions on gun control.\n\nLaPierre challenged Obama a week later to debate him on firearms with \u201cno pre-screened questions and no gas bag answers.\u201d\n\nAt CPAC, he said the president still had not responded to his invitation, and he reissued the offer:\n\nHe\u2019ll keep hiding behind his podium and rigged appearances like all the other truth-dodging politicians, and then he\u2019ll lecture us on what\u2019s wrong with our rights, while day by day, all over this country, more and more people grow more and more disgusted, enraged, and determined to just throw them all out.\n\nThe NRA executive said the president was dodging a one-on-one debate to hide from the \u201csimple truth\u201d that another gun law isn\u2019t going to prevent crimes committed with firearms.\n\n\u201cThe only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is with a good guy with a gun,\u201d LaPierre said. \u201cThe politicians and the media be damned.\u201d\n\nDuring Obama\u2019s presidency, LaPierre said, federal prosecutions of gun crimes dropped dramatically.\n\nThroughout the past year, he said, over 400 persons in Chicago have been shot\u2014a 100-percent increase from the city\u2019s homicide rate at this time last year:\n\nPresident Obama, you know, he brags about what he accomplishes with a pen and a phone. But he refuses, he refuses to pick up either and order his U.S. attorneys to flip Chicago upside down and prosecute every drug dealer with a gun, gang member with a gun, violent felon with a gun to the fullest extent of the existing federal gun laws. If he did that, that would save lives. That would make Chicago safer, but he won\u2019t do that. That doesn\u2019t fit his political agenda to attack the NRA, propel Hillary Clinton into the White House, and to destroy our personal freedom forever.\n\nAt the beginning of the year, Obama issued executive actions expanding background checks for firearms sales and said the government would spend more on mental health care to try to reduce gun-related bloodshed.\n\nLaPierre argued that the gun restrictions would capture only law-abiding citizens, while criminals would slip through the tighter requirements.\n\nRunning through Saturday, CPAC offers conservatives across the country an opportunity to gather with fellow activists and leaders for speeches, panels, exhibits, and other activities at Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center at Maryland\u2019s National Harbor.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201cWe know a liar when we see one.
