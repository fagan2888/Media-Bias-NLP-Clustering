The video, posted in December 2014, has recently become popular, garnering over five million views.\n\nKyle Davis is the name associated with the video, but we\u2019re not certain if he\u2019s the guy who took the video or the one who is getting his ear picked apart. Either way, watching the tweezers pick at the sticky ball of wax until it\u2019s finally jostled out is slightly sickening, but fulfilling at the same time. Imagine how clear his ears must feel now! The man can hear again!\n\nEarwax buildup is common, and while it can be annoying and cause hearing problems or pain, it\u2019s not dangerous. Your body produces earwax (also known as cerumen) to protect your ears; it contains both lubricating and antibacterial properties, according to the Cleveland Clinic. Typically, your ears are able to clear your canals free of wax on their own through chewing and from the skin growing from your ear canals outward. Interestingly, people who shove Q-tips or cotton swabs in their ears are more likely to experience impacted earwax, by pushing the wax farther into the ear than they should.\n\nDespite the fact that this video\u2019s ultimate conclusion results in pure satisfaction \u2014 an enormous slab of earwax is pulled out \u007f\u2014 removing impacted earwax with tweezers isn\u2019t the safest or best way to do it, as it might damage your inner ear. Instead, going to the doctor\u2019s or picking up cerumenolytic solutions from the store are better ways to treat impacted earwax. Cerumenolytic solutions \u2014 such as mineral oil, baby oil, glycerin, or other ear drops \u2014 are used to dissolve wax when they\u2019re poured into the ear canal, according to the Cleveland Clinic.\n\nThis video is gross, but it\u2019s still not as disgusting as the one where the guy pops a gigantic pimple on his neck.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "removing, earwax, ear, has, never, looked, so, gross, yet, satisfying", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Watch this guy get a huge chunk of impacted earwax pulled out of his ear with tweezers.", "title": "The Amount Of Earwax This Guy Removes From His Ear Cannot Be Unseen [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/removing-earwax-ear-has-never-looked-so-gross-yet-satisfying-339114", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/06/19/guy-removing-huge-chunk-earwax-incredibly-gross-yet-satisfying.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Watch this guy get a huge chunk of impacted earwax pulled out of his ear with tweezers.", "title": "The Amount Of Earwax This Guy Removes From His Ear Cannot Be Unseen [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/removing-earwax-ear-has-never-looked-so-gross-yet-satisfying-339114", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/06/19/guy-removing-huge-chunk-earwax-incredibly-gross-yet-satisfying.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/06/19/guy-removing-huge-chunk-earwax-incredibly-gross-yet-satisfying.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-06-19T14:17:42-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-19T14:17:38-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Watch this guy get a huge chunk of impacted earwax pulled out of his ear with tweezers."}, "article_summary": "Instead, going to the doctor\u2019s or picking up cerumenolytic solutions from the store are better ways to treat impacted earwax.\nIt was only a matter of time before the YouTube video of a guy getting a huge amount of impacted earwax yanked out of his ear with tweezers went viral.\nInterestingly, people who shove Q-tips or cotton swabs in their ears are more likely to experience impacted earwax, by pushing the wax farther into the ear than they should.\nDespite the fact that this video\u2019s ultimate conclusion results in pure satisfaction \u2014 an enormous slab of earwax is pulled out \u007f\u2014 removing impacted earwax with tweezers isn\u2019t the safest or best way to do it, as it might damage your inner ear.\nThis video is gross, but it\u2019s still not as disgusting as the one where the guy pops a gigantic pimple on his neck."}
