The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform recently received 20,000 pages of emails of exchanges between this professor and the White House during \u201cthe crucial months when [Obamacare] was being crafted and passed,\u201d writes Charles Lipson for RealClearPolitics.\n\n\u201cI just heard about this,\u201d President Obama said in 2014. \u201c\u2026The fact that some advisor who never worked on our staff expressed an opinion that I completely disagree with, in terms of the voters, is no reflection on the actual process that was run.\u201d\n\nGruber informed the administration \u201cabout interviews with reporters and discussions with lawmakers\u201d and consulted with the administration \u201cabout how to publicly describe his role,\u201d reported The Wall Street Journal. He received at least $400,000 from the federal government, and millions more from state governments for his brilliant advice.\n\nThe mainstream media, as they do with most negative news regarding Obamacare, met this newest revelation regarding President Obama\u2019s obfuscations and lies with a near complete blackout.\n\nAs we recently reported, members of the media not only cover up President Obama\u2019s many lies, they also defend his signature legislation from any threat from any source. Most recently the press has been pressuring the Supreme Court to vote to save Obamacare\u2019s federal subsidies based on the pervasive myth that the legislative text requiring that subsidies be distributed through an exchange \u201cestablished by the state\u201d results from a Congressional drafting error.\n\nCould the impending Supreme Court ruling have influenced editors\u2019 and television news producers\u2019 decisions to ignore this latest information regarding Gruber\u2019s Obamacare role?\n\n\u201cA search of the New York Times shows zero hits for \u2018Gruber\u2019 this week,\u201d writes Lipson. He continues:\n\nThe Washington Post has one hit, a brief comment by an online opinion columnist. Regional newspapers like the Chicago Tribune: zero.\u2026The network shows\u2014Good Morning America, the Today Show, and CBS This Morning\u2014have eight hours of air time but did not mention it at all. Zilch.\n\nAs for MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe, panelists took a moment to have a good laugh at America\u2019s expense, as Accuracy in Media Chairman Don Irvine noted:\n\n\u201cI owe my Republican sources an apology because they kept telling me he [Gruber] was hugely involved, and the White House played it down,\u201d said Mark Halperin, co-managing editor of Bloomberg Politics.\n\n\u201cDid the White House lie about that?\u201d asked Joe Scarborough.\n\n\u201cI think they were not fully forthcoming,\u201d replied Halperin. \u201cOr they may have had their recollections impaired.\u201d\n\nIn other words, President Obama lied.\n\n\u201cMorning Joe\u2019s panel of Democratic stalwarts, including Howard Dean, actually laughed out loud,\u201d writes Lipson. \u201cWhen they were asked the same question\u2014did the White House lie?\u2014they kept laughing and said \u2018they were not fully forthcoming.\u2019\u201d\n\nMaybe if the media didn\u2019t continue to laugh, ignore, or downplay President Obama\u2019s constant lies and instead held him accountable for them, then the President and his administration wouldn\u2019t be able to get away with their transparent disdain for the press, or, apparently, the \u201cstupid\u201d American voter, as Gruber characterized them.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Accuracy In Media", "description": "When it comes to MIT economist Jonathan Gruber\u2019s Obamacare role, the media are making sure that the joke remains on us.", "title": "Media Largely Ignore News of Latest Obamacare Revelation", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.aim.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Obama-Gruber.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-06-25T02:48:51+00:00", "url": "http://www.aim.org/aim-column/media-largely-ignore-news-of-latest-obamacare-revelation/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/AccuracyInMedia/", "section": "AIM Column", "published_time": "2015-06-24T16:26:14+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-25T02:48:51+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "When it comes to MIT economist Jonathan Gruber\u2019s Obamacare role, the media are making sure that the joke remains on us.", "title": "Media Largely Ignore News of Latest Obamacare Revelation", "url": "http://www.aim.org/aim-column/media-largely-ignore-news-of-latest-obamacare-revelation/", "image": "http://www.aim.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Obama-Gruber.jpg", "site": "@AccuracyInMedia", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd767\"", "article_summary": "The mainstream media, as they do with most negative news regarding Obamacare, met this newest revelation regarding President Obama\u2019s obfuscations and lies with a near complete blackout.\nCould the impending Supreme Court ruling have influenced editors\u2019 and television news producers\u2019 decisions to ignore this latest information regarding Gruber\u2019s Obamacare role?\n\u201cMorning Joe\u2019s panel of Democratic stalwarts, including Howard Dean, actually laughed out loud,\u201d writes Lipson.\n\u201cA search of the New York Times shows zero hits for \u2018Gruber\u2019 this week,\u201d writes Lipson.\nWhen it comes to MIT economist Jonathan Gruber\u2019s Obamacare role, the media are making sure that the joke remains on us."}
