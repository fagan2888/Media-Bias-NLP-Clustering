Born with a rare muscular condition, the 6-year-old boy from Palestine has relied on his parents to get around for his entire life. Thanks to orthopedic surgeon Dr. Lawrence Rinsky from Lucile Packard Children\u2019s Hospital at Stanford University, Hadi is now getting his first opportunity to walk on his own after traveling 7,500 miles from Palestine to California.\n\n\u201cAll of these people we have met, they have worked so well together to help Hadi,\u201d Hadi\u2019s mother, Shireen Alkhadra, said in a statement. \u201cThis never could have happened without Dr. Rinsky and Stanford.\u201d\n\nHadi was born with severe arthrogryposis, also known as \u201cstuck joints,\u201d on top of other orthopedic deformities that caused his feet to face the opposite way. Around one out of 3,000 children is born with this condition that causes joints to move abnormally or get stuck in a fixed position. After doctors from Hadi\u2019s home in the Tulkarem refugee camp in the West Bank were unable to treat his condition, the Palestine Children\u2019s Relief Fund put his family in touch with Rinsky who was more than happy to lend a helping hand.\n\n\u201cI said yes, we can treat this young man,\u201d Rinsky told CBS San Francisco. \u201cI was surprised that he hadn\u2019t been treated where he came from. The foot was so deformed that it was upside down. So, he stood on the top of his foot and there was no way to wear shoes.\u201d\n\nFollowing a successful operation, Hadi is now wearing shoes for the first time and can stand flat on his feet. With the help of lower-leg braces and a physical rehabilitation team at Stanford, Hadi is ready to leave his new wheelchair behind and start walking on his own. Next, he looks forward to getting back into school so he can \u201cbe a surgeon, just like Dr. Rinsky.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a very bright young man,\u201d Rinsky said. \u201cHe has a wonderful spirit and is making incredible progress. I think he has a good future ahead of him.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "hadi, alkhadra,7,500. miles, surgery", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A Palestinian boy born with feet facing the opposite direction traveled 7,500 miles to undergo surgery that would allow him to walk for the first time.", "title": "Boy Travels From Palestine To California To Walk For The First Time [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/6-year-old-palestinian-boy-travels-7500-miles-california-surgery-lets-him-walk-first-time-286544", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/05/hadi-alkhadra.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A Palestinian boy born with feet facing the opposite direction traveled 7,500 miles to undergo surgery that would allow him to walk for the first time.", "title": "Boy Travels From Palestine To California To Walk For The First Time [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/6-year-old-palestinian-boy-travels-7500-miles-california-surgery-lets-him-walk-first-time-286544", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/05/hadi-alkhadra.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/05/hadi-alkhadra.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-06-05T10:24:03-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-05T10:24:02-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A Palestinian boy born with feet facing the opposite direction traveled 7,500 miles to undergo surgery that would allow him to walk for the first time."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf9f7\"", "article_summary": "Born with a rare muscular condition, the 6-year-old boy from Palestine has relied on his parents to get around for his entire life.\nThanks to orthopedic surgeon Dr. Lawrence Rinsky from Lucile Packard Children\u2019s Hospital at Stanford University, Hadi is now getting his first opportunity to walk on his own after traveling 7,500 miles from Palestine to California.\n\u201cI said yes, we can treat this young man,\u201d Rinsky told CBS San Francisco.\nHadi Alkhadra has never known what it feels like to stand on his own two feet.\nAround one out of 3,000 children is born with this condition that causes joints to move abnormally or get stuck in a fixed position."}
