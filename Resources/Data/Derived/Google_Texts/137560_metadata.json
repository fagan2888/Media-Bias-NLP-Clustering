A ruling is not expected for a couple of months.\n\nOn Wednesday, Bishop Zubik joined the \u201cKDKA Morning News\u201d with Larry and John from Washington, D.C. shortly before he was to appear in front of the Supreme Court.\n\nHe said he is not taking issue with all of Obamacare and the idea that as an employer, the church needs to provide healthcare to their employees.\n\n\u201cThe Catholic Church has long been supportive of healthcare for everybody and I think by and large we were very supportive of the Affordable Health Care Act. It was this particular mandate that goes against our principles,\u201d said Zubik", "article_metadata": {"description": "Pittsburgh Catholic Diocese Bishop David Zubik is taking the United States government to court on Wednesday.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/2016/03/22/bishop-zubik-heads-to-washington-dc-to-challenge-part-of-affordable-care-act/", "image": {"width": 770, "secure_url": "https://cbspittsburgh.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/zubik.jpg?w=770", "identifier": "https://cbspittsburgh.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/zubik.jpg?w=770", "height": 433}, "type": "article", "description": "Pittsburgh Catholic Diocese Bishop David Zubik is taking the United States government to court on Wednesday.", "title": "Bishop Zubik Heads To Washington, D.C.
