Because month-to-month data can get a little noisy, I thought it\u2019d also be worth looking at the numbers in an annual context.\n\nAbove is a separate chart showing job growth by year for the four most recent presidential administrations \u2013 the blue columns point to the two Democratic administrations (darker blue for overall job growth, lighter blue for private-sector-only growth), and the red columns point to the two Republican administrations (darker red for overall job growth, lighter red for private-sector-only growth).\n\nThe point is, 2014 isn\u2019t just an encouraging year as compared to other years in the Great Recession era; it\u2019s actually a strong year on its own. Indeed, more jobs have been created this year than in any year of the Bush/Cheney era \u2013 or the Bush/Quayle era, for that matter.\n\nThe Clinton era is, for good reason, generally seen as the best American economic period in recent memory, and the above image certainly helps show why. But take a closer look and you\u2019ll notice this year\u2019s job growth is actually stronger than two of the eight Clinton years.\n\nNot too shabby.\n\nAlso keep in mind, 2014 isn\u2019t over yet. If current trends continue, we\u2019re likely to see strong job growth again in December, which means this year will look even better. It\u2019s already the best year since 1999.\n\nI\u2019ll be eager to hear the reaction to the data from congressional Republicans \u2013 you know, the \u201cWhere are the jobs?\u201d folks \u2013 who will probably find the numbers very hard to explain. Remember, as far as GOP lawmakers are concerned, President Obama\u2019s agenda of health care reform, burdensome regulations, and the Affordable Care Act are crushing the domestic economy, stifling the job market like a \u201cwet blanket.\u201d\n\nAnd yet, here we are.\n\nMaking matters worse for the White House\u2019s critics, today\u2019s job report also showed increased wages and a U6 jobless rate \u2013 Fox News\u2019 favorite \u2013 at a six-year low.\n\nIf this were happening under President Romney, the RNC would be organizing parades in his honor.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "This year, more jobs have been created than any year of the Bush/Cheney era.
