The five major investor-owned hospital companies recorded significant gains in volume, revenue and profits in the last three months of 2014.The companies generally reported that the number of paying patients increased in tandem with the economic recovery in full swing and the health insurance expansions under the Affordable Care Act.The results, along with quarterly reports of hundreds of the largest not-for-profit systems, are available in the Modern Healthcare Health System Financial Database

The positive trends for the for-profit hospital companies have been most pronounced in states that opted to expand Medicaid eligibility under the healthcare reform law. Tenet Healthcare Corp. said its uninsured and charity admissions declined 62.4% in the five Medicaid expansion states where the company operates hospitals.HCA, the largest U.S. hospital chain by revenue, enjoyed a 24% rise in its fourth-quarter net income in 2014 compared with the same period a year earlier. The company has much at stake, however, in states that are relying on HHS to operate their exchanges and could have their subsidies ended by the Supreme Court's decision in King v. Burwell.
