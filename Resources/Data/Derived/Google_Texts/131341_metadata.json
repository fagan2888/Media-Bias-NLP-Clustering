We've also got to support you.\"\n\nThe exhibitions included things like ball-throwing robots, technology to tackle cyber-bullying, an Alzheimer's monitor for Gramps, an Ethiopian water filtration system, a \"pollution-into-power battery,\" hiccup-curing lollipops, and a quadrilingual kid team\u2019s sustainable city of the future.\n\nBut the posse that took the science fair by storm was a team of six-year-old girls sporting shiny red Superman capes.\n\nphoto credit: NBC News\n\nThe \"Supergirls\" Junior FIRST Lego League Team from Daisy Girl Scouts' troop 411 came to the White House toting a battery-powered page-turning device constructed out of Legos, fabricated to assist readers who are paralyzed or arthritic.\n\nWhile perusing the exhibits, the president stopped and chatted with the five munchkins. After all, if these kids could come up with a novel version of a handicapped page-turner, just think of what they could do for a Teleprompter-addicted president with an annoying tendency to mimic a bobble-head.\n\nAs he strolled past the Supergirl exhibit, the president leaned over to speak to the pint-sized kindergarteners about their invention. Obama asked Emily, Alicia, Karissa, Addy, and Emery how they came up with their idea, to which the chirpy girls responded that they had settled on their exhibit after they \"brainstormed.\"\n\nFirst of all, Obama chatting and then giving a group hug to a bunch of kids \u2013 the abortions of whom he wouldn\u2019t have had a problem with six years earlier \u2013 is sort like Paul Bunyan being a guest of honor at an Arbor Day event. Still, the giggly group had a few questions for the guy who would have applauded their pre-born demise.\n\nRight after the child-loving/pro-abortion president told them he was \"thrilled to have them,\" the girls asked him, \"Have you ever had a brainstorming session yourself?\"\n\nReminiscing about his failed border security brainstorming sessions with Desperate Latina Housewife Eva Longoria, in a rare moment of frank honesty, Obama said, \"I have had a couple of brainstorming sessions, but I didn't come up with anything this good. You guys are already better brainstormers than I am.\"\n\nHonestly, five little Supergirls getting the haughty Barack Obama to admit that he \"didn't come up with anything this good\" is a much more impressive accomplishment than cooking up a Lego science project, don't you think?\n\nNext, the little scientists asked him, \"What did you come up with?\" To which the man who told every business owner in America \"You didn\u2019t get there on your own \u2026 you didn\u2019t build that\" actually said, with a straight face, \"You know, I came up with things like, you know...health care.\"\n\nThen, awkwardly shrugging his shoulders, Obama unconvincingly mumbled, \"It turned out okay, but it...started out with some prototypes.\"\n\nSorry, Mr. President, but the Obamacare mockup is a disaster crying out to be returned to the drawing board.\n\nEither way, there it is! As if Obama's failed policy could hold a candle to a Lego page-turner for the handicapped, White House science fair wannabe Barack Obama attempted to one-up five little girls by bragging that he invented Obamacare.\n\nJeannie hosts a blog at www.jeannie-ology.com.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2015/03/barack_obama_and_the_supergirls.html", "image": "http://www.americanthinker.com/images/bucket/2015-03/194299_5_.jpg", "title": "Blog: Barack Obama and the 'Supergirls'"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0696\"", "article_summary": "Honestly, five little Supergirls getting the haughty Barack Obama to admit that he \"didn't come up with anything this good\" is a much more impressive accomplishment than cooking up a Lego science project, don't you think?\nSounding more like he was advancing the concept of \"sharing the wealth\" than congratulating a group of aspiring scientists, Obama told science fair participants, \"It's not enough for our country just to be proud of you.\nAs if Obama's failed policy could hold a candle to a Lego page-turner for the handicapped, White House science fair wannabe Barack Obama attempted to one-up five little girls by bragging that he invented Obamacare.\nBut the posse that took the science fair by storm was a team of six-year-old girls sporting shiny red Superman capes.\nBarack Obama couldn\u2019t make it to Bibi Netanyahu\u2019s address to a joint session of Congress, but he did squeeze in an appearance at the fifth annual White House science fair, which he said is the \"most fun event of the year.\""}
