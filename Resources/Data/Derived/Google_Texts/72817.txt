Ann Callis says she has talked to people throughout the 13th congressional district during her campaign and one theme comes through loud and clear.

"It all comes down to jobs. People want good, livable wage jobs," she said. The Democratic candidate stopped in Springfield Wednesday to attend party events in connection with the Illinois State Fair.

"(People) worry about their future. I hear from college students. They worry about student loans. From people that have graduated, they worry about student loan debt."

Callis is a former judge from Edwardsville. She faces freshman Republican Rodney Davis of Taylorville, If elected, she says on Day 1, she will begin forming coalitions to enhance and promote apprenticeship programs.

She says there are young men and women looking for jobs, but they lack the training. She says the way to improve the situation is through public-private partnerships. She says renewable energy is a growing area that Illinois is poised to take advantage of. Callis also supports raising the minimum wage.

On the topic of Obamacare, Callis says people are concerned about rising health care premiums. She says bringing people in to her office to explain the problems they are facing can build empirical evidence to improve the current law.

Congress adjourned without dealing with the immigration issue, including the problem at the border of unaccompanied children being sent in to the country. She says a bi-partisan approach is needed to make it a top issue for the next Congress.
