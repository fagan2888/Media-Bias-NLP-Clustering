Where a Baltimore woman whose last job paid $11 an hour grapples with long-ago college loans. And where a 39-year-old tile setter who can\u2019t find enough work lives with his wife and daughter in his parents\u2019 basement.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see where the recession has been over,\u201d said Willie Rose, the tile setter from Calvert County. \u201cMaybe on Wall Street, but not for the real person.\u201d\n\nNearly half of Marylanders say their family finances are no better now than they were two years ago, according to a recent Washington Post-University of Maryland poll. A quarter say they are worse off \u2014 even with the economy rebounding from a painful recession. And this is in a state with the nation\u2019s highest median household income and concentration of millionaires.\n\nView Graphic Poll: Maryland's economic malaise\n\nThose who are financially stressed were more likely to vote for Hogan over Democrat Anthony G. Brown in November than those who say they are getting ahead, according to the poll. On the campaign trail, Brown, then the lieutenant governor, talked about how Maryland had thrived for eight years under Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley (D). But Hogan, the prosperous owner of a real estate firm, painted a different picture, one that resonated with residents who were less fortunate.\n\n\u201cToo many Marylanders,\u201d the new governor said in his first State of the State address, \u201chave been struggling, just to get by.\u201d\n\nProblems lurking\n\nBy many measures, Maryland\u2019s economy is doing much better than most states: Its residents are well-educated \u2014 9 in 10 have a high school diploma, and 16 percent have advanced degrees, one of highest rates in the nation. The median household income is more than $73,500, tops in the country. Maryland\u2019s credit rating remains strong even as bond issuers have downgraded other states.\n\nBut there are problems lurking: The federal government is one of Maryland\u2019s largest employers \u2014 a life jacket during the recession that has become a liability as federal funding is slashed. Although the state has recovered all of the jobs lost during the economic slowdown, that rebound was largely focused in more-affluent areas; statewide, job creation has slowed.\n\nGiven how educated Marylanders are, some say the state\u2019s unemployment rate should be among the lowest in the nation \u2014 rather than just below the national average. The state\u2019s gross domestic product stagnated in 2013, the most recent year it was measured. Tax revenue is lower than projected, which has led to budget cuts. And \u2014 as with the rest of the country \u2014 there\u2019s an ever-growing chasm between Maryland\u2019s wealthiest residents and its poorest.\n\nJ.B. Ball, 55, a senior engineer at Patuxent River Naval Air Station, sees this gap each month as he waits for rent checks from tenants at the seven homes he owns in St. Mary\u2019s County. Ball, a Republican who voted for Hogan, has rented to some of his tenants for years \u2014 including a dad who works two or three jobs at a time to support six kids.\n\n\u201cThese are good people who are struggling to get by,\u201d said Ball, echoing Hogan\u2019s State of the State speech without realizing it. \u201cThey\u2019re late every month. By the terms of my lease, I should be charging them late fees. But I can\u2019t bring myself to do it.\u201d\n\nBetween 2009 and 2013, personal income in Maryland grew more slowly than the national average, according to an analysis by the state Department of Planning. When adjusting for inflation, Maryland saw a slight decrease in income for 2013, one of the worst performances in the country.\n\nIncreases in the cost of living have forced many Marylanders to rein in their spending or take on more debt. Dick Willis, a 70-year-old Navy veteran from Gaithersburg, can\u2019t afford a cellphone. He and his wife of 42 years don\u2019t splurge on dinner at Outback Steakhouse or on a movie date. The couple refinanced their mortgage to pay other bills and won\u2019t finish paying it off for at least two decades. When disaster hits \u2014 like the pipe that burst in their basement \u2014 they struggle to find cash.\n\n\u201cIf all of my bills go up, no one says, \u2018We should raise his retirement check, and we should raise his Social Security so that he can keep up with Montgomery County and Maryland,\u2019 \u201d said Willis, a Republican who voted for Hogan. \u201cIt\u2019s not rosy in this state. I don\u2019t care how they paint it.\u201d\n\nFocus on taxes\n\nOn the campaign trail last year, Hogan emphasized three things that he says will boost the economy: cutting waste, rolling back taxes and making the state more business-friendly. Maryland, he repeatedly said, was on the wrong track.\n\nAccording to The Washington Post-Maryland poll, many voters agreed with Hogan\u2019s focus on taxes, including substantial numbers of Democrats and independents. More than 6 in 10 Hogan voters say that for all of the taxes they pay, they don\u2019t feel as if they are getting a big enough bang for their buck.\n\nHogan voters were about twice as likely to describe themselves as not being well off as those who cast their ballots for Brown, 32 percent vs. 17 percent. Their support for Hogan reflected a political shift that is happening across the nation, with Republican politicians making inroads among working-class voters, in part by trying to define Democrats as the party of the educated elite.\n\nYet Marylanders overall are divided on whether they are willing to sacrifice funding for key state programs to see taxes reduced. Forty-eight percent say the state should focus on boosting its economy through lower taxes on businesses and individuals, while 46 percent place greater priority on paying for rising education and transportation costs.\n\nAs governor, Hogan continues to hammer on the financial uncertainty percolating in the state, sometimes angering Democratic leaders by using exaggerated or outdated statistics. He and the legislature have embarked on a four-year race to create jobs, boost wages and bring more state residents into a higher economic bracket.\n\nHogan has introduced legislation to halt automatic gas-tax increases\u00ad, stop taxing military pensions and eliminate personal property taxes for small businesses. Democrats, in turn, have proposed bills to boost the state\u2019s economic development department, profit from university research and increase apprenticeships, while urging more money for public transportation and education.\n\nBut jump-starting a sluggish state economy is no easy task.\n\nThere are basically three ways to create private-sector jobs: support companies already in the state so they stay put and hire more people; entice businesses\u00ad from elsewhere to move in; and encourage new companies to start up.\n\nHogan has said that simply having a Republican governor will set a different tone in Maryland. Shortly after taking office, he ordered the installation of highway signs announcing: \u201cWe\u2019re open for business.\u201d\n\nFor now, rankings of business-friendly states usually put Maryland in the middle or bottom half of the pack \u2014 far behind neighboring Virginia, a right-to-work state with a corporate income tax rate of 6 percent, compared with Maryland\u2019s 8.25 percent. Maryland has only four Fortune 500 companies, according to the latest count, compared with more than 20 each in Virginia and Pennsylvania.\n\nThere\u2019s no single \u201cgame-changing\u201d thing that Maryland can do, said R. Michael Gill, Hogan\u2019s secretary of business and economic development. Many business owners complain about the state\u2019s onerous regulations and slow bureaucratic machinery, he said, which are among the first things he plans to tackle.\n\nOther changes will be more difficult. The corporate income tax rate is too high and will eventually need to come down, he said, although that could initially mean less tax revenue, so the state must first get spending under control. Tax-incentive programs are necessary to attract new business, Gill said, but the current offerings need review \u2014 including a film tax credit that gives millions to the makers of the Netflix show \u201cHouse of Cards.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to fire on many, many cylinders,\u201d Gill said.\n\nHad faith in the system\n\nSuch long-term fixes offer little immediate hope to people such as Yvonne Gordon, the 60-year-old unemployed woman from Baltimore who is still paying off loans for a college degree she earned in her 30s.\n\nFor 12 years, Gordon worked in customer service for a major transportation company, watching her pay grow from about $7 an hour to $11. She lost her job in 2012. Now she and her husband live on his salary from the city, where he does utility work.\n\nShe has been applying for jobs but finding none. Every Saturday, she attends a training program at a church that she said often doubles as a support group.\n\n\u201cI put my faith into the system because I thought if you worked hard, you could get ahead,\u201d said Gordon, a registered Democrat who didn\u2019t vote in November. \u201cBut that\u2019s not how it has worked for me.\u201d\n\nFinancial stability also seems unattainable now for Rose, the tile setter from Calvert. Construction work dried up during the recession. It has started to pick back up, but not nearly enough to dig himself out of debt. His pay has fallen from $1,500 per week in good times to $500 \u2014 if he\u2019s lucky.\n\nRose, his wife and their 6-year-old daughter rely on food stamps and subsidized health insurance through the Affordable Care Act. He struggles to save for Christmas presents, let alone retirement.\n\n\u201cI just keep hoping things will get better,\u201d said Rose, who usually votes for Democrats but cast his ballot for Hogan. \u201cOr maybe we will hit rock bottom and politicians will have to do something.\u201d\n\nScott Clement contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In a new poll, Hogan voters especially said the state\u2019s wealth doesn\u2019t reflect their struggles to make ends meet.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/wpjennajohnson", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "In a new poll, Hogan voters especially said the state\u2019s wealth doesn\u2019t reflect their struggles to make ends meet.", "title": "In Maryland, economic angst breaks through the veneer of a wealthy state", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/in-maryland-economic-angst-breaks-through-the-veneer-of-a-wealthy-state/2015/02/28/4a8b6a06-bcee-11e4-bdfa-b8e8f594e6ee_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/02/11/Local-Politics/Images/State_of_Maryland_-0da38.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@wpjenna"}, "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "mdpolitics, hogan, economy, maryland economy, martin omalley, larry hogan, maryland taxes, maryland business, mike gill, r michael gill, maryland gdp, anthony brown", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/wpjennajohnson"}, "eomportal-uuid": "4a8b6a06-bcee-11e4-bdfa-b8e8f594e6ee", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "mdpolitics, hogan, economy, maryland economy, martin omalley, larry hogan, maryland taxes, maryland business, mike gill, r michael gill, maryland gdp, anthony brown"}, "article_summary": "Democrats, in turn, have proposed bills to boost the state\u2019s economic development department, profit from university research and increase apprenticeships, while urging more money for public transportation and education.\nThis is the Maryland that propelled Larry Hogan, a wealthy businessman who had never held elected office, into the governor\u2019s mansion.\n\u201cThese are good people who are struggling to get by,\u201d said Ball, echoing Hogan\u2019s State of the State speech without realizing it.\nThere\u2019s no single \u201cgame-changing\u201d thing that Maryland can do, said R.
