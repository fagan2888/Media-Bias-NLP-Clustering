But this last Obamacare rewrite is especially worth noting.\n\nI am not just talking about the president\u2019s (latest) illegal waiver of the employer mandate, which yet again delays (this time, to 2016) the requirement that businesses with 50 to 99 employees must provide Obama-certified coverage or pay crushing fines \u2013 a desperate political calculation to accommodate Democrats who face angry voters this November. I am talking about the other bomb administration officials dropped in announcing this unconstitutional edict.\n\nObama\u2019s central-command policies are inevitably crashing into each other. The waiver may provide some relief to endangered Democrats, but it also gives employers an incentive to lay off employees in order to get under 100 and qualify for the illegal waiver. So Obama has unilaterally legislated illegal conditions on the illegal waiver. To wit, employers will be required to certify to the IRS, under penalty of perjury, that the waiver was not a motivating factor in the company\u2019s hiring and firing decisions. As Fox News\u2019s Chris Stirewalt quips, \u201cTo avoid ObamaCare costs you must swear that you are not trying to avoid ObamaCare costs.\u201d\n\nSo now Obama, like a standard-issue leftist dictator, is complementing lawlessness with socialist irrationality.\n\nThink about how lunatic this is. There is nothing even faintly illegal about businesses\u2019 \u2013 indeed, all economic actors\u2019 \u2013 making financial decisions based on tax consequences. (And remember, notwithstanding Obama\u2019s misrepresentations to the contrary, Obamacare mandates are taxes, as Obama\u2019s Justice Department argued and as Chief Justice Roberts & Co. concluded.) The tax consequences of Obamacare are profound; that is precisely the reason that Obama is \u201cwaiving\u201d them. No responsible officers in a corporation of relevant size would fail to take them into account in making the decision to staff at over or under 100 employees; in determining whether some full-time employees should be terminated or shifted to part-time; or in making any number of the decisions Obamacare\u2019s mind-numbing complexity requires.\n\nThe officers\u2019 responsibility is to the owners of the company, the shareholders. The business exists to create value, not to provide employment \u2013 employing workers is a function of the value added to the enterprise, not the need to create a more favorable election environment for the statist political party. Corporate officers who overlooked material tax consequences would be unfit to be corporate officers.\n\nWhat is illegal and irrational is not a company\u2019s commonsense deliberation over its costs, it is Obama\u2019s edict. And look what attends this one: criminal prosecution if Obama\u2019s Justice Department decides the business has falsely certified that its staffing decision was not motivated by Obamacare.\n\nThink about that for a second. The waiver is illegal. It flouts the language of the Obamacare statute, under which the employer mandate is required already to have been implemented by now. There is nothing in the law that empowers Obama to waive the mandate, much less to attach lawless conditions to such a lawless waiver. A business that seeks the waiver and fails to pay the mandated tax (in lieu of providing the required coverage) is in violation of federal statutory law, regardless of its compliance with Obama\u2019s outlaw edict. The payments required by the statute, after all, are owed to the public, not to Obama \u2013 he\u2019s got no authority to deprive the government of these funds just because it would harm Democrats to collect them.\n\nYet, Obama proclaims his illegal waiver with impunity \u2013 Congress apparently unwilling to stop him. You, on the other hand, will be prosecuted for breaking the \u201claw\u201d if you do not comply to Obama\u2019s satisfaction with the illegal and irrational condition he has unilaterally placed on his illegal waiver.\n\nGot that?", "article_metadata": {"tweettext": "Obama Adds Irrationality To Lawlessness \u2014 While Threatening Prosecution", "sailthru.author": "Andrew C.
