United Health Services’ Acute Care Revenue Increases in 1Q15

Universal Health Services’ performance

In 1Q15, Universal Health Services’ (UHS) acute care segment delivered an EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization) margin of 21.6%—a 140 basis point YoY (year-over-year) improvement.

Universal Health Services’ acute care segment registered 18% growth in total revenue—from $971 million in 1Q14 to $1,146 million in 1Q15. In the same timeframe, the segment’s same-store revenue increased by 12.2% YoY. This was in excess of the 7%–8% revenue growth for the acute care segment, projected in the company’s 2015 guidance. Same-store indicators assume that Universal Health Services operated the same group of acute care hospitals in 1Q14 and 1Q15. As a result, these indicators exclude the impact of acquisitions on the overall performance.

Enrollment growth

Universal Health Services’ acute care segment witnessed a 5.7 % YoY rise in adjusted admissions in 1Q15. Adjusted admissions is a metric that’s used to calculate the total inpatient and outpatient admissions in a hospital. The number of patient days per adjusted admission also increased by 7.5% in 1Q15—compared to 1Q14. The company also registered a 6.1% increase in revenue per adjusted admission, mainly due to an improvement in the company’s inpatient surgical growth in 1Q15.

Other companies in the for-profit hospital industry (XLV) like HCA Holdings (HCA), Community Health Systems (CYH), and LifePoint Hospitals (LPNT) are also expected to register high acute care admissions in 1Q15. This trend is mainly the result of an overall increase in the percentage of the insured population due to the implementation of the provisions in the Affordable Care Act.

In 2015, Universal Health Services attributed about a 35%–40% improvement in acute care performance to the impact of the Affordable Care Act, 35%–40% to economic improvement in markets, and 15%–20% to the company’s market share improvements in individual markets.
