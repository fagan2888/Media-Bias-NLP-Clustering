These Members have articulately described why they don\u2019t want to force taxpayers to fund the destruction of babies, and why certain leadership strategies are inherently flawed.\n\nWhat they have yet to explain is how their strategy is actually going to work. Even when leadership suggested using reconciliation to get a defunding bill to President Obama\u2019s desk, thereby at least getting Obama to publicly veto a bill that protects unborn babies from illegal fetal harvesting and illegal abortions, Cruz and the rest immediately assailed the effort as not good enough.\n\nBut using a Continuing Resolution won\u2019t even get to Obama\u2019s desk, thanks to Senate Democrats\u2019 obsession with forcing taxpayers to fund abortion. And then the government will partially shut down, Planned Parenthood will get 80% of its current funding thanks to Medicaid, and the media will have all the excuse it needs to continue focusing on internal GOP fights instead of Planned Parenthood\u2019s abhorrent practices.\n\nSo, again: What\u2019s next, folks?\n\nI asked this question to two GOP leadership offices, as well as the offices of two Members who support the Cruz strategy (which, like the 2013 Obamacare effort, appears more about promoting Cruz than solving any problems). None responded before this post went live, but one GOP aide did tell me that \u201ca CR with defund won\u2019t get to the president\u2019s desk. Reconciliation will. So right there the needle is moved; the issue furthered.\u201d\n\nLikewise, another aide said \u201ctwo years ago, the very same group of members went down this path without a strategy to win and later publicly admitted they made a mistake. If they want people to follow them again, they have a responsibility now to clearly define their endgame.\u201d\n\nOne prominent critic of the reconciliation strategy did get back to me \u2014 Paul Winfree, the Director of the Thomas Roe Institute at The Heritage Foundation. When I said that a CR can\u2019t touch mandatory spending (which is where Medicaid is qualified), he corrected me:\n\nThere hasn\u2019t been an appropriations bill in recent memory that did not make some changes to mandatory programs. A CR is an appropriations bill. For instance, pretty much all the recent appropriations bills have reduced S-CHIP bonus payments to states. Recent appropriations bills have also made sure money is available for TANF and SNAP after the authorizations for those programs expired.\n\nWinfree\u2019s colleague Sarah Torre wrote about this in August, saying that \u201cunlike other entitlement spending, Congress actually funds the Medicaid program through the appropriations process each year.\u201d She also pointed to the attachment of the Hyde Amendment to annual HHS appropriations.\n\nBut the question still remains \u2014 what\u2019s next after Senate Democrats stop a CR, and the government partially shuts down? Planned Parenthood will get most of its funding, that\u2019s what. And the GOP leadership (especially in the Senate) will have all the reason it wants to keep breaking campaign promises, and to continue punting on protecting the unborn from slaughter.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "What\u2019s the plan, folks?", "title": "Do Cruz and the House Freedom Caucus have an end game?", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2015/09/20/do-cruz-and-the-house-freedom-caucus-have-an-end-game/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@JazzShaw"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-20T18:31:35+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-20T17:02:01+00:00"}, "keywords": "abortion, house freedom caucus, Planned Parenthood, pro-life, Ted Cruz,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb3ca\"", "article_summary": "Do Cruz and the House Freedom Caucus have an end game?\nA CR is an appropriations bill.\nAnd the GOP leadership (especially in the Senate) will have all the reason it wants to keep breaking campaign promises, and to continue punting on protecting the unborn from slaughter.\nI asked this question to two GOP leadership offices, as well as the offices of two Members who support the Cruz strategy (which, like the 2013 Obamacare effort, appears more about promoting Cruz than solving any problems).\nBut the question still remains \u2014 what\u2019s next after Senate Democrats stop a CR, and the government partially shuts down?"}
