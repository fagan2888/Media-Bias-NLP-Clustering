The program at Potomac Mills runs through the 13th.\n\n\u201cFor many children, the gifts they receive through Angel Tree are the only ones they will open on Christmas,\u201d a statement released by the Salvation Army reads.\n\n\u201cParents totally get to keep their dignity [with this program],\u201d Woods says. \u201cSo [when you donate,] you really are an angel.\u201d\n\nTo find out if the Angel Tree program is operating in your community, please visit your local Salvation Army website.", "article_metadata": {"description": "With the Angel Tree toy drive, the Salvation Army collects and donates gifts to poor children who think their parents (or Santa) are responsible.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "With the Angel Tree toy drive, the Salvation Army collects and donates gifts to poor children who think their parents (or Santa) are responsible.", "title": "This Program Helps Underprivileged Children Believe in Santa", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151222_AngelTree.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-12-22T14:55:24+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1HWMyX2"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "With the Angel Tree toy drive, the Salvation Army collects and donates gifts to poor children who think their parents (or Santa) are responsible.", "title": "This Program Helps Underprivileged Children Believe in Santa", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151222_AngelTree.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "civil society", "published_time": "2015-12-10T12:45:58+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-22T14:55:24+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Christmas, holidays, Salvation Army, needy families, Christmas presents, donations, volunteering, underprivileged children"}, "article_summary": "WOODBRIDGE, Va.\u2014This holiday season, across the country, communities are pulling together to provide Christmas gifts for underprivileged children.\n\u201cParents totally get to keep their dignity [with this program],\u201d Woods says.\n\u201cSo [when you donate,] you really are an angel.\u201dTo find out if the Angel Tree program is operating in your community, please visit your local Salvation Army website.\n\u201cFor many children, the gifts they receive through Angel Tree are the only ones they will open on Christmas,\u201d a statement released by the Salvation Army reads.\n\u201cFor many children, the gifts they receive through Angel Tree are the only ones they will open on Christmas.\u201dIt\u2019s a part of the Salvation Army\u2019s annual \u201cAngel Tree program,\u201d which has locations based everywhere from Knoxville to Orlando to Washington, D.C."}
