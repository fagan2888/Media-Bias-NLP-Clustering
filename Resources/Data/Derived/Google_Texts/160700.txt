Harry Reid shames NFL over Deflategate

Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid blasted the National Football League’s priorities Tuesday during opening remarks on the Senate floor, reiterating his disdain for the Washington Redskins’ name.

The Nevada Democrat expressed amazement that the league is more concerned about Deflategate than it is about the name of Washington’s NFL franchise.

“I find it stunning that the National Football League is more concerned about how much air is in a football than with a racist franchise name that denigrates Native Americans across the country,” Reid said.

“The Redskins name is a racist name,” he added, asking Commissioner Roger Goodell to act on changing the team’s name.

On Monday, the NFL suspended New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady for four games after an investigation into the scandal, with a report saying “it was unlikely” that he was not “at least generally aware” of locker room attendants using underinflated footballs to the team’s advantage during January’s AFC Championship Game against the Indianapolis Colts. Brady will appeal the decision. The league also docked the team two draft picks in 2016 and 2017.

“So I wish the commissioner would act as swiftly and decisively in changing the name of the Washington, D.C., team, as he did enforcing how much air is in the football,” Reid said.

Reid has long maintained that the team should change its name, and he predicted last year that it would change its name in the next three years. A group of 50 senators wrote to the NFL last year, urging the league to change the name.
