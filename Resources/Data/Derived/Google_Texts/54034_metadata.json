Congressional Democrats want to allow limited bankruptcy relief, but Republicans say it\u2019s not enough and that leaders need to address the territory\u2019s underlying budget issues.\n\nIronically, a new report in The Washington Post says Congress has actually played a contributing role in the fiscal trouble of the U.S. commonwealth.\n\nJoining us now with the details, from Baltimore, is Michael Fletcher, who has been covering the story.\n\nYou were just down there a few weeks ago. So, what\u2019s the U.S. responsibility in this crises?\n\nMICHAEL FLETCHER, THE WASHINGTON POST: Well, it\u2019s interesting. The political economy has been skewed for years by U.S. taxpayers essentially. In many ways, early on decades ago, that led to a kind of a development of the island as kind of this manufacturing hub, which is a very generous tax break.\n\nThe first ones to clothing and shoe manufactures. Then in 1970s, it kind of shifted to more capital-intensive businesses like pharmaceutical manufacturing. And that made Puerto Rico into one of the top prescription drug manufacturers in the world. At one point, something like 13 of the top 20 prescription drugs are actually made in Puerto Rico.\n\nAnd in many ways, that development took away from other things the island might have done naturally, like develop more, its tourism sector or what have you.\n\nIt was fine as long as the tax break lasted, but then in 1996, Congress did away, it began to phase out that tax break, and ti was fully phase out since 2006. And since then, Puerto Rico\u2019s been in recession.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: And they can\u2019t declare bankruptcy like Detroit can.\n\nMICHAEL FLETCHER: They can\u2019t. They\u2019re treated just like states are under bankruptcy law, like municipalities and hospital districts, things like that.\n\nThey can \u2014 they can declare bankruptcy which gives them breathing room to reorganize their debts, and Puerto Rico cannot do that. For the last nine, 10, 12 years, Puerto Rico has been stuck in the cycle of following more money basically to pay for its ongoing operations.\n\nRight now, close to half of the budget\u2019s goes to debt service and this is just an unsustainable situation. So, now, the island is looking for at least some limited Chapter 9 relief.\n\nThey want to be able to have sort of state-run corporations which on the island provide electricity, they take care of water and sewer and highways, they want the ability for those corporations at least to go to bankruptcy so they could work out something with creditors.\n\nAnd really the threat from Puerto Rico is that if there\u2019s no Chapter 9 relief, there will be bankruptcy by another name. They\u2019ll just default, and creditors will have to sue and this will be a dragged out process that will be no good for creditors and also very bad for the island as well.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: So, there\u2019s also this political tension here. The Democratic candidates, even the White House is behind this Chapter 9 possible legislation that\u2019s working its way through.\n\nBut then, there\u2019s some tension inside the Republican Party on some folks who might be concerned about the votes versus concerned about the hedge fund managers.\n\nMICHAEL FLETCHER: Exactly right. It\u2019s kind of tugged two ways. A lot of the creditors, of course, are saying they don\u2019t want Puerto Rico to have this bankruptcy option because that\u2019s the reason they extended credit.\n\nThey knew that the island couldn\u2019t go into bankruptcy and they assume they\u2019ve offered another layer of protection that the island doesn\u2019t have to go that much farther to pay those debts. So, there\u2019s that.\n\nBut, also, you look at states like Florida, where you have an increasing Puerto Rican population.\n\nThere\u2019s been a flight from Puerto Rico, for all these economic problems, and a lot of people are going to central Florida, others go to New York, of course, or Philadelphia. But that creates this kind of political pressure to do something.\n\nAnd I think both Democrats and Republicans feel that. But many Republicans don\u2019t like the idea of bankruptcy.\n\nSome equated to a bailout, which is interesting. I don\u2019t see quite how that\u2019s a government bailout. But nonetheless they sort of feel the sense that Puerto Rico has to somehow pay this debt.\n\nBut given the way that cycle working, it seems unlikely that they\u2019ll be able to do that, barring some unforeseen economic expansion.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: All right.
