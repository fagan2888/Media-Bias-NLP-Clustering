In addition to Butler\u2019s hunger strike, Missouri students have launched a Change.org petition addressed to Missouri Governor Jay Nixon, demanding that he fire president Wolfe.\n\nThe University of Missouri did not respond to Campus Reform\u2019s request for comment.\n\nFollow the author of this article on Twitter: @peterjhasson", "article_metadata": {"category": "News", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.campusreform.org/img/CROBlog/6945/hungerstrike.jpg", "description": "The Mizzou grad student says his strike will not end until he dies or the school's president, Tim Wolfe, is fired.", "og": {"site_name": "Campus Reform", "description": "The Mizzou grad student says his strike will not end until he dies or the school's president, Tim Wolfe, is fired.", "title": "Student launches hunger strike over cancellation of Planned Parenthood contract", "url": "http://www.campusreform.org/?ID=6945", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.campusreform.org/img/CROBlog/6945/hungerstrike.jpg", "height": 600}, "author": "Peter Hasson", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "image": "http://www.campusreform.org/img/CROBlog/6945/hungerstrike.jpg", "fb": {"admins": 19226500, "app_id": 127484367480}, "keywords": ",University of Missouri, Tim Wolfe, , Peter Hasson", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CampusReform", "published_time": "2015-11-02 17:40:07.0", "description": "The Mizzou grad student says his strike will not end until he dies or the school's president, Tim Wolfe, is fired.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/CampusReform", "section": "News", "modified_time": "2015-11-02 17:46:11.0"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Mizzou grad student says his strike will not end until he dies or the school's president, Tim Wolfe, is fired.", "title": "Student launches hunger strike over cancellation of Planned Parenthood contract", "image": {"src": "http://www.campusreform.org/img/CROBlog/6945/hungerstrike.jpg"}, "creator": "@peterjhasson", "site": "@campusreform", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "In addition to Butler\u2019s hunger strike, Missouri students have launched a Change.org petition addressed to Missouri Governor Jay Nixon, demanding that he fire president Wolfe.\nA graduate student at the University of Missouri has begun a hunger strike that he says will not end until either he dies or university president Tim Wolfe is fired.\n\"I will not consume any food... at the expense of my health until either Tim Wolfe is removed from office or my internal organs fail and my life is lost.\"\nIn the publicly-posted letter, Jonathan Butler blames President Wolfe\u2014whom he referred to as \u201cdecaying flesh\u201d\u2014for \u201ca slew of racist, sexist, homophobic, etc[.]\nThe University of Missouri did not respond to Campus Reform\u2019s request for comment."}
