In an interview with the New York Times’s Ana Marie Cox, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz revealed that he has quite intimate knowledge about the world of comic books characters and science fiction movies.

Perhaps the most insightful nugget from the interview, however, had to be his affinity for Spider-Man.

When Cox asked Cruz if he was attracted to anti-heroes, citing his Obamacare filibuster in which he impersonated Darth Vader, Cruz responded, “I was always a Han Solo guy. And when it comes to comics, I was more of a Spider-Man guy.”

Cruz also talked about his love of “Star Trek,” noting that when choosing between Captain Picard and Captain Kirk he is all about Kirk.

“Let me do a little psychoanalysis,” Cruz said. “If you look at ‘Star Trek: The Next Generation,’ it basically split James T. Kirk into two people. Picard was Kirk’s rational side, and William Riker was his passionate side. I prefer a complete captain. To be effective, you need both heart and mind.”

Perhaps part of the reason he likes Kirk so much has to do with his assessment that “Kirk is quite likely a Republican, and Picard is quite likely a Democrat.”

However, Cruz did spot one big difference between himself and Kirk: “I can affirmatively say that I have made out with far fewer space aliens.”
