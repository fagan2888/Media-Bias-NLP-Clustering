Warm up to woolen quilts

This is the week to seek out warmth, or even the suggestion of warmth. "Sheared Delights" is an exhibit of vintage and contemporary wool quilts and other textiles that's in its final week at the Wisconsin Museum of Quilts & Fiber Arts in Cedarburg.

Gathered for the exhibit are the museum's Jud and Luella Doss vintage wool quilt collection, vintage wool crazy quilts and log cabin quilts and contemporary wool quilts from Judy Zoelzer Levine and Lori Weaver.

Also in the exhibit are designer samples from Wisconsin wool artists and growers as well as hooked, braided, woven and penny rugs, and wearable art — mittens, slippers, booties, stockings, hats, coats and gloves. The gift shop offers items handmade by local artists.

The museum reopens Wednesday, and the exhibit's final day is Jan. 18. Museum hours are 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Wednesday through Saturday, and noon to 4 p.m. Sunday. Admission is $8 for adults, $7 for seniors and $5 for children ages 6 to 17.

It's at N50-W5050 Portland Road (Ozaukee County Highway T), with the entrance off Struck Lane. It's off Columbia Road, to the east of Cedarburg's downtown. For information, call (262) 546-0300.
