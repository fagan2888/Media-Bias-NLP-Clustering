John Kasich told supporters Saturday he\u2019s delivered on many of the Democratic ideals he learned in his blue-collar hometown and his state is setting an example that can end partisan bickering.\n\nKasich was introduced at a pre-Election Day rally by former Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, both of whom joined him at an early morning Republican breakfast.\n\n\u201cThis is not just an election; this is a movement in Ohio,\u201d Kasich told about 400 people who rallied at the Ohio State University Airport, drawing parallels with Christie\u2019s work in New Jersey.\n\nKasich asked backers to tell Democrats among family and friends about his administration\u2019s efforts to right Ohio\u2019s finances, improve education, fight prescription drug abuse and help the poor and mentally ill. He urged supporters to tell Democrats to \u201ccome across the river\u201d to the Republican Party.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re showing that we can tackle the toughest problems, that no one - including our friends in the minority community - will be left out,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you see what\u2019s happening? We\u2019re uniting the state, and by uniting the state we can help unite the country. We\u2019re all longing for it and hungry for it, for our lives and most important the lives of our children.\u201d\n\nKasich\u2019s remarks came as Ohio Democrats are severely weakened by a series of negative revelations and missteps faced by their gubernatorial candidate, Cuyahoga County executive Ed FitzGerald.\n\nWhile FitzGerald continued to campaign across the state Saturday, the former FBI agent headed into Tuesday\u2019s election having lacked the political capital to force a public debate with Kasich or the money to get his message out on TV. That opened up opportunities for crossover voting for Kasich.\n\nAntonio and Jessica Campbell, both 25, headed into Franklin County\u2019s early voting center Saturday in Columbus optimistic about Democrats\u2019 chances. Both said they planned to vote the entire Democratic ticket, top to bottom.\n\nAsked if that included FitzGerald, Antonio Campbell said, \u201cHe\u2019s iffy, and Kasich\u2019s done a pretty good job.\u201d Jessica Campbell added: \u201cWe\u2019ll see when we get in there.\u201d\n\nNot all Ohio Republicans were out of woods. Ohio Supreme Court Justice Judith French appeared with Kasich at Saturday\u2019s rally to urge Republicans to vote their ballots all the way to the bottom. She noted her tough race against Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Judge John O\u2019Donnell, who\u2019s got an Irish surname favorable with voters in judicial races.\n\n\u201cI know some of you don\u2019t like the French, but I know a lot of you here like Judge Judy,\u201d French said.\n\nAlso appearing at the GOP rally were Auditor Dave Yost and Attorney General Mike DeWine. DeWine won a tight race four years ago against Democratic incumbent Richard Cordray and has faced an aggressive campaign push by Cincinnati lawyer David Pepper.\n\nThe former U.S. senator drew cheers from the crowd when he spoke of reducing the backlog of untested rape kits and shortening processing times at the state\u2019s crime lab, the Bureau of Criminal Identification. He was joined on stage by wife Fran and two of his daughters.\n\nAt state Democratic headquarters in Columbus, volunteers for the national Human Rights Campaign were working the phones to promote their endorsement of Pepper as a supporter of gay marriage rights.\n\nPepper and other Democratic candidates had spread out across the state working to energize volunteer canvassers and to get voters to the polls in a year that both sides acknowledge may see very low turnout - for the reason that Republicans are overconfident and Democrats are unenthused.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s too bad because so much is at stake,\u201d said Pepper, a Cincinnati lawyer. \u201cOften, more things are at stake for Ohioans in this (statewide) election than a presidential election, whether it\u2019s my race or other races.\u201d He mentioned education, election laws and responses to the state\u2019s heroin crisis as examples.\n\n\u201cA lot of the everyday things that people really worry about, the people who are on the (Ohio) ballot this November have more to do with, than the people they vote for in Washington in the other elections,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Joined by a pair of influential national Republicans, Ohio Gov.
