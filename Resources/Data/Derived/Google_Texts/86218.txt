If you still have a hearty appetite after your Labor Day picnics, how about a crab tower?

That's what Flinchy's whipped up in the FOX43 Kitchen earlier this morning.

Flinchy's is located in Camp Hill and specializes in steak and seafood and is open seven days a week. Stop by and enjoy fine casual dining, or hit their Train Wreck Deck for some cocktails.
