More than a contrast really, it\u2019s more like a wide ideological chasm. In the first debate between State Representative Pat Murphy (D-Dubuque) and Dubque businessman Rod Blum (R) we saw a classic statism vs. constituionalism comparison.\n\nSome observations from tonight\u2019s debate:\n\nMurphy\u2019s answer to \u201cwhat was your greatest accomplishment in the Iowa House?\u201d is telling. His answer 1. raising the state minimum wage, 2. adding LGBT as a protected class in Iowa\u2019s Civil Rights code, and 3. Voting against giving Iowans a right to vote on the definition of marriage. This stood in stark contrast with Blum\u2019s greatest accomplishment being a job creator.\n\nMurphy \u2013 raise minimum wage at the Federal level\u2026 Blum \u2013 let state\u2019s decide this for themselves. Blum used an example of North Dakota. He said that McDonald\u2019s offers a starting wage of $15.00/hour and Wal-Mart starts at $18.00/hour because North Dakota\u2019s economy is booming. His message you want to help lift people out of poverty, improve the economy.\n\nMurphy said that you would help take people off of entitlements by raising minimum wage. Blum said more people would go on entitlements as a result of jobs lost.\n\nObamacare \u2013 Murphy: tweak the website and the way states are reimbursed, etc. Blum acknowledged that Obamacare won\u2019t be repealed while President Obama is in office so he work to make it \u201cbetter\u201d by removing some of the more harmful aspects of it.\n\nSocial security: Quote to remember from Murphy: \u201cI will not reform Social Security.\u201d His answer was to try to have more people pay into it. Blum offered several items he\u2019d be willing to discuss including raising the age if need be.\n\nEbola: Blum wanted to restrict travel and keep treatment confined to West Africa. Murphy said he was concerned by the 10% cut that the CDC faced in their budget. He made a statement that literally made my jaw drop \u2013 \u201cLess government may actually be a detriment when it comes to public health.\u201d\n\nImmigration: Murphy \u2013 let the children come forth and be refugees\u2026 Blum \u2013 secure the border and then fix the broken system.\n\nClimate change: Murphy believes that it is a man-made problem that needs government intervention. Blum believes the verdict is out on the cause of Climate Change, and what will happen in the long-term. He said we need to try to be environmentally friendly, but not at the expense of jobs.\n\nSocial issues (unless it was during a spot where the live stream was buffering on me) was not discussed. The only exception would be Murphy\u2019s stated accomplishment in the Iowa Legislature.\n\nForeign policy \u2013 both men would likely be reluctant to support boots on the ground in Iraq. Blum stated that President Obama\u2019s foreign policy has caused our allies not to respect us and our enemies to no longer fear us.\n\nThere was a lot of red meat for liberals and conservatives alike. Neither men made a gaffe, certainly liberals will go ballistic over Blum\u2019s answer on climate change, but his skepticism is relatively mainstream and it is not a primary issue in the race. This race is extremely competitive and I doubt this debate will be a game changer for either men. But we certainly had a lot of red meat for conservatives thrown and tofu for liberals.", "article_metadata": {"shareaholic": {"site_name": "Caffeinated Thoughts", "language": "en-US", "url": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/2014/10/rod-blum-pat-murphy-debate-iowa-1st-congressional-district/", "article_author_name": "Shane Vander Hart", "image": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/pat-murphy-rod-blum.png", "site_id": "965f58835b5900850067f65116487024", "article_published_time": "2014-10-09T03:47:02+00:00", "shareable_page": "true", "article_modified_time": "2016-05-26T05:30:14+00:00", "keywords": "iowa 1st congressional district race, pat murphy, rod blum, election central, iowa news & politics", "wp_version": "7.7.1.0"}, "description": "The debate in Iowa's 1st Congressional District between Pat Murphy and Rod Blum provides a great contrast between statism and constitutionalism.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Caffeinated Thoughts", "description": "The debate in Iowa's 1st Congressional District between Pat Murphy and Rod Blum provides a great contrast between statism and constitutionalism.", "title": "Rod Blum and Pat Murphy Provide Ideological Contrast in First Debate | Caffeinated Thoughts", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/pat-murphy-rod-blum.png", "updated_time": "2014-10-08T22:57:27-05:00", "url": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/2014/10/rod-blum-pat-murphy-debate-iowa-1st-congressional-district/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The debate in Iowa's 1st Congressional District between Pat Murphy and Rod Blum provides a great contrast between statism and constitutionalism.", "creator": "@shanevanderhart", "image": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/pat-murphy-rod-blum.png", "title": "Rod Blum and Pat Murphy Provide Ideological Contrast in First Debate | Caffeinated Thoughts", "site": "@CaffThoughts", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 259594777484510}, "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/CaffThoughts", "published_time": "2014-10-08T22:47:02-05:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/shanevanderhart", "section": "Election Central", "modified_time": "2014-10-08T22:57:27-05:00", "tag": "Rod Blum"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7dbc\"", "article_summary": "In the first debate between State Representative Pat Murphy (D-Dubuque) and Dubque businessman Rod Blum (R) we saw a classic statism vs. constituionalism comparison.\nMurphy \u2013 raise minimum wage at the Federal level\u2026 Blum \u2013 let state\u2019s decide this for themselves.\nMurphy said that you would help take people off of entitlements by raising minimum wage.\nClimate change: Murphy believes that it is a man-made problem that needs government intervention.\nHis answer 1. raising the state minimum wage, 2. adding LGBT as a protected class in Iowa\u2019s Civil Rights code, and 3."}
