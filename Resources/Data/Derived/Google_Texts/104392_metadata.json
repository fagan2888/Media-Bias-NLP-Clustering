Sinclair, who has served on the toy company's board since 1996, has been named chairman and interim chief executive.\n\n\"Mattel is an exceptional company with a great future, but the board believes that it is the right time for new leadership to maximize its potential,\" Mr. Sinclair said in a news release.\n\nMr. Sinclair said Mattel would be working over the coming months to revitalize its business and to \"identify the right leadership for Mattel.\"\n\nThe leadership shuffle came as Mattel posted a preliminary profit in its fourth quarter of 44 cents a share. Sales fell 6% to $1.99 billion. Wall Street had expected 88 cents a share in earnings and $2.14 billion in sales, according to FactSet.\n\nMattel has struggled in recent quarters as its Barbie doll has fallen out of style. Sales of the iconic fashion doll fell a staggering 21% in the third quarter, contributing to a 22% drop in profits and an 8% decline in sales for the toy maker.\n\nWrite to Chelsey Dulaney at Chelsey.Dulaney@wsj.com\n\nAccess Investor Kit for Mattel, Inc.\n\nVisit http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=US5770811025\n\nSubscribe to WSJ: http://online.wsj.com?mod=djnwires\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"page.site": "marketwatch", "parsely-section": "MW_Industries", "author": "Chelsey Dulaney", "og": {"url": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/mattel-ceo-resigns-amid-toy-makers-struggles-2015-01-26-94853247", "type": "article", "image": "http://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "site_name": "MarketWatch", "title": "Mattel CEO resigns amid toy maker's struggles"}, "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_mark.svg", "height": 630}, "card": "summary_large_image", "site": {"id": 624413}}, "parsely-title": "Mattel CEO resigns amid toy maker's struggles", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-01-26T09:32:00-05:00", "ob": {"image": "http://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png"}, "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=336693422", "fb": {"app_id": 283204329838}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "parsely-author": "Chelsey Dulaney", "position": 1, "lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "parsely-type": "post", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch"}, "article.section": "Industries", "parsely-link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/mattel-ceo-resigns-amid-toy-makers-struggles-2015-01-26-94853247", "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "article.id": "0F2E84AC-C670-431C-AD4B-74B07ED1BE64"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1e67\"", "article_summary": "Mr. Sinclair said Mattel would be working over the coming months to revitalize its business and to \"identify the right leadership for Mattel.\"\nThe leadership shuffle came as Mattel posted a preliminary profit in its fourth quarter of 44 cents a share.\nChristopher A.
