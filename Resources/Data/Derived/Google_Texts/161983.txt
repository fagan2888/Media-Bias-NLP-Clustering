Rep. Alan Grayson (D-Fla.) blasted his Republican colleagues and the GOP on Friday night while appearing on “Real Time with Bill Maher,” saying the GOP is divided into three groups: corporate shills, religious fanatics and freedom fiends.

Grayson joined host Bill Maher on the HBO show along with MSNBC.com writer Suzy Khimm and FreedomWorks President Matt Kibbe. When the conversation turned to House Republicans and potential areas to cut spending in the federal government, Grayson and Maher decided to cut the already-divisive GOP into three — or four — factions.

“I see it a little differently,” Grayson said. “I think there’s really three Republican parties. There’s the corporate shills, there are the religious fanatics and then there are the freedom fiends — the ones who want to make sure that you have the right to sleep under a bridge.”

And Maher agreed.

“So Jesus freaks, gun nuts, generic-obese suburbanites and let me add the super rich,” the “Real Time” host said. “That’s the Republican Party isn’t it.”

As the House and Senate continue debates over the government shutdown and continuing resolution to fund the government, the GOP finds itself increasingly divided over action to that. Some in the House argued they are taking orders from Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) while others remain steadfast in their quest to defund or delay the Affordable Care Act.
