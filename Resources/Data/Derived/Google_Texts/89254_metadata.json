That it did so just before the anniversary of his death only makes it worse.\n\nIn 2010, Mark-Viverito asked her fellow councilmembers to sign a petition demanding parole for convicted terrorist Oscar Lopez Rivera, a leader of The Armed Forces of National Liberation, or FALN, a Puerto Rican terrorist group.\n\nMind you, Lopez had rejected clemency when it was offered by President Bill Clinton in 1999. Unlike 15 other FALN members, who took the deal, Lopez chose to remain in prison \u2014 in part because he refused to renounce violence.\n\nFrom 1974 to 1983, the FALN waged a merciless, bloody war against the United States, attacking civilians mainly in Chicago and New York. On Jan. 24, 1975, the FALN\u2019s most deadly attack, the infamous lunchtime bombing of Fraunces Tavern, a New York City landmark, killed my father, Frank Connor, 33, and three other innocent men. It was supposed to be the day we would celebrate my brother\u2019s 11th birthday, and my 9th.\n\nAn FALN communique that day took credit for the attack, which it called a blow against \u201creactionary corporate executives.\u201d In fact, my dad was born to immigrants and raised in working-class Washington Heights, not far from Mark-Viverito\u2019s district. But she apparently doesn\u2019t care about these victims from the city she\u2019ll now help lead.\n\nThe FALN continued its reign of terror until the early 1980s, when 11 of its members were arrested, tried and convicted of (among other serious felonies) weapons possession and seditious conspiracy. The entirely appropriate prison terms were to run from 55 to 70 years.\n\nDuring their trials, these defendants rejected US jurisdiction, claiming to be prisoners of war. Several FALN members threatened to kill or maim the judge, Thomas McMillan.\n\nThe group twice conspired to break Lopez out of prison. Plans involved a direct attack on Leavenworth federal prison, the killing of prison guards and the use of plastic explosives, automatic weapons and a helicopter. The FBI foiled the plot \u2014 and Lopez was tried and convicted for his involvement, with 15 years added to his original 55-year sentence.\n\nThis is the felon whose release the new City Council speaker championed.\n\nAgain, Lopez rejected the Clinton-era clemency offer (which was almost certainly made in order to boost Hillary Clinton\u2019s chances in her 2000 run for a New York seat in the US Senate).\n\nThat offer was conditional on renouncing violence and never again associating with other felons, including his terrorist comrades. The other 15 terrorists took the deal and left prison on Sept. 10, 1999, almost two years to the day before our cousin Steve Schlag, my father\u2019s godson, would be murdered in the World Trade Center.\n\nIn her recent push to spring Lopez, Mark-Viverito claimed he wasn\u2019t accused of killing or harming anyone. In fact, he and his fellow FALN members were convicted of willfully and knowingly joining a conspiracy to commit various acts of violence, including 28 Chicago-area bombings that maimed several people.\n\nFurther, all evidence indicates that those convicted in Chicago were part of the same national conspiracy that killed five people in New York, including the Fraunces murders and the New Year\u2019s Eve 1982 attacks on Police Headquarters that left three NYPD detectives permanently injured.\n\nIn any case, Mark-Viverito\u2019s petition was part of a campaign to sway the January 2011 parole hearing for Lopez. I led a small group of FALN victims and family members to the federal prison in Terre Haute, Ind., and faced Lopez at that very hearing. Justice was served, when, due in part to our efforts, Lopez was denied parole.\n\nBut he remains a cause for certain politically powerful activists. It\u2019s clear to me that, like Hillary Clinton before her, Mark-Viverito had her eyes on her political advantage when she pushed for the terrorist\u2019s release, disgracefully betraying and exploiting the lives of those murdered.\n\nLike Lopez himself, Mark-Viverito chose to ignore the terror victims and families; chose to distort history. The difference is that Lopez remains in prison, a convicted terrorist, while Mark-Viverito is the second-most powerful person in our nation\u2019s largest city.\n\nMy father wouldn\u2019t even recognize what his beloved city has become.\n\nJoe Connor works in the financial services industry.
