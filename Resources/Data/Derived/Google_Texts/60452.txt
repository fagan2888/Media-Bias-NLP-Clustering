DALLAS, Jan. 29, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Star WellnessÂ® is expanding into San Antonio and surrounding areas thanks to its newest franchise agreement with former Star Wellness client Chad Hierholzer. The Dallas/Fort Worth-based franchisor and provider of state-of-the-art healthcare screening services today announced that Hierholzer's franchise will serve San Antonio as well as Del Rio, San Marcos, New Braunfels, Kerrville and other cities in the region.
