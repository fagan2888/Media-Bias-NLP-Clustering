Or was he playing wisely conservative? You make the call\u2026\n\nHere\u2019s the situation: The Chargers were leading 17-13 with 2:25 remaining in Tennessee. Philip Rivers and crew faced a third-and-9 at their own 36.\n\nChargers coach Mike McCoy \u2014 who parlayed his job as Broncos offensive coordinator last season into this, his first year as an NFL head coach \u2014 decides to run the ball, essentially giving up the possession. The Chargers run Ryan Mathews off the left end for a four-yard gain. They then punt on fourth-and-5.\n\nSan Diego gets a good punt from Mike Scifres that pins the Titans to their own 6-yard-line. But they still have 2:05 remaining. And, sure enough, Tennessee drives 94 yards over 10 plays and scores the game-winning TD on a Jake Locker 34-yard TD pass to Justin Hunter.\n\nTitans win 20-17.\n\nSo did Mike McCoy wuss out?\n\nHere are some stats:\n\nSince 2000, there have been 1,578 plays in the NFL on third down with four minutes or less remaining and exactly 9 yards to go. Of those plays, 78.8 percent were pass plays and 21.2 percent were runs. And 27.9 percent resulted in a first down.\n\nSo the odds are 2-1 against gaining a first down. But the odds are also slim that you\u2019ll cause a turnover. Only 3.1 percent of plays resulted in an interception. So the chances of a first down are about 10 times great than a turnover.\n\nIn McCoy\u2019s case, the chances of failure with a pass were slim. An incomplete pass or a sack would not significantly punish the Chargers \u2014 they\u2019d just have to punt, same as they did after running for four yards.\n\nIn other words, why not attempt to gain a first down by passing, when the stats say the risk isn\u2019t very severe?\n\nAccording to Advanced NFL Stats, the Chargers on that third down had a very healthy 81 percent chance of winning the game. But after running the ball, it dipped to 74.\n\nIn a semi-related note, the Broncos last season under McCoy and coach John Fox took some heat after calling for Peyton Manning to kneel down at the end of regulation in a loss to Baltimore.\n\nIn that game, Fox appeared to have overestimated the risk in running a play. It might be that Mike McCoy is now overestimating the risk in San Diego.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "advanced NFL stats,Jake Locker,Mike McCoy,Philip Rivers,Ryan Mathews,Tennesse Titans,Tennessee", "language": "en, sv", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "First-and-Orange", "description": "Did Mike McCoy wimp out late in the Chargers' game Sunday against the Titans?
