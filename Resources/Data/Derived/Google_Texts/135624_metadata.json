(Charles Dharapak/AP)\n\nCruz cracked his joke during a half-hour speech at a Livingston County Republican Party dinner in Howell, Mich., with about 650 fellow Republicans packed into a banquet hall, according to the Detroit News.\n\n\u201cVice President Joe Biden,\u201d Cruz, a Texas Senator, told the crowd. \u201cYou know the nice thing? You don\u2019t need a punch line.\u201d (The joke starts at 17:30 in the audio clip.)\n\n\u201cI promise you it works,\u201d he went on, to laughter and applause. \u201cThe next party you\u2019re at, just walk up to someone and say, \u2018Vice President Joe Biden\u2019 and just close your mouth. They will crack up laughing.\u201d\n\nThe joke comes four days after the death of Beau Biden, 46, an Iraq War veteran and former two-term attorney general of Delaware. He is set to be buried in Delaware on Saturday.\n\nWithin an hour of his joke, as social media lit up with outrage, Cruz apologized on his Facebook page.\n\n\u201cIt was a mistake to use an old joke about Joe Biden during his time of grief, and I sincerely apologize,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe loss of his son is heartbreaking and tragic, and our prayers are very much with the Vice President and his family.\u201d\n\nCruz has been repeating the same \u201cold joke\u201d about Biden since at least 2013.\n\nDuring his speech, Cruz also called to \u201crepeal every word of Obamacare\u201d and criticized his Republican challengers for not standing up for Indiana\u2019s controversial religious freedom law, which many said would legalize discrimination against LGBT customers in businesses around the state.\n\nDetroit News reporter Chad Livengood wrote that when he asked Cruz why he used the Biden joke Wednesday night, the presidential candidate walked away without answering.\n\nFollow @jaysunsilver\n\nON A MOBILE DEVICE?
