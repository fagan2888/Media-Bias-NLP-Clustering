They just came to us and asked if we\u2019d endorse the bill.\u201d\n\nGreg Newburn, the Florida director of Families Against Mandatory Minimums (FAMM), corroborated Hammer\u2019s story.\n\n\u201cMarion is correct,\u201d Newburn said via email. \u201cI asked for her help in reforming 10-20-Life, and she\u2019s been tremendously helpful in that effort. But the NRA had nothing to do with writing the original bill.\u201d\n\nFAMM is a nonprofit organization that advocates for state and federal sentencing reform, specifically the repeal of mandatory minimum sentencing guidelines.\n\nFAMM and the NRA, among others, argue that losing a self-defense case in court shouldn\u2019t automatically result in 10 or 20 years in state prison.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re in a self-defense situation and you pull a gun and show it to make a bad guy go away, you should not be arrested under aggravated assault and be subject to 10 years mandatory minimum,\u201d Hammer said. \u201cAnd if you make an unwise shot to warn someone, you certainly shouldn\u2019t be going to jail for 20 years.\u201d\n\nFAMM\u2019s website argues for either repealing the 10-20-Life law or allowing a \u201csafety valve\u201d for judges to deviate from the mandatory minimum if certain conditions are met.\n\n\u201cThough the law\u2019s authors intended it to apply to \u2018the thug who was robbing a liquor store\u2019 10-20-Life is being applied in self-defense cases, particularly aggravated assault cases in which a defendant either displays a firearm or fires a \u2018warning shot\u2019 in self-defense,\u201d FAMM states on its website. \u201c10-20-Life\u2019s severe penalties make the consequences of any mistaken or rejected claim of self-defense extraordinarily high.\u201d\n\nAn appellate court granted a new trial in the case of Marissa Alexander, a black mother of three who was sentenced to 20 years in prison for aggravated assault for allegedly firing a warning shot at her then-husband. Alexander claims her husband had first broken through a door and then charged at her \u201cin a rage\u201d saying, \u201cBitch, I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d\n\nIn May 2012, Gawker was literally outraged over Alexander\u2019s sentence.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "The viral content blog\u00a0Gawker published an article Friday headlined: \u201cThe NRA Literally Wrote Florida\u2019s New Bill to Legalize Warning Shots.\u201d\u00a0However, a brief investigation by the Free Beacon r", "title": "Gawker Got Literally Everything Wrong About Florida\u2019s New Warning Shots Bill", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/issues/gawker-got-literally-everything-wrong-about-floridas-new-warning-shots-bill/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Gawker-150x96.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The viral content blog\u00a0Gawker published an article Friday headlined: \u201cThe NRA Literally Wrote Flo", "creator": "@cjciaramella", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Gawker-150x96.png", "title": "Gawker Got Literally Everything Wrong About Florida\u2019s New Warning Shots Bill", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc2fa\"", "article_summary": "BY: Follow @cjciaramellaThe viral content blog Gawker published an article Friday headlined: \u201cThe NRA Literally Wrote Florida\u2019s New Bill to Legalize Warning Shots.\u201d However, a brief investigation by the Free Beacon revealed that the NRA literally did not write Florida\u2019s new bill to legalize warning shots.\n\u201cIt\u2019s Families Against Mandatory Minimum\u2019s bill, and my understanding is that Greg Newburn and his staff wrote it.\nGawker reporter Adam Weinstein wrote Friday that Marion Hammer, a former NRA president and lobbyist for the Unified Sportsmen of Florida, was responsible for writing and pushing the bill.\nBut the NRA had nothing to do with writing the original bill.\u201dFAMM is a nonprofit organization that advocates for state and federal sentencing reform, specifically the repeal of mandatory minimum sentencing guidelines.\nAlexander claims her husband had first broken through a door and then charged at her \u201cin a rage\u201d saying, \u201cBitch, I\u2019ll kill you.\u201dIn May 2012, Gawker was literally outraged over Alexander\u2019s sentence."}
