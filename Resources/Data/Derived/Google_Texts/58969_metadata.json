That\u2019s a no-no when you are trying to report actual news. (The new release didn\u2019t correct the hospital name. Miami Children\u2019s Hospital was recently renamed in honor of golf legend Jack Nicklaus because the foundation run by Nicklaus and his wife donated $60 million to the hospital.)\n\nBut then we took another look at this photo from Next Galaxy and decided it was too cool not to share. If this is the future of medical education, bring it on!\n\nPhoto: Next Galaxy", "article_metadata": {"description": "Nicklaus Children's Hospital in Miami is adding virtual reality to its educational offerings for both patients and medical professionals.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "MedCity News", "description": "Nicklaus Children's Hospital in Miami is adding virtual reality to its educational offerings for both patients and medical professionals.", "title": "Virtual reality to be part of education at Miami\u2019s Nicklaus Children\u2019s", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Next-Galaxy-Hospital-VR.png", "updated_time": "2015-05-17T23:54:30-04:00", "url": "http://medcitynews.com/2015/05/virtual-reality-to-be-part-of-education-at-miamis-nicklaus-childrens/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Next-Galaxy-Hospital-VR.png", "creator": "@nversel", "description": "Nicklaus Children's Hospital in Miami is adding virtual reality to its educational offerings for both patients and medical professionals.", "card": "summary", "title": "Virtual reality joining Miami's Nicklaus Children's Hospital"}, "fb": {"app_id": 148725768475669}, "google-site-verification": "xudQg7nxVR9ifmMTY4Tf-0wVtX9b6rWLQd0utCweGOc", "keywords": "weight loss, obesity, overweight,diabetes,massachusetts,medical devices,obesity,startups,healthcare innovation, medcity news,medcity news,san francisco, startups, life sciences,accelerator,rock health,startup advice,startup funding,patient monitoring system, motion sensors ,dc,healthcare it,washington,foodborne pathogens, diagnostics company, diagnostic platforms,minimally invasive surgery, laser surgery,cambridge,dealflow,hospitals,wellpoint, healthways, health and wellness, employee wellness programs,investing,wellness,medtronic, shanghai innovation center, china, r&d,china,mdt,minneapolis,minnesota,publics,twin cities,ulcerative colitis, abbott labs, humira,abbott labs,doctors,pharmaceuticals,skin disorders, pharmaceuticals, md anderson cancer center,cancer,texas,renal denervation, st. jude medical,st. jude medical,stj,emr, ehr, electronic health records, electronic medical records, certified emr,certified emr,ehr,electronic health records,electronic medical records,advanced cellular technology,amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,embryonic stem cells,geron corporation,lou gehrig\\'s disease,macular degeneration,regenerative medicine,spinal cord damage,value-based healthcare system, obamacare, fee-for-service model,california,cleveland,health insurance,insurance,ohio,pennsylvania,politics,cancer treatment options library, aetna, aet, healthcare it,aet,aetna,health it,phi,philadelphia,Miami, miami children's hospital, Next Galaxy, Nicklaus Children's Hospital, virtual reality, , MedCity News", "article": {"section": "Convergence", "tag": "virtual reality", "published_time": "2015-05-16T17:47:11-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-17T23:54:30-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,width=device-width,user-scalable=no,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce2a0\"", "article_summary": "Miami Children\u2019s Hospital was recently renamed in honor of golf legend Jack Nicklaus because the foundation run by Nicklaus and his wife donated $60 million to the hospital.)\nThe New York-based virtual-reality company put out a press release this week touting a deal with Nicklaus Children\u2019s Hospital in Miami to build VR educational content for both patient and medical professional education.\nBut then we took another look at this photo from Next Galaxy and decided it was too cool not to share.\nWe were going to write a full story, but then we discovered that this release was a rehash of news announced in March.\n(The new release didn\u2019t correct the hospital name."}
