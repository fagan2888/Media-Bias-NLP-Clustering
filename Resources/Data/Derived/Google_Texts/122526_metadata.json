(Photo: John Locher, AP)\n\nOur federal government has become so overtly oppressive in so many ways that ordinary citizens have decided that enough is enough, and they are prepared (and in some cases anxious) to take a stand somewhere. Anywhere.\n\nThe federal mismanagement of the events at Bundy Ranch has created a difficult and dangerous situation for everyone going forward.\n\nOUR VIEW: Festering dispute invites more trouble\n\nFederal authorities were eager to strap on the body armor, load up the armored vehicles and literally invade a cattle ranch, when the appropriate course of action would have been to place a legal lien on the rancher's cattle or use local law enforcement officers such as the county sheriff.\n\nEven the sheriff recommended against the federal action, but acting with predictable arrogance, an overly aggressive and militarized federal law enforcement action prompted a predictable response from ordinary citizens.\n\nThen a news media frenzy ensued that encouraged more people to come from far and wide to take a stand.\n\nAt the end of it all, federal authorities had to back off, but not before promising that they would return to finish what they started.\n\nWhat a mess.\n\nAnother push by heavily armed federal agents is an invitation to violence, yet we cannot have a situation where citizens decide for themselves which laws they feel like following, or when and if they will recognize their own government as legitimate.\n\nToday, Cliven Bundy is a celebrity who can raise large sums of money to fight for his cause in the courts. That is where this matter needs to return. Once a court reviews Bundy's claims as well as those of the federal government, a decision will be rendered that will need to be enforced.\n\nWhen the time comes for that enforcement, local law enforcement is best suited to handle the task.\n\nWe remain a nation of laws and due process.\n\nBundy deserves to be heard, and in return he has a moral and legal obligation to peaceably abide by the results of a fair and impartial process.\n\nBut this process needs to begin afresh if it is to enjoy the confidence of our nation's citizens.\n\nDavid Livingston is a Republican state representative from Arizona.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1myS6tX", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "This dispute needs to return to the courts, writes David Livingston, a Republican state representative from Arizona.", "og": {"site_name": "USA TODAY", "description": "This dispute needs to return to the courts, writes David Livingston, a Republican state representative from Arizona.", "title": "Federal mess at Bundy Ranch: Opposing view", "url": "http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2014/07/13/cliven-bundy-ranch-cattle-sheriff-blm-editorials-debates/12604287/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "This dispute needs to return to the courts, writes David Livingston, a Republican state representative from Arizona.", "title": "Federal mess at Bundy Ranch: Opposing view", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d5c7383955731c21cf69d18804f933f394c33b55/c=0-0-649-649&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/USATODAY/USATODAY/2014/07/13/1405295498000-OPPOSE.JPG", "creator": "@usatoday", "site": "@usatoday", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "fb": {"app_id": 215046668549694}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Topics/Editorials and Debates", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Topics/Editorials and Debates", "title": "Federal mess at Bundy Ranch: Opposing view", "author": "David Livingston", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7be6eddfbc5613896f0b0a853dd509b0a7dcf499/c=10-0-498-649/local/-/media/USATODAY/USATODAY/2014/07/13/1405295498000-OPPOSE.JPG", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/42827210b66eac343f0a277b648c5b7e8c1e8229/c=0-0-649-649/local/-/media/USATODAY/USATODAY/2014/07/13/1405295498000-OPPOSE.JPG", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/906f4897260dcceb8d2b3a02e53829a75ed44304/c=98-0-963-649/local/-/media/USATODAY/USATODAY/2014/07/13/1405295498000-OPPOSE.JPG", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1e7e22a571a17b25014bf242d008db849e13f0d3/c=0-23-1024-600&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/USATODAY/USATODAY/2014/07/13/1405295498000-OPPOSE.JPG", "publishtime": "2014-07-13T19:55:18.747000-04:00", "shorthed": "Feds create Bundy mess: Opposing view", "articleid": 12604287, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c21e5578ac6820a4d4dc2cb02c0584e2621a3b3b/c=0-23-1024-600/local/-/media/USATODAY/USATODAY/2014/07/13/1405295498000-OPPOSE.JPG", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/753fbab4e138b88c31a01622e781120c87f13b5f/c=51-0-416-649/local/-/media/USATODAY/USATODAY/2014/07/13/1405295498000-OPPOSE.JPG"}}, "news_keywords": "Cliven Bundy, ranch, cattle, sheriff, BLM, editorials, debates,"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe279b\"", "article_summary": "Even the sheriff recommended against the federal action, but acting with predictable arrogance, an overly aggressive and militarized federal law enforcement action prompted a predictable response from ordinary citizens.\nThe federal mismanagement of the events at Bundy Ranch has created a difficult and dangerous situation for everyone going forward.\nWhen the time comes for that enforcement, local law enforcement is best suited to handle the task.\nContractors for the Bureau of Land Management round up cattle belonging to Cliven Bundy with a helicopter near Bunkerville, Nev., in April.\nToday, Cliven Bundy is a celebrity who can raise large sums of money to fight for his cause in the courts."}
