But after the heart attack, the insurance company began increasing her monthly premium. Wyble says at one point, she had to pay almost $500 a month.\n\n\u201cAnd then when we found out they were going to jump even more again the following January,\u201d Wyble said. \u201cIt was very clear to us that we couldn\u2019t pay my premiums anymore and that mine would just have to be dropped. In effect, [the insurance company] decided to get rid of me, and it worked. They did. They got rid of me.\u201d\n\nThat was in late 2004. Since then, Wyble has relied on the Family Health Center for her primary care. She visits her primary care physician up to eight times a year. She needs specialist care. She has bad circulation on her foot, which causes cellulitis. She hasn\u2019t been able to afford a specialist visit in nearly a decade. Her husband Austin gets nervous every time she gets sick, she said. The family could never afford a hospital stay.\n\nWyble has hoped the Affordable Care Act and the online health insurance marketplace could help her afford a new insurance plan. Under the new law, insurance companies aren\u2019t allowed to charge consumers more for having such pre-existing conditions as Wyble\u2019s heart attack. Her family income also makes her eligible for significant subsidies that can help her pay her monthly premiums. All she has to do is enroll at HealthCare.Gov.\n\nBut it hasn\u2019t been easy. Aaron Swaney, the certified application counselor based out of the Family Health Center, first helped Wyble make an account on the marketplace on Nov. 15. By the second of week of December, her account still says \u201cin progress.\u201d\n\nSwaney says most people he helps see their applications say \u201ccompleted\u201d within a day. Then, they can look at the insurance options available on HealthCare.Gov and find out exactly how much financial help they\u2019re eligible for. Wyble hasn\u2019t been able to do that, mere weeks before the enrollment deadline. The last day to purchase in an insurance plan offered on HealthCare.gov is Dec. 23.\n\nSwaney thinks the problem might be the additional Social Security income Wyble gets from being the appointed caretaker of her granddaughter, Emma.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always had weird things with children that get Social Security, that\u2019s always, It creates a weird situation,\u201d Swaney said.\n\nOn the heel of the website\u2019s rollout glitches, it\u2019s not entirely clear to Swaney how a child\u2019s Social Security income would make Wyble\u2019s application stuck in limbo. And there\u2019s no guidebook on how to get it unstuck. So Swaney tries different troubleshooting techniques. Throughout multiple meetings with Wyble, Swaney has re-entered her income information in different ways. In this particular meeting, more than once, the server crashes and kicks him off HealthCare.gov.\n\n\u201cHave you had this much problem with anybody else\u2019s?\u201d Wyble wondered aloud.\n\nSwaney thought about it for a second. He\u2019s had similar problems with a handful other people, he said.\n\nWyble laughed. \u201cOh good. I was beginning to think it doesn\u2019t like me or something.\u201d\n\nCalling the 1-800 HealthCare.gov help center isn\u2019t much help. When Wyble\u2019s application continued to say \u201cin progress\u201d after two weeks, she called the number for help, but the woman on the other side of the line didn\u2019t help much.\n\n\u201cShe was muddling through it and what she was saying didn\u2019t make sense,\u201d Wyble said. \u201cShe didn\u2019t understand it either.\u201d\n\nWhen Swaney and Wyble called on Dec. 5, they waited for an available representative for about 10 minutes. When they finally got through, they were told to just wait more until the application fixes itself. But Swaney decided to cancel Wyble\u2019s first marketplace account and start completely fresh. They made another appointment to see each other the next day, hoping the sixth time would be the charm.\n\nJeremy Milarsky, who, like Swaney, has been certified to help consumers enroll on HealthCare.gov, sums up the situation:\n\n\u201cThis is a system that lends itself very well to people who are organized and follow up. That\u2019s another thing that we can help people with. If you\u2019re the kind of person who just sits back and expect everything to fall into place, you\u2019re more likely to run into problems.\u201d\n\nFor Wyble and Swaney, persistence was about to pay off. After six appointments and what seems like Swaney\u2019s thousandth time pressing the \u201csubmit\u201d button, Wyble gets the good news.\n\n\u201cOh my status says \u2018complete,\u2019\u201d Wyble said, peering over Swaney\u2019s shoulder to his computer on Dec. 11. \u201cAlright! Having fun now. Really didn\u2019t think it was going to say anything but \u2018in progress.\u2019\u201d\n\nNow, Swaney is able to show Wyble the plans available to her and figure out what\u2019s best for the kind of care she needs. As a federally certified and state licensed navigator, Swaney\u2019s job isn\u2019t to suggest a specific plan for Wyble to purchase.\n\n\u201cSince you use care a lot, I\u2019m going to focus on the silver plans,\u201d Swaney said. \u201cBronze plans are going to have a high deductible and gold plans are too expensive.\u201d\n\nThe plans on the website are divided into different levels based on their actuarial value: bronze, silver, gold and platinum. Actuarial value measures the \u201ctrue\u201d value of a plan. Bronze plans, for example, have an actuarial value of 60 percent. That means on average, people who purchase bronze plans would be responsible for 40 percent of the plan's covered benefits, and the insurance companies would cover 60 percent of the cost. Silver plans have a 70 percent actuarial value, gold plans 80, and platinum plans 90. The lower the actuarial value, the cheaper the plan's monthly premium.\n\nIn the end, Wyble chose a silver Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield plan with a $1,150 deductible and a $1,150 out-of-pocket maximum. Wyble will pay about $160 a month for the coverage. Without the Affordable Care Act subsidies, she\u2019d have to pay about $600 a month.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t possibly pay that. I couldn\u2019t pay half of that.\u201d\n\nShe couldn\u2019t stop thanking Swaney for his help.\n\n\u201cYou may be making the difference between me still living in my house, six to eight years from now, you know, still having my house,\u201d she told him. \u201cReally. It\u2019s that big of a deal.\u201d\n\nBut the enrollment work doesn\u2019t stop there. Swaney says he\u2019s been hearing from other consumers that Anthem has a backlog of new accounts it still hasn\u2019t been able to process yet. Wyble may have to be persistent, again, in calling Anthem and making sure she\u2019s in their system.\n\nGood thing Wyble\u2019s excellent at follow-ups.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health and Wealth", "description": "On an afternoon in early December, 60-year-old Columbia resident Jeannie Wyble sits in a small cubicle at Columbia\u2019s Family Health Center, telling Aaron", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "Health & Wealth Desk", "og": {"url": "http://kbia.org/post/success-healthcaregov-takes-patience-persistence", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/kbia/files/styles/medium/public/201312/Wyble1.JPG", "type": "article", "description": "On an afternoon in early December, 60-year-old Columbia resident Jeannie Wyble sits in a small cubicle at Columbia\u2019s Family Health Center, telling Aaron", "title": "Success with HealthCare.gov takes patience, persistence"}, "story_id": 255738810, "twitter": {"site": "@KBIA", "card": "summary", "creator": "@harumendhah"}, "author": "Harum Helmy", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Success with HealthCare.gov takes patience, persistence"}, "nid": 45567, "datePublished": "2013-12-20", "keywords": "affordable care act, navigators, healthcare.gov, health insurance marketplace", "wordCount": 1319, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0343\"", "article_summary": "The last day to purchase in an insurance plan offered on HealthCare.gov is Dec. 23.\nThroughout multiple meetings with Wyble, Swaney has re-entered her income information in different ways.\nWyble has hoped the Affordable Care Act and the online health insurance marketplace could help her afford a new insurance plan.\n\u201cSince you use care a lot, I\u2019m going to focus on the silver plans,\u201d Swaney said.\nI was beginning to think it doesn\u2019t like me or something.\u201dCalling the 1-800 HealthCare.gov help center isn\u2019t much help."}
