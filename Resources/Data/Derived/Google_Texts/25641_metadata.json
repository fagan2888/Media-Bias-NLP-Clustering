Tovino argues that people diagnosed with gambling disorder \u2014 the clinical name for gambling addiction \u2014 should be treated the same as those suffering problems with drinking or drugs.\n\n\u201cIf you see someone with severe gambling disorder, that\u2019s all they focus on,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s as serious a drug addiction as alcoholism.\u201d\n\nUntil last year, the American Psychiatric Association listed gambling disorder as an \u201cimpulse control disorder\u201d in its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. The condition was grouped with kleptomania and pyromania.\n\nIn a 2013 update, the association reclassified gambling disorder as a \u201cnon-substance-related disorder,\u201d under the same umbrella as alcoholism, in a section on addictive diseases. It was a significant shift, and it reflected a growing consensus in medical research.\n\n\u201cAddiction is a disorder of the brain reward system, and it doesn\u2019t matter whether the system is repeatedly activated by gambling or alcohol or another substance,\u201d Tovino said, quoting Dr. Charles O\u2019Brien, who chaired the work group on substance-related disorders for the 2013 update.\n\nBut health and disability laws still have a lot of catching up to do.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act was intended in part to bolster insurance coverage for mental health problems. It requires certain health plans to provide \u201cessential health benefits,\u201d including services for mental health and substance use disorders. But not all of those plans have to cover gambling disorder treatment.\n\nTovino found that Nevada\u2019s requirements for the basic benefits some insurance plans must cover excludes impulse control disorders, including gambling disorder, because the rules were set before the new diagnostic manual was published.\n\nThat means some Nevada residents have health insurance coverage for gambling disorder only if their insurers voluntarily choose to provide it.\n\nThe National Council on Problem Gambling identified similar issues with the law, saying states could sidestep the spirit of the benefits requirement.\n\n\u201cThis process \u2026 appears to allow new plans to avoid coverage for gambling disorder, not because of the legitimacy (of) the condition or because the law intended to exclude gambling disorder, but simply because the practical implementation relies on previously existing plans,\u201d the council wrote.\n\nGambling addicts who try to get disability insurance coverage based on their disorder also face legal roadblocks. Although help for gambling disorder is not excluded in disability law, Tovino found multiple court cases in which people tried and failed to get such coverage.\n\nNevadans aren\u2019t universally barred from getting health insurance coverage for gambling disorder under the ACA, but it\u2019s unclear how many Nevada plans offer it.\n\nJake Sunderland, a spokesman for the Nevada Division of Insurance, said there are two plans on the individual and small-group markets that specifically exclude problem gambling. The rest are unclear.\n\n\u201cFor a majority of the carriers out there, it\u2019s really up to the patient to work with their physician and their insurance carrier to identify what\u2019s medically necessary and what will be covered,\u201d Sunderland said.\n\nThat has proven to be a difficult process for some. Carol O\u2019Hare, executive director of the Nevada Council on Problem Gambling, said her organization has heard from treatment providers that getting an insurance company to cover services is the exception rather than the rule.\n\n\u201cGetting insurance coverage for problem gambling has been historically difficult and at times not cost-effective,\u201d O\u2019Hare said. \u201cIt\u2019s so rare that the insurance will cover it, it\u2019s almost a waste of time.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Hare said insurance companies\u2019 reluctance to cover gambling addiction may stem from a lack of understanding about the disorder, since it doesn\u2019t have the same amount of research amassed over decades that substance abuse has had.\n\nNevada allocates some public money to fund gambling addiction services, so residents are able to get treatment at an affordable price or for free.\n\nBut widespread insurance coverage of gambling addiction still would help. O\u2019Hare said about 60 percent of the public funding typically is allocated for treatment. If more insurers covered treatment, more of that money could be used to improve other services, such as training new counselors.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, if there aren\u2019t more resources somehow to fund the services, the services will not grow,\u201d O\u2019Hare said. \u201cWe are not even scratching the surface of being able to really provide the availability of treatment we should provide.\u201d\n\nPatients at the Problem Gambling Center in Las Vegas, for example, can get their treatments covered for free. But the center\u2019s Dr. Robert Hunter said getting insurance companies on board would be beneficial because it would encourage more people to seek treatment. That\u2019s what happened when insurance companies were compelled to pay for alcoholics\u2019 treatment, Hunter said.\n\n\u201cThat was when people really started coming forward and getting help,\u201d Hunter said. \u201cI think the same thing would happen.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Many insurance policies don\u2019t cover the disorder, even though it has been reclassified under the same umbrella as alcoholism.", "og": {"site_name": "LasVegasSun.com", "description": "Many insurance policies don\u2019t cover the disorder, even though it has been reclassified under the same umbrella as alcoholism.", "title": "Gambling: The neglected addiction", "url": "//lasvegassun.com/news/2014/dec/21/gambling-neglected-addiction/", "image": "http://asset.lasvegassun.com/media/assets/images/icons/sun-app-large.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@LasVegasSun", "image": "//media.lasvegassun.com/media/img/staff/2014/2014_JD_Morris_322_t120.jpg?74788340517f3aca400342a7031f857fc2b12fbe", "account_id": 12055942, "card": "summary", "creator": "@thejdmorris"}, "fb": {"app_id": 112951308742607}, "vr": {"type": "text"}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-21T02:00", "author": "//lasvegassun.com/staff/jd-morris/"}, "verify-v1": "ABQIAAAA8L3JFDSZBbRKiOI0oC2hURQtzf2N5nUcl5FoJ4HJzSUUnGQdoBRCXoBzqBg3VizzahR0b1gDldhrew", "y_key": "33c272341f5beade", "news_keywords": "The Sunday"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd8f3\"", "article_summary": "Tovino argues that people diagnosed with gambling disorder \u2014 the clinical name for gambling addiction \u2014 should be treated the same as those suffering problems with drinking or drugs.\nGambling: The neglected addictionDespite growing consensus that gambling addiction can be as devastating as alcoholism or drug dependency, problem gamblers can face an unfair fight against the disease.\n\u201cThat\u2019s as serious a drug addiction as alcoholism.\u201dUntil last year, the American Psychiatric Association listed gambling disorder as an \u201cimpulse control disorder\u201d in its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.\nThat means some Nevada residents have health insurance coverage for gambling disorder only if their insurers voluntarily choose to provide it.\nIn a 2013 update, the association reclassified gambling disorder as a \u201cnon-substance-related disorder,\u201d under the same umbrella as alcoholism, in a section on addictive diseases."}
