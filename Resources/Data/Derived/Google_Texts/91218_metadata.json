Payne, Jr. ascended to his position in what he termed the \u201cworst way possible.\u201d In 2012, he was serving as the president of the Newark city council when his father passed away after a battle with colon cancer. Now, the younger Payne says his father\u2019s death has inspired him to get healthy and bring health to the people he serves.\n\nPolitickerNJ sat down with Congressman Payne to discuss that renewed focus on health, the legacy of President Barack Obama and the future of the Newark, the state of New Jersey and the U.S. as a whole.\n\n\u201cI have not necessarily been the picture of health myself,\u201d said Payne who struggles with both diabetes and high blood pressure. \u201cI had a foot infection in February that was operated on and cleaned out but, because of my diabetes and my non-compliance over 20 years, to this day the foot is not healed.\u201d\n\nCombined with his father\u2019s struggles\u2014which inspired Payne to push Obama to declare March National Colorectal Health Month\u2014his own struggles with health have made Payne\u2019s focus on healthcare all the more real.\n\n\u201cThe doctors told me they were going to do everything they could to save my foot,\u201d said Payne who now wears a medical boot on his right leg due to the still-healing infection. \u201cI am very fortunate because I have very high-quality health care. But what about the person that shows up at a hospital without health care, without insurance? The doctor rather than saying, \u2018Sir, we are going to do everything we can so save your foot\u2019 will say \u2018Well, that foot has to come off.\u2019 So I fight.\u201d\n\nFor Payne, that fight comes in the form of his ardent support of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare).\n\n\u201cThere is nothing special about me that everyone shouldn\u2019t be treated the same way and that is what I fight for,\u201d Payne said. \u201cPeople have been trying to get universal health care in this country for 50 years. Barack Obama did it.\u201d\n\nCongressman Payne believes that President Obama\u2019s step to make healthcare universal to all Americans is just one of the reasons that the sitting president will go down in history as one of the \u201ctop ten presidents this country has ever known.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook at what he has accomplished with people being against him every step of the way,\u201d said Payne referring to a Congress he feels has been unreasonably resistant to the Democratic president\u2019s policies. \u201cWhat is it about this president that this Congress just refuses to do anything? Nothing of any substance is moving through the House.\u201d\n\nPayne has also been supportive of Obama\u2019s much-contested Iran Nuclear Deal.\n\n\u201cDiplomacy is always better than war,\u201d Payne said. \u201cPeople bring up the notion that we can\u2019t trust Iran. Do we trust China? Do we trust Russia?\u201d\n\nFor Payne, it is past instances like this that demonstrate a \u201cwinning strategy.\u201d\n\nPayne said, \u201cIn those other two instances, when President Nixon went to China and opened relationships with them in the 70s, things got better. When President Reagan negotiated with Gorbachev, it made things better. So why change a winning strategy that has worked with other enemies of this country?\u201d\n\nLooking to the end of Obama\u2019s presidential tenure, Payne Jr. has announced he will be supporting former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton as she seeks the Presidency. Though Vice President Joe Biden\u2014to whom Payne is close\u2014has been rumored to be potentially entering the race, Payne said he does not believe that time should be wasted on \u201chypotheticals\u201d and has, instead, decided to focus all attention on Clinton.\n\n\u201cI have a very close relationship with the Clintons,\u201d Payne told PolitickerNJ. \u201cVice President Biden has always been a great friend and mentor to me and, on the occasions I have had to speak with him, he has been very supportive. It would make it tough [if he entered the race] but he is not in the race, Secretary Clinton is.\u201d\n\nAccording to Payne, Clinton is the right person to address an issue he feels is one of the most critical the U.S. is currently facing: race relations.\n\n\u201cI think that Black Lives Matter has crystallized the issue and brought it to the forefront. People cannot side step it anymore, it is in your face and demanding some type of response,\u201d Payne said. \u201cI think it was very gracious and astute of the Secretary to take time out and sit with the members of Black Lives Matter.\u201d\n\nWhile fellow New Jerseyan and former Mayor of Payne\u2019s home town of Newark, U.S. Senator Cory Booker is rumored to be a potential running mate for Clinton if she gets the nomination, Payne said it is \u201ctoo early\u201d to have an opinion on Booker\u2019s viability for the position. Though Payne said he understands why Booker would be \u201cin the mix.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a political realism, though, that two Northeasterners may not make the best ticket,\u201d said Payne, agreeing with remarks Rep. Bill Pascrell (D-9) made last month.\n\nAnd Payne knows Booker well. Before he was elected to the Senate in 2013, Booker served as Mayor in Newark from 2006 to 2013. Now, his position has been filled by Ras Baraka, a mayor who Payne initially did not support as he sought the election.\n\n\u201cOnce the election is over the people decide who they want as their leader it is incumbent upon us to step up and work with the people that our constituents have chosen as their leaders,\u201d Payne said.\n\nAccording to Payne, he and Baraka have been working together, citing a mutual desire reform Newark\u2019s education program to bring local control back to parents and local officials.\n\nFor Payne, the future looks bright. Though he said he has \u201cno interest\u201d in seeking the soon-to-be-open gubernatorial position, Payne believes he has been \u201cvery fortunate\u201d during his time as a Congressman.\n\nNext? Payne hopes to continue his father\u2019s legacy, focus on constituent services and be the \u201cbest congressperson\u201d he can be.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "https://nyopolitickernj.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/dscn0678-e1439578383217.jpg?w=50", "description": "Congressman Payne discusses a renewed focus on health, President Obama and the future of the Newark, New Jersey and the U.S. as a whole.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "New Jersey News, Politics, Opinion, and Analysis", "description": "PolitickerNJ sat down with Congressman Payne to discuss that renewed focus on health, the legacy of President Barack Obama and the future of the Newark, the state of New Jersey and the U.S. as a wh\u2026", "title": "Congressman Payne Jr. Reflects on Health, the President and the Future", "url": "http://politickernj.com/2015/08/congressman-payne-jr-reflects-on-health-the-president-and-the-future/", "image": {"width": 635, "identifier": "https://nyopolitickernj.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/dscn0678-e1439578383217.jpg", "height": 476}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://nyopolitickernj.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/dscn0678-e1439578383217.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@PolitickerNJ", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@PolitickerNJ"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-08-14 14:59:51", "sailthru.title": "Congressman Payne Jr. Reflects on Health, the President and the Future", "sailthru.tags": "Barack Obama, Congress, Donald Payne Jr., U.S. Senate", "fb": {"app_id": 710865528969413}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://politickernj.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico", "application-name": "New Jersey News, Politics, Opinion, and Analysis", "keywords": "donald payne jr., barack obama, u.s. senate, congress", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PolitickerNJ", "published_time": "2015-08-14T18:59:51+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-14T18:59:51+00:00", "author": "http://wordpress.com/author/alyana-alfaro"}, "sailthru.description": "PolitickerNJ sat down with Congressman Payne to discuss that renewed focus on health, the legacy of President Barack Obama and the future of the Newark, the state of New Jersey and the U.S. as a whole.", "sailthru.image.full": "https://nyopolitickernj.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/dscn0678-e1439578383217.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0", "news_keywords": "Donald Payne Jr., Barack Obama, U.S. Senate, Congress"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd89f6\"", "article_summary": "Though he said he has \u201cno interest\u201d in seeking the soon-to-be-open gubernatorial position, Payne believes he has been \u201cvery fortunate\u201d during his time as a Congressman.\n\u201cI have not necessarily been the picture of health myself,\u201d said Payne who struggles with both diabetes and high blood pressure.\nPolitickerNJ sat down with Congressman Payne to discuss that renewed focus on health, the legacy of President Barack Obama and the future of the Newark, the state of New Jersey and the U.S. as a whole.\nNow, the younger Payne says his father\u2019s death has inspired him to get healthy and bring health to the people he serves.\nPayne hopes to continue his father\u2019s legacy, focus on constituent services and be the \u201cbest congressperson\u201d he can be."}
