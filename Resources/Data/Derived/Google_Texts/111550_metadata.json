In Hawaii, the site was not available to customers until mid-October, and users continue to report problems. Maryland\u2019s exchange portal has had so many issues, including slowness and frequent error messages, that the exchange board decided last week to let insurers handle payments directly for now. It also delayed opening its small business marketplace until April.\n\n\u201cThe complexity of the challenge has been clearly more than we anticipated,\u201d said Dr. Joshua M. Sharfstein, Maryland\u2019s health and mental hygiene secretary and the chairman of the state\u2019s exchange board. \u201cWe are really looking for significant improvement.\u201d\n\nIn Colorado and the District of Columbia, exchange officials say they just repaired major problems. Until last week, Colorado residents who wanted to see if they qualified for a federal subsidy to buy insurance through the state\u2019s exchange had to go through a call center. Many customers have also complained that the application process is cumbersome, requiring them to apply for Medicaid and wait for a denial before finding out if they qualified for a subsidy.\n\nDespite some of their own problems, several of the state-run exchanges, including those in Connecticut, New York and Washington State, are functioning much better than the federal exchange, with customers able to log in, register and enroll much faster than on HealthCare.gov.\n\nNew York, for instance, added server capacity after experiencing problems the first week and has remained largely free of trouble, with insurers saying they are working closely with officials to handle issues as they arise. About 47,000 people have enrolled, including about 24,000 who have selected a private insurance plan.\n\n\u201cThe website is working reasonably well,\u201d said Lynne Scalzo, an executive at Excellus Blue Cross Blue Shield in Rochester, N.Y.\n\nStill, enrollment numbers are lower six weeks after the opening of the online marketplaces than many analysts had projected, according to information collected by the Advisory Board Company and The New York Times.\n\nWhile not every state has made its numbers public yet, including California, which is expected to announce enrollment numbers in the tens of thousands later this week, 10 states and the District of Columbia have provided preliminary estimates. All told, about 210,000 people have signed up, about 155,000 for Medicaid and 55,000 others for private insurance plans. Those numbers include people who have picked a plan but have not necessarily paid their first premium, which is not due for another month.\n\nIn addition, Oregon has signed up more than 70,000 people for the Medicaid expansion through a \u201cfast-track\u201d program that does not rely on the exchange. And Maryland will automatically enroll more than 80,000 newly eligible people in Medicaid in January.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s coming along,\u201d Patty Fontneau, chief executive of Colorado\u2019s exchange, said of her state\u2019s enrollment numbers for private plans, which stood at about 3,400 people as of Nov. 1. \u201cWould I want there to be more? Sure.\u201d\n\nBut exchange officials and others emphasized there was a long way to go before much meaning could be read from enrollment numbers. \u201cWe are not even in the first inning of a nine-inning game,\u201d said Kevin Counihan, chief executive of Connecticut\u2019s exchange, Access Health CT. \u201cFor people to throw out all kinds of inferences on success or failure at this point, I think, is really, really na\u00efve.\u201d\n\nEven states whose websites are working well say they are hampered by a common problem: the federal website, particularly the data hub that checks every applicant\u2019s identity and eligibility. That hub has stopped working on several occasions, preventing applications in the states from being completed.\n\nAfter two such breakdowns recently, officials with Connecticut\u2019s exchange, which has worked relatively smoothly, said they would hire an outside contractor to verify identities when the hub fails.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just trying to make this as easy for the customer as possible,\u201d Mr. Counihan said.\n\nOther state exchanges that work relatively well also have problems. In California, for instance, the exchange website has yet to offer a complete directory of doctors and hospitals in each new plan network. And some users are still complaining about problems and error messages.\n\nState officials also say many residents have been confused by constant news about the dysfunctional federal exchange, wrongly assuming that state exchanges have also failed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very hard for the public to differentiate what they\u2019re seeing in the paper about Obamacare not working \u2014 to realize that\u2019s not our website,\u201d said Richard Sorian, a spokesman for the District of Columbia\u2019s exchange, DC Health Link.\n\nExchange officials, policy analysts and insurance executives caution against reading too much into the enrollment numbers, saying the rocky start of both the federal and many of the state websites has discouraged many individuals from even trying to sign up.\n\n\u201cThe numbers are definitely low,\u201d said Andrew D. Hyman, an official at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, which is closely tracking the rollout of the marketplaces, \u201cbut I think things will turn around quickly once the process is more reliable.\u201d\n\nBut the uneven rollout, even among those states that run their own exchanges, underscores the challenge of creating a new way to buy insurance, one that primarily relies on a website where people can compare plans.\n\n\u201cThe states that had good leadership, good design philosophy and were pragmatic about planning and development of their exchange ultimately are faring the best,\u201d said Dan Schuyler, a director at Leavitt Partners, which worked with several states on developing exchanges.\n\nInsurers, exchange officials and policy analysts all warn that the experience in the first month or so of the program provides little, if any, indication of whether the new marketplaces are succeeding. \u201cThis is all new,\u201d said Michael Wise, the president of ConnecticCare, one of the three insurers offering plans on the state-based exchange. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to know what we should have expected.\u201d\n\nSome insurers say the confusion over some of the websites, along with the political noise, may be dissuading some people from trying to enroll, even in states where the marketplaces are functioning well. Some, like WellPoint, whose Anthem Blue Cross plans are being sold in marketplaces in more than a dozen states, including California and Connecticut, said they were trying to time their sales efforts for when they think there could be the most response. The company has indicated it plans to spend tens of millions of dollars on marketing its plans.\n\n\u201cWe will be calibrating our marketing execution and messaging with the pace of the overall exchange readiness \u2014 and tenor of consumer sentiment,\u201d said Patrick Blair, WellPoint\u2019s chief marketing officer, in a statement.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20131112224611, "twitter": {"description": "Six weeks into the rollout of the health care law, some of the online insurance exchanges run by states are confronting serious issues that mirror those of the larger federal exchange.", "title": "Some State Insurance Exchanges Continue to Battle Technical Problems", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/13/us/some-state-insurance-exchanges-continue-to-battle-technical-problems.html?pagewanted=all", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2013/11/13/us/STATES/STATES-thumbLarge.jpg", "site": "@nytimes", "card": "summary"}, "xlarge": "images/2013/11/13/us/STATES/STATES-articleLarge.jpg", "thumbnail_width": 75, "hdl_p": "Some State Insurance Exchanges Continue to Battle Technical Problems", "sectionfront_jsonp": "http://json8.nytimes.com/pages/national/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "November 12, 2013", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Health Insurance and Managed Care,States (US),Computers and the Internet,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Medicaid,HealthCare.gov", "xlarge_height": 420, "news_keywords": "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act,Medicaid", "PT": "Article", "author": "ABBY GOODNOUGH;REED ABELSON", "thumbnail_150": "http://www.nytimes.com/images/2013/11/13/us/STATES/STATES-thumbLarge.jpg", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "xlarge_width": 600, "byl": "By ABBY GOODNOUGH and REED ABELSON", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "dsk": "U.S.", "lp": "Six weeks into the rollout of the health care law, some of the online insurance exchanges run by states are confronting serious issues that mirror those of the larger federal exchange.", "tom": "News", "thumbnail": "http://www.nytimes.com/images/2013/11/13/us/STATES/STATES-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "Six weeks into the rollout of the health care law, some of the online insurance exchanges run by states are confronting serious issues that mirror those of the larger federal exchange.", "ARTICLE_TEMPLATE_VERSION": 700, "CG": "us", "ROBOTS": "NOARCHIVE", "dat": "November 12, 2013", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "hdr_img": "/images/article/header/sect_us.gif", "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com/", "org": "HealthCare.gov", "thumbnail_height": 75, "ticker": "Advisory Board Co|ABCO|NASDAQ;WellPoint Inc|WLP|NYSE", "slug": "13states", "utime": 20131113122919, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/13/us/some-state-insurance-exchanges-continue-to-battle-technical-problems.html?pagewanted=all", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2013/11/13/us/STATES/STATES-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Six weeks into the rollout of the health care law, some of the online insurance exchanges run by states are confronting serious issues that mirror those of the larger federal exchange.", "title": "Some State Insurance Exchanges Continue to Battle Technical Problems"}, "pdate": 20131112, "des": "Health Insurance and Managed Care;States (US);Computers and the Internet;Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010);Medicaid", "articleid": 100000002545831, "cre": "The New York Times", "emailThisHash": "c6fxLUsZ4Z7jQoEVSO1JFw", "hdl": "Some State Insurance Exchanges Continue to Battle Technical Problems", "PST": "News"}, "article_summary": "All told, about 210,000 people have signed up, about 155,000 for Medicaid and 55,000 others for private insurance plans.\nState officials also say many residents have been confused by constant news about the dysfunctional federal exchange, wrongly assuming that state exchanges have also failed.\n\u201cWe are really looking for significant improvement.\u201dIn Colorado and the District of Columbia, exchange officials say they just repaired major problems.\nIn California, for instance, the exchange website has yet to offer a complete directory of doctors and hospitals in each new plan network.\n\u201cThe complexity of the challenge has been clearly more than we anticipated,\u201d said Dr. Joshua M.
