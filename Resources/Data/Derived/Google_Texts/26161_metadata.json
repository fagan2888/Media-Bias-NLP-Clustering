I\u2019d be more inclined to suggest something more exciting and exotic \u2014 like Facebook\u2019s News Feed algorithm becoming so complex that it ushered in the Singularity, or a Pentagon virus designed to destroy Iraq\u2019s nuclear reactors disastrously merging with Russian malware.\n\nBut the more mundane path forward is always the more likely. Foxconn, the Taiwanese manufacturer of electronic goods famous for its town-size assembly plants, suicidal workers and Apple supply line prowess has made it clear for years that it wants to upgrade from humans to robots. Google has recently been making a big push in both artificial intelligence and robotics. Together, the two companies are perfectly positioned to push the state-of-the-art. Amazing things are bound to happen.\n\nOr seriously troubling things. The big question about Foxconn and Google isn\u2019t actually whether Skynet is around the corner, but what impact further robotics advances will have on the labor market. Humans, apparently, are a pain in the ass for Foxconn.\n\nThe cooperation comes as Foxconn has been striving to accelerate automation efforts at its factories amid challenges of rising labor costs and workplace disputes in China, where it has more than a million workers\u2026. \u201cFoxconn needs Google\u2019s help to step up automation at its factories as the company has the lowest sales per employee among the contract makers, given its large workforce,\u201d said Wanli Wang, an analyst at CIMB Securities. \u201cUsing robots to replace human workers would be the next big thing in the technology industry\u2026\u201d\n\nAs has been noted here many times before, a growing number of economists are worrying that increasing automation is no longer guaranteed to float everyone\u2019s boat, and may actually be contributing directly to rising income inequality. It\u2019s hard to think of a better real-world test of this thesis than an experiment involving one of the world\u2019s biggest manufacturers and one of the world\u2019s cleverest software companies.
