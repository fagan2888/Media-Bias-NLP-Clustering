KEY WEST (CBSMiami/AP) — A 2-day conference is shinning a light on national healthcare and the legacy of President Harry S. Truman.

American Medical Association president Dr. Robert Wah opened the two-day Truman Legacy Symposium Friday night exploring the history of American health care reform, from President Theodore Roosevelt and Truman’s early initiatives to President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act.

He noted Truman’s vision in promoting national health care in 1946 — a failed initiative many believe spurred subsequent programs including Medicare and “Obamacare.”

Events are centered at the Harry S. Truman Little White House where Truman spent 11 working vacations during his 1945-1953 presidency.

The symposium concludes Saturday with speakers including Truman’s grandson, Clifton Truman Daniel.

Florida’s only presidential museum, the Little White House has hosted four former presidents and current presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.
