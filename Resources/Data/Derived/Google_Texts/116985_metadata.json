It was the offensive play of the game until, you know, they blew the game. But on Monday night at Cincinnati, the Broncos receiver hauled in a ball with just his right arm, while the cornerback committed pass interference. It was stupendous. Stupid, even.\n\nDown 27-14 in the third quarter, Denver needed to score on this drive, and it was stuck on third-and-3 from the Bengals\u2019 48-yard line. The short passes, as we know, were somewhat of an issue on Monday night, so Peyton Manning lofted a beautiful ball down the right sideline, and Sanders, man, caught the thing for a 33-yard gain. Three plays later, Sanders caught a touchdown.\n\nPound-for-pound \u2014 and the 5-foot-11, 180-pound Sanders doesn\u2019t have a lot of them, comparatively \u2014 Sanders might be the toughest dude on Denver\u2019s roster. Twice this season, play has stopped when Sanders was viciously hit by a defensive back. He takes Wes Welker \u201913 hits. But if he\u2019s not concussed, Sanders isn\u2019t bowing out; instead, yep, he\u2019s bowing to the crowd like a conductor and lining up at the line of scrimmage.\n\nAfter that catch, former NFL star Chad Brown tweeted, \u201cE Sanders may be the best front office move other than Peyton by John Elway. Great one hand grab, better free agent pick up.\u201d\n\nEntering Sunday\u2019s final regular-season game, Sanders has 95 catches for 1,331 yards and nine touchdowns. He was the only Bronco receiver to receive a positive grade Monday from Pro Football Focus. He\u2019s fifth in the NFL in receptions and sixth in yards, not bad for a No. 2.\n\nMore Sanders fun: He\u2019s on pace to finish the year in the top five in NFL history for catches and yards for a player in his first year with a team. And only Julio Jones of Atlanta has more 20-plus-yard catches this season than Denver\u2019s Sanders.\n\nChew on this\n\n\u2022 With Dec. 25 looming, resident Denver Post Christmas song expert Benjamin Hochman has ranked the 25-awesomest Christmas songs ever:\n\n25.
