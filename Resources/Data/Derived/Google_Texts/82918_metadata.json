Massacres and cruel violence were perpetrated by a number of factions, and clearly, neither \u2018moral equivalence\u2019 nor \u2018moral non-equivalence\u2019 are relevant here.\n\nNeither \u2018they\u2019re all as bad as each other,\u2019 nor \u2018a is worse than b.\u2019\n\nRather, the jargon term would be: incommensurable.\n\n(An unspeakable word in a highly polarized world).\n\nIn calling the various atrocities \u2018incommensurable,\u2019 I mean that there is no common scale of moral measurement with which to weigh them up. And so, neither \u2018moral equivalence/non-equivalence\u2019 are at stake here\u2026\n\nUnless you want politicians or other elite figures to play the inappropriate role of a frustrated parent or schoolteacher-pedagogue who says he wishes to \u201cbang the heads together\u201d of his wayward and uneducated children.\n\nTo speak of \u2018Serbian Genocide\u2019 or \u2018Serbian Crimes Against Humanity\u2019 (sic), while downplaying the crimes of other factions as \u2018mere straight-vanilla mass atrocities\u2019 is radically tendentious.\n\nIt is both profoundly flippant and breathtakingly ridiculous.\n\nAnd it is also cynical, and purely politically motivated.\n\nOf course, it does not take anything away from criticism of the crimes of some Serbians to also condemn the crimes of some individuals from other factions\u2026.\n\nEven if those addicted to emotional blackmail will opportunistically respond to the remotest step towards evenhandedness by screaming:\n\n\u2018YOU\u2019RE LETTING THESE GUYS GET AWAY WITH IT!!!\u2019\n\nI\u2019m letting them get away with it? Really? Perhaps, then, despite my best efforts to remain unaware of my own true cosmic potential, I am flatteringly credited with some gargantuan, godlike powers beyond my deserts?\n\nBe that is it may. But rather more consequentially, I will say that to question the sneaky special pleading here, to criticize how Serbian crimes are disingenuously framed in terms of an \u2018extra-special name,\u2019 while the crimes of others are to be brushed under the carpet, as mere non-descript-straight-vanilla-war-crimes-of-one-sort-or-another (sic)\u2026\n\nIs deemed to be the very epitome of bad faith.\n\nHowever, to act in a hooliganistic manner by disingenuously setting up a radically speculative and utterly untenable moral hierarchy, is the real act of bad faith.\n\nSo, this being the case, IntCom and their cheerleaders are all \u201cmass atrocity denialists\u201d par excellence, adopting Kosovar Albanians as their (perhaps unwilling) team mascots, and objectifying them, and indeed manipulating and abusing everyone who was attacked and abused and tortured and killed by any faction.\n\n\u2026\n\nQ: Who gets to decide what is a \u2018Genocide\u2019 or a \u2018Crime Against Humanity,\u2019 and what is merely a series of purportedly less serious war crimes or atrocities?\n\nA: Whoever has the power to do so.\n\n\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s as simple as that. No need to conveniently overthink it.\n\nMore next time.", "article_metadata": {"google-site-verification": "BJRhhAX0-HMwLuYcMtPOB6NAdO7bUX3D7seeI_tQT-Q", "generator": "Woo Framework Version 1.0.8"}, "article_summary": "Quick question:Who was it that committed mass atrocities in the Balkans?\nTo speak of \u2018Serbian Genocide\u2019 or \u2018Serbian Crimes Against Humanity\u2019 (sic), while downplaying the crimes of other factions as \u2018mere straight-vanilla mass atrocities\u2019 is radically tendentious.\nMassacres and cruel violence were perpetrated by a number of factions, and clearly, neither \u2018moral equivalence\u2019 nor \u2018moral non-equivalence\u2019 are relevant here.\nWell, the basic fact of the matter is that in the Balkans conflict, a large number of factions were involved in a vicious and violent civil war.\nIn calling the various atrocities \u2018incommensurable,\u2019 I mean that there is no common scale of moral measurement with which to weigh them up."}
