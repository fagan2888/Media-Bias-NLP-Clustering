And this progress has been even bigger for people of color: The uninsured rate among African-American adults has declined by more than 10 percentage points, compared to about 7.7 for the total population.\u201d\n\n\u2026.\n\nThe ACA is about more than the Marketplace. People are beginning to understand that the ACA is improving their care no matter where they buy their insurance. With new protections and required benefits, like preventive services at no extra cost, it\u2019s improved the quality of coverage for all Americans.\n\nThe promises made by Republican presidential candidates to repeal and replace Obamacare are looking like a political suicide mission as ACA enrollment continues to grow. By Election Day 2016, it is possible that the Republican nominee will be running on a platform of taking health care away from 20 million Americans.\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s health care law has not only been a political victory, but the President has changed health care delivery in a historic way. Thanks to the election of Barack Obama to the White House tens of millions of people have access to healthcare that they didn\u2019t have before.\n\nHundreds of millions of Americans are benefiting from the protections offered to consumers under the ACA. Obamacare has been a raging success, and Republicans are reeling as they to figure how to reconcile their repeal and replace rhetoric with the real life outcome of taking access to health care away from 17.6 million people.\n\nRepublicans have been captured in their own Obamacare trap, and the biggest winners aren\u2019t Democrats, but the 17.6 million people who now have access to affordable health care.", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama's signature health care law is surging past 2015 expectations as 17.6 million Americans have signed up under Obamacare.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Jason Easley", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "President Obama's signature health care law is surging past 2015 expectations as 17.6 million Americans have signed up under Obamacare.", "title": "Republicans Reeling After ObamaCare Enrollment Surges To 17.6 Million", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2015/09/22/republicans-reeling-obamacare-signups-surge-17-6-million.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Obama_On_Computer.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-09-22T14:50:23+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Editors' Picks,Featured News,Issues,aca enrollment,affordabe care act,how many people signed up for obamacare,Obamacare,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Issues", "published_time": "2015-09-22T14:49:29+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-22T14:50:23+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "aca enrollment, affordabe care act, how many people signed up for obamacare, Obamacare"}, "article_summary": "President Obama\u2019s health care law has not only been a political victory, but the President has changed health care delivery in a historic way.\nPresident Obama\u2019s signature health care law is surging past 2015 expectations as 17.6 million Americans have signed up under Obamacare.\nRepublicans have been captured in their own Obamacare trap, and the biggest winners aren\u2019t Democrats, but the 17.6 million people who now have access to affordable health care.\nObamacare has been a raging success, and Republicans are reeling as they to figure how to reconcile their repeal and replace rhetoric with the real life outcome of taking access to health care away from 17.6 million people.\nBy Election Day 2016, it is possible that the Republican nominee will be running on a platform of taking health care away from 20 million Americans."}
