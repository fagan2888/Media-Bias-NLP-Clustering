So... we are offering a free box of condoms to any Hobby Lobby employees who want them. Just message us on Facebook with your name and address and we'll send you a free box of Sir Richard\u2019s.\u201d Free boxes are also available by posting a message via its LinkedIn account.\n\nThe offer is supported by paid posts on Facebook and LinkedIn.\n\nOf course, executives don\u2019t know how many requests will really come from Hobby Lobby staffers, as, according to Sir Richard's CEO Tracey Forster, \u201cunless the numbers were astronomical, we aren't checking to make sure they are HL employees. Just trusting them.\u201d Still, the campaign's first day, July 11, garnered 14 box requests.\n\nTDA has vested interest in the project--it is a founding investor in Sir Richard\u2019s, a for-profit business with philanthropic goals that includes donating condoms to developing countries for each condom it sells. The agency and the condom company developed the campaign given their belief that employees\u2019 birth control choices are not their employers\u2019 business.\n\nThis is not the first time that the condom maker and the agency have garnered hot headlines. A couple years ago, for example, in response to the Rush Limbaugh/Sandra Fluke controversy, they ran a pro-\u201dslut\u201d campaign.\n\n\u201cWe're always on the lookout for Sir Richard's ideas,\" says Dan Colburn, copywriter, TDA_Boulder. \"The beauty of working on a condom account is the freedom we have to offer an opinion on issues that most brands can't touch. Art director Austin O'Connor and I were chatting about how frustrating it must be right now to be employed by Hobby Lobby, and from there we just connected the dots.\u201d\n\nTDA_Boulder, in Boulder, Colo., is a strategically-focused agency with $30 million billings from clients including FirstBank, Noodles & Company, General Mills, Deschutes Brewery, French\u2019s (condiments), Newton Running and Patagonia.", "article_metadata": {"description": "New Campaign Gives Out Free Condoms To Hobby Lobby Employees - 07/17/2014", "og": {"url": "http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/230169/new-campaign-gives-out-free-condoms-to-hobby-lobby.html", "image": "http://media.mediapost.com.s3.amazonaws.com/dam/cropped/2014/07/16/sir-richards-condom-188_2.jpg", "type": "website", "description": "The idea came from ad agency TDA_Boulder, which has a stake in the company, Sir Richard's Condoms, which is offering its product free to employees of Hobby Lobby in the wake of the Supreme Court\ndecision that the company is not obligated to cover the cost of their workers' contraceptives under the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "New Campaign Gives Out Free Condoms To Hobby Lobby Employees"}, "twitter": {"description": "The idea came from ad agency TDA_Boulder, which has a stake in the company, Sir Richard's Condoms, which is offering its product free to employees of Hobby Lobby in the wake of the Supreme Court\ndecision that the company is not obligated to cover the cost of their workers' contraceptives under the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "MAD: New Campaign Gives Out Free Condoms To Hobby Lobby Employees", "url": "http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/230169/new-campaign-gives-out-free-condoms-to-hobby-lobby.html", "image": "http://media.mediapost.com.s3.amazonaws.com/dam/cropped/2014/07/16/sir-richards-condom-188_2.jpg", "site": "@mediapost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 500591163}, "keywords": "The idea came from ad agency TDA_Boulder, which has a stake in the company, Sir Richard's Condoms, which is offering its product free to employees of Hobby Lobby in the wake of the Supreme Court decision that the company is not obligated to cover the cost of their workers' contraceptives ... 07/17/2014", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcff42\"", "article_summary": "So... we are offering a free box of condoms to any Hobby Lobby employees who want them.\nNow that the Supreme Court has ruled that retailer Hobby Lobby does not need to cover their employee's contraceptives under the Affordable Care Act, Sir Richards Condoms and ad agency TDA_Boulder are launching a social media campaign to provide free condoms to any Hobby Lobby employee who requests them.\nUnder the effort, Sir Richard\u2019s Facebook page features the message: \u201cWe believe everyone has the right to enjoy mind-blowing, safe sex.\nJust message us on Facebook with your name and address and we'll send you a free box of Sir Richard\u2019s.\u201d Free boxes are also available by posting a message via its LinkedIn account.\n\u201cWe're always on the lookout for Sir Richard's ideas,\" says Dan Colburn, copywriter, TDA_Boulder."}
