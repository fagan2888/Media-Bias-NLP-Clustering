However, on Monday, a federal judge ruled that precluding licensed retail gun stores from selling their merchandise is unconstitutional:\n\nA federal judge ruled Monday that Chicago's ban on virtually all sales and transfers of firearms is unconstitutional. \"The stark reality facing the City each year is thousands of shooting victims and hundreds of murders committed with a gun. But on the other side of this case is another feature of government: certain fundamental rights are protected by the Constitution, put outside government's reach, including the right to keep and bear arms for self-defense under the Second Amendment,\" wrote U.S. District Judge Edmond Chang. \"Chicago's ordinance goes too far in outright banning legal buyers and legal dealers from engaging in lawful acquisitions and lawful sales of firearms,\" he continued. Chang explicitly did not rule out other types of regulation, short of a complete ban, in order to \"minimize the access of criminals to firearms and to track the ownership of firearms. \"But the flat ban on legitimate sales and transfers does not fit closely with those goals,\" Chang wrote.\n\nWhile this is certainly good news for Second Amendment supporters, the ruling will not take effect right away:\n\nBut gun shops won't likely be showing up in Chicago any time soon, since Chang delayed his ruling from taking effect to allow the city time to appeal. Roderick Drew, a spokesman for the city's Law Department, said in a written statement Monday that Mayor Rahm Emanuel \u201cstrongly disagrees\u201d with the judge's decision and has instructed city attorneys \u201cto consider all options to better regulate the sale of firearms within the city's borders.\u201d\n\nIn short, the judge rejected arguments that the city\u2019s ordinances banning legal gun transactions in Chicago would further reduce crime. In his view, he wrote, \u201cevidence does not support\u201d that idea since most criminals obtain their guns illegally. Furthermore, he concluded (see above) law abiding citizens have a \u201cright to keep and bear arms for self-defense under the Second Amendment\u201d and that any law that infringes upon that right was patently unconstitutional. Even in a city like Chicago.\n\nIt\u2019ll be interesting to see what Mayor Rahm Emanuel does next.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The city of Chicago of known to have some of the toughest gun controls laws in the country. .05/26/2016 19:18:14PM EST.", "author": "Daniel Doherty", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "The city of Chicago of known to have some of the toughest gun controls laws in the country.", "title": "Daniel Doherty - Federal Judge Rules: Banning Gun Sales in Chicago is Unconstitutional", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/danieldoherty/2014/01/07/federal-judge-banning-gun-sales-in-chicago-is-unconstitutional-n1772998", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2013/238/9cb651fc-a2d1-4bf5-ba5d-2b757e2d6179.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "The city of Chicago of known to have some of the toughest gun controls laws in the country.", "title": "Daniel Doherty - Federal Judge Rules: Banning Gun Sales in Chicago is Unconstitutional", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/danieldoherty/2014/01/07/federal-judge-banning-gun-sales-in-chicago-is-unconstitutional-n1772998", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2013/238/9cb651fc-a2d1-4bf5-ba5d-2b757e2d6179.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Federal Judge Rules: Banning Gun Sales in Chicago is Unconstitutional , Daniel Doherty, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "However, on Monday, a federal judge ruled that precluding licensed retail gun stores from selling their merchandise is unconstitutional:A federal judge ruled Monday that Chicago's ban on virtually all sales and transfers of firearms is unconstitutional.\nThe city of Chicago is known to have some of the toughest gun controls laws in the country.\n\"Chicago's ordinance goes too far in outright banning legal buyers and legal dealers from engaging in lawful acquisitions and lawful sales of firearms,\" he continued.\n\"The stark reality facing the City each year is thousands of shooting victims and hundreds of murders committed with a gun.\n\"But the flat ban on legitimate sales and transfers does not fit closely with those goals,\" Chang wrote."}
