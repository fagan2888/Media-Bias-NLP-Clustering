In the latest data, which looks at 2014, the percentage of uninsured in the county had been trimmed to 6.4 percent.\n\nLocal health officials credit the federal Affordable Care Act.\n\nSince the initial enrollment period in 2013, 16,774 Marin residents have purchased insurance through Covered California, the state\u2019s health insurance exchange, and another 14,563 Marin residents have gained access to medical care via Medi-Cal, county officials said.\n\nThe change has been noted at the Coastal Health Alliance which operates community health centers in Point Reyes Station, Stinson Beach and Bolinas.\n\nAs of 2013, 32 percent of its patients were uninsured. That figure dropped to 23 percent in 2014 and 18 percent this year.\n\n\u201cWe are very proactive about enrolling people,\u201d said Steve Siegel, chief executive officer of the alliance. \u201cThe process can really be complicated. But the Affordable Care Act has had an impact.\u201d\n\nThose who are uninsured can still receive health care on a sliding scale, Siegel noted.\n\nPeople have varying reasons for not signing up for health care, some of it is financial.\n\n\u201cSome people have to make choices between health care and then food, gas and clothing,\u201d Siegel said. \u201cIt can be a rough system.\u201d\n\nWest Marin is an area where there is a high percentage of uninsured residents, according to U.S. Census Bureau data that was released as part of its 2010-2014 American Community Survey five-year estimates.\n\nWhile data lags as it does not show 2015 figures, it does provide a community-by-community snapshot of health insurance coverage. The data shows that 35.5 percent of people in Tomales are uninsured, the highest percentage in the county. It is followed by Lagunitas, where 18.5 percent of people are uninsured, then Marin City, where 17.2 percent of residents do not have healthcare insurance.\n\nBut the Marin City Health and Wellness Center \u2014 which has a health insurance enrollment counselor \u2014 reports 99 percent of its patients have coverage.\n\nThe large percentage of uninsured in Marin City indicates many have not signed up for health insurance and have not sought medical services from the Health and Wellness Center. San Rafael\u2019s Canal Neighborhood also has been deemed an under-insured \u201chot spot\u201d by Covered California. That means there are more remaining subsidy-eligible individuals per capita than the rest of the region.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut residents who are undocumented citizens are not eligible for Covered California, noted Tom Wilson, executive director of the Canal Alliance. For others, it\u2019s simply cost.\n\n\u201cWhen you compare the Canal to say Ross, the disparity is huge,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cYou can certainly connect affordability and health care. The poor put off health care and they don\u2019t end up getting preventative care.\u201d\n\nThe Canal being identified as a hot spot likely had an impact on San Rafael having the lowest percentage of people signed up for health care at 87.3 percent among Marin\u2019s incorporated cities and towns, according to census data.\n\nRoss had the highest percentage of covered residents at 98.7 percent, followed by Mill Valley at 97.9 percent and then Tiburon at 96.9 percent.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The number of Marin residents with health insurance coverage is on the upswing, according to U.S. Census Bureau data released this month.In 2008, the first year census data was collected on insurance, 10.3 percent of Marin residents were uninsu", "title": "Census: Number of Marin residents with health insurance growing", "og": {"url": "http://www.marinij.com/article/NO/20151225/NEWS/151229884", "image": {"width": "1500px", "identifier": "http://www.marinij.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/NO/20151225/NEWS/151229884/AR/0/AR-151229884.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "998px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Census: Number of Marin residents with health insurance growing"}, "twitter": {"domain": "marinij.com", "description": "The number of Marin residents with health insurance coverage is on the upswing, according to U.S. Census Bureau data released this month.In 2008, the first year census data was collected on insurance, 10.3 percent of Marin residents were uninsu", "title": "Census: Number of Marin residents with health insurance growing", "url": "http://www.marinij.com/article/NO/20151225/NEWS/151229884", "image": {"src": "http://www.marinij.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/NO/20151225/NEWS/151229884/AR/0/AR-151229884.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@marinij", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id551745144", "iphone": "id502957174", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.ladailynews"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "keywords": "marinnews, Health", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "marinnews, Health"}, "article_summary": "Since the initial enrollment period in 2013, 16,774 Marin residents have purchased insurance through Covered California, the state\u2019s health insurance exchange, and another 14,563 Marin residents have gained access to medical care via Medi-Cal, county officials said.\nBut the Marin City Health and Wellness Center \u2014 which has a health insurance enrollment counselor \u2014 reports 99 percent of its patients have coverage.\nIn 2008, the first year census data was collected on insurance, 10.3 percent of Marin residents were uninsured.\nWhile data lags as it does not show 2015 figures, it does provide a community-by-community snapshot of health insurance coverage.\nThe large percentage of uninsured in Marin City indicates many have not signed up for health insurance and have not sought medical services from the Health and Wellness Center."}
