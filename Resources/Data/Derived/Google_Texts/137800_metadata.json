In 1974, Republicans lost 48 seats in the House and four in the Senate. Republicans also lost over 700 seats in state legislatures, leaving them at their lowest level since 1938. After the election of Jimmy Carter in 1976, Democrats were back in power in Washington.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nConservative donors were undaunted. ALEC and Heritage continued to grow. When the right came back in full force in the election of 1980, Heritage was ready to offer a guiding hand. Once Ronald Reagan took office, the Heritage Foundation\u2019s legislative blueprint, \u201cMandate for Leadership,\u201d became the Reagan administration\u2019s \u201cpolicy bible.\u201d\n\nThe elections of 2006 and 2008, in turn, were interpreted as sounding the death knell for conservatism. \u201cThe new Democratic majority assembled by Obama represents the emergence of a Great Society electoral coalition,\u201dPhilip Klinkner and Thomas Schaller, political scientists at Hamilton and the University of Maryland\u2014Baltimore County, argued in the January 2009 edition of The Forum.\n\nNonetheless, conservatives maintained their investment in building state-level infrastructure, not only in ALEC but in the State Policy Network and the interlocking foundations created by Charles and David Koch.\n\nThe total investment of the right in state and local organizations now reaches well into the hundreds of millions.\n\nIn 2013, ALEC had a relatively modest budget of $7.3 million. That figure, however, distracts from a much larger investment by the right.\n\nWhen the State Policy Network was founded in 1986, it had 12 affiliated state-based groups and a goal of creating an \u201cinterstate freedom network\u201d to spread \u201cthe growth of freedom across America until a permanent freedom majority is built.\u201d Today, there are one or more affiliated organizations in every state.\n\nAn examination of IRS reports from all of these conservative groups shows total spending in just one year, 2013, of $142.2 million, with the Texas Public Policy Foundation\u2019s $8.9 million the largest expenditure.\n\nThe State Policy Network\u2019s single year total of $142.2 million is dwarfed by the network of foundations financed by Charles and David Koch and allied donors, individual and corporate.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe complex transactions between the foundations in the Koch Brothers network obscure the dollar amount of their investments in state and local organizations. But the Koch Companies\u2019 June Quarterly Newsletter notes that the Koch brothers \u201chope to raise $889 million by the end of 2016, about two-thirds of which will help support research and education programs, scholarships and other efforts designed to change policies and promote a culture of freedom in the United States.\u201d\n\nWhen Republicans swept the House and Senate in 2010, the earlier investments paid off. ALEC, the State Policy Network and the Koch foundations had a ready-made conservative agenda for newly empowered Republican legislators and governors, an agenda that has produced an upheaval in environmental regulation, labor law, voting rights and reproductive rights.\n\nConservatives have some inherent advantages in building a state and local infrastructure.\n\nRob Stein, a founder of the Democracy Alliance \u2014 a \u201cpartnership\u201d of liberal donors established in 2005 \u2014 pointed out in a phone interview that the right can tap into an embedded\n\nstructure of community-based cultural, religious, social organizations \u2014 churches, Elks, veterans halls, gun groups, local business organizations, etc. \u2014 that are gathering places with offices, meeting halls, phones and computers that can be used by activist troops for logistical and operational support.\n\nStein, who has worked in the field for decades, said that the result for conservatives is that\n\nyour volunteers and paid activists come out of a values-based institution, which is essentially not a political institution. People are there because of their values. If you come to politics from a club or church or veterans hall, it reinforces the stickiness of your work, your willingness to keep at it even if you are tired.\n\nBy comparison, Stein argued, \u201cprogressives don\u2019t have these community based, indigenous resources to educate, organize and mobilize troops anymore.\u201d With the exception of unions, \u201cwe have fewer local places to gather and belong.\u201d\n\nWhile organized labor remains influential in state elections, membership has collapsed to 6.6 percent in the private sector, and public sector unions are under sustained assault. This week, the five-member conservative bloc on the Supreme Court appeared prepared to deal another blow to the union movement in Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association.\n\nIn 2004, major liberal donors financed two new national groups created specifically for the 2004 presidential election \u2014 Americans Coming Together ($79,795,487) and the Joint Victory Committee ($71,811,666).\n\nDespite the investment, the Democratic nominee, John Kerry, lost. At that point, the liberal donor community came to general agreement that the left needed a secure a permanent infrastructure at the national level to compete with such conservative institutions as the Chamber of Commerce, the American Enterprise Institute, Americans for Tax Reform and Heritage.\n\nA year later, Democracy Alliance established its goal of building a \u201cprogressive infrastructure that could help counter the well-funded and sophisticated conservative apparatus in the areas of civic engagement, leadership, media, and ideas.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAt a national level, the alliance has played a significant role in the development of such groups as the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank; Catalist, which builds and maintains voter lists; and Media Matters, which seeks to document and discredit \u201cconservative misinformation throughout the media.\u201d\n\nLast year, the alliance initiated a program to direct a portion of members\u2019 contributions to state and local groups. I emailed Gara LaMarche, the president of the alliance, to ask how reliable alliance members are in continuing their support of relatively low-visibility state organizations. His answer:\n\nBy our best accounting, at the end of last year DA Partners gave about $15 million to these funds, on top of the almost $60 million they committed to the other DA Portfolio groups.\n\nLaMarche described the response as encouraging, noting that the alliance aims \u201cto at least double the contributions to the funds in 2016.\u201d\n\nLaMarche voiced some confidence that \u201cDA donors will stay the course.\u201d He acknowledged that\n\nour Partners don\u2019t have the bottom line personal or corporate financial interest that fuels a good deal of the right\u2019s giving, but I believe they increasingly get the importance and urgency of the state-level work, where the right has made such gains \u2014 with such damage to the progressive agenda \u2014 in recent years.\n\nDuring our conversation, Stein, who had helped start the organization, raised some doubts:\n\nIt has begun to appear that the twenty-first century progressive brain is not as interested in clubs, communities and cultural sharing as the conservative brain is.\n\nHow, Stein asked, \u201ccould we have lost that? How does a communitarian world view lose its communitarian sense of self?\u201d\n\nThe short answer to Stein\u2019s question may be that the nature of political liberalism has changed.\n\nThe liberalism of the 1930s and 1940s was shaped by the Great Depression, and the response was, in many respects, communitarian: the strengthening of unions, the provision of jobs and government benefits to the poor and unemployed and the creation of a safety net to provide a modicum of security.\n\nThe left has, in part, shifted focus, with more stress on the values of self-expression and self-fulfillment, on individual liberation from the constraints of traditional morality, especially sexual morality \u2014 what my colleague Ross Douthat calls \u201cThe Liberalism of Adult Autonomy\u201d or \u201cthe morality of rights.\u201d Economic liberalism \u2013 despite progress on the minimum wage - has lost salience.\n\nInstead of communitarian principles, the contemporary progressive movement \u2014 despite its advocacy of local issues like community policing \u2014 has produced a counterpart to conservative advocacy of free markets: the advocacy of personal freedom.\n\nInsofar as liberals continue to leave the state-level organization to conservatives, they are conceding the most productive policy arenas in the country.\n\nSign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, The Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.\n\nThe federal government, currently immobilized by partisan division, is now incapable of enacting major new initiatives, left or right. The passage of Obamacare in 2010 was the last such initiative. States are the place where new programs and policies are emerging on an almost weekly basis.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAs left interests are being cut out of this process, the groundbreaking work is being done on the right. The losses for the Democratic Party and its allies include broken unions, defunded Planned Parenthood, lost wetlands and forests, restrictive abortion regulations and the proliferation of open-carry gun laws.\n\nWhile the presidential race captures our attention \u2013 and as the left has withdrawn from low-level combat \u2014 conservatives have overseen the drawing of legislative and congressional districts that will keep Republicans in power over the next decade. In this way, through the most effective gerrymandering of legislative and congressional districts in the nation\u2019s history, the right has institutionalized a dangerous power vacuum on the left.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20160113032110, "twitter": {"description": "Conservative strategists understand that if you turn enough of the local map red, you can shrink the power of government just where you want it shrunk.", "title": "The Republican Party\u2019s 50-State Solution", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/13/opinion/campaign-stops/the-republican-partys-50-state-solution.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004141002"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/01/13/opinion/13edsallWeb/13edsallWeb-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/13/opinion/campaign-stops/the-republican-partys-50-state-solution.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004141002", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/13/opinion/campaign-stops/the-republican-partys-50-state-solution.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/campaignstops", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Jan. 13, 2016", "edt": "The New York Times on the Web", "org": "House of Representatives", "keywords": "Republican Party,Presidential Election of 2016,United States Politics and Government,Koch  David H,House of Representatives", "CN": "thomas-b-edsall", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Thomas B.
