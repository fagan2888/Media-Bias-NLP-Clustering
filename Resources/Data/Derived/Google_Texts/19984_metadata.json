The bill will halt the DOJ from preventing medical marijuana states \u201cfrom implementing their own State laws that authorize the use, distribution, possession, or cultivation of medical marijuana,\u201d it states.\n\nThough Democrats have been advocating such a measure for years, it was the support of Republicans this time that pushed the numbers over the top \u2014 passing it at a 56-40 bipartisan vote.\n\n\u201cThe war on medical marijuana is over,\u201d Bill Piper, a lobbyist with the Drug Policy Alliance, told the Los Angeles Times. \u201cNow the fight moves on to legalization of all marijuana. This is the strongest signal we have received from Congress [that] the politics have really shifted. \u2026Congress has been slow to catch up with the states and American people, but it is catching up.\u201d\n\nA Great Day For Common Sense\n\nAs of now, 32 states as well as the District of Columbia have legalized medical marijuana. Despite the fact that over the past several years, researchers and doctors have argued that marijuana does indeed have medical benefits \u2014 whether it eases nausea, headaches, or cancer patients undergoing the pain of chemotherapy \u2014 the Drug Enforcement Administration still lists marijuana in the most dangerous category of drugs and considers it worse than cocaine. This logic puts a dent in the nation\u2019s wallet, since the Obama administration has spent nearly $300 million on enforcing the ban on medical marijuana since President Obama came into office, according to Americans for Safe Access.\n\n\u201cThe federal government will finally respect the decisions made by the majority of states that passed medical marijuana laws,\u201d Rep. Sam Farr told the Huffington Post. \u201cThis is a great day for common sense because now our federal dollars will be spent more wisely on prosecuting criminals and not sick patients.\u201d\n\nPreviously, the DEA had raided marijuana dispensaries, arresting people who were complying with state laws but going against federal law. This served as a huge headache for people who relied on medical marijuana to treat their various disorders, and had a free pass in their state but constantly had to check over their backs to make sure the feds weren\u2019t after them.\n\nThere\u2019s still some more work to do before recreational marijuana is legalized federally \u2014 for one, pot advocates are working toward a proposal known as the \u201cSates\u2019 Medical Marijuana Patient Protection Act\u201d which would take marijuana off the list of Schedule I controlled substances, which includes LSD, heroin, and other drugs with \u201cno currently accepted medical use.\u201d Such an act would open the door for further much-needed research on the therapeutic effects of weed.\n\nBut in the meantime, marijuana advocates are rejoicing. \u201cThis is a victory for so many,\u201d Republican Rep. Dana Rohrabacher of Costa Mesa, a coauthor of the bill, said. The bill is \u201cthe first time in decades that the federal government has curtailed its oppressive prohibition of marijuana.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "medical marijuana, federal ban marijuana", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "In a new bill passed over the weekend, Congress has quietly ended the federal government\u2019s ban on medical marijuana.", "title": "The War On Medical Marijuana Is Over", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/war-medical-marijuana-over-congress-ends-federal-governments-ban-314552", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/16/medical-marijuana.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In a new bill passed over the weekend, Congress has quietly ended the federal government\u2019s ban on medical marijuana.", "title": "The War On Medical Marijuana Is Over", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/war-medical-marijuana-over-congress-ends-federal-governments-ban-314552", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/16/medical-marijuana.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/16/medical-marijuana.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Hill", "published_time": "2014-12-16T15:15:25-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-16T15:15:24-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "In a new bill passed over the weekend, Congress has quietly ended the federal government\u2019s ban on medical marijuana."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca89c\"", "article_summary": "After decades of a war against medical marijuana, Congress made history this weekend after approving a bill that will effectively end the federal government\u2019s ban on selling or using pot for health reasons in states where it\u2019s legalized.\nThe bill will halt the DOJ from preventing medical marijuana states \u201cfrom implementing their own State laws that authorize the use, distribution, possession, or cultivation of medical marijuana,\u201d it states.\n\u201cThe federal government will finally respect the decisions made by the majority of states that passed medical marijuana laws,\u201d Rep.
