Not in a combat zone, not in a civil disaster, not even in peacetime. Never. Nor have I lived through a time where our governing class was so deeply corrupt, so utterly foolish, and so dangerously focused on the perpetuation of its own power that it risked bringing down everything we have built not merely in the United States but in the entire West.\n\nRight now, if you are watching the news, you have questions about the future. And the answer to all of them is to buy ammo.\n\nBuying ammo is a no-lose proposition. Look, the worst thing that happens if you buy more ammo is that you have more ammo. Plus, much of our consumer ammo is made by hardworking Americans, and many of those ammo makers are located in red states where the right to keep and bear arms is celebrated and respected. So you\u2019re helping fellow conservative Americans, which is good. And you\u2019re infuriating people like that sanctimonious, Second Amendment-hating incompetent infesting the White House, which is great.\n\nOf course, buying ammo presumes you have already fulfilled your duty as a law-abiding, able-bodied American citizen and obtained sufficient firearms for the defense of yourself, your family, your community, and your Constitution. I can\u2019t tell you how many people in the last year have confessed to me that they have finally decided to visit their local gun seller to do what they had put off for far too long and transition from sheep to sheepdog.\n\nA handgun and a long weapon per adult is merely the minimum. We call that \u201ca good start.\u201d Now, while you can really efficiently carry only two weapons at once, when all hell breaks loose you\u2019re going to have friends who were the grasshopper to your ant and did not prepare for winter. You may wish to share the contents of your armory with them when the time comes; keep in mind that the only thing in a gunfight that\u2019s better than having a black combat rifle is having your buddy there to provide supporting fire with a black combat rifle.\n\nOr a shotgun \u2013 diversity is a good thing.\n\nDon\u2019t forget training. Malpractice with a weapon is a bad thing, particularly when the foolishness of our leaders has led to the kind of chaos where hospitals are deserted and antibiotics are hard to come by. I oversaw the weapons training of at least 20,000 troops over my career (Sergeants actually do the training; officers oversee the planning, resourcing, and big picture range operations, then find their sharpest sergeant to run them through some refresher drills so they can shoot \u201cExpert\u201d when they hit the firing line and qualify in front of everyone). I am a big fan of weapons training. You need to learn safety, and you also need to learn how to hit what you are shooting at. Don\u2019t be like the gangbanging, side-shooting nimrods in Democrat inner cities who can\u2019t hit the other scumbags they\u2019re shooting at and instead take out nice ladies walking home from church. Having lots of ammo on hand facilitates training.\n\nNow, many of our urban liberal friends will not understand why we insist on ensuring that we have plenty of guns and ammo. They are, not coincidentally, the same urban liberals who don\u2019t understand how creating economic and political chaos by screwing up the economy, coddling crooks, allowing unrestricted immigration, refusing to defeat our enemies, and frittering away the rule of law all act to undermine this wonderful island of relative peace and stability we call the United States. The \u00fcber-beta editor of a well-known liberal website once chided me on Twitter for pointing out the fact that civilization walks on a tightrope over a chasm of chaos, telling me I was essentially nuts for thinking this could all fall apart much faster and much more violently than any of us imagine. But I was not nuts. I was remembering. I was remembering Los Angeles on fire during the Rodney King riots. I spent three weeks on the streets with the Army during that little life lesson based out of an armory south of I-10 and east of the 405. Let\u2019s just say that it was a looty, shooty area. So I don\u2019t need chaos lessons from some tweedy femboy, nor do you. It may not be apocalypse now, but it could very well be apocalypse soon.\n\nDo you think our elite is going to protect you during the next \u201cuprising?\u201d Remember, it\u2019s a \u201criot\u201d only if elite liberals are at risk like they were when Beverly Hills got threatened; it\u2019s an \u201cuprising\u201d if only you are. Remember that \u201cstand down\u201d order in Baltimore?\n\nDo you think the Iranians and our other enemies haven\u2019t been watching Team Feckless in inaction and thought about popping off a hot rock or two a hundred miles above Kansas City to fry all our wonderful electronic gizmos with EMP? A couple days after our logistics networks go down those urban hipsters are going to learn what really constitutes a \u201cfood desert.\u201d\n\nDo you think a country this politically divided can\u2019t devolve into violence? People in Kosovo were pretty sure everything was hunky dory while Tito was alive. People resolved their differences through the institutions. And then Tito died, and the game changed. In just a few years, it became very bad.\n\nRight now we have a president who thinks he can ignore or modify the law unilaterally, justifying it with the baffling argument that he shouldn\u2019t have to ask Congress because Congress will just say \u201cNo\u201d \u2013 which I always thought was kind of the point of checks and balances. So what happens when President Clinton, who identified you and me and the 50% of Americans who aren\u2019t her supporters as her enemies, decides she gets to make her own laws because, well, she knows better and feels like it? Nothing good.\n\nBut deterrence is a wonderful thing. An armed, trained populace is not only prepared for when things go bad, but the fact that it is armed and trained makes it much less likely that things will go bad in the first place. Last year, Americans voted for liberty by buying well over 15 million new guns. That\u2019s roughly 40,000 a day, every day. That\u2019s enough to arm three infantry divisions.\n\nEvery. Single. Day.\n\nJust don\u2019t forget to buy ammo.", "article_metadata": {"description": "I have never, ever had anyone tell me that he had too much ammunition.  .05/27/2016 4:22:31AM EST.", "author": "Kurt  Schlichter", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "I have never, ever had anyone tell me that he had too much ammunition.", "title": "Kurt  Schlichter - Buy Ammo", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/kurtschlichter/2016/01/25/buy-ammo-n2109112", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/288/afa310ae-711b-4485-a89b-9fce4a46ab78.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "I have never, ever had anyone tell me that he had too much ammunition.", "title": "Kurt  Schlichter - Buy Ammo", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/kurtschlichter/2016/01/25/buy-ammo-n2109112", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/288/afa310ae-711b-4485-a89b-9fce4a46ab78.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Buy Ammo, Kurt  Schlichter, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "I am a big fan of weapons training.\nBut deterrence is a wonderful thing.\nLook, the worst thing that happens if you buy more ammo is that you have more ammo.\nAnd you\u2019re infuriating people like that sanctimonious, Second Amendment-hating incompetent infesting the White House, which is great.\nDon\u2019t forget training."}
