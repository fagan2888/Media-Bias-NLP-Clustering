Think big, she suggests, and integrate the COO into your strategic and vision plans. She suggests boards look at recent job descriptions that other organizations use when they recruit COOs. Trustees will notice that the jobs will sound similar to the characteristics and role of the chief executive officer.\n\nIncorporating the latest requirements for the role with the traditional responsibilities of the COO will help broaden the position, she says.\n\nHer column echoes similar comments she made last year in an interview with FierceHealthcare when she recommend that hospitals and healthcare systems cross-train COOs to help groom them to become CEOs.\n\nA 2015 report in Managed Healthcare Executive found that in the health insurance industry, the role of the COO has become more interchangeable with the job of the CEO. One reason for the shift is that healthcare has become a retail industry that incorporates sales, marketing, advertising and customer service to satisfy consumers--namely patients and purchasers, FierceHealthPayer previously reported.\n\nIn her latest column, Padilla urges COOs to push their organizations to broaden their roles. \"The healthcare chief operating officer role is not going to be well-defined any time soon. It will remain largely organization-dependent. And yet most hospitals and health systems can give the role more responsibility and muscle so that the COO makes a larger contribution towards operational and strategic objectives,\" she writes.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the column\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nCOOs take on greater role in health insurance industry\n\nLook internally to groom your next hospital CEO\n\nSuccession planning a 'responsibility' for healthcare leaders\n\nHospitals seek leaders with finance--not healthcare--experience", "article_metadata": {"description": "The role of the hospital chief operating officer (COO) is too limiting and confining says an executive from a leading recruitment firm who believes it's time for organizations to broaden the position's responsibilities.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "The role of the hospital chief operating officer (COO) is too limiting and confining says an executive from a leading recruitment firm who believes it's time for organizations to broaden the position's responsibilities.", "title": "The greater potential of the hospital chief operating officer", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/greater-potential-hospital-chief-operating-officer/2016-03-08", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "CEOs,chief operating officers,Donna Padilla,Operations & Business Management", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Operations & Business Management"}, "article_summary": "\"The healthcare chief operating officer role is not going to be well-defined any time soon.\nTrustees will notice that the jobs will sound similar to the characteristics and role of the chief executive officer.\n\"The role is not always viewed as a stepping stone to the chief executive position.\"\nShe advises healthcare organizations to think about the potential of the position and the impact the person who holds the position can have on the organization.\nThe role of the hospital chief operating officer (COO) is too limiting and confining says an executive from a leading recruitment firm who believes it's time for organizations to broaden the position's responsibilities."}
