Hayward, \u201cambiguity from the federal government leaves the Oregon Health Authority without a clear directive on whether or not the full range of reproductive health services, including safe and legal abortion, is offered under the Oregon Health Plan (OHP).\u201d\n\nWhile some women are transitioning from out-of-pocket and into state health care, Planned Parenthood continues to serve over 78,000 Oregonians each year, whether they qualify for Medicaid, have private insurance, or no insurance.\n\nPlanned Parenthood Advocates of Oregon (PPAO), a coalition partner, says this bill would streamline care. \u201cToday, women are buying plans and not receiving equal coverage for their pregnancy decisions,\u201d said Alicia Temple, PPAO Policy Director.\n\n\u201cSenate Bill 894 will clear up this confusion, giving Oregon women the clarity they need to make the right decisions for their family.\u201d\n\nLow-Income Women Are Hit the Hardest\n\nTo enforce the urgency of their bill, Sen. Hayward, along with Senator Sara Gelser, Representative Barbara Smith Warner, and Representative Alissa Keny-Guyer, presented a fact sheet to the legislature that noted about half of all pregnancies in the U.S. are unintended, and mostly among low-income women and women of color.\n\nThese two demographics experience the greatest setbacks from restrictions on health care, as well as immigrant women, young women, women who live in rural areas, transgender people and survivors of domestic violence.\n\nThe statistics brought forward also revealed that 70 percent percent of women who are sexually active and in their childbearing years are at risk of unintended pregnancy, as the cost of contraception is a considerable barrier.\n\nIn 2012, there were 471,860 Oregon women in need of contraceptive services and supplies. Of these, 266,690 were in need of publicly supported contraceptive services and supplies, 214,710 of whom had incomes below 250 percent of the federal poverty level.\n\nBrittany Flaherty, 25, works at a bakery in Northeast Portland and is a full supporter of the bill.\n\nShe has OHP now, which covers her birth control pills, but the road to getting the right coverage was a bumpy one. With an income hovering near the poverty line, she said she couldn\u2019t get the care she needed.\n\n\u201cI used to pay out of pocket for my birth control pills, which was extremely difficult,\u201d said Flaherty. \u201cI have reproductive issues and need to constantly take birth control, so I had to pay for extra packs. It was averaging $180 every three months.\u201d\n\nPeople of lower incomes do not often have employers that provide insurance, while state plans still leave holes. The Latino community is no stranger to this predicament.\n\n\u201cLatino women are the most under-insured or uninsured community, not just across Oregon, but across the nation,\u201d says Linda Sarai Roman, health equity policy coordinator at Oregon Latino Health Coalition.\n\nThe health risks that result in poor reproductive care are alarming, assures Sarai Roman. \u201cWhen a mother is not able to obtain prenatal care, she\u2019s three times more likely to give birth to a low-weight baby, and the child is five times more likely to die,\u201d she said.\n\nWomen\u2019s Reproductive Rights Under Attack\n\nThe nation\u2019s Affordable Care Act (ACA) requires insurers to cover a range of reproductive health services, including STD counseling and contraceptives.\n\nBut while it is a huge advancement for women\u2019s health, \u201csince the ACA was signed five years ago, and because the new federal law allows it,\u201d said Sen. Hayward, \u201c25 states have actually banned safe, legal abortion from being offered in their state-based health insurance plans.\u201d\n\nWith a pro-choice electorate, Oregon remains the only state left with no restrictions on access to safe, legal abortion. As it stands, OHP will cover abortions for low-income women, but it\u2019s not a law. That is where the proactive measure comes in.\n\n\u201cWe thought there was an opportunity to push for progressive legislation that would support women\u2019s reproductive autonomy, our personal decision-making,\u201d said Aimee Santos-Lyons, director of programs for Western States Center.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had three live births, an abortion, and have been contracepting for two decades,\u201d continued Santos-Lyons. \u201cSo my life has been full of different reproductive decisions, and I\u2019ve also had many levels of insurance coverage. For women, we need to know that whoever our insurer is, these needs will be covered.\u201d\n\nThe bill has met resistance. Oregon Right to Life PAC (Political Action Committee), which supports pro-life candidates for state and federal office, firmly opposes Senate Bill 894, which would omit text in the current legislation regarding religious exemption.\n\nThey claim the bill would require all insurers and employers to pay for surgical abortions, including churches and religious institutions.\n\nLiberty Pike, communication director at Right to Life PAC, said there are a variety of insurance policies in the state that already cover women\u2019s reproductive health, including abortion.\n\n\u201cThe specific problem with Senate Bill 894 is that it would force a religious organization to violate its deeply held, long-taught beliefs,\u201d Pike explained. \u201cI think widely in Oregon people agree that churches should be allowed to be exempt from these types of mandates. Senate Bill 894 is a run around to try to force them to violate their consciences.\u201d\n\nOregon Family Council has also released a statement against the bill. \u201cRequiring a church to pay for abortion coverage is an outrageous attack on religious liberty,\u201d they have stated.\n\nThe Senate would vote on the Comprehensive Women\u2019s Health Bill in April.\n\nWithout Oregon\u2019s existing publicly supported family planning services, the state\u2019s rates of unintended pregnancy, unplanned birth and abortion would be 83 percent higher, while the teen pregnancy rate would be 94 percent higher, according the bill\u2019s supporting facts.\n\n\u201cThese are serious pocket-book issues and they have lasting implications,\u201d said Aimee Santos-Lyons. \u201cWe don\u2019t talk about reproductive health care as if it\u2019s an economic security issue, and we know that it is.\u201d\n\nRelated Slideshow: Oregon Health Data Breaches\n\nThe following are health data breach reports from Oregon as listed on the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Civil Rights website.
