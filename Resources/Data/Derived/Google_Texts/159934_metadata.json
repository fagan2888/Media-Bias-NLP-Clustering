In 2015, if a saver put one million in the bank, the saver might receive 2% interest or $20,000 a year.\u201d\n\nIn 1970, the U.S. inflation rate was a robust 5.7 percent for the year. Thus far in 2015, the inflation rate has hovered between -0.2 percent and 0.2 percent.\n\nKiyosaki lauds Trump for his bankruptcies. He describes Trump\u2019s multiple corporate bankruptcies as \u201ca business tool.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmericans are sick and tired of corporate and political greed and incompetence in running our country,\u201d he writes. That\u2019s why \u201ceveryday Americans love Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nKiyosaki extols Trump for his celebrated negotiating acumen and his reputation as \u201ca fighter.\u201d Also, Trump is no \u201ccallous capitalist.\u201d \u201cLong before Obamacare,\u201d Kiyosaki assures readers, \u201cDonald spoke about providing free health and dental care for all children, up to the age of 18,\u201d regardless of the resources their parents have.
