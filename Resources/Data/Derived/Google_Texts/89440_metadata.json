This is proof positive, Stewart said, that Republicans are responsible for the shutdown, despite \"the party of personal responsibility\" trying to shift the blame.\n\nLook, an exasperated Stewart told the GOP, \"you think ObamaCare's a big enough threat to this country that you need to shut down the government over it? Fine. Own it. Don't fart and point at the dog.\" His next story, about Syria, kind of ends up being about the government shutdown, too, with an assist from Jessica Williams:\n\nThe best part of the show (watch at the top) is Jason Jones' attempt to get to the bottom of the whole shutdown thing with a Republican strategist named Noelle Nikpour. It didn't go well. Nikpour argued that in order to get the government back up and running, President Obama must agree to defund ObamaCare. Jones pointed out that the Affordable Care Act is the law of the land, and when Nikpour argued that it's unconstitutional, Jones threw up his hands and stopped the interview.\n\nInstead of leaving it there \u2014 a mildly amusing encapsulation of why we're in this shutdown \u2014 Jones turned to former FBI hostage negotiator Christopher Voss. Voss walked Jones through why people take hostages \u2014 they feel that they've run out of options, that they've become marginalized, and that people should be following their lead but aren't \u2014 leading Jones to confess that he thought talking to an actual hostage negotiator \"would be kind of funny\" but \"it's kind of incredible how this metaphor is lining up.\"\n\nVoss moved on. \"Even batshit insane has its own rules,\" he explained, and to talk with hostage-takers you figure out what those rules are \"and then you navigate within those rules.\" So Voss sent Jones back in to talk with Nikpour, talking him through the negotiation over an earpiece. Following Voss' advice, Jones tried to empathize and not be condescending \u2014 and failed. Like many of the subjects of these interviews, Nikpour is a pretty good sport, but let's just say the hostage doesn't emerge unscathed.\n\nTogether, Nikpour and Jones make a pretty convincing case that the GOP will win this battle, no matter what happens.
