(AP) \u2014 It\u2019s a tiny little memorial in the yard of an aging mobile home in a down-on-its-luck Mississippi mill town. Poster boards with votive candles form hearts, there are silk flowers and red, white and blue balloons. There\u2019s a sign demanding \u201cJustice 4 Jonathan.\u201d\n\nHere on Artesia Avenue is where Jonathan Sanders died after 10 p.m. on July 8, following a physical encounter with a white police officer for the town of Stonewall. What happened that night when Sanders \u2014 a 39-year-old black man riding in a two-wheel buggy pulled by a horse \u2014 crossed paths with Kevin Herrington \u2014 a 25-year-old part-time officer \u2014 is intensely disputed.\n\nLawyers for the Sanders family and witnesses who live in the mobile home say Herrington engaged in an unprovoked attack on Sanders after the two saw each other at a convenience store about a mile across town. C.J. Lawrence, the lawyer for three witnesses, said Sanders was doing nothing illegal and didn\u2019t resist while Herrington choked him to death.\n\nA lawyer for Herrington, though, said the officer found Sanders with what appeared to be illegal drugs. Sanders and Herrington struggled in the grass and Sanders grabbed Herrington\u2019s gun from his holster, only to drop it in the grass, attorney Bill Ready Jr. said.\n\nTrying to sort out the facts are the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation and the FBI. Herrington is on unpaid leave and left town on a family trip, Ready said. Sanders\u2019 survivors \u2014 including a mother, sister and two children \u2014 buried him Saturday.\n\nAuthorities are asking for calm while they finish investigating. But there were already two protests last weekend attended by hundreds in this town of 1,100 near the Alabama line.\n\nAnother protest is planned Sunday, as attorneys for Sanders\u2019 family paint his death as part of a larger nationwide struggle over police brutality against black men, and they see it as part of the unfinished civil rights movement in Stonewall, a town named after Confederate general Stonewall Jackson.\n\nChokwe Antar Lumumba, the Sanders family lawyer, said authorities told relatives that an autopsy found he died from \u201cmanual asphyxiation\u201d \u2014 strangulation. He said the manner of death was homicide, not accidental.\n\nA spokesman for MBI said the agency doesn\u2019t discuss ongoing investigations.\n\nThe autopsy finding doesn\u2019t necessarily mean Herrington committed a crime and accounts so far leave unanswered questions: What triggered the encounter? Was Herrington using necessary force, or was Sanders the victim of an overly aggressive officer?\n\nAnd at a time when police departments are under intense scrutiny for treatment of black suspects, did race play a factor?\n\nStonewall doesn\u2019t have cameras in police cars or on officers, putting the focus on witnesses. Clarke County Sheriff Todd Kemp said one witness is Rachel Williams, a jail guard in neighboring Lauderdale County.\n\nLawrence, the witnesses\u2019 attorney, won\u2019t confirm her name, or describe the others, except to say they are related and also distantly related to Sanders by marriage. Lawrence said the witnesses sought lawyers because they fear for their safety. Lawrence is a law partner of Lumumba, the Sanders\u2019 family attorney.\n\nAlso present at the time of the death were Herrington and his wife, Kasey Herrington, who was riding that night in his police car.\n\nThe lawyers for the witnesses relayed their accounts to The Associated Press but said they did not want to talk directly with reporters: The witnesses say Herrington drove up behind Sanders and flashed his blue lights, causing the horse to rear. Sanders fell off the buggy and chased the horse, while Herrington ran up and grabbed Sanders by the strap of a headlamp he was wearing that had fallen around his neck. They say Sanders fell to the ground in a fetal position, trying to relieve pressure on his neck but otherwise not resisting, while Herrington lay atop him and put him in a chokehold.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Black horse-trainer\u2019s death raises tensions in Mississippi", "title": "Black horse-trainer\u2019s death raises tensions in Mississippi", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Black horse-trainer\u2019s death raises tensions in Mississippi", "title": "Black horse-trainer\u2019s death raises tensions in Mississippi", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/07/19/black_horse_trainers_death_raises_tensions_in_mississippi/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/police-horse-drivers-death-funeral.jpeg1-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Black horse-trainer\u2019s death raises tensions in Mississippi", "title": "Black horse-trainer\u2019s death raises tensions in Mississippi", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/police-horse-drivers-death-funeral.jpeg1-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jeff Amy", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Chokwe Antar Lumumba, the Sanders family lawyer, said authorities told relatives that an autopsy found he died from \u201cmanual asphyxiation\u201d \u2014 strangulation.\nLawrence, the lawyer for three witnesses, said Sanders was doing nothing illegal and didn\u2019t resist while Herrington choked him to death.\n(AP) \u2014 It\u2019s a tiny little memorial in the yard of an aging mobile home in a down-on-its-luck Mississippi mill town.\nA lawyer for Herrington, though, said the officer found Sanders with what appeared to be illegal drugs.\nLawrence is a law partner of Lumumba, the Sanders\u2019 family attorney."}
