In June, Ms. Wood gave Ms. Glen and economic development officials a tour of her company\u2019s offices.\n\n\u201cWhile I did not intend to violate any provision of the City Charter, I now acknowledge that, by communicating with the deputy mayor, and thereby the mayor\u2019s office, on behalf of the firm within one year of the termination of my employment with the mayor\u2019s office, I violated\u201d a section of the charter, Ms. Wood affirmed in the disposition.\n\nIn the disposition, Ms. Wood noted that her company is not engaged in business dealings with the city. But \u201cI now understand that whether a firm is engaged in business dealings with the city is not relevant to whether a communication on behalf of the firm is prohibited by City Charter,\u201d she affirmed in the disposition.\n\nMs. Wood declined to comment on the resolution of the case.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "A former aide to Mayor Michael Bloomberg was fined $2,000 by the New York City Conflicts of Interest Board for interacting improperly with current Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s administration after she left City Hall, the board said Wednesday.", "title": "Former Michael Bloomberg Aide Fined for Improper Contact With City Hall", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2015/03/11/former-michael-bloomberg-aide-fined-for-improper-contact-with-city-hall/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-HJ106_NYWOOD_P_20150311145650.jpg"}, "site": "WSJNY", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "New York", "article.headline": "Former Michael Bloomberg Aide Fined for Improper Contact With City Hall", "description": "A former aide to Mayor Michael Bloomberg was fined $2,000 by the New York City Conflicts of Interest Board for interacting improperly with current Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s administration after she left City Hall, the board said Wednesday.", "article_section": "New York", "author": "Michael Howard Saul", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Metropolis Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Metropolis", "article.summary": "A former aide to Mayor Michael Bloomberg was fined $2,000 by the New York City Conflicts of Interest Board for interacting improperly with current Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s administration after she left City Hall, the board said Wednesday.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2015-03-11T18:10:08-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-139", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2015/03/11/former-michael-bloomberg-aide-fined-for-improper-contact-with-city-hall/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-METROB-22697", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "New York", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "A former aide to Mayor Michael Bloomberg was fined $2,000 by the New York City Conflicts of Interest Board for interacting improperly with current Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s administration after she left City Hall, the board said Wednesday.", "title": "Former Michael Bloomberg Aide Fined for Improper Contact With City Hall", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2015/03/11/former-michael-bloomberg-aide-fined-for-improper-contact-with-city-hall/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-HJ106_NYWOOD_P_20150311145650.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Metropolis", "article.id": "BL-METROB-22697", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-03-11T19:21:30-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe15bb\"", "article_summary": "New York City Hall BloombergA former aide to Mayor Michael Bloomberg was fined $2,000 by the New York City Conflicts of Interest Board for interacting improperly with current Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s administration after she left City Hall, the board said Wednesday.\nIn June, Ms. Wood gave Ms. Glen and economic development officials a tour of her company\u2019s offices.\nIn the disposition, Ms. Wood noted that her company is not engaged in business dealings with the city.\nMs. Wood joined the communications team at Kickstarter, a New York City-based company, in November 2013, a month before Mr. Bloomberg left office.\nMs. Wood declined to comment on the resolution of the case."}
