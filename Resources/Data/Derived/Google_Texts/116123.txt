You've awarded a "rose" [Howard Buffett dishes on dirt, Oct. 18] to Howard Buffett who "farms 20,000 acres on three continents — including in Illinois, Nebraska and Arizona." I have no idea what Buffett is doing about conservation matters on those 20,000 acres, but he is not farming them, and it's insulting to farmers world-wide that you call him a farmer. He's an agricultural investor who has other people working for him.

Buffett will never stay up with a sick cow or get his hands dirty. Our world needs (and must support) more real farmers, not more agricultural investors.
