Then it leveled out a bit when enrollment closed. So how are things going in its second year?\n\nThe latest Gallup numbers tell the story. During the first month of open enrollment, the uninsured rate dropped moderately, and then dropped sharply again during the first quarter of 2015. It's now down to 11.9 percent:\n\nThis is great news, and confirms previous reports. As before, according to Gallup, the biggest drops have been among the young and those with low incomes. This represents millions of people who can now get decent medical care without fear of bankruptcy, and it's being done at a surprisingly moderate cost. It's just inconceivable to me why Republicans are so hellbent on ruining a program that's showing such great results and such great promise for so many people.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Mother Jones Magazine", "og": {"url": "http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2015/04/chart-day-yet-more-good-news-obamacare", "site_name": "Mother Jones", "image": "/sites/all/assets/mojo_nomaster.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Chart of the day: Yet more good news for Obamacare"}, "twitter": {"title": "Chart of the day: Yet more good news for Obamacare", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2015/04/chart-day-yet-more-good-news-obamacare", "image": {"src": "/sites/all/assets/mojo_nomaster.jpg", "identifier": "/sites/all/assets/mojo_nomaster.jpg"}, "creator": "kdrum", "site": "@MotherJones", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"admins": "13301307,670317733,1198876232,38509772,106892,2907757,306289,602422192,4101301,513450539"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "Health+Care", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-150x150.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3dcb\"", "article_summary": "During Obamacare's initial open enrollment period, the uninsured rate dropped dramatically.\nDuring the first month of open enrollment, the uninsured rate dropped moderately, and then dropped sharply again during the first quarter of 2015.\nAs before, according to Gallup, the biggest drops have been among the young and those with low incomes.\nIt's just inconceivable to me why Republicans are so hellbent on ruining a program that's showing such great results and such great promise for so many people.\nThis represents millions of people who can now get decent medical care without fear of bankruptcy, and it's being done at a surprisingly moderate cost."}
