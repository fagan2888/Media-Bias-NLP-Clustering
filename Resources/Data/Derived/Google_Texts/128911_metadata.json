Revenue rose 12% to $14.8 billion, topping analyst views for $14.6 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, Centene (CNC), a Medicaid-centric HMO that has benefited from the health law\u2019s Medicaid expansion, reported that its Q4 EPS popped 29% to $1.74, beating estimates by 5 cents.\n\nRevenue surged 53% to $4.73 billion, boosted by the company\u2019s participation in health insurance exchanges and expansions in a variety of states.\n\nIts health benefit ratio rose to 89.3% during Q4 from 88.1% a year ago. Centene expects a health benefits ratio of 89.2%-89.6% this year.\n\nThe company also guided full-year GAAP EPS of $5.05-$5.35 on revenue of $20.3 billion-$20.8 billion.\n\nShares edged up 0.7%.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Aetna on Tuesday raised its full-year earnings per share guidance, driven by higher membership and lower costs for Gilead Sciences' hepatitis C drugs.
