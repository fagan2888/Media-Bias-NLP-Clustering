Spotlight on … Marcell Dareus, defensive tackle, Bills

When: 2:05 p.m. Sunday, when the 7-5 Bills play the 9-3 Broncos at Sports Authority Field at Mile High.

What’s up: The 6-foot-3, 331-pound Dareus leads NFL defensive tackles with 10 sacks, even though he’s had none in his past three games. Tampa Bay’s Gerald McCoy is next with 8½ sacks.

Background: Dareus grew up in Birmingham, Ala., then attended the University of Alabama. He was a starter as a sophomore for the Crimson Tide’s 14-0 national championship team in 2009. He was selected by the Bills with the No. 3 pick in the 2011 NFL draft — one slot behind where the Broncos acquired Von Miller and eight slots ahead of where Houston selected J.J. Watt.

Klis’ take: The 2011 draft was the first order of business for the Broncos’ new football operations team led by John Elway, John Fox, Matt Russell and Brian Xanders. Most mock drafts had the Broncos picking Dareus, because they had a gaping need in the middle. Russell, though, pushed hard for Miller.

The night before the draft, the Broncos were 80 percent certain they were drafting Miller, because he was the more dynamic player. The other 20 percent was for Dareus, but cornerback Patrick Peterson was in the discussion. Watt would have been the best choice. But Miller and Dareus have been good players too. In some ways, this is an apples and oranges comparison. Miller is an edge pass rusher with 47 sacks in four seasons. Dareus is an inside player with 28½ sacks.

Because the Bills have Mario Williams, Dareus was the correct pick for them. Because the Broncos have Terrance Knighton, Malik Jackson and Derek Wolfe to push the middle, Miller was the correct pick for them.
