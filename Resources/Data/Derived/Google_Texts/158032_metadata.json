Jon S. Corzine\u2019s administration, has served as the director of two Princeton University programs assisting states with implementing the Affordable Care Act and healthcare-delivery reform. She\u2019s also a lecturer at the university, where she teaches classes on both the ACA and state and local health policy.\n\nWhy she continues to make a mark: Officials in other states have cited research by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation-backed State Health Reform Assistance Network, led by Howard, in describing why they decided to expand Medicaid.\n\nWhy she remains passionate about healthcare: \u201cIt\u2019s a civil rights issue,\u201d she said: A lack of healthcare access can prevent people from achieving their full potential. She added that healthcare remains the top cause of personal bankruptcies, and healthcare spending can crowd out other government priorities, from the environment and education to transportation funding.\n\n\u201cIf you care about domestic policy and politics you need to care about healthcare,\u201d, she said.\n\nA personal issue: Howard also has experienced the healthcare system firsthand, when her son Nate Howard, then 2, had a cancerous tumor in a bone. While he was successfully treated and is now 12, the experience caused her to reflect on differences in access to care.\n\n\u201cIf the ACA were not the law he could have been denied health insurance throughout his life, because he had a pre-existing condition as a cancer survivor,\u201d said Howard. She acknowledged that New Jersey had a state law barring insurers from denying coverage based on pre-existing conditions, but added that many other states didn\u2019t have that protection.\n\nA longtime health policy wonk: Howard, a native of Westchester County, New York, worked for her local congresswoman, U.S. Rep. Nita Lowey, after graduating from Duke University. That gave Howard her first exposure to national health policy, since Congress was then debating President Bill Clinton\u2019s health-reform proposal.\n\nMany angles to health law: Howard has seen healthcare laws from many perspectives. After working for Lowey, she attended New York University\u2019s School of Law and was a judicial clerk, then a trial attorney for the U.S. Department of Justice Antitrust Division\u2019s healthcare task force.\n\nHer thoughts on a former boss: Between working for the Justice Department and Corzine, Howard served on the White House domestic policy council, including as a senior policy advisor to then-First Lady Hillary Clinton.\n\nHoward said she\u2019s excited about Clinton\u2019s campaign announcement on health policy, including recently unveiled plans to address autism and Alzheimer\u2019s research, as well as what she says are \u201csensible changes and improvements to the ACA.\u201d\n\nLegacy in the state Department of Health: Howard said the top challenge as commissioner was managing the Department of Health and Senior Services in a time of \u201cserious fiscal constraint,\u201d in which she relied on what she calls \u201can amazing staff\u201d in \u201ctrying to do more with less.\u201d\n\nBut Howard also helped reshape the state\u2019s approach to hospitals facing potential closures due to financial distress. Building on the work of a commission led by her current Princeton Univeristy colleague, Professor Uwe Reinhardt, the state began to do more planning to shape how much financial assistance hospitals should receive. The state \u201creally did move away from crisis management\u201d toward strategic planning, she said.\n\nOther areas of long-term change: The department also expanded services in maternal and child health, as well as in autism services, which Howard sees continuing to grow under her successors as commissioner. The state also expanded access to New Jersey FamilyCare, which continued to grow under the ACA.\n\nThe grind of Medicaid expansion: Howard sees the expansion of Medicaid -- which has reached 30 states and is under discussion in four others -- following a similar path to the original Medicaid program. It took 17 years from when Medicaid was enacted in 1965 until the last state -- Arizona -- adopted it.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ll get there on the Medicaid expansion, hopefully in less than 17 years, but it will take time,\u201d Howard said.\n\nHoward said the research done by the Princeton-based network she leads spells out why -- states save money in their budgets, as money they currently spend on charity care for hospitals is replaced by Medicaid.\n\nNo turning back on ACA: \u201cIt may be slow, but inexorably social programs like the ACA become entrenched, become a part of the fabric\u201d of society, Howard said. She predicts that despite criticism of the ACA by some Republican presidential candidates, the next president will find it difficult to take away benefits that millions of people have begun to rely on.\n\nChristie and Medicaid: Howard said Gov. Chris Christie and other Republican governors who chose to expand Medicaid were \u201cbrave.\u201d But she contrasts Christie\u2019s position with those of other Republicans who weren\u2019t governors.\n\n\u201cGovernors see the reality of their budgets,\u201d Howard noted. \u201cI think at the national level, the political discussion is a little bit removed from that reality.\u201d\n\nPotential for state-level reforms: While Obamacare has consumed much of the national debate, Howard sees broad, bipartisan interest in state governments in addressing further healthcare reform. That includes a shift toward paying healthcare providers for the value they provide patients -- by keeping them healthy while keeping costs down -- instead of the volume of services they provide.\n\n\u201cBecause so much of state budgets go to healthcare, there\u2019s a lot of opportunity,\u201d she said.\n\nTownship council: In addition to being immersed in state and national health policy, Howard is familiar with local policy as a Princeton Township councilwoman. She said she decided to run in 2012 because she loves living in what she says is a \u201ca wonderful community\u201d with \u201creally engaged, smart, committed residents . I wanted my son to grow with seeing the value of civic engagement\u201d and \u201cwhat it means to be a progressive in government at the local level.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s led to her supporting local health laws like banning smoking in public parks and raising the age to buy tobacco to 21. She was sworn in to her second term on Monday. But she hasn\u2019t looked to run for higher office, saying that the part-time council work fits in well with her academic and policy jobs.\n\n\u201cFor me, this is really the right mix,\u201d she said.\n\nFamily life: In addition to her son, Howard\u2019s family includes her husband Hunter Labovitz, a lawyer in the Federal Community Defender Office in Philadelphia.\n\n_________________________________________________\n\nNJ Spotlight, an independent online news service on issues critical to New Jersey, makes its in-depth reporting available to NewsWorks.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Who she is &nbsp Heather Howard http //wws princeton edu/faculty research/faculty/heatherh 47 a former New Jersey commissioner of health and senior services in Gov Jon S Corzine\u2019s administration", "title": "Profile: A councilwoman who doubles as an Obamacare expert", "og": {"image": "http://www.newsworks.org/nw_logo_fb.png", "site_name": "Newsworks.org", "description": "Who she is:\u00a0Heather Howard, 47, a former New Jersey commissioner of health and senior services in Gov.
