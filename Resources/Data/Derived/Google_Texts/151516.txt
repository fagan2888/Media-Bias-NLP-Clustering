PHOENIX — Another Republican is running for Arizona governor in 2014.

State Treasurer Doug Ducey officially announced his candidacy Wednesday morning in Phoenix.

“I’m here to announce that I will seek, and with your help, we will win, the office of governor for the state of Arizona,” Ducey told his supporters. “I’m running to get Arizona’s economy going.”

He says his experience with building the Coldstone Creamery chain will help him do that.

“I built a company, now I want to shrink a government and build an economy,” he said. “Together we can make it happen.”

Ducey told supporters that, as governor, he would work to get rid of Obamacare.

“America needs to break out of Obamacare before Obamacare breaks America. Arizona can lead the way.”

He also said that education would be one of his top priorities.

“We will reward good teachers with good pay, and we will make principals the educator-in-chief of their school. We will eliminate wait lists while doing everything that’s in the best interests of our children.”

Ducey is the fifth Republican to announce a run for governor.
