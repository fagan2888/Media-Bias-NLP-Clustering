For a guy trying to put together a comeback bid for the White House in 2016, that\u2019s obviously not the greatest news. Late in the evening on Friday, a Texas grand jury indicted its governor on charges that he abused his authority and attempted to coerce a public servant. The news exploded on Twitter with a mixture of confusion, Schadenfreude and obvious jokes.\n\nThen people actually read through the indictment and got a grasp of the circumstances surrounding it. The whole story revolves around Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, one of the few Democrats to hold a position of real power in Perry\u2019s government, and her 2013 arrest for driving drunk. After she was taken in, Lehmberg berated her arresting officers and made some poorly concealed threats against them. And it was all caught on videotape. She ended up pleading guilty and served a couple of weeks in prison.\n\nPerry saw the opportunity to evict Lehmberg and replace her with an ally, so he threatened to veto funding for the Public Integrity Unit (which investigates ethics violations in the government and is under the Travis County DA\u2019s control) if Lehmberg didn\u2019t resign. Lehmberg refused, so Perry followed through in his threat and vetoed the funding. The coercion and abuse of authority charges derive from Perry\u2019s veto threat. It was undoubtedly a cynical and arguably scummy use of the governor\u2019s power, but did it rise to the level of a crime?\n\nLet\u2019s look at a few opinions from political observers:\n\n\u201cLegal training of any kind seems unnecessary to grasp its flimsiness.\u201d \u201cThe indictment announced Friday of Texas Republican Gov. Rick Perry may sound explosive, but it looks very weak on paper.\u201d \u201cThe basis for the indictment is exceptionally weak, and reflects a disturbing trend towards criminalizing garden-variety political actions.\u201d \u201cThe special prosecutor bringing these charges may need to overcome a significant constitutional obstacle.\u201d \u201cIt is not going to be easy for prosecutors to convince a trial jury that a governor wielding his veto power in even the rawest, most ad hominem form, as Perry did here, amounts to a crime.\u201d\n\nWho are these five pundits downplaying the case against Texas\u2019 Republican governor? In order: New York magazine\u2019s Jonathan Chait, MSNBC host Ari Melber, political scientist and American Prospect contributor Scott Lemieux, the Center for American Progress\u2019 Ian Millhiser, and the New Republic\u2019s Alec MacGillis. Five guys who work/write for big-name liberal publications or organizations. This, friends, is the Hack Gap in action.\n\nThe Hack Gap is defined as the relative lack of left-leaning pundits and media types who will abandon principle in order to move the political ball forward. \u201cConservatives outscore us considerably in the number of bloggers/pundits/columnists/talking heads who are willing to cheerfully say whatever it takes to advance the party line, no matter how ridiculous it is,\u201d Mother Jones\u2019 Kevin Drum wrote of the Hack Gap back in 2012. The Hack Gap can be viewed different ways, depending on the context. In a vacuum, it\u2019s a good thing, insomuch as faithfulness to one\u2019s principles is viewed as a positive quality. And when real moments for political accountability arise, like the Veterans Affairs scandal, depriving a politician of his or her political cover can help speed the process along. In the context of a political campaign, the Hack Gap can be viewed as a negative \u2013 you want everyone on the same boat rowing in the same direction.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Tons of big-time liberals are saying Rick Perry's indictment looks weak.
