As part of this decision, the FCC will consider whether \u2013 as suggested by the Department of Justice Antitrust Division among others -- to adopt rules that keep AT&T and Verizon from strangling competition.\n\nSpectrum auctions, spectrum squatting, and the road to duopoly\n\nFederal law requires that anyone offering a wireless service more powerful than WiFi have a license from the FCC. The FCC distributes these licenses (shorthanded as \u201cspectrum licenses\u201d or just \u201cspectrum\u201d) through auctions. The system protects users from interfering with each other, but it also places a natural limit on how many providers we can have at any time.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nUnfortunately, this makes it possible for a sufficiently large company (or companies) to block competition by buying up enough licenses to keep rivals from offering a reliable network \u2013 especially as the growth of smartphones and tablets keeps putting more demand on the network. This strategy \u2013 called \u2018foreclosure\u2019 by the Department of Justice or \u2018spectrum squatting\u2019 by the wireless industry \u2013 has proved very effective for the two largest carriers in the past. Instead of focusing on building better networks or offering better prices to compete for customers, AT&T and Verizon have focused on buying up the most valuable \u201cbeachfront\u201d low-band spectrum that penetrates inside buildings better and travels further than high-band frequencies and keeping those low-band licenses out of the hands of competitors.\n\nIn the last major auction in 2008, AT&T and Verizon bid a combined $16 billion to dominate the auction and shut out rivals. Since the 2008 auction, AT&T and Verizon have both spent billions of dollars strategically buying out their smaller rivals, and refusing to enter into roaming agreements (agreements to share spectrum in regions where one does not have enough coverage) with anyone else. Data kept growing as a bigger and more important part of the wireless market, but spectrum squatting by the two biggest carriers effectively prevented anyone else from building a mobile network that could compete.\n\nThis vicious cycle sliding toward an AT&T/Verizon duopoly continued until the federal government blocked AT&T\u2019s bid to take over T-Mobile in 2011, and forced Verizon to sell off some spectrum licenses to rivals in 2012.\n\nOnce the government blocked AT&T and Verizon from monopolizing the spectrum license market, competition started to return to the actual wireless market. In the last two years we have seen competing carriers \u2013 particularly T-Mobile \u2013 invest billions of dollars in their networks and offer consumers innovative new packages and pricing plans. Consumers have responded enthusiastically, forcing AT&T and Verizon to offer their own lower priced plans.\n\nLet the real market decide\n\nLooking at this history, the FCC has proposed setting aside 30 MHz as a \u2018reserve\u2019 for competing carriers. AT&T and Verizon will be able to bid on the \u2018unreserved\u2019 spectrum, which will at least equal and most likely exceed the amount of reserved spectrum. This follows the example of Canada\u2019s recent very successful auction of similar spectrum, which raised more than twice the anticipated revenue while introducing new wireless competitors in the market.\n\nAT&T and Verizon have launched a frantic last minute campaign to eliminate the reserve and retain the right to once again foreclose competition by buying up the licenses. In a nice spot of Orwellian messaging, supporters of AT&T and Verizon accuse the FCC of \u2018acting like a cartel\u2019 and \u2018picking winners and losers\u2019 by refusing to let AT&T and Verizon monopolize the spectrum.\n\nBut the proposed spectrum reserve lets consumers, rather than the government spectrum auction, \u2018pick winners and losers.\u2019 Eliminating the reserve would convert the auction of spectrum licenses into an auction for a government-sanctioned duopoly. If we really \u201cwant the market to decide\u201d -- the actual wireless market where customers choose the carrier that provides the best prices and the best service \u2013 then the FCC needs to keep the spectrum reserve when it votes on Thursday.\n\nFeld is Public Knowledge's senior vice president.
