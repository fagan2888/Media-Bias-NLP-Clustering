I called out the growing subterranean panic three weeks ago. Now with CNN polling revealing movement away from Hillary, the conservative press ( here , here , and here , for instance) is joining me in highlighting the panic that the Democrats still fear open mention of.\n\nNo Democrats are willing to go on the record with their doubts about Hillary Clinton\u2019s electability \u2013 not even the gaggle of hopeless, sad-sack nominal opponents for the nomination: Lincoln \u201cmetric system\u201d Chafee, Bernie \u201csocialism now!\u201d Sanders, and Martin \u201cthe guy who taxed rain \u201d O\u2019Malley. But a shocking potential rival is waiting in the wings.\n\nThe problem for the Dems is that their bench is ridiculously thin. Leave aside the joke candidates already in the field, and all they\u2019ve got is Elizabeth Warren, who, for all her socialist rhetoric (and personal profiteering from real estate flipping) and her affirmative action gamesmanship as a phony Native American, is a good talker. But even in deep blue Massachusetts she was unable to deliver a convincing victory in her Senate run. And perhaps knowing about more hypocrisy in her background, she is not anxious at all to throw herself into a run for the White House, with all the scrutiny that would entail.\n\nSo is there a knight in shining armor willing to ride in and save the Dems? Michael Goodwin of the New York Post (hat tip: Powerline) has a fascinating report of what may be going on hidden from the public (for now):\n\n\u2026now comes word of a bid to entice another big-name challenger, and this one is far more intriguing. It aims to get former Mayor Michael Bloomberg into the race. New York Dems friendly to Bloomberg have approached him to gauge his interest. Their argument is that Clinton\u2019s vulnerability with general-election voters, especially independents, could result in a Republican president. They also believed Bloomberg could be interested because, as one of them told me,\u201cMike can\u2019t stand Hillary.\u201d One visitor to the former mayor came away cautiously optimistic after a 30-minute meeting, noting that Bloomberg didn\u2019t throw him out of the office or start fiddling with his smartphone. \u201cThat means he wasn\u2019t bored and was listening,\u201d said another man who talked to the three-term mayor. They were also encouraged that Bloomberg said something to the effect that it would be \u201cno problem\u201d for him to drop his unaffiliated registration and become a Democrat again.\n\nBloomberg has an enormous ego and a hunger to tell other people how to live their lives. He also the kind of wealth (estimated at $36 billion) that makes self-financing a presidential campaign no problem at all. Goodwin makes the case:\n\nHis strengths would be considerable, substantively and politically. His astonishing business success and record as a bold, can-do mayor in America\u2019s largest city could appeal to voters of all persuasions. He is socially liberal, being pro-choice, an early advocate for gay marriage and a relentless supporter of more gun control. He\u2019s also a security hawk who supported the Iraq invasion, and was religious about keeping New York safe from crime and terrorism. Indeed, crime rates fell to historic lows under him, a record that burdens his hapless successor. Bloomberg also believes in pay-as-you-go government, once arguing to me that he is a true conservative because he will raise taxes to provide services the public wants. He talks with conviction about big ideas like public health and infrastructure. His most glaring weakness is that he lacks foreign-policy experience at a time when the world is on fire. However, Bloomberg is far from parochial, as both his business and philanthropy span the globe. He\u2019s a wooden campaigner, but there\u2019s an easy answer for that: The incumbent is charismatic, and look at the mess he made! Blanketing the country with TV ads can cover a lot of sins.\n\nStand by. This could get extremely interesting. Hillary would not react well to a challenge from a former Republican, no matter how nominal. And if Dick Morris is to be believed, she does not harbor kind feelings toward Jews, especially those whose wealth dwarfs hers and who did not stick it out in an unhappy marriage. Hillary plays dirty, and you can expect American Bridge to unearth a lot of secrets from Bloomberg\u2019s private and business life if he moves ahead on this intriguing notion.\n\nYippee! There\u2019s nothing quite like a steel cage death match involving Hillary with someone who\u2019s smarter and richer than she is.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2015/06/the_panic_that_dare_not_speak_its_name_hillary_looks_like_a_loser_to_dems.html", "image": "http://www.americanthinker.com/assets/images/at-painter-og-image.png", "title": "Blog: The panic that dare not speak its name: Hillary looks like a loser to Dems"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "New York Dems friendly to Bloomberg have approached him to gauge his interest.\nThere\u2019s nothing quite like a steel cage death match involving Hillary with someone who\u2019s smarter and richer than she is.\nI called out the growing subterranean panic three weeks ago.\nHis astonishing business success and record as a bold, can-do mayor in America\u2019s largest city could appeal to voters of all persuasions.\nThe problem for the Dems is that their bench is ridiculously thin."}
