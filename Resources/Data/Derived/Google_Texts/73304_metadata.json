But in a bracket full of traditional powers this year, it will be the old guys who lead the way to the promised land.\n\nEast Regional\n\nFavorite: North Carolina\n\nThe Tar Heels are a top seed in the NCAA Tournament for the 15th time. This is an experienced group, led by talented senior guard Marcus Paige and 6-foot-10 classmate Brice Johnson, a walking double-double. The Tar Heels won their final five games \u2014 and seven of their last eight \u2014 including a victory over Virginia in the ACC Tournament championship game Saturday. The path through the East won\u2019t be easy for them, but the Tar Heels have sharpened Final Four tools.\n\nSleeper: Indiana\n\nYes, the Hoosiers were stunned in the quarterfinals of the Big Ten Tournament on a buzzer-beating game-winner by Michigan, but they have been among the country\u2019s most consistent teams after a rough start to their season. And who doesn\u2019t want to see a second-round matchup with fourth-seeded Kentucky?\n\nUpset alert\n\nStephen F. Austin over West Virginia. Experience counts for a lot in the NCAA Tournament, and the Lumberjacks have plenty of it. They have been to the tournament three consecutive times, advancing to the round of 32 two years ago.\n\nBracket breakdown\n\nSimply put, the East is a beast. Stacked with traditional power programs in Kentucky, North Carolina, Indiana and Wisconsin, this bracket has no shortage of star power. The top five seeds in this bracket have combined for 18 national championships. That means this bracket\u2019s Final Four team will have earned the trip.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Upperclassmen all the rage in East region of NCAA tournament", "title": "Upperclassmen all the rage in East region of NCAA tournament", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/03/13/upperclassmen-all-the-rage-in-east-region-of-ncaa-tournament/", "image": {"width": 558, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160313__BN20160314_B7_BNSPXXBKCXXCAPLEDE-1201-2773p1.jpg", "height": 654}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160313__BN20160314_B7_BNSPXXBKCXXCAPLEDE-1201-2773p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-13T22:04:43+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-14T22:13:37+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "East RegionalFavorite: North CarolinaThe Tar Heels are a top seed in the NCAA Tournament for the 15th time.\nFreshmen have certainly found a way to leave their mark on the NCAA Tournament in recent years.\nExperience counts for a lot in the NCAA Tournament, and the Lumberjacks have plenty of it.\nThe path through the East won\u2019t be easy for them, but the Tar Heels have sharpened Final Four tools.\nStacked with traditional power programs in Kentucky, North Carolina, Indiana and Wisconsin, this bracket has no shortage of star power."}
