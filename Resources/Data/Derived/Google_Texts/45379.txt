Fort Worth police arrested a suspect Friday in last month’s shooting death of 56-year-old Sylvia Salazar at a bar near the Stockyards.

Police said Mark Anthony Pacheco, 30, was taken into custody on a felony murder warrant at a relative’s home without incident. He was also shot, police said, in the Feb. 16 gunfight that broke out inside North Side Outlaws bar at 115 NW 25th St.

Salazar was struck by a stray bullet, according to police. She was taken to John Peter Smith Hospital, where she died a short time later.

The arrest was first reported Friday by the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.

Pacheco was booked in the Mansfield City Jail, with bond set at $150,000.
