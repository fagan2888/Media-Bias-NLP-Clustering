The Lakota ambulance service is in danger of shutting down due to a lack of community support.\n\nLAKOTA, N.D. \u2014 Lakota Ambulance and Quick Response is on life support.\n\nThe elixir for revival is volunteers. But they seem to be in short supply in the Nelson County governmental seat of 650 residents.\n\nThe local ambulance service has just seven active volunteers, with most of them on call 35 to 50 hours a week \u2014 in addition to their full-time jobs \u2014 just to maintain the state-required 24/7 schedule to keep its license.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re one trip and fall or one back injury away from closing up,\u201d said Tami Bulik, the ambulance service\u2019s only employee. \u201cYou go to bed at night and you hope nobody\u2019s family has a heart attack or some other emergency overnight.\u201d\n\nLakota is not alone, according to Kenneth Reed, community paramedic coordinator for the North Dakota Department of Health\u2019s Emergency Medical Services Division and EMS director at Heart of America Medical Center in Rugby.\n\n\u201cThis is troublesome to all of us,\u201d he said. \u201cLakota is just a symptom of what is happening all over the state right now. The money is not the issue. The problem is lack of volunteers.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s becoming more common,\u201d he said. \u201cSome may have larger rosters, but there\u2019s just a small percentage who are active with the ambulance. It\u2019s created an artificial sense of security.\u201d\n\nThat security vanished earlier this year in Goodrich, a small town northeast of Bismarck, when the local ambulance service shut down.\n\n\u201cThey were down to one EMT, and she was rather elderly.\u201d Reed said. \u201cShe was trying to hang in there the best they can,\u201d Reed said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing in a lot of these communities. They\u2019re hanging on as long as they can, but it\u2019s very difficult to attract new, young people to give the time commitment.\u201d\n\nHundreds of hours\n\nDoris Karas and Jack Davidson know all about time commitment.\n\nKaras has been a volunteer with the service for 25 years, serving 150-plus hours monthly, plus her full-time job in town at Lakota Drug.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty much 24/7,\u201d she said, sometimes forcing her to leave her job to answer a call. \u201cI don\u2019t like to leave work, but I don\u2019t want to know what might happen if we can\u2019t respond.\u201d\n\nDavidson, the Nelson County auditor, has been with Lakota Ambulance for 31 years, averaging 200 hours or more per month.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s on call just about every day. We\u2019d be lost without Jack,\u201d Bulik said.\n\n\u201cThe biggest thing is you have to be ready to go,\u201d Davidson said. \u201cYou can\u2019t go to the bar to have a drink. You can\u2019t leave town. You\u2019re very limited in what you can do. The thing is we don\u2019t have a lot of calls. But when we do have a call, it\u2019s sometimes pretty major.\u201d\n\nHe said the current lack of volunteer drivers is forcing emergency responders (EMRs) and EMTs to take extra shifts.\n\n\u201cIf we could get a few more people, we could schedule people for weekends, and we\u2019d have some time off,\u201d Karas said.\n\nErin Fossen is one new volunteer who has responded to Lakota\u2019s emergency call. She just started training to become a driver and an EMT.\n\nI\u2019ve always had an interest and there\u2019s a dire need for it,\u201d Fossen said. \u201cThe majority of our community is 40 and over.\u201d\n\nShe knows about the commitment, too. Her father, Stanley Schrupp, was a volunteer for more than 20 years, before retiring because of health reasons.\n\nBulik said they need more.\n\n\u201cThe desperate need is for EMTs, but if we can attract volunteer drivers, we can train,\u201d Bulik said. \u201cThe first goal is to get them started as volunteer drivers, then as EMR, then EMTs.\u201d\n\nSearching for answers\n\nThe Lakota Ambulance board currently is reorganizing, according to Bulik.\n\nOne of the options is to raise mill levy the service receives through property taxes to be raised from the current 0.73 percent to 5 percent, the maximum allowed without a separate public vote.\n\nThe current levy brings in about $5,500 annually, according to Davidson.\n\nThe board meets Oct. 1. If it decides to pursue a mill levy increase, the decision must be made by February. However, the extra money would not be available until 2016.\n\nThe money would be used to increase the small stipend volunteers receive for their service, said Bulik. Volunteer drivers and EMRs are paid $15 per run, while EMTs get $25 per trip.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d like to get it to where they get paid $1 an hour just to carry a pager,\u201d Bulik said.\n\nThe North Dakota Department of Health requires that any licensed ambulance service provide 24/7 availability, with at least two qualified personnel on duty for every ambulance call.\n\n\u201cThe financial support is really good in Lakota,\u201d Davidson said. \u201cMoney has not been an issue. It\u2019s getting volunteers. Some of us are getting older.\u201d\n\nMergers as remedies\n\nOne option to stay open in Lakota is to merge with Michigan Ambulance Service. Michigan, N.D., is 11 miles east of Lakota.\n\nUnder the substation arrangement, Michigan would assume ownership of all Lakota Ambulance assets, according to Jason Flom, EMT trainer in Michigan.\n\nIt would keep one ambulance at the Lakota station, he said. If a call comes in from the Lakota service area, Michigan would prepare to answer it. If two qualified people from Lakota are available, the Michigan crew would not respond.\n\nIf Lakota would close, its service area would be divided among several other ambulance services, including Michigan, McVille, Edmore and Lake Region in Devils Lake.\n\nMichigan would get the majority of calls, because it is closest to Lakota, which is home to a Good Samaritan Nursing Home.\n\nThat\u2019s the same route that was taken recently in Finley, when Finley Ambulance Service merged with West Traill Ambulance Service, headquartered in Mayville, about 25 miles away.\n\nAnother substation agreement is working between Mohall and nearby towns in north-central North Dakota.\n\nIf Michigan would absorb Lakota Ambulance operations, it would nearly double its service area. Michigan currently serves 432 square miles, while Lakota covers 378 square miles.\n\nMichigan had some troubles with attracting new members a few years ago. However, they never got to the point of possible closure, according to Flom. Today, it has 22 members, with 18 considered active.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re currently stable, but we have three to five people who would like to retire in the next couple of years. Some of them have been here for 35 or 36 years,\u201d Flom said.\n\nMichigan Ambulance, which operates on 4.5 mills, currently pays volunteers $30 for an ambulance run and $1 an hour for volunteers when their pagers are on. Holiday pay is $50 for a run, plus an increased hourly on-call wage.\n\nEvery minute counts\n\nBulik believes a merger should be a last resort.\n\nAlthough Michigan is just 11 miles away, in reality, she said, it may take 20 to 25 minutes before an ambulance can respond to an emergency in or near Lakota.\n\n\u201cIf you have a heart attack in Lakota, that\u2019s too late,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery minute counts.\u201d\n\nFlom agrees.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping the community takes them seriously,\u201d Flom said. \u201cSome say they\u2019re crying wolf. They\u2019re not.\u201d\n\nWhile mill levies and mergers provide some hope of relief, Reed said the dilemma is likely to spread to other small communities, especially in eastern North Dakota, where rural depopulation is continuing.\n\n\u201cThere are funds available for grants,\u201d Reed said. \u201cWe have some of the best-equipped ambulances in the country. There\u2019s been funding available. All of the cost of training is covered by the state.\n\n\u201cThe problem is lack of volunteers,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only way funding will help is if we get funding to hire full-time people. Then you have to decide, Do we want to pay someone full-time to respond to 30 calls a year?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "News,state,first responders", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Forum News Service", "og": {"site_name": "Jamestown Sun", "description": "LAKOTA, N.D. \u2014 Lakota Ambulance and Quick Response is on life support.\r\nThe elixir for revival is volunteers.
