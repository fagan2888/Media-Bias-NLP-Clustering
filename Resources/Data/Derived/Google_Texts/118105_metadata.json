Earlier this summer, the 22 year old singer took Whitney Houston\u2019s \u201cHow Will I Know\u201d and slowed the tempo to create a haunting cover, and now Smith is putting his imprint on Tracy Chapman\u2019s \u201cFast Car.\u201d\n\nBBC Radio 1\u2018s Live Lounge shared a video of the singer performing the tune alongside a live band, including a cellist. The result is Smith\u2019s own unique take on an intense tune about an effort to escape generational poverty.\n\n\u201cWhen I was in primary [elementary] school, I was in Year 6, so I was like, 10 years old, and I went to this award thing with my head teacher\u2014I don\u2019t know why\u2014and I remember being in the car and she was playing Tracy Chapman, and I\u2019d started singing along to \u2018Fast Car\u2019 and that was the reason why I sang in the first-ever school show I ever sang in, because she heard me. So, I\u2019ve always loved Tracy Chapman since that moment.\u201d\n\nThe song, which earned Chapman a Grammy, has been covered by Swimming with Dolphins, Wayne Wonder and David Usher. In 2010, Rolling Stone named the tune one of the 500 greatest songs of all time.\n\nSmith debut album \u201cIn the Lonely Hour\u201d became a chart-topper in the U.K. in after claiming the number one spot after outselling Coldplay by 20,000 copies.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "British soul singer Sam Smith has a way with songs from the 1980s.
