Critics said Jandreau pushed for the alcohol sales, but the late chairman insisted he wanted a dry casino.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t push for alcohol in the casino,\u201d Jandreau said at the time. \u201cBut I had a responsibility to follow the direction of the council.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Lower Brule Sioux Tribe bans alcohol sales\n\nIn 2010, as the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs continued to investigate alleged regional mismanagement at IHS, Jandreau recalled that some of the issues had \u201cbeen going on for years and years and years.\u201d He went on to say, \u201cif there is some serious criminal behavior, it will get tended to; and if not, it will clear up the perception.\u201d\n\nRELATED: IHS investigation proceeds\n\nJandreau was also one of a few tribal leaders who spoke up in 2013 in response to the Keepseagle decision allowing the lawyers to control $380 million of the settlement as reported by ICTMN. At the time some tribal leaders were cautious fearing being cut out of any possible deal in retaliation.\n\nRELATED: Tribes Don\u2019t Like Keepseagle Lawyers Controlling $380 Million of Settlement\n\nJandreau, himself, was not without controversy. The chairman spent his final days fighting back against allegations of financial wrongdoing outlined by Human Rights Watch in January according to the AP. Amid the accusations were diverting money and concealing financial activity.\n\n\u201cI believe in myself. I believe in what I\u2019ve committed my life to, and so every day I talk to that guy first, and I go through my life,\u201d Jandreau told the AP on February 28 pointing upward. \u201c\u2026I\u2019ve lived my life with one thought in mind: that what I reach beyond this life is more important to me than becoming a wealthy man by skullduggery or wickedness.\u201d\n\nUpon Jandreau walking on, Kevin Wright became acting chairman and immediately fired three lawyers who he says were allies of Jandreau\u2019s as part of the alleged wrongdoing according to the Argus Leader.\n\nDespite the conflicts, many remembered him as a tireless champion for his tribe on Thursday, not to mention for all of Indian country.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Michael Jandreau, the late Lower Brule Sioux Tribal chairman, was remembered on Thursday as hundreds of mourners paid tribute to a Native icon.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "kpolisse", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/04/11/hundreds-pay-tribute-michael-jandreau-controversial-icon-159971", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/michael_jandreau_lower_brule_sioux_tribe_-_joe_kafka_ap_file_photo_0.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Hundreds Pay Tribute to Michael Jandreau, a Controversial Icon"}, "abstract": "Michael Jandreau, the late Lower Brule Sioux Tribal chairman, was remembered on Thursday as hundreds of mourners paid tribute to a Native icon.", "dc": {"title": "Hundreds Pay Tribute to Michael Jandreau, a Controversial Icon"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/04/11/hundreds-pay-tribute-michael-jandreau-controversial-icon-159971", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Michael Jandreau, Lower Brule Sioux Tribe, Tex Hall, Three Affiliated Tribes, Walked On, Passed On, Controversy, Keepseagle, Indian Health Service, Alcohol Ban, Economic Development", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.date": "2015-04-11T09:00-04:00", "dcterms.title": "Hundreds Pay Tribute to Michael Jandreau, a Controversial Icon"}, "article_summary": "Michael Jandreau, the late Lower Brule Sioux Tribal chairman, was remembered on Thursday as hundreds of mourners paid tribute to one of Indian country\u2019s controversial icons according to the Associated Press.\n\u201cHe was devoted to the Lower Brule people.\u201dJandreau walked on April 3 due to heart problems, he was 71 years old.\n\u201cI always knew him as chairman,\u201d Tex Hall, former Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation chairman said via AP.\nThroughout his years as chairman, Jandreau was outspoken when it came to issues such as alcohol sales on the reservation, Indian Health Service investigations and the Keepseagle case.\nCritics said Jandreau pushed for the alcohol sales, but the late chairman insisted he wanted a dry casino."}
