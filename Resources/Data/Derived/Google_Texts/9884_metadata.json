I will not lie, there were lots and lots of classes,\u201d said Columbus-area H&R Block Office Manager Angie Schoen.\n\nSchoen says for most people, who get insurance through work, the change will be simple.\n\nThey check a box on their tax form that says they had health insurance all year.\n\nHowever, if you were uninsured last year, the penalty is $95 per person or one percent of your yearly income, whichever is greater.\n\nFor 2015, the penalty is $325 or two percent of your income.\n\nSchoen says do not wait until the last minute to file.\n\n\"I would rather people know they owe the money and have a few months to plan, because they don't have to pay it until April 15,\u201d said Schoen. \u201cAnd also with the budget cuts with the IRS, and it taking 21 days to get their refund, it's better to get it in as soon as possible.\"\n\nMaurice Thompson says it is his responsibility to engage in civil disobedience to disobey what he sees as an unjust law.\n\nThompson says he will deal with the change in tax code in a way that makes sense to him.\n\n\"I'm simply not going to pay the penalty when I file my taxes on April 15th,\u201d said Thompson.\n\nAnd says he'll remain uninsured.\n\nTax preparers say refusing to pay the penalty is no different than refusing to pay taxes, and the IRS will treat it the same.\n\nIf you want to avoid those penalties next year, keep in mind the deadline to sign up for insurance is February 15.\n\n\n\nMore Information - Affordable Care Act Website", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Affordable Care Act could mean a change to how you file your taxes.", "og": {"site_name": "WBNS-10TV Columbus, Ohio", "description": "The Affordable Care Act could mean a change to how you file your taxes.", "title": "No Health Insurance?
