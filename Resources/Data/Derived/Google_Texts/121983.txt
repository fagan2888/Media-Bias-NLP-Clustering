A 78-year-old Mount Pleasant man was killed Sunday while working on private property in Berkeley County.

James Ray Ouzts, whose exact address was not released, was struck by a truck about 10:30 a.m. in the Alvin Community, according to Berkeley County Coroner Bill Salisbury.

Ouzts was behind the pickup giving directions when it backed over him and into a tree, Salisbury said. He was pinned under the truck and removed by the Berkeley County Rescue Squad and the local fire departments.

Ouzts died at the scene and his death was ruled accidental, Salisbury said.
