By joining Indiana AG Greg Zoeller's lawsuit, officials in 39 school districts hope to avoid the law's requirement that large employers offer insurance to full-time workers.

WASHINGTON — The 39 Indiana school districts that challenged the Affordable Care Act still have a chance to pursue their case, despite the Supreme Court's rejection of the main part of their pending lawsuit.

The Supreme Court's decision Thursday upholding the law's subsidies did not address another aspect of the schools' suit — whether the penalties the schools are subject to if they don't provide health insurance to employees violate the 10th Amendment protection of state sovereignty.

"The 39 public schools will be continuing with their arguments that it's not permissible under the 10th Amendment to impose the employer penalties on the schools," said Jim Hamilton, a partner with Bose McKinney and Evans, who is representing the schools.

The schools had joined with Indiana Attorney General Greg Zoeller in suing the federal government in hopes of avoiding the law's requirement that large employers offer insurance to full-time workers.

Although the state and the schools already provide health insurance to full-time employees, their definition of full-time is different than the federal law's definition. School corporations have cut the hours of bus drivers, teachers' aides and others who haven't been getting insurance to make sure they don't work enough hours — 30 hours a week — to qualify for health care under the law.

If opponents' challenge to the ACA's subsidies had been successful, employers could not have been penalized for not providing insurance, because the penalties are triggered if a worker needs a subsidy to get coverage.

Now that that aspect of the schools' suit has been decided, U.S. District Judge William T. Lawrence can address the state sovereignty issue.

Before putting the case on hold pending Thursday's Supreme Court decision, Lawrence had said Zoeller cannot make the 10th Amendment claim for the state. That's because Indiana was part of the first challenge to the ACA in which the 10th Amendment claim was raised and rejected.

Lawrence still has to rule on whether the schools have the right to make that case.

Hamilton said he is not deterred by the fact the Supreme Court has now ruled twice in favor of the law.

"Today's decision ... cannot be read more broadly in terms of limiting future legal challenges," he said. "We were hoping for relief today. We didn't get it."

But Josh Blackman, a conservative legal blogger and associate law professor at South Texas College of Law, said Chief Justice John Roberts has effectively said, "We're done here."

"The battle over Obamacare isn't over, but today the chief justice signaled it won't go through the courts," Blackman said.

Beth Cate, an associate professor at the Indiana University School of Public and Environmental Affairs, said the schools can be encouraged by the fact the court has spoken out strongly on the importance of federalism and of state sovereignty being respected. That includes its 2012 decision upholding the constitutionality of the ACA — but giving states the final say on whether Medicaid would be expanded.

"So we know that a majority of justices on the court cares about federalism," she said. "The question really is, will they see this employer mandate as a real hit to federalism or not."

On the one hand, Cate said, government employers are subject to a wide variety of regulations that also apply to private employers. On the other hand, there's a "particular antipathy to having the feds tax the states even if they can otherwise regulate the states as employers to some extent."

If the schools win their 10th Amendment argument, that won't have the same collateral effects on subsidy recipients as the main part of their challenge would have. Rather than invalidating subsidies in Indiana, a win for the schools under what's left of the challenge would affect public employers and their workers, who would not be subject to the employer penalties for not providing insurance.

"The 10th Amendment argument would apply only to the state and local units of governments — cities, towns, counties," Hamilton said.

Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell said Thursday she can't comment on pending litigation.

"What I will say is, with regard to the application of how employers are treated, we have followed the statute and continue to do that," she said.
