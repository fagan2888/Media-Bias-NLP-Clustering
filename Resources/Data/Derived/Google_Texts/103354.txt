Denver police officers responding to a burglary just south of Stapleton on Thursday discovered two bodies.

The burglary was reported at a home in the 1900 block of Trenton Street about 3:15 p.m.

Police, who first announced the “death investigation” on the department’s Twitter page about 4 p.m, offered no other details, saying more information would come after the investigation.

Police would not comment on the manner of death or other specifics, such as gender of the bodies, but they said there was no danger to the neighborhood.

Officers, who cordoned off the street, were interviewing neighbors early Thursday evening.

Shortly after 6 p.m., the Denver Police Mobile Crime Lab arrived at the scene.

About that time, police detectives, who had been waiting for a search warrant, entered the house.

David Nobin, 23, who lives in an apartment complex across the street, said the neighborhood was a quiet one overall and that he felt safe living there.

He said he was “shocked.”

“It was really scary to learn,” he said.
