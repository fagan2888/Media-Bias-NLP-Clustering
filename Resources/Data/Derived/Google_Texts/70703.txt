September 20, 2013 – Charleston, S.C. – U.S. Senate candidate Nancy Mace issued a statement today regarding the legislation passed in the U.S. House of Representatives that would defund Obamacare.

Mace stated, “Increasing costs and regulations in the so-called Affordable Care Act will suffocate individual liberty and further stifle economic growth. We must use any means possible to repeal, defund and ultimately stop Obamacare.”

Mace continued, “Public support for this law is falling through the floor, and working people and small businesses alike are searching for relief from Obamacare. With numerous exemptions and waivers granted by this administration it is clear, even the most ardent proponents of Obamacare understand it is deeply flawed.

I believe defunding Obamacare, and ultimately repealing this bill is not only the best option, but the only option legislators have to address this policy before it imposes even more damage on our healthcare system and the greater economy.”

Mace added, “We need market-based reforms that would empower individuals and allow broader choices across state lines for health insurance options. These commonsense ideas provide a framework for more affordable and accessible healthcare without interfering in the doctor-patient relationship.”
