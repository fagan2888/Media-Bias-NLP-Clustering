When many disabled veterans return home from combat, they aren't returning to the houses they left. Many must move into a nursing home or assisted living facility that can handle their injuries.

In 2009, Senator Dick Durbin introduced and passed legislation that would allow disabled veterans to return home. They would be placed in the care of a loved one, thus naming it the VA Caregivers Program.

Durbin says the VA spends more than $300,000 per veteran each year in nursing homes. Through his program, veterans injured while fighting post 9/11 were able to get a stipend to live at home. The program helped more than 22,000 severely disabled veterans. The VA gave them $36,000 and trained their caregivers in basic nursing.

Senator Durbin has joined with Senator Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin to expand the program to any disabled veteran. Now, 88,000 more veterans could move home and get the help they need.

Hillary Clinton originally introduced the bill when she served in the senate. Senator Durbin took over for her when she went to the State Department.
