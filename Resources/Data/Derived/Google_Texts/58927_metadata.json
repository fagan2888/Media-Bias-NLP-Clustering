The gala is 5:30-8:30 pm this Saturday at The Hall at Fauntleroy; tickets are still available here. In advance of his return to West Seattle, Sen. Daschle spent a few minutes chatting with WSB by phone from Washington, D.C. \u2013 read on:\n\nTom Daschle wanted to stress that he\u2019ll be \u201cspending some time talking about how proud we are of (Steve Daschle\u2019s) leadership and his extraordinary accomplishments over (the past 25 years). \u2026 I also want to talk about the future and what role I think (SWYFS) and the people involved will have in affecting the quality of life for thousands of people \u2026\n\n\u201cI think these efforts and the efforts of SWYFS are even more important than they would have been 25 years ago when my brother started .. in part a change in demographics and extraordinary growth in the (low-income) population, four times as many as in the 1970s, a far greater need than perhaps existed at any other time, and you see a reluctance and a dimunition in the resources available from at least the federal government, and I think that makes the challenge of providing services through centers like this critical \u2026 vitally important.\u201d\n\nThese days, nine years since his career in Congress ended, the former senator is working \u201cprimarily on health care and health policy in a number of contexts,\u201d mostly for the law firm DLA Piper, and the impending implementation of the Affordable Care Act. He also has been working for \u201cthink tanks\u201d including the Bipartisan Policy Center and the Center for American Progress, and serves on \u201ca few nonprofit and for-profit boards,\u201d while also traveling around the country as a speaker.\n\nAbout the ACA \u2013 aka \u201cObamacare\u201d \u2013 we asked his view on how it\u2019s being received. \u201cThere\u2019s an enormous amount of misunderstanding, and I\u2019m very disappointed that\u2019s the case \u2013 the most misunderstood is the role of government in this whole effort \u2026 This is probably our last hope in putting together an infrastructure for health that takes all of the good things that are happening in the private sector (and) tries to create more of an efficient organization entity than we have today. \u2026 I\u2019ve always said, America is the only industrialized country that doesn\u2019t have a health SYSTEM \u2013 (it has a) marketplace that\u2019s a collage of subsystems that \u2026 don\u2019t work very well together \u2026 and unfortunately we pay a high price for the fact they don\u2019t. \u2026 People don\u2019t realize that (under the new system) they will never have to worry about getting dropped or excluded or denied insurance \u2026\u201d\n\nThen the conversation comes back around to Saturday\u2019s gala \u2013 come hear what he has to say about Southwest Youth and Family Services, his brother Steve, and the future. And maybe health care, too.
