Inspired by her experience, Rogers said her goal now is to improve health care access for fishermen. A medical student at Tufts University School of Medicine in the Maine Track program at Maine Medical Center, she\u2019s teaming up with the hospital to try to set up a mobile health care clinic on the Portland waterfront, probably in a van or RV.\n\nAdditional Images John Patriquin/Staff Photographer Tufts medical student Miranda Rogers and Dr. Tania Strout of Maine Medical Center are working on a survey to assess the health needs of Maine\u2019s fishermen, with the goal of setting up a waterfront mobile clinic.

More than 7,300 commercial fishermen work in Maine, and hundreds are based on the Portland waterfront.\n\nRogers, 28, said realizing the goal is a few years away, but she will start this summer with a survey to determine the health needs of lobstermen. Once established, Rogers said, she hopes the clinic will become self-sustaining and continue to operate after she finishes school.\n\nRogers said simply making health care more convenient for fishermen is an important step.\n\n\u201cI know that there are so many missed appointments because when the weather\u2019s nice, the lobstermen will cancel their doctor\u2019s appointments to go out on the water,\u201d Rogers said. \u201cIf it\u2019s a good day for fishing, you have to go.\u201d\n\nBasic health care needs often go unmet, Rogers said, and some physicians are not aware of the kinds of health issues more common in fishermen than the general population.\n\n\u201cIf you know what the common problems are, you can be prepared for them,\u201d Rogers said.\n\nAfter the survey is completed, Rogers said, she\u2019s looking to build the resources and network needed to set up the mobile clinic on the waterfront. It could be staffed with hundreds of volunteers working rotating shifts, mostly medical students from Tufts and the University of New England and nursing students from the University of Southern Maine. She also is hoping to recruit professionals from Maine Med and elsewhere who would be willing to volunteer for shifts.\n\nDr. Tania Strout, research director at Maine Med\u2019s emergency medicine department and Rogers\u2019 Tufts program mentor, said the clinic is a realistic goal.\n\n\u201cThis project has a chance to have a significant impact. I love it when these things are meaningful,\u201d Strout said. \u201cThis definitely passes the \u2018who cares\u2019 test.\u201d\n\nStrout said they will pursue grants to help with fixed costs, such as equipment and medical supplies.\n\nRogers said she envisions volunteers at the mobile clinic helping fishermen \u2013 many of whom don\u2019t have health insurance \u2013 sign up for insurance through the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAn outreach program through the Maine Lobstermen\u2019s Association attempted to sign up lobstermen for insurance through the federal law, but the association doesn\u2019t yet know how many did so, according to Patrice McCarron, executive director of the association. About 44,000 Mainers signed up for insurance through the federal law.\n\n\u201cThe call volume was overwhelming, and we do know there were a lot of success stories,\u201d McCarron said. Still, McCarron said, she suspects the second year will be more successful than the first, as word spreads about affordable plans. Although there are no recent statistics, prior to the Affordable Care Act becoming law, it was estimated more than one-third of Maine lobstermen did not have health insurance, and many of those who did had only catastrophic coverage.\n\nAs for a mobile clinic, similar models have worked in the midcoast and Downeast regions to bring care to the fishing community, McCarron said. The Maine Sea Coast Mission brings a boat to various islands along the Maine coast to provide basic health care.\n\nAn annual conference also gives fishermen access to some health care. Chilloa Young, coordinator of the annual Maine Fishermen\u2019s Forum held every winter in Rockland, said University of Southern Maine nursing students have helped with preventive screenings for 15 years. Recently, the forum has added skin cancer detection and hearing tests. Loud engines on fishing boats can cause hearing problems, and being out in the sun all day increases the likelihood of contracting skin cancer.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t charge any money, and I know this service is very valuable for the fishermen,\u201d Young said.\n\nBut the Portland clinic wouldn\u2019t solve one common problem: the smell of fish bait.\n\n\u201cYou can shower three times and you\u2019re still not getting the smell off of you,\u201d Rogers said, laughing.\n\nThose interested in the survey and potential clinic can call 662-7049 or email Rogers at [email protected]\n\nJoe Lawlor can be contacted at 791-6376 or at:\n\n[email protected]\n\nTwitter: @joelawlorph", "article_metadata": {"description": "A mobile clinic would address hearing, sun damage and other health problems common among fishermen.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "description": "A mobile clinic would address hearing, sun damage and other health problems common among fishermen.", "title": "Medical student wants to bring basic medical care to Portland waterfront - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 999, "identifier": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/469965-20140603_LobsterStud.jpg", "height": 574}, "updated_time": "2014-06-04T01:44:59-04:00", "url": "http://www.pressherald.com/2014/06/04/medical-student-want-to-bring-basic-medical-care-to-portland-waterfront/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A mobile clinic would address hearing, sun damage and other health problems common among fishermen.", "creator": "@pressherald", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/469965-20140603_LobsterStud.jpg", "title": "Medical student wants to bring basic medical care to Portland waterfront - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "site": "@pressherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=951845858", "fb": {"admins": 769488179, "app_id": 178078215650057}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressherald", "section": "Business", "published_time": "2014-06-04T00:01:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-04T01:44:59-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "QWs9pxQP8fwo2-nR5mWopc6qCK2D3920f7bl-U-zkso", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc591\"", "article_summary": "The Maine Sea Coast Mission brings a boat to various islands along the Maine coast to provide basic health care.\nA medical student at Tufts University School of Medicine in the Maine Track program at Maine Medical Center, she\u2019s teaming up with the hospital to try to set up a mobile health care clinic on the Portland waterfront, probably in a van or RV.\nInspired by her experience, Rogers said her goal now is to improve health care access for fishermen.\nAs for a mobile clinic, similar models have worked in the midcoast and Downeast regions to bring care to the fishing community, McCarron said.\nSearch photos available for purchase: Photo Store \u2192If it becomes a reality, the clinic would offer drop-in screenings and basic health care to fishermen coming off the boats."}
