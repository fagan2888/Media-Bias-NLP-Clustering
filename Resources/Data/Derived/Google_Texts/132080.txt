A suspect throwing bricks at a police car and precinct substation died in an officer-involved shooting in Phoenix late Saturday morning.

It happened in the area of 39th Avenue and Cactus Road just before noon.

An officer was leaving the precinct when the man threw a rock or brick at his patrol car.

While the officer was calling dispatch, the man threw additional bricks, breaking a precinct door, police said.

Officers in the building managed to leave and approach the man.

The suspect then threw a large rock or brick at one of the officers. It glanced off a tree and hit the officer in the hand.

The officer fired, striking the suspect. The officer suffered a slight hand injury.

The suspect was taken to the hospital in critical condition and later died.

A resident in the area said a man came by and took bricks from his wall. The resident said he later heard gunshots coming from the Cactus Park Precinct.

"I think when you look at the damage to both the patrol car and the glass at the precinct, you'll see that this man was intent on doing some harm this morning," Sgt. Jonathan Howard said.

The station will be closed until further notice.

Saturday's incident was the 38th recorded police shooting in Phoenix this year.
