Oklahoma voters can now request an absentee ballot online.

Oklahoma State Election Board launched a new system Wednesday to make voting by mail more convenient.

The new online system is secure, and voters who can't make it to the polls in person will still receive their ballot by mail - usually about a month before the election.

Any registered voter can vote by mail and never miss an election. You still have to have your ballot notarized then mailed in by the deadline.

You can even track your absentee ballot using the Oklahoma State Election Board's Online Voter Tool.

The deadline to apply for an absentee ballot for the March 1 presidential primary is 5 p.m. February 24. Voters can still request an absentee ballot by mail.
