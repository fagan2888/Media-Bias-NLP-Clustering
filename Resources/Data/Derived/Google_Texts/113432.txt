Eric Decker spent four years in Denver — two with Peyton Manning as his quarterback — and quickly became one of the team’s most beloved players. In all, he recorded 3,071 yards from scrimmage with 33 receiving touchdowns as a Bronco before signing with the Jets as a free agent this past summer.

In his place, the Broncos signed former Steeler Emmanuel Sanders, who has since thrived as one of Manning’s top targets, averaging career highs in yards per reception (14.2), receptions per game (6.7) and touchdowns (7).

The Broncos may be struggling as of late, but the Jets are 2-8 and have been riddled with injuries, quarterback issues and, as usual, a slew of negative headlines this season.

In October, ahead of his first meeting with the Broncos as a Jet, Decker said he expected a “weird” reunion while hinting that his departure was bittersweet. The Broncos won that game, 31-17, while the Jets went on to lose another three straight before getting a win over Pittsburgh on Nov. 9.

Ahead of the Jets’ rescheduled matchup with the Bills in Detroit, Decker spoke to the New York Daily News and offered some revealing comments about what it’s like to watch his old team.
