This year\u2019s theme is \u201cEngaging Youth Voices in the Response to HIV & AIDS.\u201d We at AIDS.gov hope you will use these digital resources for #NYHAAD and beyond to engage with youth about HIV.\n\nDigital Storytelling: AIDS.gov recently released Positive Spin. This digital storytelling series features the personal experiences of five HIV-positive, gay black men who have successfully navigated the HIV care continuum, from diagnosis to treatment and, ultimately, to viral suppression. Achieving viral suppression helps those with HIV stay healthy, live longer, and dramatically reduce their chances of passing the virus to others.\n\nAmong these Positive Spin stories are: Uriah\u2019s story of learning at age 17 that he is HIV-positive and Guy\u2019s story of being a young, black gay man living with HIV. Watch their stories, share them on social media using #mypositivespin, and leave us your comments.\n\nLearn the Facts:\n\nListen and Join the Conversation:\n\nTake Action:\n\nHow do you use social media to take part in the conversation about HIV?
