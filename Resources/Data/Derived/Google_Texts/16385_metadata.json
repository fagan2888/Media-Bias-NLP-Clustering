There was no COLA in 2010 or 2011, thanks to the government index used to determine whether an \u201cadjustment\u201d (increase) was justified, to offset inflation. This year\u2019s culprit was the price of gasoline, which fell 23 percent, wiping out any chance for an increase in the checks going to more than 60 million recipients.\n\nHeroic and often invisible measures have been undertaken in recent years to cover up the program\u2019s insolvency: raising retirement ages, increasing deductibles and co-pays in Social Security\u2019s Medicare program, and forcing recipients to make do with less.\n\nAccording to the Senior Citizens League, those recipients have lost nearly a fourth of their buying power over the last 15 years, thanks to the rising cost of housing and medical expenses. Since 2000, housing costs for seniors have increased by 44 percent, heating oil by 159 percent, eggs by 117 percent, and gasoline by 76 percent. Since then, however, Social Security\u2019s COLAs have averaged just 2.2 percent per year.\n\nIn 1972, Congress modified Social Security so that it would reflect the loss of purchasing power of the dollar, resulting in the adoption of the Consumer Price Index, or CPI. At the time the index measured the price increases (as a result of the inflation caused by the Federal Reserve) of a market basket of goods and services bought by wage earners.\n\nThen in 1987, Congress, responding to pressure from constituents that the CPI didn\u2019t reflect the real cost of living of elderly people receiving checks, directed the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) to develop an alternate CPI for the elderly, called CPI-E. The BLS has been \u201cdeveloping\u201d that alternate ever since. It remains under study today with little chance of its adoption any time soon. The BLS has said, however, that since retirees 65 and older spend more than twice as much on healthcare, and those 75 and older spend nearly three times more on healthcare than do wage earners, a COLA based upon the theoretical/experimental CPI-E would have raised the annual increases by at least 0.2 percent year.\n\nThat\u2019s the very last thing supporters of the system want. They prefer to claim, as does the New York Times\u2019 favorite establishment economist, Paul Krugman, that \u201cSocial Security does not face a financial crisis; its long term funding shortfall could easily be closed with modest increases in revenue.\u201d\n\nThere are numerous problems with the system, but the primary one is the continued unwillingness by statist apologists such as Krugman to recognize the reality that it\u2019s a government-mandated, forced extraction of monies from wages before the wage earner ever sees his paycheck. Forcing people to pay into the system is the immoral basis upon which the entire edifice stands.\n\nIt hides behind such terms as \u201cinsurance\u201d (as in Federal Insurance Contributions Act, or FICA) and \u201ctrust fund\u201d (as in Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund), neither of which describe the plan. The reference to \u201cinsurance\u201d is flawed, as beneficiaries have no enforceable right to the funds in their \u201caccount,\" identified by their Social Security number. And the so-called \u201ctrust fund\u201d is filled with government IOUs, reflecting the fact that the monies collected by force by the government have already been spent by the government.\n\nSocial Security was never designed to be insurance, with reserves backed by securities (as is the case with private insurance companies), but is merely another tax to fund the government in exchange for promises that could (and would) be broken at any time. As the Republican Party\u2019s platform for the 1936 presidential election stated,\n\nThe so-called reserve fund \u2026 is no reserve at all, because the fund will contain nothing but the Government\u2019s promises to pay, while the taxes collected in the guise of premiums will be wasted by the Government in reckless and extravagant political schemes.\n\nThe program drew heavily from the machinations of one Charles Ponzi, who promised his investors a 50-percent profit within 45 days, or a 100-percent profit within 90 days, by performing an arbitrage between discounted postal reply coupons in other countries and redeeming them at face value in the United States. Of course, there was no arbitrage of any kind \u2014 just a swindle: Early investors were paid off with the contributions of later investors. Before it ended, those \u201cinvestors\u201d lost $20 million in 1920 dollars. Today? About a quarter of a trillion dollars.\n\nPonzi's scheme failed when the flow of new investors into the scheme slowed down, just as is happening currently with Social Security. The New York Times quoted Stephen Goss, the program\u2019s chief actuary, who said that the scheme\u2019s most significant issue \u201cis that fewer workers are paying taxes into the program \u2026 while more retirees are collecting their checks.\u201d In fact, that $20 million that Ponzi swindled from his \u201cinvestors\u201d is pocket change compared to the scam now unfolding, and increasingly coming to those beneficiaries\u2019 attention. When Boston University Professor Laurence Kotlikoff looked behind the numbers, he discovered the size of the deception:\n\nSocial Security\u2019s 2015 Trustees Report came out just last month [July, 2015]. It shows, in table VI F1 (which is deeply buried in the Report\u2019s appendix), that the system has a $25.8 trillion fiscal gap\u2026.\n\nThe $25.8 trillion fiscal gap \u2026 takes into account all future benefit outlays [promises] and all future taxes [extractions]\u2026.\n\nWhat does Social Security\u2019s $25.8 trillion fiscal gap, which is far larger than our economy\u2019s $18 trillion annual GDP, mean, exactly? It means that \u2026 [to be solvent] it requires a 32 percent immediate and permanent hike in Social Security\u2019s 12.4 percent FICA tax.\n\nFar be it from this humble scribe to suggest that Kotlikoff is wrong in his numbers, but it is undeniably true that he is wrong in his assumption that Social Security can be saved and become solvent. A system based on theft and fraud cannot be saved. It must be terminated immediately \u2014 a suggestion strangely missing from public debate, especially by Republican Party candidates such as New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, and Senator Marco Rubio, all three of whom think the scheme can be saved. Suggestions by Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders and former Maryland Governor Martin O\u2019Malley that taxes be raised on the rich also fall short of the mark: The rich just aren\u2019t that rich to fund the swindle\u2019s staggering shortfall.\n\nA graduate of an Ivy League school and a former investment advisor, Bob is a regular contributor to The New American magazine and blogs frequently at www.LightFromTheRight.com, primarily on economics and politics.
