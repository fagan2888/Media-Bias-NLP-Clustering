Griffin was in Norman last night for Oklahoma's game against Baylor. Griffin's No. 23 jersey was retired in an emotional ceremony in front of his family and a sold-out crowd.\n\nBlake's jersey 23 re-retired after Tiz before him. @OU_MBBall @news9 pic.twitter.com/R4JVbMrftj \u2014 Dean Blevins (@DeanBlevins) March 2, 2016\n\nNo. 2?3? and 2?4? pic.twitter.com/gRv2XwHXIR \u2014 Oklahoma Basketball (@OU_MBBall) March 2, 2016\n\nLos Angeles has actually played quite well without Griffin, partly thanks to improvement from the wing positions. The Clippers are 26-7 over their past 33 games and will have a mighty different look since the last time these two teams tangled back on Dec. 21. Long gone are Lance Stephenson and Josh Smith as Los Angeles cut bait on those experiments. In their place is former Thunder forward Jeff Green, whom the Clips acquired from Memphis prior to the deadline.\n\nThe Thunder (42-18) is coming off of a 131-116 scorching of the Kings on Monday night. Another Russell Westbrook triple double helped Oklahoma City avoid its fifth loss in six games. It's a good thing they won it, too, because now starts one of the hardest back-to-backs imaginable.\n\nLos Angeles is just two games back of OKC in the loss column and knows that a win on Wednesday could help matters immensely. But the Thunder can't use up all of their gas on Wednesday because 24 hours later they have another date with the NBA's new overlords, the Warriors.\n\nTip time from Staples Center isn't until 9:30 p.m. CDT. Sleep is overrated, anyway.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "After just one meeting thus far this season, the Thunder and Clippers are about to get mighty cozy.", "author": "Kevin Kuzminski", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/31363584/thunder-vs-clippers-preview-los-angeles-creeping-closer", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/10008563_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "After just one meeting thus far this season, the Thunder and Clippers are about to get mighty cozy.", "title": "Thunder vs. Clippers Preview: Los Angeles Creeping Closer"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/10008563_G.jpg", "description": "After just one meeting thus far this season, the Thunder and Clippers are about to get mighty cozy.", "card": "summary", "title": "Thunder vs. Clippers Preview: Los Angeles Creeping Closer"}, "wnreadableurl": "thunder-vs-clippers-preview-los-angeles-creeping-closer", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KWTV", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "date": "2016/03/02", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,newsok,channel 9,channel nine,news 9,television,this morning,live radar,kwtv,sports,video,live streaming,interactive", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS26", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,newsok,channel 9,channel nine,news 9,television,this morning,live radar,kwtv,sports,video,live streaming,interactive"}, "article_summary": "After just one meeting thus far this season, the Thunder and Clippers are about to get mighty cozy.\npic.twitter.com/gRv2XwHXIR \u2014 Oklahoma Basketball (@OU_MBBall) March 2, 2016Los Angeles has actually played quite well without Griffin, partly thanks to improvement from the wing positions.\nThe Clippers (39-20) are still without Blake Griffin as he continues to heal his broken hand.\nLos Angeles is just two games back of OKC in the loss column and knows that a win on Wednesday could help matters immensely.\nIn their place is former Thunder forward Jeff Green, whom the Clips acquired from Memphis prior to the deadline."}
