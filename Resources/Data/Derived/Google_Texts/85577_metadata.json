Bernard Sanders, Mrs. Clinton has placed women\u2019s rights at the forefront of her candidacy, rallying with a heightened sense of absolutism: fighting against all restrictions on abortions, including during the ninth month of pregnancy.\n\nShe regularly rails against Republican efforts to strip taxpayer funding from Planned Parenthood and was rewarded this month when the group\u2019s political arm endorsed her presidential bid \u2014 marking the first time the abortion provider has tipped its hand in the presidential primary in its 100-year history.\n\nJust days after the endorsement, Mrs. Clinton called for the repeal of the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits direct federal taxpayer funding for abortions.\n\nMr. Sanders, speaking to MSNBC\u2019s Rachel Maddow, waved off the endorsement as another sign of \u201cthe political establishment\u201d rallying to Mrs. Clinton. That drew outraged responses from Mrs. Clinton\u2019s defenders, including her husband, former President Bill Clinton, who said it was demeaning to Planned Parenthood.\n\nBut analysts said Mr. Sanders had a point.\n\n\u201cBernie Sanders is exactly right,\u201d said Chad Pecknold, a theologian at Catholic University of America. \u201cHillary Clinton has always been a part of the establishment and one of the most powerful players in politics \u2014 of which she\u2019s been 100 percent bought and paid for \u2014 is Planned Parenthood. She can\u2019t do anything but support the vision of the group.\u201d\n\nPlanned Parenthood fights all restrictions on abortions and has been particularly vocal in opposing efforts to ban late-term abortions. Yet those bans are popular with the public, according to a Marist poll released last week. More than 60 percent of respondents said they supported outlawing abortion after 20 weeks, or about five months, into a pregnancy.\n\nIn 2000, when she first ran for the U.S. Senate, Mrs. Clinton seemed to be part of that majority, telling The Associated Press that she \u201cwould support legislation that would ban late-term abortions, including so-called partial-birth abortion, as long as it protects the life and health of the woman and it does not undermine Roe v. Wade.\u201d\n\nBy this year\u2019s presidential campaign, though, her stance had hardened.\n\n\u201cI think that the kind of late-term abortions that take place are because of medical necessity, and therefore I would hate to see the government interfering with that decision,\u201d she said in a September interview with John Dickerson of CBS. \u201cThis gets back to whether you respect a woman\u2019s right to choose or not, and I think that\u2019s what this whole argument is about.\u201d\n\nSeveral states have enacted 20-week bans in recent years, and the U.S. House passed a similar measure in May, though Senate Democrats successfully filibustered to stop the legislation from reaching President Obama\u2019s desk.\n\nMrs. Clinton tweeted in May regarding the measure, \u201cWhen it comes to women\u2019s health, there are two kinds of experts: women and doctors. True 40+ years ago, true today.\u201d\n\nAt a campaign event in August, she compared Republican presidential candidates\u2019 views on women\u2019s rights, including the approval of bans on late-term abortions, to that of terrorists.\n\n\u201cNow, extreme views about women, we expect that from some of the terrorist groups, we expect that from people who don\u2019t want to live in the modern world, but it\u2019s a little hard to take from Republicans who want to be president of the United States,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said.\n\nShe made the comments after the release of undercover videos in July, shot by a pro-life advocacy group, showing Planned Parenthood executives drinking wine while negotiating prices of aborted baby parts for research purposes. Although the videos were edited, several Republican lawmakers called for the subsequent defunding of Planned Parenthood and a congressional investigation into the organization.\n\nAfter a protracted fight, the House this month passed a measure that would have gutted federal funding for Planned Parenthood and repealed parts of the Affordable Care Act, which the president vetoed.\n\nWhen the videos were first released, however, Mrs. Clinton called them \u201cdisturbing.\u201d But within the span of 48 hours, she started vigorously defending the nation\u2019s largest abortion provider.\n\n\u201cI have seen pictures from them and obviously find them disturbing,\u201d Mrs. Clinton told the New Hampshire Union Leader the Tuesday after the videos were made public.\n\nTwo days later, she took to her Twitter account to defend the organization.\n\n\u201cProud to stand [with] Planned Parenthood and for access to quality, affordable healthcare for women, men & young people,\u201d she said.\n\nThose who have studied the long-standing relationship between Mrs. Clinton and Planned Parenthood say the about-face was expected.\n\n\u201cBoth Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton are as far left on abortion as you can possibly get \u2014 they\u2019re both right in line with Planned Parenthood\u2019s reasoning that abortion should be legal for any reason, at any time and should all be paid for by the taxpayer,\u201d said Penny Young Nance, president of Concerned Women for America. \u201cThe only difference between Bernie and Hillary is Hillary is part of the political establishment and Planned Parenthood is the abortion political machine. I think it\u2019s humorous they would suggest otherwise.\u201d\n\nEven though Planned Parenthood only recently endorsed Mrs. Clinton for president, the partnership has been building for some time.\n\nAs Mrs. Clinton launched her bid for the White House last spring, Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards tweeted: \u201cthere has never been a presidential candidate with as strong a commitment to women\u2019s health & rights,\u201d and called the moment \u201c#Historic.\u201d\n\nMrs. Richards\u2019 daughter, Lily Adams, is Mrs. Clinton\u2019s Iowa press secretary.\n\nPlanned Parenthood\u2019s political arm has said it will spend at least $20 million this election cycle to back its favored candidates.\n\nPlanned Parenthood also has taken an active role within the Clinton Foundation as a member of the Clinton Global Initiative. It has teamed with the foundation to train \u201cyouth peer providers\u201d in Latin American, Africa and the U.S. in ways to promote birth control, according to the Clinton Global Initiative\u2019s website.\n\nPlanned Parenthood is also sponsoring two global youth fellowship programs and will participate with the Clinton Global Initiative to create a national youth organizing strategy to advocate for more investment and access to reproductive health care.\n\nMr. Sanders\u2019 campaign stood by his contention that Planned Parenthood is part of the Clinton political establishment.\n\n\u201cI think Bernie is referring to, we are seeing it not just in those organizations but others, a lot of national groups with headquarters here in Washington, and the leadership, the headquarters, has one agenda. And I think the people in the states and the grass roots have another,\u201d Ted Devine, Mr. Sanders\u2019 head strategist, told NBC\u2019s Andrea Mitchell.\n\nSo far this election cycle, employees within the \u201cwomen\u2019s issues\u201d industry have given $2.5 million to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign, making the group her sixth-largest donor, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics.\n\nThe Planned Parenthood Action Fund, the group\u2019s federal political action committee, gave $8,000 to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s Senate 2000 campaign and $1,837 to her 2008 presidential bid, records show. Many of Planned Parenthood\u2019s PAC donors are the biggest givers to the Ready for Hillary PAC, a pro-Clinton organization, and have personally maxed out to her campaign with individual contributions of $2,700.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Once a proponent of making abortions \"safe, legal and rare,\" Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton has now dropped the \"rare\" from her rhetorical pitch as she seeks to rally the Planned Parenthood vote.", "Author": "Kelly Riddell", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Once a proponent of making abortions \u201csafe, legal and rare,\u201d Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton has now dropped the \u201crare\u201d from her rhetorical pitch as she seeks to rally the Planned Parenthood vote.", "title": "Hillary Clinton rallies Planned Parenthood vote, fights all restrictions on abortions", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jan/24/hillary-clinton-rallies-planned-parenthood-vote-fi/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/01/24/HillaryClinton.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/01/24/HillaryClinton.jpg", "title": "Hillary Clinton rallies Planned Parenthood vote, fights all restrictio", "description": "Once a proponent of making abortions \"safe, legal and rare,\" Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton has now dropped the \"rare\" from her rhetorical pitch as she seeks to rally the Planned Pare", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Politics, Planned Parenthood, Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe only difference between Bernie and Hillary is Hillary is part of the political establishment and Planned Parenthood is the abortion political machine.\nThose who have studied the long-standing relationship between Mrs. Clinton and Planned Parenthood say the about-face was expected.\nPlanned Parenthood also has taken an active role within the Clinton Foundation as a member of the Clinton Global Initiative.\n\u201cProud to stand [with] Planned Parenthood and for access to quality, affordable healthcare for women, men & young people,\u201d she said.\nMr. Sanders\u2019 campaign stood by his contention that Planned Parenthood is part of the Clinton political establishment."}
