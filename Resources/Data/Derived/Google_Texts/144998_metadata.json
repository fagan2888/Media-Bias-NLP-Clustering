The reforms were slated to be included in the $1.1 trillion spending bill given final approval Thursday by the Senate.\n\nMost Democratic and Republican leaders on Capitol Hill last year signed off on putting the landmark reforms in the continuing resolution, which typically was so massive that most legislators had not read it nor were fully aware of all that was or was not included.\n\nBut at the last minute in drafting the bill, House Republican negotiators withheld their support for the IMF reforms in a standoff with the White House over budget provisions apparently unrelated to the IMF. Analysts said that effectively killed the best chance of getting the legislation through Congress anytime soon.\n\nThe setback for the Obama administration is likely to have ugly repercussions for the United States, international analysts said. Much of the rest of the world has been waiting for three years for Washington to put the reforms into motion.\n\n\u201cThis is a major blow to U.S. credibility around the world, with ominous consequences\u201d for U.S. efforts to lead the world on economic and financial matters, said Edwin M. Truman, an analyst at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. He called Congress\u2018 failure to act a \u201cself-inflicted wound\u201d that will hinder the ability of the U.S. to lead at the IMF and other global forums.\n\n\u201cThe United States will be less trusted to implement international agreements in this and other areas. Moreover, the IMF is weakened\u201d in a way that will make it harder for the U.S. and other Western nations to influence China and other emerging nations on market-oriented policies.\n\nTreasury Secretary Jack Lew, who made the IMF package a top priority, was met with skepticism last month when he appealed for the reforms at a House Financial Services Committee hearing.\n\n\u201cMany Americans question the wisdom of supporting the IMF and other multilateral financial institutions that take their hard-earned dollars and use them to bail out other countries,\u201d committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling, Texas Republican, told the Treasury secretary.\n\nMr. Hensarling said he had doubts about the U.S. ability to carry out the reforms because of President Obama\u2019s diminished clout abroad.\n\n\u201cAn important question is whether the administration\u2019s credibility has been compromised and has compromised our ability to reform multilateral financial institutions,\u201d Mr. Hensarling said.\n\nThe administration can try again this year to secure approval in Congress, but analysts are not optimistic that opportunities will arise.\n\nMr. Lew, addressing the Council on Foreign Relations late last week, said the White House \u201cmade a full-court press to get it done and got close, but didn\u2019t get it done this past week. We are continuing to stand by our commitment, and we will get it done.\u201d\n\nMr. Truman blamed the failure to act on Congress and the administration, saying neither has given enough priority to updating the World War II-era financial institutions that have helped maintain global financial stability for decades, most recently by helping to quell the monumental debt crisis in Europe.\n\n\u201cThe failure of the Obama administration and U.S. Congress to exercise leadership on this issue was likely driven by a lethal combination of antipathy, apathy or ignorance,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it means that other countries may now start turning further away\u201d from the U.S. on vital economic and financial matters.\n\nChina goes it alone?\n\nAnalysts said the long delay in U.S. approval of what amounts to a modest and incremental modernization of the IMF will only encourage China and other major emerging powers to go it alone or create alternative international forums to exercise their growing economic clout. China already extends more loans each year to developing nations in Africa, Latin America and Asia than does the World Bank, the IMF\u2019s sister institution.\n\nChina also has suggested marshaling the sizable resources of major emerging economic powers to create an alternative lending fund, which could compete with the U.S.-dominated IMF in providing emergency lending to nations in economic straits. Such an alternative lending authority could enable China and other economic powers that are less market-oriented to exert potentially enormous influence over smaller nations in times of crisis, placing them firmly in a China-centered orbit outside the influence of the U.S. and other Western powers.\n\nRepublican leaders with jurisdiction over the IMF were prepared to agree to the reforms in the spending package, but they wanted the White House to make concessions, the analysts said. When the administration failed to so, the Republicans pointed to lingering opposition to the IMF among conservative populists, some of whom oppose any more funding or authority for the Bretton Woods institution.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no small matter,\u201d House Appropriations Committee Chairman Harold Rogers, Kentucky Republican, told reporters about the IMF funding request. The administration was seeking to \u201creprogram\u201d $63 billion in emergency lending authority that the U.S. gave the IMF during the global financial crisis. Congress approved the lending authority in 2009, but the IMF reforms required the U.S. contribution to be shifted to a permanent fund for any other global financial emergencies.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge monetary item, fiscally \u2014 $63 billion,\u201d Mr. Rogers said, though supporters argued that the measure would have a relatively small impact of $314 million in the budget over the short term.\n\nUnder the reforms, most of a proposed doubling of IMF lending authority to $733 billion would be underwritten by other nations, including China, which in return would receive a modest increase in its voting power in IMF decisions, an increase that still falls far short of reflecting Beijing\u2019s real-world economic clout.\n\nU.S. still dominates IMF\n\nBeyond that, U.S. supporters of the reforms said the changes would do nothing to dilute the substantial voting power of Washington on the IMF\u2019s executive board, and would maintain the effective U.S. veto authority over IMF activities. Even if nearly every other country approves the reforms, U.S. inaction or opposition would effectively kill them.\n\nWhile the 17 percent voting share for the U.S. would not be affected, small European countries such as Belgium would have to accommodate the increased share for emerging economic powers. China\u2019s voting clout would almost double to about 6 percent, making it the third-largest voice in IMF votes.\n\n\u201cIt is pretty big slap in the face of the IMF by the U.S. at a time when the U.S. is trying to re-establish its leadership in these global organizations,\u201d Douglas A. Rediker, U.S. representative on the IMF board from 2010 to 2012, told the Peterson Institute.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. reluctance to move ahead with this is causing some friction\u201d at meetings of the Group of 20 economic powers, which includes China, India and other major emerging nations as well as European allies who reluctantly made substantial concessions by agreeing to the reforms, he said.\n\nOfficials in India, China and South Korea were among those expressing disappointment at the U.S. failure to endorse the IMF overhaul last week.\n\nU.S. inaction undermines efforts to modernize and beef up the IMF so it can deal with the increasingly large-scale financial crises that have caused global economic turmoil in recent years, he said.\n\nMoreover, with the administration in the midst of negotiations with the European Union and a host of other nations in the Asia-Pacific region over potentially far-reaching trade agreements, \u201cIt is probably a pretty decent slap at President Obama\u2019s ability to go ahead with commitments\u201d like those, he said.\n\nIMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde, who has visited key members of Congress in an effort to prod action, said she remains hopeful. \u201cWe understand that the U.S. administration will continue to work on securing the necessary legislative authorization and we are hopeful that this will happen,\u201d she said in a statement after the budget details were released last week.\n\nShe noted that the IMF, since the 2008 global financial crisis, has made 154 lending commitments around the world and provided technical assistance to 90 percent of its members.\n\n\u201cWe have certainly played our part in the collective response to the crisis,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Though many legislators may not realize it, Congress failed to include in the massive spending deal approved last week funds to implement reforms sought for years by both Democratic and Republican presidents that would give China, India, Brazil and other large emerging nations a greater say in activities of the International Monetary Fund.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Though many legislators may not realize it, Congress failed to include in the massive spending deal approved last week funds to implement reforms sought for years by both Democratic and Republican presidents that would give China, India, Brazil and other large emerging nations a greater say in activities of the International Monetary Fund.", "title": "Congress inaction could cost U.S. clout at IMF", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jan/20/congress-inaction-could-cost-us-clout-at-imf/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/01/20/1_202014_obama-budget-lew-28201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/01/20/1_202014_obama-budget-lew-28201.jpg", "description": "Though many legislators may not realize it, Congress failed to include in the massive spending deal approved last week funds to implement reforms sought for years by both Democratic and Republican pre", "card": "summary", "title": "Congress inaction could cost U.S. clout at IMF"}, "Author": "Patrice Hill", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Business Finance, Politics, International Monetary Fund, Congress, China"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd980a\"", "article_summary": "But at the last minute in drafting the bill, House Republican negotiators withheld their support for the IMF reforms in a standoff with the White House over budget provisions apparently unrelated to the IMF.\nCongress approved the lending authority in 2009, but the IMF reforms required the U.S. contribution to be shifted to a permanent fund for any other global financial emergencies.\nIMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde, who has visited key members of Congress in an effort to prod action, said she remains hopeful.\nThe administration was seeking to \u201creprogram\u201d $63 billion in emergency lending authority that the U.S. gave the IMF during the global financial crisis.\nHe called Congress\u2018 failure to act a \u201cself-inflicted wound\u201d that will hinder the ability of the U.S. to lead at the IMF and other global forums."}
