STARKVILLE, Miss. (WCBI)- Mississippi State University had its International culture on display during its 26th annual international Fiesta.

Over 27 nations were represented to promote the diversity on MSU’s campus.

“The vibe out here is just very calming, it’s very peaceful, I see a lot of happiness going on,”said MSU student Issac Lies.

“I think this event gives you an opportunity to spread love,” said K.M. Asif, member of the MSU Bangledesh Student Association.

Asif has attended the event for the past three years, and said it’s the friendships that he forms here that keeps him coming back.

“It gives a bond and it also gives an opportunity form a bond with a lot of people that sometimes we see in a stereotypical way so this breaks those bonds,” said Asif.

And the making of those bonds came through one thing, food.

Vendors set up booths and cooked some of their well know cuisines, and other popular food items from their country for everyone to come by and try.

“It’s kind of like a melting pot, it’s like a heaven for food loving people,” said Asif.

“There is culture inside the food, just the different spices and sauces and you definitely tell,” said MSU student Richard Hope.

Now besides the food, patrons also rave about the diversity this event helps bring out.

“I’ve seen more people here on this day than actually just going to class,” said Hope.

“It’s so needed,” said MSU student Debra Addyeye. “I feel like a lot of times we can forget that there are so many people here on our campus, but like for people to come out here and be like, that looks weird but i’ll try it, I think that’s really cool and it’s definitely a conversation starter.”

So no matter the race, religion or country you are apart of, this was a time when everyone came together as a whole.

When asked about the event, vendors and students said one word comes to mind.

“Blissful,” said Lies.

“Awesome,” said Asif.

“Fun,” said Addyeye.
