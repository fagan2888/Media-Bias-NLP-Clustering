Explaining how growing up in America she often visited her family\u2019s home in India, she recalls her early connection to the sensuality of ritual but also her fear and doubt and the resulting sense of alienation.\n\nThis back story should not surprise anyone who has watched Ms. Srinivasan dance. She is among the most openly sensual \u2014 and least inhibited \u2014 dancers I have ever seen. In \u201cNight,\u201d the central solo of \u201cTejas,\u201d which she presented at the Robert Moss Theater on Saturday as part of the New York International Fringe Festival, her character searches in a storm for her lover, the god Krishna. Eventually she finds him with another woman. But before that rude surprise, visions of the divine make her hands quake with an erotic rapture that\u2019s nearly frightening.\n\nThe solo is gripping in its toggling between dread and desire. Ms. Srinivasan\u2019s sweet face is incredibly expressive. She inhabits her character with such absolute focus as to compel empathy; her experience becomes the viewer\u2019s. But the drama arises as much from her choreography as from her acting. Her movements conjure the storms both outside and within. The anger of a woman scorned is expressed as much in her tightening circles of rhythmic steps as in her fierce gestures and scowling.\n\n\u201cNight\u201d is the hot core of a show organized by time of day, with seven sections passing from afternoon through to the following midmorning. Besides \u201cNight,\u201d the strongest sections are \u201cDusk\u201d and \u201cEvening,\u201d in which intriguing part-Western music by the Finnish composer Ilari Kaila leads Ms. Srinivasan into experimentation, incorporating Western dance forms. In \u201cEvening\u201d the force of shuttling eyes or shoulder blades like cocking shotguns, isolated as percussive abstractions, works well with the spatial tension in the arrangement of three dancers.\n\nThe yoga in \u201cDawn\u201d is less compelling, and the first and final group sections, though handsome and diverting in their shifting formations, are lighter and more conventional: an opening number and (redundantly) two closing ones. The five dancers other than Ms. Srinivasan share her endearing enthusiasm, though that\u2019s the positive side of varying degrees of amateurishness that sap her designs of some of their potential power.\n\nAs the diurnal cycle completed, I found myself longing for a different story. At the end of \u201cDusk,\u201d Ms. Srinivasan is the last to leave. It\u2019s clear, on her face and in how her exiting body twists back, that something has happened to her alone. That individual experience continues in \u201cNight,\u201d where the resistance and ravishment can be read as a spiritual struggle. The remainder of \u201cTejas\u201d drops this thread, though, and its color, the boldest Ms. Srinivasan has, fades into day.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "feature", "ptime": 20140810174251, "twitter": {"description": "The choreographer Malini Srinivasan brings sensuality to the dance suite \u201cTejas Luminous.\u201d", "title": "\u2018Tejas Luminous,\u2019 Featuring Malini Srinivasan", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/11/arts/dance/tejas-luminous-featuring-malini-srinivasan.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003048825"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/11/arts/dance/tejas-luminous-featuring-malini-srinivasan.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003048825", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/11/arts/dance/tejas-luminous-featuring-malini-srinivasan.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "arts/dance", "hdl_p": "Dread, Desire and a Lover\u2019s Betrayal, All in the Passage of One Day", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/arts/dance/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Aug. 10, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Dancing,New York International Fringe Festival,Srinivasan  Malini", "description": "The choreographer Malini Srinivasan brings sensuality to the dance suite \u201cTejas Luminous.\u201d", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Brian Seibert", "SCG": "dance", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Srinivasan, Malini", "byl": "By BRIAN SEIBERT", "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "The choreographer Malini Srinivasan brings sensuality to the dance suite \u201cTejas Luminous.\u201d", "tom": "Review", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "news_keywords": "Dance", "CG": "arts", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Aug. 10, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Review", "article": {"section": "Dance", "modified": "2014-08-11", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/arts/dance/index.jsonp", "tag": "Srinivasan, Malini", "published": "2014-08-10", "section-taxonomy-id": "C5BFA7D5-359C-427B-90E6-6B7245A6CDD8"}, "slug": "11tejas", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140811154915, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/11/arts/dance/tejas-luminous-featuring-malini-srinivasan.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article", "description": "The choreographer Malini Srinivasan brings sensuality to the dance suite \u201cTejas Luminous.\u201d", "title": "\u2018Tejas Luminous,\u2019 Featuring Malini Srinivasan"}, "pdate": 20140810, "des": "New York International Fringe Festival", "articleid": 100000003048825, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "\u2018Tejas Luminous,\u2019 Featuring Malini Srinivasan", "col": "Dance Review", "PST": "Review"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe18f0\"", "article_summary": "The remainder of \u201cTejas\u201d drops this thread, though, and its color, the boldest Ms. Srinivasan has, fades into day.\nIn the program note for her dance suite \u201cTejas Luminous,\u201d Malini Srinivasan, a dancer and choreographer of the classical Indian style Bharata Natyam, writes of spiritual questions.\nThis back story should not surprise anyone who has watched Ms. Srinivasan dance.\nAt the end of \u201cDusk,\u201d Ms. Srinivasan is the last to leave.\nThe five dancers other than Ms. Srinivasan share her endearing enthusiasm, though that\u2019s the positive side of varying degrees of amateurishness that sap her designs of some of their potential power."}
