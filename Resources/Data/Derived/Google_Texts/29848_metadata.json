His visit was a reminder of the country\u2019s vast and largely unnoticed nuclear infrastructure.\n\nRelated: How the U.S.-Russia Rift Leads to a Nuclear Stalemate\n\nFor the most part, this infrastructure has been left untouched since the end of the Cold War nearly 20 years ago. According to Michaela Dodge, an analyst of defense and security policy at the Heritage Foundation, the United States has not been actively trying to develop nuclear weapons since. But rivals like Russia and China have active nuclear programs and have been developing new nuclear technology for the last two decades.\n\n\u201cThey are conducting self-critical experiments. They have been maintaining a massive nuclear production base. They\u2019ve been building new delivery systems,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cIn terms of capability, we are not on top when it comes to quantity, that\u2019s for sure. During the cold war we built Ferraris of nuclear weapons. Whether states managed to catch up in the last 20 years is a question for the intelligence community.\u201d\n\nHans M. Kristensen, director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists says even if the Russians and the Chinese have not caught up to the United States, the American nuclear infrastructure is badly in need of upgrades.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s infrastructure, the factories that built this stuff, Cold War facilities are being replaced by modern facilities. This is causing problems because it\u2019s very expensive to build. The administration is struggling to afford these things,\u201d he said. \u201cAll these investment points have peaked and come together. You have investments needed in all of these systems. We have to build a whole new generation of nuclear submarines. At some point we\u2019ll have to replace the land-based missiles. They\u2019re planning to build a new fleet of bombers.\u201d\n\nRelated: How North Korea Starved Its People for a Nuke\n\n\u201cThe delivery systems, the factories, the warhead life extension programs that are planned, within the next decade, they are in the range of $215 billion,\u201d Kristensen continued. \u201cAfter that it will continue to increase even more. These are enormous investments.\u201d\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office estimated that spending level could go even higher. In a December 2013 report to Congress, CBO estimated that upgrade over the next decade would cost $335 billion.\n\nKristensen said that it\u2019s difficult to determine how much the government actually spends on the U.S. nuclear weapons program because agencies that support it are spread across government.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen studies argue that over the last 3 to 4 years, we spent something in the order of $10 to $30 billion,\u201d he said. \u201cWithin the next three decades, the U.S. is projected to spend a trillion dollars on weapons to modernize and maintain nuclear forces.\u201d\n\nUndefined mission\n\nAll of this spending is happening without a clear nuclear strategy for the future. Kristensen said that most of U.S. nuclear planning is done with Russia in mind. Hostile countries like North Korea and Pakistan don\u2019t have the capability to strike the United States.\n\n\u201cRussia is the only country that has an enormous nuclear force that could threaten the existence of the United States,\u201d he said.\n\nThis spending also comes after President Obama pledged to reduce nuclear stockpiles last year in Berlin.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite ironic in that he has visionary objective but in fact has made very small reductions and is modernizing every component of the nuclear establishment,\u201d said Barry M. Blechman, co-founder of the Stimson Center, a think tank dedicated to international security. \u201cYou wonder what happened to his promise.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from the Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The U.S. nuclear arsenal is badly in need of an upgrade.
