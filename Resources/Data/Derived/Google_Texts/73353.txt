Canadian County Sheriff's deputies arrested an Oklahoma City man for the possession and distribution of child pornography on Wednesday.

According to the Sheriff's office, Walter M. Miller III, 34, was taken into custody at his home following a three-day investigation. Investigators said they were able to download a pornographic video of under-aged children being sexually molested by adult males. They obtained a search warrant after learning that the video was shared online from Miller's computer.

Investigators said they set up at Miller's home, and executed the search warrant once they learned that Miller was not only home, but actively online trading child porn.

According to the Sheriff's office, Miller confessed to his illegal online activities. He told investigators that he was only trying to satisfy his curiosity about child porn, and that he would usually surf the internet to find an image that would sexually aroused him enough to masturbate.

"Anyone who needs to satisfy an urge to see what sexually molesting a child looks like has a serious problem. Satisfying these curiosities often leads to fantasies being acted out on real children," said Randall Edwards, Canadian County Sheriff.

Miller was taken into custody, and a number of computers, and other electronic devices were seized from his home for forensic analysis, according to the Sheriff's office.

Miller was booked into the Canadian County Jail on complaints of Possession of Child Pornography, Distribution of Child Pornography and Violations of the Computer Crimes Act. He is being held on $130,000 bond.

The Canadian County Sheriff's Office continues to work as members of the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation's Internet Crimes Against Children task force, and is assisted with polygraph examinations by the United States Secret Service.
