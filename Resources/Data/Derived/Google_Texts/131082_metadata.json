The best you can do is \u201cwin the right to fight another day.\u201d That\u2019s certainly true of the 20-year battle between conservationists and the U.S. Navy, over the military\u2019s use of sonar and the deadly effect its equipment has on the oceans\u2019 whales.\n\nIt was, in fact, just two conservationists: Ken Balcomb, a whale researcher and himself a Navy veteran, and Joel Reynolds, an environmental lawyer with the Natural Resources Defense Council, who worked to link Navy training exercises to the mass strandings of whales on nearby coastlines \u2014 and who took the battle all the way to the Supreme Court. The stakes \u2014 the existence of a majestic species versus national security \u2014 were massive, passions were high and each small, incremental victory came only with great personal sacrifice. It was, in other words, quite the story \u2014 one that took Horwitz nearly seven years to tell.\n\n\u201cWar of the Whales,\u201d his resulting book, depicts not just the epic story of this ongoing fight, but of the sincere, often underappreciated dedication required of those who choose to take on such battles, and the ways in which such dedication can ultimately pay off. That Balcomb and Reynolds lost their Supreme Court case does little to undermine the progress they made in protecting not just whales, but all marine life, Horwitz argues \u2014 and makes it all the more important that the effort continue today.\n\nSalon spoke with Horwitz about what he calls \u201ca story of love and obsession gone bad\u201d on the part of the Navy, and about what Balcomb and Reynolds\u2019 response can teach us about the other high-stakes battles of our time. Our conversation, lightly edited for length and clarity, follows:\n\nWhat drew you into this story?\n\nI\u2019m an author as well as a book packager, and like anyone else who works in long-form storytelling, I\u2019m always looking for a great untold story. I stumbled on this really as a headline: \u201cWhales versus Navy,\u201d about the legal case between the NRDC and the U.S. Navy. It was a long-running lawsuit, and it read sort of like a divorce headline, and as I dug deeper into the story I realized it really was in some ways a story of love and obsession gone bad \u2014 the Navy\u2019s own obsession with whales and dolphins went back to the beginnings of the Cold War. And so when I realized this was more than just a contemporary environment verse national security story, and there was really a rich history of cultural war between the military, and specifically the Navy \u2014 which has been deploying militarized dolphins and whales for 40 years, and has researched and studied them for 50 years \u2014 and on the other side you have a \u201cSave the Whales\u201d movement that came of age during that same period, and then it all came to a head in the \u201990s and specifically in the last 10 years. It\u2019s just a great story, a genuinely untold story with great characters, and then the whales, which were a wonderful x-factor, which became more and more the draw for me as I got deeper into it.\n\nSo did you see a shift between when the Navy was using dolphins and whales to serve their purposes and then later on, when they\u2019re harming them with sonar?\n\nThere were always parallel programs. So they started their marine animal training program and their marine animal research programs at the same time in the early \u201960s, and the training program was always designed to basically take advantage of their trainability. They worked with small cetaceans \u2014 not just dolphins but orcas and beluga whales and even seals \u2014 and they would take advantage of the echo-location, or biosonar, capabilities of small whales. They were using them initially to clear mines from harbors in Vietnam and to also patrol harbors from enemy swimmers as well as to retrieve objects from the deep ocean floor that had fallen off of ships. And that continues today. They\u2019re still using the Navy dolphins \u2014 or militarized dolphins, whatever you want to call them \u2014 in the Persian gulf, because despite the Navy\u2019s efforts to create a dolphin drone that would do the same thing that these animals do, they haven\u2019t really approached their skill level.\n\nSo that was one strand, and then the other, their marine science research program, that was really trying to deconstruct and reverse-engineer their biosonar, which is echo-location in the same way that bats echo-locate in the air. The Navy became intrigued by these animals, really obsessed with them, because they could do things that the Navy had been trying to do in terms of lighting up the dark oceans with sound. The thing you have to understand about whales is that they live in a very dark environment. And so they\u2019ve evolved over tens of millions of years to navigate and hunt in the dark and that\u2019s what the Navy has to do. They have to navigate and potentially hunt and track, locate and kill enemy submarines in the total dark. And so they do that acoustically, either by listening for submarines or using active sonar to bounce sound off of them. They\u2019ve been doing this, crudely, since World War I, but compared to what they discovered whales and dolphins have been doing for millions of years, they realized that they were way behind and that these animals have had a huge head start and were just maestros of sound. A whale, a dolphin can tell the difference between a decoy mine and a real mine, they can tell the difference between a disc made out of copper and made out of zinc. They can find objects that are buried 6 feet in the mud of the ocean floor, half a mile down. They can do remarkable things and it\u2019s because they have evolved to use their biosonar in very specialized marine environments over eons.\n\nSo that\u2019s a long way of saying that there are two fundamental ironies that grabbed and held me and guide the story. One is that there was no marine mammal research before the Navy got involved \u2014 it didn\u2019t even have a name. Once they realized that these animals echo-located and wanted to learn more and train them, and try to reverse-engineer their biosonar, they recruited biologists, veterinarians, anybody they could find who was a bioacoustician. They basically created this whole science and mostly what we know about dolphins comes from Navy-funded research, and this information fed directly into their development of their sonar systems. The other tragic irony of this story is that the Navy came to deploy more and more powerful super sonars, long-distance sonars, if you will, high-intensity sonars, that ended up causing not just mass strandings of certain species of whales but real non-lethal impacts on whales of all species, as well as all marine life. They\u2019ve done studies now that show even coral withers in the presence of intense sound, so they really have just been dumping huge amounts of sound energy into the ocean and we\u2019re only now coming to understand the consequences of that.\n\nSo far as the Navy\u2019s use of these marine animals goes, would you characterize it as exploitative?\n\nWhat other adjective might you assign?\n\nI\u2019m thinking of Sea World and just using them for entertainment value, while this is serving a national security function.\n\nWell, for Sea World that\u2019s serving their commercial value, it\u2019s a commercial driver. And scientists have studied them in captivity (although less and less); you could say the scientists are exploiting them for their own research. And the fact that most of the scientists are funded by the Navy is not an accident.\n\nI mean, look, the \u201cWar of the Whales\u201d is a culture clash between the Navy, which cares deeply about the oceans and whales but for totally different reasons than the \u201cSave the Whales\u201d movement or any of the environmental, humane or conservation concerns might be about whales. So they have very opposing agendas and this is what played out in court and eventually in the Supreme Court. I think what\u2019s interesting is, there\u2019s no longer debate that sonar causes stranding: There were just strandings in April, involving U.S. Greek and Israeli navies in war games in the Mediterranean. So this isn\u2019t a situation that\u2019s gone away and the Navy acknowledges that they need to take better steps to prevent mass strandings, but they still happen.\n\nThe question was, is it exploitive? Well, I certainly believe that these animals did not join the Navy, they were pressed into service. Let me put it this way: If you\u2019re going to make the decision that you\u2019re going to capture animals in the wild and breed them in captivity, explicitly to train them to clear minefields and do other hazardous work on your behalf for military purposes, the least you can do is take every measure possible not to cause mass strandings of other whales during sonar training exercises \u2014 and again, all these lawsuits are around training exercises. Right now there\u2019s an aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf, named after George H.W. Bush, that\u2019s a vulnerable target. If you\u2019re the Navy, you want to make sure a rogue submarine doesn\u2019t fire a torpedo at it, so obviously they\u2019re using sonar in the Gulf to defend the ship, and no one\u2019s saying that they shouldn\u2019t. What they\u2019re saying is, if you\u2019re doing training exercises don\u2019t do them in known whale habitats when whales are there, they\u2019re seasonally there; do it when they\u2019re not there. I mean, that seems straightforward, right? To me that\u2019s a no-brainer.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Author Joshua Horwitz on the epic showdown between marine life and national security", "title": "\u201cA story of love and obsession gone bad\u201d: How the U.S. Navy is killing the world\u2019s whales", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Author Joshua Horwitz on the epic showdown between marine life and national security", "title": "\u201cA story of love and obsession gone bad\u201d: How the U.S. Navy is killing the world\u2019s whales", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/07/26/a_story_of_love_and_obsession_gone_bad_how_the_u_s_navy_is_killing_the_worlds_whales/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/whale_tail_resize.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Author Joshua Horwitz on the epic showdown between marine life and national security", "title": "\u201cA story of love and obsession gone bad\u201d: How the U.S. Navy is killing the world\u2019s whales", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/whale_tail_resize.jpg", "creator": "@readingirl", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Lindsay Abrams", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Coral, Editor's Picks, marine conservation, marine life, sonar, U.S. Navy, Whales", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "I stumbled on this really as a headline: \u201cWhales versus Navy,\u201d about the legal case between the NRDC and the U.S. Navy.\nTopics: Coral, Editor's Picks, marine conservation, marine life, sonar, U.S. Navy, Whales, Sustainability News, Life News, Politics News\u201cYou never truly win a conservation battle,\u201d says Joshua Horwitz.\nSo far as the Navy\u2019s use of these marine animals goes, would you characterize it as exploitative?\nSo did you see a shift between when the Navy was using dolphins and whales to serve their purposes and then later on, when they\u2019re harming them with sonar?\nThe Navy became intrigued by these animals, really obsessed with them, because they could do things that the Navy had been trying to do in terms of lighting up the dark oceans with sound."}
