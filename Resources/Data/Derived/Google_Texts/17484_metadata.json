Doctor Zsolt Garami of the Houston Methodist Hospital told BBC, \u201cThe idea is for him to be the best medic, nurse and physician.\u201d\n\nThere are currently four versions of the robot, one of which is posted at the International Space Station, and according to BBC more are in the works.\n\nIn space, sadly, Robonaut 2 is far from its final goal. It cannot yet walk in zero gravity and thus far its most exciting achievement has been to catch a roll of duct tape. The android currently only has a torso, head and arms. It serves as the space station\u2019s cleaner, and also monitors air flow in the space station\u2019s vents.\n\nWhen its legs arrive in an upcoming supply mission, Robonaut will learn to walk, clean handrails and do other mundane tasks. According to the NASA, its feet have cameras in them so it knows where it is going. The legs also have seven joints and have a leg-span of 9 feet. The legs will give it the ability to walk in space as well \u2014 which it can do once its torso has been upgraded.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Robonaut's current duty is to clean, but in the future the robot will be able to give shots or even operate", "title": "Robonaut will see you now: NASA building robotic doctors to operate in space", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Robonaut's current duty is to clean, but in the future the robot will be able to give shots or even operate", "title": "Robonaut will see you now: NASA building robotic doctors to operate in space", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/04/04/robonaut_will_see_you_now_nasa_building_robotic_doctors_to_operate_in_space/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/04/11211032373_2aa13dc17d_b-768x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Robonaut's current duty is to clean, but in the future the robot will be able to give shots or even operate", "title": "Robonaut will see you now: NASA building robotic doctors to operate in space", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/04/11211032373_2aa13dc17d_b-768x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sarah Gray", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Gadgets, innovation, NASA, robots, Space, technology", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8da3\"", "article_summary": "It serves as the space station\u2019s cleaner, and also monitors air flow in the space station\u2019s vents.\nTopics: Gadgets, innovation, NASA, robots, Space, technology, Innovation News, Technology NewsThe U.S. Navy is toying with shipboard robotic firefighters, but NASA is looking even further into the robo-future with into robotic space doctors.\nRobonaut, as the robot is known, would be used as a telemedicine doctor for remote areas, like space.\nThe legs will give it the ability to walk in space as well \u2014 which it can do once its torso has been upgraded.\nIn space, sadly, Robonaut 2 is far from its final goal."}
