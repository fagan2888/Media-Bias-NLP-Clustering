Pop trifecta Ariana Grande, Nicki Minaj, and Jessie J kicked off the 2014 VMAs, each appearing for a solo performance and then uniting at the end to perform their collaboration “Bang Bang.” Grande performed her single “Break Free” for the first time live, which was pretty neat until Nicki Minaj upstaged her with “Anaconda,” and then we forgot about everything that came before Minaj’s booty-shaking. Minaj bowed out to Jessie J, who carried “Bang Bang” until Grande and Minaj changed costumes and joined in.
