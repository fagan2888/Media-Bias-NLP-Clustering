The leader of Anthem Blue Cross in California, the state's largest for-profit health insurer, is leaving for another job.

Mark Morgan, 48, president of the company's California business since 2013, will depart April 24.

Pam Kehaly, his predecessor in California and president of Anthem Inc.'s West region, announced Morgan's departure to company employees in a memo Friday.

She said that "while Mark will be pursuing his interests elsewhere in the healthcare space, I know leaving Anthem is bittersweet for him. Markâ€™s career in the health insurance industry spans more than 20 years and he has made many great contributions during his nearly seven-year tenure at Anthem."

Morgan's next employer wasn't disclosed, and he referred a request for comment to Anthem. Morgan isn't leaving to work for another health insurer, according to a person familiar with the matter.

He took the helm in California just as the company was gearing up for the Affordable Care Act and the rollout of the state's health insurance exchange.

Anthem has the highest enrollment in the Covered California exchange with a 28% share of the market, according to state figures released last month.

But the company has also taken heat from California regulators over its error-filled provider directory, and it faces numerous consumer lawsuits related to network inaccuracies.

Anthem has disputed the state's findings and said there's no evidence that patients were having widespread difficulty finding a doctor.

Company executives have also been trying to regain customers' trust after a massive data breach exposed personal information on nearly 79 million people nationwide, including 13.5 million in California.

The Indianapolis-based company is the nation's second-largest health insurer behind UnitedHealth Group Inc.
