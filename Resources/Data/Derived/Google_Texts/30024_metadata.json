By nightfall, the temperatures are expected to be in the upper teens with winds whipping at 20 to 30 miles an hour.\n\n\u201cThe city will be using liquid brine on the streets,\u201d said Jersey City spokeswoman Jennifer Morrill.\n\nThe resources of municipalities have been tested by multiple snowstorms this winter. Thursday\u2019s storm dropped roughly a foot of snow on the county and exhausted Jersey City\u2019s supply.\n\n\u201cWe are in the same situation every city in the region is, in that our salt resources have been drained due to the back-to-back storms causing a shortage of supply in the region,\u201d Morrill said.\n\nYesterday was a brief reprieve from the snow, a welcome break for Zuheir Bader, general manager of Chevrolet of Jersey City.\n\nWith each storm Bader has to dig out more than 200 cars, move them, plow and then put them back.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t sell a car if it\u2019s covered with snow,\u201d said Bader, whose dealership is located at Communipaw and Mallory avenues. \u201cWe have to do it every time it snows, even 2 or 3 inches. We do not like snow very much.\u201d\n\nIn the north end of the\n\ncounty, firefighters are dealing with a different problem \u2014 digging out some 1,000 fire hydrants.\n\nAll 15 North Hudson Regional Fire & Rescue companies are out digging out hydrants that \u201care completely buried, as opposed to those that have some snow,\u201d but can be accessed, NHRFR Co-director Jeff Welz said.\n\nAs for the next storm, Bayonne Mayor Mark Smith said his city is prepared. \u201cWe have an adequate amount of salt and our personnel are squared away and ready to go,\u201d he said.\n\nWest New York was expecting a delivery of three truckloads of salt yesterday, while North Bergen was conserving as much as possible. North Bergen spokesman Phil Swibinski said crews will plow and salt the hills and primary roads, but only plow the secondary roads.\n\nHudson County will have 24 vehicles out battling the snow in the county roads and county spokesman Jim Kennelly said there is \u201csufficient salt for taking care of the roads this Saturday.\u201d Kennelly said the county will be spreading brine in advance of the snowfall.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "hudson county,jersey-city,north-bergen", "title": "Jersey City councilman says city has no salt in store for today's expected snowfall", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Jersey City councilman says city has no salt in store for today\\u0027s expected snowfall\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/2014/02/councilman_richard_boggiano_sa.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/jersey-journal/photo/2014/02/14280480-large.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"12207432\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-02-15T08:05:00Z\", \"author\": \"Michaelangelo Conte | The Jersey Journal\", \"tags\": [\"hudson county\",\"jersey-city\",\"north-bergen\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.nj.com/jersey-journal/photo/2014/02/14280480-small.jpg", "creator": "http://twitter/jerseyjournal", "site": "@njdotcom", "card": "summary", "description": "The local weather forecast calls for 1 to 3 inches of snow today, but Jersey City Incinerator Authority crews will try to keep the streets clear without any salt, a city council member confirmed last night."}, "article_date_updated": "Saturday, February 15, 2014, 10:53 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.nj.com/jersey-journal/photo/2014/02/14280480-large.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"mconte\", \"author_nickname\": \"Michaelangelo Conte | The Jersey Journal\", \"author_id\": \"1860104\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Jersey Journal Print Edition\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "The local weather forecast calls for 1 to 3 inches of snow today, but Jersey City Incinerator Authority crews will try to keep the streets clear without any salt, a city council member confirmed last night.", "title": "Jersey City councilman says city has no salt in store for today's expected snowfall", "url": "http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/2014/02/councilman_richard_boggiano_sa.html", "image": "http://media.nj.com/design/alpha/img/logo_njo.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Saturday, February 15, 2014,  3:00 AM", "article_author": "Michaelangelo Conte | The Jersey Journal", "Description": "The local weather forecast calls for 1 to 3 inches of snow today, but Jersey City Incinerator Authority crews will try to keep the streets clear without any salt, a city council member confirmed last night."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda0e4\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI was told they have no salt, so as far as I\u2019m concerned, there is no salt,\u201d Jersey City Councilman Richard Boggiano said.\n\u201cThe city will be using liquid brine on the streets,\u201d said Jersey City spokeswoman Jennifer Morrill.\nYesterday was a brief reprieve from the snow, a welcome break for Zuheir Bader, general manager of Chevrolet of Jersey City.\nWith each storm Bader has to dig out more than 200 cars, move them, plow and then put them back.\nNorth Bergen spokesman Phil Swibinski said crews will plow and salt the hills and primary roads, but only plow the secondary roads."}
