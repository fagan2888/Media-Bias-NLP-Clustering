Michael Moore doesn\u2019t even say that\u2026 On the stage at a Republican debate, Donald Trump defended Planned Parenthood. Not the abortion stuff, he said, but the fact that they do great things for women\u2019s health. Folks, there were a number of occasions where Donald Trump sounded like the Daily Kos blog, where Donald Trump sounded like the Democrat Underground, sounded like any average host on MSNBC.\n\nNailed him. But wait \u2014 why is Rush dropping the hammer on Trump now when he\u2019s been at pains not to say that he\u2019s an inferior choice to Ted Cruz or Marco Rubio? Rush praised Cruz last week as the closest we\u2019ve come to Reagan since the great man passed, but even that apparent endorsement was qualified by him stressing that you should support Cruz \u201cif conservatism is the dominating factor in how you vote.\u201d Emphasis: \u201cIf.\u201d Were Trump\u2019s debate answers about 9/11, Iraq, and Planned Parenthood so egregious that even Rush is ready to drop the \u201cif\u201d and declare, categorically, that he\u2019s unfit to be the GOP nominee?\n\nNope. Not yet, anyway. The clip below, cut by Team Cruz, naturally contains the most damning bits of what Rush said today but omits the part where he defended Trump\u2019s motives. Maybe Trump wasn\u2019t giving us his honest opinion, Rush suggests. Maybe he was pandering strategically to the center because he\u2019s one step ahead of the game in South Carolina:\n\nI said to myself, \u201cNow, wait a minute. What\u2019s going on?\u201d Trump is not \u2014 I don\u2019t care what any of you think, he\u2019s not stupid. He has political advisors. He has a lot of people who are conservatives who are there to tell him where the boundaries are, and he crossed those boundaries on Saturday\u2026 Short version, I think Trump strategically was making a move on independents and Democrats in South Carolina since it\u2019s open. And I think that he wants to wrap this up ASAP. I think he wants a blow \u2019em out, going-away win in South Carolina. I think he just wants to wrap this up. I think he thinks he can\u2026 So, Trump literally with Democrat lingo \u2014 liberal Democrat lingo \u2014 in the debate on Planned Parenthood, on the Iraq war, on 9/11, on weapons of mass destruction. Never before has he said it, but never before have we had an open primary yet. This is an open primary. Democrats and independents can cross and vote. If there\u2019s something else going on here, that Trump lost control, and who he really is surfaced, then it was gonna happen at some point, and it happened on Saturday night. If that\u2019s what really happened.\n\nGoing back to this morning\u2019s post, where does that defense land in my debate with Ace over whether Trump\u2019s Iraq answer will hurt him on the right or not? You could say it proves Ace right \u2014 if Rush Limbaugh is complaining on air that Trump sounds like Michael Moore and a dKos contributor, that\u2019s probably not going to help him lock down any new conservative votes. My point in the earlier post, though, was that anyone who\u2019s sufficiently well disposed towards Trump to consider backing him probably isn\u2019t going to be turned by a few outre comments about Bush. The fact that even Rush is willing to let him off the hook on grounds that he\u2019s making a strategic move suggests one way Trump fans might ease their cognitive dissonance over supporting a guy who believes something they don\u2019t about Bush\u2019s motives in Iraq. Maybe Trump simply didn\u2019t mean it. Maybe he\u2019s just playing eight-dimensional chess. He\u2019s told us repeatedly that he\u2019s capable of \u201cchanging\u201d as needed to maintain his advantage over his opponents, right? Well, there you go. He did it again on Saturday night to lure independents. Maybe he really does believe that Bush lied about Iraq\u2019s WMDs, just like maybe he really believes he\u2019s going to deport everyone. Or maybe he\u2019s saying that because he stands to benefit from it electorally, in which case we all must stand back and applaud his political genius. How can we hold a nasty, false attack on Bush against him \u2014 even as he screeches about Ted Cruz\u2019s dirty pool \u2014 when he\u2019s only doing what a winner would do?\n\nThat\u2019s the first clip below. The second, which I couldn\u2019t find anywhere else to put, is of an answer Trump gave today about Obama\u2019s executive amnesty in which he appears at one point to say \u201cI think it\u2019s great\u201d and then says only that he\u2019ll take a look at it when asked if he\u2019ll rescind it. Sounds mighty damning \u2014 but in all fairness, it looks like Trump\u2019s simply out to lunch on the terminology of \u201cdeferred action.\u201d He\u2019s said many times that he\u2019d blow up Obama\u2019s executive amnesties; I think he just got confused here about what the reporter was referring to. Watch the answer anyway, though, as it\u2019s a sterling example of why Trump is such a force in the primary. His response about wanting Americans to be \u201cdreamers\u201d is pure nationalism but it\u2019s highly, highly effective, especially the segue into how little Obama and the Democrats have done for black voters. Everyone likes to crow over Trump\u2019s poll numbers but you hear him say something like this and wonder how he could possibly be polling under 50 percent. Then you remember the 8,000 things he\u2019s said to annoy you and think, \u201cOh, right.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "\u201cFolks, there were a number of occasions where Donald Trump sounded like the Daily Kos blog\u2026\u201d", "title": "Rush Limbaugh: Let\u2019s face it, Trump sounded like a liberal Democrat in some of the things he said at the debate", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2016/02/15/rush-limbaugh-lets-face-it-trump-sounded-like-a-liberal-democrat-in-some-of-the-things-he-said-at-the-debate/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@allahpundit"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "keywords": "9/11, Daily Kos, democrat, Donald Trump, Iraq, liberal, Michael Moore, Rush Limbaugh, strategy,", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-16T01:01:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-15T23:58:17+00:00"}, "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "article_summary": "Folks, there were a number of occasions where Donald Trump sounded like the Daily Kos blog, where Donald Trump sounded like the Democrat Underground, sounded like any average host on MSNBC.\nRush Limbaugh: Let\u2019s face it, Trump sounded like a liberal Democrat in some of the things he said at the debateposted at 8:01 pm on February 15, 2016 by AllahpunditAt long last, the moment when Rush finally turned on Trump!\nMaybe he really does believe that Bush lied about Iraq\u2019s WMDs, just like maybe he really believes he\u2019s going to deport everyone.\nWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Trump is not \u2014 I don\u2019t care what any of you think, he\u2019s not stupid.\nMaybe Trump simply didn\u2019t mean it."}
