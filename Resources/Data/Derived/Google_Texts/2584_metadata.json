A group of about 50 protesters marched from the White House to Capitol Hill, chanting \u201cObama, Obama, did you see? Christian blood in the sea.\u201d\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nAccording to a report at the Washington Post, organizer Hanna Asaad was moved to action by the abduction and beheading of his best friend and cousin Samuel Alham, who was one of the twenty Copts lined up on a beach and beheaded by the Islamic State in Libya.\n\n\u201cI kept calling my cousin and telling him he had to leave Libya, but there was no safe way out,\u201d Asaad told the Post. \u201cThe militants came looking for Christians and then took them away. They murdered my cousin, my nephew and my classmates. Someday soon they will start murdering people in this country.\u201d He noted that targeting Copts for murder is easy, as they tend to have small crosses tattooed on their wrists.\n\n\u201cISIS wants to drive all Christians from the Middle East. Obama has to act before the whole region turns to fire,\u201d another demonstrator warned. The demonstrators also included Boko Haram in Nigeria and the Muslim Brotherhood in their roll call of villains. I would advise them not to hold their breath waiting for the Obama Administration to call out the Muslim Brotherhood, which was last seen grinning and popping selfies at the State Department.\n\nThe Washington Post amusingly portrays President Obama as a passive bystander to the \u201cincreasingly chaotic situation in the Middle East since the Arab Spring of 2011, including the rise of the Islamic State, the deepening Sunni-Shiite conflict in Iraq, the collapse of the Muslim Brotherhood government in Egypt, the intransigence of Syria\u2019s dictatorship and the deadly attack on a U.S. consulate in Libya.\u201d President Obama derided the Islamic State Obama as the \u201cjunior varsity league\u201d of terrorism when they rolled into Iraq, supported the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, reinfornced the intransigent Syrian dictatorship with his foolish \u201cred line\u201d bluster and subsequent humiliation by Syria\u2019s patrons in Russia, and had his administration claim the deadly attack on a U.S. consulate in Libya was a spontaneous protest over an offensive YouTube video.\n\nDespite their small number, the Egyptian Christians living in Washington might be able to get some attention because, as the Washington Post observes, they tend to be \u201caffluent, well-organized U.S. citizens.\u201d The orange-jumpsuit protesters quoted in the article are all white-collar professionals. The lingering question would be exactly what they hope the American government will do for their friends and relatives in the Middle East. Some observers feel the damage done to certain Christian communities by ISIS is irreversible. The Islamic State is their most aggressive enemy, but not the only one; stories about the Christian exodus from Iraq stretch back deep into the previous decade. The Copts might have a better chance of retaining their position in Egypt than most other Christian communities in the region, especially if the Muslim Brotherhood is out of power for good.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In light of the targeting of Christians by the Islamic State--particularly in Libya and Syria--Christian Coptics in the United States assembled before the White House this week to demand the Obama administration address the plight of their brethren in the Middle East.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "In light of the targeting of Christians by the Islamic State--particularly in Libya and Syria--Christian Coptics in the United States assembled before the White House this week to demand the Obama administration address the plight of their brethren in the Middle East.", "title": "Coptic Christians Hold Orange-Jumpsuit Protest at White House - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/02/ISIS-21-Christians-YouTube-via-NBC.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2015/02/25/coptic-christians-hold-orange-jumpsuit-protest-at-white-house/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In light of the targeting of Christians by the Islamic State--particularly in Libya and Syria--Christian Coptics in the United States assembled before the White House this week to demand the Obama administration address the plight of their brethren in the Middle East.", "title": "Coptic Christians Hold Orange-Jumpsuit Protest at White House - Breitbart", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/02/ISIS-21-Christians-YouTube-via-NBC.jpg", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Beheading, Coptic Christians, Egypt, ISIS, Islamic State, Libya,Faith, Jihad, National Security,coptic christians", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Faith", "tag": "Libya", "published_time": "2015-02-25T12:10:29-07:00", "categories": "National Security,Jihad,Faith"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc952f\"", "article_summary": "A group of about 50 protesters marched from the White House to Capitol Hill, chanting \u201cObama, Obama, did you see?\nThe demonstrators also included Boko Haram in Nigeria and the Muslim Brotherhood in their roll call of villains.\nThe Islamic State is their most aggressive enemy, but not the only one; stories about the Christian exodus from Iraq stretch back deep into the previous decade.\nThe Copts might have a better chance of retaining their position in Egypt than most other Christian communities in the region, especially if the Muslim Brotherhood is out of power for good.\nI would advise them not to hold their breath waiting for the Obama Administration to call out the Muslim Brotherhood, which was last seen grinning and popping selfies at the State Department."}
