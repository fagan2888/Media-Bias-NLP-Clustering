Pete Sessions in the Republican primary.\n\nSessions of Dallas is chairman of the influential Rules Committee and one of the most powerful Republicans in the House.\n\nBut Pierson and other tea party activists have soured on him in recent months, saying that he\u2019s not standing up for conservative principles or doing enough to stop the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law.\n\n\u201cThe people of my hometown deserve an elected leader who will fight for them \u2014 a leader who won\u2019t play the go-along-to-get-along, business-as-usual politics that have been hurting this country for so long,\u201d Pierson said in a written statement announcing her campaign.\n\nSessions said he looked forward to discussing his record and the issues facing the residents of his district.\n\n\u201cNorth Texans deserve a leader who stands behind principled solutions, not rhetoric,\u201d Sessions said in a written statement. \u201cI\u2019m confident that my conservative record speaks for itself and that my constituents will continue to trust my leadership as their representative in Congress.\u201d\n\nJust how formidable Pierson will be against Sessions is unclear. She\u2019s making her first run for public office, though she\u2019s been instrumental in several high-profile campaigns, including Republican Ted Cruz\u2019s Senate victory last year.\n\nPierson got involved in the tea party movement after hearing about meetings across the country on a conservative radio show. She showed up at a Dallas-area event and quickly got involved.\n\nA single mother from Garland, Pierson said she would put the needs of everyday Americans ahead of special interests.\n\n\u201cPoliticians who have been in Washington far too long \u2014 who once had the appearance of stellar voting records \u2014 have rapidly sacrificed their principles in the name of political expediency,\u201d she said.\n\nAfter Pierson announced her intention to run against Sessions, she was quickly endorsed by the political arm of the conservative group FreedomWorks. The group\u2019s support was also crucial to Cruz\u2019s campaign.\n\n\u201cKatrina Pierson has led the fight to elect principled conservatives across the state of Texas for years,\u201d said Matt Kibbe, president of the FreedomWorks PAC. \u201cWhile incumbent Rep. Pete Sessions seems more concerned with keeping his seat at the leadership table, Katrina understands the importance of connecting to the grassroots at home and sticking to your guns in Washington.\u201d\n\nSessions represents the 32{+n}{+d} Congressional District. It includes parts of northern and eastern Dallas County. He has been in Congress since 1997.\n\nThough he\u2019s being attacked by some tea party groups, Sessions points out that he has a solid conservative record. He has a 97 percent rating from the American Conservative Union, an A+ ranking from the National Rifle Association and a 100 percent rating from the National Right to Life.\n\nAnd during his stint as chairman of the National Republican Campaign Committee, he helped the party gain 63 seats in the House, retaking the majority in 2010.\n\nFollow Gromer Jeffers Jr. on Twitter at @gromerjeffers.", "article_metadata": {"description": "She accused him of abandoning conservative principles, while the incumbent touted his ratings on issues and gains for the party.", "og": {"description": "She accused him of abandoning conservative principles, while the incumbent touted his ratings on issues and gains for the party.", "title": "Tea party activist Katrina Pierson challenges Pete Sessions for Dallas congressional seat", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/headlines/20130912-tea-party-activist-katrina-pierson-challenges-pete-sessions-for-dallas-congressional-seat.ece", "image": {"width": 345, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg", "height": 345}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2013-09-16T16:20:00Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2013-09-13T04:22:46Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Tea party activist Katrina Pierson challenges Pete Sessions for Dallas congressional seat\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/headlines/20130912-tea-party-activist-katrina-pierson-challenges-pete-sessions-for-dallas-congressional-seat.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"1192572\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-09-13T04:22:46Z\", \"section\": \"Politics Headlines\", \"author\": \"GROMER JEFFERS JR.\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg", "publishtime": "2013-09-13T04:22:46Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbf73\"", "article_summary": "Dallas-area tea party leader Katrina Pierson said Thursday that she\u2019s challenging longtime Rep.
