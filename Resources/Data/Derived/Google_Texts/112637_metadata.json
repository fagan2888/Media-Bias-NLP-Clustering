But it\u2019s far from perfect. The following are a few of the questions and concerns that conservatives have been raising about Dave Camp\u2019s Tax Reform Act of 2014 (TRA):\n\n1. Though broadly supportive of Camp\u2019s efforts, Yuval Levin and Ramesh Ponnuru raise a number of red flags, e.g.: (a) tax brackets are indexed to prices (chained CPI) rather than growth in incomes, as Andrew Biggs has proposed, and so \u201cbracket creep\u201d will produce substantial tax increases on middle-income households over time; and (b) though the TRA features an increase in the size of the child tax credit, this increase is not large enough to adequately address the the over-taxation of large families.\n\n2. And though Ramesh applauds the TRA\u2019s cuts in taxes on business investment, he warns that its approach to depreciation could screw things up. Ryan Ellis of Americans for Tax Reform is also critical of this feature of the TRA. (See Alan Viard on how a slow-down in depreciation deductions might mean \u201ctaking back with the left hand everything that the rate cut gives with the right hand.\u201d) One of Camp\u2019s GOP colleagues, California Rep. Devin Nunes, goes in the opposite direction by allowing 100 percent expensing of all business-related expenditures in his American Business Competitiveness tax reform proposal, and there is some indication that Nunes\u2019s approach is gaining traction.\n\n3. Ramesh also points to the fact that one of the TRA\u2019s more substantively and politically interesting levies \u2014 its tax on banks with assets in excess of $500 billion \u2014 is a tax on assets rather than a tax on liabilities. Tim Worstall suggests that a tax on liabilities would likely prove a more effective way of reducing risk-taking on the part of \u201ctoo-big-to-fail\u201d (TBTF) banks, i.e., financial institutions that are so systemically important that they enjoy an implicit subsidy from the federal government. Those who lend to TBTF banks will charge them a lower interest rate because they are convinced that these banks enjoy a federal backstop; so one obvious step for the federal government to take would be to charge TBTF banks a market rate for what amounts to a federal insurance policy. It must be said, however, that in light of the political influence of major financial institutions, it is impressive that Camp went as far as he did, and one hopes that other Republican lawmakers will be willing to press ahead.\n\n4. My populist sympathies incline me to think well of Camp\u2019s commitment to treating carried interest as ordinary income, a commitment that could yield political dividends. Yet like Ramesh, I\u2019ve become convinced that this is easier said than done. The problem lies in maintaining a distinction between \u201ccarried interest\u201d in a hedge fund (controversial) and options in a corporation (uncontroversial) and \u201csweat equity\u201d more broadly, as Jim Manzi explained in 2007.\n\n5. Philip Klein argues that Camp ought to have been more willing to restructure the payroll tax burden.\n\n6. And the Wall Street Journal editorial page believes that Camp didn\u2019t go far enough in improving work incentives for high earners.\n\n7. The centrist Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget points to the TRA\u2019s reliance on one-time revenue sources and timing shifts as an indication that it might contribute to deficits in future decades; their general sense is that the proposal devotes too much of its base-broadening revenue to lowering rates rather than to financing public expenditures.\n\n8. One of the issues I find most interesting, and one that\u2019s been cited by several of my colleagues and comrades, is Camp\u2019s decision to eliminate the state and local tax deduction. In theory, this will end the implicit subsidy of the residents of high-tax states by the residents of low-tax states, and it might also make the residents of high-tax states more attuned to the state and local tax burden. Another view is that in the absence of the state and local tax deduction, state and local governments might under-invest in the human capital of their residents, and this in turn will shrink the tax base in future years. Coupling the elimination of the state and local tax deduction with a substantial increase in the child tax credit is an excellent way to address this concern.\n\nOverall, I\u2019m impressed by how conservatives have responded to Camp\u2019s efforts. Keep in mind that Camp has crafted a revenue-neutral reform in the wake of the so-called \u201cfiscal cliff\u201d and the advent of a wide array of Obamacare taxes, and by disregarding the likelihood that various \u201ctax extenders\u201d (notionally temporary tax provisions that are widely understood to be politically untouchable) will in fact be extended. Some conservatives maintain that Camp ought to have backed a revenue-negative reform, including Ellis of ATR. But that hasn\u2019t really been the chief objection to the plan. Rather, the objections have been pretty astute, pretty constructive thoughts on how we might make GOP tax policy stronger on substantive and political grounds.
