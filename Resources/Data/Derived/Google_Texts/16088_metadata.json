Part of the problem: it\u2019s been 50 months since Republicans promised a detailed Obamacare alternative. Sen.

Tom Cotton, the Arkansas Republican and leader of the \u201cMonsters of Hawk\u201d who signed an open letter to Iran, analysts and the White House decried a clear breach of diplomatic protocol. Now, Cotton himself is chiding Obama for harshing on Netanyahu, his BFF, just as he\u2019s setting up a coalition government in Israel: \u201cWhile Prime Minister Netanyahu won a decisive victory, he still has just started assembling a governing majority coalition.\u201d Pot meets kettle, again.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Washington Whispers [News]", "title": "Three-Minute Briefing: As Ted Cruz Gets Obamacare, GOP Alternative Still on the Drawing Board Five Years Later", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Ashraf Ghani follows Bibi in Congress, Hillary wants no-drama fundraising and Barney Frank dishes on Biden.", "title": "Three-Minute Briefing: As Ted Cruz Gets Obamacare, GOP Alternative Still on the Drawing Board Five Years Later", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/washington-whispers/2015/03/25/three-minute-briefing-as-ted-cruz-gets-obamacare-gop-alternative-still-on-the-drawing-board-five-years-later", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/09/59/3e11810845899ff203cb0069935a/150325-cruz-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ashraf Ghani follows Bibi in Congress, Hillary wants no-drama fundraising and Barney Frank dishes on Biden.", "site": "@USNews", "card": "summary", "title": "Three-Minute Briefing: As Ted Cruz Gets Obamacare, GOP Alternative Still on the Drawing Board Five Years Later"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "news", "date_published": "March 25, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Joseph P.
