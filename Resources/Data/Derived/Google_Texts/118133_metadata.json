Such organizations carefully track how patients are faring, especially if they have chronic health conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure or congestive heart failure.\n\nProponents say, ACOs should save significant money by preventing severe illnesses and expensive hospitalizations.\n\nHere are the hospitals that will be affected by Mercy's grant: Adair County Memorial Hospital; Audubon Memorial Hospital; Clarinda Regional Hospital; Dallas County Hospital; Davis County Hospital; Ellsworth Hospital; Franklin General Hospital; Grinnell Regional Hospital; Hancock County Memorial Hospital; Hawarden Community Hospital; Howard County Regional Health Services; Knoxville Hospital; Kossuth Regional Medical Center; Madison County Memorial Hospital; Manning Regional Hospital; Mercy-Centerville; Mercy-New Hampton; Mercy-North Iowa; Mercy-Sioux City; Mitchell County Hospital; Monroe County Hospital; Palo Alto County Hospital; Ringgold County Hospital; Wayne County Hospital; Van Diest Medical Center (Webster City).\n\nThe federal government also awarded similar grants Wednesday of $7 million to the Association of American Medical Colleges and nearly $9 million to Avera Health out of Sioux Falls, S.D. U.S. Sen. Tom Harkin's office said both of those grants also would help improve care for rural Iowans.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/1mhi0SO", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The money will help small hospitals join Accountable Care Organizations, which track and treat chronic conditions.", "p": {"domain_verify": "372c291dc2b106308d26264f4fba3b10"}, "og": {"site_name": "Des Moines Register", "description": "The money will help small hospitals join Accountable Care Organizations, which track and treat chronic conditions.", "title": "Feds give Mercy $10 million to improve rural health care", "url": "http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/health/2014/07/09/feds-give-mercy-10-million-to-improve-rural-health-care/12435317/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/desmoinesregister.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The money will help small hospitals join Accountable Care Organizations, which track and treat chronic conditions.", "title": "Feds give Mercy $10 million to improve rural health care", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/02d94530c013863d90408f5f99068329a9711d3a/c=90-0-358-268&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/DesMoines/DesMoines/2014/07/09/1404950012000-mercy-building.jpg", "creator": "@DMRegister", "site": "@DMRegister", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600025120", "fb": {"app_id": 169766623060429}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"category": "news/health", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b097afe00bbabd5ca9c0bd781f4ee3f9a141de82/c=158-0-358-268/local/-/media/DesMoines/DesMoines/2014/07/09/1404950012000-mercy-building.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5928a86b89d4201ab0a76f9a5e26e45a15c96d4f/c=90-0-358-268/local/-/media/DesMoines/DesMoines/2014/07/09/1404950012000-mercy-building.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c2f0f6bf7496b89ba5ed605723788647bd52d772/c=43-0-400-268/local/-/media/DesMoines/DesMoines/2014/07/09/1404950012000-mercy-building.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b4cccb09ae223c7ae7b5c1cfa43a0b2bf044df05/c=0-22-400-247&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/DesMoines/DesMoines/2014/07/09/1404950012000-mercy-building.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-07-09T21:58:52.510000-05:00", "shorthed": "Feds give Mercy $10 million to improve rural health care at 25 small hospitals.", "articleid": 12435317, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/36fb8e8692e1f772b74b355b61704c30dc19608d/c=0-22-400-247/local/-/media/DesMoines/DesMoines/2014/07/09/1404950012000-mercy-building.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4d02edac601f365e635ab5b309eccce568bca5b3/c=192-0-342-268/local/-/media/DesMoines/DesMoines/2014/07/09/1404950012000-mercy-building.jpg"}, "gci-asset-type": "story", "author": "Tony Leys", "pageclass": "article", "title": "Feds give Mercy $10 million to improve rural health care"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3652\"", "article_summary": "Here are the hospitals that will be affected by Mercy's grant: Adair County Memorial Hospital; Audubon Memorial Hospital; Clarinda Regional Hospital; Dallas County Hospital; Davis County Hospital; Ellsworth Hospital; Franklin General Hospital; Grinnell Regional Hospital; Hancock County Memorial Hospital; Hawarden Community Hospital; Howard County Regional Health Services; Knoxville Hospital; Kossuth Regional Medical Center; Madison County Memorial Hospital; Manning Regional Hospital; Mercy-Centerville; Mercy-New Hampton; Mercy-North Iowa; Mercy-Sioux City; Mitchell County Hospital; Monroe County Hospital; Palo Alto County Hospital; Ringgold County Hospital; Wayne County Hospital; Van Diest Medical Center (Webster City).\nThe three-year grant was part of $26 million in new Iowa grants made under the Affordable Care Act.\nU.S. Sen.
