The brouhaha culminated in Walsh telling Klein \u201cYou\u2019re a wonderful reporter. I read you every day. I probably read close to every word you write.\u201d\n\nSh*t just got real.\n\nAt issue was Walsh\u2019s complaint that Klein\u2019s reporting on the Obamacare website has been unbalanced, lacking in perspective, and objectionable in tone. Klein responded with \u201cshock\u201d that he was expected not to cover the rollout \u201caccurately,\u201d but rather, \u201cinstrumentally.\u201d\n\nWalsh began by explaining that she wrote her critique of Klein because \u201cI woke up Monday morning in a changed America. We had gone from nonstop coverage, and I thought appropriate coverage, of the constitutional crisis that the Republican party had brought us to, the brink of global economic disaster. And suddenly, the disaster was the website of the Affordable Care Act, which is not the Affordable Care Act. It is only a part of it, the President was right to say that.\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cAnd I saw a kind of piling on, including by liberals, and I really \u2014 I didn\u2019t do many of the things I\u2019m accused of. I didn\u2019t say don\u2019t report on these things. I didn\u2019t say don\u2019t talk about them. I said, have a sense of perspective. This may doom the program, but it\u2019s way too early. And I think that was read as I was somehow a prop for Obama.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd of course, I am the last person,\u201d Walsh added, then paused. \u201cNot the last person\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not the last person,\u201d a smiling Hayes agreed.\n\n\u201cNot the last person. Good call,\u201d Walsh said. \u201cBut, you know, people who are devotees of our President are sitting in their living rooms saying \u2018She\u2019s no Obama-bot.\u201d\n\nThey were probably also thinking \u201cWhy did I just call myself an \u2018Obama-bot\u2019 in my own thoughts? That was weird.\u201d\n\nKlein explained, at length, that reporting on the issue is necessary and important, because the problems run deeper than just the website. \u201cWhen you call the health care system on the phone, when you call Obamacare on the phone and try to sign up, they are sending that information about you through the computer system to the insurance company, and that isn\u2019t working,\u201d Klein explained, adding \u201cthat\u2019s why this is a really big deal.\u201d\n\nso what\u2019s your response to that?\n\nWalsh responded by explaining the benefits of the law, and adding that \u201cA lot of people are frustrated but hanging in, because they desperately need health insurance. They\u2019re going to get it. It may be a complete disaster down the road, but we\u2019re not there yet.\u201d\n\nThen, Walsh went in for the kill. \u201cI guess, Ezra, what I would say to you is you\u2019re a wonderful reporter,\u201d she said. \u201cI read you every day. I probably read close to every word you write.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a brutal takedown,\u201d Hayes cut in. \u201cContinue.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m toast,\u201d Klein said.\n\n\u201cBut it was your tone, and I think what people trust about you is your sobriety,\u201d Walsh continued. \u201cPeople think you\u2019re a liberal, and that\u2019s because reality has a well known liberal bias. But you do your job and I appreciate that. I just felt like live-blogging your attempt to reach somebody on the phone and complaining about the lack of hold music crossed the line.\u201d\n\nKlein explained that \u201cWhen I called the system, it\u2019s because President was saying call the system that day. The system dropped the call twice because it was so overwhelmed. I am trying through this reportage to convince people, to persuade them something has gone wrong here.\u201d\n\nBoth Klein and Walsh make, and miss, important points. Klein\u2019s obervation about the hold music got a lot of attention because it was petty and trivial, but the real problem was that it was shallow. I called three times this week, and the hold music was working just fine. Call centers measure performance through a variety of metrics, but two key ones are call answer times, and hold times. As Klein can attest, the calls were being answered promptly, within ten seconds each time I called, but their internal systems were locked up due to the volume. One way to manage long hold times is to ask a caller to hold, but press \u201cmute\u201d instead of using the \u201chold\u201d button. The software that call centers use to track these metrics still registers that as \u201ctalk time.\u201d\n\nKlein is correct, though, that this snafu is a big deal, and sugarcoating the problem only feeds the failure of imagination that led to this problem in the first place. Reporting on the tremendous good that the law does at the same time, as Walsh suggests, should increase the pressure on President Obama to fix this, not ease it. The best way for reporters to keep from becoming useful idiots for the right is to make the stakes for the Affordable Care Act\u2019s success inextricable from reporting on its failures.\n\nHere\u2019s the clip, from MSNBC:\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "A roiling blood feud between Salon's Joan Walsh and The Washington Post's Ezra Klein came to a bone-crunching head Wednesday night, as All In host Chris Hayes", "generator": "WordPress 2016.21", "og": {"image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/joanezra.jpg", "title": "Chris Hayes Referees \u2018Brutal Takedown\u2019 of Ezra Klein by Joan Walsh"}, "twitter": {"description": "A roiling blood feud between Salon's Joan Walsh and The Washington Post's Ezra Klein came to a bone-crunching head Wednesday night, as All In host Chris Hayes mediated an epic rhetorical steel cage match between the duo.
