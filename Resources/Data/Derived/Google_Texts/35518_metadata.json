Obama\u2019s critics have, since the ACA\u2019s creation, warned that the law would drive up the cost of insurance \u2013 now critics have been proven correct.\n\n\u201cAmong men, the county with the greatest increase in insurance prices from 2013 to 2014 was Buchanan County, Missouri, about 45 miles north of Kansas City: 271 percent,\u201d according to Forbes\u2019 number cruncher Avik Roy.\n\nHis overall analysis of 3,137 counties found Obamacare increased individual-market premiums by an average of 49 percent. The numbers were culled using Forbes\u2019 national rate navigator, which allows people to see what Obamacare is doing to insurance rates in their section of the country.\n\nIn short, the cost of health care more than tripled over the course of a year, leading some to question whether the cost might be higher for a young professional just out of college.\n\nObamacare advocates have argued that expanding Medicaid can stem the skyrocketing cost of health care.\n\nTo wit, earlier this year, the University of Missouri reported that Missouri would lose out on $1.13 billion in federal funding to expand Medicaid \u2013 and thereby fully implementing Obamacare in the state this year to an additional 300,000 Missourians. The University of Missouri used research from a University of Missouri School of Medicine 2012 policy analysis to generate those numbers.\n\nAccording to Sidney Watson, a professor at Saint Louis University\u2019s School of Law and a health care specialist, the expansion \u201cwould have created 24,000 new jobs and saved hundreds of others.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot passing this will also very severely hurt our economy, leading to lost jobs and economic activity \u2014 we have already seen over 1,000 jobs lost and more jobs will be lost,\u201d Tim McBride, health policy analyst and professor at Washington University, also told the St. Louis Business Journal.\n\nBut in reality, the cost of Medicaid expansion to the state of Missouri, Ishmael posits, in the event that it passes, would be a loser for state\u2019s taxpayers and recipients in general.\n\nIndeed, according to a blog post by the Show-Me Institute, the Kaiser Family Foundation found that if Missouri had expanded Medicaid under the ACA, \u201cthe state would spend more than $1 billion between 2013 and 2022 on just the newly eligible enrollees. In addition, the state would spend another $1.6 billion over that period on currently eligible enrollees who would come into the program as a result of the government\u2019s enrollment push.\u201d\n\nCollege Fix contributor Christopher White is a University of Missouri graduate student and an editorial assistant for The College Fix.\n\nLike The College Fix on Facebook / Follow us on Twitter\n\nIMAGE: Generation Opportunity", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The College Fix", "description": "Indeed, Missouri has the highest insurance rate increases for young men in the country.", "title": "Obamacare Hikes Insurance Rate by 411 Percent for Missouri's Male Millennials - The College Fix", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 480, "identifier": "http://www.thecollegefix.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/UncleSam.GenerationOpportunity.jpg", "height": 360}, "updated_time": "2015-05-28T17:36:29-04:00", "url": "http://www.thecollegefix.com/post/18400/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.thecollegefix.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/UncleSam.GenerationOpportunity.jpg", "description": "Indeed, Missouri has the highest insurance rate increases for young men in the country.", "card": "summary", "title": "Obamacare Hikes Insurance Rate by 411 Percent for Missouri's Male Millennials - The College Fix"}, "fb": {"admins": "672627547,1540010264,100009162449428", "app_id": 1559699120988871}, "article": {"section": "Featured", "tag": "university of missouri", "published_time": "2014-07-13T22:09:57-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-28T17:36:29-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc018\"", "article_summary": "Show-Me Institute policy analyst Patrick Ishmael, using a Forbes\u2019 insurance rate aggregator, found that a 27 year-old man in Buchanan County can expect an individual insurance policy rate increase of a whopping 411 percent, a number likely to increase for those younger than 27.\nIndeed, Missouri has the highest insurance rate increases for young men in the country, Forbes reports.\nThe University of Missouri used research from a University of Missouri School of Medicine 2012 policy analysis to generate those numbers.\nObama\u2019s critics have, since the ACA\u2019s creation, warned that the law would drive up the cost of insurance \u2013 now critics have been proven correct.\nObamacare advocates have argued that expanding Medicaid can stem the skyrocketing cost of health care."}
