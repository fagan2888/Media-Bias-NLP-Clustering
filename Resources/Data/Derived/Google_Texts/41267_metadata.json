Boyd said in an email to trustees provided to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram that \u201c\u2026 the Sante Fe community has helped me to realize that the timing is not right and that we need to continue forward and not lose momentum for the sake of our children.\u201d\n\nThe FWISD board voted 7-0, with two absent trustees, to select Boyd as the sole finalist. The search pool was narrowed to three candidates and a backup. The other two candidates withdrew their applications \u2013 one took another job and a second dropped out after news leaked to his board that he had interviewed in Fort Worth. Boyd was left as the sole finalist.\n\nThe Star-Telegram reported that four trustees were having second thoughts about Boyd being chosen.\n\nTrustee Ann Sutherland issued a statement Friday saying that though Boyd\u2019s performance during his final interview was \u201coutstanding,\u201d a post-interview examination of his tenure in Sante Fe revealed tension between teachers and Boyd.\n\n\u201cThere have been many teacher resignations, including one of a nationally recognized teacher, as well as at least one major walk-out by students in protest over his testing regimen,\u201d she said. \u201cAnecdotal comments from the community also report that he has treated teachers with unusual disrespect, including (a) entering classrooms and criticizing teachers in front of students and (b) during meetings with teacher representatives, banging on the table, talking on his cell phone and making other disrespectful gestures.\u201d\n\nSutherland said she believed Boyd\u2019s management pattern was counter to Fort Worth\u2019s needs and said she would vote \u201cno\u201d on a motion to hire him.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDE1LzAyL3NvbGUtZmluYWxpc3Qtd2l0aGRyYXdzLWNhbmRpZGFjeS1mb3ItZm9ydC13b3J0aC1pc2Qtc3VwZXJpbnRlbmRlbnQtcG9zaXRpb24uaHRtbC8=", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Claire Z.
