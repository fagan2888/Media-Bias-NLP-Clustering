Others raised their bicycles. Some looked for the nearest hug.\n\nMerely training for the annual tour through Colorado\u2019s Rocky Mountains is alone an achievement. Overcoming the physical, mental and emotional challenges to finish the event can be a life-changer, according to RTR tour director Chandler Smith.\n\nBut no cyclist can do it alone. And nowhere is that more evident than at the RTR aid stations, where a cadre of volunteers, vendors and technicians combine to provide oases every 15 or so miles along the course.\n\nIncluded in the $500 registration fee are aid-station staples: portable toilets, fruit (oranges, grapes, bananas), snacks (pretzels, animal crackers), water, various flavors of Gatorade.\n\nAlso, at each aid station is a bike-tech tent, where cyclists can find free service as well as purchase parts. For instance, first-time RTR cyclist Meredith Martin of Brooklyn, N.Y., had two tires replaced (not tubes, tires) free of labor charges between the start Tuesday in Steamboat Springs and Aid 2 that same day.\n\nThen there are the food vendors \u2014 mainstays, first-timers and one-timers \u2014 who sell everything from pancakes to tacos to veggie wraps to slices of walnut pie.\n\nA look-see:\n\nBryan Boyle: 303-954-1311, @boyle or bboyle@denverpost.com", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Chandler Smith,cyclists,mountains,Ride the Rockies,Ride the Rockies 2014,Tennessee Pass", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "Ride the Rockies", "description": "At Ride The Rockies aid stations, a cadre of volunteers, vendors and technicians combine to create oases for cyclists every 15 or so miles along the course.", "title": "Ride The Rockies 2014 cycling tour sure knows how to throw a pit stop", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/ridetherockies/2014/06/15/ode-aid-ride-rockies-tour-sure-knows-throw-pit-stop/2867/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/ridetherockies/files/2014/06/aid-2-495x369.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "At Ride The Rockies aid stations, a cadre of volunteers, vendors and technicians combine to create oases for cyclists every 15 or so miles along the course.", "creator": "@boyle", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/ridetherockies/2014/06/15/ode-aid-ride-rockies-tour-sure-knows-throw-pit-stop/2867/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/ridetherockies/files/2014/06/aid-2-495x369.jpg", "title": "Ode to aid: Ride The Rockies cycling tour sure knows how to throw a pit stop", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "At Ride The Rockies aid stations, a cadre of volunteers, vendors and technicians combine to create oases for cyclists every 15 or so miles along the course."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8a75\"", "article_summary": "Overcoming the physical, mental and emotional challenges to finish the event can be a life-changer, according to RTR tour director Chandler Smith.\nAlso, at each aid station is a bike-tech tent, where cyclists can find free service as well as purchase parts.\nMerely training for the annual tour through Colorado\u2019s Rocky Mountains is alone an achievement.\nAs the cyclists of Ride The Rockies \u2014 2,000 in all \u2014 crossed the finish line Friday under the iconic arch in downtown Golden on the sixth and final day of the tour of 450-plus miles, some raised their hands.\nThen there are the food vendors \u2014 mainstays, first-timers and one-timers \u2014 who sell everything from pancakes to tacos to veggie wraps to slices of walnut pie."}
