Welcome to the 2014 State & National Group Leadership Summit.\n\nAnd a special welcome to the staff and volunteers who traveled from every corner of the country \u2013 and beyond \u2013 to be here this week.\n\nI\u2019d like to begin my remarks by talking a little about disruption \u2013 something you\u2019re going to hear about during this summit.\n\nThese days, you can\u2019t pick up an industry publication, attend a conference, or follow your Twitter feed without hearing about the disruption economy \u2026 technology disruption \u2026 business disruption \u2026 social disruption \u2026\n\nI recently heard someone use the term \u2018disruptive disruption\u2019 \u2026 what does that even mean?\n\nAs Judith Shulevitz of the New Republic said:\n\nSometimes buzzwords become so pervasive, they\u2019re almost inaudible \u2013 which is when we need to start listening to them \u2026 disruptive is like that.\n\nIn our fast-moving, fast-changing and unpredictable world, there are disruptive events that have an outsize influence on the way we live, the way we work.\n\nAnd nobody knows this better than all of you.\n\nBecause AARP is at the epicenter of one of the most disruptive events of our time \u2013 the aging of America.\n\nOn Jan. 1, 1946, the first of 78 million baby boomers was born \u2026 and on January 2011, those boomers began turning 65 \u2013 representing the most significant demographic shift in our nation\u2019s history.\n\nEvery seven seconds, someone turns 50 \u2026 12,500 people every day.\n\nBy 2030, 1 in 3 Americans will be over the age of 50 \u2013 and the 65-plus population will double to 72 million.\n\nAnd this isn\u2019t a passing trend.\n\nWhen you look at the sheer numbers of boomers, Gen Xers and the millennials behind them \u2013 and when you consider how long these folks will live \u2013 simply put, America will be an older country from here on out.\n\nThink of the magnitude of this shift for AARP.\n\nToday, our 50-plus constituency is 109 million strong.\n\nIn just 15 years, the number of people 50-plus will increase to 132 million!!\n\nAs America grows older, it will be a different kind of older \u2013 different than previous generations.\n\nFor one, the face of aging literally looks different.\n\nWhile the Silent Generation was by and large homogenous, not so for the generations that followed.\n\nAccording to the latest Census, the 65-plus population will nearly double to 40 percent minority in 2050.\n\nAnother significant difference between us and our forebears is that we\u2019re living longer \u2013 the average life expectancy in the U.S. is up to 78 years, a full 13 years beyond traditional retirement age.\n\nRather than just lengthening extreme old age, the 30 years we\u2019ve added to our lifespans in the past century resulted in a much longer middle age \u2013 meaning that we\u2019re adding healthy years, not debilitated ones.\n\nWe\u2019ve even developed a new mindset about aging \u2013 it\u2019s called denial.\n\nAs Nora Ephron said: \u201cThere\u2019s a reason why forty, fifty, and sixty don\u2019t look the way they used to \u2013 and it\u2019s not because of feminism, or better living through exercise. It\u2019s because of hair dye.\u201d\n\nAmid this great age wave, society is responding, adapting and changing \u2013 creating new rules and placing new expectations on people, on families.\n\nIndividuals have to figure out what to do with the two or three decades that their grandparents didn\u2019t have.\n\nYou could say that this is the era of the individual \u2013 when everyone gets to be \u201cCEO of my life.\u201d\n\nIn some ways, this is a luxury. But in many ways, it\u2019s also a burden.\n\nMore and more, there is increased responsibility on people to navigate this new life stage:\n\n\u2026 from figuring out how to make limited retirement savings last;\n\n\u2026 to understanding an increasingly complicated health care system;\n\n\u2026 to reinventing themselves to stay relevant and wanted in the workplace \u2013 at a time when age discrimination is prevalent.\n\n\u2026 to serving as an emotional adviser, caregiver and financial resource to children, parents and grandparents.\n\nIt goes without saying that the aging of the United States has significant implications for the people we represent, and enormous consequences for our organization \u2013 because AARP\u2019s agenda, and our entire body of work, is devoted to improving society so that people can age with dignity, with independence and with purpose.\n\nIn SNG, we live and breathe these demographics.\n\nWe see the statistics of demography come to life in our everyday work, and through the individuals who engage with us.\n\nThey come to our programs. They support our advocacy. They volunteer with us. They raise their voices. They tell us what they want and what they need.\n\nAt AARP, we know the issues \u2013 and the people \u2013 intimately.\n\nAnd we know that the aging of America \u2013 indeed, this new way of aging \u2013 will have profound implications for society \u2013 not just for individuals, but also for major institutions.\n\nJust look at the institution of government \u2013 which has been deeply involved in the business of aging ever since Social Security was created in 1935.\n\nThe sheer numbers of boomers will present challenges to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid \u2013 programs that are central to the health and retirement security of millions of older Americans.\n\nFor four years \u2013 since Simpson and Bowles issued their report in 2010 \u2013 Washington has been locked in a pernicious conversation, with a frame that is born of spreadsheets and numbers\n\n\u2026 a frame that ignores the economic struggles of so many Americans; a frame that pits generation against generation.\n\nThrough You\u2019ve Earned a Say, we\u2019ve been pushing for a different conversation \u2013 about real people and their families.\n\nWe need to talk about quality of life, about empowerment and support.\n\nFor Social Security, we need a debate with all decision makers around the table \u2013 Republicans, Democrats and the president.\n\nThe debate should focus on responsible solutions that will keep the promise to current seniors, and strengthen the program for future generations.\n\nAt the same time, we need a broader debate about what it will take to ensure that people have financial security and savings for their 70s, their 80s, their 90s.\n\nIt\u2019s not just about making it to retirement. It\u2019s about making it through retirement.\n\nHealth care will be more complicated.\n\nThe rapidly increasing number of older Americans has far-reaching implications for our nation\u2019s public health system \u2013 and will place unprecedented demands on the provision of health care and aging-related services.\n\nMedicare is obviously critical for more than 50 million beneficiaries \u2013 but it\u2019s also a key indicator and driver for the entire health care system.\n\nWe must stabilize Medicare for future generations, continue to look for efficiencies and opportunities to drive down costs, and keep the promise we\u2019ve made to seniors by pushing for responsible, commonsense solutions.\n\nAt the same time, we need to better understand the Affordable Care Act and what it means for the future of health care in America.\n\nThere has been so much attention on getting the ACA website and exchanges up and running; we\u2019re just beginning to unpack how dramatically it will influence the delivery of care.\n\nUndoubtedly, our federal government plays a major role.\n\nState and local governments also play an important and evolving role \u2013 from delivering and supporting long term care, to enhancing public health, to ensuring that our infrastructure is able to support the needs of a changing constituency, to serving as guinea pigs and laboratories for innovations in personal saving.\n\nUnfortunately, while demand for government services is on the rise, federal and state budgets continue to suffer in the wake of the recession \u2013 and there are limited resources to go around.\n\nAARP\u2019s job is to make sure that our public officials make the best use of those resources.\n\nOur job is to push them to champion new solutions that address new challenges.\n\nOur job is to make sure that today\u2019s older Americans \u2013 and tomorrow\u2019s older Americans \u2013 are not ignored \u2026 are not forgotten \u2026 because we cannot allow ourselves to revert to a modern-day version of our founder Ethel Percy Andrus\u2019 friend, who lived in a chicken coop.\n\nAt the same time, we need to create, and participate in, a real dialogue about intergenerational fairness.\n\nThere is a small \u2013 but very loud \u2013 group of opinion leaders in this country who have created a polarizing narrative about intergenerational warfare \u2013 about generations robbing other generations.\n\nThis is an overly simplistic and false picture.\n\nInstead of helping us come together to solve our country\u2019s problems, this narrative pushes us farther apart.\n\nWe need a conversation that reflects the complexities and nuances of how generations work together, live together, support one another:\n\n\u2026 a conversation that considers that more than 6 in 10 grandparents provided financial assistance or monetary gifts to their grandchildren in the past five years;\n\n\u2026 a conversation that recognizes that almost 3 in 10 adults between the ages of 40 and 59 are providing primary financial support to a child 18 years or older;\n\n\u2026 a conversation that appreciates that the average family caregiver spends $5,531 or more in a year on expenses to care for their family member.\n\nClearly, older Americans and boomers are committed to family.\n\nTheir legacy is not to amass wealth or to take away from the health and prosperity of our nation \u2013 their legacy is to leave a positive, lasting impact on society for their kids, grandkids and future generations.\n\nSo absolutely, let\u2019s talk about generations and intergenerational fairness \u2013 but let\u2019s have a real conversation that reflects the real America that we all know.\n\nWith increasing demand and limited resources, we can expect added pressure on the social sector \u2013 nonprofits and charities alike \u2013 to help fill the gap.\n\nOf course, nonprofits face the same squeeze as government: Resources are scarce.\n\nAnd there will be even more pressure on organizations like AARP to bring resources together in a more efficient, more systemic way.\n\nWhile nonprofits may be strapped for cash, there is some good news.\n\nThe aging of America has given us an enormous reservoir of volunteer talent \u2013 millions of individuals who bring decades of life and work experience, commitment and passion.\n\nBoomers have the highest volunteer rate of any age group \u2013 indeed, more than 33 million people over the age of 45 volunteered their time and skills in 2012.\n\nIn order to take advantage of this talent, nonprofits will need to change the way they attract, train and retain their volunteers.\n\nAnd they will need to redefine, renew and rethink volunteers for a new era.\n\nThere will be significant competition for this \u201carmy of useful citizens.\u201d\n\nAARP must continue to adapt, change and innovate in our quest for volunteers \u2013 because we cannot deliver on our mission without them.\n\nAs the nonprofit community looks at boomers and sees potential volunteers, businesses and marketers are finally starting to see potential customers.\n\nAnd they would be remiss not to \u2013 because aging boomers represent a powerful opportunity.\n\nIndeed, it\u2019s hard to ignore the unprecedented, collective wealth of the boomers \u2013 which far surpasses any generation before them.\n\nIn 2010, disposable income for Americans 50-plus was over $3 trillion.\n\nAs a group, the over-50 crowd controls almost 80 percent of U.S. aggregate net worth.\n\nHistorically, businesses and marketers have chosen to target the younger in lieu of the older \u2013 Nielsen estimates that less than 5 percent of advertising dollars are geared to people 35-64.\n\nBut savvy businesses, investors and marketers are beginning to give older consumers the attention they deserve.\n\nIn boomers, they see a market opportunity \u2013 they see the \u201clongevity economy.\u201d\n\nAARP\u2019s challenge \u2013 indeed, our opportunity \u2013 is to figure out where we can put our stamp on the market, which will respond to the aging of America with our without us.\n\nWe must determine where we can influence, where we can insert ourselves, and how we can move the market to better serve our constituency.\n\nLook at what we did with KB Home, one of the largest homebuilders in the nation.\n\nWe encouraged them to market a suite of products \u2013 which they call \u201csimply living\u201d \u2013 to bring greater attention to universal design features that help people age in place.\n\nSure, KB is a socially responsible company. But they\u2019re also focused on the bottom line \u2013 and they recognize the power of the boomer market.\n\nOf course, businesses will have to adapt in more ways than one \u2013 not just to market forces, but also to the changing nature of their workforce \u2013 and their role as employer.\n\nTalent recruitment, management and development is a unifying factor that cuts across major institutions.\n\nAs the population ages, so too does the American workforce \u2013 whether it\u2019s nurses, retail workers or, yes, even the New York Yankees \u2026\n\nAlthough some people will retire with decent pensions, many will continue to work.\n\nSome will work because they want to, most because they have to \u2013 50 percent of nonretired boomers have little confidence they will ever be able to retire.\n\nIn a nutshell, there\u2019s a new word for retirement: It\u2019s called \u201cwork.\u201d\n\nJust as the inclusion of women changed the workplace in the 20th century, the aging population will certainly change the workplace in the 21st century.\n\nFor the first time in modern history, the workplace spans four generations \u2013 with 20-year-olds working side-by-side with 70-year-olds.\n\nAnd despite the pervasive myth about older workers taking away jobs, the truth is: There\u2019s room for everyone.\n\nIn a report entitled \u201cAre Aging Baby Boomers Squeezing Young Workers Out of Jobs?\u201d the Center for Retirement Research found no evidence that increasing the employment of older persons reduces the job opportunities or wage rates of younger persons.\n\nBoomers make up about one-third of the U.S. workforce, and employers must develop new policies and practices to meet the changing wants and needs of older workers \u2013 a highly educated, capable and sizable segment of the workforce.\n\nAnd businesses must figure out how to offer more flexibility, as more and more people face caregiving responsibilities.\n\nSome employers are ahead of the curve, because they recognize the value of an age-diverse workforce.\n\nUnfortunately, some employers don\u2019t share that sentiment.\n\nAge discrimination remains a significant barrier to many older Americans who want to keep their jobs, or to get new jobs.\n\nAnd yet, in our legal system, age is the easiest form of discrimination \u2013 which is why we\u2019re working so hard to remedy the Supreme Court decision that made it almost impossible for victims of discrimination to have any kind of recourse.\n\nAnd as we wage this fight, we continue to face significant resistance from the business lobby.\n\nWe want to level the playing field, because we believe that no one\u2019s possibilities should ever be limited by their age.\n\nAARP has a long history in the older worker arena \u2013 serving as a resource to both individuals and employers, and as an advocate for those folks who need an ally.\n\nAs we build out our new enterprise effort on work and jobs, we will look to replicate tried-and-true strategies, at the same time that we look for new ones.\n\nAnd finally, I want to mention one more institution that spans public and private, for-profit and nonprofit \u2013 the built environment.\n\nJust as people are aging in place, communities are also \u2013 by and large \u2013 aging in place.\n\nUnlike Jerry Seinfeld\u2019s parents who famously moved to Florida, today\u2019s 50-plus are staying put \u2013 83 percent of boomers expect to stay in the very same house when they retire.\n\nIn essence, they are opting for friends and grandkids over palm trees and putt-putt.\n\nCities and communities will be challenged with responding to the wants and needs of an age-diverse constituency.\n\nBased on our research with Governing magazine, we know that states and communities are largely unprepared for the massive demographic shift.\n\nMany people indicate that they lack the kind of access and proximity to the services they want and need as they get older, their homes are not conducive to aging in place, and they don\u2019t have transit and transportation options to get around their community.\n\nThat said, there are pockets of progress and innovation across the country.\n\nCommunities \u2013 large and small \u2013 are taking action because it\u2019s the right thing to do, and because it\u2019s good for economic development.\n\nFortunately for AARP, we have been on the vanguard of this movement.\n\nAnd I can safely say that we are the only organization that is making the connection between aging communities and livable communities.\n\nSo these are just five sectors \u2013 but we know that every part of our country and our economy will be impacted by, and play a role in, the aging of America.\n\nFrom design to health care to education \u2026 no corner of society will go untouched.\n\nAt the same time that we look at major institutions, we can\u2019t lose sight of the fact that some of the most interesting and innovative things are happening from the ground up.\n\nWhen people don\u2019t have access to societal or structural supports, they will create them.\n\nLook at the growing number of Americans who are moving into group houses for mutual support \u2013 and I\u2019m not talking about Jennifer Aniston and Courteney Cox. I\u2019m talking about Bea Arthur and Betty White.\n\nLook at what\u2019s happened with the naturally occurring retirement communities, where neighbors are working with neighbors to ensure their community has the services and amenities that help them age in place.\n\nAnd we\u2019ve seen the power of the people through the explosion of crowdfunding. The company Kickstarter has already channeled more than $1 billion in pledges from 5.7 million donors to fund 135,000 creative projects.\n\nJust as states and communities are laboratories for innovation, so too are the citizens \u2013 and volunteers! \u2013 who band together to bring about change.\n\nIn closing, I want you to know that AARP and our members are counting on all of you.\n\nWe have an ambitious agenda. We have so much that we need to deliver this year, next year and in the years to come.\n\nMake no mistake. The challenges are great:\n\n\u2026 individuals are not prepared for the future, and they are entering their 50s less financially secure;\n\n\u2026 institutions are adapting at varying rates, with varying degrees of success;\n\n\u2026 policies and programs are built for the 20th century \u2013 not for 2020, 2030 and beyond.\n\nAnd this is where AARP comes in.\n\nWe are at the nexus of the individual and the institution.\n\nWe have the experience, the resources, the clout and, most importantly, the leadership to play a pivotal role in the aging of America.\n\nWe must take advantage of opportunities to shape the conversation \u2013 to shape the market \u2013 to shape the policies and practices of government, businesses, employers and nonprofits alike.\n\nAt the same time, we must continue to develop new tools, new resources and new channels to help individuals navigate the opportunities and challenges that come with age.\n\nWhen future historians look back on the first half of the 21st century, they will judge today\u2019s leaders on how we responded to the challenges, and seized the advantages, of our aging country for the benefit of today\u2019s generations, and for generations to come.\n\nAnd you all are those leaders.\n\nI don\u2019t believe there is any nonprofit \u2013 indeed, any organization in America \u2013 that has the opportunity we have to help society respond to the aging of our country.\n\nAnd while demography may dictate part of our destiny, the rest is up to us.\n\nI hope you have a wonderful few days.\n\nThank you.", "article_metadata": {"page_title": "blog", "twitter": {"description": "AARP Executive Vice President Nancy LeaMond delivered the following speech on the impact of an aging America on individuals and institutions in an address to AARP staff and volunteers this morning: \u00a0 Impact of an Aging America on Major Institutions Good morning.
