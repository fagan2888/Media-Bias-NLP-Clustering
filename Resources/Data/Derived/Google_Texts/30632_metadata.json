With Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton now publicly opposed to yet another major Obama-Biden administration policy \u2013 the 12 nation Trans Pacific Partnership trade agreement \u2013 the president is surely signing the lyrics:\n\n\u201cCan I get a witness, can I get a witness, can I get a witness. Somebody!\u201d\n\nThe president must be wondering whether Joe Biden\u2019s reluctance to run is due to a sense that being the most pro-Obama candidate is a losing image. He can laugh off Drudge, Rush Limbaugh and Donald Trump saying it.\n\nBut now this?\n\nHillary and Bernie have thrown down the gauntlet to Joe, daring him to run as the most pro-Obama guy in the race. The trade pact is only the latest shot across the Obama-Biden administration\u2019s bow. There are key differences on ObamaCare, Middle East policy, engaging the Russians and more.\n\nIt is useful to put the current Democratic nomination fight in historical perspective. Unless Biden enters the fray, Democrats are poised to make modern political history: they will nominate a presidential candidate running on a platform openly opposed to key policies of the party\u2019s sitting president.\n\nThe contest 120 years ago presents the closest analogy. Little- known former Nebraska Congressman William Jennings Bryan scored an upset victory at the 1896 Democratic National Convention. The party\u2019s newly minted presidential nominee won by promising to oppose sitting Democratic President Grover Cleveland\u2019s policy of tying the dollar\u2019s value to the price of gold. He blamed lingering woes felt middle class families from the 1893 Depression on Cleveland\u2019s policy.\n\n2016 Election Headquarters The latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name in politics. See Latest Coverage \u2192\n\nIn 1896, Democrats were desperate for a winning strategy. Since the Republican Party\u2019s founding in 1854, they had been unable to secure the popular vote majority that would be needed to win the expected two-way race.\n\nAs 2016 approaches, Democrats confront a totally different presidential election landscape. They have won the popular vote 5 of the last 6 times. President Obama is the first Democratic president to win his two consecutive terms by a popular vote majority since 1936. Republican candidate George Bush won 271 electoral votes, barely more than the required 270. His meager 50.7 percent re-election winning total is worst for any two-term Republican president ever.\n\nPresidential politics is not shuffleboard, winning requires making tough choices. It is no coincidence Mrs. Clinton reversed her stand \u2013 although brilliantly nuanced -- on the trade deal right before Vice President Biden is expected to decide on his political future. The same for her decision to oppose the Keystone Pipeline.\n\nI get it: Hillary and Bernie are daring Joe to run and defend not only the trade deal, but other key Obama-Biden policies the two front-runners are opposing. The polls show these policies are not popular among likely primary voters.\n\nBut there is a fine presidential campaign line between having honest differences with President Obama on certain issues and being seen as expediently being anti-Obama, using him as a political dart board for political self-interest.\n\nIn the fog of political battle, this line can become invisible, only seen when the smoke clears. Has it been crossed and if so, what are the consequences, if any, in key electoral states where economic prosperity relies heavily on trade? It is an open question right now.\n\nBut this much is known: Hillary and Bernie have thrown down the gauntlet to Joe, daring him to run as the most pro-Obama guy in the race.\n\nThe trade pact is only the latest shot across the Obama-Biden administration\u2019s bow. There are key differences on Obamacare, Middle East policy, engaging the Russians and more.\n\nThe last Democratic president to win back-to-back popular vote majorities is Franklin Delano Roosevelt. In 80 years, every Democratic presidential hopeful feared uttering a single word of criticism.\n\nBut roughly 8 years after President Obama won election, the leading Democratic hopefuls fear not to.\n\nSo the president understandably asks: Can I get a witness?\n\nPaul Goldman is a political strategist and a former chairman of Virginia's Democratic Party.
