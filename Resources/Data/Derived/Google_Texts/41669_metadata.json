He was 43 when he died.\n\nStraughn\u2019s inclusion in the hall of fame is a \u201cdream come true\u201d for his family, according to Straughn\u2019s 72-year-old son, Lance, who has worked tirelessly to bring recognition to his father. Straughn\u2019s pitching and hitting skills are legendary among sports writers and softball aficionados.\n\nHe once pitched a 19-inning game, fanning 47 batters in a 1-0 shutout while playing in a league in Ardmore, Oklahoma. He took the mound in a national championship game in Cincinnati, Ohio. His son still has his warm-up jacket from that contest, one of few mementos to survive a 1943 house fire.\n\nStraughn could fling a softball an estimated 100 mph. He could hurl a curve ball and a slider. Those pitches are unheard of with the enormous sphere of the softball because both require a rotation of the wrist and a downward \u201csnap\u201d from either the index or middle finger. Additionally, he pitched in an old style \u201cfigure 8\u201d rather than the \u201cwindmill\u201d motion predominate today.\n\nLance Straughn estimates his father played in 800 games during his short life. Many times, he played for more than one team at a time.\n\nWhile Straughn excelled on the softball field, he is just as well known and beloved for his contribution to scouting. He served as a Boy Scout master most of his adult life, according to his son. Straughn\u2019s wife, Lillian, was a Cub Scout den mother.\n\n\u201cKids considered him a second dad,\u201d Lance Straughn said. \u201cWe always had a lot of kids over at the house. He was a great man who cared about others and helped them whenever he could.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Chickasaw Softball Legend Considered \u2018Unhittable\u2019 Named to Okla.
