He was already in second place with Republicans in Iowa and New Hampshire, and a recent Reuters poll placed him in a dead heat with rival Jeb Bush. Now another survey, released Tuesday by USA Today, actually shows him leading Bush, 14 percent to 17 percent. A majority of Republicans, nearly 60 percent, say they have a favorable view of Trump, which is very nearly a complete turnaround from as recently as May. The whole thing \u2014 by which I mean having an overt racist take the lead because there is nothing your base loves more than an overt racist \u2014 has pretty much turned the Republican presidential race from a mere carnival of sadness into a shitshow of epic proportions.\n\nAnd this, as you may already have guessed, is why I am having such a fanfuckingtastic week.\n\nI know. There\u2019s basically zero chance that Trump will hold on to this lead for anything but a fleeting moment. I am not the first to recognize that we only have to look back as far as 2012 for examples of other early GOP primary front runners \u2014 Michelle Bachmann, Herman Cain \u2014 who ultimately turned up the crazy so deafeningly loud that even Republicans were forced to change the station. Almost three-quarters of Americans polled say they essentially regard Trump\u2019s candidacy as a tasteless joke. (Were he not Canadian, we could probably put Neil Young in that camp, judging by the fact that he told Trump to stop using his music and then turned right around and told Bernie Sanders to turn that shit up.) Even Trump\u2019s flimsy lead in the aforementioned poll falls within the margin of error.\n\nBut for a second, let\u2019s stop trafficking in reality. For just a moment, join me in the hope that this terrible and actual human nightmare will hang in there for as long as possible. Because if there was ever any question about the values the modern Republican party holds dear \u2014 racism, xenophobia, anti-intellectualism and garden-variety lunacy\u2014 Donald Trump, a bullhorn with a comb-over, is ready to shout it at the top of his lungs.\n\nThe other Republican contenders may play to the same ugly ideas, but they cloak their language (although only just barely) to disguise it as something else. Rick Santorum, in the aftermath of the Charleston shooting and the repeated refrain to take down the Confederate flag, speaks substantively to neither issue but instead talks about \u201cstates rights\u201d and suggests that the way to end racism is to shutter Planned Parenthood. Bobby Jindal defends anti-gay and racist remarks with drivel about constitutional rights, but then decides Article Three \u2014 the one establishing the Supreme Court \u2014 should be scuttled when SCOTUS makes marriage equality the law of the land. Ben Carson says political correctness under Obama has made America \u201cvery much like Nazi Germany\u201d and the Affordable Care Act is \u201cthe worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery.\u201d Ted Cruz actually calls the consecutive days on which SCOTUS upholds healthcare and marriage equality \u201csome of the darkest 24 hours in our nation\u2019s history.\u201d Scott Walker implies gay people are child sexual predators and tries to make poverty as humiliating and punitive as possible by fighting to drug-test food stamp recipients. And Rick \u201cForgetful Jones\u201d Perry just executes people \u2014 a fact that, you might recall, Republicans actually cheered him for. We could do this for all eleventy thousand Republican candidates, but I\u2019m sure you already get the picture.\n\nWith Trump, though, there\u2019s nothing to decode in his speeches, no dog whistles you have to strain to hear; it\u2019s all loud and wrong and right there on the record, with no pretense of being anything but ugly and hateful. When Trump offers his thoughts on Mexican immigrants, he is clear and direct about the fact that this is what he truly believes. When he sends the press an 881-word essay saying that \u201cthe worst elements in Mexico are being pushed into the United States by the Mexican government,\u201d and that \u201ctremendous infectious disease is pouring across the border,\u201d he is telling us, in no uncertain terms, that this is how he thinks. When he retweets supporters that Jeb Bush \u201chas to like Mexican illegals because of his wife,\u201d or that he should \"Get to The WHITE House\" (you know, to reclaim it from the black people currently living in it), he is sending a resounding message about who he is. Likewise, when Republicans applaud Trump for his honesty or claim he\u2019s speaking for the American people, they too are telling us that Trump is expressing exactly what they think. Only out loud. And without the big show of pretending to be a decent human being that his competitors put on.\n\nFor this, the GOP base loves him \u2014 because of the disgusting and hopelessly misinformed things he\u2019s saying. Remember, this is the same absurd caricature who wouldn't shut up about Obama\u2019s birth certificate; who still persists in calling the fully exonerated black and Hispanic men of the Central Park 5 \u201cno angels\u201d; who was upset because a Mexican director won the Oscar this year for Best Picture. Donald Trump has always been awful and racist, but that wasn\u2019t enough, I suppose. It took him being awful and driving his racist rhetoric right to the tippity top for the Republican base to fall truly and madly for him. In a league of crazy racist xenophobes, Trump has proved himself the craziest, most racist xenophobe of all, or at least the most upfront about it. And for that, he is being rewarded by a party of people who cannot get enough. Because that\u2019s what the modern GOP is all about.\n\nSo when Lindsey Graham complains that Trump is \u201ca wrecking ball for the future of the Republican Party with the Hispanic community,\u201d I wonder where he\u2019s been for the last few years. By the same token, when John McCain \u2014 the man who gave us Sarah Effing Palin \u2014 says Trump has \u201cfired up the crazies,\u201d we can only hope some researcher out there is developing a medication for people suffering from alarmingly low levels of self-awareness. And when Carlos Curbelo, a freshman Republican congressman from Miami, suggests that Trump is some kind of liberal in disguise (\u201ca phantom candidate\u201d), shouting assbackward ideas and trolling the country to give Republicans a bad name, it seems like someone should remind him what party he belongs to and ask him what year he thinks it is. Since amnesia has to be the only excuse.\n\nAlthough I know he won\u2019t make it over the long haul, Donald Trump really is the candidate the Republican party deserves. Bereft of wit, unable to write a good comeback that doesn\u2019t just lean on calling everyone a loser, possibly inflating his personal wealth by literally billions, Trump is a total bore in so many ways. But as a true representative and reminder of what the Republican Party has come to, we can only hope he sticks around. He couldn\u2019t possibly tack to the center after all the garbage of the last few weeks, and the saner elements of the Republican Party know he\u2019d lose to Hillary, whom he currently polls 17 points behind, so it\u2019s a safe bet that donors and others will spend their money elsewhere.\n\nStill, I\u2019m keeping my fingers crossed that Donald Trump, the lone candidate to have a butt plug crafted in his image and pi\u00f1atas in his likeness, remains in the race, near the top, for as long as possible. And that he keeps right on talking. Because he\u2019s the real voice of the GOP, and it\u2019s only fair that we all get to hear it.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Every time Trump opens his mouth, he tells us everything we need to know about today's Republican party.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Alternet", "description": "Every time Trump opens his mouth, he tells us everything we need to know about today's Republican party.", "title": "Oh Please God, Let Donald Trump Keep Talking", "url": "http://www.alternet.org/news-amp-politics/oh-please-god-let-donald-trump-keep-talking", "image": "http://www.alternet.org/files/story_images/gage_skidmore_0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "dc": {"title": "Oh Please God, Let Donald Trump Keep Talking"}, "fb": {"page_id": 17108852506, "pages": 17108852506}, "google-site-verification": "-yUzdOYz6i2iShII0x_PYzsvnhQUG2f751funoPlCNM", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-17T21:05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf966\"", "article_summary": "Oh Please God, Let Donald Trump Keep TalkingDonald Trump and I are having a great week.\nAlthough I know he won\u2019t make it over the long haul, Donald Trump really is the candidate the Republican party deserves.\nDonald Trump has always been awful and racist, but that wasn\u2019t enough, I suppose.\nBut as a true representative and reminder of what the Republican Party has come to, we can only hope he sticks around.\nStill, I\u2019m keeping my fingers crossed that Donald Trump, the lone candidate to have a butt plug crafted in his image and pi\u00f1atas in his likeness, remains in the race, near the top, for as long as possible."}
