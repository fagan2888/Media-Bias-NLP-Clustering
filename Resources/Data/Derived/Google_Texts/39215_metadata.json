Cummings: 'No doubt' Cruz eyes '16\n\nRep. Elijah Cummings says on their trip to South Africa earlier this week, conversations with Sen. Ted Cruz convinced the Democrat that Cruz is \u201cdefinitely\u201d going to run for president in 2016.\n\nBoth members of Congress were part of a delegation that went to the memorial for South African leader Nelson Mandela, and Cummings, a Maryland Democrat, said while Cruz, a Republican from Texas, tried to \u201cskirt the issue,\u201d it was clear from their discussion that he wants to run.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cI have no doubt about it,\u201d Cummings said on CNN\u2019s \u201cThe Situation Room\u201d on Thursday. \u201cI asked him, was he going to New Hampshire, was he going to South Carolina, Iowa? And he said he probably would be going to all of those places and he would be doing the things that a presidential candidate would be normally doing, but he wouldn\u2019t say yes or no. But it was quite clear to me.\u201d\n\n( PHOTOS: Republicans, 2016 contenders)\n\nCummings said he didn\u2019t expect to see Cruz on the trip with so many members of the Congressional Black Caucus and that it offered the group an opportunity to talk on the long flights.\n\n\u201cI was surprised to see him on the trip. I didn\u2019t know he was going,\u201d Cummings said. \u201cAnd when I discovered him, I said, you know, this is an opportunity for members of the Congressional Black Caucus to really let him know how we feel about the issues that we are so concerned about.\u201d\n\nCruz sat next to Rep. Gwen Moore (D-Wis.), \u201cwho is not shy,\u201d Cummings said, but all two dozen lawmakers moved around during the trip and talked with one another.\n\n( PHOTOS: Key quotes from Ted Cruz)\n\n\u201cAll throughout we had plenty of time on the plane to talk, we were moving up and down the aisles, we had several stops for refueling, and then of course in Johannesburg at the event, the memorial service we again had a chance to talk,\u201d Cummings said. \u201cI noticed that John Lewis spent time talking to him, Maxine Waters and others. And it wasn\u2019t a concerted effort, it wasn\u2019t orchestrated, but I think everybody had an opportunity to actually get their point of view over to him. Whether it sinks in is a whole other thing.\u201d\n\nCummings said he and Cruz discussed Obamacare and their similar backgrounds as the sons of preachers.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "He says &quot;it was quite clear to me&quot; after their conversations during their trip to South Africa.", "title": "Cummings: 'No doubt' Cruz eyes '16", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2013/12/ted-cruz-2016-election-elijah-cummings-101120.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/news/110630_elijah_cummings_ap_328.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "South Africa (58),Elijah Cummings (75),2016 Elections (483),Elections (1925),Ted Cruz (374)", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "He says &quot;it was quite clear to me&quot; after their conversations during their trip to South Africa.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdae83\"", "article_summary": "Cummings: 'No doubt' Cruz eyes '16Rep.
