President Barack Obama delivered his State of the Union address in 2015.

Of all the guests attending tonight’s State of the Union address in Washington, D.C., a lone, empty chair in the first lady’s box may send the strongest message of the night.

Hoping to call attention to its push for tighter regulation of guns, the White House plans to leave the chair empty to represent victims of gun violence who no longer have a voice.

Also in the first lady’s box will be Staff Sgt. Spencer Stone, a US airman hailed as a hero for helping to thwart a European terror attack and who later survived a stabbing attack in his hometown of Sacramento, Calif.
