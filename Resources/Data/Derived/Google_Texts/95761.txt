Naomi Campbell to the rescue in the Nick of time: Supermodel comes to Grimshaw's aid to get us to listen in



Nick Grimshaw’s breakfast show ratings have nosedived but his appeal to celebrities wanting to take him under their wing is as strong as ever.



The latest is Naomi Campbell, who appeared on his Radio 1 show to promote her Sky modelling series The Face.

Naomi has now offered to get Nick modelling and has even agreed to play his show’s Call Or Delete game – in the hope of boosting ailing ratings.

The admiration is mutual, with Grimmy posting a picture of the pair on Twitter, above, with hearts, flowers and the message ‘Queen Bish’.

‘They are great friends now,’ says a pal. ‘Naomi’s invited him to walk for her next Fashion For Relief charity catwalk show.’

Kit spies his Hollywood chance

Rising star: Kit Harington will take the lead in a big screen version of Spooks

Game Of Thrones hunk Kit Harington has landed the leading role in a new movie version of the BBC’s spy drama Spooks.

Kit, 26, is best known for his portrayal of Jon Snow in Game Of Thrones where he romances Ygritte, played by Scottish heiress Rose Leslie, 26.

The pair became a real-life couple during filming but have since split.

Now the British star’s role as MI5 agent Will Crombie in Spooks: The Greater Good is predicted to propel him to major Hollywood stardom.

‘We are delighted that Kit, who blew us away as Jon Snow, will star in the lead role as Will Crombie,’ said producer Ollie Madden.

The film, directed by Bharat Nalluri, will begin shooting early in the New Year.



White Queen star Amanda Hale almost quit acting over pressure to do nude scenes for the BBC drama – which she flatly refused – according to tweets by her playwright pal Simon Stephens. He slammed it as ‘porno lite’.

Stephens was too discreet to name Amanda, 31, who played pious Lady Margaret Beaufort.
