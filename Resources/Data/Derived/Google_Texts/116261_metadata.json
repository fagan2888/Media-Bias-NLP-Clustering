Greg Abbott has not always lived life in a wheelchair. He was on his morning jog 31 years ago when a falling tree broke his spinal cord, leaving him partially paralyzed.\n\nAbbott, a Catholic, noted at the National Catholic Prayer Breakfast, held May 7 in Washington, there are times when \u201cour prayers are answered differently than the way we expect.\u201d\n\nHe said he can recall, \u201cI spent months praying and hoping for the best possible outcome\u201d after the accident. God, instead, \u201cresponded by giving me challenges that made me even stronger.\u201d\n\nAbbott told the audience at a Washington hotel ballroom, \u201cIn hindsight, I am tremendously thankful that God did not grant me my wish,\u201d adding, \u201cIf you had seen what I had gone through, you would never again question the Lord.\u201d\n\nAs he had in the period following his accident, \u201chave you ever noticed how our prayers increase in time of great need?\u201d asked Abbott, who had been Texas\u2019 attorney general for 12 years before becoming governor in January.\n\nHe said the United States is in such a time right now. He told of two challenges to religious liberty that Texas successfully fended off in the courts. One would have removed a monument to the Ten Commandments on government property; another would have deleted the words \u201cone nation under God\u201d from the Pledge of Allegiance.\n\nAbbott outlined three such challenges in the courts today:\n\nthe Little Sisters of the Poor\u2019s lawsuit challenging the federal Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 contraceptive mandate under the Affordable Care Act\n\nwhat he called \u201cthe never-ending battle to defend the unborn\u201d\n\nand the legal challenge to \u201cmarriage defined by God.\u201d\n\nThe Bible holds the answer to such issues, according to Abbott. \u201cGod told us what we need in this world are righteous leaders,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we close the door to the Lord, we can do nothing.\u201d\n\nBishop Richard J. Malone of Buffalo, New York, who also spoke at the breakfast, took note of \u201cthe most recent and dramatic challenges of this crisis facing our culture\u201d in the courts today, although he focused on same-sex marriage.\n\nHe lamented what might happen to children \u201cwhen creation becomes subject to human domination instead of God\u2019s stewardship.\u201d\n\nBishop Malone, chairman of the U.S. bishops\u2019 Committee on Marriage, Family Life, Women and Youth, added, \u201cThe sacrament of marriage does not replace or supplant the normal instrument of marriage, but simply fulfills it.\u201d\n\nThe church, he said, \u201crecognizes the sacrament of a natural marriage bond and insists that the human law do the same.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe call of St. John Paul II for families to \u2018become what you are'\u201d \u2014 repeating the pope\u2019s quote for emphasis \u2014 \u201cis still relevant today,\u201d Bishop Malone said.\n\n\u201cEducation and ongoing formation are urgently needed\u201d in the national marriage debate, he added.\n\nBishop Malone quoted remarks from Archbishop Joseph E. Kurtz of Louisville, Kentucky, president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, made at the recent March for Marriage when he said, \u201cThe building of a culture of marriage will take patience, persistence and courage.\u201d Bishop Malone also asked or \u201can outpouring of the Holy Spirit\u201d to aid in this work.\n\nThe National Catholic Prayer Breakfast is in its 12th year. It is generally held on the first Thursday in May, which is the National Day of Prayer, a date set in 1988 by Congress, although Congress had authorized an annual national day of prayer in 1952.\n\nIn a proclamation marking the day, President Barack Obama said, \u201cAs we join together in fellowship, we seek to see our own reflection in the struggle of others, to be our brothers\u2019 and sisters\u2019 keepers, and to keep faith \u2014 in one another, in the promise of our nation, and in the Almighty.\u201d\n\n\u2014 By Mark Pattison, Catholic News Service.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Catholic News Service", "og": {"site_name": "The Catholic Sun", "description": "\u201cIn hindsight, I am tremendously thankful that God did not grant me my wish,\u201d adding, \u201cIf you had seen what I had gone through, you would never again question the Lord.\u201d", "title": "Texas governor: Response to prayer after accident made him stronger", "url": "http://www.catholicsun.org/2015/05/07/texas-governor-response-to-prayer-after-accident-made-him-stronger/", "image": {"width": 575, "identifier": "http://www.catholicsun.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-07-at-2.00.28-PM.png", "height": 437}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.catholicsun.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-07-at-2.00.28-PM.png?w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-07T20:58:45+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-07T21:01:44+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3322\"", "article_summary": "The National Catholic Prayer Breakfast is in its 12th year.\n\u201cEducation and ongoing formation are urgently needed\u201d in the national marriage debate, he added.\n\u201cGod told us what we need in this world are righteous leaders,\u201d he said.\nHe told of two challenges to religious liberty that Texas successfully fended off in the courts.\nWASHINGTON (CNS) \u2014 Texas Gov."}
