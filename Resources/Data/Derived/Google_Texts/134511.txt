I’m glad Alice Rivlin thinks that filling the hole for those not part of an employer-sponsored health plan but too young for Medicare and not poor enough for subsidies is a resounding success under the Affordable Care Act [“The true meaning of Obamacare,” op-ed, Nov 21]. Her blithe endorsement of the health-care insurance available neglects what is really happening in the individual insurance market.

Once upon a time, my husband and I paid a comfortable $350 a month for a high-deductible, catastrophic health-care plan. That premium inched up every year as we got older, which, while annoying, was understandable. Enter the Affordable Care Act and the requirement that we buy a new plan that would “comply” with it. Our $543 monthly premium skyrocketed to $1,432 per month, an unsustainable amount for us. We had to cancel that insurance and find another plan that “only” costs $990 a month and bumps two of our three long-term doctors out of our network. This is the “true meaning” of Obamacare for us.
