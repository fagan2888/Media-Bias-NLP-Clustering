They found that the best programs include the following components:\n\nTransparency: Two programs, Aligning Forces Humboldt (Calif.) and Aligning Forces for Quality-South Central Pennsylvania, found increased transparency helped patients understand the system and how it worked, according to the brief. \"The groups have found that clear expectations, structured meetings and asking patients for feedback through meeting evaluations increases the satisfaction of both patients and clinicians,\" the brief states. Engagement: Patients involved in their own care do a better job of communicating their own needs, according to the brief. Massachusetts Health Quality Partners, which serves the greater Boston area, created the Patient and Public Engagement Council to give providers feedback and foster patient-physician relations. Collaboration: Aligning Forces Humboldt offers workshops that assist patients with management strategies for chronic conditions, such as diabetes, high cholesterol, heart conditions and obesity. \"Initially, the program relied on word-of-mouth recommendations from enthusiastic alumni, public service announcements and newspaper articles to recruit attendees,\" the brief states. \"Those efforts didn't go far enough, however, so program leaders began working with doctors' offices to refer patients with chronic illnesses.\"\n\nPatients fall in three engagement levels, according to an American Institutes for Research framework. There are first-level patients, who begin to engage in their own care; second-level patients, who actively give providers their input; and third-level patients, who work to improve care delivery at the institutional and regulatory level.\n\nPatient engagement that strengthens the doctor-patient relationship can also substantially narrow the income-based healthcare gap, FierceHealthcare previously reported.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the brief (.pdf)\n\n- here's the patient framework\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nReport: Engage low-income patients to fix income-based care gap\n\nStakeholder collaboration can reduce readmission rates\n\nBoost patient engagement with a written physician-patient pledge", "article_metadata": {"description": "Successful\u00a0patient engagement\u00a0programs require three essential components,\u00a0according to\u00a0a new brief from the\u00a0Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Successful\u00a0patient engagement\u00a0programs require three essential components,\u00a0according to\u00a0a new brief from the\u00a0Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.", "title": "3 ways to boost patient engagement", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/3-ways-boost-patient-engagement/2014-03-11", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Delivery,Patient Care & Outcomes,patient engagement,Robert Wood Johnson Foundation", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf374\"", "article_summary": "Patient engagement that strengthens the doctor-patient relationship can also substantially narrow the income-based healthcare gap, FierceHealthcare previously reported.\nSuccessful patient engagement programs require three essential components, according to a new brief from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.\nThe brief provides first-hand accounts and lessons learned from organizations that successfully implemented patient engagement strategies.\nTo learn more:- here's the brief (.pdf)- here's the patient frameworkRelated Articles:Report: Engage low-income patients to fix income-based care gapStakeholder collaboration can reduce readmission ratesBoost patient engagement with a written physician-patient pledge\nEngagement: Patients involved in their own care do a better job of communicating their own needs, according to the brief."}
