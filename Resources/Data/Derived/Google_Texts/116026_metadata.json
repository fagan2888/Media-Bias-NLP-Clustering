They\u2019ve dramatically raised our taxes, and are so out-of-control in their spending, that private sector job creation and our economic recovery are suffering.\u201d William said.\n\n\u201cDespite the will of the voters and a constitutional prohibition, they ushered in homosexual marriage through so-called civil unions and through repeated attempts of judicial overreach in our court system. They\u2019re so out-of-touch that they even refuse to give justice to mothers who have lost their unborn babies to heinous acts\n\nof murder at the hands of criminals who have no regard for life.\u201d\n\nWilliams noted that Republicans in 2014 were able to take back the state Senate and defeat Democratic U.S. Sen. Mark Udall.\n\n\u201cIf we are to ultimately succeed, then we will need to elect authentic, credible conservatives who can properly articulate our message of limited government and freedom. We need leaders who can work with others to help achieve our conservative Republican goals at the state Capitol.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Bill Cadman,Dave Williams,Gordon Klingenschmitt,House District 15,Josh Hosler", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "The Spot", "description": "Rep.
