And I do think you have to control your borders.\u201d\n\nNow, it appears she regrets those remarks. In an interview with Univision\u2019s Jorge Ramos Monday night, the journalist who was infamously berated by Donald Trump in August, he asked Clinton about her seemingly insensitive comments and wondered if she plans to utter them again.\n\n\u201cWould you commit right now not to use the word \u2018illegal\u2019 or \u2018illegals\u2019 to refer to undocumented immigrants?\u201d Ramos demanded.\n\n\u201cOh yeah,\u201d Clinton quickly answered. \u201cAbsolutely. That was a poor choice of words\u2026I haven\u2019t used it since, I won\u2019t use it in the future.\u201d\n\nClinton then went into more detail about her immigration plans. She agreed that border security was important, yet she objects to Donald Trump\u2019s infamous plan to build a wall and deport millions of illegal \u2013 I mean, undocumented \u2013 immigrants. That, she claims, is \u201cfoolish\u201d and \u201coffensive.\u201d\n\nI guess illegally streaming into our law-abiding country isn't?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hillary backtracks on 'illegal immigrant' comments..05/26/2016 12:11:10PM EST.", "author": "Cortney O'Brien", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Hillary backtracks on 'illegal immigrant' comments.", "title": "Hillary Promises Jorge Ramos She'll Never Again Use The Term 'Illegal Immigrant'", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2016/01/12/hillary-my-use-of-the-term-illegal-immigrant-was-a-poor-choice-of-words-n2103369", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2016/1/12/11.png", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Hillary backtracks on 'illegal immigrant' comments.", "title": "Hillary Promises Jorge Ramos She'll Never Again Use The Term 'Illegal Immigrant'", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2016/01/12/hillary-my-use-of-the-term-illegal-immigrant-was-a-poor-choice-of-words-n2103369", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2016/1/12/11.png", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "'Poor Choice of Words': Hillary Promises Jorge Ramos She'll Never Again Use The Term 'Illegal Immigrant' , Cortney O'Brien, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd5d3\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWould you commit right now not to use the word \u2018illegal\u2019 or \u2018illegals\u2019 to refer to undocumented immigrants?\u201d Ramos demanded.\nAt a New Hampshire town hall last November, Hillary Clinton was happy to remind voters about her history of defending our homeland from illegal immigrants.\n\u201cLook, I voted numerous times when I was a senator to spend money to build a barrier to try to prevent illegal immigrants from coming in.\n\u201cOh yeah,\u201d Clinton quickly answered.\nShe agreed that border security was important, yet she objects to Donald Trump\u2019s infamous plan to build a wall and deport millions of illegal \u2013 I mean, undocumented \u2013 immigrants."}
