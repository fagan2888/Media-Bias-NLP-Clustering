This weekend, make way for the top dogs.\n\nNorth Carolina, Virginia, Kansas and Oregon have all flexed their collective top-seeded muscle with dominant victories that not only flaunted their superiority so far, but showed an all-No. 1 Final Four is a legitimate possibility in Texas.\n\nThe most intriguing roadblocks come Saturday in a pair of 1-2 matchups.\n\nOklahoma (28-7) takes on No. 2 Oregon (31-6) in the West Regional.\n\nKU (33-4) plays No. 2 Villanova (32-5) in the South Regional.\n\n\u201cBoth of us are playing our best basketball right now, and both of us have played pretty well during the season,\u201d Villanova coach Jay Wright said. \u201cIt\u2019s one-seed, two-seed and teams that I think feel very good about how they\u2019re playing. So I would say that\u2019s a heavyweight matchup.\u201d\n\nMuch like in the jumbled alphabet soup of boxing organizations, there are quite a few heavyweight contenders left on Sunday.\n\nVirginia (29-7) plays No. 10 Syracuse (22-13) in the Midwest Regional final.\n\nThe top-seeded Tar Heels stomped Indiana on Friday night and move on to play sixth-seeded Notre Dame (24-11) in the Elite Eight.\n\n\u201cThe Irish don\u2019t lose on Good Friday or Easter Sunday,\u201d Notre Dame coach Mike Brey told his team in the locker room after beating Wisconsin. \u201cCan I get an Amen!\u201d\n\nNotre Dame might need a few amens and a handful of Hail Marys on Sunday \u2014 Notre Dame\u2019s 31-point loss to UNC in the ACC tournament on March 11 was the worst ever for the Irish under Brey.\n\nNo wonder the tourney is dubbed March Madness. The NCAA Tournament has only once sent all four No. 1 seeds to the Final Four, in 2008 when Kansas, Memphis, North Carolina, UCLA advanced and the Jayhawks topped the Tigers for the national championship.\n\nFour No. 1 seeds have reached the Elite Eight seven times since seeding began in 1979, according to STATS LLC.\n\n\u2014 1987; Georgetown, Indiana, North Carolina, UNLV.\n\n\u2014 1993; Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, North Carolina.\n\n\u2014 2001; Duke, Illinois, Michigan State, Stanford.\n\n\u2014 2003; Arizona, Kentucky, Oklahoma, Texas.\n\n\u2014 2007; Florida, Kansas, North Carolina, Ohio State.\n\n\u2014 2008; Kansas, Memphis, North Carolina, UCLA.\n\n\u2014 2009; Connecticut, Louisville, North Carolina, Pittsburgh.\n\nWith the Tar Heels, Cavaliers, Jayhawks and Ducks joining the list this season, it\u2019s truly the Elite \u201cEighth\u201d time the 1s are still on the line.\n\nThe Wildcats have won three tournament games by an average of 24 points, including a 23-point win over No. 3 Miami in the Sweet 16. Villanova is shooting nearly 60 percent from the field in the tournament.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re on fire right now,\u201d said Kansas coach Bill Self, who noted his Jayhawks have been just as dominant.\n\nOregon might be the No. 1 seed most susceptible to a loss, though both the Ducks and the Sooners rely on deep, balanced rosters of athletic players surrounding an elite scorer: Oklahoma\u2019s Buddy Hield and Oregon\u2019s Dillon Brooks.\n\nThe Sooners\u2019 core four of Hield, Ryan Spangler, Jordan Woodard and Isaiah Cousins will start its 104th consecutive game together, along with 36 straight starts by Khadeem Lattin. OU is after its first Final Four trip since 2002.\n\n\u201cWe ride and fight all together, so I think ending on a good note would be special for us,\u201d Hield said.\n\nEven before the ball is tipped April 4 in Houston for the national championship, the true No. 1 is already stamped ACC. North Carolina and Notre Dame will determine one of two guaranteed Atlantic Coast Conference spots in the Final Four. The Fighting Irish beat Wisconsin 61-56 on Friday.\n\nIt will be the same case in the Midwest Regional, where the Virginia-Syracuse matchup ensures at least half the Final Four will be from the ACC. The conference will also have a team play for the national title.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s good, but at the end of the day, I\u2019m a Carolina basketball player so as long as we\u2019re advancing and we\u2019re that No. 1 seed that keeps on moving, that\u2019s all I care about,\u201d North Carolina guard Joel Berry III said.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "NCAA Tournament boasts all 4 No. 1 seeds still in title hunt", "title": "NCAA Tournament boasts all 4 No. 1 seeds still in title hunt", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/03/26/ncaa-tournament-boasts-all-4-no-1-seeds-still-in-title-hunt/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-26T09:36:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-26T09:36:24+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "1 seed that keeps on moving, that\u2019s all I care about,\u201d North Carolina guard Joel Berry III said.\n\u2014 2007; Florida, Kansas, North Carolina, Ohio State.\nNorth Carolina and Notre Dame will determine one of two guaranteed Atlantic Coast Conference spots in the Final Four.\nThe top-seeded Tar Heels stomped Indiana on Friday night and move on to play sixth-seeded Notre Dame (24-11) in the Elite Eight.\n1 seeds to the Final Four, in 2008 when Kansas, Memphis, North Carolina, UCLA advanced and the Jayhawks topped the Tigers for the national championship."}
