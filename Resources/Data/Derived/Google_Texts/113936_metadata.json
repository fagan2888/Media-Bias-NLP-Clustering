Larson says the reimbursement rates are too low. (KURT MILLER/STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER)\n\nThis article originally appeared in the Press-Enterprise.\n\nThe Riverside Medical Clinics \u2014 with 140 doctors in five offices \u2014 is one of the largest providers of health services in the county. But it won\u2019t be participating in the new health exchange marketplace called Covered California.\n\nDr. Steven Larson, the CEO, said he was taken aback when he saw what insurance companies were willing to pay. \u201cThe rates were 70 percent of Medicare [reimbursement]. It doesn\u2019t leave room for making a living,\u201d he said.\n\nThe clinics serve 300,000 patients under a variety of plans, including many Medicare patients who are not affected by the new exchanges. But the patients who want their care covered under a health exchange plan will now to have to look elsewhere for a doctor.\n\nLarson wasn\u2019t sure how many of the clinics\u2019 patients would be affected. \u201cIt\u2019s potentially a huge problem,\u201d said Larson, who also is the chairman of the California Medical Association Board of Trustees.\n\nLarson is not alone by any means. Many physicians around the state are grappling with insurers over participation in Covered California health plans. In some cases they are trying to decide whether to join. In other cases they are finding that they have been dropped from plans. And many are just trying to get information about whether they are listed in an exchange plan or not.\n\nThe struggle has serious implications for consumers who are trying to pick a plan in the exchange that will include their current physician. For uncounted thousands statewide, the answer is, it won\u2019t.\n\nTo get coverage beginning Jan. 1 under Covered California, consumers must sign up by Monday. As the deadline approaches and uncertainty about the breadth of provider networks remains, odds increase that patients will show up for treatment next year thinking they have signed up for a plan with their doctor in it, and find out otherwise.\n\nCovered California maintains that the plans offered through the exchanges include 80 percent of the state\u2019s physicians. \u201cWe arrived at the 80 percent by comparing our network to the two largest commercial networks,\u201d said Covered California spokeswoman Anne Gonzales.\n\nBut physicians and medical society chapters around the state aren\u2019t buying it.\n\n\u201cThe plans have no reason to be transparent about networks \u2014 the bigger it looks, the better for them,\u201d said California Medical Association President Dr. Richard Thorp. \u201cMany times when we look at their physician directories, they include names of people who have moved out of state, are retired or dead.\u201d\n\nSome physicians have been listed in the exchange after they refused to participate because of the low reimbursement rates.\n\nDOCTOR OUT \u2014 OR IN?\n\nDr. Jennifer Hone, an endocrinologist in Santa Barbara, wanted to see for herself if she was listed among the providers in Covered California, even though the clinic where she works, American Indian Health Services, had opted out of the exchange plans over the reimbursement issue.\n\nWhile on the phone with a reporter, she searched Covered California and found, to her dismay, that her name was erroneously listed as part of the Blue Cross network, and at the wrong address.\n\n\u201cI think people who signed up in Santa Barbara are frankly getting screwed,\u201d Hone said. \u201cPeople are being told by insurance companies that they can get coverage and that doctors are participating when in fact that\u2019s a big fat lie.\u201d\n\nCovered California takes pains to note that the insurers, not the state exchange, are responsible for assembling lists of physicians. Doctors \u201ccontract with plans and the plans submit networks to us,\u201d said Covered California\u2019s Gonzales.\n\nA cursory search of doctors listed in current insurance networks compared to exchange plan networks shows dramatic reductions.\n\nIn Riverside County\u2019s 92503 zip code, for example, Anthem Blue Cross currently has 1,460 family and internal medicine doctors in its individual prudent buyer plan. Under its silver plan PPO in the state exchange, it lists 644 providers for the same zip code.\n\nBlue Shield\u2019s database showed a similarly shrunken network of doctors for the 92503 zip code: 1,429 versus 463 for the comparable Covered California plan.\n\nIn Modesto and Santa Barbara zip codes, the differences under Blue Cross were 577 vs. 367 and 257 vs. 87.\n\nAnthem Blue Cross spokesman Darryl Ng insisted that it is not possible to make meaningful \u201capples to apples\u201d comparisons of the health plans. However, Blue Shield spokesperson Lindy Wagner acknowledged that networks are getting narrower, citing one Covered California plan for individuals and families that will have only 60 percent of the physicians listed in a comparable existing plan.\n\nHone says she supports the Affordable Care Act\u2019s commitment to expand health care access to those who could not afford it, which includes the vast majority of the 500 patients the clinic sees monthly. But the clinic decided to stay out of the Covered California exchange market because of reimbursement rates running at only 70 percent of Medicare.\n\nIt would be like getting $65 per patient \u201cwhen it costs $100 to keep the doors open,\u201d she said.\n\nCalifornia Medical Association President Thorp said one of the health carriers also approached him with 10, 20 and 30 percent reimbursement cuts for three different plans. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018Thanks but no thanks.\u2019\u201d\n\nThorp, who practices in rural Paradise, was later informed he\u2019d be included at his current rate because the insurance company didn\u2019t have enough doctors in the area.\n\nCovered California\u2019s Gonzales said that insurers are required to increase the number of doctors in their networks if it turns out that there are too few to provide care for enrolled Californians.\n\nBlue Shield\u2019s Wagner said that to make Covered California plans affordable, insurers contract with providers at discounted rates in exchange for an expanded volume of patients.\n\n\u201cRADIO SILENCE\u201d\n\nSome doctors who said they would not participate in the exchange if rates were deeply cut are unsure whether they\u2019ve been included in the exchange anyway.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been radio silence,\u201d said Dr. William Lewis, an ear, nose and throat \u2014 ENT \u2014 specialist in Los Gatos. Lewis says about a year ago health insurers asked if he and other ENTs would take what he calls draconian cuts. Since then, he polled other ENTS in his part of Santa Clara County, and nobody has heard a thing.\n\nSome doctors may have been included in Covered California exchange plans but haven\u2019t been notified. Insurers are required to notify doctors if they\u2019re included, according to Lisa Folberg, vice president of medical and regulatory policy for the California Medical Association.\n\nThat hasn\u2019t always happened in Riverside, according to Dolores Green, executive director of the Riverside Medical Society. \u201cBasically doctors don\u2019t know if they\u2019re in or out of the network,\u201d she said. The society has told doctors to call the plans directly.\n\nLarson said he will watch how the Covered California plans work, and in the future might talk to insurers about having the Riverside Medical Clinics participate. But he is not optimistic.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m distressed that insurance companies don\u2019t seem to care about quality, only cost,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb9af\"", "article_summary": "A cursory search of doctors listed in current insurance networks compared to exchange plan networks shows dramatic reductions.\nSome doctors may have been included in Covered California exchange plans but haven\u2019t been notified.\nBlue Shield\u2019s database showed a similarly shrunken network of doctors for the 92503 zip code: 1,429 versus 463 for the comparable Covered California plan.\n\u201cIt\u2019s potentially a huge problem,\u201d said Larson, who also is the chairman of the California Medical Association Board of Trustees.\nAnd many are just trying to get information about whether they are listed in an exchange plan or not."}
