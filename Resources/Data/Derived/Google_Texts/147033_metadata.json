The speaker told reporters he expects to have a complete agenda \u201cby the time we have a nominee.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmericans are very anxious right now and rightfully so. How do we go about making sure that we are secure at home? How do we go about building the 21st-century military and make sure we are equipped to defeat ISIS\u2013 the threat posed by Islamic terrorism?\u201d Ryan told reporters Friday at the close of the Republican retreat.\n\nRyan went on to describe stagnant wages and struggling American families, asking, \u201cHow do we fix our tax code? How do we rein in the regulatory state? How do we maximize our Energy potential?\u201d\n\nThe Speaker criticized the president\u2019s Affordable Care Act, saying it led to fewer choices, higher deductibles and less access to the consumer. \u201cHow do we not only repeal this law but what\u2019s solutions lead us to lower costs and they truly patient centered system?\u201d he asked.\n\nThe anti-poverty and opportunity agenda is an initiative, often dealt with by Democrats, but Ryan is quick to explain the differences between how Republicans plan to legislate fro how Democrats legislated it in the past.\n\nRyan told The Daily Caller, \u201cThe status quo, which is now the Obama administration, believe measuring success with the war on poverty is spending more money and having more federal programs and having Washington dictate solutions to communities,\u201d Ryan said.\n\n\u201cWe fundamentally reject that premise. We disagree with that. And so we believe the better more effective way of fighting poverty and combating the lack of upward mobility is to go at the root causes to break the cycle of poverty,\u201d he said. \u201cThat means take our principles and apply them to this problem. What are our principles? We believe in freedom liberty self-determination government by consent government closest to the people. We believe in communities. We believe in federalism.\u201d\n\nFinally, Ryan described the \u201crestoring the Constitution\u201d piece of the Republican Party agenda for the year, calling it \u201ccritical\u201d to the other four pieces.\n\n\u201cHow do you restore the constitution because he presidents executive orders has undermined the constitution and damaged the peoples trust,\u201d he said, later saying, \u201cLook this is nothing short of a generational defining moment we are in. The country is crying out for solutions.\u201d\n\nFollow Kerry on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Kerry Picket", "description": "BALTIMORE\u2014Republicans presented a five point legislative plan Friday for the upcoming election year that hits national security, economic growth, health care,", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "BALTIMORE\u2014Republicans presented a five point legislative plan Friday for the upcoming election year that hits national security, economic growth, health care, an anti-poverty initiative, and restori", "title": "Republicans Present Five Point Legislative Plan For Election Year", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2016/01/17/republicans-present-five-point-legislative-plan-for-election-year/", "image": {"width": 417, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/GettyImages-495488884-e1462484485916.jpg", "height": 504}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "'This is nothing short of a generational defining moment'", "creator": "@KerryPicket", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2016/01/17/republicans-present-five-point-legislative-plan-for-election-year/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/GettyImages-495488884-e1462484485916.jpg"}, "title": "Republicans Present Five Point Legislative Plan For Election Year Via @dailycaller", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2016-01-17 14:19:28", "sailthru.title": "Republicans Present Five Point Legislative Plan For Election Year", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "keywords": "congress,house republicans,paul ryan", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "sailthru.tags": "congress,paul-ryan,kerry-picket", "sailthru.description": "BALTIMORE\u2014Republicans presented a five point legislative plan Friday for the upcoming election year that hits national security, economic growth, health care, an anti-poverty initiative, and restori", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/GettyImages-495488884-e1462484485916.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "The speaker told reporters he expects to have a complete agenda \u201cby the time we have a nominee.\u201d\u201cAmericans are very anxious right now and rightfully so.\nRyan went on to describe stagnant wages and struggling American families, asking, \u201cHow do we fix our tax code?\nWe believe in federalism.\u201dFinally, Ryan described the \u201crestoring the Constitution\u201d piece of the Republican Party agenda for the year, calling it \u201ccritical\u201d to the other four pieces.\nHow do we go about building the 21st-century military and make sure we are equipped to defeat ISIS\u2013 the threat posed by Islamic terrorism?\u201d Ryan told reporters Friday at the close of the Republican retreat.\nHow do we go about making sure that we are secure at home?"}
