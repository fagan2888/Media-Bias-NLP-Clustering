Rooney, a Democrat and former seven-term member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives and former chair of the Democratic State Committee of Pennsylvania \u2022 Alan Novak, the longest serving chairman of the Pennsylvania Republican Party, an Ursinus alum and the chairman of the college\u2019s board of trustees. \u2022 The moderator was Nell McCormack Abom, who in addition to a long career in communications directed media relations for two governors, one a Republican and one a Democrat.\n\nCOLLEGEVILLE \u2014 No American needs a degree in political science to know that politics in this country polarized at nearly every level.\n\nBut perhaps the more important question is \u2014 why?; and, more important than that, what do we do about it?\n\nAnd here\u2019s where a local college can be helpful (no degree required).\n\nBecause that\u2019s where those were the questions put to four professional politicians brave enough to take the stage at a Wednesday forum at Ursinus College titled \u201cPolarization in Politics: How can we build consensus and civility?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere may be hope for American democracy after all, as there was plenty of civility to be found on stage Wednesday night and a fair amount of consensus as well \u2014 including about how you reach a consensus in politics.\n\nChester County Commissioners Chairman Ryan Costello and Montgomery County commissioners\u2019 Chairman Josh Shapiro both said too many politicians conflate consensus with \u201ccentrism,\u201d the idea that the only way to reach consensus is to have no positions too far to the left or the right, which Costello described as \u201clet\u2019s just meet in the middle and call it a day. They key to consensus is not centrism, but the tone with which you govern.\u201d\n\n\u201cA lot of people think you need to be a moderate to reach consensus, but its possible to be a hard-core conservative or an ultra liberal and get something done,\u201d Shapiro said.\n\nHe pointed with pride to the fact that Montgomery County was the first in Pennsylvania to recognize same-sex marriage, but he suspected there was a member of his board who did not agree with that position, so he supported that effort outside of the framework within which they had to work together.\n\n\u201cBut I did not hold press conferences in the meeting room, I did not spend county money on promoting that cause that would force him to vote on it,\u201d said Shapiro. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of having respect for the people you work with.\u201d\n\nIn many ways, T.J. Rooney \u2014 a former member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives \u2014 and Alan Novak \u2014 the longest serving chairman of the Republican Party \u2014 said consensus and civility are each key to the survival of the other \u2014 civility helps reach consensus and reaching consensus repeatedly encourages civility.\n\n\u201cHey, elbows are sharp and campaigns are tough, but what\u2019s changed is what happens after the election is over,\u201d Rooney said.\n\nHe evoked the memory of former House Speaker Tip O\u2019Neill and President Ronald Reagan: \u201cThey would fight like crazy, but at the end of the day, they went into a room, had a drink and worked out a deal.\u201d\n\nNovak said that increased partisanship decreases effectiveness. \u201cYou can pass things on a party-line vote, but it gets harder and harder,\u201d he said, adding \u201cfrankly, I think that\u2019s why the Affordable Care Act has been given such a rough ride because about half the country opposed it.\u201d\n\nBut the public\u2019s opinion is not always enough.\n\nShapiro recalled that during his time in Harrisburg, he was working to get a bill passed that would ban texting-while-driving, \u201cwhich about 92 percent of all Pennsylvanians agreed with.\u201d\n\nBut a Republican erected a procedural obstacle \u201cnot because he didn\u2019t agree with the bill, but because of political reasons and it took another Republican, (state Rep.) Mike Vereb to stand up against his party\u2019s wishes and speak out against that,\u201d Shapiro recalled.\n\nVereb, himself now chairman of the Montgomery County Republican Committee, was in the audience and once again stood up, this time to ask the panelists to address the issue of money in politics.\n\nShapiro said he supported campaign finance reform in the past and even sponsored several bills, but now thinks that the reform measures have back-fired and taken the choice and responsibility for what gets said away from the politicians themselves.\n\nRooney and Novak agreed, saying that the Political Action Committees came from political reforms of the 1970s.\n\n\u201cDo you really think if you change the rules, a professional political operative is just going to say \u2018O.K., you got me, I give up\u2019?\u201d asked Novak. \u201cTheir job is to win.\u201d\n\nBetter, said Rooney, Novak and Shapiro, to have the politician be the ones who accept contributions, but use today\u2019s technology to make it immediately transparent \u201cand let people know right away who you\u2019re taking money from. There might be a union that wants to contribute to a Democrat, but doing so would create some problems. Right now, there are one hundred ways to help without connecting the union\u2019s name to the contribution,\u201d Novak said.\n\nBetter to no longer allow anonymous donations, they said, and make the whole thing transparent.\n\n\u201cSunshine is the best disinfectant,\u201d said Rooney.\n\nSteve Cickay, a Democrat running for the 10th district State Senate seat, asked the panelists their positions on term-limits and, after some sharp questioning from Abom, said he would pledge to serve only one term.\n\nBut Rooney and Novak both said that the more experienced legislators are the ones with the best potential to get things done and to be able to over-rule the staff in Harrisburg who, Rooney said, \u201care the ones who really run the show.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I first got elected, I was a real bed-wetter and I worried about getting reelected even though I was in a pretty safe district and it wasn\u2019t until I had been there for a while that I didn\u2019t care if I lost, I just wanted to do the right thing,\u201d Rooney said.\n\nThe phenomena of a \u201csafe district\u201d was also explored.\n\nPoliticians who are not worried about getting reelected feel less compunction to do things that might not appeal to a homogenous home district, said Novak.\n\nCostello called the gerrymandering of new election districts \u201ca cancer on Democracy.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I get more Democrats in my district, then someone else is getting my Republicans and if someone else gets my Republicans, I don\u2019t have to worry so much about acting on things that might please Republican voters,\u201d said Rooney.\n\nPolitics is also becoming more partisan, the panelists said, because the country is becoming more partisan.\n\n\u201cPolarization comes from the intersection of culture, politics, government, social media and the 24-7 news cycle,\u201d Costello said.\n\n\u201cPolitics is always catching up to culture and right now people are on data overload,\u201d said Novak. \u201cThere are so many places to get information that it\u2019s exhausting to get the information you need for an informed perspective, so human beings fall back on what\u2019s familiar.\u201d\n\nForum moderator Neil McCormack Abom noted that some studies have shown that social media encourages people living in \u201csilos,\u201d where they only interact with people who share the same beliefs.\u201d\n\nThat makes it even more incumbent upon the political parties to broaden their base, said Novak.\n\n\u201cThe parties have to become more diverse, I think the demographics of this country are screaming that pretty loud and clear,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe party that is going to become dominant,\u201d said Costello, \u201cis the one that can appeal to independents because right now, the fastest growing party is the party of \u2018I don\u2019t like either of them,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nOne way to do that might be to allow independents to vote in primaries like in some other states, said Novak, who noted Pennsylvania\u2019s closed primary system \u201cdisenfranchises 20 percent of the voters\u201d and encourages candidates who appeal to each party\u2019s extremes.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to run being the \u2018I build consensus\u2019 candidate, then you better be in a safe district because otherwise you will face a primary challenge from the left or the right,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Shapiro disagreed and said primaries are for \u201ca party to pick their candidate\u201d and said it would be better to attract more independent-minded people into one of the two parties.\n\n\u201cThe truth lies somewhere in the middle of all of us,\u201d said Rooney. \u201cUnless we hear from the middle, we just hear from the extremes.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Politics, Politics news, Norristown Politics news, PA Politics news, US Politics news, world Politics news.", "title": "Political polarization
