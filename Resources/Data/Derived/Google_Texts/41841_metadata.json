Backed by its $3.5 billion endowment as well as its considerable fundraising prowess, the school has built campuses in Abu Dhabi and Shanghai financed by foreign governments, is investing billions in SoHo real estate, and given its star faculty loans to buy summer homes.\n\nBut the university does less than many other schools when it comes to one thing: helping its poor students.\n\nA ProPublica analysis based on new data from the U.S. Department of Education shows that students from low-income families graduate from NYU saddled with huge federal loans. The school\u2019s Pell Grant recipients \u2013 students from families that make less than $30,000 a year \u2013 owe an average of $23,250 in federal loans after graduation.\n\nThat\u2019s more federal loan debt than low-income students take on at for-profit giant University of Phoenix, though NYU graduates have higher earnings and default less on their debt.\n\nNYU is not the only university with a billion-dollar endowment to leave its poorest students with heavy debt loads. More than a quarter of the nation\u2019s 60 wealthiest universities leave their low-income students owing an average of more than $20,000 in federal loans.\n\nAt the University of Southern California, which has a $4.6 billion endowment, low-income students graduate with slightly more debt than NYU\u2019s graduates: $23,375. At Boston University ($1.5 billion endowment), it\u2019s $27,000, and at Wake Forest University ($1.1 billion endowment) low-income students graduate with $29,150 in debt.\n\nThis new data on student debt is drawn from numbers that the Obama administration assembled as part of a planned effort to create grades for every college. In the face of fierce lobbying from universities, the administration backed away, but has made much of the data public on a new website called College Scorecard. ProPublica has used that material to create Debt By Degrees, an interactive database that allows you to search information for almost 7,000 schools. The data provides an unprecedented level of detail on the financial burden that the poorest college students face, showing for the first time how much federal debt poor students take on compared to their wealthier peers, and how well these students are able to repay their loans. The database also shows how much graduates earn on average after leaving school.\n\nThe implications of these numbers can be far-reaching. Studies have shown that even small debts can increase a student\u2019s chances of dropping out, particularly for minorities and low-income students. Also, federal loans, which are typically capped at $27,000 over four years, often don\u2019t cover the full expense of college. Many students also take on private bank loans or work jobs outside school.\n\n\u201cStudent debt is not the same to every borrower,\u201d said Mark Huelsman, a senior analyst at Demos, a public policy nonprofit. \u201cIt can look a lot different to a first generation student from a very modest economic background than to someone going to graduate school getting a law degree.\u201d\n\nIndeed, undergraduates take a fraction of the loans of graduate students but default at much higher rates. Debt can put low-income young adults at a disadvantage for years to come, limiting a graduate\u2019s ability to save, get a mortgage, or get the job they aspire to.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, you\u2019re talking about households that don\u2019t have nearly as much wealth to fall back on,\u201d said Huelsman.\n\nRebecca Arthur wanted nothing more than to study photography at Tisch, NYU\u2019s arts school. Her mother, however, made less than $25,000 a year working at a nursing home, so Arthur knew the school\u2019s four-year price tag of over $250,000 would be a stretch. When Arthur was accepted, she was shocked \u2013 not only because she had gotten into her dream school, but also because the school only offered modest financial aid.\n\n\u201cThe first bill was $32,000 and it was more than my mom made in a year,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy would they accept me if they knew I couldn\u2019t afford it?\u201d\n\nArthur tried to crowdfund the remaining amount of her tuition, but it was only when her mother died a month before school started that NYU agreed to take a second look at her financial aid package. Although they increased her aid, she works four jobs and expects to graduate with over $24,000 in loans.\n\n\u201cThe one downside to NYU is that money is always a big problem,\u201d said Arthur, who is now a sophomore at the university. \u201cPeople that really want [to go to NYU] and deserve it shouldn\u2019t have to fight for it.\u201d\n\nNYU students from poor families graduate with big loans \u2014 more than low-income students at the University of Phoenix. (Robert Mecea/AP)\n\nIn response to recent criticism of its financial priorities, NYU says it has more than doubled financial aid from 2002-2012 and that average student debt has decreased significantly in the past five years. The school also enrolls a greater percentage of Pell Grant recipients than other elite schools. Finally, NYU points out that its endowment is actually quite modest on a per-student basis, since NYU has far more students than many other elite universities.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Despite ten-figure endowments, schools like NYU aren't providing enough aid to keep low-income students afloat", "title": "The nation\u2019s wealthiest colleges are saddling its poorest students with debt", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Despite ten-figure endowments, schools like NYU aren't providing enough aid to keep low-income students afloat", "title": "The nation\u2019s wealthiest colleges are saddling its poorest students with debt", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/09/20/the_nations_wealthiest_colleges_are_saddling_its_poorest_students_with_debt_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/university_storm.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Despite ten-figure endowments, schools like NYU aren't providing enough aid to keep low-income students afloat", "title": "The nation\u2019s wealthiest colleges are saddling its poorest students with debt", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/university_storm.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Annie Waldman and Sisi Wei", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, College, Higher education, NYU, ProPublica, Universities", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc935\"", "article_summary": "Studies have shown that even small debts can increase a student\u2019s chances of dropping out, particularly for minorities and low-income students.\nMore than a quarter of the nation\u2019s 60 wealthiest universities leave their low-income students owing an average of more than $20,000 in federal loans.\nAt Boston University ($1.5 billion endowment), it\u2019s $27,000, and at Wake Forest University ($1.1 billion endowment) low-income students graduate with $29,150 in debt.\nAt the University of Southern California, which has a $4.6 billion endowment, low-income students graduate with slightly more debt than NYU\u2019s graduates: $23,375.\nThat\u2019s more federal loan debt than low-income students take on at for-profit giant University of Phoenix, though NYU graduates have higher earnings and default less on their debt."}
