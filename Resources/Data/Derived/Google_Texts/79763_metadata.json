The revenue-raisers helped cover the cost of the law\u2019s insurance coverage expansion in the 2010 overhaul.\n\nPowerful special interests created a blueprint for further efforts to alter the law by rallying bipartisan opposition to the taxes. The levies were portrayed as economically ruinous, but their elimination wasn\u2019t seen as undermining the central pillars of the coverage expansion. Language suspending the taxes was then folded into a must-pass bill to keep the government running without an insistence on offsets.\n\nThe White House explained its willingness to go along in budgetary terms, saying suspension of the taxes would not affect efforts to reduce the uninsured population and that the law would continue to shrink the deficit. Delaying the three taxes was projected to cost $32 billion over a decade.\n\n\u201cThere is no impact that the two-year suspension of the \u2018Cadillac tax\u2019 will have whatsoever on the continued strength and functioning of the marketplaces moving forward,\u201d White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said. \u201cTheir funding streams are entirely separate.\u201d\n\nStill, Obama\u2019s willingness to temporarily shut off the taxes \u2014 at least two of which the White House has openly opposed repealing \u2014 coupled with the recent enactment of other smaller changes to the law will encourage more proposed revisions.\n\nRobert J. Blendon, a professor of health policy and political analysis at Harvard University, said even a Democratic successor to Obama will tolerate more changes, which could include further delays of the three taxes. Any immediate action is unlikely without a must-pass bill on the horizon that\u2019s on par with the omnibus, he said.\n\nObama\u2019s acquiescence \u201csends a signal that the tax and regulatory pieces of the bill are open for revision after the election,\u201d Blendon said.\n\nThere\u2019s already widespread skepticism over whether the device and insurance taxes will be reinstated, or if the yet-to-be-imposed Cadillac tax will ever take effect. The omnibus paused the medical device tax in 2016 and 2017 and the tax on insurers in 2017. The Cadillac tax, due to take effect in 2018, will be suspended until 2020.\n\nCurtis S. Dubay, a research fellow in tax and economic policy at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said he would wager that the next president and Congress will suspend the device and insurance taxes again so that their next renewals would take place at the same time as the Cadillac tax, before 2020. All three could then continue to be put off on a short-term basis together.\n\nPiece by Piece\n\nBoth Dubay and Joseph Antos, a health care and retirement policy scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, compared the scenario to the series of temporary patches Congress used to repeatedly block Medicare payment cuts to physicians until a permanent fix was enacted last year.\n\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s expecting that the pauses will be permanent. ... We\u2019ll be back in the SGR world again,\u201d Antos said, referring to the old sustainable growth rate formula that dictated the cuts.\n\nPennsylvania Republican Joe Pitts, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Health Subcommittee, also indicated he isn\u2019t expecting the taxes to take effect and said lawmakers are taking a incremental strategy because of the cost of a full repeal of the taxes. \u201cIt\u2019ll be piecemeal,\u201d he told CQ Roll Call.\n\nRepublicans Charles Boustany Jr. of Louisiana and Erik Paulsen of Minnesota, the sponsors of House bills to completely scrap the health insurance and device taxes respectively, both expressed optimism that the levies would be permanently repealed.\n\nBoustany called the health insurance tax suspension \u201ca big victory in that it finally is an affirmative statement that this tax is a problem, it\u2019s causing increases in health insurance premiums for everybody, and it\u2019s something that should be dealt with and eliminated.\u201d\n\nMany Democrats, meanwhile, are eager to prevent the Cadillac tax from taking hold because of its potential effect on union and public employee health plans. Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton notably released a statement in September supporting repeal of the tax, though she said the cost should be offset.\n\nOther Revenue\n\nA Republican budget reconciliation package that Obama vetoed Friday offers a roadmap to what other components in the health care law could be targeted.\n\nBeyond the device, health insurance and Cadillac taxes, the package would scrap penalties on individuals and employers who refuse to comply with the health care law\u2019s coverage mandates, as well as repealing in 2018 the law\u2019s subsidies to help individuals buy health coverage through its insurance marketplaces and its expansion of Medicaid.\n\nThe reconciliation bill would also target an annual fee on brand name prescription drug manufacturers the Congressional Budget Office estimates would cost nearly $30 billion over a decade to repeal. A spokesman for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America declined to comment on whether the big industry trade group would push for relief, but health policy experts are skeptical given the growing public attention over rising drug prices.\n\n\u201cPhRMA is definitely trying to keep its head down,\u201d Antos said.\n\nAnother potential target is the law\u2019s levy on indoor tanning services, which CBO projects would cost a relatively modest $800 million over a decade to repeal.\n\nGetting rid of the overhaul\u2019s additional Medicare tax on high earners, meanwhile, has a much larger price tag of $123 billion over 10 years. Eliminating the health care law\u2019s tax on net investment income of individuals, estates and trusts with earnings above certain thresholds would also prompt a significant drop in revenues, with an estimated cost of nearly $223 billion over a decade.\n\n\u201cIf you look at where the money is in the bill, those taxes are probably not going to be politically popular to get rid of,\u201d said Washington and Lee University law professor Timothy S. Jost, who supports the overhaul.\n\nBut efforts to repeal other revenue-raisers already have generated some bipartisan interest.\n\nThe House Ways and Means Committee advanced legislation with a handful of Democratic co-sponsors last year to scrap the law\u2019s restriction on using health savings accounts to pay for over-the-counter drugs. Lawmakers also introduced a bill with some Democratic support to remove a requirement that insurers pay into a program that provides money to health plans that enroll high-cost individuals, though that program will phase out after 2016.\n\nIn addition, the House passed legislation in June to scrap a Medicare cost-cutting board prescribed in the law that has yet to be implemented. Eleven Democrats joined Republicans in support of the measure \u2014 a count that would have been higher if the cost had not been offset by tapping the law\u2019s funding for prevention and public health programs.\n\nNeil Trautwein, vice president for health care policy at the National Retail Federation, said his group worked particularly hard on winning relief from the Cadillac tax and that he hopes the health law changes in the funding package are the \u201cnew normal.\u201d Still, he predicted that attempts to stop more of the law\u2019s taxes would receive strong pushback for the remainder of the Obama administration, especially outside of the government funding context.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see any white flags over the White House,\u201d Trautwein said.\n\n\u2014 Contact Attias at Mattias@cq.com and follow her on Twitter at @MelissaAttias.", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Barack Obama\u2019s willingness to sign a year-end spending package that suspended more than $30 billion worth of taxes mandated by the 2010 health care law will energize opponents\u2019 efforts to further alter his signature legislative achievement, though the most significant changes may have to wait until after the elections.", "og": {"site_name": "Roll Call", "description": "President Barack Obama\u2019s willingness to sign a year-end spending package that suspended more than $30 billion worth of taxes mandated by the 2010 health care law will energize opponents\u2019 efforts to further alter his signature legislative achievement, though the most significant changes may have to wait until after the elections.", "title": "Suspending Obamacare Taxes May Fuel More Calls for Change", "url": "http://www.rollcall.com/news/-245350-1.html", "image": {"type": "image/png"}, "updated_time": "2016-01-08T12:50:42Z", "type": "website"}, "abstract": "President Barack Obama\u2019s willingness to sign a year-end spending package that suspended more than $30 billion worth of taxes mandated by the 2010 health care law will energize opponents\u2019 efforts to further alter his signature legislative achievement, though the most significant changes may have to wait until after the elections.", "fb": {"app_id": 1383531991672364}, "keywords": "iProCategory,iProStoryType,iProProductCategory,iProSpecialCategory,iProSpecialCategory,iProSpecialCategory,iProSDMID", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-08T12:50:42Z", "modified_time": "2016-01-08T12:50:42Z"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.rollcall.com/news/-245350-1.html", "site": "@rollcall", "description": "President Barack Obama\u2019s willingness to sign a year-end spending package that suspended more than $30 billion worth of taxes mandated by the 2010 health care law will energize opponents\u2019 efforts to f", "card": "summary |player (See: https://dev.twitter.com/cards/types/player We will have to submit a test and get approval before using this type)", "title": "Suspending Obamacare Taxes May Fuel More Calls for Change"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "There\u2019s already widespread skepticism over whether the device and insurance taxes will be reinstated, or if the yet-to-be-imposed Cadillac tax will ever take effect.\nOther RevenueA Republican budget reconciliation package that Obama vetoed Friday offers a roadmap to what other components in the health care law could be targeted.\nThe Cadillac tax, due to take effect in 2018, will be suspended until 2020.\nLanguage suspending the taxes was then folded into a must-pass bill to keep the government running without an insistence on offsets.\nThe revenue-raisers helped cover the cost of the law\u2019s insurance coverage expansion in the 2010 overhaul."}
