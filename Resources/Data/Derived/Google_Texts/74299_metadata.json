The new version also offers fixes for a number of security flaws that could let a remote attacker obtain unauthorized access or cause a denial of service.\n\nThe 64-bit Chrome version improves the speed of graphics and video including high definition YouTube videos, Google wrote in a blog post. It\u2019s also twice as stable as 32-bit engines when handling typical web content. The company said the increased capacity makes it possible for its security mitigations to better defend against certain types of attacks. This is part of Google\u2019s \u201cdefense in depth\u201d strategy to deploy a variety of stumbling blocks to the attacker.\n\nChromium, the open source web browser project from which Google Chrome draws its source code, has worked to make the browser more modular. This makes it possible to separate different functions and create an extra layer of defense, known as a sandbox, for each one to improve security. Sandboxes help prevent malicious code from infecting applications through the browser.\n\nThe new version of Chrome, also available for Windows 32-bit, Mac and Linux, offers about 50 fixes to security flaws. Every six weeks, Google updates Chrome to fix security flaws found both by its security team and a group of external security researchers, according to Google spokesperson Veronica Navarrete.\n\nThe most important of the 50 patches is a critical fix for a series of vulnerabilities that could let malicious code escape the browser and attack other applications, Dennis Fisher, security evangelist at Kaspersky Lab, said in an email. Google paid a $30,000 bug bounty to a security researcher known as lokihardt@asrt for finding the series of vulnerabilities.\n\nLike other browsers, Chrome has a sandbox built in to prevent malicious code from infecting applications through the browser. Google\u2019s security team has made it difficult for that to occur, to the point that attackers typically need several vulnerabilities chained together to accomplish the task, said Mr. Fisher. \u201cAttackers place a high value on those sandbox escapes as they could be very useful in targeted attacks,\u201d he said.\n\nMany companies worry that attackers will gain access to their systems by exploiting a flaw in an employee Web browser. Once into corporate systems, attackers have a much easier time moving laterally through a corporate network because there typically aren\u2019t as many defenses behind the firewall.\n\nIn April, a security hole in Microsoft\u2019s Internet Explorer was discovered. Microsoft said it would let hackers have the same level of access on a network computer as the official user, wrote the Journal\u2019s Danny Yadron. At the time, Microsoft said it was aware of \u201climited, targeted attacks\u201d that attempted to exploit the flaw. Security firm FireEye, which discovered the vulnerability, described it as part of a hacking campaign against U.S. financial and defense companies, Mr. Yadron wrote.\n\nWrite to rachael.king@wsj.com", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Google has released a version of Chrome that includes 64-bit support for Windows that it says offers better speed, stability and security.
