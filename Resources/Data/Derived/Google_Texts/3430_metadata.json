Tournament of Champions sans pants. \u201cI was informed backstage a few minutes ago that our three contestants \u2026 wanted to relieve some of the tension, and they said, \u2018We must do the program without trousers,\u2019\u201d he informed the audience. \u201cNow can we get a camera to make sure that they have done the same as I?\u201d As it turned out, the contestants were, in fact, wearing pants. Trebek wasn\u2019t ruffled. Cool as a Canadian snowstorm, he walked offstage to go put his pants back on. Trebek is just that kind of guy. It would be neat to meet him someday. If you\u2019re reading this, Trebek, I really mean that last part. I take the online test as often as they give it. Once, in high school, I made it as far as an audition for the teen contest, after which I never heard from them again. I told everyone who would listen that it was probably because I had \u201ca slow buzzer thumb.\u201d By now, enough time has passed that I\u2019m okay admitting: It was not about the buzzer thumb. Those questions were hard.\n\nYou know what else is hard, though? Making yourself seem interesting to a national audience in 30 seconds or less. (I would imagine. Not bitter!) The Jeopardy! contestant interviews are the layover en route to the beach vacation, the dry cookie barrier to the Double Stuf creme\u2014the thing you do your best to forget on the way to the good part. As awkward as they are to watch, one can only imagine they\u2019re that much worse for the contestants themselves, stammering through fun facts that aren\u2019t actually that fun. And because the world is a merciless place that takes as often as it gives, the winning contestants have to suffer through this undignified ritual up to five times per day, the number of episodes recorded in each session. But because the world is also a generous place that gives as often as it takes, it has blessed us with the Twitter account @CoolJepStories, which, in its own words, \u201csimplistically yet accurately summariz[es] the insipid contestant interview.\u201d It is, to simplistically yet accurately summarize, delightful. 12/23/15: \"My mom said Germany was America\" \"I went to school with my wife\" \"My Latin teacher was great\" #Jeopardy pic.twitter.com/7MPiYeJdtm \u2014 CoolJeopardyStories (@CoolJepStories) December 24, 2015 12/22/15: \"I read Lord of the Rings annually.\" \"I dressed as broccoli.\" \"Matthew Broderick mocked me.\" #Jeopardy pic.twitter.com/FBewzFxiRz \u2014 CoolJeopardyStories (@CoolJepStories) December 23, 2015 1/11/16: \"My great-grandpa was a tattooed circus man\" \"My dog watches animals on TV\" \"I love barbecuing\" #Jeopardy pic.twitter.com/iaRnpXYzBA \u2014 CoolJeopardyStories (@CoolJepStories) January 12, 2016 Who doesn\u2019t love barbecuing?

And, if so, does his drippiness mean he is now her past man? Or has her current partner simply improved his once-drippy ways? There\u2019s no way of knowing, really.
