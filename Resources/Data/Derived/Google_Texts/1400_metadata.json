( Brennan Linsley / AP Photo )\n\nA look at Colorado's school tax proposal Amendment 66 on Colorado ballots has been called an \"extreme makeover\" of how the state funds public education. A glance at what the proposal does: \u2014 RAISES income taxes for all. The measure could raise about $950 million in new state revenue in its first year, rising to about $1.01 billion in 2015-16 \u2014 REVIVES a progressive income tax structure. The state income tax rate for income up to $75,000 a year would increase from 4.63 percent to 5 percent. Income above $75,000 would be taxed at 5.9 percent. \u2014 INCREASES state school funding by about $1 billion a year. Average statewide per-pupil spending would rise from the current $6,652 to an estimated $7,426. \u2014 REPEALS the state's current \"cost-of-living\" boost for schools in expensive areas. \u2014 SENDS more money to districts with a high percentage of at-risk students. \u2014 REPEALS Amendment 23, which requires base school funding to increase every year by enrollment and the rate of inflation. \u2014 REPLACES Amendment 23 with a new requirement that 43 percent of state general fund revenues be earmarked for basic school funding. \u2014 PAYS for school reforms already passed into law, including a revised teacher-tenure framework \u2014 COUNTS students throughout the year, instead of on a single day, so head-counts for funding are more accurate. \u2014 The Associated Press Advertisement\n\nDenver \u2014 An income tax question to be decided by Colorado voters Tuesday sets up a watershed change for how public schools are funded and could be the largest voter-approved tax hike in state history.\n\nBut Amendment 66 is so complicated that it's hard to find a voter who understands it.\n\nThe ballot measure rewrites Colorado's labyrinthine School Finance Act to correct funding imbalances that state education officials say have grown worse over time. The proposal would raise income taxes an estimated $950 million a year. It would also revive a progressive income tax structure Colorado abandoned in the 1980s.\n\nFor state-taxable income of $75,000 or less, the income tax rate would increase from 4.63 percent to 5 percent. Income above $75,000 would be taxed at 5.9 percent.\n\nSupporters of the measure have raised more than $10 million to promote it. They've aired television ads promoting more arts education and other easy-to-understand upgrades that could result if voters pass the measure. Supporters have campaign offices spread across the state and are touting the amendment as an important investment in the state's future.\n\nStill, the measure's prospects are far from certain.\n\nConfusion and uncertainty seemed to dominate voters' minds on several trips to question voters about the idea. Moms visiting the Denver Botanic Gardens liked the proposal but didn't understand what it would do. Retirees at a coffee shop said they didn't think either side of the tax campaign was giving them the full story. One mother grabbing a sandwich on her lunch break said she voted against the measure \u2014 because she thought it would take money away from schools.\n\nThe mood was summed up nicely by Brent Haldiman, a 32-year-old consultant in Denver who hadn't made up his mind on the school tax measure last week.\n\n\"I want to say yes, but I don't know,\" he said. \"Everyone wants to give more money to schools, right? But what is this really going to do? I couldn't tell you.\"\n\nThe measure would raise per-pupil funding and backfill school budgets that were hurt by falling tax revenue during the recession. It would eliminate the state's \"cost-of-living factor\" funding boost and drive more money to districts with large numbers of at-risk students.\n\nThe proposal would also fully fund half-day preschool for at-risk students and give schools money to implement stricter teacher-tenure standards.\n\nSupporters call the school overhaul a complicated but necessary modernization of how Colorado funds public education. Critics complain that additional money doesn't ensure students get better educations and that the measure doesn't contain adequate safeguards to ensure the money is spent as intended.\n\nThe tax structure itself has also inspired debate. Some business groups have given the measure a chilly reception because it revives the progressive income tax framework Colorado used from the 1930s to the 1980s. Supporters of the measure insist that a progressive tax framework, where the wealthy pay a greater percentage of their incomes, is used in most states and won't damage the economy.\n\nPolling on the tax measure is scant, and voter turnout is projected to be low. It's an electoral off-year and Amendment 66 supporters are prepared for half as many voters as in 2012.\n\nEven guessing turnout is dicey. This is the first statewide election in which all registered voters received ballots at home.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/news/canoncity-local-news/ci_24447561/amendment-66-confusion-reigns-state-school-tax-question", "modificationDate": "2013-11-03T19:45:47-0700", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2013/1103/20131103__04DRTAX~1_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By KRISTEN WYATT \n \n  Associated Press", "description": "A look at Colorado's school tax proposalAmendment 66 on Colorado ballots has been called an \"extreme makeover\" of how the state funds public education.", "ag": {"canon": "CanonCityDailyRecord:article:24447561:view"}, "startDate": "2013-11-03T19:45:01-0700", "og": {"url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/news/canoncity-local-news/ci_24447561/amendment-66-confusion-reigns-state-school-tax-question", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2013/1103/20131103__04DRTAX~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A look at Colorado's school tax proposalAmendment 66 on Colorado ballots has been called an \"extreme makeover\" of how the state funds public education.", "title": "Amendment 66: Confusion reigns on state school tax question"}, "twitter": {"domain": "canoncitydailyrecord.com", "description": "A look at Colorado's school tax proposalAmendment 66 on Colorado ballots has been called an \"extreme makeover\" of how the state funds public education.", "title": "Amendment 66: Confusion reigns on state school tax question", "url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/news/canoncity-local-news/ci_24447561/amendment-66-confusion-reigns-state-school-tax-question", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2013/1103/20131103__04DRTAX~1.jpg", "site": "@CCDR_news", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-11-03T19:45:01-0700", "sailthru.site": "canoncitydailyrecord.com", "endDate": "2023-11-03T19:02:13-0600", "sailthru.title": "Amendment 66: Confusion reigns on state school tax question", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Canon City News", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "oCjqPZ-ii-IZW-fBJ0mmX5dmH5aafePG3FLx_kSYFiA", "byline": "By KRISTEN WYATTAssociated", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2013/1103/20131103__04DRTAX~1.jpg", "pubDate": "2013-11-03T19:47:29-0700", "news_keywords": "Education, Education news, Canyon City Colorado Education news, Canyon City Colorado news, Education Canyon City news, Education Colorado news, US Education news, world Education news."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9449\"", "article_summary": "The state income tax rate for income up to $75,000 a year would increase from 4.63 percent to 5 percent.\n\u2014 INCREASES state school funding by about $1 billion a year.\nFor state-taxable income of $75,000 or less, the income tax rate would increase from 4.63 percent to 5 percent.\nThe mood was summed up nicely by Brent Haldiman, a 32-year-old consultant in Denver who hadn't made up his mind on the school tax measure last week.\n\u2014 REPLACES Amendment 23 with a new requirement that 43 percent of state general fund revenues be earmarked for basic school funding."}
