By contrast, between 34 percent and 53 percent of the uninsured in states not expanding Medicaid will qualify for assistance:\n\nThe study also finds that expanding Medicaid will be particularly beneficial to the most uninsured states. Kentucky, Michigan, and West Virginia are all expected to see 81 percent of their uninsured populations qualify for some sort of assistance \u2014 either through an expanded public health program, or Obamacare\u2019s subsidies.\n\n\u201cIn every state, except for Massachusetts, Medicaid expansion would result in more uninsured people becoming eligible for assistance and a greater reduction in the number of uninsured,\u201d wrote the study authors. \u201cFor example\u2026 without expansion, 36 percent of the uninsured in Mississippi would be eligible for assistance and the ACA would reduce the number of uninsured by 29 percent\u2026 [But] under the Medicaid expansion, 80 percent of Mississippi\u2019s uninsured would be eligible for assistance, and the projected number of uninsured would decrease by 54 percent.\u201d\n\nThe District of Columbia and 25 states are moving forward or attempting to move forward with Medicaid expansion. Another 22 states are currently refusing expansion, while the remaining three have yet to make up their minds.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "In states that aren't expanding Medicaid under Obamacare, the vast majority of the uninsured won't receive any public assistance to help them get covered.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "In states that aren't expanding Medicaid under Obamacare, the vast majority of the uninsured won't receive any public assistance to help them get covered.", "title": "MAP: How GOP Governors Resisting Obamacare Are Denying Coverage To The Poorest Americans", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2013/10/09/2756641/gop-govs-medicaid-obamacare-subsidies/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/expand-medicaid.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In states that aren't expanding Medicaid under Obamacare, the vast majority of the uninsured won't receive any public assistance to help them get covered.", "creator": "@the_sy_guy", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/expand-medicaid-321x214.jpg", "title": "MAP: How GOP Governors Resisting Obamacare Are Denying Coverage To The Poorest Americans", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/expand-medicaid.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/expand-medicaid.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2013-10-09T15:40:11+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda6bf\"", "article_summary": "Another 22 states are currently refusing expansion, while the remaining three have yet to make up their minds.\n\u201cIn every state, except for Massachusetts, Medicaid expansion would result in more uninsured people becoming eligible for assistance and a greater reduction in the number of uninsured,\u201d wrote the study authors.\nBy contrast, between 34 percent and 53 percent of the uninsured in states not expanding Medicaid will qualify for assistance:The study also finds that expanding Medicaid will be particularly beneficial to the most uninsured states.\nAccording to the report, between 59 percent and 81 percent of the uninsured living in states expanding Medicaid under Obamacare would qualify for health coverage assistance programs like Medicaid, the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), or Obamacare subsidies to buy private insurance through the new statewide marketplaces.\nKentucky, Michigan, and West Virginia are all expected to see 81 percent of their uninsured populations qualify for some sort of assistance \u2014 either through an expanded public health program, or Obamacare\u2019s subsidies."}
