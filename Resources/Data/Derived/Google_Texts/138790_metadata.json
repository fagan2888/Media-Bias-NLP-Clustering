I\u2019m sad to say that I discovered the story by living it, and I know others are living it as well.\n\nI left my job in April to start my own business. I knew that I\u2019d need to navigate the individual health-insurance market eventually, but my first priority was the work of building my business. By choosing to enroll in COBRA, I knew my husband and I could maintain the good coverage my employer had provided to me until we took the time to investigate other options. We\u2019re paying $1,500 a month for our plan, which is terribly expensive, but it\u2019s a very fine plan, and I thought we\u2019d only be eating the high cost for a few months.\n\nLast week, I felt I had the time to put my business on hold for a day and find a cheaper health insurance plan. By searching online, including significant time on healthcare.gov, I found a couple of decent options from Blue Cross/Blue Shield \u2014 high-deductible plans in the \u201cbronze\u201d category that would cost us from about $530 to $700 a month.\n\n[MORE: Cartoons on Obamacare]\n\nHappy with my search, analysis and decision, I started clicking away on the Blue Cross website to apply for one of these more affordable plans. I quickly discovered I would need to qualify for a \u201cspecial enrollment period\u201d to purchase a new plan at this time. Otherwise, it appeared, I would need to wait for open-enrollment season in November \u2026 to apply for a plan that begins in January.\n\nSuddenly panicked, I switched over to healthcare.gov to find out if I could qualify for a special enrollment period (you can check out the qualifications here).\n\nIn short, a \u201clife event\u201d needs to have happened to me or my husband to qualify for special enrollment. One of us needs to have lost a job or had coverage canceled. We\u2019d be in luck if we\u2019d gotten divorced or moved or had a baby. But none of this has happened to us.\n\n[SEE: Cartoons on President Obama]\n\nI believe that I had a huge life event; I chose to leave my job and start my own business. But that is not a qualifying event under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nI called Blue Cross twice, and talked to two different sales representatives, to make sure I was reading all of this correctly. Each real person confirmed for me that someone on COBRA coverage is not eligible to purchase \u201can ACA-compliant plan\u201d until open enrollment season.\n\nThen I looked back at the eight, small-print, single-spaced pages I received from my employer with COBRA information back in April. My heart sank. At the bottom of one of the incredibly dense and confusing pages, there is, in fact, a note that reads:\n\nPlease Note: If you enroll in COBRA you are not eligible for special enrollment until the next open enrollment period or until your COBRA maximum period expires. Voluntarily quitting other health coverage such as COBRA or being terminated for not paying your premiums are not considered loss of coverage.\n\n\n\n[READ: The GOP Targets Obamacare's Achilles' Heel]\n\nThat was the moment I accepted that it\u2019s true. I\u2019m stuck. For the first time in my life, I literally cannot choose to buy a different product for reasons of cost. My government will not allow it.\n\nIf I drop my $1,500-a-month COBRA coverage, my husband and I will be uninsured, at risk and in violation of federal law. If we keep it, we\u2019ll end up spending $12,000 on health insurance in my first eight months of self-employment.\n\nThe expense is going to be devastating. It will decimate what I\u2019ve earned as a sole proprietor so far. It makes me feel like I\u2019m trying to fill a hole that someone else is digging. I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s not what the goal of the health care law was, right?\n\n[READ: Obamacare Is (Still) Fiscally Responsible]\n\nWhile most of the blame for this predicament can, I believe, be squarely placed on the terrible health care law that we now live under, I\u2019m willing to take some responsibility for what I should have known. I have real, awful, feelings of regret. After all, I have spent about half of my career learning and writing about health care policy. When I read my COBRA packet, I thought I really understood it.\n\nBut I also find myself thinking, \u201cMy God, if I couldn\u2019t figure this out, how could someone who had zero familiarity with the health care law?\u201d\n\nWhich is why I asked one of the Blue Cross sales agents whether she\u2019d received a lot of calls like mine. She said that, indeed, they have. People on COBRA are calling in the hopes of switching to more affordable plans and they are being turned away.\n\nI\u2019ve known for a long time that the Affordable Care Act all but ignored the pressing cost concerns of the self-employed. I\u2019ve written and talked about it as a professional for years. But I\u2019ve just discovered the hard way that the perspective of an entrepreneur must have been completely, 100 percent missing from both the legislative debate and the regulatory process surrounding this law. The president likes to say that the Affordable Care Act helps entrepreneurs and small-business owners. I can tell you plainly: He is lying.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "title": "How Obamacare Screwed Up My Small Business Health Insurance", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Think the health care law is good for small businesses?
