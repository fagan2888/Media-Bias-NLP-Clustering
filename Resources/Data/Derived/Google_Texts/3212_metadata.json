Naturally, the anti-GMO claque hailed it. The study was severely criticized by researchers representing leading toxicological science organizations. As Nature reported:\n\nLast week, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) in Parma, Italy, and Germany\u2019s Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) in Berlin both issued initial assessments slamming the paper, bluntly asserting that its conclusions are not supported by the data presented. \u201cThe design, reporting and analysis of the study, as outlined in the paper, are inadequate,\u201d says the EFSA in a press release, adding that the paper is \u201cof insufficient scientific quality to be considered as valid for risk assessment\u201d.\n\nIn light of those criticisms, the editor of the journal in which it was published chose to retract it last fall. The retraction most likely affected the sales of Seralini's book and associated documentary, both entitled, Tous Cobayes (All Guinea Pigs). Seralini has managed to find another less rigorous journal in which to republish his flawed study, Environmental Sciences Europe.\n\nThe anti-biotechies are treating the republication as an activist triumph over corporate suppression of science. It is, instead, a very sad commentary on how the producers of flawed science can search around to find some obscure journal or other in which to publish their junk findings. The progressive news/activist website Alternet features an article from The Ecologist that claims:\n\nA highly controversial paper by Prof Gilles-Eric S\u00e9ralini and colleagues has been republished after a stringent peer review process.\n\nSimilarly Mother Earth News reports:\n\nThe republication restores the study to the peer-reviewed literature so that it can be consulted and built upon by other scientists.\n\nStringent peer-review? False. The study was not, in fact, peer-reviewed by Environmental Sciences Europe. So why would folks assert that it was? Largely because of the press materials released by Seralini himself making that claim. Nature reports what actually happened:\n\nEnvironmental Sciences Europe (ESEU) decided to re-publish the paper to give the scientific community guaranteed long-term access to the data in the retracted paper, editor-in-chief Henner Hollert told Nature. \u201cWe were Springer Publishing\u2019s first open access journal on the environment, and are a platform for discussion on science and regulation at a European and regional level.\u201d ESEU conducted no scientific peer review, he adds, \u201cbecause this had already been conducted by Food and Chemical Toxicology, and had concluded there had been no fraud nor misrepresentation.\u201d The role of the three reviewers hired by ESEU was to check that there had been no change in the scientific content of the paper, Hollert adds.\n\nOne of the proprietors of the Retraction Watch website summarized the sorry situation well in response to a CBS News query:\n\n\u201cThis whole episode has taken us farther away from knowing the truth,\u201d Ivan Oransky, a founder and editor of retractionwatch.com, told CBS News. \u201cThe ratio of politics to science when it comes to discussions of GMOs [genetically modified organisms] is so high that I think it often ceases to be useful,\u201d said Oransky, a journalist with a medical degree who is also vice president and global editorial director of MedPage Today. He also said: \u201cThis is a good example of what happens when people with hardened beliefs manipulate a system for the result they want,\u201d Oransky told CBS News. \u201cScience should be about following the evidence, appropriately changing your mind if the evidence warrants it. But in this case people seem to reject the evidence that doesn\u2019t suit their needs.\u201d\n\nWith regard to rejecting evidence that doesn't suit activist needs, see my article, \"A Tale of Two Scientific Consensuses.\"", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "In 2012, anti-biotech activist Gilles-Eric Seralini managed to get his seriously flawed study in which he claimed that feeding rats biotech corn caused", "title": "Retracted Junk Science Study Claiming Biotech Corn Causes Cancer In Rats Republished Without Peer Review", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2014/07/15/retracted-junk-science-study-claiming-bi", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14054326229657.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14054326229657.jpg", "title": "Retracted Junk Science Study Claiming Biotech Corn Causes Cancer In Rats Republished Without Peer Review", "description": "In 2012, anti-biotech activist Gilles-Eric\nSeralini managed to get his \nseriously flawed study in which he claimed that feeding rats\nbiotech corn caused them to develop tumors.
