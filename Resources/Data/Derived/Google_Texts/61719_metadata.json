Nearly two decades later, 35 people work for the risk-management and financial services firm.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re bursting at the seams,\u201d said Rich Preuss, one of the company\u2019s four owners. \u201cIt\u2019s been slow-and-steady growth in all of our divisions. We keep adding clients, and, as we do that, we have to add more support staff.\u201d\n\nSo, Healy Group is expanding.\n\nConstruction started in June on a new building that will more than double the firm\u2019s space to 12,300 square feet. The $2.4 million project is at the northwest corner of Carmichael Drive and Generations Drive, in the same office park where Healy Group is currently located.\n\nHealy\u2019s owners \u2014 Tony Nyers, Randy Raciti, Chris Rowland and Preuss \u2014 expect the new building to be ready by the end of January.\n\nRaciti said diversification has been a key to the company\u2019s growth. The firm has four divisions: Healy Benefits, Healy Financial, Healy Insurance and Healy Mortgage. He said that combination provides a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for clients\u2019 insurance and financial needs.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve found that\u2019s helpful when you go through difficult economic periods like we did with the Great Recession,\u201d Raciti said. \u201cFor instance, our mortgage division boomed during that period of time with all the refinances that were going on.\u201d\n\nHealy Benefits advisers also have been helping businesses and individuals with their health insurance decisions under the Affordable Care Act, the health care overhaul that Congress passed in 2010.\n\n\u201cIn the benefits world, health care reform certainly is giving us lots of opportunities to guide our clients through it,\u201d said Rowland, who is a citizen advisory member of the Tribune\u2019s editorial board. \u201cThere are some opportunities we want to take advantage of as it continues to unfold.\u201d\n\nNyers added, \u201cI think we\u2019re going to see consolidation in the benefits world, so there will be opportunities for acquisitions, and that might be where we\u2019d see additional locations. The way we situated our lot (for the new building), we have room to expand with a second building on our property.\u201d\n\nHealy has invested in technology as well to keep up with clients who previously lived in the Michiana area but have retired to warmer climes. The company has clients in at least 25 states.\n\n\u201cWe see more of that happening in the future,\u201d Raciti said. \u201cFor us, technology has been really important to create Web meetings with our clients to maintain that personal contact, that high touch.\u201d\n\nAnd Healy\u2019s employees have a good incentive to perform well.\n\nThe firm\u2019s founder, Edward Healy, started the company in 1976 and decided in 1984 to open ownership to other partners.\n\n\u201cWhen you have a path to becoming an owner, I think there\u2019s something that gets people more focused on doing the best possible job,\u201d Preuss said. \u201cOur desire is that we have lots of owners. Ed would say that 25 percent of a really big pie is better than 100 percent of a little pie.\u201d\n\nRaciti added, \u201cOur people are the greatest strength of our organization. Ed Healy used to say you can take everything away from me but my people, and we will be up and going strong again in a short period of time.\u201d\n\nKAllen@SBTinfo.com\n\n574-235-6244\n\nTwitter: @KevinAllenSBT", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "South Bend Tribune", "description": "Firm doubling space with new location", "title": "Healy Group outgrows building", "url": "http://www.southbendtribune.com/news/business/healy-group-outgrows-building/article_16049723-9cce-50d4-b419-b60e4f4f30d7.html", "image": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/southbendtribune.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/6/3e/63ec0947-f28b-571f-8fb2-bb019a062f34/540dde4b795e4.image.jpg?resize=760%2C523", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/southbendtribune.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/6/3e/63ec0947-f28b-571f-8fb2-bb019a062f34/540dde4b795e4.image.jpg?resize=760%2C523", "description": "Firm doubling space with new location", "site": "@sbtribune", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Healy Group outgrows building"}, "description": "Firm doubling space with new location", "Published Date": "2014-09-08T12:46:00", "fb": {"app_id": 368553839952510}, "keywords": "#loc,business,featured,top_story", "google-site-verification": "3g1dW83HuQbWT4MB-AtH0czzqvwh0eF8rwGwC6sjOhM", "news_keywords": "#loc,business,featured,top_story"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd37f1\"", "article_summary": "The firm has four divisions: Healy Benefits, Healy Financial, Healy Insurance and Healy Mortgage.\nSOUTH BEND \u2014 Healy Group had 10 employees when it moved into a new building in 1995.\nWe keep adding clients, and, as we do that, we have to add more support staff.\u201dSo, Healy Group is expanding.\nHe said that combination provides a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for clients\u2019 insurance and financial needs.\nThe $2.4 million project is at the northwest corner of Carmichael Drive and Generations Drive, in the same office park where Healy Group is currently located."}
