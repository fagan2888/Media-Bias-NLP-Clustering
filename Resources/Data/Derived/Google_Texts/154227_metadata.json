specifically beer and spirits.\n\nPossible explanations include the fact that liberals are more likely to rebel through drinking, sex, and drugs, to the belief that public healthcare - such as Obamacare - and social systems are more likely to pick up the pieces if their drinking becomes a problem.\n\nEconomists behind the study examined all 50 states from 1952 to 2010 and found that the results agreed with previous research showing that socialists in Russia were more likely to drink than their more conservative counterparts.\n\nResearchers estimate that if the congressional representatives for Michigan - just over half of whom are Democrats - became as liberal as Vermont - where two thirds voted for Barack Obama - the population could be expected to guzzle an extra two gallons of beer per year.\n\nDr Pavel Yakovlev, a professor of economics at Duquesne University, in Pittsburg, added that the numbers were adjusted for economic, demographic and religious differences.\n\nA separate study of consumer habits by Hunch.com found that liberals were 28 per cent more likely to drink both beer and wine compared with conservatives who favoured milk and fizzy drinks.\n\nAnother study published in Psychology Science also showed that when both liberals and conservatives did drink, Democrats were more likely to favour new, cheap brands of beer compared with conservatives who preferred pricier and more established names.\n\nDespite his ale-swilling image, data suggests that right-wing voters in the UK - such as UKIP party leader Nigel Farage - are less likely to drink than their more liberal counterparts\n\nFor UK drinkers the same could be true, as 2013 data from the Lifestyle Statistics, Health and Social Care Information Centre showed that most problem drinking occurred in the North, traditionally a Labour stomping ground.\n\nMen in the North East were the heaviest drinkers, with 68 per cent regularly exceeding their daily limit, while those in London - where the Tories attract more votes - were less likely to over-indulge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "news_keywords": "Why,liberal,make,drink,Americans,living,Democrat,states,likely,binge,spirits,beer", "original-source": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2541705/Why-liberal-make-drink-Americans-living-Democrat-states-likely-binge-spirits-beer.html", "doc-class": "Living Document", "twitter": {"description": "US researchers from Pittsburgh University have found that as congressmen and women vote Democrat, the states they represent are more likely to drink alcohol.", "title": "Liberals drink more: Americans in Democrat states more likely to binge", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2541705/Why-liberal-make-drink-Americans-living-Democrat-states-likely-binge-spirits-beer.html", "app": {"id": {"ipad": 400442503, "iphone": 384101264}}, "image": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/01/18/article-2541705-14C6070F000005DC-997_636x382.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "account_id": 15438913}, "robots": "noodp,noydir,all,noarchive", "msvalidate.01": "12E6B4B813EB44C9BFC8F6A21F1D01F5", "fb": {"app_id": 146202712090395}, "MSSmartTagsPreventParsing": "true", "articleid": 2541705, "divclasspage": "articlePage", "keywords": "Why,liberal,make,drink,Americans,living,Democrat,states,likely,binge,spirits,beer", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMail", "published_time": "2014-01-18T10:44:50.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "author": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/search.html?s=&authornamef=Chris+Pleasance", "section": "News", "modified_time": "2014-01-18T17:48:41.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "tag": "Why liberal make drink Americans living Democrat states likely binge spirits beer"}, "verify-v1": "DXwlrsxbqxSv+FTFkWUfgflBvFJfx2YbNf/HmABrVyY=", "y_key": "1a7e912afbfcab2f", "og": {"site_name": "Mail Online", "description": "US researchers from Pittsburgh University have found that as congressmen and women vote Democrat, the states they represent are more likely to drink alcohol.", "title": "Liberals drink more: Americans in Democrat states more likely to binge", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2541705/Why-liberal-make-drink-Americans-living-Democrat-states-likely-binge-spirits-beer.html", "image": {"width": 636, "identifier": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/01/18/article-2541705-14C6070F000005DC-997_636x382.jpg", "height": 382}, "type": "article"}, "channel": "News", "description": "US researchers from Pittsburgh University have found that as congressmen and women vote Democrat, the states they represent are more likely to drink alcohol."}, "article_summary": "Researchers in the US found that as congressmen and women voted Democrat, the people living in their states began to drink more -
