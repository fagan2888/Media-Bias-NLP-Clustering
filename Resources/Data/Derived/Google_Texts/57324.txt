FORT COLLINS — After throwing for 390 yards and five touchdowns against Wyoming Saturday, Colorado State quarterback Garrett Grayson Monday was named the Mountain West’s offensive player of the week.

It’s the first time he has been the choice during his four-season career. That’s almost hard to believe.

Grayson also was 18-for-21 against the Cowboys, and his passing efficiency rating of 320.29 nationally is the highest in a game this season — 43 points better than Baylor’s Seth Russell.

The College Football Performance Awards also named Grayson its National Quarterback of the Week.

Here’s my Monday column on Grayson, with a link to a preseason profile as well in it.
