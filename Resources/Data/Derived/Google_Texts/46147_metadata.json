He made fun of the large, and growing, Republican presidential field. He hung out with Girl Scouts camping on the south lawn of the White House.\n\nAnd, on a more serious note, Mr. Obama got to announce the next step toward fulfilling a long-held goal \u2013 normal relations between the United States and Cuba. As of July 20, each country will have an embassy in the other\u2019s capital.\n\nMuch has been made of the president\u2019s \u201cbest week ever\u201d \u2013 now extending into a second week, or, in the eyes of some, an entire month \u2013 but an added bonus for Obama is that he actually seems to be having fun.\n\nRecommended: Barack Obama: How well do you know America's 44th president?\n\nNobody ever said being president would be easy, and there are ways in which it must be downright excruciating \u2013 the mass shootings, the constant threat of Islamic terrorism, the times when Congress stands in the way of one\u2019s vision of progress. Presidents get visibly grayer during their tenure for a reason.\n\nBut 6-1/2 years into his presidency, Obama is on the homestretch, and key elements of his legacy seem secure. The economic recovery is taking root, the Affordable Care Act is intact, and the right to same-sex marriage is the law of the land. Increasingly, the famously cool native of Hawaii is letting himself relax a bit in public.\n\n\u201cIs your name really Davy Crockett?\u201d Obama asked a man at an event Wednesday in Nashville, Tenn.\n\nYes, it was \u2013 just like the 19th-century folk hero who represented Tennessee in Congress and died at the Alamo.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a cool name. But you don\u2019t have that beaver cap,\u201d said Obama, suddenly a stand-up comedian.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got one at the house,\u201d Mr. Crockett replied.\n\nAfter Crockett asked a question \u2013 a serious one, about his inability to get Social Security \u2013 and Obama\u2019s serious reply, the president got a mischievous grin on his face and sang a few bars of the theme song from the old \u201cDavy Crockett\u201d TV show.\n\nIt was the second time in a week that Obama sang in public. Last Friday, under the most somber of circumstances, he led surprised mourners in singing \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d at the end of his eulogy for the Rev. Clementa Pinckney, the pastor who died in a mass shooting last month at a black church in Charleston, S.C.\n\nIn that moment, Obama shed some of his caution in publicly embracing his role as the first black president.\n\nObama\u2019s relaxed public demeanor carried into his press conference Tuesday with Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff, when he joked about her gift of a yellow and green sweat shirt with \u201cBrazil\u201d on the back.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t wear that in public because I have to root for the USA,\u201d he quipped, referring to the Olympic Games next summer in Rio de Janeiro. \u201cBut at home, at night, it\u2019s very comfortable. So who knows, I might slip it on.\u201d\n\nObama also joked about how much he loves giving press conferences, and he waxed poetic about the sight last Friday evening of the White House bathed in rainbow light after the US Supreme Court ruling legalizing gay marriage nationwide.\n\n\u201cThat made it a really good week,\u201d Obama said. \u201cTo see people gathered in an evening outside on a beautiful summer night and to feel whole and to feel accepted and to feel that they had a right to love, that was pretty cool.\u201d\n\nBut it was Obama\u2019s trip to La Crosse, Wis., Thursday that was the most baldly political of the past few weeks. The state\u2019s Republican governor, Scott Walker, is expected to announce his presidential campaign July 13, and Obama\u2019s decision to stage an event in Wisconsin that was focused on overtime pay seemed aimed right at Governor Walker\u2019s war with labor unions.\n\nWalker greeted Obama with a smile at the La Crosse regional airport \u2013 a photo op made in heaven for the political press.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I) of Vermont, the favorite of the Democratic left for the party\u2019s presidential nomination, had staged a campaign rally in the state capital, Madison, the night before and had attracted 10,000 people \u2013 the largest rally for any candidate yet this cycle.\n\nObama only alluded to Senator Sanders\u2019s spirited challenge to Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton in his remarks, but he had a lot to say about the Republicans.\n\n\"Every single one of them is still obsessed with repealing the Affordable Care Act, despite the fact that by every measure it's working,\" Obama said. \u201cIt just seems a little mean to say that you don\u2019t want to provide coverage to 16 million people. And you\u2019ve got nothing to replace it with.\u201d\n\nObama also had some fun at the expense of the GOP\u2019s 14-candidate-and-counting presidential field.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got some healthy competition in the Democratic Party, but I\u2019ve lost count of how many Republicans are running for this job,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ll have enough for an actual \u2018Hunger Games.\u2019 That is an interesting bunch.\u201d\n\nIt was a campaign-style event, with Obama trotting out some lines clearly aimed at Walker, though not by name.\n\n\u201cWe have to protect and not attack a worker\u2019s right to organize,\u201d Obama said.\n\nObama\u2019s done running for office, but the 2016 elections matter vitally to his legacy. He\u2019ll be out there campaigning as much as Democrats want him to, and it\u2019s a safe bet that he hopes to have some fun \u2013 and maybe get in a little singing.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.content.id": "fe848bb1378f0ddb15449bd83e7d62b5", "sailthru.author": "Linda Feldmann", "description": "President Obama sang in public again this week, hung out with the Girl Scouts, and made fun of the large Republican presidential field.", "copyright": "The Christian Science Monitor", "author": "The Christian Science Monitor", "og": {"site_name": "The Christian Science Monitor", "description": "President Obama sang in public again this week, hung out with the Girl Scouts, and made fun of the large Republican presidential field.", "title": "Obama looks like he\u2019s actually having fun being president", "url": "http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2015/0703/Obama-looks-like-he-s-actually-having-fun-being-president", "image": "http://www.csmonitor.com/extension/csm_base/design/csm_design/images/csm_logo_1200x630.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "President Obama sang in public again this week, hung out with the Girl Scouts, and made fun of the large Republican presidential field.", "site": "@csmonitor", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama looks like he\u2019s actually having fun being president"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-07-03", "DC.date.issued": "2015-07-03T16:49:44-04:00", "fb": {"page_id": 14660729657, "app_id": 179793002061452}, "sailthru.content.body": "http://www.csmonitor.com/layout/set/rssfull/USA/Politics/2015/0703/Obama-looks-like-he-s-actually-having-fun-being-president", "sailthru.tags": "section-politics,section-usa,class-article,storysource-monitor", "article": {"section": "Politics", "published_time": "2015-07-03T16:49-05"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccfd6\"", "article_summary": "President Obama sang in public again this week, hung out with the Girl Scouts, and made fun of the large Republican presidential field.\n\u201cIs your name really Davy Crockett?\u201d Obama asked a man at an event Wednesday in Nashville, Tenn.\nTo avoid the morality police, some Iranian women are dressing like menPresident Obama sang in public \u2013 again.\n\u201cThat made it a really good week,\u201d Obama said.\nIt was the second time in a week that Obama sang in public."}
