There\u2019s always daylights, sunsets, midnights and cups of coffee, as suggested in the musical Rent \u2014 or there\u2019s Democrats\u2019 failures, as suggested by the National Republican Congressional Committee.\n\nTo close out 2013, the NRCC compiled a list of the \u201c35 Biggest Democrat Fails.\u201d And there are definitely some priceless fails.\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s ObamaCare\u2019s rocky implementation, the party\u2019s sharply dropping poll numbers, or President Obama awarded the \u2018Lie of the Year,\u2019 2013 was an absolute disaster for Democrats,\u201d the post\u2019s author, Matt Gorman, told Red Alert Politics in an email. \u201cBefore we ring in 2014, it\u2019s important to look back at some of their biggest failures in the past year. 2013 may be rapidly coming to an end, but the Democrats\u2019 troubles are just beginning.\u201d\n\nOf course, the list includes some familiar favorites.\n\nThere\u2019s President Barack Obama\u2019s \u2018if you like it, you can keep it\u2019 promise, which, as Gorman pointed out, was dubbed PolitiFact\u2019s \u201cLie of the Year.\u201d\n\nAnd no one could forget the time HealthCare.gov crashed right in front of Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius.\n\nPlus, there\u2019s Rep. Alan Grayson (D-Fla.) and his burning cross email in which he compared the Tea Party to the Ku Klux Klan. (Yikes!)\n\nThis list also features some gems that might have slipped memory, such as House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi saying there are no more spending cuts to make.\n\nOr there\u2019s when Rep. Annie Kuster (D-N.H.) refused to talk about the Benghazi attack.\n\nGorman, an NRCC spokesman, chose Arizona State University professor Kyrsten Sinema as his favorite \u2018fail\u2019 on the list. Sinema helped create the Affordable Care Act, which led to the hours of ASU associate faculty being cut. Awkward.\n\nCheck out the full list on the NRCC website and let us know your favorites.
