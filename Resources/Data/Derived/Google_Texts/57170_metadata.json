The land has been kept for years as a hunting preserve by the industrialist Guggenheim family.\n\nIt\u2019s a huge swath of woods and wetlands along the Wando River where the industrial corridor gives out on Clements Ferry Road. It\u2019s a place where rare birds are spotted and remains of an historic 19th century roadway can be found.\n\nA decade ago, at Poplar Grove in Dorchester County near Ravenel, developers planned to build 5,000 homes on 4,500 acres of pineland just beyond the city of Charleston, at the marsh edge of remote Rantowles Creek and only a few wetland-and-forest miles south of the renowned Ashley River historic plantation district.\n\nEach development brought opposition from conservationists and the broader community, not so much because of what it is as where it is. The properties each are on a fringe of the Charleston, Berkeley and Dorchester counties\u2019 urban core, in places where suburbs give way to the traditional plantation and forest uses, along riverlands.\n\nAs those areas go, the groups say, so does the ability to conserve adjacent areas and eventually the wetlands-and-woods countryside that makes the place.\n\n\u201cThe people in my area are committed to land conservation for the beauty, the history, the wildlife, the open space,\u201d said Richard Coen, of Halidon Hill Plantation in the East Cooper River plantation district near the Cainhoy tract. Their ability to do that, with needed but not-always-welcomed management techniques such as managed burns, \u201cdepends on how the (Cainhoy) development unfolds.\u201d\n\nMomentum\n\nConservationists such as the Lowcountry Open Land Trust want to work with the Cainhoy developers to assure that it becomes what Elizabeth Hagood, trust executive director, called a transition area between the suburbs and open land.\n\n\u201cIt does spur additional (conservation) easements when you have a key property developed and conserved,\u201d she said. When country landowners see a large-tract neighbor trading off potential development profits to keep the land the way it is, they are more inclined to do so, she said.\n\nThat sort of momentum had just started to roll through the East Cooper area. Boeing purchased and turned over for preservation nearly 4,000 acres of the Keystone, Nebo and Fairlawn tracts, as required mitigation for filling wetlands at its North Charleston complex. The tracts are in the East Cooper countryside near Cainhoy Plantation in Berkeley County.\n\nAll three properties were rife for development. The 4,500-acre Keystone tract alone had been slated at one time for 6,500 homes to be built.\n\nPush-back\n\nThe need for that momentum was driven home by what happened at Poplar Grove. The plans for a dense development there roused wide opposition from an unlikely cadre of farmers, hunters, conservationists and everyday residents who just didn\u2019t want their country lifestyle ripped into.\n\nTheir push-back led to a scaled-down, \u201cgreener\u201d Poplar Grove. The rallied community helped conservation groups raise $10 million from private foundations and state grants to pay for conservation easements, essentially contracts that restrict how much of a property can be developed.\n\nInstead of 5,000 homes, now only 450 homes can be built. The development is now under construction, although sales have been slow. The rural nature of the place has been maintained.\n\nPoplar Grove was a watershed moment. It led to conservation easements signed by plantation owners upstream that solidified the Ashley River Historic District. And MeadWestvaco, the timber company that originally sold the Poplar Grove land, bought back a similar district tract, Watson Hill, and announced plans for \u201cgreen,\u201d or nature-based, development across nearly 80,000 acres of timberland between the Ashley and Edisto rivers.\n\nThe line\n\nThat\u2019s what conservationists would like to see happen at Cainhoy Plantation. It\u2019s on the eastern edge of an East Cooper area where 9,000 acres of private lands already have been conserved, but another 9,000 acres have not. Keystone is on the western edge.\n\nConservationists want to keep the momentum going that was galvanized by Boeing and others. Too much development of Cainhoy Plantation could be a stomp on the brakes.\n\nSome compromise is seemingly doable, for the right price.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing in the development plan that prevents areas from being conserved, said Matt Sloan, who is representing Cainhoy Land & Timber, the development company. The company is in ongoing talks with conservation groups, he said.\n\nBut they\u2019re talking from opposite sides of the profit line between the developed end of Clements Ferry Road and the plantation landscape the conservationists want to preserve.\n\n\u201cJust keep in mind that we are (developing) this infill property connecting the city (of Charleston) and Mount Pleasant. It\u2019s a busy place,\u201d Sloan added.\n\nHagood said that while the Cainhoy Plantation happens to be in the city of Charleston\u2019s jurisdiction, it\u2019s in a traditional plantation area where millions of dollars already have been invested in conservation.\n\n\u201cEnvironment and business interests should not be in conflict,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s important that where we build be planned in connection to what we protect.\u201d\n\nReach Bo Petersen at 937-5744, @bopete on twitter or Bo Petersen Reporting on Facebook.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Cainhoy Plantation, where potential clash between development, conservation looms, FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nMetro,", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "To understand the pivotal importance of preserving the Cainhoy Plantation landscape to conservationists, it helps to remember Poplar Grove.", "title": "Cainhoy Plantation, where potential clash between development, conservation looms", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20140119/140119365/cainhoy-plantation-where-potential-clash-between-development-conservation-looms", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20140119/PC16/140119365/AR/0/AR-140119365.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20140119/PC16/140119365/AR/0/AR-140119365.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "To understand the pivotal importance of preserving the Cainhoy Plantation landscape to conservationists, it helps to remember Poplar Grove.", "title": "Cainhoy Plantation, where potential clash between development, conservation looms", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20140119/PC16/140119365/AR/0/AR-140119365.jpg?201401192226", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 140119365}}, "keywords": "Cainhoy Plantation, where potential clash between development, conservation looms , FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nMetro", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-19T22:00:00Z", "modified_time": "2014-01-19T22:26:00Z", "author": "Bo Petersen"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "To understand the pivotal importance of preserving the Cainhoy Plantation landscape to conservationists, it helps to remember Poplar Grove."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdfef\"", "article_summary": "To understand the pivotal importance of preserving the Cainhoy Plantation landscape to conservationists, it helps to remember Poplar Grove.\nThere\u2019s nothing in the development plan that prevents areas from being conserved, said Matt Sloan, who is representing Cainhoy Land & Timber, the development company.\nThe tracts are in the East Cooper countryside near Cainhoy Plantation in Berkeley County.\nToo much development of Cainhoy Plantation could be a stomp on the brakes.\nHagood said that while the Cainhoy Plantation happens to be in the city of Charleston\u2019s jurisdiction, it\u2019s in a traditional plantation area where millions of dollars already have been invested in conservation."}
