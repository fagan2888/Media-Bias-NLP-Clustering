The Rockies sacrificed an all-star shortstop meant to lead them to the post- season in favor of setting up what they hope is a better future.\n\nIn the wake of Tulowitzki\u2019s trade to the Toronto Blue Jays, in return for three pitching prospects, and the call-up of touted rookie pitcher Jon Gray, the Rockies have eyes on youngsters setting up to crack the major leagues.\n\nAnd it won\u2019t be Colorado\u2019s first turn at making its fans wait for a contender. In 2005, after trading right fielder Larry Walker to the St. Louis Cardinals, the Rockies stocked their roster with a team of 20-somethings. They started a marketing campaign titled \u201cGeneration R,\u201d playing up the shift toward youth.\n\nCall this \u201cGeneration R.2\u201d if you want. But the Rockies don\u2019t call it a rebuild.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a word we use around here,\u201d general manager Jeff Bridich said. \u201cTo \u2018rebuild\u2019 says that we\u2019re going to sell whatever assets we have at the major-league level just to say we\u2019re rebuilding or getting rid of guys just for the sake of change.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Stephen Strasburg dominant for Nationals in return from DL, beats Rockies\n\nWhether it\u2019s rebuilding, rebranding, restocking or reviving, the Rockies are really invested in their prospect pipeline.\n\nHere are the names \u2014 just like Tulowitzki, Garrett Atkins, Jeff Francis, Brad Hawpe and Clint Barmes in 2005 \u2014 who are nearing the major leagues and, the Rockies hope, ready to help turn around a team headed toward its fifth consecutive last or second-to-last place finish in the NL West.\n\nSS TREVOR STORY, 22\n\nStory\u2019s story is an exercise in tempering expectations. Within a week in mid-July, Story had six multihit games, including a two-homer, four-RBI night and two three-hit games. But he has cooled off since and entered Saturday hitting .259 in the Pacific Coast League.\n\nThe Rockies were willing to take on Jose Reyes\u2019 $24 million-per-year contract in the Tulo- witzki trade because they needed a shortstop. Story isn\u2019t ready.\n\nBut his call-up, perhaps in September when big-league rosters expand, might plop him at any one of three infield positions. Story advanced through the Rockies\u2019 system as a shortstop, but he could be better suited as a second baseman.\n\n\u201cNobody has a crystal ball here to know what the opportunity on the major-league level will eventually be,\u201d Bridich said. \u201cYou don\u2019t truly know until you see a guy do it at this level.\u201d\n\nOF DAVID DAHL, 21\n\nDahl\u2019s visit to a hospital emergency room in May \u2014 after he collided with a teammate in the outfield while chasing a flyball \u2014 led to his spleen being removed. But it didn\u2019t set his progress back.\n\nDahl returned to Double-A New Britain about six weeks later. He needs to catch up with playing time. And he\u2019s striking out too much \u2014 once every four at-bats this season.\n\nBut \u201che has a chance to be a five-tool player,\u201d said Rockies farm director Zach Wilson. \u201cSo all those tools are still developing.\u201d\n\nThe 10th overall pick in the 2010 draft coming out of high school, the Alabama native fast-tracked to Double-A. He is the youngest player on the Rock Cats\u2019 roster.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s very young for that league,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s still a lot he needs to do to prepare himself.\u201d\n\nLHP KYLE FREELAND, 22\n\nThe race is on between Jeff Hoffman, the right-hander the Rockies received in the Tulo- witzki trade, and Freeland, a former standout at Thomas Jefferson High School in Denver.\n\nBoth are 22. Both are coming off arm injuries. Hoffman had Tommy John surgery and Freeland had bone chips removed from his elbow. But Freeland, the No. 8 overall pick in the 2014 draft, has pitched with more maturity than his age.\n\n\u201cThe things that make Kyle Kyle is he\u2019s polished in a lot of ways,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cAs an amateur, he had very good command of his fastball. And it\u2019s only gotten better. But he needs innings.\u201d\n\nC TOM MURPHY, 24\n\nJim Tracy, who managed the Rockies to their most recent postseason appearance, in 2009, recently coached Team USA at the Pan American Games in Toronto. His catcher was 24-year-old Murphy \u2014 the Rockies\u2019 top backstop prospect.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a very good defensive catcher,\u201d Tracy told The Denver Post last week. \u201cHe\u2019ll play in the major leagues.\u201d\n\nMurphy\u2019s ascension was slowed some by a shoulder injury last year, but he was promoted to Triple-A on July 23 and is hitting .261 with regular playing time.\n\nNick Groke: ngroke@denverpost.com or twitter.com/nickgroke", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Rockies now in wait-and-see mode with prospect pipeline", "title": "Rockies now in wait-and-see mode with prospect pipeline", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/08/08/rockies-now-in-wait-and-see-mode-with-prospect-pipeline/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150808__20150809_C5_SP09BBNROCKIESENTERp3.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150808__20150809_C5_SP09BBNROCKIESENTERp3.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-08T20:14:26+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T10:20:09+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe things that make Kyle Kyle is he\u2019s polished in a lot of ways,\u201d Wilson said.\nThe Rockies sacrificed an all-star shortstop meant to lead them to the post- season in favor of setting up what they hope is a better future.\nIn 2005, after trading right fielder Larry Walker to the St. Louis Cardinals, the Rockies stocked their roster with a team of 20-somethings.\nStory advanced through the Rockies\u2019 system as a shortstop, but he could be better suited as a second baseman.\nThe Rockies were willing to take on Jose Reyes\u2019 $24 million-per-year contract in the Tulo- witzki trade because they needed a shortstop."}
