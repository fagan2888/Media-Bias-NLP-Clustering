Kansas City police have confirmed that an SUV involved in the death of a teenager outside a Somali community center had an anti-Muslim message displayed in the rear window at the time of the crash.

Authorities say 34-year-old Ahmed H. Aden deliberately ran the boy over and have charged him with murder in a case that the FBI is investigating as a potential hate crime.

Fifteen-year-old Abdisamad Sheikh-Hussein died at a hospital Thursday evening.

Kansas City police spokesman Darin Snapp told The Associated Press in an email that the SUV had been seen in the area by patrol officers in late October with a message that compared the Quran to the Ebola virus.

Aden was held in jail Saturday. No attorney is listed for him in online court records.
