Patients, a good many of them immigrants without health insurance, are charged nothing for the care they receive.\n\nGiven the austere nature of the mission, someone walking in the door might expect the waiting and reception areas, the halls and the exam rooms to be clinical and plain.\n\nBut for the donations by acclaimed Sonoma County artists Marsha Connell and Sally Baker, they would be.\n\nIt\u2019s not coincidental that Connell, the landscape and abstract artist who chairs the county\u2019s ArtTrails open-studio program, is married to Dr. Jerry Connell. The retired family doctor was an early volunteer medical director with the 15-year-old clinic.\n\nSaid his wife the artist, \u201cI was always wishing I could do something for the clinic.\u201d\n\nShe found that something when she perceived that the walls pleaded for art. Several of the 15 or so pieces Connell contributed are lavish landscapes of Sonoma County scenes.\n\nThe total effect is an environment far more inviting and calming than anyone would reasonably anticipate upon entering a free health clinic.\n\n\u201cOur medical offices should look exactly like any other medical offices,\u201d Waldman said.\n\nIt helps that the building on Montgomery Drive, just west of Santa Rosa Memorial Hospital, is not some beggarly space, but the smartly designed and well maintained former home of a prosthetics practice.\n\nThe clinic operated within a smaller location in Rohnert Park when the owners of the Montgomery Drive building did something grand two and a half years ago: they donated it for the benefit of people without health insurance or the ability to pay for health care.\n\n\u201cThis is more than double what we had,\u201d Waldman said of the space.\n\nThe Jewish Community Free Clinic is open about 25 hours a week, and its volunteers see between 1,500 and 2,000 patients a year. That\u2019s 500 to 1,000 fewer patients than eight and nine years ago, when the recession was in force and the federal Affordable Care Act wasn\u2019t yet enacted and offering coverage to the uninsured.\n\nThat law \u201chas absolutely, positively helped many of our clients,\u201d Waldman said. Yet, the clinic\u2019s safety-net services continue to be essential to people who remain without health insurance, or who come down with a medical issue and don\u2019t have a doctor to turn to.\n\nMany impoverished people also look to the clinic for vaccines, prescription medications other than painkillers, pre-employment physicals and women\u2019s health services. People who come in with chronic illnesses are referred to one of the county\u2019s low-cost community health centers.\n\nThough no one is charged for the care received at the Montgomery Drive clinic, Waldman said it often happens that grateful former patients will send in donations when they\u2019re able to. The other operating funds come from philanthropic gifts and fundraisers.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Can art heal?Champions of what\u2019s been called a miracle of a Santa", "story version": 2016, "og": {"site_name": "Santa Rosa Press Democrat", "description": "The colorful artwork adoring the walls of the Jewish Community Free Clinic in Santa Rosa creates a far more inviting and calming atmosphere than anyone might anticipate at a health clinic.", "title": "Jewish Community Free Clinic in Santa Rosa brightens patients' visits with art", "url": "http://www.pressdemocrat.com/news/5643546-181/jewish-community-free-clinic-in", "image": "http://www.pressdemocrat.com/csp/mediapool/sites/dt.common.streams.StreamServer.cls?STREAMOID=L8BraW4wIT_OGHL0BLE_2s$daE2N3K4ZzOUsqbU5sYv6_ZMGU23rQOByd_mkzbkfWCsjLu883Ygn4B49Lvm9bPe2QeMKQdVeZmXF$9l$4uCZ8QDXhaHEp3rvzXRJFdy0KqPHLoMevcTLo3h8xh70Y6N_U_CryOsw6FTOdKL_jpQ-&CONTENTTYPE=image/jpeg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100003031242373, "app_id": 125780984227497}, "msvalidate.01": "9E66801B649686495190ABE3DA8985E7", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressdemocrat", "published_time": "2016-05-22T18:07:00-08:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd673a\"", "article_summary": "\u201cArt lifts the spirit of this place,\u201d said Donna Waldman, director and co-founder of the Jewish Community Free Clinic on Montgomery Drive.\nThe total effect is an environment far more inviting and calming than anyone would reasonably anticipate upon entering a free health clinic.\nThe Jewish Community Free Clinic is open about 25 hours a week, and its volunteers see between 1,500 and 2,000 patients a year.\nPatients, a good many of them immigrants without health insurance, are charged nothing for the care they receive.\nThough no one is charged for the care received at the Montgomery Drive clinic, Waldman said it often happens that grateful former patients will send in donations when they\u2019re able to."}
