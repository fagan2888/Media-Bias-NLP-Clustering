The outage comes only days after President Obama said that the U.S. \u201cwill respond proportionally\u201d to North Korea regarding the FBI\u2019s allegations that the solitary nation was responsible for the immense hack on Sony Pictures Entertainment.\n\nThe North Korean internet outage was spotted by Dyn Research\u2019s director of Internet analysis Doug Madory who told several news organizations that the country\u2019s four networks that connect to the rest of the internet were offline. Bloomberg News noted that North Korea\u2019s four networks (in comparison, the U.S. has over 152,000 similar networks) all pass through China.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMadory was not able to declare whether someone was indeed hacking North Korea, but he told Bloomberg News, \u201cIt is kind of out of the ordinary. This is not like anything I\u2019ve seen before.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Dyn Research director gave a few more details to the New York Times saying that the outage appears similar to what occurs during a DDoS attack, in which network routers are bombarded with so much traffic, they end up failing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCloudFlare CEO Matthew Prince also confirmed to the New York Times that North Korea\u2019s internet is offline.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConsidering North Korea\u2019s general populace does not have regular access to the web, the country\u2019s citizens aren\u2019t probably feeling the effects of the outage, according to the Times. North Korea\u2019s elite and its cyber army are probably reeling, however.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf it turns out that the U.S. is responsible for bringing down the North Korean internet, the Times noted that it would be quite a shift for the U.S. as most cases of U.S. cyber espionage center around the collecting of data, not the shutting down of systems.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA U.S. State Department spokeswoman told Washington reporters that the U.S. is unable to confirm the hacking reports on North Korea, and she wouldn\u2019t outline how the U.S. plans to respond to the original Sony hack.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.title": "North Korea\u2019s internet takes a hit on Monday", "application-name": "Gigaom", "dcterms.modified": "2014-12-22", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "dcterms.creator": "Jonathan Vanian", "dcterms.date": "2014-12-22", "keywords": "cloudflare, ddos attack, department of state, doug madory, dyn, dyn research, federal bureau of investigation, hacking, internet outage, matthew prince, network routers, security", "news_keywords": "cloudflare, ddos attack, department of state, doug madory, dyn, federal bureau of investigation, hacking, internet outage, matthew prince, security", "author": "Jonathan Vanian", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "theme-color": "#ecebe6", "dcterms.publisher": "Gigaom", "description": "North Korea\u2019s internet went down on Monday, following a weekend of spotty coverage, according to multiple news reports.
