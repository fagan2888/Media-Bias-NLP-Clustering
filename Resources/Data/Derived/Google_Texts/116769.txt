In Vermont, a man has filed a lawsuit in federal court against the Department of Vermont Health Access after they forced him to choose between his pro-life beliefs and insurance coverage. The plaintiff, Alan Lyle Howe, says the state offered heath plans force him to include a fee for abortion coverage even though he is against abortion and will never obtain one. Vermont, along with Rhode Island, New Jersey, Hawaii, don’t allow citizens to opt out of coverage for elective abortion in Obamacare.

Howe refused to enroll and instead filed suit because he believes paying the fee would undermine his public opposition to abortion. His lawyer, Casey Mattox, said, “We’re putting together legal arguments and we’ll be filing, we expect, in a week. When government is imposing burdens like that on people … that’s a violation of free exercise, and that’s essentially what’s happening here.” She added that she and her clients were working “in good faith” with all other parties to work toward an outcome other than litigation.

Additionally, Howe’s lawyers are asking for a solution for Howe and others like him who would be abandoning their beliefs to obtain health care. According to the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO), in September 2014, 15 states offered some health insurance options without the elective abortion payment, and eight other states offer plans that do not cover elective abortions.

As LifeNews previously reported, in 2010 President Obama promised the American people that the Obamacare bill maintained the Hyde Amendment, which ensured that no public funding went to abortion. However, last year the GAO found that taxpayers are funding over a thousand Obamacare health plans that subsidize abortion on demand—even late-term abortion—in defiance of the Hyde Amendment Obama publicly said he would honor.
