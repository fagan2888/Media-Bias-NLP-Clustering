The homes will be spaced apart and there is green land, as well as a play park, in the proposals.\n\n\u201cThe homes we are looking at are of high quality.\u201d\n\nLinden Homes said it is working with the Blunsdon Neighbourhood Plan Working Group and if the development is approved there will be Section 106 money available for community facilities.\n\nSome residents are concerned about extra traffic in the area, especially as Cold Harbour junction is already busy during rush hour.\n\nLinden said it is aware of the issue and has commissioned a survey to look at possible solutions.\n\nTom added: \u201cAt this stage we cannot say for definite what will go there but we are aware of the issue and are looking at solutions which will be in place before an application is put in.\n\n\u201cThe entrance will come out onto High Street where there is already a road.\u201d\n\nResident Jim Hyland attended the meeting with his wife Carol. He said: \u201cOn the whole it is well parcelled in so we are not too concerned about where it is.\n\n\u201cThe one main worry I do have is the houses will not fit in with the rest of the houses.\n\n\u201cThe houses in Blunsdon all have an old look, even the new ones, so I am a little worried the development will spoil the look of the village.\n\n\u201cThe roads will also have to be upgraded to cope with all the traffic.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "description": "PLANS for a further housing development in Blunsdon were put before residents yesterday.", "title": "Residents have say on bid for 69 homes", "og": {"site_name": "This Is Wiltshire", "name": "Residents have say on bid for 69 homes", "title": "Residents have say on bid for 69 homes", "url": "http://www.thisiswiltshire.co.uk/news/11263037.Residents_have_say_on_bid_for_69_homes/", "image": "http://www.thisiswiltshire.co.uk/resources/images/3067540/", "type": "website", "description": "PLANS for a further housing development in Blunsdon were put before residents yesterday."}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.thisiswiltshire.co.uk/resources/images/3067540/"}, "description": "PLANS for a further housing development in Blunsdon were put before residents yesterday.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Residents have say on bid for 69 homes"}, "fb": {"app_id": 168340853216948}, "vr": {"category": "News", "type": "Text"}, "news_keywords": "Local, , Residents Have Say On Bid For 69 Homes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca365\"", "article_summary": "Linden Homes outlined a proposal to build 69 homes off Ermin Street, 30 per cent of which will be affordable, during the public consultation at Blunsdon House Hotel.\nBy Mike Benke, @Michael_BenkePLANS for a further housing development in Blunsdon were put before residents yesterday.\nThe homes will be spaced apart and there is green land, as well as a play park, in the proposals.\nSome residents are concerned about extra traffic in the area, especially as Cold Harbour junction is already busy during rush hour.\n\u201cThis is the final pocket of land around Ermin Street and it is currently agricultural land which is not being used for anything in particular."}
