This is sure one of them. Because we mourn the brutal and irrational execution of two young, promising, devoted police officers, Rafael Ramon and Wenjian Liu,\u201d Cardinal Dolan said to a packed crowd of worshippers, tourists and media.\n\nThe two officers were shot\u2014\u201dassassinated,\u201d as the mayor and police commissioner put it\u2014through the window of their patrol car by 28-year-old Ismaaiyl Brinsley, who posted on social media that he was out for revenge for the police-related deaths of unarmed black men, Eric Garner and Michael Brown. The murder of the officers comes at a time of already heightened tensions between community, police and City Hall, amid days of protests after a grand jury opted not to indict an officer in Garner\u2019s death. Police officers turned their backs on the mayor last night at Woodhull Medical Center; the police union has blamed the rhetoric of the protesters, and the mayor, for the deaths.\n\nCardinal Dolan\u2014to whom Mr. de Blasio has turned before, including shortly after Garner\u2019s death\u2014made brief mention of that rising division in the city.\n\n\u201cAs we tear up thinking about their heartbroken families, as we are in solidarity with our police officers, who themselves experienced a death in the family. And yes, as we worry about a city tempted to tension and division, good news this morning might seem distant, difficult, even somewhat indiscreet,\u201d Cardinal Dolan said. \u201cHere we are anticipating the joy of Christmas, and we feel like we\u2019re nearer to Good Friday.\u201d\n\nBut even as he referenced the crucifixion of Christ, the darkest day of the church\u2019s year, Cardinal Dolan said the good news of God is never erased, \u201cfor a believer.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo I propose to you this morning, more than ever, we need a little Christmas right this very moment,\u201d he said.\n\nThe spiritual leader of New York\u2019s Catholics delivered his remarks just as another, more controversial preacher, Rev. Al Sharpton, addressed the media this morning. But while Mr. de Blasio has been attacked by police unions for his relationship with Mr. Sharpton, seen by many as divisive, it was Cardinal Dolan with whom the mayor chose to appear. Mr. de Blasio and his wife Chirlane McCray rose during communion, walked to the altar and knelt, where they received a blessing. He made no comments to the media after the mass.\n\nIn his sermon, Cardinal Dolan made note of today, December 21, being the darkest of the year\u2014and said that, for years, civilizations feared what would follow, only to find the sun would rise again. Believer in Jesus Christ, he said, are also taught to trust that light will conquer darkness.\n\n\u201cAnd when we\u2019re tempted to question that as stupid and silly, he whispers, \u2018Be not afraid.\u2019 Fear is useless. What is needed is trust,\u201d Cardinal Dolan said.\n\nCardinal Dolan has spoken out about the ongoing tensions in the city before, penning an editorial in the Daily News urging unity and decrying both protesters using anti-police rhetoric and police unions who called on the mayor not to attend police funerals just days before these deaths.\n\nToday he spoke personally about how he learned of the death of the officers: from police officers assigned to provide security on a visit he was making to a Bronx church yesterday.\n\n\u201cInstead of their characteristically buoyant greeting to me, I found them somber and downcast. And I went over to them and said, \u2018Fellas, what\u2019s wrong?\u2019 And they told me, the first I had heard of it\u2014the chilling news of the execution of their two members,\u201d Cardinal Dolan said.\n\nHe asked the officers to take him over to the 46th Precinct across the street. There, he said, he met with officers, praying with them and embracing them, trying to console them. It was, as the mayor observed yesterday, \u201ca death in the family\u201d for them, Cardinal Dolan said.\n\nCardinal Dolan went back to the church, \u201cstumbling through mass in Spanish,\u201d he said. But caught out of the corner of his eyes two police officers on bended knee, hats on the floor, praying.\n\n\u201cAnd I silently prayed that they would hear those words that Mary heard, deep down: \u2018Be not afraid. I am with you,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nCardinal Dolan turned to Mr. Bratton and Chief of Department James O\u2019Neill, seated next to the commissioner.\n\n\u201cCommissioner Bratton and Chief O\u2019Neill, would you tell your officers that God\u2019s people gathered in St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral this morning thundered with prayer with and for them, that we love them very much, we mourn with them, we need them, we respect them, and we\u2019re proud of them and we thank them? Would you tell them that, Commissioner Bratton and Chief O\u2019Neill?\u201d Cardinal Dolan asked, before turning to the congregation. \u201cAm I correct in thinking that that\u2019s your sentiment everyone?\u201d\n\nMr. Bratton nodded. The cavernous church filled with thunderous applause.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Capitol Confidential", "description": "Cardinal Timothy Dolan delivered a moving sermon as Mayor Bill de Blasio and Police Commissioner Bill Bratton sat in the front pew.", "title": "After Murder of NYPD Officers, de Blasio and Bratton Mourn With Cardinal Dolan", "url": "http://blog.timesunion.com/capitol/archives/226425/after-murder-of-nypd-officers-de-blasio-and-bratton-attend-mass-with-cardinal-dolan/", "image": "http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=observer.com&blog=35584880&post=443523&subd=nyoobserver&ref=&feed=1", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-21T18:28:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-21T18:28:16+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary"}, "NextGEN": "1.7.5", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb895\"", "article_summary": "Cardinal Dolan turned to Mr. Bratton and Chief of Department James O\u2019Neill, seated next to the commissioner.\nWould you tell them that, Commissioner Bratton and Chief O\u2019Neill?\u201d Cardinal Dolan asked, before turning to the congregation.\nAs he took to the pulpit, Cardinal Dolan spoke about the good news the church is set to deliver on Christmas.\nCardinal Dolan went back to the church, \u201cstumbling through mass in Spanish,\u201d he said.\nBecause we mourn the brutal and irrational execution of two young, promising, devoted police officers, Rafael Ramon and Wenjian Liu,\u201d Cardinal Dolan said to a packed crowd of worshippers, tourists and media."}
