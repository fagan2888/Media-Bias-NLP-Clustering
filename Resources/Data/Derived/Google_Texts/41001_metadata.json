The native animals are critically endangered, and are found in just two pockets in the wild, in the Grampians and East Gippsland.\n\nThere is an estimate that just 40 of the wallabies still survive in the wild in these areas, with the rest bred in captivity as part of the breeding program.\n\nTo increase the chances of survival of the species, Tidbinbilla's wildlife officers have pioneered an accelerated breeding technique called cross-fostering. This is where the joey of southern brush-tailed rock wallaby is removed from its mother and placed in the pouch of a similar species, in the case at Tidbinbilla, the yellow-footed rock wallaby.\n\nThe technique allows the female southern brush-tailed rock wallabies to produce anywhere from four to eight joeys per year. Naturally, the female would produce one and a half joeys each year.\n\nACT Parks and Conservation senior wildlife officer Scott Ryan said hand-raising Shadow, one of 27 of the animals at Tidbinbilla, was a good opportunity for the breeding program.\n\nMr Ryan said he hoped to conduct exclusive encounters with the little macropod to allow the community to connect with the program.\n\n\"He's really crucial for this community interaction and engagement and hopefully we can use that to help promote the plight of the rock wallaby,\" Mr Ryan said.\n\n\"People will be able to see a rock wallaby up close. These guys are often referred to as 'the shadow', hence his name, because in the wild they are very difficult to see and observe, and they're very shy as well.\"\n\nHowever, Shadow is not at all shy. He ricochets off the walls at the captive breeding centre, playfully climbing on shoulders and sitting in laps.\n\n\"I adore Shadow,\" Mr Ryan said.\n\n\"All of the staff here do, and pretty much anyone who has an interaction with Shadow just love him. He's adorable, he's got a lot of character, he is a little man so there is a little bit of cheekiness to him but for the most part he does enjoy our interactions but only for a short period, he is still a rock wallaby at the end of the day.\"\n\nThe current aim for the southern brush-tailed rock wallaby breeding program is to increase the captive population to 200 before releasing more of the macropods into the wild in Victoria.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "ACT News, Animals", "application-name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "og": {"site_name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "description": "Meet Shadow, one of Canberra's best-kept and most adorable secrets.", "title": "Southern brush tailed rock wallaby breeding program successful at Tidbinbilla in ACT", "url": "http://www.smh.com.au/environment/animals/southern-brush-tailed-rock-wallaby-breeding-program-successful-at-tidbinbilla-in-act-20150808-giulev.html", "image": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/g/i/u/m/e/0/image.related.socialLead.620x349.giulev.png/1450835244558.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/g/i/u/m/e/0/image.related.socialLead.620x349.giulev.png/1450835244558.jpg"}, "description": "Meet Shadow, one of Canberra's best-kept and most adorable secrets.", "site": "@smh", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Southern brush tailed rock wallaby breeding program successful at Tidbinbilla in ACT"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Open The Sydney Morning Herald", "robots": "ACAP allow-present prohibited-modification=annotation", "fb": {"app_id": 193677504039845}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.smh.com.au", "msapplication-task": "name=Weather;action-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/weather;icon-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/favicon.ico;", "description": "Meet Shadow, one of Canberra's best-kept and most adorable secrets."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe10b9\"", "article_summary": "This is where the joey of southern brush-tailed rock wallaby is removed from its mother and placed in the pouch of a similar species, in the case at Tidbinbilla, the yellow-footed rock wallaby.\nShadow lives in the depths of the Tidbinbilla Nature Park at the breeding centre where the southern brush-tailed rock wallaby recovery program is well underway.\nThe technique allows the female southern brush-tailed rock wallabies to produce anywhere from four to eight joeys per year.\nThe current aim for the southern brush-tailed rock wallaby breeding program is to increase the captive population to 200 before releasing more of the macropods into the wild in Victoria.\nAt about 10 months old, he is one of just 80 southern brush-tailed rock wallabies left in the world, both in captivity and in the wild."}
