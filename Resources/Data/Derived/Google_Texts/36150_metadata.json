In addition to the rising spend in health care, \u201cwe\u2019re finding new and better ways to make diagnostic imaging more appropriate and more beneficial for physicians, and it\u2019s going to get used more.\u201d And diagnostic imaging isn\u2019t cheap.\n\nThe direct effect on imaging today is not what we will see tomorrow, Baker explained. Historically, Baker said, MEDPAC and CMS told us that we were being paid too much and we weren\u2019t differentiating our quality and value. The 2014 report remedied this by implementing a payment model based on quality and value. \u201cRadiology is struggling to understand, what is quality and value within itself,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe sooner we can identify that for ourselves, the better prepared we\u2019ll be to be able to differentiate our pricing and services,\u201d Baker said. \u201cWithout doing that, the immediate effect is they\u2019re lowering what they reimburse to us.\u201d\n\nBaker noted that the 2014 MEDPAC report called for equal pricing among hospital outpatient facilities and physician-owned facilities. \u201cIt\u2019s not equal today, by any stretch,\u201d he said. For example, according to the report, Medicare pays $453 for a level II echocardiogram in an outpatient facility, versus $189 to a freestanding physician office.\n\nBaker said this doesn\u2019t mean Medicare will start paying the physician office more, it will lower what hospitals are paid. \u201cThis is going to have a huge impact, not just for imaging, but because imaging is such an important support ancillary service for the overall hospital profitability,\u201d he said.\n\nThe problem is transparency. Or lackthereof, Baker said. \u201cNo one typically believes that transparency does them any good, no one wants to expose themselves,\u201d he said. Without transparency, though, consumers can\u2019t price compare or quality compare. Baker gave the example of scans done on high-end technology that could have been completed as accurately on a lower end model. \u201cThat\u2019s inappropriate,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve done ourselves a disservice by not rallying ourselves around and defining quality for the radiologist or for the patient, the differences between equipment and differentiating what all of that means for the primary health provider or the ordering physician of the exam,\u201d Baker said.\n\nTransparency in health care may open up the market for a slew of other concerns, but until then, \u201cquality is perception, and everyone\u2019s perception is a little bit different based on your own situation,\u201d Baker said.", "article_metadata": {"dc.date": "2014-12-15", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "[VIDEO] Radiology is struggling to understand what is quality and value."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc0fc\"", "article_summary": "The trend of growth in the population and the cost of health care is quickly unsustainable, Baker said.\nHistorically, Baker said, MEDPAC and CMS told us that we were being paid too much and we weren\u2019t differentiating our quality and value.\nThe 2014 report remedied this by implementing a payment model based on quality and value.\n\u201cRadiology is struggling to understand, what is quality and value within itself,\u201d he said.\nTransparency in health care may open up the market for a slew of other concerns, but until then, \u201cquality is perception, and everyone\u2019s perception is a little bit different based on your own situation,\u201d Baker said."}
