(AP) - In 1977, Ingrid Lundahl began photographing the rebel spirit of Telluride, for fun and as a professional.\n\nThirty-seven years later, she shares some classic moments in her recently released book \u201cTelluride: The Outlaw Spirit of a Colorado Town.\u201d\n\nWhen she arrived in the 1970s, the Sheridan bar was full of plaid shirts and duct-taped ski jackets with \u201cbeautiful women who drank one-for-one with the guys.\u201d\n\nHorses were regularly led into bars and served drinks, while obvious narcs in a red Trans Am trolled the streets looking for where \u201cThey hide up in Telluride\u201d as the Glenn Frey clich\u00e9 goes.\n\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s been seduced by Telluride. The outlaw spirit was palpable,\u201d writes Lundahl.\n\nReally not a whole lot has changed. Except that Telluride has since been \u201cdiscovered,\u201d so now celebrities rub shoulders with regular ski bums on the slopes and at bars.\n\n\u201cI would check on my town\u2019s heartbeat as my negatives hung to dry,\u201d says Lundahl.\n\nThe star sightings began soon after locals Billy Mahoney and Johnnie Stevens placed five lifts on the mountain in 1972. The Telluride Film, Blues, and Bluegrass Festivals accelerated the process.\n\nFrozen-in-time are Robert Redford, Jimmy Stewart, Laura Linney, Peter O\u2019Toole, George Clooney, and Penelope Cruz, Sean Penn, Clint Eastwood, Candice Bergen, Nicholas Cage, and Robin Williams to name a few.\n\nMusical giants are also featured prominently in the large-format photo book. Sam Bush, Bob Dylan, Jerry Garcia, Buddy Guy, David Crosby, Johnny Cash, Greg Allman, Lou Reed and Etta James are all shown performing on stage to adoring audiences.\n\nBut Lundahl clearly relishes the local characters even more. The book is mostly about regular folks living in the fast lane, or taking it easy reveling in the epic scenery and ski-town culture.\n\n\u201cWe outlaws would immobilize ourselves on benches, our faces tracked the sun, no place to go except Nirvana,\u201d she pens.\n\nThere\u2019s Rasta Stevie, notorious town council member from 1987 to 1993, and founder of the 8750 Reggae group, \u201cthe world\u2019s highest reggae band.\u201d\n\nWatch out for Navajo Sam, who would hold up hikers at gunpoint on the Woods Lake trail and make them hand over their sandwiches.\n\nSheriff Bill Masters kept the peace, and still does, while allowing citizens to live free. As sheriff, Masters famously penned a well-read book slamming the insanities of the War on Drugs.\n\nHomeboy Billy Nershi, of String Cheese Incident fame, got his start busking with his guitar in front of the Floradora. In a hilarious photo, Nershi is shown posing with General Schwarzkopf, who lived part-time in Telluride.\n\nRalph Dinosaur, a popular classic rock performer who prefers to wear women\u2019s clothing, gets kudos. In one shot he is sporting a one-piece women\u2019s swimsuit: \u201cNo one thought this was unusual.\u201d\n\nThe standard crazies of mountain towns everywhere are also featured, such as Wacky Jack, who regularly shouted profanities at great volume on the street, \u201cbizarre behavior that was tolerated and often encouraged.\u201d\n\nOr Patrick, who carried a very large wooden cross up and down Main Street for fun.\n\nLundahl chronicles the town\u2019s signature moments as well, such as ceremonial virgin sacrifices, naked ski races, town board meetings encouraging anyone to speak anytime, and the Save Our Pigs fundraiser \u201cto benefit our marshals busted for allegedly consuming cocaine from the evidence locker.\u201d\n\nLundahl does a good job documenting the heady 1980s in Telluride, \u201cbefore living in your car, a cave, in the woods, or sleeping in a free-box cubby was outlawed.\u201d\n\nShe waxes poetic about her home town.\n\n\u201cIn the heart of summer, we are breathing fresh mountain air and our country feels like a sweet land of liberty. What sealed the deal was the dazzling, in-your-face Rocky Mountains, and the outlaw spirit resounding down the slopes.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "In 1977, Ingrid Lundahl began photographing the rebel spirit of Telluride, for fun and as a professional.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/18/photographer-chronicles-tellurides-rebellious-heyd/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "In 1977, Ingrid Lundahl began photographing the rebel spirit of Telluride, for fun and as a professional.", "title": "Photographer chronicles Telluride\u2019s rebellious heyday"}, "twitter": {"description": "In 1977, Ingrid Lundahl began photographing the rebel spirit of Telluride, for fun and as a professional.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Photographer chronicles Telluride\u2019s rebellious heyday"}, "Author": "JIM MIMIAGA", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe47bf\"", "article_summary": "What sealed the deal was the dazzling, in-your-face Rocky Mountains, and the outlaw spirit resounding down the slopes.\u201d\nThe outlaw spirit was palpable,\u201d writes Lundahl.\nTELLURIDE, Colo.
