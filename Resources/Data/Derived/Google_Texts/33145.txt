There are many factors that an agent has to consider before recommending an insurance plan to a consumer. Are the client’s doctors and medications in the plan? Does the plan fit the client’s budget? What is the ethical thing to do? Most insurance agents are required by the insurance companies to carry liability insurance for their protection. Most of all most agents’ goal is to do the best they can to meet their client’s needs with the hope of building life long relationships.

So why should you use an insurance agent?

1. It’s free. It cost you nothing to use an agent. It does not affect the cost of your policy

2. An agent can make recommendations and help you to compare plans. Navigators call center representatives, and other assisters are not authorized to do this. An agent can help you to see that the cheapest plan is not always the best plan the same as the most expensive plan may not be the best plan either.

3. Insurance agents use their real names not aliases as some call centers do. They give you their contact information. You always know who you are dealing with. There is no need to repeat yourself each time you call. Good insurance agents document their calls and keep you informed about your case.

4. ACA (Affordable Care Act) Certified agents can help you solve problems with policies both on and off the exchange. They can also work as advocate for you when you have issues with the insurance company.
