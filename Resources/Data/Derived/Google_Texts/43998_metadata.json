Whether or not we can see everybody in a timely manner, that\u2019s a big unknown,\u201d says Dao.\n\nOn Thursday, CBS2 and KCAL9 radio partner KNX 1070 held an all-day public forum and town hall about Obamacare.\n\nHerb Schultz, regional director of the Health and Human Services, was on the panel.\n\n\u201cSo, do we need to train, educate and continue to grow our workforce like physicians? Absolutely,\u201d Schultz said, \u201cThere is a huge investment in the Affordable Care Act. That is already helping in Los Angeles.\u201d\n\nWhile doctors are still unclear what the ACA will mean to their business, so too are many consumers.\n\nWill health care reform drive their rates up? Or down?\n\nKaple spoke to Devin Leyva, a formerly uninsured man who has asthma. He says Obamacare is much more affordable for him.\n\n\u201cMy costs range from about $100-200,\u201d Leyva says, \u201cthat is about $200 cheaper than what I was going to pay before and that\u2019s a huge thing for me, to be honest.\u201d\n\nWith all the uncertainty surrounding the ACA, one thing is definite: You have to sign up by March 31st if you\u2019re interested. Also, if you want coverage to start on January 1, 2014 you have to sign up by December 15.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sweeping changes to the health care system are underway now that the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare, is now law.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2013/10/03/will-obamacare-lead-to-longer-wait-times-at-doctors-offices/", "image": {"width": 290, "secure_url": "https://cbsla.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/obamacare.jpg?w=290", "identifier": "https://cbsla.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/obamacare.jpg?w=290", "height": 218}, "type": "article", "description": "Sweeping changes to the health care system are underway now that the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare, is now law.", "title": "Will Obamacare Lead To Longer Wait Times At The Doctor's Office?"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://cbsla.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/obamacare.jpg?w=290", "title": "Will Obamacare Lead To Longer Wait Times At The Doctor's Office?", "description": "Sweeping changes to the health care system are underway now that the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare, is now law.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "CBSLA"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Sports, Weather, Traffic and the Best of LA/OC", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CBS Los Angeles", "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "keywords": "health, local, news, syndicated local, affordable care act, doctors, expenses, law, obamacare, premiums, rates, uncertainty, waiting time", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/CBSLA", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/CBSLA"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/5c05896c022a6d5696298ac60bad5bcf?s=16", "news_keywords": "affordable care act, doctors, expenses, law, obamacare, premiums, rates, uncertainty, waiting time"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd81c7\"", "article_summary": "LOS ANGELES (CBSLA.com) \u2014 Sweeping changes to the health care system are underway now that the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare, is now law.\nWill health care reform drive their rates up?\nAbsolutely,\u201d Schultz said, \u201cThere is a huge investment in the Affordable Care Act.\nWith hundreds of thousands of people added to the system, the inevitable question is what the impact will be at the doctor\u2019s office.\nCBS2\u2019s Bobby Kaple spoke to one doctor who wonders if the system can handle so many new patients all at once."}
