A Chicago man who lost his daughter in a car accident nine months ago is outraged after he says he received an insensitive letter in the mail from OfficeMax.

Mike Seay’s 17-year-old daughter Ashley was one of two teens killed in April when their SUV veered off the road and slammed into a tree in Antioch, NBC 5 Chicago reported.

He said he received a letter on Thursday addressed to “Mike Seay, Daughter Killed in Car Crash, or Current Business.”

“Why would they have that type of information?” he said. “Why would they need that? What purpose does it serve anybody to know that? And how much other types of other information do they have if they have that on me, or anyone else? And how do they use that, what do they use that for?”

OfficeMax told NBC 5 that a third-party mailing list provider was to blame for the oversight.

“We are deeply sorry that Mr. Seay and his family received this mailing from us, and we are reaching out to Mr. Seay to convey our sincerest apologies on this unfortunate matter,” OfficeMax said in a statement. “This mailing is a result of a mailing list rented through a third-party provider. We have reached out to the third-party mailing list provider to research what happened. Based on a preliminary investigation today we believe this to be an inadvertent error; and we are continuing the investigation.”
