The United States would likely not exist, and Europe certainly would have a different loo, if it were not for their bedrock foundation in the Christian faith. Most Christians—really, most Americans—believe the United States and the West have been too apologetic about that subject for too long.

So does this perhaps unlikely Republican presidential hopeful.

"I think it's very important that Europe and Western civilization begin to stand up for its fundamental values. They're primarily Jewish and Christian values," Ohio Gov. John Kasich said on Fox News Sunday this week.

Kasich has been outspoken about his religious beliefs at times—but often citing the Bible in ways that confuse the hearers—such as saying the top biblical issue facing America is early childhood education, or his belief that Matthew 25 was his basis for state Medicaid expansion under ObamaCare.

His latest remarks came as he said the United States should accept Muslim refugees from Syria, saying perhaps we will influence them to accept Western religious or cultural beliefs.

Upholding Western values, he said, is important "so that when these folks come, that we can have assimilation, so they don't change us, but maybe in some ways we either change them or live peacefully—of course, peacefully—with them, and we have a full integration."

What do you think of the prospects of Muslim refugees one day accepting Judeo-Christian values?
