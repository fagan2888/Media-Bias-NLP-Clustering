Menlo Park residents gathered Friday in Fremont Park for the town’s tree-lighting ceremony.

Even Santa paid a visit and read the children “The Night Before Christmas.” The park’s tree this year featured a 50,400-light display.

“I’m just so excited that everyone could come up and celebrate with us today. It’s so exciting,” said Menlo Park Mayor Catherine Carlton. The mayor lit up the tree while children and parents counted down.

This is the second year the town has hosted a tree-lighting ceremony.
