On Monday, comedian Wayne Brady opened up about his struggle with depression in an interview with Entertainment Tonight. Brady is taking the bold step of tearing down the stigma that surrounds mental health issues like depression.

“Nobody wants to out themselves, so to speak, or if they out themselves, it’s in a very — I hate to say it — Hollywood way,” Brady told ET.

“But if someone says, ‘I’m clinically depressed,’ that sounds like someone’s making something up,” he continued. “It’s like, ‘Psst, you’re not depressed.'”

Brady, known for his hilarious improvisation on “Whose Line Is It Anyway?” also discussed the effect Robin Williams’ suicide had on his own battle with depression. Following the news of Williams’ death Brady tweeted:

Depression is real. God Bless Him and his family. — Wayne Brady (@waynebrady) August 12, 2014

He told ET:

“When he was on stage [in] full-on Robin mode — and I know this from being blessed enough to work with him — you could not touch that man,” he tells ET. “He made all these people feel great. And at the same time, knowing that he had this sense of … what I make up in my mind, this low sense of self-worth, of belonging, of loneliness, of pain that all the money in the world can’t cure, all the accolades and awards, and all the love from people all over the world … all that love could still not stop that man from saying, I am in so much pain.'”
