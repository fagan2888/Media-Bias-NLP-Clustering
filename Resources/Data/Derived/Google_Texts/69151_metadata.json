Besides a nasty mixture, you also get an old Anglo-Saxon remedy for a stye, an infection of the eyelash follicles. Researchers from the University of Nottingham in the UK have now revived this thousand-year-old remedy, and found it\u2019s surprisingly good at eliminating the bacteria responsible for styes; one that\u2019s become increasingly resistant to current antibiotics.\n\nThe 1,000-year-old Medieval recipe was found in Bald\u2019s Leechbook, an old leatherbound book that\u2019s considered one of the oldest medical textbooks in existence. Curious to see how effective the \u201cpotion\u201d was against the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, they recreated it. But while they found it was effective in treating styes, they also found, perhaps more importantly, that it could kill methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) in artificial wounds. The drug-resistant superbug causes over 80,000 severe infections and 11,000 deaths each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), with most emerging in health care settings.\n\n\u201cWe thought that Bald\u2019s eyesalve might show a small amount of antibiotic activity because each of the ingredients has been shown by other researchers to have some effect on bacteria in the lab,\u201d said study leader Freya Harrison, a microbiologist at the university, according to CBS. \u201cCopper and bile salts can kill bacteria, and the garlic family of plants make chemicals that interfere with the bacteria\u2019s ability to damage infected tissue.\u201d\n\nThe team recreated four batches of the salve, which becomes creamy after nine days, using fresh ingredients. They then applied it to the artificial wounds in both full-strength and diluted form \u2014 as well as treating each wound with individual ingredients. They found that only the full-strength form of the salve worked, and when it did, it killed all but one out of 1,000 cells of MRSA. It was even powerful enough to break down MRSA biofilms, naturally drug-resistant cellular communities.\n\nAntibiotic-resistant bacteria are a growing concern not only in the U.S. but throughout the world. As more people unnecessarily use antibiotics, their numbers will grow, and previously eradicated disease could reemerge. Over two million people in the U.S. alone become infected with one of these superbugs each year, and 23,000 die from them. For this reason, the Obama administration recently released an internationally focused action plan to prevent their growth last week.\n\n\"The rise of antibiotic resistance in pathogenic bacteria and the lack of new antimicrobials in the developmental pipeline are key challenges for human health,\" Harrison said. \"There is a pressing need to develop new strategies against pathogens because the cost of developing new antibiotics is high and eventual resistance is likely.\"", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "old, english, remedy, successfully, kills, antibiotic, resistant, staph, bacteria", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A thousand-year-old remedy for eye infections may also fight modern-day drug-resistant bacteria, a new study finds.", "title": "A Nasty Medieval Remedy May Soon Be Used To Fight Infections", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/old-english-remedy-successfully-kills-antibiotic-resistant-staph-bacteria-328152", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/04/mrsa.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A thousand-year-old remedy for eye infections may also fight modern-day drug-resistant bacteria, a new study finds.", "title": "A Nasty Medieval Remedy May Soon Be Used To Fight Infections", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/old-english-remedy-successfully-kills-antibiotic-resistant-staph-bacteria-328152", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/04/mrsa.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/04/mrsa.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Weird Medicine", "published_time": "2015-04-04T15:47:32-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-04T15:48:43-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A thousand-year-old remedy for eye infections may also fight modern-day drug-resistant bacteria, a new study finds."}, "article_summary": "Besides a nasty mixture, you also get an old Anglo-Saxon remedy for a stye, an infection of the eyelash follicles.\nBut while they found it was effective in treating styes, they also found, perhaps more importantly, that it could kill methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) in artificial wounds.\nAntibiotic-resistant bacteria are a growing concern not only in the U.S. but throughout the world.\nThe 1,000-year-old Medieval recipe was found in Bald\u2019s Leechbook, an old leatherbound book that\u2019s considered one of the oldest medical textbooks in existence.\n\"The rise of antibiotic resistance in pathogenic bacteria and the lack of new antimicrobials in the developmental pipeline are key challenges for human health,\" Harrison said."}
