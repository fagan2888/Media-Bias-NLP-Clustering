Q: What makes fresh fruits and vegetables shrivel, rot or go limp?

A: Much of the time, the culprit is the way you’re storing them. Remember:

■ Fruits and vegetables don’t play well together. So don’t store them together in a refrigerator drawer or next to each other on the counter or in a pantry. Many fruits produce ethylene gas, which acts like a ripening hormone and can speed spoilage.

■ Vegetables need to breathe. Poke holes in the plastic bags you store them in, or keep them in mesh bags. An airtight plastic bag is the worst choice. And don’t pack veggies tightly together; they need space for air circulation or they’ll spoil faster.

■ Don’t clean produce until you’re ready to use it. Dampness encourages bacteria growth.

■ Store garlic at room temperature in an open container, to allow air circulation.

Don’t take off the protective papery husk until you’re ready to prep. It’s fine to store garlic next to its buddy, the onion.

■ Keep potatoes in a dark and cool place, but don’t refrigerate. The cold, damp air in the refrigerator causes their starches to turn into sugars, which can affect taste and texture. Store them in a paper bag — more breathable than plastic — in a coolish spot, such as a pantry. Keep them away from onions or fruits like apples that exude ethylene gas, which can make your spuds begin to sprout.

■ Cucumbers hate to be cold. Anything below 50 degrees will cause them to spoil faster. If you must refrigerate them, do it for no more than three days. Cucumbers also are sensitive to ethylene gas, so keep them away from bananas, melons and tomatoes.

■ Break up the bunch of bananas, as charming as it might look. Then wrap each stem in plastic wrap. That will reduce the emission of ethylene gas, and the bananas will ripen more slowly. Once a banana reaches the desired ripeness, refrigerate it to keep it from ripening further.
