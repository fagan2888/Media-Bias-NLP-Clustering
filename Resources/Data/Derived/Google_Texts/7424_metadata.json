The design is a \"blooming nine patch.\" (The nine-patchy nature of the quilt might not be obvious at a distance. Click here for a close-up. If you look carefully, you'll see that every other square is 3x3 nine-patch.) It's machine pieced and machine quilted, and it's the only quilt Marian has designed specifically to coordinate with our house. (It matches the drapes.) And since this is our final quilt, it's fitting to spotlight the person responsible for this year's quiltfest. In this year's final catblogging picture, Marian is doing her best to get Domino to cooperate with the camera, and as you can see, she succeeded admirably.\n\nAnd now for one more year-end pitch. The most important part of Mother Jones isn't this blog, it's the serious investigative reporting we do. As the PEN Award judges put it, we've become an \"internationally recognized powerhouse...influencing everything from the gun-control debate to presidential campaigns.\"\n\nBut it takes money to do this, so we're holding a fundraiser right now for our investigative reporting fund. If you value our independent voice, please contribute a few dollars. We'll make sure your gift will immediately go to support Mother Jones' reporting.
