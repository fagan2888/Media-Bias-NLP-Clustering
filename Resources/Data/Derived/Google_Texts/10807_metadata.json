We did not.\"\n\nAs Hallsville continues to grow, city leaders said they believe having medical professionals take over the clinic will raise the quality of care but also make it more convenient for patients who won't have to drive to Columbia for serious care.\n\n\"It's convenient for my family, my friends, my neighbors and just for everybody, whether it be the elderly, down to little children,\" said Hallsville Mayor Cheri Reisch. \"Just to have a doctor right there if you get hurt or you have an illness is going to be so nice.\"\n\nSchloot said the clinic will be closed for a few weeks as they prepare to get Boone Hospitals to sign the lease.\n\nHe said Boone agreed to take care of the patients in the meantime.", "article_metadata": {"ib-analytics": "data", "description": "The current chairman of Hallsville Area Family Clinic said Friday he is in the final stages of discussions with Boone Hospitals to transfer ownership of the clinic to them.", "generator": "ibPublish 2", "author": "KMIZ", "og": {"site_name": "KMIZ", "description": "The current chairman of Hallsville Area Family Clinic said Friday he is in the final stages of discussions with Boone Hospitals to transfer ownership of the clinic to them.", "title": "Hallsville's sole medical clinic could change ownership", "url": "http://www.abc17news.com/news/hallsvilles-sole-medical-clinic-could-change-ownership/39051964", "image": "http://www.abc17news.com/image/view/-/39052234/highRes/1/-/maxh/640/maxw/640/-/h9r7g8/-/Capture-JPG.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.abc17news.com/news/hallsvilles-sole-medical-clinic-could-change-ownership/39051964", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1609581899287500}, "keywords": "hallsville, new clinic, hallsville clinic, boone hospitals, clinic bought by boone", "google-site-verification": "kUZ30QUmBtGKAbKRfp2D5_HRb0MSloDYl5BbZhG9Fvg", "news_keywords": "hallsville, new clinic, hallsville clinic, boone hospitals, clinic bought by boone"}, "article_summary": "-The current chairman of Hallsville Area Family Clinic said Friday he is in the final stages of discussions with Boone Hospitals to transfer ownership of the clinic to them.\nNeither have medical experience and Schloot said this has hurt them as they try to run the clinic.\nSchloot said the clinic will be closed for a few weeks as they prepare to get Boone Hospitals to sign the lease.\nHe said it was a relief to have Boone Hospitals put an offer on the table.\nCurrently, the clinic is run by John and Rose Schloot as a non-profit with financial help from the Central Bank of Boone County."}
