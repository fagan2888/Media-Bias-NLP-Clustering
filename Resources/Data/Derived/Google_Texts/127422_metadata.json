Garrett Love said he will introduce the nation\u2019s first such legislation, the Unborn Child Protection From Dismemberment Abortion Act, by the end of January. He and other pro-life activists held a news conference last week to trumpet the strategy and its rollout in Kansas.\n\nThis is a \u201cvery gruesome type of abortion,\u201d in which abortionists use a scissorlike tool to \u201crip the arms and legs\u201d off an unborn child\u2019s body and let it bleed to death, Mr. Love, a Republican, told The Washington Times.\n\n\u201cThere are many people who want to see this stopped, and that\u2019s why I am bringing this bill,\u201d said Mr. Love.\n\nHe said an estimated 578, or 8 percent of Kansas abortions, are performed in this manner every year.\n\nA pro-choice official said allies will oppose the bill, which The Wichita Eagle reported would prohibit the use of forceps, clamps, tongs, scissors and similar instruments to abort a living fetus.\n\n\u201cPlanned Parenthood will expose this legislation for what it is: an intrusive, insulting measure that does nothing to improve the quality of women\u2019s lives or health care,\u201d said Laura McQuade, president and chief executive of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Kansas and Mid-Missouri.\n\nKansas women \u201cdon\u2019t need more legislation intended to judge, coerce and restrict their decisions,\u201d she said.\n\nAccording to medical websites, a common form of abortion during the 12th to 22nd week of pregnancy is called dilation and evacuation, or D&E. Partial-birth abortion was known almost exclusively as intact dilation and extraction, or D&X, in medical journals before the 1990s.\n\nThe procedure requires a pregnant woman to receive drugs to dilate her cervix for about 36 hours. The abortionist then may use vacuum aspiration, tongs, clamps and specially designed instruments, such as serrated-jaw forceps, to firmly grasp and remove the contents of the uterus.\n\nSome 51,000 abortions were performed to end pregnancies at 13 weeks or later using curettage, which includes D&E, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in its most recent Abortion Surveillance report.\n\nThis is equivalent to about 9 percent of the 730,322 abortions reported in 2011 to the agency \u2014 which doesn\u2019t include data from California, Maryland or New Hampshire, the CDC said.\n\nKansans for Life noted that the Guttmacher Institute, which surveys abortion providers in all states, estimates that more than 1 million abortions were performed in 2011.\n\nIf almost 9 percent of abortions were performed after the first trimester, it means that close to 100,000 unborn children could have been subjected to dismemberment abortion, said Kansans for Life.\n\nNational Right to Life officials said its model legislation could \u201ctransform the landscape of abortion policy\u201d because it should pass muster at the Supreme Court.\n\nThe high court has held that \u201cprotecting unborn children from the brutal inhumanity of partial-birth abortion did not impose an unconstitutional \u2018undue burden\u2019 on abortion because other methods could be used,\u201d Mary Spaulding Balch, director of the state legislation department of National Right to Life, said in a memo.\n\nMoreover, since the Supreme Court upheld a ban on abortions of \u201cpartially born,\u201d intact fetuses, it is \u201chighly likely\u201d to uphold laws against abortions in which a sharp instrument is used to slice up a living unborn child, she wrote.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re hoping to shock the nation\u201d that dismemberment abortion is still going on, National Right to Life attorney Jennifer Popik told The Washington Times.\n\n\u201cI would say it\u2019s a game changer,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause this really focuses on the humanity of the unborn child.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Legislation banning the \"dismemberment\" of a fetus is being pitched as a game changer because it could outlaw an entire type of abortion procedure, pro-life activists said.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Legislation banning the \u201cdismemberment\u201d of a fetus is being pitched as a game changer because it could outlaw an entire type of abortion procedure, pro-life activists said.", "title": "Abortion game changer: Fetus \u2018dismemberment\u2019 ban touted by pro-life activists", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/18/abortion-game-changer-fetus-dismemberment-ban-tout/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/18/abortion.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/18/abortion.jpg", "description": "Legislation banning the \"dismemberment\" of a fetus is being pitched as a game changer because it could outlaw an entire type of abortion procedure, pro-life activists said.", "card": "summary", "title": "Abortion game changer: Fetus \u2018dismemberment\u2019 ban touted by"}, "Author": "Cheryl Wetzstein", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Social Issues, Garrett Love"}, "article_summary": "Legislation banning the \u201cdismemberment\u201d of a fetus is being pitched as a game changer because it could outlaw an entire type of abortion procedure, pro-life activists said.\nPartial-birth abortion was known almost exclusively as intact dilation and extraction, or D&X, in medical journals before the 1990s.\n\u201cWe\u2019re hoping to shock the nation\u201d that dismemberment abortion is still going on, National Right to Life attorney Jennifer Popik told The Washington Times.\n\u201cDismemberment\u201d abortions refer to procedures in which doctors use surgical instruments, such as sharp-toothed forceps, to twist and tear away the limbs of a living fetus to cause its death.\n\u201cI would say it\u2019s a game changer,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause this really focuses on the humanity of the unborn child.\u201d"}
