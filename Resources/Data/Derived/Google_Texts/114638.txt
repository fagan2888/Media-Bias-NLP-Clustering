There's no question that voluntary benefits are in high demand by employers and their employees alike. For example, an EyeMed survey of 552 business leaders revealed that 71.3 percent said their employees were interested in customizing benefits to meet their needs. A recent Gallup poll found that 82 percent of survey respondents (American workers) placed a higher premium on voluntary benefits following the last recession.

Employers, who recognize the value in voluntary benefits for retaining a loyal and motivated workforce, are increasingly looking to add more voluntary benefits to their companiesâ€™ offerings.
