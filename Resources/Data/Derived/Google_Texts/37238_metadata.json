See @ATLblog, @DavidLat, @ElieNYC, @StaciZaretsky, and @JosephPatrice.\n\nNow, on to the game\u2026.\n\nLast year, we played a blackout-inducing drinking game. It was a huge success. Little known fact: University of Miami Law grad Senator Marco Rubio was even playing along last year.\n\nThis time around let\u2019s keep the drinking, but change the game a bit. Who\u2019s up for some Bingo?\n\nFor the drinking, drink at your leisure, but be prepared to finish your drink whenever someone in your game gets a Bingo. If you want to play with the rest of the ATL readership, you can do that too! How will you know when someone wins? Well, Tweet \u201cBingo!\u201d to @ATLBlog and we\u2019ll retweet it around. The good people at Osric have a Bingo card generator, so you just cut and paste the word list at the bottom of this post into the appropriate field and BANG, you\u2019ve got yourself a Bingo card!\n\nChange in Subject \u2014 The easy one. The State of the Union is expected to address \u2014 at the very least \u2014 immigration, the minimum wage, health care, Iran, and North Korea. When a new subject arises, check this box. Simple.\n\nCut to SCOTUS \u2014 At least some contingent of the Court will be in the room, and whenever a robe is on screen, mark your card. There\u2019s are potential double points available here because\u2026\n\nCut to Ginsburg Asleep \u2014 I didn\u2019t expect her to fall asleep again last year. But\u2026 she did.\n\nCut to Attorney General Eric Holder \u2014 The nation\u2019s top lawyer will get on screen at some point. The odds that he ends up sitting this one out (as one cabinet member must) are virtually nil because the Attorney General is too high profile. Sitting out is for the Secretary of Agriculture\u2026\n\nExecutive Order \u2014 The theme of 2014 is supposedly the \u201cYear of Action,\u201d so expect the President to throw around the prospect of making law unilaterally a bunch. His decision to boost the minimum wage for federal contractors via executive order is already out there.\n\nThe Constitution \u2014 The most legal of all possible references. If the President mentions the Constitution in any explicit way, including \u201cconstitutional\u201d or a specific mention of any Amendment, you can mark it.\n\n\u201cLaw\u201d \u2014 For that matter, whenever he says, \u201cLaw.\u201d\n\n\u201cState of [the/our] Union\u201d \u2014 Last year I compared this to the annoying moment when a character in a movie bends over backward to name check the movie:\n\nI hope it will not come up tonight, but it will.\n\nStanding Ovation \u2014 Last year there were 41 standing ovations. If you get this on your card, stand up and cheer.\n\nObamacare/Health Care \u2014 The troubled rollout was a favorite talking point for months, but with enrollment almost meeting the administration\u2019s goals to this point, the President will doubtless bring it up to shift the narrative on it.\n\nGun Control \u2014 Last year, the Sandy Hook shooting didn\u2019t just put gun control on the agenda, it made it the only thing the whole nation agreed upon, with upwards of 90 percent supporting background checks and majorities supporting assault weapons bans and clip capacity limits. And\u2026 nothing happened.\n\nCitizens United \u2014 And the reason nothing happened on gun control is the outsized influence of gun manufacturer money in Washington. Will President Obama raise the Supreme Court case that gave rise to one of the most famous moments in his State of the Union history?\n\nNSA \u2014 Obama has announced some changes to the NSA. Those changes don\u2019t include the whole \u201cno longer spying on you\u201d provision, but it\u2019s a start.\n\nEdward Snowden \u2014 If he gets a specific namecheck. If Obama announces a pardon, just quit the game and concentrate on the social media fallout.\n\nGay Marriage \u2014 States are joining the marriage equality fold right and left. Literally, with Utah and Oklahoma on board. But Oklahoma is eyeing a new escape route from the 21st Century: banning all marriage. Derp.\n\nElection Law \u2014 President Obama has spoken to the issue of voter suppression before. Now that he\u2019s chosen Stanford Law\u2019s Pam Karlan to serve as Assistant Attorney General for Voting Rights, he\u2019s signaled that this remains an administration priority.\n\nJudicial Nominations \u2014 We live in a post-nuclear world so the backlog of nominations is a less pressing political issue than it was last year, but it could still get a shoutout.\n\nImmigration Reform \u2014 It seems like a year ago when everyone talked about comprehensive immigration reform as the bipartisan issue whose passage was just around the corner. That\u2019s because it was a year ago.\n\nFarm Bill \u2014 You may not think the Farm Bill is a big deal, but it\u2019s a really big deal. It looks like the only substantive legislation Congress will pass this year, too. Come to think of it, this is why the Secretary Vilsack probably won\u2019t sit out tonight.\n\nCut to a Special Guest \u2014 There\u2019s more than a dozen guests sitting with First Lady Michelle Obama. Elsewhere in the gallery, we\u2019ll have Sean Hannity, the Mayor of Fort Lee, and some Duck Dynasty guy. We\u2019re just missing a Kardashian to round out the sideshow.\n\nGeneric Words \u2014 Speech-giving clich\u00e9 time! Let\u2019s go with: Hope, Progress, Gridlock, Change, Forward, Republican, Democrat, My Friend, The American People, Equal, Historic, War on [Insert], Help, Economy, Jobs.\n\nSo now that we\u2019ve got our words, go to Osric and change the title of the card to \u201cATL SOTU Game,\u201d change the Free Space text to \u201cFree\u201d or maybe \u201cObama On Screen,\u201d and then cut and paste the below list into the Word List:\n\nChange in Subject, Cut to SCOTUS, Cut to Ginsburg Asleep, Cut to Attorney General Eric Holder, Executive Order, The Constitution, Law, State of The Union, Standing Ovation, Obamacare or Health Care, Gun Control, Citizens United, NSA, Edward Snowden, Gay Marriage, Election Law, Judicial Nominations, Immigration Reform, Farm Bill, Cut to a Special Guest, Hope, Progress, Gridlock, Change, Forward, Republican, Democrat, My Friend, The American People, Equal, Historic, War on Insert Something Here, Help, Economy, Jobs\n\nHere\u2019s my card:\n\nGood luck!\n\nBingo Card Generator [Osric]\n\nLet Us Sit Upon The Ground and Tell Sad Tales About The State Of The Union [ATL Redline]\n\nEarlier: A Lawyer\u2019s Guide to Getting Drunk During the State of the Union", "article_metadata": {"description": "This year, let's play some Bingo during the President's speech.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "Author": "Joe Patrice", "og": {"site_name": "Above the Law", "description": "This year, let's play some Bingo during the President's speech.", "title": "BINGO!
