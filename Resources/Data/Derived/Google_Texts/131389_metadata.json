They are expired Maryland firearms dealer licenses and are useless in Waldorf, but Mr. Greer has plans for them in Pennsylvania.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll use these for target practice,\u201d he said.\n\nLeaving the town he has called home for 24 years wasn\u2019t always in the cards for the 55-year-old businessman, but it became a reality this year when he saw the direction state lawmakers wanted to take on gun control.\n\nThe Firearm Safety Act of 2013, passed by the Democrat-controlled General Assembly in April, is one of the most sweeping gun control packages in the country. The legislative package adds 45 guns to a list of banned assault weapons, limits handgun magazines to 10 rounds, and requires gun buyers to submit their fingerprints and obtain handgun qualification licenses.\n\nThe laws take effect Oct. 1, which is also the cutoff date for grandfathering firearms applications and purchases.\n\nMr. Greer trails off when he considers the impact of the laws and the resulting rush for gun purchases caused by the new rules.\n\n\u201cNot every store is in the same situation I am, but for a small-business guy like me. Once the bill went through the House and Senate and looked like it was actually going to pass, I saw that it was going to be impossible to make a living.\u201d\n\nFor the past four years, Angus MacGregor\u2019s Trading Post has kept a steady business selling firearms, accessories and ammunition from a two-story reconverted home in Waldorf. Until Saturday, the last day to buy guns from Mr. Greer\u2019s Maryland store, the store\u2019s gun room displayed an array of rifles and handguns.\n\nOn the opposite side of the house is a much smaller collection of model-train supplies, remnants of Mr. Greer\u2019s original idea for a hobby store which opened 11 years ago.\n\n\u201cI did surprisingly well,\u201d he said, adding that the tanking economy also brought bad times to the hobby market.\n\nForced to look for another source of income, Mr. Greer drew from a childhood interest. While growing up in Ithaca, N.Y., he collected guns from the Ithaca Gun Co. and knew there was room for another dealer in the Waldorf firearms market.\n\n\u201cI thought if I got my federal firearms license, it might help the business,\u201d Mr. Greer said. \u201cIt worked. People were so happy to have another choice in town to buy guns. It was a welcome addition to the town.\u201d\n\nGov. Martin O\u2019Malley, a Democrat, proposed the firearms act in January after the mass shooting a month earlier at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t even believe they were even thinking about doing stuff like this,\u201d Mr. Greer said. \u201cThe gun laws in Maryland are already extremely restrictive.\u201d\n\nCurrent law requires a purchase application, which is forwarded to the licensing division of the Maryland State Police. Officers check a series of 16 databases to make sure the prospective buyer is not prohibited from owning a gun. Once that process is complete, the application is verified, the gun dealer is notified and the buyer may pick up the gun.\n\nThe state police have a seven-day window to perform the background check and deny the application if necessary. The dealer then can release the gun, though doing so \u201cis much more complicated,\u201d Mr. Greer said. \u201cI don\u2019t want guns going into the hands of the wrong people. We are the final checkpoint before sending guns out in the public.\u201d\n\nSince the Oct. 1 deadline was set, Maryland State Police have been overwhelmed by what officials said are unprecedented numbers of firearm purchase applications.\n\nAs of Sept. 6, the licensing division received 88,884 applications and processed 48,934 of them, police said. Up to 200 state employees were recruited this month to help enter confidential information into computers to help speed up the process. That move has touched off a wave of criticism from firearms advocates claiming privacy violations, and at least one formal complaint by a Maryland delegate to the state\u2019s attorney general.\n\nState police said it plans to start conducting background checks Monday with the help of 20 additional police officers from the Maryland Transportation Authority, the Maryland Department of Natural Resources, the Maryland Transit Administration, and Maryland Capital Police. By law, background checks must be conducted by police officers under the supervision of the state police.\n\nMr. Greer\u2019s office has been receiving state police checks on applications from as far back as May, and that is without the laws requiring fingerprinting and a handgun license.\n\nAs of Oct. 1, anyone looking to buy a gun must get a handgun qualifying license, which includes four hours of handgun training taught by a certified instructor and time spent firing at a range.\n\nJust what that course entails, or what is on the application for a license, is anyone\u2019s guess, Mr. Greer said.\n\n\u201cNo one really knows what\u2019s on the application,\u201d Mr. Greer said. \u201cThere\u2019s not enough ranges to handle this.\u201d\n\nState police said an application process that complies with the laws has been developed by the state police information technology department and is scheduled to be implemented Oct. 1.\n\nPolice will have a 30-day window to process the application, Mr. Greer said, \u201cso at best you can\u2019t purchase or pick up your gun for a minimum of 30 days.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re already behind on applications because of the buying frenzy,\u201d Mr. Greer said, suggesting that the most realistic scenario could be 60 or 90 days before an application is approved.\n\n\u201cNinety percent of my store\u2019s sales are handguns,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t survive for a month. A business needs its cash flow.\u201d\n\nFor the rest of this month, Mr. Greer will spend half of the week in Waldorf packing up the office, and the other half settling into his home and office, which is minutes from the Seven Springs ski resort and about an hour southeast of Pittsburgh.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m getting a little piece of heaven,\u201d he said. \u201cI get to keep my business. I can start selling guns tomorrow out of there. It\u2019s a very gun-friendly state \u2014 for now.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jim Greer stood beside his desk in the small back office of Angus MacGregor's Trading Post in Waldorf, Md., and rifled through several papers at the top of a file box.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Jim Greer stood beside his desk in the small back office of Angus MacGregor\u2019s Trading Post in Waldorf, Md., and rifled through several papers at the top of a file box.", "title": "Maryland\u2019s restrictive gun laws drive dealer to Pennsylvania to make a living", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/sep/15/marylands-restrictive-gun-laws-drive-dealer-to-pen/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/09/15/9_152013_guns-20130912-014-08201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/09/15/9_152013_guns-20130912-014-08201.jpg", "description": "Jim Greer stood beside his desk in the small back office of Angus MacGregor's Trading Post in Waldorf, Md., and rifled through several papers at the top of a file box.", "card": "summary", "title": "Maryland\u2019s restrictive gun laws drive dealer to Pennsylvania to"}, "Author": "Meredith Somers", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "War Conflict, Jim Greer, Angus Macgregor"}, "article_summary": "They are expired Maryland firearms dealer licenses and are useless in Waldorf, but Mr. Greer has plans for them in Pennsylvania.\nWearing khaki camouflage pants and a green shirt that offsets his salt-and-pepper goatee, Mr. Greer held up three thick papers.\nThe dealer then can release the gun, though doing so \u201cis much more complicated,\u201d Mr. Greer said.\n\u201cThe gun laws in Maryland are already extremely restrictive.\u201dCurrent law requires a purchase application, which is forwarded to the licensing division of the Maryland State Police.\n\u201cNo one really knows what\u2019s on the application,\u201d Mr. Greer said."}
