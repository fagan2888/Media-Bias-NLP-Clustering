It will be every day walking in that Oval Office, asking the chief of staff if we\u2019re getting the VA straightened up, if we\u2019re getting the work done for these veterans\u2014men and women who held their hand up and who said, \u2018Here I am, send me.\u2019\u201d\n\nPerry said that \u201cwe made them a promise\u201d and \u201cwe\u2019ll live up to it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen the cost of war on the faces of these young men and women and their families,\u201d Perry said. \u201cWe understand something, and that is, that we need to do everything we can in our power to never put these young men and women in harm\u2019s way.
