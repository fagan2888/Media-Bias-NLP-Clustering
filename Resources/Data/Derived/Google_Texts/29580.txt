The Right Side Forum, an hour-long conservative live news and talk show hosted by columnist Armstrong Williams, this week will look at the challenge of Alzheimer’s disease for the nation as well as the patients and families who must deal with it. His guests this week are George Vradenburg, co-founder, USAgainstAlzheimer’s; Trish Vradenburg, co-Founder, USAgainstAlzheimer’s and Meryl Comer, CEO, Geoffrey Beene Foundation Alzheimer’s Initiative.

Armstrong points out recent statistics that indicate as many as one in nine Americans over the age of 65 has Alzheimer’s disease. And the number of those living with the progressive brain disease is expected to rise by 40 percent in the next decade. That means that Alzheimer’s will touch every one of us in some way, he says, adding that the conversation will suggest ways to fight back against the march of Alzheimer’s disease across the nation.

“Have you ever watched Alzheimer’s take a loved one away from you? It’s a cruel disease. It costs so much, emotionally and financially, and there is still so little that can be done about it. Progress is being made, but we need to do much more. And fast! That’s why you’ve got to meet my guests this week, who have turned the heartbreak Alzheimer’s gave them into the power to help so many others,” Armstrong notes.

The show, which debuted in January, airs live on Saturday mornings at 10:30 a.m. on News Channel 8 in the Washington, D.C., area, and repeats again at 6:30 p.m.
