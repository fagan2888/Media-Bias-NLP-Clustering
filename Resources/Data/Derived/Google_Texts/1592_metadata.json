But even in this nation of immigrants I\u2019ve come to see that I\u2019ll always feel like a foreigner. I feel especially foreign during presidential election campaigns. Unfortunately, that means all the time.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to say when Hillary Clinton actually started her run for president -- sometime in the 1990s -- but she announced the official start of her latest effort a week ago, before taking to a van in search of everyday Americans to champion. Her declaration had been keenly awaited, and the delay had started to arouse concern. After all, she now has barely 19 months left to make her case.\n\nIsn\u2019t this a little excessive? The time, effort and money that will be poured into the battle for the presidency are enormous -- and, let\u2019s be honest, the difference the outcome will make is limited. In my native Britain, the ratio is inverted. Elections matter more, and they\u2019re over in a flash. In the U.S., the disjuncture between input and output is extreme, yet it seems to trouble few Americans.\n\nI\u2019m not saying the election doesn\u2019t matter at all. It matters, especially when it comes to foreign policy. But even foreign policy is driven more by unforeseen events and immovable facts than by any president\u2019s ideas. It\u2019s a test of temperament as much as ideology, and that\u2019s hard to judge before the fact. In domestic policy, the president\u2019s power is explicitly circumscribed: Congress writes the laws. Budget constraints, partisan bickering and the mysterious arts of redistricting do the rest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDoesn\u2019t the Affordable Care Act -- nicknamed Obamacare, not Pelosicare -- refute such defeatism? Only up to a point. It happened in a rare moment of unified control of the White House and Capitol Hill. Obama delegated design of the plan to Congress and, far from pushing it anywhere, failed to make the case to the public; because of that, the law\u2019s future is still in doubt. And by the way, only by American standards can Obamacare be judged a truly radical reform, rather than a muddled compromise. Is this the best that presidential power can do?\n\nSure, it matters who\u2019s president, but the endless attention paid to choosing the candidate still seems out of proportion. What\u2019s more, the effort is self-negating: In its own right, it diminishes what\u2019s at stake. Campaigning drains energy and attention from governing: It\u2019s a substitute for the real thing.\n\nWhile Clinton was meeting everyday Iowans this week, the sitting president was talking to an audience in North Carolina about \u201cmiddle-class economics.\u201d By middle class, he means everyday Americans. This is supposed to be the domestic-policy theme for the time remaining in his presidency, which is ample. And a good theme it is too. Yet all of a sudden Obama, who\u2019s in office, seems less important than Clinton, who isn\u2019t. In pressing his goals he is now competing for the spotlight with a candidate who, if successful, won\u2019t take over until 2017 -- to say nothing of the many Republican contenders for his job. As the Wall Street Journal put it: \u201cThis moment, when the political conversation begins to turn from the current White House to the next one, arrives during every administration. But Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign, which went from zero to full-fledged frenzy this week, may have hastened the process.\u201d\n\nMy inner Brit wants to say that the political conversation is therefore about the wrong thing. At the same time, as Americans insist, it is what it is.\n\nEveryday Americans, I believe, understand the issue and have adapted with characteristic resourcefulness. They see national politics as part of the sports and entertainment industry: fun to watch, if your tastes run that way; capable of arousing obsessive interest among true devotees and the mentally disturbed; but not amounting to much and certainly not as important as, say, electing your local mayor or sheriff. The media, attentive to the appetites of everyday Americans, report national politics in just this way.\n\nThe proof is that presidential candidates, like other celebrities, need lots of things to talk about, including views about policies of all kinds -- but require no actual policies. Who cares what they would do if they were leaders in a parliamentary system, capable of breaking or keeping their promises? It\u2019s beside the point. A British minister, on resigning, once told Parliament that the government he was leaving gave the impression of being \u201cin office, but not in power.\u201d A devastating assessment in Britain reads like a mere statement of the obvious in the U.S.\n\nFor the same reason, it\u2019s merely desirable -- not essential -- that presidential candidates be trustworthy. The winner is going to be hemmed in by Congress, and for much of the time, once elected, will be irrelevant, as Obama has discovered. If the winner isn\u2019t going to be entrusted with power, why would it matter that he or she is trustworthy?\n\nFor the purpose of winning -- and what other purpose is there? -- it\u2019s far more important that a presidential candidate be liked. Voters liked Obama, and probably agreed with him when he said in 2008 that Clinton was only \u201clikeable enough.\u201d That\u2019s doubtless in her playbook for 2016, and she has plenty of time to advance the ball -- if that\u2019s the correct expression. Not that it matters all that much whether she does.\n\nClive Crook is a Bloomberg View columnist and a member of the Bloomberg View editorial board.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Columns, Columns news, Pontiac Columns news, MI Columns news, US Columns news, world Columns news.", "title": "The US and the art of empty electioneering", "og": {"url": "http://www.theoaklandpress.com/article/OP/20150420/NEWS/150429981", "image": {"width": "1500px", "identifier": "http://www.theoaklandpress.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/OP/20150420/NEWS/150429981/AR/0/AR-150429981.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "1035px"}, "type": "article", "title": "The US and the art of empty electioneering"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theoaklandpress.com", "description": "I\u2019ve lived in the United States for 10 years now -- and would like to stay if it will have me.
