Their scores on previous standardized tests rank them from the highest- to lowest-performing schools in the state.\n\nFor instance, in Peoria County, signers included Grenita Lathan of Peoria School District 150, the area\u2019s largest district; Lisa Parker of Dunlap Community Unit District 323; and Shannon Dudek of Pleasant Hill District 69, one of the area\u2019s smallest districts.\n\nBut they all hit the same note in their concerns about the launch of PARCC, or Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Career.\n\nTechnological problems on practice tests, even among schools with adequate infrastructure and bandwidth, have been so significant that one superintendent predicts the rollout will repeat the trouble-plagued launch of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s health care marketplace in 2013.\n\n\u201cKids are going to find out once they submit their final answers a screen is going to pop up telling them they\u2019ve just signed up for a $500 deductible health care plan,\u201d said Tim Dotson, superintendent of Limestone Walters School District 316.\n\nSuperintendents blame the testmaker, NCS Pearson Education Inc., for many of the interface and software problems they\u2019re already seeing during practice sessions. According to published reports, Pearson has a four-year contract, worth up to $160 million, with Illinois.\n\nThe test will be given to students in third-to-eighth grades and some high school students.\n\nLike Common Core, the PARCC exam is meant to develop critical thinking skills. Instead of the old fill-in the bubble multiple choice questions, the test includes written essays and multi-media components.\n\nEven without technology problems, superintendents say schools have not had enough time to prepare students to use the tools of a new computerized test; many schools don\u2019t have adequate infrastructure; and most importantly, schools have lost valuable instructional time while trying to prepare for the test that doesn\u2019t work.\n\n\u201cOur fear is that this is just a small indication of what is to come when the March testing window opens for all school districts in the state,\u201d the letter says. \u201cWe ask, \u2018How can test data be valid under testing conditions like this?\u2019\u201d\n\nKoch had heard the concerns before area superintendents sent him the letter, dated Jan. 30.\n\nIllinois is one of only 10 states, plus Washington, D.C, implementing the PARCC assessment, which is aligned with the new Common Core learning standards. More than a dozen states have pulled out of PARCC in part of a nationwide backlash to either PARCC, the Common Core or both.\n\nMany school superintendents, including the superintendent of Chicago Public Schools, are not opposed to Common Core. But CPS Superintendent Barbara Byrd-Bennett has taken the boldest stands against implementing PARCC.\n\nBoth the Illinois State Board of Education and the U.S. Department of Education have said school districts are subject to the loss of federal and state funding if they fail to administer the test to all students who are not exempt from taking the test. But Byrd-Bennett has pushed ahead with plans not to give the test at a majority of Chicago\u2019s schools because many schools do not have the necessary infrastructure.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to do what the state asks us to do,\u201d said Bob Bardwell, superintendent of Congerville-Eureka-Goodfield District 140, who initiated the letter among his colleagues in the Central Illinois Valley District of Illinois Association of School Administrators. \u201cBut we wanted to be on record sharing our concerns.\u201d\n\nPARCC Letter to ISBE\n\nUS DOE Response Letter\n\nAll District PARCC Letter 1 -30-15\n\nPam Adams can be reached at 686-3245 and padams@pjstar.com.
