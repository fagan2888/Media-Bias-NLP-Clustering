Lynn Jenkins, a Topeka Republican who defeated a Democratic incumbent in 2008 to earn a seat in Congress.\n\nWakefield, a Lawrence attorney, is conducting a grassroots, modest-budget campaign that has emphasized personal contact with potential voters.\n\nShe has been rolling through the 2nd District, which stretches from Nebraska to Oklahoma and includes Topeka and Lawrence.\n\nIt is not uncommon to see her on the road in a vehicle pulling a trailer displaying a massive Wakefield sign.\n\n\u201cPeople are so receptive to you,\u201d she said. \u201cThey're interested, engaged and they want new leadership.\u201d\n\nWakefield told the women in Atchison that political conversations in Washington, D.C., had to be overhauled through election of candidates dedicated to working with allies and rivals on policy reform.\n\n\u201cEveryone says this partisan blame-gaming has got to stop,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile Wakefield worked the district in northeast Kansas, incumbent Jenkins was hundreds of miles away grappling in Washington with a federal budget extension and a measure endorsing President Barack Obama\u2019s plan to arm and train moderate Syrians to counter an emerging terrorist threat. Jenkins said in a news release the House was moving ahead with legislation, despite inaction on dozens of other bills by the U.S. Senate.\n\n\u201cThe American people deserve a government that works,\u201d she said. \u201cThe president and the Senate are banking on inaction and blame carrying the day. The House is moving forward, but we need willing negotiating partners.\u201d\n\nIn interviews and a flurry of emails, the Wakefield and Jenkins campaigns agreed to an exchange of questions posed to their opponent.\n\nTo Wakefield: Do you support construction of the Keystone Pipeline and how do you support cap-and-trade measures passed by the House in 2009?\n\n\u201cThe Keystone Pipeline is already build through Kansas,\u201d Wakefield said, \"so passing it will not be creating any new jobs in Kansas, contrary to my opponent's rhetoric. We just need to make certain that there is adequate oversight in order to avoid breaks and, in the event that leaks occur, that we have an effective, planned response to disasters.\"\n\n\u201cCap and trade is a pretty old idea to help promote renewable energy that is going nowhere in Congress,\u201d she said. \u201cThe more effective direction now is providing incentives for renewable energy like the production tax credit that has proven effective in creating thousands of new, high-wage wind energy jobs in Kansas.\u201d\n\nTo Jenkins: Who are the \u201cladies\u201d you referenced who believe gender pay equity is condescending?\n\n\u201cI strongly support equal pay for equal work, and I\u2019m proud to live in a country where it's illegal to discriminate in the workplace,\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cThere is still discrimination and where it exists, we need to stop it. However, I don\u2019t support dividing America for political gain.\n\n\u201cThe focus should be on ways to create equal opportunities, better paying jobs, more freedom and the ability to choose your own doctor and health care plan so that all Americans \u2014 regardless of gender \u2014 can succeed.\"\n\nTo Wakefield: Have you ever taken it upon yourself to write your member of Congress? If so, what did you write her about?\n\n\u201cI don't remember when I've written my member of Congress or about what, but I probably have,\u201d Wakefield said.\n\nTo Jenkins: Why do you and Republican colleagues in the House pass mountains of partisan legislation that has no chance of passing the Senate?\n\n\u201cOf the over 350 House-passed bills that are awaiting action in the Senate, 98 percent of them passed with bipartisan support, 50 percent passed with no opposition, 70 percent passed with more than two-third support and over 55 of bills were actually introduced by House Democrats,\u201d Jenkins said.\n\n\u201cIt takes a pretty out-of-touch partisan liberal to look at those facts and claim the House is the body that is being partisan. The facts would suggest the House is doing its job and the Senate is not.\u201d\n\nTo Wakefield: Do you support or oppose the current funding formula for the Affordable Care Act?\n\n\u201cThis is a strange question as the ACA has many funding streams,\u201d Wakefield said.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "State, Tim Carpenter", "og": {"url": "http://cjonline.com/news/state/2014-09-20/wakefield-works-atchison-finds-frustration-political-tone-dc", "type": "article", "image": "http://cjonline.com/sites/default/files/13717870.jpg", "site_name": "CJOnline.com", "title": "Wakefield works Atchison, finds frustration with political tone in D.C."}, "description": "ATCHISON \u2014\u00a0Congressional candidate Margie Wakefield's walking tour of aviator Amelia Earhart's hometown elicited a campaign pitch to three women installing colorful glass art to low concrete walls in an industrial stretch of the downtown beneath a bridge.Her conversation with mortar-dabbled Patty Boldridge, Christy Harris and Deborah Geiger opened with dismay for the nation's inadequate public funding of the arts and of the partisan combat dominating the nation's political epicenter."}, "article_summary": "To Wakefield: Do you support construction of the Keystone Pipeline and how do you support cap-and-trade measures passed by the House in 2009?\nIt is not uncommon to see her on the road in a vehicle pulling a trailer displaying a massive Wakefield sign.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not free to practice creativity, you\u2019ll suffer,\u201d said Geiger, executive director of the Atchison Art Association.\nWakefield, a Lawrence attorney, is conducting a grassroots, modest-budget campaign that has emphasized personal contact with potential voters.\n\u201cI don't remember when I've written my member of Congress or about what, but I probably have,\u201d Wakefield said."}
