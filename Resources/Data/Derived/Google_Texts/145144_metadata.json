Apparently, in Dr. Ablow\u2019s view, a sporting event that is carefully planned and scheduled years in advance and occurs every four years is really just a scheme by the White House to get people to pay attention and talk about something other than the \u201cissues\u201d that this president is facing. Thankfully, based on the absolute idiocy of Ablow\u2019s claims, the rest of the panel members quickly refuted him. When you have Kimberly Guilfoyle telling you that you\u2019ve crossed a line, then you\u2019ve likely gone too far.\n\nBelow is video of Ablow\u2019s remarks, courtesy of Media Matters:\n\nSeriously, this guy is a psychiatrist? I think he\u2019s the one in need of psychiatric help. Sheesh.\n\nThis is taking the whole \u2018Obama is using X event to distract the American people from X scandal\u2019 meme way too far. If I was just shown this clip cold, without the knowledge that it was aired on Fox News, I would have sworn this was a Saturday Night Live skit. That is how utterly ridiculous Ablow\u2019s comments are. This man seriously said that he\u2019s suspicious of this event, feeling that it is being used by Obama to distract everyone from pressing international and domestic issues. Dr. Ablow is certifiable.\n\nOf course, this isn\u2019t the first time Ablow\u2019s made insane comments when discussing the President of the United States. In a column for FoxNews.com, Ablow stated that President Obama believes he is God\u2019s instrument for implementing a new world order and needs to make America less powerful. Vladimir Putin realized Obama\u2019s psychological defects and took advantage of this by snatching Crimea away from Ukraine.\n\nHow then could Vladimir Putin fail to notice the remarkable presence on the world stage of an American counterpart (Barack Obama) who is as interested as he is in disempowering the United States? How could he fail to act on the remarkable symmetry of such a moment in history? To not test the possibility that God intends him to be the instrument of a new world order, based on Russia\u2019s manifest destiny, would be contrary to every fiber in his being. To go further, I do not believe that Vladimir Putin would miss the fact that Barack Obama has imperiled the notion of individual autonomy (by seeking to disarm Americans, by seeking to make Americans dependent on unemployment checks and food stamps and by making it officially impossible to choose how to spend your own money, via the Affordable Care Act). Since giving each individual the right to power is not the goal of this American President, why would Putin believe that taking power from others would be opposed vigorously by this President\u2019s Administration?\n\nLast month on Outnumbered, Ablow decided to psychoanalyze the President once again. This time, he focused on POTUS\u2019 commencement speech at West Point. Ablow felt that President Obama hates the American people because he has been abandoned so many times in his life.\n\nABLOW: Well, when a president takes office and immediately apologizes for the country he\u2019s leading and goes on an apology tour, when he says \u201cYou didn\u2019t build that business\u201d so if you thought you were using capitalism and your own smarts to build something, you didn\u2019t. He\u2019s a dispiriting president who has it in for the American public, and he masterfully \u2014 why? Um, well, because I think he \u2014 well, it\u2019s a long story, but I think he distrusts autonomy. I think people abandoned him in his life again and again and again, and individual decision-making is anathema to him. He hates it.\n\nI believe Dr. Ablow needs to see a doctor ASAP.
