This would provide health coverage to more than 100,000 low-income people who now lack insurance.\n\nBut any discussion of participating in the act, also known as Obamacare, remains politically toxic for Republican state officials.\n\nGov. Mary Fallin has often railed against Obamacare, GOP legislative leaders want nothing to do with it and state Attorney General Scott Pruitt has a lawsuit against subsidies provided under the act to at least 55,000 Oklahomans.\n\nAlex Weintz, the governor\u2019s spokesman, said the state can\u2019t afford such an expansion, even though the federal government would pay most of the costs and a state-commissioned study indicated a net financial benefit to the state.\n\nSome Republican-controlled states like Indiana and Arkansas have found a way to take federal funds under the act to boost health care coverage, but that remains a non-starter here.\n\n\u201cIt is not something we\u2019re pursuing,\u201d Weintz said. \u201cWe don\u2019t think the state can take on the additional costs required.\u201d\n\nHealth coverage important\n\nStill, the importance of bringing health coverage to more Oklahomans is highlighted on the new website, www.OKStateStat.ok.gov, a so-called \u201cdashboard\u201d intended to allow policymakers and the public to track state agencies\u2019 progress toward achieving five statewide goals, involving 50 statewide programs and 160 strategic objectives.\n\nCurrently, 17 percent of Oklahomans lack health insurance. The objective calls for reducing this to 9.5 percent by 2019.\n\n\u201cFewer uninsured people in the state can benefit the overall health system by reducing the level of spending on uncompensated care and reduce the number of people who avoid treatments for financial reasons,\u201d the website explains.\n\nDavid Blatt, director of the Oklahoma Policy Institute, said Medicaid expansion should be obvious.\n\n\u201cExpanding coverage to unhealthy low-income adults would be the biggest thing we can do to drive down untreated mental illness, obesity, diabetes,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the only path.\u201d\n\nA state-commissioned study known as the Leavitt report found that, although the federal government would cover most of the expansion, the direct cost to Oklahoma would be about $850 million over 10 years. But the report indicated the net impact would be a savings to the state of $464 million when taxable income associated with the additional spending was taken into consideration.\n\nMedicaid expenses\n\nWeintz said the state is having difficulty covering existing Medicaid expenses for about 800,000 people, without covering another 100,000 people.\n\n\u201cThe governor continues to say it\u2019s not fiscally prudent to expand a program that we are currently having a hard time paying for,\u201d he said.\n\nBlatt takes issue with this stance since the Leavitt report indicated a net savings for the state.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the equivalent of saying I can\u2019t take a job because it\u2019s going to cost me additional money in gas, clothing and childcare, without considering I\u2019d also make a salary,\u201d he said. \u201cThey look at the expenditure side only, so that\u2019s not a look at a full or fair picture.\u201d\n\nHouse Speaker Jeff Hickman, R-Dacoma, and Senate President Pro Tem Brian Bingman, R-Sapulpa, have taken stands against Obamacare.\n\nBolster rural hospitals\n\nHouse Minority Leader Scott Inman, D-Del City, said federal financial support for expanded Medicaid would return to Oklahoma the money state residents pay in federal income tax and would bolster struggling rural hospitals.\n\n\u201cOther Republican governors are bringing their federal dollars home to take care of their citizens but this governor says, no, we\u2019re not going to accept any of our federal dollars, instead we\u2019re just going to wag our finger and tell folks they need to eat better and smoke less.\u201d\n\nAs for the goal on the state\u2019s new dashboard website, the explanation for how the number of uninsured Oklahomans can be drastically reduced between now and 2019 is less than specific:\n\n\u201cStrategies to achieve this goal include increasing outreach to those eligible for Medicaid or low-cost health insurance, and developing strategies to expand affordable insurance programs in the state.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Expanding Oklahoma\u2019s Medicaid system under the federal Affordable Care Act would provide health coverage to more than 100,000 people who now lack insurance, but any discussion of participating in the act, also known as Obamacare, remains politically toxic for Republicans in the Oklahoma Legislature.", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 NewsOK.com.
