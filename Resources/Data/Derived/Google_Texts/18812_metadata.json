I want to make sure they get medical insurance, but despite hours researching the issue, I am still not sure how to go about it.\n\nThe Statue of Liberty stands tall in New York Bay, a beacon to immigrants worldwide.

The rules that apply to legal aliens are the same as those that apply to U.S. citizens. If your parents cannot afford the insurance premiums, they will qualify for a federal subsidy. If you don\u2019t get health insurance by the end of March, they could face penalties.\n\nPermanent residents qualify for Medicare (a federal health insurance program) if they have worked in the U.S. for a total of 40 quarters \u2014 10 years. U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents at least age 65, who have been here five years, may buy into Medicare if they don\u2019t have the work history. Individuals who qualify to buy in to Medicare can choose to participate in Medicare, or buy Obamacare insurance. Individuals who have \u201cpremium free\u201d Medicare or Medicaid are not eligible for Obamacare.\n\nMedicaid is a need-based health insurance program for individuals with little or no income. In some states, including New Jersey, you cannot get full Medicaid until you have been a permanent resident for five years. You can, however, get Medicaid reimbursement for emergency services. In other states, including New York, all permanent residents who meet the income qualifications can get Medicaid.\n\nIn any event, every noncitizen here legally qualifies for some type of medical insurance.
