But the question that remains is how to balance the two so that protocol is neither a rigid \u201ccookbook\u201d nor dubious \u201cgut instinct.\u201d\n\nCompared to a decade ago, there is more opportunity for incorporating evidence-based medicine because the body of evidence has increased in recent years.\n\n\u201cAs the scientific knowledge base in behavioral science establishes firmer ground, there is a wider acceptance among clinicians to use evidence-based practices,\u201d says Raymond Garcia, MD, medical director for Rosecrance\u2019s Harrison campus, in Rockford, Ill. \u201cUsing new tools to enhance diagnostic accuracy and determine more specific etiologies for behavioral health conditions, we will be better able to individualize care.\u201d\n\nFor example, there are genetic assays that show promise in guiding treatment options based on the individual\u2019s ability to metabolize certain medications. And, he says, clinicians are starting to use the tests to choose specific medications, especially in individuals who have had poor outcomes previously. New technologies can help at the initial diagnosis stage as well.\n\n\u201cEnhanced/functional brain imaging studies can be used in aiding diagnosis, especially as costs come down,\u201d says Garcia.\n\nPolicy influence\n\nProvisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) that foster quality-based reimbursement models and pressure from insurance companies are also driving the use of evidence-based approaches. More insurers are expecting providers to use step therapy and obtain patients\u2019 coverage approvals after a medical review process.\n\n\u201cIf you want to get reimbursed, you\u2019d better be able to demonstrate scientific research and treatment efficacy,\u201d says Constance Scharff, senior addiction research fellow and director of addiction research, Cliffside Malibu in California. \u201cIf there is any influence that is causing clinicians to lean toward following pathways and guidelines, it comes from government regulation and insurance companies. It is not uncommon for an insurance company to require the use of certain treatments first before they will approve other treatment options.\u201d\n\nRosecrance ensures an evidence-based approach by having committees routinely review and approve any new clinical practice. In addition, Garcia says, no clinical practice is implemented before a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is written, and staff are trained to ensure compliance with the practice. However, he notes, at Rosecrance, clinicians have the latitude to individualize care and are expected to provide a client-centered approach that includes shared decision making.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t believe that evidence-based practices and shared decision-making are mutually exclusive,\u201d he says.\n\nRecent research, such as STAR-D, for example, has supported this combined approach, according to Garcia, and relying on one approach to the detriment of the other doesn\u2019t benefit the patient.\n\nEvidence-based approaches have their limitations, many practitioners argue. Evidence is based on statistical analyses and outcomes, but human beings are undeniably complex. What\u2019s more, the factors that contribute to behavioral health issues are myriad, according to Garcia. Statistics do not account for these individual nuances, no matter how well a study is controlled.\n\n\u201cLook at what has recently occurred in the release of the DSM-5,\u201d he says. \u201cThere was serious consideration to eliminating personality disorders as a category completely, and there have been significant changes in the diagnosis of certain disorders, such as autism. Under these conditions, I find it difficult to reliably say that a certain practice is \u2018gospel.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to a client centered approach and shared decision making, what is most important is that the approach improves adherence to treatment recommendations and improved outcomes, Garcia says. Indeed, the evidence-based movement will never fully supplant the more patient-centered approach.\n\n\u201cTraining programs are now incorporating the client centered approach and teaching trainees how to practice shared decision making,\u201d says Garcia.\n\nAddiction treatment is also becoming more evidence-based because the 12-Step program on its own and rehabilitation treatment is often limited to 30 days, which is not particularly effective in the real world, according to Scharff.\n\n\u201cWhat is happening today,\u201d she says, \u201cis that Cliffside Malibu and other addiction treatment centers are using a host of holistic, complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) approaches, which are increasingly evidence-based, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, equine therapy, mindfulness meditation, acupuncture, and nutritional regimens\u2014all of which have neuroscience and evidence-based research behind them.\u201d\n\nAlong with using CAM treatment, addiction specialists are also using new generation medications, such as the buprenorphine and naloxone combination as a long-term treatment for opioid addiction. As harm reduction, the medication attempts to treat the symptoms of addiction using an evidence-based approach.\n\n\u201cThis doesn\u2019t get to the underlying cause of the problem,\u201d she says. \u201cWe now know scientifically that, through techniques such as mindfulness meditation, we can rewire our brain in positive ways and avoid using pharmacological therapies.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages04.net,assistedhousingfinancialinsider.com,assistedhousinginsider.com,commercialleaselawinsider.com,constructionsuperconference.com,efaconference.com,secure.rhq.com,secure2.rhq.com,www.addictionpro.com,www.apartmentlawinsider.com,www.assistedhousinginsider.com,www.behavioral.net,www.commercialleaselawinsider.com,www.commercialtenantsleaseinsider.com,www.communityassociationinsider.com,www.constructionsuperconference.com,www.entjournal.com,www.environmentsforaging.com,www.etouches.com,www.fairhousingcoach.com,www.hcd11.com,www.healthcare-informatics.com,www.healthcarebuildingideas.com,www.healthcaredesignmagazine.com,www.herdjournal.com,www.ihealthtran.com,www.landlordvtenant.com,www.ltlmagazine.com,www.nycapartmentlaw.com,www.taxcredithousinginsider.com,www.vendomegrp.com,www.vendomerealestatemedia.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "com.silverpop.cothost": "engage4.silverpop.com"}, "article_summary": "As harm reduction, the medication attempts to treat the symptoms of addiction using an evidence-based approach.\n\u201cIf you want to get reimbursed, you\u2019d better be able to demonstrate scientific research and treatment efficacy,\u201d says Constance Scharff, senior addiction research fellow and director of addiction research, Cliffside Malibu in California.\nAddiction treatment is also becoming more evidence-based because the 12-Step program on its own and rehabilitation treatment is often limited to 30 days, which is not particularly effective in the real world, according to Scharff.\n\u201cTraining programs are now incorporating the client centered approach and teaching trainees how to practice shared decision making,\u201d says Garcia.\nBehavioral health clinicians increasingly are using treatments that combine evidence-based medicine\u2014which incorporates clinical pathways, scientific studies and electronic medical records\u2014with more traditional patient-centered, shared decision-making approaches."}
