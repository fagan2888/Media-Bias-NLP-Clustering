The City Council is scheduled at 10 a.m. May 25 to adopt a budget, which will go to the Nevada Department of Taxation for review. The fiscal year starts July 1.\n\nMore than half of the city\u2019s proposed $532 million budget is for public safety: 34 percent for police and 24 percent for the fire department. Police are seeking a 6 percent increase in funding over last year and fire is seeking a 3 percent increase.\n\nPolice Chief Jason Soto said Reno has twice the number of square miles than it had 25 years ago but has the same level of staffing, about 315 sworn positions. His budget request was for 19 additional staff, although the police department could use more.\n\n\u201cIdeally, with the population we have and the square mileage we cover, we\u2019d need about 50 more police officers, so it shows you the great work our officers are doing,\u201d Soto said.\n\nReno is still not back at its levels in 2008, when the last recession hit. City Manger Andrew Clinger said he\u2019s met with each department director about their budgets and saw no frivolous requests.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no department that has enough resources, let alone excess resources,\u201d Clinger said.\n\nCity finance director Robert Chisel was questioned about the 20 percent cost increase for health insurance, which includes coverage for retirees. He said this was the first cost increase in 6 years and said he doesn\u2019t think the Affordable Care Act was a factor, but rather an aging population.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s natural as you get older that healthcare costs go up,\u201d Chisel said. \u201cThe Affordable Care Act had been around 4 or 5 years prior. We aren\u2019t seeing any changes in the Affordable Care Act driving all this.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement", "article_metadata": {"description": "The 2017 fiscal year\u2019s budget is taking shape as the Reno City Council carefully combed through it Tuesday, analyzing and questioning various expenditures.", "generator": "Seriously Simple Podcasting 1.14.6", "og": {"site_name": "This is Reno", "description": "The 2017 fiscal year\u2019s budget is taking shape as the Reno City Council carefully combed through it Tuesday, analyzing and questioning various expenditures.", "title": "City Council Examines Preliminary FY17 Budget", "url": "http://thisisreno.com/2016/05/city-council-examines-preliminary-budget/", "image": "http://thisisreno.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/City-of-Reno-Arch-1-of-1.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-05-04T15:19:26+00:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://thisisreno.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/City-of-Reno-Arch-1-of-1.jpg", "description": "The 2017 fiscal year\u2019s budget is taking shape as the Reno City Council carefully combed through it Tuesday, analyzing and questioning various expenditures.", "site": "@thisisreno", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "City Council Examines Preliminary FY17 Budget"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 551468291535482, "pages": 115824080447}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://i1.wp.com/thisisreno.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ThisisReno_Logo.png?fit=260%2C260", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/ThisIsReno/", "published_time": "2016-05-04T11:23:06+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-04T15:19:26+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd5729\"", "article_summary": "We aren\u2019t seeing any changes in the Affordable Care Act driving all this.\u201dAdvertisement\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act had been around 4 or 5 years prior.\nThe City Council is scheduled at 10 a.m. May 25 to adopt a budget, which will go to the Nevada Department of Taxation for review.\nBy Carla O\u2019DayThe upcoming fiscal year\u2019s budget is taking shape as Reno City Council members carefully combed through it Tuesday, analyzing and questioning various expenditures.\nHe said this was the first cost increase in 6 years and said he doesn\u2019t think the Affordable Care Act was a factor, but rather an aging population."}
