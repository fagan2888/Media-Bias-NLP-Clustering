Among those ages 18-64, 27.3 percent were vaccinated, ranking 50th.\n\nIn comparison, Massachusetts ranked first for vaccination rates: 57.5 percent among those 6 months and older and 48.5 percent among those ages 18-64.\n\nRich Hamburg, deputy director of the Trust for America\u2019s Health, said the U.S. overall needs to improve its vaccination rates, since fewer than half of Americans received a flu shot during the 2012-2013 season.\n\n\u201cNo matter what the number is in a particular state the goal is to really establish a norm, a cultural norm, of annual flu vaccinations to make sure that we have mechanisms in place to be better able to vaccinate all Americans,\u201d he said.\n\nArizona\u2019s flu season started in October and will end sometime in mid-spring. Through early this month, the Arizona Department of Health Services reported 1,016 cases.\n\nJennifer Tinney, program director with The Arizona Partnership for Immunization, said the state\u2019s warm weather can lead to nonchalance when it comes to the flu.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s 70 degrees, it\u2019s 80 degrees in December and they think, \u2018Oh you know winter and flu season are far, far away.\u2019 Again, unfortunately, it\u2019s just beginning to creep up at that time,\u201d she said.\n\nWorking-age people, who are most likely to develop the flu, are less likely to get vaccinated because they often balance working full-time with raising a family, Tinney said.\n\nDr. Lisa Villarroel, medical director for epidemiology and disease control for the Arizona Department of Health Services, said adults can spread the flu virus by showing up to work instead of staying home when sick.\n\n\u201cThere is absolutely a culture that\u2019s been bred to not appear weak. And so you go to work no matter what,\u201d Villarroel said. \u201cI think you\u2019d be doing everyone and your supervisors a favor if you did not do that.\u201d\n\nThis season, the most prevalent flu strain is H1N1, often referred to as swine flu, which caused the 2009 pandemic resulting in around 10,000 deaths across the U.S. But this time H1N1 doesn\u2019t pose as much of a threat \u2013 as long as people get a flu shot.\n\n\u201cThe best way to prevent the flu is of course to get vaccinated. This is more effective than any other intervention that people can come up with,\u201d Villarroel said.\n\nHamburg, with the Trust for America\u2019s Health, said the Affordable Care Act may encourage more vaccinations as people test out their new insurance cards. Under the national health reform, flu vaccinations are covered without a co-pay in all states, something Hamburg said will remove the obstacle of payment.\n\n\u201cWe need to remove barriers, whether it\u2019s lack of information or lack of access or lack of resources; to seek out and receive these vaccinations, those are all priorities,\u201d Hamburg said.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Your West Valley News", "description": "PHOENIX \u2013 Arizona ranked near the bottom in its percentage of people receiving flu vaccinations during the 2012-2013 season, an advocacy group reported this week.", "title": "National report ranks Arizona near last in vaccination against flu", "url": "http://www.yourwestvalley.com/health/article_24437e4e-7fa8-11e3-be81-001a4bcf887a.html", "image": {"width": 620, "identifier": "http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/yourwestvalley.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/6/83/6836b53e-7fa9-11e3-aed3-001a4bcf887a/52d97d8a17e09.preview-620.jpg?resize=620%2C589", "height": 589}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@tweetmeme", "card": "summary", "creator": "@"}, "description": "PHOENIX \u2013 Arizona ranked near the bottom in its percentage of people receiving flu vaccinations during the 2012-2013 season, an advocacy group reported this week.", "fb": {"admins": "100001414653607,100006692256060,1527006887", "app_id": 137084026330639}, "keywords": "health", "news_keywords": "health"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd26fb\"", "article_summary": "PHOENIX \u2013 Arizona ranked near the bottom in its percentage of people receiving flu vaccinations during the 2012-2013 season, an advocacy group reported this week.\nUnder the national health reform, flu vaccinations are covered without a co-pay in all states, something Hamburg said will remove the obstacle of payment.\nArizona\u2019s flu season started in October and will end sometime in mid-spring.\n\u201cIt\u2019s 70 degrees, it\u2019s 80 degrees in December and they think, \u2018Oh you know winter and flu season are far, far away.\u2019 Again, unfortunately, it\u2019s just beginning to creep up at that time,\u201d she said.\nJennifer Tinney, program director with The Arizona Partnership for Immunization, said the state\u2019s warm weather can lead to nonchalance when it comes to the flu."}
