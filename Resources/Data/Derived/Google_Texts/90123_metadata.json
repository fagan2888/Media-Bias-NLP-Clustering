The Denver Public Library recently installed its own version of a Little Free Library in a new seating area on the 16th Street Mall downtown, following the example of book-loving renegades who prefer a DIY approach that doesn\u2019t involve a kit and an official charter.\n\nLittle Free Libraries (and their charterless imitators) often are eye-catching, like the mini-Castle Marne Little Free Library, or the libraries evoking the Tardis from \u201cDr. Who,\u201d or giving a nod to \u201cStar Wars\u201d and other pop-culture icons.\n\n\u201cA Little Free Library, in many ways, is a better-sized approach to globalization, a way to help connect your family with your community,\u201d says Little Free Library founder Todd Bol.\n\n\u201cWhat we want to do is set the stage for empowering neighborhoods that are literary deserts, places where 75 percent of the kids aren\u2019t proficient in reading. The key to fixing that is for all the neighborhood residents to feel responsible for the kids. We got rid of polio and measles; we can do this.\u201d\n\nGetting more books into impoverished neighborhoods is a laudable goal, says Dr. Adriann Wycoff, who teaches family literacy at Metro State.\n\n\u201cIn the family literacy program, we spend a lot of time working with families and helping parents understand the value of reading together with their kids for information and pleasure,\u201d she said.\n\nDawn Krebs, a former newspaper editor who lives in Alamosa, situated her Little Free Library in front of the local senior center. She deliberately stocks that particular Little Free Library with large-print books.\n\n\u201cHere in a rural community, we look to see where the need is, and then we fill that need,\u201d Krebs said.\n\n\u201cIn Denver, you can put a Little Free Library in your front yard and people can walk by and use it. Here, people have to drive to a destination. So we steward a Little Free Library together with the Alamosa public library, which provides us with large-print books and the box itself.\u201d\n\nAbout the same time that Krebs installed the senior center\u2019s Little Free Library, a local women\u2019s group posted another Little Free Library next to a local food bank. It\u2019s stocked primarily with children\u2019s books, perhaps the movement\u2019s hottest commodity.\n\n\u201cChildren\u2019s books go right away,\u201d said Jonathon Stalls, steward of a Little Free Library he installed a year ago at 28th Avenue and Forest Street in Denver\u2019s Park Hill neighborhood.\n\nWhen Stalls checked out the inventory last week, he found a Trixie Beldon novel next to \u201cEmory\u2019s Gift\u201d by W. Bruce Cameron; a Nevada Barr mystery; a couple of cookbooks; a AAA map of New Zealand; and \u201cBabayaga,\u201d a novel about witches in Paris.\n\n\u201cAbout once a week, I filter through the books,\u201d Stalls said. \u201cOnce, someone stacked this full of political stuff that blocked everything else.\u201d\n\nHe monitors it not just for political motives but overall quality.\n\n\u201cI try to keep it diverse so it\u2019s not all romance novels, because that\u2019s what this one tends to default to.\u201d\n\nMost people who install Little Free Libraries are conscientious about keeping an eye on the contents. Denver artist Rubin, who inherited her brother\u2019s Little Free Library in 2013, when he upgraded, purged a stack of \u201cReally Gross Joke\u201d books left by a donor with an offbeat sense of humor.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve actually been surprised at how respectfully most people treat the Little Free Library,\u201d she said. \u201cMost people tell me it\u2019s the hot box, because it always has good stuff. We get a lot of children\u2019s and young adult books, and a lot of brand-new books. Right now, I\u2019m reading the new Anne Tyler novel that someone left.\u201d\n\nNot everyone is a fan of Little Free Libraries. Leawood, Kan., got unwanted international attention when the city sent a code-violation letter to Spencer Collins, age 9, after he put up a Little Free Library.\n\nThe city claimed that the dollhouse-sized box was \u201can accessory structure,\u201d a term normally reserved for campers and carriage houses. The backlash was so vehement that the Leawood City Council passed an exemption specifically for Little Free Libraries. Other towns wound up following Leawood\u2019s example.\n\nCareful curating, combined with neighborhood residents\u2019 enthusiasm, helps keep Little Free Libraries successful. Nat and Kathy Fay, who steward a Little Free Library in Congress Park, keep an eye on untoward and unlikely contributions. The most unusual title someone left was \u201cMulti-Family Marketing,\u201d which \u201cis now in the bag to go to Goodwill,\u201d Kathy Fay said.\n\nThe Fays\u2019 Little Free Library was a 2013 Christmas gift that Nat Fay made for his wife. He first presented her with a box that contained a tiny model of what he planned to construct once the ground defrosted.\n\n\u201cThe neighbors on the corner left us a thank-you note for putting it up,\u201d Nat Fay said.\n\n\u201cThey told us they see books they probably wouldn\u2019t have known about. One morning, there was a boxed set of Beatrix Potter. It was gone in less than an hour. I was on the porch once when a guy in a Phillies shirt was looking in the library. I asked if he was from Philly, and he said \u2018yes.\u2019 I told him our daughter went to college there, and he said he\u2019d graduated from the same school.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great way to start conversations with people,\u201d Nat Fay said.\n\nClaire Martin: 303-954-1477, cmartin@denverpost.com or twitter.com/byclairemartin\n\nLittle Libraries by the numbers\n\n28,000 Number of Little Free Libraries\n\n40 million Number of books in circulation annually\n\nHalf a billion Projected number of Little Free Library books in circulation for 2016\n\n150 Number of visits per month to average Little Free Library", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Little Free Libraries take summer reading to the streets (and yards)", "title": "Little Free Libraries take summer reading to the streets (and yards)", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/07/10/little-free-libraries-take-summer-reading-to-the-streets-and-yards/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150710__BN20150711_Z00_BNfe11ahlittlefree2.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150710__BN20150711_Z00_BNfe11ahlittlefree2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-10T11:30:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T15:33:47+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Little Free Libraries (and their charterless imitators) often are eye-catching, like the mini-Castle Marne Little Free Library, or the libraries evoking the Tardis from \u201cDr.\n\u201cA Little Free Library, in many ways, is a better-sized approach to globalization, a way to help connect your family with your community,\u201d says Little Free Library founder Todd Bol.\nRight now, I\u2019m reading the new Anne Tyler novel that someone left.\u201dNot everyone is a fan of Little Free Libraries.\nClaire Martin: 303-954-1477, cmartin@denverpost.com or twitter.com/byclairemartinLittle Libraries by the numbers28,000 Number of Little Free Libraries40 million Number of books in circulation annuallyHalf a billion Projected number of Little Free Library books in circulation for 2016150 Number of visits per month to average Little Free Library\nThe backlash was so vehement that the Leawood City Council passed an exemption specifically for Little Free Libraries."}
