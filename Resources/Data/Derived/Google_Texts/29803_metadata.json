(Damian Dovarganes/AP)\n\nMix blatant bigotry with poor spelling. Add a dash of ALL CAPS. Top it off with a violent threat. And there you have it: A recipe for the worst of online comments, scourge of the Internet.\n\nBlame anonymity, politicians, human nature. But a growing number of Web sites are reining in the Wild West of online commentary. Companies such as Google and the Huffington Post are trying everything from deploying moderators to forcing people to use their real names to try to restore civil discourse. Some sites, such as Popular Science, are banning comments altogether.\n\nThe efforts put sites in a delicate position. User comments add a lively, fresh feel to videos, stories and music. And, of course, the longer visitors stay to read the posts, and the more they come back, the more a site can charge for advertising.\n\nWhat Web sites don\u2019t want is the kind of off-putting nastiness that spewed forth under a recent CNN.com article about the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cIf it were up to me, you progressive libs destroying this country would be hanging from the gallows for treason. People are awakening though. If I were you, I\u2019d be very afraid,\u201d wrote someone using the name \u201cJBlaze.\u201d\n\nYouTube, which is owned by Google, has long been home to some of the Internet\u2019s most juvenile and grammatically incorrect comments. The site caused a stir last month when it began requiring people to log onto Google Plus to write a comment. Besides herding users to Google\u2019s unified network, the company says the move is designed to raise the level of discourse in the conversations that play out under YouTube videos.\n\nOne such video, a Cheerios commercial featuring an interracial family, met with such a barrage of racist responses on YouTube in May that General Mills shut down comments on it altogether.\n\nNearly three-quarters of teens and young adults think people are more likely to use discriminatory language online or in text messages than in face to face conversations, according to a recent poll from the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research and MTV. The poll didn\u2019t distinguish between anonymous comments and those with real identities attached.\n\nThe Huffington Post is also clamping down on vicious comments. The AOL-owned news site said it employs 40 human moderators who sift through readers\u2019 posts for racism, homophobia, hate speech and the like. It also is chipping away at anonymous commenting. Previously, anyone could respond to an article posted on the site by creating an account, without tying it to an e-mail address. This fall, the Huffington Post began requiring people to verify their identity by connecting their accounts to an e-mail address, but that didn\u2019t appear to be enough. The site now also asks commenters to log in using a verified Facebook account.\n\n\u201cWe are reaching a place where the Internet is growing up,\u201d said Jimmy Soni, managing editor of the Huffington Post. \u201cThese changes represent a maturing [online] environment.\u201d\n\nNewspapers are also turning toward regulated comments. Of the largest 137 U.S. newspapers \u2014 those with daily circulation above 50,000 \u2014 nearly 49 percent ban anonymous commenting, according to Arthur Santana, assistant communications professor at the University of Houston. Nearly 42 percent allow anonymity, while 9 percent do not have comments at all.\n\nCurbing anonymity doesn\u2019t always help. Plenty of people are fine attaching their names and Facebook profiles to poorly spelled outbursts that live on long after their fury has passed.\n\nIn some cases, sites have gone further. Popular Science, the 141-year-old science and technology magazine, stopped allowing comments of any kind on its news articles in September.\n\nWhile highlighting responses to articles about climate change and abortion, Popular Science online editor Suzanne LaBarre announced the change and explained in a blog post that comments can be \u201cbad for science.\u201d\n\nBecause \u201ccomments sections tend to be a grotesque reflection of the media culture surrounding them, the cynical work of undermining bedrock scientific doctrine is now being done beneath our own stories,\u201d LaBarre wrote.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "APFN-US-TEC--Taming Online Comments, 2nd Ld-Writethru", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Websites deploy a host of measures to battle online vitriol, with mixed results", "title": "Web sites try to clean up cesspool of online comments", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/web-sites-try-to-clean-up-cesspool-of-online-comments/2013/12/27/520f11a4-6e6d-11e3-a523-fe73f0ff6b8d_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2013/12/28/National-Economy/Images/Taming_Online_Comments-0d3b9-1313.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/web-sites-try-to-clean-up-cesspool-of-online-comments/2013/12/27/520f11a4-6e6d-11e3-a523-fe73f0ff6b8d_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "APFN-US-TEC--Taming Online Comments, 2nd Ld-Writethru", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "eomportal-uuid": "520f11a4-6e6d-11e3-a523-fe73f0ff6b8d", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "description": "Websites deploy a host of measures to battle online vitriol, with mixed results"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb794\"", "article_summary": "And there you have it: A recipe for the worst of online comments, scourge of the Internet.\nPopular Science, the 141-year-old science and technology magazine, stopped allowing comments of any kind on its news articles in September.\n\u201cWe are reaching a place where the Internet is growing up,\u201d said Jimmy Soni, managing editor of the Huffington Post.\nSome sites, such as Popular Science, are banning comments altogether.\nBut a growing number of Web sites are reining in the Wild West of online commentary."}
