The Kaiser Family Foundation produced a calculator that can help people determine how much they can expect to pay by buying insurance on the health care market place.

The calculator is updated to include premium changes from last year and uses zip code specific data to reach a conclusion. It can help people determine whether they're eligible for federal subsidies to offset the cost of buying health insurance.

It can also help tell people whether they're eligible for Medicaid.

To use the calculator, people must have the following information:

Your home state and zip code

Annual household income in dollars or percent of federal poverty level

Whether coverage is available through your or your spouse's job (if it is, you likely don't qualify for federal subsidies)

The number of people in your family

The number of adults and the number of children enrolling in the marketplace.

Open enrollment began Saturday (Nov. 15). This is the second year health care is available through the federally established marketplace, healthcare.gov, which was established by the Affordable Care Act.

This is the first year large employers will have to provide health care to their employees or face stiff penalties from the government. Click here to help determine whether you're a large employer.
