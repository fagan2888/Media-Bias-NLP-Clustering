Less than a day after he crushed a three-run shot to help the Rockies beat the Giants, Colorado’s Gold Glove third baseman Nolan Arenado opted to spend his off day at Cherry Hills Country Club, for the first round of the BMW Championship.

“We had a day off today, so I decided to come out and check out some of these guys and watch how good they are,” said Arenado, who was joined by fellow Rockies Tyler Chatwood, Ben Paulsen, Kyle Parker, Matt McBride and outfielder Drew Stubbs. “It’s amazing to watch them play and how consistent they are.”

The Rockies weaved their way throughout the green on Thursday, trying to blend with the tens of thousands spread across the course, but they could only escape their own fans so much. Requests for autographs and even just a wave were made frequently, and the players seemed happy to oblige.

Arenado said he wasn’t following just one player in particular — “I like following Rickie Fowler, obviously everyone follows Rory, so I like following Rory, (Matt) Kuchar, Bubba Watson, the main guys” — but as a first-timer to a live PGA Tournament, he was more than impressed.

“I love it,” he said. “I’m going to have to do this again.”

The Rockies return to play Friday at Coors Field, where they host the Padres in the first of a three-game homestand.
