A 34-year-old Pennsylvania man was sentenced Monday in Denver’s federal court to 13 years in prison for driving to Colorado in an attempt to have sex with two children.

Federal officials say Matthew Hornung, of Harrisburg, Penn., was arrested after his car broke down and he solicited help from a Colorado State Patrol trooper.

Hornung had arranged to meet the two children after talking with what he thought was their single mother in Greeley, but in fact was an undercover officer.

The trooper arrested Hornung and he was charged in the case in March.

Colorado’s U.S. Attorney’s Office says Hornung also faces 10 years of supervised release after he completes his prison term. He pleaded guilty in June to traveling with intent to engage in illicit sexual conduct with a minor.

The State Patrol and Homeland Security Investigations led the investigation into Hornung.
