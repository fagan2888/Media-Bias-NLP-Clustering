Courtesy: Treston Silva\n\nEarly Saturday morning, two men pulled into the parking lot of this apartment building on Kainehe Street.\n\nIn the video, one of the suspects gets out and takes a quick peek through the passenger window. He makes sure the coast is clear, before attempting to pick the lock.\n\nThat didn\u2019t work, so the suspect went to the other side of the vehicle and busted the backseat window to get in.\n\nTwenty minutes later, the suspects were gone.\n\n\u201cTaking a look at this video, what goes through your mind?\u201d KHON2 asked.\n\n\u201cWhen I first looked at it, it was just shocking to see people are right downstairs while we\u2019re sleeping and just breaking into my car,\u201d said Treston Silva, a Kailua resident. \u201cI just feel like I lost a sense of security, I guess, knowing that it happened at my home.\u201d\n\nBut it didn\u2019t end there. The thieves came back 40 minutes later. They managed to get the car started and drove off.\n\nAs for valuables, the thieves made off with a $4,000 sound system. They also have Silva\u2019s textbooks, which he\u2019ll need since he\u2019s set to graduate from college next month.\n\n\u201cIt just seems like this is an inconvenience at a very bad time,\u201d KHON2 said.\n\n\u201cYes, it\u2019s a horrible time for this to happen, but we\u2019re just happy during this incident, nobody got hurt,\u201d Silva said.\n\nSilva alerted Honolulu police. They told him the car the suspects used to get to his home was stolen.\n\nWe wanted to know if similar crimes were happening in the area. So we checked out HPD\u2019s crime-mapping website. Since March 1, there have been seven auto thefts and 16 car break-ins within a one-mile radius of the latest incident.\n\nWe also reached out to the Kailua Neighborhood Board. The chairperson says they\u2019re well aware of these crimes, and are working with police and neighborhood watch groups.\n\n\u201cIt shows that no matter what neighborhood you live in, it\u2019s always going to have its share of crimes. And that people just need to be more aware and if there is any suspicious activity, just to let HPD know or let anyone in the neighborhood know,\u201d Silva said.\n\nIf you recognize the suspects or have any information about this case, call police.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A brazen auto theft in Kailua.
