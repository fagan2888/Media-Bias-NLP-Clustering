On July 13, 2015 the White House Conference on Aging, a once-a-decade conference sponsored by the Executive Office of the President of the United States, will be held.\n\nThe White House Conference on Aging Conference (WHCoA) is an opportunity to recognize the importance of these key programs as well as to look ahead to the issues that will help shape the landscape for older Americans for the next decade. The Conference makes policy recommendations to the president and Congress regarding older adults.\n\nThis year\u2019s conference will examine four important issues (listed below from the WHCoA website.) The briefs define and frame each issue area and reflect the most current evidence-based information on the issues, and will be the topics of discussion at the Conference.\n\n\n\n\n\nRetirement security is a vitally important issue. Financial security in retirement provides essential peace of mind for older Americans, but requires attention during our working lives to ensure that we are well prepared for retirement.\n\nis a vitally important issue. Financial security in retirement provides essential peace of mind for older Americans, but requires attention during our working lives to ensure that we are well prepared for retirement. Healthy Aging will be all the more important as the number of older Americans continues to rise. As medical advances progress, the opportunities for older Americans to maintain their health and vitality should progress as well and community supports, including housing, are important tools to promote this vitality.\n\nwill be all the more important as the number of older Americans continues to rise. As medical advances progress, the opportunities for older Americans to maintain their health and vitality should progress as well and community supports, including housing, are important tools to promote this vitality. Long-term services and supports remain a priority. Older Americans overwhelmingly prefer to remain independent in the community as they age. They need supports to do so, including a caregiving network and well-supported workforce. The long-term services and supports policy brief reviews five topic areas important to the aging community: informal caregiving, formal services and supports, direct care workers; access to information and services, and financing long-term services and supports.\n\nremain a priority.

Elder justice is important given that seniors, particularly the oldest older Americans, can be vulnerable to financial exploitation, abuse, and neglect. The Elder Justice Act was enacted as part of the Affordable Care Act, and we need to realize its vision of protecting seniors from scam artists and others seeking to take advantage of them.\n\n\n\n\n\nA tentative agenda for the Conference is:\n\n9:00 to 11:20 a.m. Welcome, President Obama\u2019s Remarks, and Panel Discussions on Caregiving and Financial Security\n\n11:20 a.m. to 12:20 p.m. Break for Lunch\n\n12:20 to 3:20 p.m. Panel Discussions on Healthy Aging, Elder Justice and Technology\n\n3:20 to 3:30 p.m. Closing\n\nThe White House Conference on Aging will be streamed live on the internet from 9am to 3:30 pm Central time on Monday, July 13.
