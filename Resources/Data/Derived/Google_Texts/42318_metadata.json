Will they be respected and preserved?\" Severino also told the Catholic News Agency.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The United States' Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) recently put forth a controversial proposal that may make doctors vulnerable to lawsuits if they recognize only two genders, which are well rooted in biological sex and Biblical teachings.", "title": "Doctors in U.S. recognising only 'male' and 'female' genders may soon face lawsuits", "og": {"image": "http://d2.christiantoday.com/en/full/30950/man-and-woman.png", "description": "The United States' Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) recently put forth a controversial proposal that may make doctors vulnerable to lawsuits if they recognize only two genders, which are well rooted in biological sex and Biblical teachings.", "title": "Doctors in U.S. recognising only 'male' and 'female' genders may soon face lawsuits"}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "p": {"domain_verify": "035da258d4370c219fc1e27db5605a75"}, "MobileOptimized": 320, "Keywords": "christian news,christianity,evangelical,transgender discrimination,transgender rights,transgender equality,Biblical gender roles,Obamacare", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "On the other hand, gender identity is defined as \"an individual's internal sense of gender, which may be different from an individual's sex assigned at birth.\"\n\"HHS has exceeded its authority and is going against the intent of Congress,\" Scruggs told the Catholic News Agency, insisting that \"sex\" under the law means \"biological sex.\"\nThe proposed new rule, which falls under U.S. President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act, prohibits medical practitioners from discriminating against transgender individuals.\n\"HHS is supposed to apply the law faithfully, not go beyond the terms of the law.\"\n(Wikipedia)It seems like the biblical fact that God only created two genders\u2014male and female\u2014is becoming more and more unacceptable for modern society."}
