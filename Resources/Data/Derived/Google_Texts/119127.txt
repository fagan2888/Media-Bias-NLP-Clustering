Last time we saw the Democratic candidates take the podium on CNBC, four of the total six running were present and we were anxiously awaiting Vice President Joe Biden to make his announcement about running.

Now, the Democratic field has shrunk from six to only three -- Hillary Clinton, Martin O'Malley and Bernie Sanders. Jim Webb, Lincoln Chafee, and Lawrence Lessig have all dropped out since the last debate, the latter of whom did not even qualify to take part.

Since Clinton was judged the winner of the previous debate, the former Secretary of State needs to maintain her lead over Sanders and O'Malley.

As for Sanders , Saturday will be "perhaps his best chance to slow [Clinton's] political momentum this fall," according to The New York Times O'Malley, on the other hand, just needs to speak up. After a "lethargic" performance in the past debate, former governor of Maryland is last in the polls. This night is his time to shine or risk becoming the next candidate to drop out.The debate airs on CBS at 9 pm on Saturday, Nov. 14. CBS News will also be streaming the event live online.
