Johnson says people of all faiths, or no faith, are welcome too.\n\nAs preparations enter the home stretch, volunteers have been dispatched throughout Orange, Osceola and Seminole counties in recent weeks to register participants and find out their needs.\n\nDeshunda Lindsay, a Sanford mother of two school-aged girls, was among those who signed up. At 43, the divorced former nurse has struggled to keep a roof over her head \u2014 and not always succeeded.\n\n\"I've slept on people's couches, in parking lots, in my car when I had one,\" she says.\n\nHome is now a two-bedroom rental with no heat, broken pipes, a ceiling that has partially collapsed and mildewed carpet. She has no job, poorly controlled diabetes and difficulty walking.\n\n\"What do I expect at the event?\" she says. \"I have no idea. Something. Anything. But at least it will get the kids out of the house, and even if it's not a turning point for me, it might be for someone else.\"\n\nSo far, the numbers have not approached the high expectations \u2014 just 5,000 people have signed up to participate. But spokeswoman Vicki Johnson (no relation to the pastor) notes that registration is not mandatory and says a big push in the final days should increase numbers dramatically.\n\nThe Orlando Serve Foundation, the nonprofit organizing the event, also needs more volunteers and money. To date, about 2,500 people have signed up to help, and donors have contributed about $400,000 \u2014 plus $600,000 to $700,000 worth of services and products. But Tim Johnson said he would like to bring in another $150,000 in cash donations to provide more for the guests.\n\nBut some are concerned such funds might be better spent.\n\nRobert Brown, president and CEO of the Heart of Florida United Way, says he was approached by organizers to participate but declined.\n\n\"We have funding priorities, and this kind of an event \u2014 with free haircuts and food and music \u2014 just doesn't fit in,\" Brown says. \"The United Way just feels the money could be used for better things, like housing.\"\n\nAlready, logistics are massive: Free shuttle bus service for He Got Up will start from 44 locations throughout the tri-county region at 6:30 that morning and run until 9 a.m., the official start time for the event itself. Return buses will run from shortly before noon to 6 p.m.\n\nParticipants will be greeted at a \"VIP\" area, where they'll be given a beverage, a hygiene kit from the Orlando nonprofit Clean the World and the opportunity to choose \"gently used\" clothing.\n\nFrom there, the kids will head to a supervised recreation area for games, activities and entertainment while adults can take a shower, get a haircut, learn CPR or sign up for food stamps, Medicaid or health insurance through Obamacare. They also can learn how to manage chronic health conditions, attend a job fair or get screening to resolve legal problems.\n\nStarbucks and Hilton Grand Vacations have pledged to hire workers at the event, Vicki Johnson said.\n\nAnd Orange-Osceola Chief Judge Frederick Lauten has agreed to hold a special court session May 20 to try to resolve outstanding cases and fines for residents in his jurisdiction.\n\n\"We don't really know the scope of it yet,\" Lauten said, \"but we want to do whatever we can to help. If someone has an outstanding felony warrant, it's unlikely we'll be able to do much. But if we're talking about outstanding court costs, there's a much better chance.\"\n\nFor those who qualify financially, he noted, court costs can be dropped in exchange for charitable service.\n\nLauten, like many, has adopted a wait-and-see attitude on his expectations for the Easter event itself. So has Andrae Bailey, CEO of the Central Florida Commission on Homelessness.\n\n\"I'm a huge fan of Pastor Tim and I believe in his leadership,\" Bailey says. \"So even if he's going down roads that make some people nervous, I know he is stepping out in faith, and he's trying to do something that we've never done before.\"\n\nTo register, volunteer or learn more, go to HeGotUp.com\n\nksantich@tribpub.com or 407-420-5503", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Easter's 'He Got Up' plans massive service for poor", "date": "2016-03-12", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Orlando Sentinel", "author": "Orlando Sentinel", "og": {"site_name": "OrlandoSentinel.com", "description": "Organizers say Easter's \"He Got Up\" celebration at the Citrus Bowl on March 27 will be the largest service event and resource fair ever held in the United States, drawing at least 25,000 homeless and impoverished people for food, help and inspiration.", "title": "Easter's 'He Got Up' plans massive service for poor", "url": "http://www.orlandosentinel.com/features/religion/os-he-got-up-easter-homeless-20160311-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56e40d55/turbine/os-he-got-up-easter-homeless-20160311", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp11.17", "twitter": {"site": "@orlandosentinel", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "He Got Up, Citrus Bowl, Orlando, Orlando World Outreach Center", "fb": {"admins": 100004353067097, "page_id": 5779052556, "app_id": 890804050949750}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=402223551, app-argument=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/deeplinkid/86190853", "googlebot-news": "index", "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "news_keywords": "He Got Up, Citrus Bowl, Orlando, Orlando World Outreach Center", "y_key": "fb73650ad672fe45", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "Description": "Part homeless-service project, part job fair, part Easter service, He Got Up has some grand plans for the big day at the Citrus Bowl."}, "article_summary": "Pastor Tim Johnson Orlando Serve Foundation Pastor Tim Johnson Pastor Tim Johnson (Orlando Serve Foundation) (Orlando Serve Foundation)\"I feel like Jesus is pleased,\" says Johnson \u2014 senior pastor of Orlando World Outreach Center, president of the nonprofit Orlando Serve Foundation and former stand-out NFL defensive lineman.\nPastor Tim Johnson, the man who created it, says it's merely what Jesus would do.\nBut Tim Johnson said he would like to bring in another $150,000 in cash donations to provide more for the guests.\n\"I'm a huge fan of Pastor Tim and I believe in his leadership,\" Bailey says.\nThe Orlando Serve Foundation, the nonprofit organizing the event, also needs more volunteers and money."}
