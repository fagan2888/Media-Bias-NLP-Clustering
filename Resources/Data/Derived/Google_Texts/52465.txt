The list of House Republicans opposing John Boehner's re-election for speaker of the house continues to grow.

Republicans will vote on their House leadership when they return to Capitol Hill on Tuesday, and a handful have now come out saying they will not vote to re-elect Boehner as speaker — a number that needs to be 29 to actually endanger his re-election.

According to Bridenstine, Boehner has aligned with President Obama on too many issues — including the debt ceiling.

"Speaker Boehner went too far when he teamed with Obama to advance this [CR/Omibus] legislation. He relinquished the power of the purse, and with it he lost my vote," Bridenstine said in a statement.

Louie Gohmert of Texas and Ted Yoho of Florida have both come out against Boehner — and have also said they will run for the speakership.

Six other House Republicans are on record against Boehner. They are Paul Gosar (Arizona), Thomas Massie (Kentucky), Marlin Stutzman (Indiana), Walter Jones (North Carolina), Dave Brat (Virginia) and Steve King (Iowa).

"We need a speaker who will help us all keep our oath, including his own, to the Constitution, not one who has consistently blocked our efforts to keep ours. I will vote for an alternative candidate for speaker. I can’t vote for John Boehner again," King said in a Sunday op-ed.
