There isn\u2019t much evidence that this is true.\n\nThere are, in many circumstances, growth effects from lower tax rates, sometimes large ones, and these can offset the expected revenue losses associated with tax cuts. But in the context of a complex, modern economy in a developed country without absurdly confiscatory tax rates, what that means is that tax cuts may produce only 80 cents in lost revenue for each $1 predicted by so-called static-scoring models. Growth effects might offset 4 cents on the dollar of revenue losses, or 20 cents, or 55 cents, but they do not offset 100 cents on the dollar, much less 125 cents on the dollar. Arguments to the contrary usually fall into the error of attributing 100 percent of economic growth (and associated growth in tax revenue) to tax cuts, when that is almost certainly in error.\n\nThe second story is the fairy tale called \u201cStarve the Beast.\u201d This version is economically more realistic but politically a fantasy. It takes to heart Milton Friedman\u2019s advice about self-funding tax cuts: \u201cIf a tax cut increases government revenues, you haven\u2019t cut taxes enough.\u201d The idea behind Starve the Beast is that if you cut revenue enough, then either fiscal pressure or political pressure will inspire politicians to make spending cuts that they otherwise wouldn\u2019t make.\n\nStarving the Beast hasn\u2019t worked at the federal level, because the Beast has excellent credit and owns a factory that allows it to throw a switch and exnihilate into existence all the Beast-Treats it likes. Every election cycle, the out-of-power party gets religion about public debt and deficits: Remember Senator Obama\u2019s declaring George W. Bush \u201cunpatriotic\u201d because of the debt that was run up during his presidency? Once back in power, those same politicians tend to worry a great deal less about deficits. The Starve the Beast theory relies on shame and eventual rectitude at the federal level to eliminate deficits, and it fails like all political models based on Washington\u2019s capacity for shame and its care for rectitude.\n\nBut might it work at the state level, where legislatures generally are bound to balance their budgets, at least on paper, from year to year?\n\nLet\u2019s check in with Governor Sam Brownback and his colleagues in Kansas.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to be righteous about the other guys\u2019 tax-cut shenanigans. But these are shenanigans.\n\nGovernor Brownback\u2019s first tax-cut proposal was much more restrained than the one that the legislature eventually passed. It significantly reduced income-tax rates but offset many of those rate cuts by eliminating many credits and deductions, including those for mortgage interest and child care, along with the state\u2019s earned-income tax credit. Brownback\u2019s original proposal also left standing a plan to increase the state sales tax, which would have offset some of the losses from the income-tax rate reductions. (Relatively high sales taxes and property taxes, and not mere thrift, is how states such as Texas manage without a state income tax.) That model \u2014 cut rates but eliminate deductions \u2014 will be familiar to those who follow federal tax-reform efforts.\n\nThe legislature did what legislatures always do: It kept the popular bits (the rate cuts), jettisoned the unpopular bits (the offsets), and sent the result to the governor, who signed it.\n\nThis has made Governor Brownback a hate totem for Democrats across the country. But before they go getting on their high fiscal horses, Democrats should consider the fact that their likely presidential nominee, Hillary Rodham Clinton, wants to keep the expensive parts of the Affordable Care Act but nix the unpopular bits that help pay for it, especially the \u201cCadillac tax\u201d on the generous health-care packages enjoyed by her union-goon constituency. It\u2019s easy to be righteous about the other guys\u2019 tax-cut shenanigans.\n\nBut these are shenanigans.\n\nState government in Kansas is mainly a money-launderer: It collects revenue that local governments forgo collecting and then distributes it to those municipalities and school districts, a pass-through that accounts for about half of state spending. Much of the rest of the money goes to familiar expenditures: roads and other state-maintained infrastructure, state universities, and compensation for the state\u2019s not-inconsiderable work force.\n\nWhen Governor Brownback first started talking about large tax cuts, the story for public consumption was na\u00efve supply-side: A more business-friendly Kansas would boom, and new jobs and investment would offset the projected revenue losses. That didn\u2019t happen, and it\u2019s not entirely clear that anybody really expected it to, inasmuch as Kansas Republicans were talking Starve the Beast from Day One. Representative Owen Donohoe, for example, said that the new fiscal dispensation was \u201cthe greatest thing that\u2019s ever happened to Kansas,\u201d and that it would \u2014 here\u2019s the delusional part \u2014 \u201cforce us to be more efficient.\u201d That\u2019s a nice story, as he told it: \u201cIf we become more efficient, that means we provide the same if not better services to the people, and we do it at a lesser cost and save money.\u201d\n\nBut that isn\u2019t what happened. It never is.\n\nKansas just passed a new budget (in the middle of the night, allowing editorialists and speech-writers to deploy one of their favorite clich\u00e9s: \u201cunder cover of darkness!\u201d) that imposes general cuts (3 percent for most state agencies), large cuts to highway spending, significant cuts to the state universities, and \u2014 this part is indefensible \u2014 it delays state payments to the fund that sustains its government-employee pensions, putting Kansas on the same unfunded-liability slippery slope that has helped to make New Jersey and Illinois . . . New Jersey and Illinois.\n\nWorse, all that doesn\u2019t even balance the budget, as required by Kansas law: The legislature\u2019s budget bill would call upon the governor to balance the budget with unspecified spending cuts, a proposal that Democrats rightly have derided as \u201cmagic money.\u201d\n\nThere is good and bad and ugly in this. Kansas isn\u2019t a bloated mess like California, but its agencies probably could stand 3 percent spending cuts, though the presence of uniform, across-the-board reductions usually means that the question has not been examined in sufficient detail. If all the cuts are enacted and Brownback delivers on the magic-money reductions, then Kansas\u2019s cash reserves will grow from $27.4 million to $81 million, which would be excellent. But that extra cash is dwarfed by the $96 million in pension-fund obligations that the state will be refusing to pay until 2018. Those obligations do not go away simply because the state treasurer doesn\u2019t write the check: They remain, and grow, with interest.\n\nUnserious men promise to Starve the Beast and balance budgets by eliminating \u201cwaste, fraud, and abuse,\u201d the formulation relied upon by, among others, Donald Trump, 2016\u2019s poster-boy for terminal unseriousness. Delusional politicians insist that significant tax cuts can be offset by simple gains in efficiency \u2014 but if it were that simple, then why not implement those cost-saving measures first and the tax cuts afterward?\n\n(Answer: Because it is not simple.)\n\nWe are not going to balance the federal budget without cutting Social Security and other popular entitlements as well as the military.\n\nThere are gross spending abuses at every level of government, from Harry Reid\u2019s federally subsidized cowboy-poetry festivals to million-dollar paydays for superintendents of small suburban school districts. These are work for the meat cleaver, not the scalpel. But about 80 percent of what the federal government does is Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and other health-care spending, national defense, and paying interest on debts incurred by previous Congress\u2019s refusal to implement taxes sufficient to pay for that spending. Most of what state and local governments spend their money on is public schools, state universities, police, roads, and ordinary municipal services. Yes, it\u2019s bonkers that Lubbock, Texas, spends about a quarter-million a year on a city manager, but that\u2019s still chump change compared with what schools and police cost.\n\nWe are not going to balance the federal budget without cutting Social Security and other popular entitlements as well as the military, and Kansas is not going to bring its spending down to match a lower revenue line without touching education and the roads. It isn\u2019t going to happen.\n\nYes, conservatives believe in smaller government, but conservatives also believe in prudence \u2014 and that our political calculations must in the end take account of reality. And here\u2019s the reality that every politician eventually discovers: You can promise to Starve the Beast, but in the end, the Beast is Us.\n\n\u2014 Kevin D.
