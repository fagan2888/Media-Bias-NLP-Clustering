This law will amend the Affordable Care Act (ACA) [text] by changing businesses with 51-100 employees to a \"large employer\" designation instead of the current \"small employer\" designation. States will have the option of treating currently designated small employers as such if the business employs 100 or fewer employees during 2015 and at least one employee on January 1, 2016. The law will also create funding for a Medicare Improvement Fund to be available for services beginning in 2020. Obama has signed 13 amendments [Congressional Research Service report, PDF] to the ACA since the law's inception, but this amendment marks the first time in four years that Republicans in Congress passed a bipartisan measure designed to improve the functionality of the ACA.\n\nComprehensive health care reform [JURIST backgrounder] was passed by Congress in March 2010, and recent legal challenges have reinvigorated debate.
