BIRMINGHAM, Alabama â€“ Most people who bought insurance under the Affordable Care Act will be able to renew their plans and their subsidies next year without filing an application, the Obama administration announced.

Under procedures announced this week about 95 percent of those who bought the insurance through the federal government's exchange will have their policies and financial assistance automatically renewed, The New York Times reports. Only those who want to enroll in a different plan or whose income has changed will have to take action to keep the insurance.

Automatic renewal is being implemented in a bid to avoid a repeat of the problems consumers faced when trying to enroll in the program's initial open enrollment period, Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell told the Times. The next open enrollment period runs from Nov. 15 to Feb. 15, 2015.

About 5.4 million policies were sold through the federal ACA exchange. Alabama was among the states that declined to create its own exchange, opting instead to let its residents buy insurance through the federal system. More than three quarters of the policies are subsidized using tax credits that are deducted from premiums.
