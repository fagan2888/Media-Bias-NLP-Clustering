It's not hard to spot the devolution of The New Republic from think pieces to clickbait for morons.\n\nThe liberal media is rapidly being divided into two categories. Prestige publications subsidized by a billionaire and clickbait.\n\nOn the one hand you have the Washington/Amazon Post. On the other Buzzfeed. But the problem with being a billionaire liberal's toy is that he may just decide that he wants value for his money. That's what happened to the New Republic.\n\nJust after celebrating its 100th anniversary, The New Republic has lost its top two editors, as Frank Foer and Leon Wieseltier resigned their posts, in the face of pressure from owner Chris Hughes to dramatically revamp the magazine. Gabriel Snyder, formerly of Gawker, Bloomberg and The Atlantic Wire, will be the new editor, as TNR looks to become, in Hughes\u2019s phrase, \u201ca digital media company.\u201d\n\nSnyder was Gawker's managing editor which tells you all need to know. If you don't know what Gawker is, imagine a nastier version of the Huffington Post.\n\nIt's a long way down from being the prestige publication of liberalism. But this happened to Slate too when Bill Gates got tired of subsidizing a former New Republic editor's experiment. These days Slate occasionally runs journalistic pieces, but mostly goes with lefty clickbait and its most popular feature is a made up advice column that is little more than an edgier Dear Abby.\n\nThe usual eulogies are being written with little to no honesty in the mix. What killed the New Republic is that there was no marketplace for its offerings. The audience on the left most valued by advertisers is not looking for deep thoughts, it wants sheer raw hate.\n\nThat's what sites like Gawker or the Huffington Post deliver really well.\n\nIt wants memes, snide remarks about how stupid Republicans are and how all of America's problems can be fixed with 3D printers and a TED talk.\n\nEven before the resignations, The New Republic had already begun turning into Slate or New York Magazine. Its leading stories have Buzzfeedy and Slate titles like \"This Radiohead Song Perfectly Explains John Boehner's Immigration Problem\" and \"Russia's Maternity Leave for Expectant Mothers Puts America's to Shame\".\n\nThere's an ad that's indistinguishable from a news story. The front page is clotted with worthless viral content pandering to a dimmer class of progressives who want their ideas pre-chewed and vomited into their mouths. Call it the Chris Hughes demo.\n\nThe New Republic is already indistinguishable from Slate, Salon and a host of similar sites. It's brain dead, but so is liberalism.", "article_metadata": {"rating": "general", "description": "The media is rapidly being divided into two categories.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Frontpage Mag", "description": "The media is rapidly being divided into two categories.", "title": "The New Republic Goes Full Gawker", "url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/point/246774/new-republic-goes-full-gawker-daniel-greenfield", "updated_time": "2015-06-22T23:42:50-04:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/point/246774/new-republic-goes-full-gawker-daniel-greenfield", "description": "The media is rapidly being divided into two categories.", "card": "summary", "title": "The New Republic Goes Full Gawker"}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-06T03:21:14-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-22T23:42:50-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd879\"", "article_summary": "It's not hard to spot the devolution of The New Republic from think pieces to clickbait for morons.\nThat's what sites like Gawker or the Huffington Post deliver really well.\nThe New Republic is already indistinguishable from Slate, Salon and a host of similar sites.\nBut this happened to Slate too when Bill Gates got tired of subsidizing a former New Republic editor's experiment.\nEven before the resignations, The New Republic had already begun turning into Slate or New York Magazine."}
