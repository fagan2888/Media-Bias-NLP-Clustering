When GOP senatorial candidate John Raese declared that having to place \u201csmoke-free environment\u201d stickers on buildings he owned was the \u201csame thing\u201d as Jews being forced to wear yellow Stars of David, and when eventual GOP presidential candidate Ben Carson claimed the Affordable Care Act \u201cin a way \u2026 is slavery,\u201d what was revealed was not some new insight on stop-smoking campaigns and health care reform, but, rather, the historical illiteracy, incapacity for reverence and utter imbecility of the two men and anyone dumb enough to believe them.\n\nSo yes, ordinarily I loathe such comparisons. Yet I\u2019m here to make one. Because, as more than one observer has noted, the parallels between the rise of Adolf Hitler and that of Donald Trump have become too neon to ignore.\n\nLike Hitler, Trump has watched approvingly as his followers use violence to silence hecklers, dissenters and protesters.\n\nLike Hitler, Trump offers few real plans or strategies for confronting the nation\u2019s challenges, giving voters instead the assurance that he, by force of personality alone, will defeat them.\n\nLike Hitler, Trump has presented the electorate a scapegoat for its fears and vulnerabilities. Hitler gave his people the Jews. Trump has given his the Muslims.\n\nLike Hitler, Trump proposes to register, surveil and restrict the scapegoat populace. Nor, like Hitler, is he overly concerned with the niceties of civil or human rights. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to do certain things that were frankly unthinkable a year ago,\u201d he has said.\n\nIt is in that context that Rose Hamid stood up two weeks ago in South Carolina.\n\nHamid, a 56-year-old Muslim flight attendant attending a Trump rally in Rock Hill, came to her feet and stood silently as Trump equated refugees from Syria with ISIS terrorists. She was wearing a hijab and a blue T-shirt that said, \u201cSalam, I come in peace.\u201d Several others stood in solidarity.\n\nThis passive protest was enough of a provocation that the audience began chanting their leader\u2019s name like a mantra \u2014 \u201cTrump! Trump! Trump!\u201d \u2014 and a police officer escorted Hamid out. She told CNN that while some Trump followers apologized to her, others pelted her with abuse.\n\n\u201cGet out!\u201d one person shouted.\n\n\u201cYou have a bomb?\u201d another cried.\n\nIt all brings home something that has become glaringly obvious: While many of us have lamented Trump\u2019s improbable rise to political prominence, the real problem is not him and never was. Rather, the problem is that thing deep down in some of us that responds to him, that small, primeval thing so filled with uncertainty, fear and fury that it will suspend both logic and compassion to worship a man whose very name has become a symbol of all that is hateful and violative of American ideals.\n\nNo, Trump is not Hitler. Hitler was a singular figure who committed a singular crime. Nor do I believe Trump will even be president. But his dominance of the Republican field is instructive just the same, offering vivid evidence of the depth of alienation on that side of the political spectrum. The rest of us ignore or underestimate that alienation at our own peril. The threat it poses to our hopes for a just and inclusive America is real and grave and should be treated as such.\n\nTo read of how fascism stole over Germany is to repeatedly ask yourself how an enlightened nation could have fallen for such transparent garbage. Well, the answer is unfolding before us in real time, and it ought to horrify good people into taking a stand.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=1;polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=5; cycle=1", "googlebot": "noarchive", "application-name": "Columbia Tribune", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/windows8_favs/wide.png?_dc=1372340732", "twitter": {"site": "@columbiatribune", "description": "As a general rule, I loathe both Holocaust and slavery comparisons.", "card": "summary", "title": "Trump's antics should scare you"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#065874", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/windows8_favs/tiny.png?_dc=1372340614", "og": {"url": "http://www.columbiatribune.com/opinion/columnists/trump-s-antics-should-scare-you/article_e5f021ba-e9b9-501a-b77b-79ef4e9eb33d.html", "type": "article", "site_name": "Columbia Daily Tribune", "description": "As a general rule, I loathe both Holocaust and slavery comparisons.", "title": "Trump's antics should scare you"}, "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/windows8_favs/large.png?_dc=1372340596", "p": {"domain_verify": "e84f2ccdbb23b2303cfa08c12e9bd926"}, "fb": {"app_id": 299470460147166}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/windows8_favs/t-badge_144.png?_dc=1372343381", "keywords": "donald trump,politics,election 2016", "msvalidate.01": "1E3A617C7822235CF7453A03AC560148", "google-site-verification": "Pa-FtOcowtRH8XQjoX9dIrD_ncPLS80pMIWeoJZyZnA", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/windows8_favs/square.png?_dc=1372340606", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes", "description": "As a general rule, I loathe both Holocaust and slavery comparisons."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe00d8\"", "article_summary": "Like Hitler, Trump has watched approvingly as his followers use violence to silence hecklers, dissenters and protesters.\nLike Hitler, Trump has presented the electorate a scapegoat for its fears and vulnerabilities.\nLike Hitler, Trump proposes to register, surveil and restrict the scapegoat populace.\nLike Hitler, Trump offers few real plans or strategies for confronting the nation\u2019s challenges, giving voters instead the assurance that he, by force of personality alone, will defeat them.\nIt all brings home something that has become glaringly obvious: While many of us have lamented Trump\u2019s improbable rise to political prominence, the real problem is not him and never was."}
