Hanen.\n\n\u201cWhether by ignorance, omission, purposeful misdirection, or because they were misled by their clients, the attorneys for the government misrepresented the facts,\u201d the judge said, adding that he was stunned the government waited months before coming forward.\n\nSEE ALSO: Judge accuses Obama lawyers of misleading him, refuses to restart amnesty\n\nLate Tuesday, Judge Hanen issued an order rebuking the administration and granting Texas, which is suing to halt the amnesty, limited discovery in the case. For now, that means the government must turn over documents showing its thought process on how it was planning to carry out the amnesty.\n\nJudge Hanen also shot down the Justice Department\u2019s request to lift an injunction and restart the amnesty immediately, either nationwide or at least in some states where governors have asked for it. The judge said he\u2019s more convinced than ever that Mr. Obama broke federal law when he announced the amnesty last November.\n\nIn particular, Judge Hanen said the president\u2019s declaration in a televised town hall in February that agents who ignored his policies would face \u201cconsequences\u201d shows Mr. Obama intended to rewrite the law, not to carry it out.\n\nSEE ALSO: Court\u2019s \u2018Dreamer\u2019 ruling could undercut efforts to block amnesty\n\n\u201cIn summary, the chief executive has ordered that the laws requiring removal of illegal immigrants that conflict with the 2014 DHS directive are not to be enforced, and that anyone who attempts to do so will be punished,\u201d Judge Hanen wrote.\n\nThe White House defended Mr. Obama\u2019s policies as \u201ccommon sense\u201d \u2014 but spokesman Josh Earnest also stumbled, calling them \u201clegislative action\u201d before correcting himself. Under the Constitution, only Congress can write legislation, while the president is charged with carrying out the laws, not writing them.\n\n\u201cWe continue to have strong confidence in the legal arguments that we\u2019re making,\u201d Mr. Earnest said, adding that they already had an appeal pending of Judge Hanen\u2019s earlier injunction, and will pursue that review.\n\nMeanwhile, the Justice Department bristled at the judge\u2019s accusation that government lawyers misled him.\n\n\u201cWe emphatically disagree with the district court\u2019s order regarding the government\u2019s statements,\u201d department spokeswoman Emily Pierce said.\n\nJudge Hanen\u2019s rulings capped a busy day that saw both sides of the immigration debate notch victories and defeats.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals tossed out a challenge to Mr. Obama\u2019s 2012 amnesty for Dreamers, finding that neither Mississippi nor immigration enforcement agents, both of whom had sued to stop that amnesty, had standing in court.\n\nImmigrant rights activists said that bodes well for their cause because that same appeals court is hearing the appeal of Judge Hanen\u2019s injunction.\n\nBut some legal analysts said Texas and its fellow states have argued their case differently, including presenting specific evidence of economic harm from Mr. Obama\u2019s latest amnesty, which could earn them standing where Mississippi failed.\n\nFor now, the 2012 amnesty for Dreamers remains operational, granting more than 600,000 young adult illegal immigrants tentative legal status and work permits for two years. But Judge Hanen\u2019s injunction has halted the 2014 amnesty, leaving millions of other Dreamers and illegal immigrant parents who stood to benefit still in limbo \u2014 though Mr. Obama has said he won\u2019t deport them anyway.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Justice Department denied Wednesday that it had lied to a federal judge about President Obama's deportation amnesty, with a spokeswoman saying they \"emphatically disagree\" with the court's decision granting limited legal discovery requiring them to turn over private documents showing their decision-making in the case.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The Justice Department denied Wednesday that it had lied to a federal judge about President Obama\u2019s deportation amnesty, with a spokeswoman saying they \u201cemphatically disagree\u201d with the court\u2019s decision granting limited legal discovery requiring them to turn over private documents showing their decision-making in the case.", "title": "Obama admin. fires back: Justice Dept. lawyers insist they didn\u2019t lie to court over amnesty", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/8/justice-dept-lawyers-we-didnt-lie-about-amnesty/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/07/Obama.JPEG-07c6b.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/07/Obama.JPEG-07c6b.jpg", "description": "The Justice Department denied Wednesday that it had lied to a federal judge about President Obama's deportation amnesty, with a spokeswoman saying they \"emphatically disagree\" with the court's decisio", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama admin. fires back: Justice Dept. lawyers insist they didn\u2019"}, "Author": "Stephen Dinan", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Law Crime, Politics, Andrew S Hanen, Barack Obama"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe09c0\"", "article_summary": "Earnest said, adding that they already had an appeal pending of Judge Hanen\u2019s earlier injunction, and will pursue that review.\nJudge Hanen\u2019s rulings capped a busy day that saw both sides of the immigration debate notch victories and defeats.\nThe judge said he\u2019s more convinced than ever that Mr. Obama broke federal law when he announced the amnesty last November.\nThe White House defended Mr. Obama\u2019s policies as \u201ccommon sense\u201d \u2014 but spokesman Josh Earnest also stumbled, calling them \u201clegislative action\u201d before correcting himself.\nImmigrant rights activists said that bodes well for their cause because that same appeals court is hearing the appeal of Judge Hanen\u2019s injunction."}
