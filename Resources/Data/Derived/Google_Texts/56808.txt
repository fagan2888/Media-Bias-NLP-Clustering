Maple syrup hikes a sweet way to get ready for spring

hello

We're still a ways away from April showers, not to mention May flowers, but spring is just around the corner, and for outdoors enthusiasts that means maple syrup.

The Lake County Forest Preserve District continued its annual maple syrup hikes Sunday at Ryerson Woods near Riverwoods.

Led by forest preserve district nature educators, participants on the one-hour hikes got to see the sap collection process up close, then headed over to an evaporator to learn how the sap becomes syrup.

Everyone got to taste of the final product.

Ryerson Woods is one of the few places in Lake County where conditions are right for maple syrup production, and where the trees grow to a diameter and height that allows for tapping, according to the forest preserve.

Syrup production only happens in late winter and early spring.

The final hikes are planned for Saturday, March 19, and Sunday, March 20. Registration is required at www.LCFPD.org or by calling (847) 968-3321.
