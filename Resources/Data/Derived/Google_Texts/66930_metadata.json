Prior to his diagnosis, he was a 27-year-old on his grind in New York City, more interested in his budding filmmaker career than the growing pain in his groin and abdomen. At least that was the case before his \u201cleft testicle swelled to the size of an orange,\u201d Cantley told Men\u2019s Health, and he made it to the doctor to find out he had stage 3 testicular cancer.\n\nIn the process of getting his testicle surgically removed, Cantley found out there was no \u201cblunt, honest talk about what to expect,\u201d in terms of fertility or sex drive. Even before that, Cantley hadn\u2019t been educated on the early signs of testicular cancer; he decided to be that voice. \u201cCancer was my rebirth,\u201d Cantley said. \u201cI need to be infectious. \u2026 I need to create attention.\u201d\n\nCantley started by rolling a 6-foot-wide, giant rubber ball from Toronto to Vancouver to raise awareness \u2014 an homage to the testicle he lost. He rolled during the day, towed the ball on the back of a rented car at night, and talked to anyone he passed along the way. Known as Mr. Ballsy himself, Cantley didn\u2019t only make that 2,000-plus-mile trek, but he started a second \u201cball push\u201d this past September. Only this time he\u2019ll get the awareness ball rolling from New York to Los Angeles.\n\nCantley \u201cquit his job, sold his house, and left everything but his dog Vader to push a giant ball across America for men\u2019s health,\" as written on his website. His journey is fueled by the food, shelter, and gas offered to him by the generous people he passes along the way, as well as his straight up determination to get young men to check their balls. Testicular cancer is the number one cancer that affects men ages 15 to 35, and when caught early, it\u2019s totally treatable.\n\nWatch the video below for more information on Cantley's #BeBallsy campaign. We wonder if Hugh Jackman is as nuts over the idea as we are.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "thomas, cantley, testicular, cancer, survivor, going, balls, out, raise, awareness, across", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Thomas Cantley survived testicular cancer, and he wants to help other young men do the same.", "title": "One Man Is Balling Out Across The USA For Testicular Cancer [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/thomas-cantley-testicular-cancer-survivor-going-balls-out-raise-awareness-across-america-306210", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/03/thomas-cantley.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Thomas Cantley survived testicular cancer, and he wants to help other young men do the same.", "title": "One Man Is Balling Out Across The USA For Testicular Cancer [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/thomas-cantley-testicular-cancer-survivor-going-balls-out-raise-awareness-across-america-306210", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/03/thomas-cantley.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/03/thomas-cantley.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Conditions", "published_time": "2014-10-03T16:17:27-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-03T16:17:27-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Thomas Cantley survived testicular cancer, and he wants to help other young men do the same."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdad0b\"", "article_summary": "Testicular cancer is the number one cancer that affects men ages 15 to 35, and when caught early, it\u2019s totally treatable.\nEven before that, Cantley hadn\u2019t been educated on the early signs of testicular cancer; he decided to be that voice.\nThomas Cantley was diagnosed with testicular cancer in 2009.\nOnly this time he\u2019ll get the awareness ball rolling from New York to Los Angeles.\nKnown as Mr. Ballsy himself, Cantley didn\u2019t only make that 2,000-plus-mile trek, but he started a second \u201cball push\u201d this past September."}
