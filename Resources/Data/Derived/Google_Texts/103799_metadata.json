Pent-up frustration? Probably a mixture of both.\n\nDickerson\u2019s solo home run to right-center field in the 10th inning off Oliver Perez lifted the Rockies to a 5-3 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks at Chase Field on Sunday afternoon. Dickerson\u2019s homer, his 14th, came on 78 mph, 0-1 curveball.\n\n\u201cIt was great for the team,\u201d Dickerson said. \u201cI went out there looking for something out over the plate. He (quick-pitched) that second pitch, and I just used my hands as a reaction. It was a line drive, and I thought it was going to hit the wall, but it just carried out.\n\n\u201cI was just pretty excited for our team. It put us ahead in a good situation. I thought we needed that today.\u201d\n\nEspecially after being embarrassed Saturday night in a 14-4 loss in which the Diamondbacks scored nine runs in the eighth inning. Entering Sunday\u2019s game, the Rockies had lost 20 of their previous 22 road games. They remain tied with the Texas Rangers for the worst record in baseball (46-71), on pace to go 64-98.\n\nIf ever a team needed a cast of late-inning heroes, it was the Rockies.\n\nWATCH: Corey Dickerson on game-winning homer\n\nPHOTOS: Colorado Rockies beat Arizona Diamondbacks, 5-3\n\nColorado added a bonus run in the 10th on an RBI single by Wilin Rosario. He drove in Brandon Barnes from second. Barnes reached on a bunt single and advanced to second when Perez plunked Nolan Arenado. Closer LaTroy Hawkins struck out the side in the 10th for his 18th save.\n\nThe Rockies\u2019 beleaguered bullpen pulled off a Houdini act in the ninth. Arizona kept running traffic at lefty reliever Rex Brothers, who looked to be in dire straights when he walked Didi Gregorius and Ender Inciarte and gave up a single to Aaron Hill in his two-thirds of an inning. But Brothers cut down Gregorius at second on a bunt to the mound. Then, with the bases loaded, Brothers induced David Peralta to ground out to Charlie Culberson at short, who calmly threw home for a forceout.\n\n\u201cIt was an instinctual play,\u201d Brothers said of his critical throw to second. \u201cI heard Wilin (Rosario) yell, \u2018Two!\u2019 So that\u2019s where I was going with it.\u201d\n\nInto the breach came right-handed reliever Matt Belisle to face right-handed cleanup hitter Mark Trumbo. Belisle got Trumbo to hit a slow roller to first baseman Ben Paulsen, squelching the Diamondbacks\u2019 would-be rally.\n\n\u201cIt was easy,\u201d weary Rockies manager Walt Weiss said, managing a smile. \u201cIt got a little hairy there in the ninth. Rex has been grinding through some things, but we got some big outs. To be able to win a game like that \u2014 we needed it.\u201d\n\nBefore the game, Hawkins, in his 20th year in the majors, talked about how important it is for the Rockies to salvage something from what has been a disastrous, injury-plagued season.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to be a part of an organization\u2019s first 100-loss season, that\u2019s for sure, \u201d he said. \u201cThere have been some sleepless night\u2019s lately trying to figure this out. It\u2019s been utterly disappointing, and embarrassing.\n\n\u201cThe guys haven\u2019t quit, but it\u2019s been frustrating. We haven\u2019t quit, but when you lose this much, everything gets magnified to the 20th degree. We haven\u2019t been able to put any of the puzzle pieces together.\u201d\n\nMercurial starter Franklin Morales gave the Rockies some needed stability early. The lefty pitched six innings, allowing three runs (two earned) on five hits.\n\nColorado scored four of its five runs via the long ball. Paulsen hit a two-run homer in the second off Arizona starter Wade Miley. The ball bounced into the swimming pool beyond the wall in right-center field. It was the first home run of Paulsen\u2019s major-league career, coming on a 1-0 slider.\n\nPaulsen was recalled from Triple-A Colorado Springs on Sunday, replacing the ailing Carlos Gonzalez on the 25-man roster. CarGo was placed on the 15-day disabled list because of a right ankle sprain and lingering patella tendinitis in his left knee.\n\nRosario made amends for a throwing error by hitting a one-out, solo home run in the sixth, tying the game 3-3. It was Rosario\u2019s 10th home run of the season.\n\nPatrick Saunders: psaunders@denverpost.com or twitter.com/psaundersdp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Corey Dickerson\u2019s 10th-inning home run lifts Rockies past Diamondbacks", "title": "Corey Dickerson\u2019s 10th-inning home run lifts Rockies past Diamondbacks", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/10/corey-dickersons-10th-inning-home-run-lifts-rockies-past-diamondbacks/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140810__rockies-dickersonp1.jpg", "height": 488}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140810__rockies-dickersonp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-10T18:04:03+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T07:00:35+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "WATCH: Corey Dickerson on game-winning homerPHOTOS: Colorado Rockies beat Arizona Diamondbacks, 5-3Colorado added a bonus run in the 10th on an RBI single by Wilin Rosario.\nDickerson\u2019s solo home run to right-center field in the 10th inning off Oliver Perez lifted the Rockies to a 5-3 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks at Chase Field on Sunday afternoon.\nIf ever a team needed a cast of late-inning heroes, it was the Rockies.\nWe haven\u2019t been able to put any of the puzzle pieces together.\u201dMercurial starter Franklin Morales gave the Rockies some needed stability early.\nRosario made amends for a throwing error by hitting a one-out, solo home run in the sixth, tying the game 3-3."}
