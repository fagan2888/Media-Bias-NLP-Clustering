Everyone has to understand the realities of the budget,\u201d he said.\n\nTom DeGeorge, a teacher at Center Township Elementary School who represents the district's 526 teachers, said the two sides are closer than they were.\n\nMore talks are scheduled for Wednesday. The contract is a one-year extension of a five-year deal that expired in June 2014.\n\nThe union is concerned about the district's proposal to pass more health care costs onto teachers, DeGeorge said.\n\n\u201cThey want a lot of changes in the plan: high deductibles, higher premiums and co-pays. We have offered to introduce gradual changes, phasing this in,\u201d he said.\n\nTeachers now pay $30, $60 or $90 toward their health care each month, depending on their plan.\n\nEmployees paying more of their health care is inevitable and under consideration in many districts, said Jim Buckheit, director of the Pennsylvania Association of School Administrators.\n\nIn 2018, the Affordable Care Act's so called \u201cCadillac\u201d tax will hit insurance and related perks valued at more than $10,200 for singles and $27,500 for families.\n\nTaxing such benefits is a major policy shift in generations-old tax policy and has many opponents, including the National Education Association.\n\n\u201cThere are pretty severe financial penalties with this. The new health care law requires consumers to have some skin in the game,\u201d Buckheit said.\n\nTypically, government employees have had generous benefits. In Pennsylvania, state employees contribute 4 percent of their pay to benefits.\n\nThis year, Butler Area's starting annual salary for teachers is $42,393. The average teacher's salary, about $50,000 this school year, will be lower next year after 21 teachers retire.\n\nThese are lean financial times for the district. This month, the school board voted 6-3 for a proposed budget that does not raise taxes but contains a $4.5 million deficit. It would be closed by taking from cash reserves, putting the accounts below the state's recommended level.\n\nThe budget does not factor in $1.9 million in state money the district expects to receive, however.\n\nPressure was great to avoid a tax increase, said board member Bill Halle, who, like Convery, voted against the budget.\n\n\u201cA lot of the board members are struggling with our contract and the comparison with the real world of business. Many people in the private sector are paying five times or more and getting far less of a health plan,\u201d Halle said.\n\nHe wants to pay teachers enough to keep the good ones, and scrimp on other expenses.\n\n\u201cI'd rather see them scrap a lot of the new technology than get rid of teachers. Technology gets outdated; teachers don't,\u201d he said\n\nRick Wills is a staff writer for Trib Total Media.
