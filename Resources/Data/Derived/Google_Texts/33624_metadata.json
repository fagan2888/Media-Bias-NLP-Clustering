It\u2019s very, very clear.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good day. It\u2019s such a good day,\u201d said Julie Kornack, senior public policy analyst at the Center for Autism and Related Disorders, an advocacy group based in Tarzana. \u201cWhenever you get a decision that we\u2019ve been seeking for years, that is a good day.\u201d\n\nApplied behavior analysis treatment, known as ABA therapy, now is a benefit for those under age 21 under the Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis and Treatment (EPSDT) provision of Medicaid \u2014 and therefore it also must be covered under Medi-Cal, California\u2019s version of Medicaid, according to Kristin Jacobson, president of Autism Deserves Equal Coverage, an advocacy group based in Burlingame.\n\n\u201cABA therapy must be covered under EPSDT. It\u2019s very, very clear,\u201d Jacobson said. \u201cAny coverable benefit must be provided under the age of 21. If it\u2019s coverable in any way, then you have to provide it.\u201d\n\nOn top of that, CMS\u2019 new guidance says state officials don\u2019t need to file a State Plan Amendment to start coverage of autism therapy. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be in your state plan, it says it right there,\u201d Jacobson said.\n\nState officials were a little more careful.\n\nAccording to Norman Williams, deputy director of public affairs for the Department of Health Care Services, the health policy experts at DHCS need a bit more time to fully review the guidance.\n\nKornack acknowledged that \u201clawyers are still dissecting the guidance and [that] there\u2019s some leeway here about how states will implement this.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut whether they implement is no longer a question,\u201d she said.\n\nState officials previously have said they were awaiting federal guidance on the question of ABA therapy coverage \u2014 and Kornack, for one, can\u2019t wait to hear the official word from the state.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we could ask for better clarification than what we just got,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s some latitude for states in terms of how to augment the waiver, there will be complexities. But there\u2019s no latitude about whether they provide services. The question about whether they provide it is done.\u201d\n\nJacobson said now it\u2019s just a matter of the time of implementation till Medi-Cal children can access ABA therapy services.\n\n\u201cWhen I look at as clarification of existing requirements, I don\u2019t know how much you could delay it,\u201d she said. \u201cThey have to make it available and accessible, and make families aware that it\u2019s available and accessible. I\u2019d say, if families already have medical necessity established, they should try to pursue coverage right away.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "While Calif. officials are still reviewing the guidance, advocates say the federal decision is clear.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Feds Say Autism Therapy Now Covered As Children's Medicaid Benefit\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2014\\/07\\/08\\/feds-say-autism-aba-therapy-now-covered-as-childrens-medicaid-benefit\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-07-08 12:44:23\",\"mod_date\":\"2014-07-09 14:09:27\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":20073,\"author_id\":\"8344\",\"author_name\":\"State of Health\",\"author_display_name\":\"State of Health\",\"tags\":[\"Autism\",\"Science\"],\"categories\":[\"Policy\",\"Tests &amp; Treatments\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2014\\/02\\/186380264-e1393616709383.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "While Calif. officials are still reviewing the guidance, advocates say the federal decision is clear.", "title": "Feds Say Autism Therapy Now Covered As Children\u2019s Medicaid Benefit", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2014/07/08/feds-say-autism-aba-therapy-now-covered-as-childrens-medicaid-benefit/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2014/02/186380264-640x426.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "autism,science", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd952d\"", "article_summary": "By David Gorn, California HealthlineCMS officials released federal guidance for states on Medicaid coverage of autism therapy on Monday, and that guidance indicates it is covered for beneficiaries under age 21.\nState officials were a little more careful.\n\u201cABA therapy must be covered (by Medi-Cal).\nState officials previously have said they were awaiting federal guidance on the question of ABA therapy coverage \u2014 and Kornack, for one, can\u2019t wait to hear the official word from the state.\nIf it\u2019s coverable in any way, then you have to provide it.\u201dOn top of that, CMS\u2019 new guidance says state officials don\u2019t need to file a State Plan Amendment to start coverage of autism therapy."}
