It\u2019s also a quasi-religious film arriving at a quasi-religious moment in American cultural history, one that self-consciously engages with our nation\u2019s long-standing relationship with the divine and reflects, in all too literal-minded a fashion, what the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life has described as the \u201cvery diverse and extremely fluid\u201d character of American religious belief. Like Darren Aronofsky\u2019s forthcoming epic \u201cNoah\u201d and Mark Burnett\u2019s Jesus biopic \u201cSon of God,\u201d \u201cWinter\u2019s Tale\u201d is calibrated to appeal both to orthodox believers and to at least some secular-minded viewers, especially that growing proportion who don\u2019t consider themselves atheists or agnostics but are not affiliated with any religious denomination.\n\nAll these movies, and others to come, are landing in a climate when the discussion about the role of religion in American life is both heated and intensely confused. We argue about whether or not the United States is in some sense a \u201cChristian nation,\u201d and to be frank, both sides have a point. As good liberals all know, God is never mentioned in the Constitution (and only indirectly in the Declaration of Independence), and the Founding Fathers skewed toward a deistic and pluralistic version of Protestant Christianity that has since slid into deep recession. But it does no one any good to deny that the original American colonies had a strongly religious character, or that the Puritan fundamentalism that drove the Massachusetts Bay Colony \u2014 \u201ca City upon a hill,\u201d as John Winthrop wrote before he even got there \u2014 remains a central force in American culture.\n\nThen we have the accusatory debates between the so-called New Atheists and their opponents (a long-running feature of this publication!), who seem eager to outdo each other in sanctimony. Of course atheists are right that they\u2019ve often been exiled from American public life, or treated like pariahs on the idiotic assumption that you can\u2019t believe in morality if you don\u2019t believe in God. But despite the prominence of a handful of atheist intellectuals like Richard Dawkins or the late Christopher Hitchens, it\u2019s startling to realize that outright nonbelievers remain a tiny minority, well into the 21st century. In the most recent Pew survey of religious belief, only 1.6 percent of responders called themselves atheists, which is almost exactly the same as the proportion of Jews or Mormons. Professed agnostics make up a slightly larger group, at 2.4 percent, and then we get to that growing religious-but-unaffiliated chunk of the population I mentioned above \u2014 around one person in eight \u2014 whom the Pew survey identifies as \u201cnothing in particular.\u201d\n\n\u201cWinter\u2019s Tale\u201d is a spiritual journey for the \u201cnothing in particular\u201d set, and while I know how snide that sounds I don\u2019t entirely mean it that way. I found Goldsman\u2019s adaptation of the 1983 bestseller by Mark Helprin both attractive and repulsive, sometimes at the same moment. It invokes vomit-inducing New Age spiritual clich\u00e9s within its first 10 seconds, when a plummy-voiced English female narrator asks us whether the stars we see in the sky might not be, rather than the distant astronomical fireballs postulated by boring science, the wing-traces of people who\u2019ve ascended as angels. (Or something like that.) Things only get better from there! This is a movie with a flying horse (named Horse), a beautiful doomed princess so feverish with consumption that her bare feet can melt snow (both the narrator and the doomed princess are Jessica Brown Findlay of \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d), Colin Farrell living forever with a New Romantic mid-\u201880s haircut, and Russell Crowe, in a bowler hat and a stage-Irish accent, playing the Chief Demon of New York City. And I bet I\u2019m not supposed to tell you about the major movie star who shows up in a cameo role as a certain fallen angel, the Father of Lies and the Great Seducer of mankind.\n\nClumsy and kitschy as \u201cWinter\u2019s Tale\u201d often is, there\u2019s no denying that it feels like a profoundly and perhaps painfully personal film, in a way Hollywood movies almost never do. (As to the title: There are a few tenuous thematic connections to the strange and terrific Shakespeare play, but nothing worth discussing.) There\u2019s a desperate earnestness about its quest for both spiritual meaning and old-fashioned romance, its determination to be \u201cthe kind of movie they don\u2019t make anymore,\u201d although in this case nobody ever did. Goldsman, a longtime screenwriter and producer who won an Oscar in 2002 for the screenplay to \u201cA Beautiful Mind,\u201d has evidently been trying to get this picture made for years, and has said that a personal loss in his own life drove him to pursue it even more fervently. (Wikipedia informs me that Goldsman\u2019s wife died unexpectedly in 2010.) I\u2019ve never read Helprin\u2019s novel, which runs almost 700 pages, but it\u2019s clear from reading a plot synopsis that Goldsman has pushed the adaptation pretty far in his own direction. What we see here is an unstable concoction that feels like \u201cCloud Atlas\u201d mixed with \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables,\u201d as re-imagined by Dan Brown (indeed, Goldsman wrote the screenplays for both \u201cThe Da Vinci Code\u201d and \u201cAngels & Demons\u201d).", "article_metadata": {"description": "Colin Farrell rides a flying horse and outwits Satan in the goofball New Age religious fable \"Winter's Tale\"", "author": "Andrew O'Hehir", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Colin Farrell rides a flying horse and outwits Satan in the goofball New Age religious fable \"Winter's Tale\"", "title": "\u201cWinter\u2019s Tale\u201d and America\u2019s tortured quest for the divine", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/02/15/winters_tale_and_americas_tortured_quest_for_the_divine/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/winters_tale2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Colin Farrell rides a flying horse and outwits Satan in the goofball New Age religious fable \"Winter's Tale\"", "creator": "@andohehir", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/winters_tale2.jpg", "title": "\u201cWinter\u2019s Tale\u201d and America\u2019s tortured quest for the divine", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "\u201cWinter\u2019s Tale\u201d and America\u2019s tortured quest for the divine", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Akiva Goldsman, Christianity, Colin Farrell, Downton Abbey, Editor's Picks, jessica brown findlay, Movies, New Age, Religion, Russell Crowe, Winter'sTale", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5e8b\"", "article_summary": "Clumsy and kitschy as \u201cWinter\u2019s Tale\u201d often is, there\u2019s no denying that it feels like a profoundly and perhaps painfully personal film, in a way Hollywood movies almost never do.\nAll these movies, and others to come, are landing in a climate when the discussion about the role of religion in American life is both heated and intensely confused.\nThen we have the accusatory debates between the so-called New Atheists and their opponents (a long-running feature of this publication!\nI found Goldsman\u2019s adaptation of the 1983 bestseller by Mark Helprin both attractive and repulsive, sometimes at the same moment.\nWe argue about whether or not the United States is in some sense a \u201cChristian nation,\u201d and to be frank, both sides have a point."}
