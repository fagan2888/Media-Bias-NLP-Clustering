Drew Snider scored off a feed from Justin Pennington in the final minute, and the Denver Outlaws completed a rally from a four-goal deficit in the first quarter to defeat the Rochester Rattlers 12-11 and win the Major League Lacrosse championship Saturday night at Fifth Third Bank Stadium in Kennesaw, Ga.

John Grant Jr. had four points on a hat trick and an assist to lead the Outlaws to their first Steinfeld Cup trophy in five tries, including a loss to Rochester in 2008, when Outlaws coach B.J. O’Hara was coaching the Rattlers.

Chris Bocklet and former University of Denver Pioneers standout Eric Law had two goals for Denver, which got on the scoreboard first with an unassisted goal from Bocklet, then surrendered five straight tallies to Rochester and trailed 5-1 at the end of the first period.

Denver tightened its defense in the second quarter, allowing only one goal while getting scores from Domenic Sebatiani, Grant and a power-play goal from Bocklet, assisted by Law, to trail 6-4 at halftime.

Rochester scored the first two goals after the break, while Law and Jeremy Sieverts scored unassisted goals for Denver. Still, the Outlaws were outscored 4-2 in the third and trailed 10-6 entering the final quarter.

Grant scored two unassisted goals and assisted on a score by Law as the Outlaws drew within one, then, after a Rattlers’ score, Sieverts scored an unassisted two-pointer to tie the game, setting up Snider and Pennington’s heroics.

It was Denver’s fifth MLL Championship appearance in nine years as a franchise. The Outlaws are the only MLL franchise to make the playoffs in each year of existence.
