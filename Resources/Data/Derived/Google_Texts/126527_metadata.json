Ted Cruz is ending his presidential campaign, eliminating the biggest impediment to Donald Trump's march to the Republican nomination.\n\nCruz's campaign said he plans to drop out of the race Tuesday following his loss in Indiana's Republican primary to Trump.\n\nCruz's campaign placed its hopes on a data-driven effort to turn out conservative evangelical Christians who had opted out of recent presidential elections. Increasingly, he would modify his travel schedule to go where data showed there might be pockets of untapped supporters.\n\nThe Republican presidential nominee hopefuls are battling it out for Indiana, in a primary that could have a lasting impact on the race to the nomination.\n\nThe leading GOP candidates are aware that there is a lot on the line in Indiana.\n\n\"Indiana is very important because if I win, that's the end of it,\" Donald Trump said during a rally in the state.\n\nMeanwhile Ohio Gov. John Kasich backed out of campaigning in Indiana ahead of the primary as part of a collaborative strategy with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz to deprive Donald Trump the delegates needed to win the Republican nomination. Kasich's campaign said it would give Cruz a \"clear path\" in Indiana.\n\nTrump is entering the Indiana primary after a clean sweep during the April 26 primary election in Maryland, Delaware, Pennsylvania, Connecticut and Rhode Island. His victories there bring him to 956 delegates out of the 1,237 needed for the nomination ahead of Indiana's Primary. Cruz stands at 546 delegates ahead of Indiana's primary.\n\nAhead of the Indiana Primary both Cruz and Trump made visits to Indiana. Cruz visited South Bend April 28 with his newly announced VP pick Carly Fiorina. During his visit, Cruz made a variety of promises including repealing Obamacare, abolishing the IRS and stopping welfare for illegal immigrants.\n\n\"We're going to see Carrier bringing their jobs back to Indiana, we're going to see manufacturing jobs coming back to Indiana.\" Cruz said.\n\nDonald Trump visited South Bend Monday. During his visit, Trump talked about repealing Obamacare, building a wall, taking care of veterans and protecting the 2nd Amendment.\n\n57 Republican delegaes are at stake in Indiana.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "UPDATE: AP\u00a0 Texas Sen.
