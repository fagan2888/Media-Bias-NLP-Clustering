House Republicans will keep their focus on opioid legislation in the weekly Republican address this weekend.

Rep. Bob Dold (R-Ill.) will discuss what lawmakers are doing to address the opioid epidemic in Saturday’s address. House Republicans are planning to advance legislation related to opioid abuse treatment and prevention over the next two months.

“As a co-chair of the Suburban Anti-Heroin Task Force in Illinois, I’ve seen firsthand the unimaginable suffering that heroin has brought onto families in our community and around the country,” Dold said in a statement. “Heroin doesn’t discriminate by demographics, zip code, or partisanship, which is why we can’t let politics get in the way of helping people in our communities who are struggling with addiction find the treatment they need to get their lives back on track.”

Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said yesterday that committees should finish their work this month, and the House could vote on such measures in May.

The Senate passed the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act last month. Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), who co-wrote the bill, said yesterday the House should move more quickly on opioid legislation.
