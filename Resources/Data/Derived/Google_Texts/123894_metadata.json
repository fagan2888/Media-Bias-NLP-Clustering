The Kurdish regional government in northern Iraq released a video Sunday, Oct. 25, 2015 purportedly showing the joint raid of a prison by U.S. and Kurdish peshmerga forces in which they released 70 hostages from the Islamic State group\u2019s captivity. (Kurdistan Regional Security Council via AP) The Associated Press\n\nBy BRAM JANSSEN, Associated Press\n\nIRBIL, Iraq (AP) \u2014 The Kurdish regional government in northern Iraq released a video Sunday purportedly showing the joint raid of a prison by U.S. and Kurdish peshmerga forces in which they released 70 hostages held by the Islamic State group.\n\nThe helmet camera footage allegedly shows the Thursday raid of the prison which was controlled by Islamic State militants in the town of Huwija, 15 kilometers (9 miles) west of the Iraqi city of Kirkuk.\n\nA line of panicked men in traditional ankle-length garments are seen running past the camera, some with their hands up, as Arabic-speaking men scream at them, \"Let's go! Let's go!\" Gunfire rings out non-stop in the background. The soldiers as seen walking through a dark room with the Islamic State group's trademark black flag draped on the wall. The rescued hostages are then frisked for weapons and led away.\n\nOfficials later said about 20 of the rescued hostages were members of Iraqi security forces.\n\nArmy Master Sgt. Joshua L. Wheeler, 39, of Roland, Oklahoma, was killed during the raid, officials said. He was the first American to die in combat since the U.S. launched Operation Inherent Resolve last year.\n\nThe raid marked the first time US troops were involved in direct ground combat in Iraq since the war against the Islamic State group was launched in August 2014.\n\nU.S. officials said the plan for the rescue mission had called for the U.S. troops, who are members of the elite and secretive Delta Force, to stay back from the prison compound and let the Kurds do the fighting. The Americans transported the Kurds to the scene aboard five U.S. helicopters. However, the U.S. troops were drawn into the fight to help the Kurdish soldiers.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "world/articles", "keyword": "Associated Press", "title": "New video purportedly shows US-Kurdish raid against IS group", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "IRBIL, Iraq (AP) \u2014 The Kurdish regional government in northern Iraq has released a video purportedly showing a raid on a prison by U.S. and Kurdish peshmerga forces that freed 70 hostages held by the Islamic State group.", "title": "Iraqi Kurds release purported video of raid with US commandos against the Islamic State group", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2015/10/25/new-video-purportedly-shows-us-kurdish-raid-against-is-group", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/4c/213f24112d57ce5d10b744057db633/media:2101d500297f47e788cde538a2faa1f1MideastIraqRaidVideo.JPEG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "IRBIL, Iraq (AP) \u2014 The Kurdish regional government in northern Iraq has released a video purportedly showing a raid on a prison by U.S. and Kurdish peshmerga forces that freed 70 hostages held by the Islamic State group.", "site": "@USNews", "card": "summary", "title": "New video purportedly shows US-Kurdish raid against IS group"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "news", "date_published": "Oct. 25, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Collections: World,Collections: Top News,Associated Press", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "IRBIL, Iraq (AP) \u2014 The Kurdish regional government in northern Iraq has released a video purportedly showing a raid on a prison by U.S. and Kurdish peshmerga forces that freed 70 hostages held by the Islamic State group."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd400d\"", "article_summary": "The soldiers as seen walking through a dark room with the Islamic State group's trademark black flag draped on the wall.\nThe raid marked the first time US troops were involved in direct ground combat in Iraq since the war against the Islamic State group was launched in August 2014.\nThe Kurdish regional government in northern Iraq released a video Sunday, Oct. 25, 2015 purportedly showing the joint raid of a prison by U.S. and Kurdish peshmerga forces in which they released 70 hostages from the Islamic State group\u2019s captivity.\nThe helmet camera footage allegedly shows the Thursday raid of the prison which was controlled by Islamic State militants in the town of Huwija, 15 kilometers (9 miles) west of the Iraqi city of Kirkuk.\n(Kurdistan Regional Security Council via AP) The Associated PressBy BRAM JANSSEN, Associated PressIRBIL, Iraq (AP) \u2014 The Kurdish regional government in northern Iraq released a video Sunday purportedly showing the joint raid of a prison by U.S. and Kurdish peshmerga forces in which they released 70 hostages held by the Islamic State group."}
