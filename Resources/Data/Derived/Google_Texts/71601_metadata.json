But in Lebanon, New Hampshire, contact with the healthcare system is far lower \u2013 just 10 days on average.\n\nNew Yorkers probably are not that much sicker than their New England neighbors. Instead, the statistic reflects the wide variation in the way healthcare is delivered to older adults around the United States.\n\nThe Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice recently issued a report card on how the United States provides healthcare to seniors by region. Using Medicare enrollment and claims data from 2012, the report compares regions on such factors as where seniors spend the most time with doctors, where they are most likely to be hospitalized, or be subjected to unnecessary tests or risky medications.\n\n\n\nThe report also points to ways seniors \u2013 or children helping to care for elderly parents \u2013 can navigate the healthcare system to receive better care. The research is being used to discover whether best practices are being used \u2013 and where. The answers vary widely across the country.\n\nConsider the following high and low measurements:\n\n* In York, Pennsylvania, 73.4% of seniors had a primary care physician as their predominant healthcare provider who coordinated all their care, compared with just 42.6% in Metairie, Louisiana. The national average was 56.9%.\n\nResearch has shown that regions with a greater proportion of care provided by primary care physicians tended to have lower costs, higher quality, and lower rates of avoidable hospitalizations.\n\n* In Clearwater, Florida, 26.1% of seniors had an annual wellness checkup, compared with just 1.2% in Meridian, Mississippi. Under the Affordable Care Act, all Medicare enrollees are entitled to a free annual preventive check-up, which includes personalized prevention planning, an assessment of a patient\u2019s functional ability and a review of a person\u2019s risk factors for depression.\n\nNationally, just 10.7% of Medicare beneficiaries took advantage of the wellness visit in 2012 \u2013 a number that should be far higher.\n\n* In Fort Lauderdale, Florida, patients saw an average of 4.7 clinicians in 2012, compared with just 2.4 in Bangor, Maine (the national average was 3.4). Here, less is more \u2013 it is a measure of the complexity and fragmentation of care a beneficiary is receiving. More providers translates into greater rates of overuse and misuse of care, duplication of services and higher risk of communication-related risks and errors, according to the report.\n\n* 30% of male seniors over age 75 in Miami were screened for prostate cancer, despite a 2008 recommendation by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force that the test not be done on men above that age. In Casper, Wyoming, the rate is 9.9% (U.S. average: 19.5%.)\n\nCurrent best-practice thinking is that benefits of the screening do not outweigh the harms, including patient worry about false-positive results, invasive follow-up tests and treatment with side effects.\n\n* The practice of placing a feeding tube in patients with advanced dementia has been widely discredited as not prolonging life or improving outcomes, yet it happened in 14.2% of cases in Lake Charles, Louisiana, in 2012. In Portland, Oregon, just 1.3% of patients received a feeding tube, and the national average was 6%.\n\nThe wide variation in these numbers points to a need for more coordination of care through primary care physicians with expertise caring for elderly patients, said Dr. Julie P.W. Bynum, associate professor at the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth College and the report\u2019s lead author.\n\n\u201cAs you age, you have lots of different medical problems competing against one another,\u201d she said. \u201cHaving someone who can coordinate all the different doctors is important. If you have two or three diseases, you want the whole person treated.\u201d\n\nIf you are not sure your doctor is playing that role, Bynum recommends that you ask her a simple question: \u201cAre you the doctor to whom I should have all my records sent? Do all the records come to your office?\u201d\n\nBynum also urges patients and their families to assert themselves more when it comes to healthcare decision-making. And if you feel like healthcare is eating up too much of your time, ask your doctor is there is a way to schedule things more efficiently, she adds. \u201cCan you get your lab tests done one day a year instead of six?\u201d\n\nFinally, Bynum offers a reminder about annual wellness checkups. \u201cIt\u2019s a new benefit \u2013 so it\u2019s important to know that you can ask for it.\u201d\n\nResources\n\nFor information on the healthcare system\u2019s performance where you live, visit this interactive map produced by the Dartmouth Institute.
