But what if everybody\u2019s wrong? That\u2019s the contention of \u201cOn Inequality,\u201d a small, smart new volume by Princeton University philosopher Harry Frankfurt.\n\nHis simple but powerful thesis: \u201cOur most fundamental challenge is not the fact that the incomes of Americans are widely unequal. It is, rather, the fact that too many of our people are poor.\u201d\n\nProgressives, in other words, are shooting at the wrong target. The moral problem posed by the distribution of wealth isn\u2019t inequality.\n\nIt\u2019s poverty.\n\nThe same issue? Frankfurt shows they\u2019re not. Suppose, he says, there is a resource that will keep a person alive, but only if that person has five units of it. There are 10 people, and 40 units of the resource. If it\u2019s distributed equally, everybody gets four units \u2014 and dies. To insist on equality in that case, he argues, \u201cwould be morally grotesque.\u201d\n\nFortunately, says Frankfurt, we don\u2019t really try to promote equality. Even those who worry about inequality adjust their consumption to their own assessments of their needs. They don\u2019t reduce their consumption because it\u2019s unfair for them to have money.\n\nThis instinct he lauds: \u201cA preoccupation with the condition of others . . . leads a person away from understanding what he himself truly requires in order effectively to pursue his own most authentic needs, interests, and ambitions.\u201d\n\nFrankfurt suggests that the instinct that leads many to complain about inequality isn\u2019t about equality at all: Their objection \u201cis not that some of the individuals in those circumstances have less money than others. Rather, it is the fact that those with less have too little.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s on strong ground here. There is a tendency on the left to think of inequality principally as a problem of the rich having too much. Frankfurt contends that this worry is a distraction from the far more important goal of making sure everyone has enough.\n\nMy progressive friends who bemoan inequality usually define the problem not as the poor having too little but as the rich having too much. I was raised to the liberalism of the 1960s, when assisting those worst off was first priority.\n\nThink the problems are the same? Just glance at the income curve and cut off the very tip of the right tail \u2014 that is, eliminate the superrich. The shape of the curve doesn\u2019t change. The poor are just as poor as they were before.\n\nOne reason for the obsession with curbing the power of wealth is a concern that the rich can buy more political influence than they deserve. My worry is that what\u2019s really going on isn\u2019t a struggle over the outsize influence of the very rich, but a struggle over who should exercise outsize influence.\n\nAfter all, the beneficiaries of a taming of the influence of the rich would be not the poor and downtrodden but the educated professional classes who have long dominated the academy and the news media.\n\nFrankfurt warns us not to measure our circumstances against those of others: \u201cIf a person has enough resources to provide for the satisfaction of his needs and interests, his resources are then entirely adequate; their adequacy does not depend in addition on the magnitude of the resources other people possess.\u201d\n\nWhat people deserve equally, Frankfurt contends, is not equality in money but equality in respect. This might require making sure that everyone has a particular amount of a particular good, but it doesn\u2019t require making sure that everyone has the same amount of that good.\n\nAn example is health care. We might agree everyone has the right to a particular standard of care without decreeing that everyone must be able to buy what the rich can. Frankfurt presumably would come down in the first camp: that you can buy more health care than I is morally irrelevant as long as I can buy enough.\n\nBefore you cringe in horror, bear in mind that the Affordable Care Act is structured exactly on this model, and that even Sen. Bernie Sanders, in Tuesday\u2019s debate, referred to people\u2019s right to \u201cthe health care that they need\u201d \u2014 not the health care that they want.\n\nFrankfurt\u2019s short book (89 pages) should be required reading for candidates of both parties, if only to get them to focus on his central point: For all our fine talk about inequality, what\u2019s truly terrible in America is not that so few have so much. It\u2019s that so many have so little.\n\n\u00a9 2015, Bloomberg News", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "New York Post", "twitter": {"description": "Most of the talk generated by Tuesday\u2019s Democratic debate is about e-mails or enemies, but far more important were the efforts of the presidential candidates to explain what they would do about", "title": "How the war on inequality ignores the poor", "image": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/sowell.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=664&h=441&crop=1", "creator": "@nypost", "site": "@nypost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"post_id\":\"nypost-9899737\"}", "sailthru.tags": "healthcare,income-inequality,poverty,", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://nypost.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/0b14d9dbf0c711522a906102b60f3da0?s=16", "generator": "WordPress.com", "sailthru.date": "2015-10-17 05:05:14", "sailthru.title": "How the war on inequality ignores the\u00a0poor", "nypost-section": "Opinion", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/sowell.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=231&h=154&crop=1", "description": "Most of the talk generated by Tuesday\u2019s Democratic debate is about e-mails or enemies, but far more important were the efforts of the presidential candidates to explain what they would do about achieving another e-word: equality. \r\n\r\nAnd when they spoke of inequality, it was clear that their concern was the accumulation of wealth and power by the very wealthy.\r\n\r\nInequality is on everybody\u2019s lips these days.
