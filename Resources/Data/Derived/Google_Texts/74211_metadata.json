In the ensuing months, at least 40 conversations were held around the city.\n\nFour themes surfaced time and again, according to Hancock: the importance of youth voices, a desire for increased engagement between police officers and community members, the need for improved education about the judicial process and recognition of the community\u2019s accountability in effecting change.\n\n\u201cThis is not just about police officers,\u201d Hancock said. \u201cThere is a part here for the community to recognize they have a role in building these relationships.\u201d\n\nKeynote speaker Ryan Ross, dean of student development at the Community College of Denver, also focused on the community\u2019s role.\n\n\u201cToday, if we make it so, Denver can be a role model or a beacon for other cities,\u201d Ross said. \u201cNow is the time, not because it\u2019s what\u2019s trending on social media but simply because it\u2019s the right thing to do at the right time in our city. Today, we have a special opportunity to embrace these conversations and take this movement to the next level.\u201d\n\nFollowing the addresses, Denver police officers led the audience through role-playing situations where young people were asked to handle common law enforcement scenarios.\n\n\u201cWe want people to understand the role of law enforcement officers,\u201d explained Officer Alan Ha. \u201cAt the same time, we as public servants want to know what the public is thinking. This was very honest two-way communication.\u201d\n\nRoughly 100 people attended, including students. Kalina Gallardo, 17, said she had hoped more young people would participate but was pleased with the summit overall.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been really eye-opening, very educational,\u201d Gallardo said. \u201cIt\u2019s really starting to create this family relationship. We can start to appreciate each other and really find what it means to be good to one another.\u201d\n\nA series of eight community forums will be in Denver throughout the summer to build off Saturday\u2019s summit.\n\nAnna Gauldin: 303-954-1666, agauldin@denverpost.com", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Hancock pushes for racial equity, justice at community summit", "title": "Hancock pushes for racial equity, justice at community summit", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/04/25/hancock-pushes-for-racial-equity-justice-at-community-summit/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150425__hancock1p1.jpg", "height": 416}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150425__hancock1p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-25T15:42:32+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-25T04:30:49+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "After months of conversations about race and justice, Mayor Michael Hancock has identified four key areas to address as Denver pushes for equality.\n\u201cThis is not just about police officers,\u201d Hancock said.\n\u201cI think we\u2019ll walk away from this experience a better city because of it,\u201d Hancock said Saturday at the Race and Justice Community/Youth Summit at the History Colorado Center.\n\u201cWe\u2019re pouring a lot into these conversations; a lot has been said.\u201dThe discussions began in December, when Hancock challenged the community to engage in the topics of race and justice.\n\u201cToday, if we make it so, Denver can be a role model or a beacon for other cities,\u201d Ross said."}
