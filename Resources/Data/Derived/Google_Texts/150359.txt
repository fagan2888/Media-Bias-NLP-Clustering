All of the announced Republican U.S. Senate candidates visited the Polk County GOP convention in Ankeny on Saturday to try to win over the delegates from the state’s largest county. Each candidate was given five minutes to deliver their stump speech.

Here is a look at each candidate’s performance:

Joni Ernst

Many observers stated that Joni Ernst gave the best speech of the bunch. Her delivery was much more fiery than usual. The state senator from Red Oak focused much of her attention on the Democrat nominee-to-be, Bruce Braley. The speech got better as it went on.

“I see Bruce Braley and this administration try to replace our Iowa values with Washington, D.C. values and that is absolutely unacceptable,” Ernst said to big applause from the delegates. “When I go to the United States Senate, I am going to take our Iowa values with me to Washington, D.C. We are not going to allow Bruce Braley to occupy that seat and I am the Republican candidate that will beat Bruce Braley in November.
