Most still die in costly medical facilities tethered to machines, often unable to communicate, in a futile attempt to prolong their lives.\n\nDr. Angelo E. Volandes, the author of an enlightening new book, \u201cThe Conversation,\u201d said that although Americans received some of the best health care money could buy, \u201cthey also experience some of the worst deaths in the developed world,\u201d mainly because people failed to articulate what they wished for at the end of life, and doctors failed \u201cto recognize that fixing specific problems may not fix the whole patient.\u201d\n\nDivinigracia\u2019s experience is illustrative.\n\nAt 88 and in need of full-time care after 10 years with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, she developed acute kidney failure. Her doctor suggested dialysis.\n\nBut after a clearheaded review of her prospects, her devoted husband and primary caregiver, Paul, and their son and daughter acknowledged that, had she been able to say so, she would not have chosen aggressive medical treatment that would only further diminish the quality of her remaining days.\n\nAnd so she lived to have an 89th birthday celebration with her family before deteriorating health prompted a call to hospice for help.\n\nBy now, most people are aware of advance directives \u2014 living wills that detail the treatments wanted or not wanted when life hangs in the balance, and assignment of health care agents to speak for patients when they cannot speak for themselves. But as of 2010, only 26.3 percent of American adults had prepared such a document, according to a nationally representative survey of 7,946 participants.\n\nEven those who have done so don\u2019t necessarily understand what they have signed up for, nor have they discussed these matters with their doctors and had the document included in their health record.\n\n\u201cAn advance directive is just a piece of paper \u2014 that\u2019s not enough,\u201d said Dr. Joan M. Teno, a health policy expert at Brown University School of Public Health. \u201cThe doctor or nurse practitioner should talk with the patient and family about the goals of care and the patient\u2019s wishes and preferences, then put a plan of care in place to insure that those preferences will be honored.\u201d\n\nDoctors should be sure patients understand their prognosis, and should anticipate the problems likely to arise and \u201chave the right medications and services in place\u201d so patients nearing the end of life are not automatically shipped off to an intensive care unit and placed on ventilators, feeding tubes or dialysis, Teno said.\n\nAs Dr. Atul Gawande put it in his new book, \u201cBeing Mortal,\u201d \u201cWe pay doctors to give chemotherapy and to do surgery but not to take the time required to sort out when to do so is unwise.\u201d\n\nVolandes, a staff physician at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, noted that \u201cin the abstract, fighting every second of the way and pursuing aggressive life-prolonging interventions sounds admirable.\u201d But he wants doctors, patients and families to consider the likely outcome of the fight and how much suffering it will involve.\n\nHe recognizes that \u201cthere are no right and wrong decisions about medical care at the end of life\u201d but insists that all decisions should be fully informed. To ensure that patients and families understand the options, he has developed a video tour of what medical interventions like ventilation, CPR or placement of a feeding tube look like, which often prompts a change of heart.\n\nAs one patient put it, \u201cIt looks so different on television.\u201d\n\nThe video, produced by ACP Decisions, a nonprofit group devoted to advanced-care planning, is licensed to health care providers and insurers who can show it to patients and families to facilitate shared decision making in planning for care at the end of life.\n\nIn a randomized trial of the video\u2019s effectiveness among 50 patients with advanced brain cancer, a quarter of patients in the control group who had only a verbal discussion about end-of-life care with their doctors chose life-prolonging care, half opted for limited medical care and only one-quarter chose comfort care.\n\nBut none of those who saw the video opted for life-prolonging care, a handful chose limited medical care, and 92 percent decided on comfort care, Volandes reported. After watching the video, patients said they had a better understanding of their choices.\n\nHowever, even just a discussion with their doctors about goals for end-of-life care can often make a huge difference. The one-third of patients in a 2008 national Coping With Cancer study who had such a discussion were less likely to undergo CPR, be put on a ventilator or be placed in an intensive care unit. Most enrolled in hospice, suffered less and were in better physical shape and better able to interact with others and for a longer time.\n\nTheir survivors, too, fared better; six months after the deaths, they were markedly less likely to experience major depression.\n\nOptions regarding end-of-life care should be discussed well before an emergency \u2014 or for those with dementia, during the early stages of mental decline.\n\n\u201cThe absolute worst time to contemplate decisions about medical care is when one is critically ill and in the hospital,\u201d Volandes writes.\n\nThe kinds of questions doctors should be asking:\n\n\u25a0 What gives your life meaning and joy?\n\n\u25a0 What are your biggest fears and concerns?\n\n\u25a0 What are you looking forward to?\n\n\u25a0 What goals are most important to you now?\n\n\u25a0 What trade-offs or sacrifices are you willing to make to achieve those goals?\n\nWhoever is chosen as health care agent must understand the patient\u2019s priorities and agree to honor them, regardless of what that person might want for himself.\n\nA strong backbone is needed to assure that the agent will advocate the patient\u2019s wishes even if doctors or family members disagree.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2015/02/hfbrody17.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3a66\"", "article_summary": "After watching the video, patients said they had a better understanding of their choices.\n\u201cThe absolute worst time to contemplate decisions about medical care is when one is critically ill and in the hospital,\u201d Volandes writes.\nHe recognizes that \u201cthere are no right and wrong decisions about medical care at the end of life\u201d but insists that all decisions should be fully informed.\nWhoever is chosen as health care agent must understand the patient\u2019s priorities and agree to honor them, regardless of what that person might want for himself.\nBut none of those who saw the video opted for life-prolonging care, a handful chose limited medical care, and 92 percent decided on comfort care, Volandes reported."}
