A 63-year-old man recently died after being injured in a bike and car collision, so cyclists held a bike memorial to honor him.\n\nBikers held a moment of silence, remembering avid cyclist Dale Kimpton. They said they want to make sure other cyclists don\u2019t suffer his same fate.\n\nJohn Shelso said he knows how dangerous some roads can be and tries to steer clear of busy streets.\n\n\"Then if you\u2019re on a really busy street like 41st street and Minnesota, you're almost asking for trouble because they don't want to slow down for a bicyclist,\" Shelso said.\n\nBiker Jonathan Larson's wife was hit by a car while cycling. He said road conditions should be better for bikers and drivers.\n\n\n\n\"I believe we really need to come together as a community, both drivers and bicyclists, to just understand that each of us do belong here,\" Larson said.\n\nCyclists started their commute at Dunham Park. Then they made their way up 41st street from Shirley Avenue.\n\nThey stopped at the gas station near Empire Mall to take a moment of silence.\n\nThe accident happened right on 41st street. Bikers placed a white painted ghost bike in memory of the biker that passed.\n\nCyclist said there's no reason why they can't safely ride alongside drivers. Falls Area Bicyclists say everyone should be able to share the road safely.\n\n\"There are a lot of different types of people that use the road. People driving cars, people riding bicycles, and there is a way for all of us to coexist and share the road, and hopefully this sends a message, that here's the right way to do it,\u201d Chris Parsley, FAB President, said.\n\nBicyclists said whether you\u2019re riding a bicycle, driving a car, or using your legs, you should be able to do it safely.\n\nFAB officials said bikers should never ride against traffic flow. They should always be riding in the right direction where drivers can see them.\n\nGeneral {{Title}} Remove Change News General Courts Web Only Crime Outdoors Events Center Non-Homepage Boredom Busters Pipeline Positively KELOLAND Technology Hunger Affordable Care Act Shops Flooding Remembering 9/11 Drought JazzFest Spring Storm Honor Flight Spencer Anniversary\n\nDoApp Health News Business News Sports\n\nAgriculture Markets Livestock Crops Politics\n\nHealthBeat Cancer Children's Health Heart Health Wellness & Nutrition General Health Beat Women's Health RX Resources What's Going Around OTC Diabetes Recalls Dental Health Men's Health\n\nPolitics South Dakota Legislature Budget Congress Taxes General Local Campaign President US Senate New Laws US House Iowa Ballot Issues Local Races Minnesota Gubernatorial\n\nEducation Funding College Elementary High School Pre K School Supplies Middle School\n\nSports Professional College High School Sports Zone Headlines Summit League Tournament Olympics\n\nBusiness Industry Your Money Matters Development Gas & Energy Legislation Economy/Stocks Employment General Health Care Technology Education Funding Tourism Banking/Finance Housing Transportation Insurance Meetings & Events Retail & Restaurants All Industries On The Move Shops Agriculture\n\nFeatured Stories Eye on KELOLAND Inside KELOLAND\n\nWeather Snow Forecast Records Rain Flooding Drought WX Corner General\n\nWorld News\n\nInvestigates GEAR UP\n\nSponsored Done\n\n\u00a9 2016 KELOLAND TV.
