If you’ve been unsuccessful in creating a healthcare.gov account, you’re in the majority, according to The Hill.

Federal officials claim more than 8 million people have gone to the website to look for insurance coverage. However, only one in 10 people apparently have been successful in creating an account.

I still am not one of those successes.

Healthcare.gov is the federal website where residents of 36 states, including Texas, must go to buy insurance. Leaders of those states refused to create state-operated insurance marketplaces.

More than 2.5 million Texans, families and individuals, are expected to be eligible to sign up for the nation’s largest expansion of coverage in 50 years. Nationally, the administration hopes to enroll 7 million consumers in the first year.

On Saturday, Be Covered Texas, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas’ statewide education and outreach campaign, will hold a health services and health care information fair 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. at Reliant Center.

The fair is for those looking for information about the health care law, healthy food giveaways, community resources and free services, including flu shots and health screenings.

Free parking will be available with an event flyer or parking voucher that can be downloaded at BeCoveredTexas.org.
