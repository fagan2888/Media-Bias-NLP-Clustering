It's part of the federal Affordable Care Act. States can decide whether or not to opt in.\n\n\n\n\"Give people the options they want to live out in the community and be a part of their community instead of being stuck away in a nursing home,\" said Brenda Stinebuck with ADAPT's Arkansas chapter.\n\n\n\nIn an act of civil disobedience, 36 protesters were arrested after refusing to follow police orders to leave the building.\n\n\n\n\"They were given the option to leave or be arrested and charged for criminal trespass,\" said Sgt. Cassandra Davis with the Little Rock Police Department.\n\n\n\nAfter being loaded up on those city buses, demonstrators were taken to another location where they were issued trespassing citations and then released. Police say they were not taken to jail.\n\n\n\nKARK 4 News tried getting in contact with the Arkansas Healthcare Association to get its take on the protest, but a phone call and email have not been returned .\n\n\n\nCopyright 2016 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc.
