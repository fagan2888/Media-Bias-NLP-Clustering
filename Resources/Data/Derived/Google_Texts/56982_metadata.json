A lifetime of taunts and discrimination taught her that it probably would be easier hiding the truth about her health.\n\nBut Gibson doesn't want to hide. She wants to fight.\n\n\"We need to change the way we talk about HIV,\" Gibson says. \"With my story, I would like to show the world how far we have come in education and medical treatment. I would like to show people that HIV is not the threat we once thought it was.\"\n\nAs an HIV care specialist with Mobile Mental Health Support Services, 24-year-old Gibson can educate the community about the virus using her life as an example. She hopes to reduce the stigma of HIV and help patients find a more normal life.\n\nGibson was born with HIV, passed along by her mother who at the time was unaware she had the virus. Gibson wasn't diagnosed until she was 2 years old, after her mother received the same diagnosis.\n\n\u201cThe whole thing changed our family dynamic,\u201d Gibson says. \u201cMy mother and I were positive while my dad and brother were negative. We were once a happy family, and that all changed.\u201d\n\nHer mother was given only six months to live but fought for several years, dying when Gibson was 4.\n\nAll the while, Gibson was never shy about who she was. As a result, she faced hatred and discrimination growing up in California.\n\n\u201cI grew up knowing I had HIV and couldn\u2019t keep my mouth shut about it,\u201d she says. \u201cI didn\u2019t know I needed to.\u201d\n\nOn the best days when she was in elementary and middle school, Gibson would sit isolated from her classmates with her long hair draped over her face to shield herself from the taunts. On the worst days, classmates would throw paper wads and pennies to pick on her.\n\n\u201cSomehow the teachers always missed this,\u201d she says.\n\nGibson was pegged incorrectly as the girl with AIDS. Whenever she felt ill or had a nosebleed, school officials didn\u2019t know how to handle Gibson and would just send her home.\n\n\"A kid wrote 'Lexi has AIDS' on the science door in seventh grade,\" she says.\n\nLife was complicated at home, too.\n\n\u201cI was an obnoxious child, but it was because I was hurting and confused,\u201d she says. \u201cMy dad was heartbroken and honestly doing the best he could. I understand that now.\u201d\n\nShe began to refuse to take her medications.\n\n\u201cThe medications had hard side effects as your body gets used to them,\u201d Gibson says. \u201cI would always throw them up.\u201d\n\nOne day, after another altercation with a family member at home, her father dropped her off at a group home.\n\n\u201cAnd he never came back to pick me up,\u201d she says.\n\nGibson didn't stay long at the group home, instead bouncing back and forth among friends' houses. After about a month at the first group home, her older sister asked Gibson to stay with her in San Francisco.\n\n\u201cShe told me, \u2018I think all you really just need is love,\u2019 \u201d Gibson says.\n\nThis arrangement also fell through and the effects of not taking the medications became more severe.\n\n\u201cI ended up at a children\u2019s hospital,\u201d she says. \u201cMy body was shutting down. At that point, I was on the verge of AIDS.\u201d\n\nGibson needed a reliable place to go, and ended up with her sister's boss, who persuaded her to stick with her medicine. But Gibson was still dealing with emotional trauma from her past that made the next three years difficult.\n\n\u201cShe tried to nurture me and mend me,\u201d she says.\n\nBut Gibson says she took to the streets, getting involved with sex, drugs and alcohol. She was sent to live with an aunt on the East Coast for a month.\n\nDuring the interim, her guardian arranged for her to go to a group home called Solstice RTC in Salt Lake City. She was 17 and stayed in the program for a year. Her counselors helped her work through past trauma and better formulate a life plan.\n\nAfter she finished the program, she went on to Snow College in Utah.\n\nTaking time off from college, Gibson made her way to Las Vegas two years ago.\n\nShe recently finished her degree in human services from the University of Phoenix. During her time there, she took a class taught by Tanitsha Bridgers, CEO of Mobile Mental Health Support Services.\n\n\"She did a presentation on HIV and just blew me away,\" Bridgers says.\n\nAfter the class, Bridgers and Gibson reconnected.\n\n\"She needed to do an internship for her degree,\" Bridgers adds.\n\nMobile Mental Health provides services for all types of people who suffer from depression, anxiety or other problems. Having Gibson as an advocate, the company has expanded its outreach to help those with HIV.\n\n\"I think her transparency and willingness to talk about the disease is going to help reach a population that typically stays isolated,\" Bridgers says.\n\nGibson says helping others with the virus was something her mother would have been proud of. While looking at family memorabilia, Gibson discovered that her mother had been active raising awareness about living with HIV, including a newspaper article.\n\nGibson also appeared in a collection of books and articles throughout her life from authors and photographers who followed children living with the disease.\n\nLike her mother, she hopes to be bold in sharing her story as an HIV and AIDS care specialist.\n\n\"She is a rock star and very tenacious,\" Bridgers says. \"She is going to do great.\"\n\nIn her new role, she will work directly with those newly infected with HIV. Gibson works with clients at any point in coping with HIV in her role as HIV care specialist.\n\n\u201cWhen someone tests positive, they feel like they\u2019ve lost control of their life,\u201d Gibson says. \u201cBut we help them regain control of their life. This disease doesn\u2019t change who you are.\u201d\n\nGibson\u2019s dream is to open a mental health center specifically for those with HIV that has support groups, education and even job resources.\n\nBut helping clients is just part of what she is doing. Gibson wants to eliminate the stigma associated with HIV.\n\nDr. Rosanne Sugay, an HIV specialist with the Southern Nevada Health District, says HIV isn\u2019t what it used to be.\n\n\u201cIt is amazing in the past 30 years we went from not knowing what the disease was to having medications that control it,\u201d Sugay says. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a cure, but we have gotten pretty good at controlling it with one pill a day.\u201d\n\nMedications today help to keep the virus undetectable, which means the virus is so low in a person\u2019s body it doesn\u2019t register on certain tests.\n\nWhen a person is newly infected, many doctors, under the advice of the Centers for Disease Control, recommend getting on medications to achieve undetectable status.\n\nWhen a person is undetectable, Sugay says, there is a pretty low chance of spreading the virus.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not zero (percent) but it\u2019s very low,\u201d she says.\n\nGibson says the medication has greatly improved her quality of life. Through the Affordable Care Act, she has access to health insurance, which has allowed her to have better access to life-saving medications.\n\nBut there remains a stigma and fear when it comes to HIV.\n\n\u201cI still get people who think you can spread it by sharing utensils,\u201d Sugay says. Gibson adds she often has to assure people it\u2019s not passed through kissing or holding hands.\n\nThere are many ways people are trying to reduce the stigma of having HIV.\n\nSugay says there should be a push for universal screening as part of a doctor's visit.\n\n\u201cPeople should get tested and know their status,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not a life sentence anymore.\u201d\n\nBeyond creating broader awareness of the issue, Gibson hopes to help newly infected patients find their way back to normality.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still alive,\u201d Gibson says. \u201cNo matter what happens, I\u2019m here to finish what my mother started.\u201d\n\nContact reporter Michael Lyle at mlyle@reviewjournal.com or 702-387-5201.
