Though the electronic filing has made the tedious process more bearable and user-friendly for taxpayers, it has also made it much easier for criminals to scam the system.\n\nRelated: Why Your Tax Returns Aren\u2019t Safe with the IRS\n\nThanks to electronic filing, fraudsters armed only with laptops or smart phones can steal millions of dollars from taxpayers\u2014all from the comfort of their own homes.\n\n\u201cI could wake up in the comfort of my own home, and just get on a laptop, do about 15 returns a day,\u201d a former tax scammer, Corey Williams, told 60 Minutes. \u201cFifteen times $3,000 a return, that's $45,000 a day,\u201d he said, adding that he raked in this money (which is just under the annual salary of an average American worker) while \u201cwearing boxers and a t-shirt.\u201d\n\nWilliams said fraudsters buy or collect a list of stolen identities by offering say a person in the billing department of an insurance company or a doctor\u2019s office a $1,000 for a list of names and social security numbers; then they go to one of dozens of tax preparation websites and fill out bogus W-2 forms\u2014claiming modest refunds of around $3,000 \u2013 4,000. They tell the IRS where to send the money, whether it\u2019s to their home addresses, bank accounts or prepaid debit cards that can quickly be discarded.\n\nWilliams said the IRS sent him tax return money about 40 percent of the time. And it only took about seven days.\n\nIn 2012, Treasury Department auditors found that the IRS issued more than $3.3 million through 2,137 tax refunds to a single address in Lansing, Michigan.\n\nRelated: IRS is Paying Illegal Immigrants Billions of Dollars\n\nSo how are these fraudsters able to pull this off without raising suspicions from the IRS? One reason is the software used by the IRS is not programmed to kick back or stop claims with suspicious data. That\u2019s what credit card companies like Visa and American Express are able to do through sophisticated algorithms that verifications.\n\nA new report from the Government Accountability Office suggests that fraudsters are easily taking advantage of the IRS\u2019s \u201clook back\u201d compliance model\u2014where the agency issues refunds after conducting only selected reviews. For its part, under this process, the IRS prevented another $24.2 billion from being lost to fraud.\n\nStill, the GAO said auditors should hold refunds until completing all compliance checks. The problem is, under federal law, the IRS is required to send out refund checks within six weeks. This often doesn\u2019t give agency enough time to check documents like W-2 forms\u2014which aren\u2019t usually issued until months after the filing deadline.\n\nGAO auditors recommended that the IRS should \u201cassess the costs and benefits of accelerating W-2 deadlines\u201d as well as provide information to lawmakers on the processes that would be need to be adjusted to accommodate that or pre-refund matching W-2 forms.\n\nOthers don\u2019t think it\u2019s that simple.\n\nRelated: Crackdown on Offshore Tax Cheats Comes with a Price\n\nAndy Bucholz, Vice President, Government Solutions at LexisNexis Risk Solutions, said zeroing in on just the W2s \u201cunderestimates how smart the fraudsters are.\u201d\n\n\u201cHackers will just start to hack HR departments to get that information,\u201d Bucholz said. \u201cTo me the real problem is with self-reported data.\u201d\n\nThe federal government and a handful of states have enlisted a number of private companies like Lexis Nexis, IBM and SAS in the fight to curb tax fraud. The tech companies use software to run tax returns through algorithms designed to detect fraudulent claims. When claims raise flags, the tax filer in question is required to verify information by logging onto the IRS website and answering questions based on public records before he or she can collect their return.\n\nRelated: Budget Cuts and Mismanagement Boost IRS Tax Cheats\n\nThough most media attention has focused largely on tax return fraud, Bucholz stressed that the government\u2019s fraud problem is much, much bigger.\n\n\u201cThe real story is identity theft in general. It\u2019s the fastest growing, largest crime that is highly unmeasured,\u201d Bucholz said.\n\n\u201cIdentity thieves are going online and targeting every major federal program-- like unemployment benefits, food stamps, student loans and \u201canything the government is giving away,\u201d Bucholz said. \u201cNow when they offer this stuff online where they don\u2019t authenticate people, it\u2019s made the crime easier.\u201d\n\nThere have been a whole spate of identity theft cases\u2014including one where the Attorney General Eric Holder himself was a victim, according to the Department of Justice.\n\nIRS officials have acknowledged the ongoing problem and say \u201cidentity theft remains a top priority\u201d for the agency.\n\n\u201cDespite continuing budget challenges since FY 2010, the IRS continues to devote major resources to this priority area,\u201d the IRS said in a statement. \u201cSo far in Fiscal Year 2014, the IRS has initiated more than 900 new investigations into identity theft and refund fraud schemes, bringing the total number of active cases to more than 1,900.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Scam artists conned the federal government out of at least $5.2 billion in fraudulent", "title": "IRS Lets Thieves Scam Taxpayers Out of $5.2 Billion", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/09/22/IRS-Lets-Thieves-Scam-Taxpayers-Out-52-Billion", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/hacker_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/09/22/IRS-Lets-Thieves-Scam-Taxpayers-Out-52-Billion", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/hacker_article.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Scam artists conned the federal government out of at least $5.2 billion in fraudulent", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce43c\"", "article_summary": "Scam artists conned the federal government out of at least $5.2 billion in fraudulent tax refunds last year\u2014and though that estimate is shocking enough\u2014the amount is likely much higher, auditors warned on Monday.\nThe tech companies use software to run tax returns through algorithms designed to detect fraudulent claims.\nRelated: Budget Cuts and Mismanagement Boost IRS Tax CheatsThough most media attention has focused largely on tax return fraud, Bucholz stressed that the government\u2019s fraud problem is much, much bigger.\nIdentity tax refund fraud has ballooned in recent years as electronic filing gives thieves an easy way to use stolen social security numbers and simply file phony tax returns.\nIn 2012, Treasury Department auditors found that the IRS issued more than $3.3 million through 2,137 tax refunds to a single address in Lansing, Michigan."}
