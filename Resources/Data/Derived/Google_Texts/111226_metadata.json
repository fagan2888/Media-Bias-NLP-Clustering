They were attending a silent retreat.\n\nBerger, 33, a web developer, had attended a number of silent retreats over the past decade. Her husband, Jonathan Mann, a 32-year-old songwriter, had never been. The New York-based couple wanted a break from the stress of daily life.\n\n\u201cI thought the stillness would help me connect with my baby,\u201d said Berger, nearly eight months pregnant at the time.\n\nSilent meditation can be traced back thousands of years. Today\u2019s retreats last from a day to several weeks at monasteries, colleges, spas, hotels, even hospitals.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not really a vacation,\u201d cautioned Robert Epstein, senior research psychologist at the American Institute for Behavioral Research and Technology and professor of psychology at the University of the South Pacific in Fiji. \u201cIt\u2019s a very unusual experience, which can certainly be beneficial, but it\u2019s difficult in some respects, because it\u2019s a time when you are alone with your thoughts. And you can hear your thoughts very clearly.\u201d\n\nFor some people, hearing those thoughts can be difficult, though by having time and space, some people are able to \u201cexhaust the most disturbing ones and throw them away,\u201d he said.\n\nBerger and Mann both experienced what they described as a transformation during their stay at the Buddhist-influenced Insight Meditation Society in Barre, Massachusetts.\n\nMann said he found a 45-minute meditation on the second day physically painful and emotionally frustrating. Afterward, he went to his room and wept in what he described as, \u201cthe most violent emotional reaction\u201d he\u2019s ever had.\n\n\u201cThe meltdown helped a lot,\u201d he said. He decided to stop trying so hard, and started moving during the meditation periods and allowed his mind to wander.\n\nAs a result, he relaxed, and \u201csome moments of clarity came,\u201d he said.\n\nCarol Gibney, who has facilitated retreats for the past dozen years, offers this advice:\n\n\u25a0 It takes at least 24 hours for a person to move past the point of \u201cmonkey brain\u201d \u2014 racing from one thought to another \u2014 and begin to relax. Once a person relaxes, there tends to be a heightened awareness of things both internal and external.\n\n\u25a0 The stillness evokes all kinds of feelings, including frustration and even grief.\n\n\u201cCompassionate awareness is what emerges,\u201d she said. \u201cCompassion for oneself; for feelings that they might have buried and pushed aside.\u201d\n\n\u25a0 With retreats increasing in popularity, \u201cThink about what you\u2019re getting away from and what you\u2019re going to,\u201d she said.\n\n\u25a0 Finally, she advised: \u201cBe open. Expect to be surprised.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2014/08/hfwell05.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe141b\"", "article_summary": "Berger, 33, a web developer, had attended a number of silent retreats over the past decade.\nSilent meditation can be traced back thousands of years.\n\u201cI thought the stillness would help me connect with my baby,\u201d said Berger, nearly eight months pregnant at the time.\nToday\u2019s retreats last from a day to several weeks at monasteries, colleges, spas, hotels, even hospitals.\nA very pregnant Juliana Berger took a five-day trip with her husband and didn\u2019t speak to him once."}
