Nikki Haley\u2019s office told the Post and Courier it\u2019s a \u201ctragedy\u201d the Affordable Care Act prompts financial hardships for students and schools.\n\nMeanwhile, the University of South Carolina\u2019s neighbors to the north are struggling with very similar woes, as leaders of North Carolina\u2019s 17-campus UNC System are grappling with how to pay for unfunded health insurance mandates as well.\n\n\u201cOn Thursday, the Board of Governors discussed the challenges with the state\u2019s current health plan that would require all of 17 colleges in the system to pay about $5,400 for each worker\u2019s healthcare plan,\u201d reports the Charolette TWC News. \u201cIt would cost about $45 million if the UNC System had to provide health care coverage under the current state health plan.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no money provided to us or to state agencies to cover this cost,\u201d said Charles Perusse, chief operating officer of the UNC System. \u201cWe\u2019re just supposed to absorb it within our budget.\u201d\n\nNorth Carolina Agriculture and Technical State University\u2019s Chancellor Harold Martin said schools may be forced to cut hours or jobs.\n\n\u201cInclusive of cutting some of those employees, reducing their hours of work to ensure that we\u2019re able to meet within the cost options available to us our commitment to support our employees,\u201d he said.\n\nAt least one federal lawmaker is trying to ease the burden colleges face today as a result of Obamacare.\n\nRepublican Sen. John Thune recently introduced legislation that aims to exempt schools and universities from the Obamacare employer mandate that requires them to offer their workers health insurance or pay fines.\n\nThune, in a statement, said the need is great: \u201cAccording to reports, some schools across the country are eliminating teaching positions and others are reducing the number of hours teachers and staff can work in order to comply with the health care law\u2019s 30-hour work week.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese higher costs for colleges and universities are inevitability passed along to students in the form of higher tuition prices.\u201d\n\nApparently a case in point is now the University of South Carolina. And as campus leaders pass along the increased costs to students in the form of tuition increases, that hurts students, Republican leaders say.\n\n\u201cSchools around the country are now forced to spend more of their budgets on healthcare, something they cannot afford to do,\u201d Raffi Williams, deputy press secretary of the Republican National Committee, stated in an email. \u201cThis will negatively affect the students who are there to get an education so they can achieve the American Dream and find their own success.\u201d\n\nJennifer Kabbany is associate editor of The College Fix ( @JenniferKabbany )\n\nLike The College Fix on Facebook / Follow us on Twitter\n\nIMAGE: TrustyPics/Flickr", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The College Fix", "description": "Obamacare: The gift that keeps on giving.", "title": "University Hikes Tuition To Pay For Obamacare Costs - The College Fix", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 480, "identifier": "http://www.thecollegefix.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/cash.trustypics.flickr.jpg", "height": 360}, "updated_time": "2015-05-28T17:36:40-04:00", "url": "http://www.thecollegefix.com/post/18085/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.thecollegefix.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/cash.trustypics.flickr.jpg", "description": "Obamacare: The gift that keeps on giving.", "card": "summary", "title": "University Hikes Tuition To Pay For Obamacare Costs - The College Fix"}, "fb": {"admins": "672627547,1540010264,100009162449428", "app_id": 1559699120988871}, "article": {"section": "Featured", "tag": "University of South Carolina", "published_time": "2014-06-22T17:40:30-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-28T17:36:40-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde85f\"", "article_summary": "University of South Carolina\u2019s board of trustees has hiked tuition for the upcoming school year to help shoulder new health care and Obamacare implementation costs, expenses they say the public university can\u2019t afford.\n\u201cIt would cost about $45 million if the UNC System had to provide health care coverage under the current state health plan.\nAnd as campus leaders pass along the increased costs to students in the form of tuition increases, that hurts students, Republican leaders say.\nThe increase of 3.2 percent \u2013 about $342 per student \u2013 will pay for state-mandated employee pay raises, health and retirement benefits, and Affordable Care Act implementation, campus leaders say.\nImplementing Obamacare is estimated to cost the state\u2019s flagship university up to $4.5 million."}
