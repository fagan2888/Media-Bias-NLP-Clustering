As you blearily try to shake off the residue of last night\u2019s revelries, pour yourself another cuppa joe and treat yourself to a serving of our weekly concatenation of clinking, clanking, caligenous junk from the interwebs that was too stoopid to ignore altogether but that didn\u2019t quite merit a full-length post. And we\u2019ll even start your descent into hell gently, with a bad-news story that\u2019s got a Nice Times kicker. By now, you\u2019ve probably heard that Guido Barilla, the chairman of Italy\u2019s Barilla pasta proudly joined the asshat brigade last week with his vow that the company\u2019s ads would never feature same-sex families:\n\n\u201cI would never do (a commercial) with a homosexual family, not for lack of respect but because we don\u2019t agree with them. Ours is a classic family where the woman plays a fundamental role \u2026 In the interview, Barilla said he opposed adoption by gay parents, but was in favour of allowing gay marriage, which is not legal in Italy. \u2026 If gays \u201clike our pasta and our advertising, they\u2019ll eat our pasta, if they don\u2019t like it then they will not eat it and they will eat another brand,\u201d he said.\n\nPretty impressive how he manages to dismiss both gays and women in a single statement there. The inevitable agita and talk of boycotts ensued, and Barilla issued one of those \u201csorry if anyone was offended\u201d not-pologies. So there\u2019s that.\n\nAnd now the nice time: One of Barilla\u2019s biggest competitors, Bertolli, rushed to emphasize that its pasta just lurves families of all configurations; as in this ad on Bertolli Germany\u2019s MyFaceSpace page:\n\nWe especially like the multiracial bowtie pasta couple and their rigatoni baby \u2014 think it\u2019s from a previous marriage, adopted, or from a gluten donor?\n\nYour other Derpage for the week:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Happy Saturday, you slugabeds!
