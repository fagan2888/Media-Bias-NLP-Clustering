When you are so excited about something and you want to tell everybody everything about it, but you just can\u2019t find the words?\n\nThat\u2019s how good the new PBS documentary is.\n\nWeaving together crisp writing, still photographs, historic footage and moving, insightful interviews, \u201cJackie Robinson\u201d creates a full portrait of one of the most important men in American history.\n\nThis is not a caricature of \u201cSaint Jackie,\u201d the black man who broke Major League Baseball\u2019s color barrier in 1947 by \u201cturning the other cheek.\u201d This a human, three-dimensional profile of an athletically gifted, intelligent, compassionate, flawed and sometimes angry man who changed our society.\n\nThe documentary, by the iconic filmmaker Ken Burns, his daughter Sarah Burns and her husband, David McMahon, airs on Rocky Mountain PBS from 8-10 p.m. on Monday and Tuesday. It\u2019s narrated by Keith David, and features Oscar winner Jamie Foxx as the voice of Robinson in certain passages.\n\n\u201cI think this film provides a more honest sense of who Jackie was and how he reflected the African-American experience in the 20th century,\u201d said Sarah Burns, who co-wrote the documentary with her husband. \u201cI think, too often, he\u2019s been put up on a pedestal, but there is so much more to the man than Saint Jackie. And, I think, by making him more human, Jackie comes out as even more of a hero.\u201d\n\nThe idea of doing an in-depth film on Robinson was first suggested by his widow, Rachel, more than 20 years ago after Ken Burns\u2019 documentary \u201cBaseball\u201d came out.\n\nIn the new film, we watch Robinson evolve from a little boy in Pasadena, Calif., to the robust athlete who won the National League MVP award in 1949, to the white-haired, aging civil rights warrior who struggled to find his place in the violent and discordant 1960s.\n\nRachel Robinson is the film\u2019s touchstone, especially in Part I. She\u2019s nearing 94, but her acute recollection of details and her overwhelming love for her late husband touch your heart.\n\n\u201cI think the thing I miss the most is having a trusted friend,\u201d she says. \u201cThe second thing I miss the most is having his arms around me.\u201d\n\nIf you are a fan of Ken Burns\u2019 past works \u2014 \u201cThe Civil War,\u201d \u201cJazz,\u201d \u201cThe Roosevelts\u201d \u2014 you will recognize the style of this film. It\u2019s deep, multilayered and never rushed. Like the game of baseball itself.\n\nThe historic clips are incredible: There is Robinson\u2019s flat, unconventional swing; his shy smile, his joyous gallop around the bases, his aggressive slides.\n\nThere were many things about Robinson I didn\u2019t know before watching this film.\n\nDuring the militant protests of the 1960s, Robinson became worn down as he struggled to stay relevant as a civil rights leader.\n\nI knew Robinson had a big, loving family. I didn\u2019t know that his oldest son, Jackie Jr., battled heroin addiction, kicked the habit and then died in a car accident in 1971.\n\nOne of my favorite passages comes from President Obama, who explains how Robinson did more than just turn the other cheek to change a nation.\n\n\u201cPart of what I admire about Jackie Robinson is precisely his ability to approach baseball and those first two years of integration in ways that were contrary to his character, or his fundamental sense of what was right and wrong, in service of a larger cause,\u201d Obama says at the beginning of Part 2. \u201cBut that\u2019s not something that made sense for him to sustain. He had purchased the right to speak his mind many times over.\u201d\n\nI encourage you to watch \u201cJackie Robinson,\u201d and Friday, when all major-league players wear No. 42 in his honor, I hope you will stop for a moment to honor the man.\n\nPatrick Saunders: psaunders@denverpost.com or @psaundersdp\n\nSpotlight on \u2026\n\nBrandon Belt, first baseman, Giants\n\nWhat\u2019s up: San Francisco has become one of baseball\u2019s most stable and envied franchises because of its ability to hang on to its core talent. The latest example is signing Brandon Belt to a new contract that will take him through 2021. Belt, who would have been a free agent after the 2017 season, got a six-year, $79 million extension. The deal became official Saturday after Belt passed a physical.\n\nBackground: Belt, a homegrown player, struggled to win the confidence of manager Bruce Bochy early in his career but has evolved into a talented, everyday first baseman. The 27-year-old hit .280 and hit a career-high 18 home runs in 2015. He has improved in the field too, earning his first Gold Glove nomination last season.\n\nSaunders\u2019 take: Yes, the Giants spend big money on free agents, such as pitchers Johnny Cueto and Jeff Samardzija, but the secret to their long run of success continues to be their ability to spot, raise and hold onto their best young players. They\u2019ve already done that with catcher Buster Posey, ace left-hander Madison Bumgarner and shortstop Brandon Crawford. Now Belt is in the fold with a team that has another chance to win a ring. Belt, a fan favorite known as the \u201cBaby Giraffe,\u201d saw his 2015 season shortened by a concussion, his second in two years and third going back to his college career. The Giants, however, are convinced that Belt\u2019s best years are ahead of him. I think they are right.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Saunders: Why you should watch Ken Burns\u2019 new \u201cJackie Robinson\u201d documentary", "title": "Saunders: Why you should watch Ken Burns\u2019 new \u201cJackie Robinson\u201d documentary", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/04/09/saunders-why-you-should-watch-ken-burns-new-jackie-robinson-documentary/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-04-09T15:56:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-23T02:24:11+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Patrick Saunders"}, "article_summary": "Weaving together crisp writing, still photographs, historic footage and moving, insightful interviews, \u201cJackie Robinson\u201d creates a full portrait of one of the most important men in American history.\nI just finished watching \u201cJackie Robinson,\u201d and I\u2019m feeling overwhelmed.\nHe had purchased the right to speak his mind many times over.\u201dI encourage you to watch \u201cJackie Robinson,\u201d and Friday, when all major-league players wear No.\nThe documentary, by the iconic filmmaker Ken Burns, his daughter Sarah Burns and her husband, David McMahon, airs on Rocky Mountain PBS from 8-10 p.m. on Monday and Tuesday.\nIt\u2019s narrated by Keith David, and features Oscar winner Jamie Foxx as the voice of Robinson in certain passages."}
