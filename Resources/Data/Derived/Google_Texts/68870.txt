If there’s a theme at this year’s USA Pro Challenge, it was made obvious with Friday’s announcement of the final team rosters: Out with the old, in with the new.

Boulder’s Taylor Phinney, having recently returned to racing at the Tour of Utah two weeks ago after more than a year away recovering from a broken leg, will lead a wide open field of young riders at this year’s race.

Phinney will be joined by 25-year-old BMC Racing teammate Rohan Dennis of Australia, who rode the fastest time trial in Tour de France history at this year’s event, averaging 34.4 miles per hour over the 8.6-mile first stage in the Netherlands to claim the yellow jersey for a day.

While BMC is well-represented, they will be without their top general classification rider, Tejay van Garderen, the two-time defending champion, who will be racing at the Vuelta a Espana instead to go head-to-head once again with Chris Froome, this year’s Tour champion.

“Professional cycling is seeing a changing of the guards at the elite level and we are at its doorstep,” USA Pro Challenge CEO Shawn Hunter said in a statement. “Rohan Dennis and Taylor Phinney are just two of several young, rising stars of the sport we will see this year. It will be great to welcome Taylor back to race in his home state. He’s gone through so much to get back to racing. Overall, we expect a great race that is wide-open. It will be fun to see who rises to the occasion.”

Boulder-based Team Cannondale-Garmin — which won the Tour of Utah two weeks ago behind the efforts of Joe Dombrowski — is also fielding a young squad and will be without 37-year-old veteran Tom Danielson, who remains suspended by his team after testing positive for what the rider said was synthetic testosterone. Danielson was runner-up to van Garderen last year.
