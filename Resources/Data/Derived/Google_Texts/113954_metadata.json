Click here for a link to the publication from CMS regarding the 2016 Employer notice Program. Employers should be on the lookout for these notification letters; they might be hard to spot because it\u2019s unclear whom they will come from or to whom they will be addressed. They could look like junk mail, and employers don\u2019t want them to get thrown away.\n\nWhy Would A Company Get A Letter If It Complied With the ACA?: If an individual calls the Healthcare.gov helpline and attests that his employer failed to provide affordable minimum value coverage, the employee can receive coverage subsidies based on his own statements, whether accurate or not. Uninsured part-time employees, contractors and temps might have received subsidies, claiming to be full-time employees. Whether obtained by fraud or mistake, when an eligible employee receives subsidies, it brings risk to the employer.\n\n90 Days to Appeal: If an employer receives a notice, the company should act quickly because employers only have 90 days to appeal. Click here for a link to the Employer Appeal Request Form. Take note that only the Internal Revenue Service can determine whether an employer is subject to a penalty under 4980H(a) or (b).\n\nACA Retaliation Rules: Employers should carefully consider how to proceed in light of the ACA retaliation rules, which say that a company cannot \u201cdischarge or in any manner discriminate against any employee with respect to his or her compensation, terms, conditions, or other privileges of employment because the employee (or an individual acting at the request of the employee) has received a credit under the ACA or reported any violation of, or any act or omission the employee reasonably believes to be a violation of the ACA.\u201d\n\nAction Steps: We recommend that employers put a (documented) process in place to put outside counsel or other persons who are not responsible for employee discipline in charge of the notification letters and related appeals in order to help avoid or defeat a later adverse action claim. If an employer can show that the person who made a termination or disciplinary decision did not have knowledge that the employee had received a credit under the ACA or reported any violation of the ACA, that will help the company prove that it would have taken the same adverse action in the absence of the employee\u2019s protected activity.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As companies complete their Section 6055 and 6056 reporting under Affordable Care Act, now it\u2019s time to be on lookout for notices regarding ACA penalties", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "The National Law Review", "description": "As companies complete their Section 6055 and 6056 reporting under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), now it&amp;rsquo;s time to be on the lookout for notices regarding ACA penalties.\r\n\r\nWatch for Notice Lette", "title": "Affordable Care Act Compliance: So You\u2019ve Filed Your 1095-C\u2026Now What?", "url": "http://www.natlawreview.com/article/affordable-care-act-compliance-so-you-ve-filed-your-1095-c-now-what", "image": "http://www.natlawreview.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/article/aux/1092/ACA%20table%20doctor_6.jpg?itok=nQ0BkTQW", "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Nation, Government, Labor, Benefits, Affordable Care Act, Tax, Filing, ACA compliance, Penalty, Notice Letter, Section 6055, Form 1095-C, Filing,", "msvalidate.01": "5493B547C0AB527FF4CF8C4D0127302A", "google-site-verification": "SAKcOmA6_i0E79oG2TjlPWfOSs9kMM6EWAZNaT0aBtA", "verify-v1": "nSkrvEqyOIUMGKMak3OBIKcpcABac4XWK5NJKMuMtBY=", "y_key": "fe6cd8bd83ff0c09", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Legal, Business, Nation, Government, Labor, Benefits, Affordable Care Act, Tax, Filing, ACA, Penalty, Notice Letter, Section 6055, Form 1095-C, Filing,"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe019b\"", "article_summary": "Click here for a link to the publication from CMS regarding the 2016 Employer notice Program.\nUninsured part-time employees, contractors and temps might have received subsidies, claiming to be full-time employees.\n90 Days to Appeal: If an employer receives a notice, the company should act quickly because employers only have 90 days to appeal.\nTuesday, April 26, 2016As companies complete their Section 6055 and 6056 reporting under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), now it\u2019s time to be on the lookout for notices regarding ACA penalties.\nWhether obtained by fraud or mistake, when an eligible employee receives subsidies, it brings risk to the employer."}
