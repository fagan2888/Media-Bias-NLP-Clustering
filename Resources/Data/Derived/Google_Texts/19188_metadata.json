It continued:\n\nThe Postal Service identified the problem during a 2011 initiative to reduce its trailer fleet by 35 percent. While conducting a leased trailer inventory, the New Jersey plant realized it had a problem.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately,\u201d the IG wrote, \u201cthey could not account for the 35 leased trailers. They were initially determined to be missing and after an extensive search for these trailers, they were subsequently classified as lost.\u201d\n\nStill, the post office paid leasing costs for the vehicles for two more years to the tune of $250,000. \"During that period, USPS attempted to locate the trailers but 'the search did not reveal any records of trailer movements.' At that point, the Postal Service opted to purchase the trailers, and paid their supplier more than $37,000 for the titles.\"\n\nRelated: A Big Idea to Save the Post Office - Turn It into a Bank\n\nThe IG said it was issuing its alert because of \"the urgency associated with protecting leased trailers to avoid unnecessary lease and residual value expenses for lost trailers, especially in light of the Postal Service\u2019s financial constraints.\u201d\n\nAs it turns out, the IG has brought up the astounding lack of inventory control at the USPS over its leased fleet of vehicles no less than 19 times since 2001.\n\n\u201cCurrently, the Postal Service does not have a policy or an inventory system for its leased trailers,\u201d the IG said.\n\nThe postal service has vowed to implement changes to its system by March 2015. Among the IG's recommendations are using a \"satellite-tracking system and tracking devices to locate leased trailers.\"\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "As numbers go, $287,000 may seem like a drop in the bucket compared to Washington's as", "title": "Post Office Paid $287K for Trucks It Can\u2019t Find", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/08/29/Post-Office-Paid-287K-Trucks-It-Can-t-Find", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/09232011_USPS_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/08/29/Post-Office-Paid-287K-Trucks-It-Can-t-Find", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/09232011_USPS_article.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@maurmack"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "As numbers go, $287,000 may seem like a drop in the bucket compared to Washington's as", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7e2f\"", "article_summary": "At that point, the Postal Service opted to purchase the trailers, and paid their supplier more than $37,000 for the titles.\"\nWhile conducting a leased trailer inventory, the New Jersey plant realized it had a problem.\n\u201cCurrently, the Postal Service does not have a policy or an inventory system for its leased trailers,\u201d the IG said.\nIt continued:The Postal Service identified the problem during a 2011 initiative to reduce its trailer fleet by 35 percent.\nAmong the IG's recommendations are using a \"satellite-tracking system and tracking devices to locate leased trailers.\""}
