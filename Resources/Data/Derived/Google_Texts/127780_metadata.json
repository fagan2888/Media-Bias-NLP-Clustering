Previous AHA whitepapers have set forth several guiding principles for workforce transitions, all of which fall into four primary categories: team-based care; emerging healthcare models; patient/family engagement; and care coordination/transition management.\n\nThis whitepaper cites numerous case studies that demonstrate the successful implementation of these principles. For example, the Wisconsin Hospital Association found hospitals focused on team-based care and increased their ambulatory care workforce in 2014, after saving $45 million through readmission-reduction efforts the year before. Similarly, evidence-based guidelines and new care models for stroke care have helped Georgia hospitals increase the number of acute stroke patients receiving proper, timely care more than 25 percent over a four-year period.\n\nTo begin making these goals a reality, the whitepaper states, providers must take several steps, including:\n\nAssess their current workforces and patient bases to decide what type of care best fits their needs\n\nEnsure healthcare staff understand provider-specific challenges to equip them to engage patients and their families\n\nMandate team-based care and interprofessional education\n\nMake sure clinicians understand all steps and aspects of care transitions\n\nInformation technology will play a major role in the transition, according to the whitepaper, acting as a \"common fiber\" between the four major principles. Providers already are investing heavily in healthcare IT and interoperability to improve care quality and coordination. For example, as both the private sector and state and federal policymakers seek ways to reduce obstacles to improved healthcare access, increased use of telehealth shows particular promise.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the whitepaper (.pdf)\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nWisconsin hospitals reduce readmissions by 22 percent, save $34M\n\nHospital leaders share care continuum strategies\n\nInterdisciplinary practice helps hospitals improve collaboration, outcomes\n\nHow an interprofessional geriatrics workforce can treat complex, elderly patients\n\nHospital intervention cuts readmissions for patients at risk for delirium, suicide\n\nInterprofessional care model shows promise for readmission reduction, ER use\n\n5 ways community health worker programs can improve post-ACA\n\n4 strategies to measure the effect of team-based education\n\nInterprofessional healthcare takes center stage at universities, academic institutions", "article_metadata": {"description": "Amid a transitional period for the healthcare industry, healthcare providers should \"connect the dots\" between a few key guiding principles to strengthen the care continuum, according to a new whitepaper from the American Hospital Association.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Amid a transitional period for the healthcare industry, healthcare providers should \"connect the dots\" between a few key guiding principles to strengthen the care continuum, according to a new whitepaper from the American Hospital Association.", "title": "4 steps to take the healthcare continuum into the age of value-based care", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/4-steps-take-healthcare-continuum-age-value-based-care/2015-11-30", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "American Hospital Association (AHA),Care Delivery,continuum of care,health information technology,interoperability,interprofessional healthcare,Operations & Business Management,team-based care,transitions of care", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Health Information Technology,Operations & Business Management"}, "article_summary": "For example, the Wisconsin Hospital Association found hospitals focused on team-based care and increased their ambulatory care workforce in 2014, after saving $45 million through readmission-reduction efforts the year before.\nProviders already are investing heavily in healthcare IT and interoperability to improve care quality and coordination.\nPrevious AHA whitepapers have set forth several guiding principles for workforce transitions, all of which fall into four primary categories: team-based care; emerging healthcare models; patient/family engagement; and care coordination/transition management.\nMore than four years ago, the AHA's Committee on Performance Improvement established four principles as essential elements of the transition from volume-based to value-based care models: aligning providers across the continuum to improve care; use of evidence-based care improvement strategies; financial management that provides incentives for efficiency; and integrated information systems.\nSimilarly, evidence-based guidelines and new care models for stroke care have helped Georgia hospitals increase the number of acute stroke patients receiving proper, timely care more than 25 percent over a four-year period."}
