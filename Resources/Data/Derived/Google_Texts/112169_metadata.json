On the stump for Trump, both women, also known as Diamond and Silk, sing songs, celebrate Trump\u2019s immigration policy to build a huge wall at the U.S.-Mexico border, and encourage Black people to join the Republican Party. Lest these sisters\u2019 melodic enthusiasm for Trump become a distraction, the real questions are: What has Trump done for Black women lately? How will a Trump presidency make Black women\u2019s lives better?\n\n\n\nWhen I asked ESSENCE political contributor and Democratic strategist, Donna Brazile, she retorted, \u201cWhat will Trump do for Black women and their families? Nothing. He\u2019s opposed to raising the minimum wage, paid sick leave, and opposed to ACA [the Affordable Care Act].\u201d Tara Wall, also an ESSENCE political contributor and former GOP strategist, offered a more measured take on Trump, but made it clear that she had major reservations about his effectiveness. For instance, Trump does believe in saving the Social Security system, unlike many of his Republican counterparts who favor shifting Social Security funds into private retirement accounts. When I asked Wall about Trump\u2019s views on the ACA and Social Security, she remarked, \u201cThe push to repeal [Obamacare] speaks to affordability. But most conservatives believe that certain social safety nets still need to be in place. These two are not at odds with each other.\u201d\n\n\n\nTrump\u2019s tax policies do seem to favor low-income families. He proposes no income tax for single people making under $25,000 a year, and no income tax for married couples that make less than $50,000 a year. After that he uses a progressive tax rate that caps at 25 percent. He also favors exceptionally low corporate taxes, such that all businesses, whether large or small, would be taxed at a rate no higher than 15 percent.\n\n\n\nBlack women earn a mere 63 cents on the White male dollar. Could Trump\u2019s tax incentives put more money into the hands of working class Black women, and Black women who own small businesses? Wall says, \u201clower tax rates would help Black women small business owners,\u201d since, \u201csmall businesses are sometimes taxed at a higher rate than large corporations.\u201d However, Brazile rightfully points out that \u201clow taxes or no taxes often lead to a hidden tax to make up for lost revenue.\u201d Trump\u2019s tax plan, she suggests, \u201cis geared to those who already have money and already have a seat at the table.\u201d\n\n\n\nRecently, Trump met with a group of Black pastors, who seemed eager to have a seat at Trump\u2019s table. Initially, his campaign announced that these 100 Black pastors would endorse Trump for President (though this claim was later challenged by several pastors within the group). Along with a group of more than 100 progressive Black Christian pastors and religious thought leaders, I helped pen an open letter criticizing this meeting, in light of Trump\u2019s vocal antagonism to the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\n\n\nI asked Brazile whether meeting with Black pastors was an effective strategy for addressing the concerns of their predominantly Black female constituencies, especially since Black women were the top voting demographic in 2012. \u201cYou can\u2019t rewrite the script from 1960. It\u2019s an old premise,\u201d Brazile told me. \u201cThe premise [appealing to Black churchgoers] should have been discarded when Obama won. Obama\u2019s campaign was organic. He ignited a movement.\u201d The idea that Black church leaders could simply crown the next political leader went out with Obama. \u201cEven Hillary has to earn it,\u201d Brazile made clear. \u201cYou don\u2019t inherit anything anymore.\u201d\n\n\n\nStill, she applauded Trump for reaching out to Black communities. \u201cThe Black community is better when we have leverage.\u201d Wall agreed but cautioned, \u201cHow you reach out is important. How do you reach out to all constituencies in Black America? Black America is not one idea.\u201d She added, \u201cThe party is failing miserably at reaching out to Black women. Just saying, \u2018I\u2019m meeting with this group and getting their endorsement\u2019 is not enough.\u201d Wall noted that Trump needs to focus his message to Black women on the major issues that we care about: \u201ceconomy, safety, education, and social justice.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn these matters, Trump has said nothing. Instead, he has tried to entice Black women into taking him seriously by subjecting us to a singing and dancing Black women\u2019s duo. But these Black women are not, in the words of Ntozake Shange, \u201csinging a Black girl\u2019s song.\u201d Black women need policies that help us to make a decent living for our families, educate our children in good, safe schools, house them in safe neighborhoods, and not rip our families apart through violent over-policing and harshly punitive criminal justice measures. Black women\u2019s vote is critical to the success of candidates on both sides of the aisle. Everyone should be talking to us. And when they start talking, they need to say something that will help them #earnthisvote.\n\n\n\nBrittney Cooper (@professorcrunk) is a contributing writer at Salon, and teaches Women's and Gender Studies and Africana Studies at Rutgers.", "article_metadata": {"description": "If Trump actually makes it to the Oval Office, how would Black women fare?", "og": {"site_name": "Essence.com", "description": "If Trump actually makes it to the Oval Office, how would Black women fare?", "title": "What a Donald Trump Presidency Would Mean for Black Women", "url": "http://www.essence.com/2015/12/07/what-donald-trump-presidency-would-mean-black-women", "image": "http://cdn-img.essence.com/sites/default/files/images/2015/12/07/donald-trump-1_610x464_74.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": "500091559,636967203,500060514,508981852,672882124"}, "domain_type": "prod", "p": {"domain_verify": "338da9532aac4e35752dc97f6c8f1994"}, "vr": {"category": "Issues", "type": "Article", "author": "Brittney Cooper"}, "jumptime": {"headline": "What a Donald Trump Presidency Would Mean for Black Women", "url": "http://www.essence.com/2015/12/07/what-donald-trump-presidency-would-mean-black-women", "image": "true", "imageurl": "http://cdn-img.essence.com/sites/default/files/images/2015/12/07/donald-trump-1_610x464_74.jpg"}, "google-site-verification": "BofXhJNibU-39aCb9eaVK6qyU-P17J0Ls-UUmIj7WoI", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-01T11:18:41-05:00"}, "render_time": "2016-05-26 09:47:32"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0343\"", "article_summary": "Could Trump\u2019s tax incentives put more money into the hands of working class Black women, and Black women who own small businesses?\nInstead, he has tried to entice Black women into taking him seriously by subjecting us to a singing and dancing Black women\u2019s duo.\nLest these sisters\u2019 melodic enthusiasm for Trump become a distraction, the real questions are: What has Trump done for Black women lately?\nBlack America is not one idea.\u201d She added, \u201cThe party is failing miserably at reaching out to Black women.\nWhen I asked ESSENCE political contributor and Democratic strategist, Donna Brazile, she retorted, \u201cWhat will Trump do for Black women and their families?"}
