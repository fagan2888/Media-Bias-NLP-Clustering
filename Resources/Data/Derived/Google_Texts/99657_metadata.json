Money 20/20 brings together the worldwide community of innovators who are transforming the way in which consumers and businesses manage, spend and borrow money, and explores the macro trends that form the underlying common thread of innovation. AHCL will demonstrate its Financing as a Service\u2122 (FaaS\u2122) platform and explain how it is revolutionizing patient financing and helping to Make Healthcare Affordable\u2122.\n\nWith the arrival of The Affordable Care Act, the payment models within the healthcare industry are changing rapidly. The average patient share of payments for medical care increased from 5% in 2000 to over 30% in 2013. Out-of-pocket payments are expected to top $420 billion by 2015, which is a 68 percent increase in just the last five years. As patient responsibilities continue to increase, healthcare providers are looking for better ways to collect upfront payments.\n\n\"There is a major shift in patient payment responsibility that is sweeping the U.S. healthcare system today. With the rapid increase in out-of-pocket expenses, patients and providers are looking for solutions to help Make Healthcare Affordable\u2122,\" says Nick Sorensen, COO and Co-Founder of AHCL. \"We're excited to be a part of Money 20/20, and to have the opportunity to show how our patient financing platform is addressing this massive problem.\"\n\nThe AHCL cloud-based patient financing platform has been disrupting the healthcare industry by delivering affordable patient financing to patients, while charging the provider no fees per funded loan. Patients can submit a loan inquiry for any amount up to $100,000, 24 hours per day and 7 days per week, and receive instant loan decisions from anywhere and on any device.\n\nSorensen continues, \"We are only scratching the surface. As the healthcare and payment landscape continues to change, third-party financing will become absolutely essential not only in all of the elective markets we see it in today, but also in every corner of the healthcare ecosystem.\"\n\nNick Sorensen will be presenting in Starvine 10 at the Demos, Case Studies, and Announcements Track during Session 2, Wednesday morning.\n\nAbout American HealthCare Lending.
