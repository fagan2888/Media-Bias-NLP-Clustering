Although Bush acknowledges climate change, he questions whether humans are disproportionately responsible for variations in the earth\u2019s temperature.\n\nGraham Blasts His Own Party for Ignoring Global Warming Threats\n\nGlobal warming has received relatively scant attention in the early going of the 2016 presidential campaign, especially on the Republican side. During a recent appearance on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d program, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) sharply criticized other Republican presidential candidates for sidestepping environmental issues or embracing dangerously narrow positions designed to protect business.\n\nBush and four other Catholics seeking the GOP presidential nomination \u2013 Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, Gov. Chris Christi of New Jersey, former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal \u2013 generally oppose government action to control greenhouse gas emissions that scientists say directly contributes to climate change.\n\nChristie goes farther than some of the others in acknowledging the existence of global warming, in light of reams of scientific findings. \u201cThere\u2019s no use in denying global warming exists [but] the question is what we do to deal with it?\u201d he said in May. The U.S. or a group of states \u201ccan\u2019t be acting unilaterally\u2026when folks in China are doing things to the environment that would never be done in our country,\u201d he added.\n\nRelated: Obama\u2019s Budget Boosts EPA to Fight Climate Change\n\nWith Pope Francis about to weigh in on global warming, and many voters \u2013 including large numbers of Catholics\u2014concerned about the mounting threat of climate change to the planet, the issue may get more attention on the campaign trail. According to media reports, the Pope this week will call for changes in lifestyles and energy consumption to avert the \u201cunprecedented destruction of the ecosystem\u201d before the end of this century\n\nA new Pew Research Center survey published on Tuesday found that U.S. Catholics\u2019 views on climate change \u201care broadly reflective of American public opinion writ large.\u201d\n\nAbout seven-in-ten U.S. Catholics believe the planet is getting warmer, according to the survey. Nearly half of Catholic adults (47 percent) attribute global warming to human causes, and 48 percent view it as a very serious problem.\n\nAmong the general public, 68 percent believe the earth is warming, 45 percent believe warming is caused by human activity and 46 percent believe it is a serious problem.\n\nRelated: Global Warming Skeptics Give Obama the Cold Shoulder\n\nIn gauging public sentiment about this controversial issue, politics clearly is an important element of the equation. More than eight-in-ten Catholic Democrats say there is solid evidence that Earth is warming, compared with just half of Catholic Republicans, according to Pew.\n\nWhile six-in-ten Catholic Democrats say global warming is a man-made phenomenon and that it poses a very serious problem, only about a quarter of Catholic Republicans agree.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush says \u201cI don\u2019t get my economic policy\u201d from", "title": "Pope Francis is Stirring the Political Pot on Global Warming", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/06/17/Pope-Francis-Stirring-Political-Pot-Global-Warming", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/pope-vatican_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/06/17/Pope-Francis-Stirring-Political-Pot-Global-Warming", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/pope-vatican_1.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush says \u201cI don\u2019t get my economic policy\u201d from", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3e7f\"", "article_summary": "Christie goes farther than some of the others in acknowledging the existence of global warming, in light of reams of scientific findings.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no use in denying global warming exists [but] the question is what we do to deal with it?\u201d he said in May.\nRelated: Global Warming Skeptics Give Obama the Cold ShoulderIn gauging public sentiment about this controversial issue, politics clearly is an important element of the equation.\nWhile six-in-ten Catholic Democrats say global warming is a man-made phenomenon and that it poses a very serious problem, only about a quarter of Catholic Republicans agree.\nGraham Blasts His Own Party for Ignoring Global Warming ThreatsGlobal warming has received relatively scant attention in the early going of the 2016 presidential campaign, especially on the Republican side."}
