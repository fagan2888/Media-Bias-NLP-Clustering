The Derek Wolfe and Rahim Moore watch is still on.

The Broncos, after giving Wolfe the week off last week, had planned to bring him back for Monday’s practice, but he remained absent. Moore, too, was nowhere to be found; after being placed on injured reserve designated to return in November, he was eligible to practice last week but has not done so.

Shaun Phillips was also missing from the practice. He was ill, had a fever and was sent home. Coach John Fox was not required to give a full injury report Monday and thus did not give any further updates.

Other than that, though, the Broncos were healthy in Monday’s frigid temperatures as they began preparing to play San Diego on Sunday afternoon. After a light week without knowing their future opponent, it’s time to get down to business.

“It was just a matter of time,” Fox said. “They had to play the games, and those are completed, and now we know we’re playing a division team at our place.”

“You get into the playoffs, and they’re all difficult. That’s why they have the playoffs. Regardless of if they’re in your division or how many times you’ve played them, it’s a single-elimination tournament, and whoever plays the best wins.”
