Taking the stage were U.S. Sens. Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, and Rand Paul; Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey; Gov. John Kasich of Ohio; former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush; and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson.\n\nKelly, who moderated along with Fox colleagues Chris Wallace and Bret Baier, opened the proceedings at the Iowa Events Center in Des Moines by asking Cruz what message Trump\u2019s absence sent to Iowa voters.\n\nCruz didn\u2019t address that directly, but he thanked Iowans for welcoming him and his family, promised that during his presidency Iowa \u201cwill not be fly-over country\u201d but \u201cfly-to country,\u201d and then got in this dig at Trump: \u201cLet me say I\u2019m a maniac and everyone on this stage is stupid, fat, and ugly. And Ben, you\u2019re a terrible surgeon. Now that we\u2019ve gotten the Donald Trump portion out of the way...\u201d The audience erupted in laughter.\n\nKelly followed up by noting that Cruz, who has gained ground to run second to Trump in many polls, once had praised the business tycoon but is now critical of him. Cruz replied that his comments about Trump have not been personal but instead focused on \u201cissues and substance.\u201d\n\nRubio said Trump is \u201can entertaining guy\u201d and \u201cthe greatest show on earth,\u201d but the campaign is not about him. \u201cThis campaign is about the greatest country in the world and a president who has systematically destroyed many of the things that made America special,\u201d Rubio said. Rubio contended that he is best positioned to unite the Republican Party, defeat Hillary Clinton in the general election, and \u201cturn this country around once and for all, after seven years of the disaster that is Barack Obama.\u201d\n\nThe candidates\u2019 complaints about Obama were ones they have made many times: They said he has not been strong enough in fighting terrorism, said the Affordable Care Act for health insurance reform has done more harm than good, and disparaged the nuclear weapons treaty with Iran.\n\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m president we are going to rebuild our intelligence capabilities,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cAnd they\u2019re going to tell us where the terrorists are. And a rebuilt U.S. military is going to destroy these terrorists. And if we capture any of these ISIS killers alive, they are going to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we\u2019re going to find out everything they know, because when I\u2019m president, unlike Barack Obama, we will keep this country safe.\u201d\n\nOn the ACA, also known as Obamacare, Baier noted that everyone on the stage opposes it, but pointed out that it had brought health insurance to millions of Americans who had none previously. He asked Cruz, \u201cIf you repeal Obamacare, as you say you will, will you be fine if millions of those people don\u2019t have health insurance? And what is your specific plan for covering the uninsured?\u201d\n\nCruz responded by calling Obamacare \u201ca job-killer\u201d (The Washington Post says there\u2019s actually little evidence that it has cost jobs) and said he would favor market-based reforms, such as allowing people to buy health insurance across state lines, expand tax-advantaged medical savings accounts, and divorce insurance coverage from employment.\n\nRubio, Cruz, Bush, and Paul got into a long argument over who\u2019s toughest on illegal immigration and whether Rubio had changed his position on amnesty for undocumented immigrants. The exchange led Christie to say, \u201cI feel like I need a Washington-to-English dictionary converter.\u201d Christie said that\u2019s \u201cwhy you need to send someone from outside of Washington to Washington. \u2026 Stop the Washington bull and let\u2019s get things done.\u201d\n\nCruz meanwhile accused the moderators of setting up other candidates to attack him. At one point he said to Wallace, \u201cChris, I would note that that the last four questions have been, \u2018Rand, please attack Ted. Marco, please attack Ted. Chris, please attack Ted. Jeb, please attack Ted.\u2019\u201d Wallace replied, \u201cIt is a debate, sir.\u201d Cruz said, \u201cWell, no, no. A debate actually is a policy issue, but I will say this: Gosh, if you guys ask one more mean question I may have to leave the stage.\u201d But he didn\u2019t.\n\nSocial issues, including LGBT rights, came up a bit in the debate. Wallace asked Christie about his statement that Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis, who said issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples would violate her religious beliefs, should follow the law or take another job.\n\nChristie replied, \u201cI never said that Ms. Davis should either lose her job or that she had to do it. But what I did say was that the person who came in for the license needed to get it. And so if there\u2019s someone in that organization, and it turns out there was, who was willing to be able to do that, that\u2019s what we should do.\u201d\n\nThe greatest threat to religious freedom in America, Christie added, comes from radical adherents of Islam who want to impose their practices on everyone.\n\nCruz, when asked about his lack of endorsements from his fellow senators, took the opportunity to tout his endorsements by religious right leaders like James Dobson, plus political figures with similar views, like Iowa Congressman Steve King. And in his closing statement, he asked voters, \u201cWho do you know will kill the terrorists, defend the Constitution, and repeal Obamacare? Who do you know will stop amnesty and secure the borders? Who do you know will defend life, marriage, and religious liberty? Examine our records, pray on it and I will be honored if you and your family will come caucus for us on Monday night.\u201d\n\nRubio trumpeted his religiosity too. Asked about a Time magazine article that called him \u201cthe Republican savior,\u201d Rubio said, \u201cThere\u2019s only one savior and it\u2019s not me. It\u2019s Jesus Christ, who came down to earth and died for our sins.\u201d\n\nHe later said, \u201cOur Judeo-Christian values are one of the reasons why America is such a special country,\u201d adding, \u201cYou should hope that our next president is someone that is influenced by their faith. \u2026 When I'm president, I can tell you this, my faith will not just influence the way I'll govern as president, it will influence the way I live my life.\u201d\n\nIn his closing statement, he said, \u201cThe Bible commands us to let our light shine on the world. For over 200 years, America\u2019s light has been shining on the world and the world has never been the same again. But now, that light is dimming a little, after seven years of Barack Obama. \u2026 When I\u2019m president, America\u2019s light will shine again.\u201d\n\nIn other closing statements: Paul called himself \u201cthe one true fiscal conservative,\u201d in the race. Bush touted his \u201cproven record as governor of the state of Florida, as a conservative leader.\u201d Christie invoked his worries about his family during the attacks of September 11, 2001, and his record of going after terrorists as a federal prosecutor. Carson quoted the preamble to the U.S. Constitution, practically verbatim, and asked voters to think of the nation\u2019s founders, apparently putting himself forth as the man to carry out their vision.\n\nKasich, who has generally struck a more moderate tone than the other candidates, continued to do that in his closer, emphasizing the need to work in a bipartisan fashion. The nation\u2019s problems can be solved, he said, \u201cwhen we have a positive attitude, an optimistic approach, an ability for us to set the tune as conservatives, to invite other people in to be part of that orchestra.\u201d\n\nFor more, check out the Post\u2019s annotated transcript here.", "article_metadata": {"description": "They also vied for who's most religious and toughest on illegal immigration.", "og": {"image": "http://www.advocate.com/sites/advocate.com/files/2016/01/28/cruz-and-the-rest-x750.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-01-29T00:52:32-05:00", "type": "article", "title": "GOP DEBATE: Candidates Slam Trump, Dems, Each Other"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Advocate", "fb": {"page_id": 19799718480, "app_id": 625763650825412, "pages": 6030918854}, "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-29T00:52:32-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-29T00:52:32-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "He asked Cruz, \u201cIf you repeal Obamacare, as you say you will, will you be fine if millions of those people don\u2019t have health insurance?\nRubio, Cruz, Bush, and Paul got into a long argument over who\u2019s toughest on illegal immigration and whether Rubio had changed his position on amnesty for undocumented immigrants.\nTed Cruz, Marco Rubio, and Rand Paul; Gov.\nJeb, please attack Ted.\u2019\u201d Wallace replied, \u201cIt is a debate, sir.\u201d Cruz said, \u201cWell, no, no.\nWallace asked Christie about his statement that Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis, who said issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples would violate her religious beliefs, should follow the law or take another job."}
