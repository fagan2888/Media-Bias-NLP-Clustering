LOUIS (KTVI) - As the year-ends, it's time to reduce your 2015 taxes and get your personal finances ready for 2016. Don Chamberlin, President of The Chamberlin Group, visits Fox 2 News in the Morning to discuss tax law changes, as well as new Obamacare provisions, to help you avoid penalties and fees.\n\nThe following notes come courtesy of The Chamberlin Group.\n\n1. MAXIMIZE YOUR RETIREMENT CONTRIBUTIONS\n\nAre you funding your 401(k) with payroll deductions? In 2015, the maximum 401(k) contribution has been increased to $18,000 or $24,000 for those over 50. Even if you can`t save the top amount, try to contribute enough to maximize your employer\u2019s match. If you want to contribute more, talk to your employer about raising your payroll deductions for the rest of the year.\n\nFor those with a traditional IRA, the maximum contribution is unchanged from 2014 - $5,500, or $6,500 for those over 50. The same is true for Roth IRA contributions. If you`re concerned that your income is too high to qualify for a Roth contribution, you may consider the 'backdoor Roth conversion' where you contribute to a traditional IRA, then convert to a Roth, which is not currently subject to income limitation. Check with your financial advisor to find out if this strategy makes sense for you. You can make a 2015 contribution to your IRA anytime until Tax Day, which this year will be April 18, 2016.\n\n2. TIME YOUR INCOME, DEDUCTIONS AND LOSSES\n\nAre you expecting a bonus or commission payment in late 2015? You may want to ask your employer to defer these until early 2016 to keep your taxable income minimized for the current year.\n\nMake certain all of your planned charitable donations and gifts are made by December 31. If you plan to gift money to family and friends before year-end, you may do so in amounts of up to $14,000 per person without paying the federal gift tax. This is the same federal gift tax limit that was in place in 2014, and it will remain unchanged through the end of 2016.\n\nAre you contributing to a 529 college savings plan? Many states offer tax deductions for 529 contributions. Look into how maximizing your contribution might also cut your state taxes.\n\nDoes your taxable portfolio include some losing stocks or mutual funds that you want to sell? The IRS allows a deduction of up to $ 3,000 a year from capital losses, but the sale must be before year-end. Do your losses exceed $3,000? You can use this value to offset capital gains realized for the year or carry forward the additional losses into future years. Finally, if you had losses exceeding $3,000 in previous years, you may be able to claim them in 2015 and future years.\n\n3. Check Your Medical Expenses\n\nDid your family have significant medical expenses in 2015? If your total qualified expenses exceed 10% of your Adjusted Family Income, you can take the amount over 10% as an itemized deduction. (For those over 65 years old, the expense threshold is 7.5% in 2015 and 2016.) Refer to IRS publications to make sure all of your expenses can be deducted. For example, insurance premiums qualify, but cosmetic surgery doesn\u2019t.\n\n4. DON\u2019T GET HIT BY OBAMACARE PENALTIES\n\nThe Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) requires individuals and families to have healthcare insurance. The penalties for not having coverage increased sharply in 2015.\n\nThose without healthcare insurance during 2015 face minimum penalties of $325 per adult and, for those in higher tax brackets, as much as 2% of family income. While there are exemptions for these penalties, many will not qualify.\n\nThe penalties increase again in 2016, to a minimum of $695 per adult and up to 2.5% of income for high bracket taxpayers. If you want to avoid 2016 penalties, shop now for a qualified insurance plan.\n\n5. AVOID 401(K) AND IRA MINIMUM DISTRIBUTION PENALTIES\n\nIf you turned 70\u00bd in 2015 and have retirement plans funded with pre-tax contributions, you`ll need to start taking Required Minimum Distributions, or RMDs. (Roth plans, funded with after-tax money, don`t require RMDs.) Not taking a distribution or missing the distribution deadline will result in a 50% tax on the required RMD. Partial distributions are also penalized. As of mid-November, according to a Fidelity review of more than 800,000 in-house accounts, 67 percent of IRA holders required to take distributions have not met their full requirement, and in 54 percent of the accounts, zero distributions have yet been taken.\n\nRMDs are based on your age and total account value on December 31 each year.
