Re “If Law ‘Is Here to Stay,’ So Are Doubts About It” (news analysis, front page, June 26):

As a nurse practitioner and a professor of nursing at Pace University, I am baffled by those who are so eager to overturn a law that provides health care to millions of people, the Affordable Care Act. Do they think it’s just fine that Americans die routinely of preventable and treatable illnesses because they have no insurance?

Have they ever come face to face with a terrified person who discovered a lump in her breast, started coughing up blood or endured any of an array of frightening symptoms, but who did not have insurance and could only hope and pray that everything would be O.K.? I have, and it is heartbreaking.

The educator in me wonders why the same people who decry public funding for medical care have no problem with publicly funded education. Is health care a privilege, rather than a right, like education, deserved only by those who can afford it?

Common sense dictates that they both are rights. I just don’t get it.
