Weekly Standard columnist and Fox News contributor Stephen Hayes took to twitter on Tuesday with an unexpected announcement: The Department of Homeland Security has added him to a terrorist watch list.

“Just informed I’m on the @DHSgov terrorist watch list. Explains why I have been subject to extra screening each of my recent trips,” the columnist tweeted.

Mr. Hayes then added that when he tried to file a redress form about the designation on the DHS website, the form could not be processed.

When a follower asked the columnist how he found out that he was being eyed by the federal government as a potential threat to national security, he replied “I was flagged for extra screening on my last two trips. A ‘selectee.’ Called in the TSA supervisor to handle.”

Mr. Hayes added that he recently booked a one-way trip to Turkey with a return flight through Athens, Greece.

DHS was asked to comment on Mr. Hayes‘ situation by Business Insider, but the website did not receive a reply before publication.
