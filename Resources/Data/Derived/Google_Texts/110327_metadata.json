We all mocked George W. when he called himself the decider -- now we know what an indecisive Bush looks like. Republican\n\n2 HILLARY CLINTON: 'WE WERE DEAD BROKE' The oblivious chutzpah is a classic sort of gaffe: the one where a politician inadvertently confirms their critics\u2019 narrative. The GOP plans to counter Clinton\u2019s populist economic moves by tagging her as elitist, out-of-touch and entitled. When she insisted that she and Bill were \u201cbroke,\u201d after his White House tenure ended, she sure sounded that way. And she knows it. Democrat\n\n3 SCOTT WALKER ON LEGAL IMMIGRATION Nearly every GOP candidate is going to speak out against illegal immigration. But Walker took things a step too far when he suggested that something needs to be done about legal immigration. A fearmongering appeal (in an interview with Glenn Beck, natch!) to tea party xenophobes that misjudged where the GOP is now, and is headed. A classic Kinsley gaffe, in which he apparently said what he really thinks. Bad move. Republican\n\n4 RAND PAUL ON BALTIMORE \u201cI came through the train on Baltimore,\u201d Rand Paul said to Laura Ingraham, \u201cI\u2019m glad it didn\u2019t stop.\u201d First, the train always stops in Baltimore. Second, this is not the right thing for a guy who is staking a large part of his candidacy on reforming the criminal justice system to say. Finally, isn\u2019t Paul supposed to be self-styled \u201canti-elite?\u201d If so, the image of him pearl-clutching his way through Baltimore while traveling to more esteemed locales is not a good look. Republican\n\n5 BEN CARSON COMPARING OBAMACARE TO SLAVERY Just some general rules. Don't compare things to slavery . Don\u2019t compare them to the Holocaust. Don\u2019t compare them to 9/11, Hurricane Katrina, or Nazi Germany. If you want to stay on the safe side, leave the My Lai massacre, the Rwandan genocide, and the movie \u201cIshtar\u201d alone, too. No matter how bad Obamacare is, it can be repealed legislatively. Would that slavery had been the same! Republican\n\n6 CHRIS CHRISTIE KNOWS BETTER THAN CIVIL RIGHTS LEADERS In an attempt to convey his preference for a New Jersey citizen referendum on marriage equality, Christie quipped, \"I think people would have been happy to have a referendum on civil rights rather than fighting and dying in the streets in the South. \u201d Which, no. Think about how that referendum would have gone. Hey dude, you may know South Orange, but ditch the sweeping historical rhetoric about race and the South. We know it\u2019s not the Jersey way, but don\u2019t talk about something you don\u2019t know anything about. Republican\n\n7 RICK SANTORUM ON GAY WEDDINGS been to a wedding? The most important function of the ceremony is to allow those gathered to proclaim that they will \"love and support\" the couple. Clever Rick is, essentially, just cheating himself of some canapes and dancing. Asked if he\u2019d attend the same-sex wedding of a dear friend, Santorum said, \"I would love them and support them, but I would not participate in that ceremony.\" Has he notto a wedding? The most important function of the ceremony is to allow those gathered to proclaim that they will \"love and support\" the couple. Clever Rick is, essentially, just cheating himself of some canapes and dancing. Republican\n\n8 LINDSEY GRAHAM'S NONEXISTENT COUP GAFFE Pour some Twitter on an innocent, tongue-in-cheek statement , and you have yourself a gaffe. In this case, Graham was victimized after he quipped, \"I would literally use the military to keep them in if I had to. We\u2019re not leaving town until we restore these defense cuts.\" It was meant to be a ha-ha, but all it took was one crank taking it way too seriously to turn it into a thing. Republican\n\n9 BERNIE SANDERS' LOVE FOR SCANDINAVIA Bernie Sanders has fair points to make about the Scandinavian nations and their high level of voter participation and low levels of economic inequities. But when you\u2019re running for president of the United States, you\u2019re sort of required to hew to a comic book notion of \u201cAmerican exceptionalism.\u201d Democrat", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.expire_date": "2015-05-19 05:33:36 -0400", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "title": "Trail To The Chief: 2016 Gaffe Edition", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/15/trail-to-the-chief-gaffe_n_7293262.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2956990/images/o-JEB-BUSH-SAD-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2956990/images/o-JEB-BUSH-SAD-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "creator": "LaurenWeberHP", "site": "@HuffPostPol", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Trail To The Chief: 2016 Gaffe Edition"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-05-18 05:33:36 -0400", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=7293262", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "trail-to-the-chief,gaffe,2016 election,jeb bush,Hillary Clinton,Ted Cruz,Scott Walker,2016 candidates", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "trail-to-the-chief,gaffe,2016 election,jeb bush,Hillary Clinton,Ted Cruz,Scott Walker,2016 candidates", "published_time": "2015-05-18 05:33:36 -0400", "modified_time": "2015-05-18 05:59:02 -0400"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "article_summary": "Republican8 LINDSEY GRAHAM'S NONEXISTENT COUP GAFFE Pour some Twitter on an innocent, tongue-in-cheek statement , and you have yourself a gaffe.\nHey dude, you may know South Orange, but ditch the sweeping historical rhetoric about race and the South.\nWe know it\u2019s not the Jersey way, but don\u2019t talk about something you don\u2019t know anything about.\nRepublican2 HILLARY CLINTON: 'WE WERE DEAD BROKE' The oblivious chutzpah is a classic sort of gaffe: the one where a politician inadvertently confirms their critics\u2019 narrative.\nA classic Kinsley gaffe, in which he apparently said what he really thinks."}
