The judge says young people sentenced to the Irma youth prisons aren\u2019t getting appropriate care. She called for additional mental health care workers and the expansion of a program that keeps offenders in Milwaukee County.\n\nThe youth prison investigation has focused on allegations of excessive use of force at the facilities that share a campus more than 200 miles north of Milwaukee. The probe has been ongoing for more than a year. A Lincoln County judge has found reason to believe crimes occurred there, including sexual assault and physical abuse.\n\nIt now falls to the county executive to draft a plan for how to spend the emergency funding. Abele hasn\u2019t commented on the board plan and didn\u2019t attend the meeting because he was at the opening of a new facility for survivors of domestic violence, his spokeswoman, Melissa Baldauff, said. Abele did, however, request board funding Wednesday for a $744,000 plan that would create a team of 12 staffers who would monitor youth at Lincoln Hills. Baldauff said the pitch came from weeks of meetings with a group that includes Judge White and other stakeholders.\n\nAbele\u2019s chief concern, Baldauff said, is \u201creaching our shared goal of keeping these kids safe and ensuring they have the supportive services they need.\u201d\n\nBoard Chairman Theodore Lipscomb Sr. said the county executive\u2019s plan will be funded through the Department of Health and Human Services budget, and the requested spending was approved with Thursday\u2019s vote. The additional $500,000 would go toward expanding Milwaukee County housing and services for young offenders by more than 40 beds.\n\n\u201cThe board\u2019s plan recognized the need for greater expansion,\u201d which White requested in her letter, Lipscomb said.\n\nWisconsin Department of Corrections spokeswoman Joy Staab said in an email to The Associated Press that the top priority is the safety and security of youth. Staab said the corrections department will continue to work with counties \u201cand stay focused on our mission of providing treatment and programing to youth in a safe and secure environment.\u201d\n\nShe said there were 246 youth at Lincoln Hills and Copper Lake on Thursday, and the department will adjust facility operations as needed as the youth population changes.\n\n___\n\nFollow Greg Moore at https://twitter.com/writingmoore", "article_metadata": {"description": "Milwaukee County supervisors voted Thursday to declare a state of emergency at the state's troubled youth prisons and release $500,000 to seek alternative housing for offenders held at the Lincoln Hills and Copper Lake facilities, which are under a sweeping state and federal investigation into allegations of abuse by staffers.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/feb/4/milwaukee-county-to-pursue-lincoln-hills-alternati/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "Milwaukee County supervisors voted Thursday to declare a state of emergency at the state\u2019s troubled youth prisons and release $500,000 to seek alternative housing for offenders held at the Lincoln Hills and Copper Lake facilities, which are under a sweeping state and federal investigation into allegations of abuse by staffers.", "title": "Milwaukee County to pursue Lincoln Hills alternative"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "description": "Milwaukee County supervisors voted Thursday to declare a state of emergency at the state's troubled youth prisons and release $500,000 to seek alternative housing for offenders held at the Lincoln Hil", "card": "summary", "title": "Milwaukee County to pursue Lincoln Hills alternative"}, "Author": "GREG MOORE", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "A Lincoln County judge has found reason to believe crimes occurred there, including sexual assault and physical abuse.\nShe called for additional mental health care workers and the expansion of a program that keeps offenders in Milwaukee County.\nThe additional $500,000 would go toward expanding Milwaukee County housing and services for young offenders by more than 40 beds.\nBaldauff said the pitch came from weeks of meetings with a group that includes Judge White and other stakeholders.\nThe unanimous vote authorized a plan that includes suggestions from Milwaukee County Chief Judge Maxine Aldridge White, who sent a letter supporting immediate action to the board and to County Executive Chris Abele."}
