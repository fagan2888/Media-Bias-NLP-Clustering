To download the full e-book for free, go to wsj.com/fed\n\nWhen President Barack Obama called on Janet Yellen to become the next leader of the Federal Reserve, he placed in the hands of the five-foot-tall, gray-haired economist from Brooklyn one of the most consequential challenges of our time.\n\nShe has to decide when the recovering US economy is ready to stand on its own without the unconventional cocktail of financial medicine the nation\u2019s central bank has administered to it during the past six years of market turmoil, recession and sluggish recovery.\n\nBut when that moment of normalcy will come is highly uncertain and government officials have fumbled it in the past, with grave consequences. During the Great Depression, the Fed tightened credit at key moments when the economy was still vulnerable, such as in 1931 and 1937, prolonging the human misery resulting from the deep downturn. In the 1970s, the Fed kept credit cheap for too long and inflation ensued. In the 2000s, the Fed kept rates low after another recession, potentially contributing to the housing bubble that emerged.\n\nMs. Yellen\u2019s first decision comes Wednesday, March 19, when the Fed completes its first policy meeting under her leadership. These issues will be front and center The Fed started pulling back its bond-buying program in December 2013, a process she has signaled will continue. Next, she has to decide when to start raising interest rates from near zero, a process she wants to defer as long as inflation is low and no new financial bubbles emerge.\n\n\u201cWhile we have made progress, we have farther to go,\u201d said Ms. Yellen, standing beside Mr. Obama in October 2013, when he announced he was nominating her to the top Fed post. \u201cThe mandate of the Federal Reserve is to serve all the American people, and too many Americans still can\u2019t find a job and worry how they will pay their bills and provide for their families. The Federal Reserve can help, if it does its job effectively. We can help ensure that everyone has the opportunity to work hard and build a better life. We can ensure that inflation remains in check and doesn\u2019t undermine the benefits of a growing economy. We can and must safeguard the financial system.\u201d\n\nWho is Janet Yellen? What experiences formed her? Can the nation trust her judgment?\n\nThe stories in our e-book on Ms. Yellen \u2014 based on decades of Wall Street Journal reporting about the economy, the central bank and national policy makers \u2014 form the first in-depth portrait of the woman with the levers of the global financial system at her fingertips.\n\nTo download the full e-book for free, go to wsj.com/fed", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Read a new, free e-book from the Wall Street Journal chronicling Janet Yellen's path to Fed chairwoman.", "title": "Yellen and the Fed, a WSJ Briefing", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2014/03/17/yellen-and-the-fed-a-wsj-briefing/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-BY551_yellen_P_20140317164447.jpg"}, "site": "WSJecon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Economy", "article.headline": "Yellen and the Fed, a WSJ Briefing", "description": "Read a new, free e-book from the Wall Street Journal chronicling Janet Yellen's path to Fed chairwoman.", "article_section": "Economy", "author": "Jon Hilsenrath", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "Real Time Economics Blog", "page.subsection": "Real Time Economics", "article.summary": "Read a new, free e-book from the Wall Street Journal chronicling Janet Yellen's path to Fed chairwoman.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2014-03-17T20:48:36-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-141", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2014/03/17/yellen-and-the-fed-a-wsj-briefing/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-REB-23883", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Economy", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Read a new, free e-book from the Wall Street Journal chronicling Janet Yellen's path to Fed chairwoman.", "title": "Yellen and the Fed, a WSJ Briefing", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2014/03/17/yellen-and-the-fed-a-wsj-briefing/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-BY551_yellen_P_20140317164447.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Real Time Economics", "article.id": "BL-REB-23883", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-04-28T23:29:47-04:00"}, "article_summary": "The following is from a new e-book chronicling Janet Yellen\u2019s path to Fed chairwoman.\nWe can and must safeguard the financial system.\u201dWho is Janet Yellen?\nThe Federal Reserve can help, if it does its job effectively.\nMs. Yellen\u2019s first decision comes Wednesday, March 19, when the Fed completes its first policy meeting under her leadership.\nIn the 2000s, the Fed kept rates low after another recession, potentially contributing to the housing bubble that emerged."}
