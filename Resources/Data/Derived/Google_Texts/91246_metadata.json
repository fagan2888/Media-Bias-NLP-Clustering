McGarrett (Alex O\u2019Loughlin) and Williams (Scott Caan) are told that the president is due to touchdown in Hawaii in six hours for his Thanksgiving vacation, and that Russo was clearing houses near the one the President will be staying in.\n\nObama is not name-checked in the episode directly, but audiences are told the president is visiting his home state of Hawaii (where Obama was born).\n\nThey also discover that texts were sent with the agent\u2019s phone after he was already dead, leading the advance team\u2019s leader to be concerned that sensitive information, including the POTUS\u2019 itinerary and Secret Service emergency contingency plans, may have been compromise because they are stored on the agent\u2019s phone.The assumption is that with this information compromised, and the agent\u2019s murder apparently being a professional job, the President could be the target of an assassination.\n\nThe Secret Service team leader says he doesn\u2019t have the manpower to investigate this imminent threat, so they ask Five-0 to find out who killed their agent and is planning to assassinate the president.\n\nMcGarrett and Williams retrace the dead agent\u2019s movements back to the house he was clearing the night before. There they find an empty house and a .762 NATO sniper cartridge on the ground. In addition, a neighbor who looks after the house for the owners gives them a description of the man that is renting the home and tells them that after the agent interviewed the tenant, he left and was followed shortly thereafter by the renter.\n\nWith the threat apparently confirmed, McGarrett tells the Secret Service they need to cancel the President\u2019s arrival, but is informed that the President won\u2019t cancel his trip. Shocked that the President would be unwilling to change his vacation plans despite the threat, McGarrett demands to know why the President is really coming to Hawaii since it\u2019s obviously not just to spend Thanksgiving in his home state.\n\nHe\u2019s informed that the President will be meeting with a small group of North Koreans and that this meeting could lead to \u201cnuclear disarmament or even regime change\u201d in North Korea.\n\nVideo surveillance footage shows agent Russo being followed, attacked and killed. Using that video the Five-0 team is able to run facial recognition and identify the killer as a gun for hire name Barkov. That information leads to a \u201ccleaner\u201d named Moreno that Barkov has used in the past whose modus operandi is using lye to dispose of bodies.\n\nAfter capturing and interrogating Moreno it becomes clear that the President isn\u2019t actually the target, but that the Secret Service agent stumbled upon the hired killer who is actually targeting someone that lives next door to the house he was renting. Of course Five-0 saves the real target at the last minute and catches the assassin and the cleaner.\n\nWhat\u2019s remarkable and ridiculous here is the way that the President is depicted as brave enough, despite the apparent threat to his life, to go to Hawaii to meet with this fictional North Korean group that might somehow get North Korea to give up its nuclear arms and/or change the regime there.\n\nIn real life, Obama only seems to be interested in regime change when the regime in power is an ally of the United States, like Hosni Mubarak in Egypt. Obama had the opportunity to stand up for the people of Iran during the Green Revolution and wasn\u2019t even brave enough to speak out as unarmed student protesters were slaughtered in the streets.\n\nThe other disturbing element in the episode is the way the Secret Service is depicted as under staffed, unable to prevent the President from changing his itinerary in the face of an imminent threat and supposedly keeping sensitive information on something as insecure as a smart phone.\n\nBut this is par for the course for a show that once showed Williams berate a gun shop owner for not keeping records of ammunition sales (which isn\u2019t required by law) and also made it look like child\u2019s play to infiltrate North Korea and get back out without ever encountering a single North Korean soldier.", "article_metadata": {"description": "'Hawaii Five-0' Shows Obama Pursuing Regime Change, Disarmament in North Korea", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "'Hawaii Five-0' Shows Obama Pursuing Regime Change, Disarmament in North Korea", "title": "'Hawaii Five-0' Shows Obama Pursuing Regime Change, Disarmament in North Korea - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Hollywood/2013/11/22/hawaii/Hawaii.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2013/11/24/hawaii-five-o-obama-north-korea/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "'Hawaii Five-0' Shows Obama Pursuing Regime Change, Disarmament in North Korea", "title": "'Hawaii Five-0' Shows Obama Pursuing Regime Change, Disarmament in North Korea - Breitbart", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Hollywood/2013/11/22/hawaii/Hawaii.jpg", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "pages": 95475020353}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "CBS, Iran, Secret Service,Big Hollywood,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Hollywood", "tag": "Secret Service", "published_time": "2013-11-24T08:51:00-07:00", "categories": "Big Hollywood"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0996\"", "article_summary": "The Five-0 team informs the head of the President\u2019s personal protection advance team.\nUsing that video the Five-0 team is able to run facial recognition and identify the killer as a gun for hire name Barkov.\nHe\u2019s informed that the President will be meeting with a small group of North Koreans and that this meeting could lead to \u201cnuclear disarmament or even regime change\u201d in North Korea.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThis week\u2019s episode of the CBS drama Hawaii Five-0 featured depictions of President Barack Obama and the United States Secret Service that turn reality on its head.\nObama is not name-checked in the episode directly, but audiences are told the president is visiting his home state of Hawaii (where Obama was born)."}
