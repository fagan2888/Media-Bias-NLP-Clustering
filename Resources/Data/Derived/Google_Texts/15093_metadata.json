Overall, 20 percent of customers said they were treated \u201cworse than other retailers\u201d by postal employees.\n\nRelated: Post Office Paid $287K on Trucks It Can't Find\n\nPart of the problem, the auditors found, was collective bargaining agreements with unions that mandate USPS management select sales associates positions based on seniority rather than suitability for the job.\n\nOther retailers, the IG said, ensure workers are up to the task of face-to-face customer interaction before placing them in a position that requires it. Once the employees are designated sales associates, the report said, \u201cresolving serious issues related to that employee, such as persistent discourteous behavior, can be difficult and time-consuming.\u201d\n\nThe American Postal Workers Union, cited directly in the report, said the customer service problem is not that employees are rude or misplaced, but that there are simply not enough of them.\n\n\u201cThe No. 1 complaint of postal customers is the waiting time in line, which is caused by understaffing,\u201d APWU\u2019s Clerk Craft Director Clint Burelson told Government Executive. \u201cWe urge postal management to correct this problem and give the people the service they want and deserve.\u201d\n\nRelated: Big Idea to Save the Post Office: Turn It into a Bank\n\nAnother major barrier to better customer service, according to the report, is a lack of training dedicated to those skills. Auditors described it as \u201cinformal\u201d and without a \u201cmandatory process\u201d for managers to observe and provide feedback to their workers. Noting the 20 percent dissatisfaction rate, the IG said the Postal Service is risking $288.5 million in fiscal 2015 by incentivizing unhappy customers to take their business elsewhere.\n\nIn a word cloud the IG created to demonstrate the frequency with which postal customers described their experiences on a survey, the word \u201crude\u201d was displayed most prominently.\n\nPostal management - which has long touted the Postal Service\u2019s relative customer service advantage - dismissed the IG\u2019s findings out of hand, calling them \u201cirrelevant.\u201d James Nemec and Kelly Sigmon, vice presidents for consumer affairs and customer service operations, respectively, said in a letter to the inspector general that auditors used data from old surveys that have since been replaced.\n\nRelated: Post Office Bleeds $2B Despite Price Hike\n\nThey added the fact that 20.5 percent of customers were not treated \u201cwith courtesy\u201d does not necessarily mean all those customers would actually choose a different provider, thereby invalidating the $288.5 million figure. Nemec and Sigmon also said the Postal Service provides sufficient customer service training to its employees.\n\nThe IG\u2019s office said it would use the new survey format - which postal management says is shorter and garnering a better response rate - in future analyses. It defended its findings, however, as it measured information based on \u201cthe most complete data available.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared in Government Executive.\n\nRead more at Government Executive:\n\nObama Calls for Major USPS Reforms\n\nSenator Looks to Keystone Bill to Stop Postal Office Closures\n\n3 Tips for Building a Data-Based Strategy", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "\u201cRude\u201d employees at U.S.", "title": "Cost to Postal Service of Its \u2018Rude\u2019 Workers: $300 Million", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/11/Cost-Postal-Service-Its-Rude-Workers-300-Million", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/09052011_USPS_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/11/Cost-Postal-Service-Its-Rude-Workers-300-Million", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/09052011_USPS_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "\u201cRude\u201d employees at U.S.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca17a\"", "article_summary": "Postal Service locations could cost the cash-strapped agency nearly $300 million in fiscal 2015, according to a report.\nNemec and Sigmon also said the Postal Service provides sufficient customer service training to its employees.\n1 complaint of postal customers is the waiting time in line, which is caused by understaffing,\u201d APWU\u2019s Clerk Craft Director Clint Burelson told Government Executive.\nNoting the 20 percent dissatisfaction rate, the IG said the Postal Service is risking $288.5 million in fiscal 2015 by incentivizing unhappy customers to take their business elsewhere.\nRead more at Government Executive:Obama Calls for Major USPS ReformsSenator Looks to Keystone Bill to Stop Postal Office Closures3 Tips for Building a Data-Based Strategy"}
