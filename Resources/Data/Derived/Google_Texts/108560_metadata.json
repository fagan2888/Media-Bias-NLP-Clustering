New research suggests that inequality might be growing even faster than we thought. Worryingly, this concentration of wealth has coincided with a concentration of debt at the bottom, as families struggle to maintain their standards of living with stagnating incomes. But even this data understates wealth inequality, argues Gabriel Zucman in \u201cThe Hidden Wealth of Nations,\u201d because official statistics fail to capture offshore wealth holdings.\n\nZucman is an assistant professor of economics at the London School of Economics and a visiting scholar at UC Berkeley. At only 27, he\u2019s already co-authored papers with economics superstar Thomas Piketty. His most recent paper estimates that global offshore holdings total $7.6 trillion and rob governments of hundreds of billions in tax revenues each year. He also finds that over the past few decades, companies have stored more and more profits overseas, making the effective corporate tax rate less than half the tax rate on the books.\n\nAll of this is happening at the same time as Thomas Piketty\u2019s blockbuster treatise, \u201cCapital in the Twenty-First Century,\u201d has brought the issue of wealth and income inequality to the forefront of the political discussion by introducing historical data on inequality. Piketty argues that the best way to address the data, political and economic concerns of wealth is a progressive international tax on wealth holdings, as well as policies to build wealth for the middle class. What was once a technocratic discussion about efficiency has become a deeply political debate about who gets what, as slow growth makes distribution more important. Even the most conservative economists have to grapple (albeit clumsily) with addressing the moral dimension of inequality.\n\nThe extent to which inequality has been a historic fixture of market economies, punctured only during what economists call \u201cThe Great Compression\u201d of the mid-20th century, has led to an intense debate among economists. Was the \u201cGreat Compression\u201d the result of forces like war, unprecedented innovation and environmentally unsustainable population growth or the rise of powerful working class interests? Is it possible for the middle class to fight against entrenched interests that increasingly control the political as well as the economic system?\n\nI talked with one of the most luminous young economists on wealth inequality and how to fight it.\n\nStarting on the more wonky side, there was a bit of a discussion in your research involving the distinction between tax evasion and tax avoidance. I believe the former being illegal and the latter being legal but sketchy. Could you talk a little bit about how you dealt with that in your research?\n\nAbsolutely. Several things to distinguish. On the one hand, there\u2019s tax evasion by wealthy individuals, which is just having bank accounts in foreign countries and earning investment income on these accounts and failing to report that income to the IRS. That\u2019s pure tax evasion. That\u2019s completely illegal. Another thing is corporate tax avoidance, usually [by] multinational corporations [that] try to operate within the letter, if not the spirit of the law. You can say, \u201cWell, it\u2019s legal.\u201d But it depends with the definition of legal. Usually some of them conduct illegal activities, but most multinational corporations at least try to stay within the letter of the law. I guess that\u2019s the key distinction.\n\nThen there\u2019s another distinction, which is regarding households, regarding individuals. Some of them have bank accounts in tax havens in Switzerland and other countries and declare their holdings and their income to the IRS, to their home country tax authorities. Having foreign accounts is not illegal, per se. What is illegal is failing to declare the accounts and the income generated by these accounts. I\u2019ve tried to take that into account in my computations: What\u2019s the fraction of overall bank accounts of individuals which are declared to tax authorities? The existing evidence is limited, but what we have suggests that at least globally about 80 percent of the bank accounts in tax havens are not declared to tax authorities. The bulk of the private wealth held offshore evades taxes.\n\nAnd is therefore illegal?\n\nYes, that\u2019s completely illegal.\n\nNow, $7.6 trillion I believe was the number that you came up with stashed in these offshore accounts. What is the impact of that with regard to the distribution of wealth?\n\nThat\u2019s an interesting question. What I can say is that I think that today it\u2019s increasingly difficult to measure wealth and to estimate the distribution of wealth. There are many reasons to believe that the estimates that we have \u2014 based on survey data, on tax data, or even the likes of Forbes Magazine, all these data sources \u2014 if anything understate the true level of wealth concentration. The reason is that there is a growing fraction of total world wealth held offshore. As I said, the bulk of it evades taxes so it\u2019s not reported on tax returns. It\u2019s unlikely that it\u2019s reported in surveys and so on.\n\nThe big idea is that because of the development of the offshore wealth management industry, it\u2019s getting more and more complicated to accurately measure the distribution of wealth at the very top, and it\u2019s likely that we substantially underestimate wealthy inequality. Particularly in Europe and in developing countries, this is a first-order problem.\n\nIt seems the increase in wealth inequality has also coincided with an increase in debt inequality. There have been many more middle class and poor families taking on debt. Do you see those trends as at all correlated or is there anything there?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Piketty prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Gabriel Zucman explains how the world's wealthiest are scamming governments for trillions", "title": "Conspiracy of the plutocrats: Secrets of the wealth-inequality explosion revealed", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Piketty prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Gabriel Zucman explains how the world's wealthiest are scamming governments for trillions", "title": "Conspiracy of the plutocrats: Secrets of the wealth-inequality explosion revealed", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/28/conspiracy_of_the_plutocrats_secrets_of_the_wealth_inequality_explosion_revealed/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/zucman_piketty.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Piketty prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Gabriel Zucman explains how the world's wealthiest are scamming governments for trillions", "title": "Conspiracy of the plutocrats: Secrets of the wealth-inequality explosion revealed", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/zucman_piketty.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sean McElwee", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Economics, Editor's Picks, Gabriel Zucman, Inequality, tax evasion, Taxes, Thomas Piketty, Wealth inequality", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd25d9\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Economics, Editor's Picks, Gabriel Zucman, Inequality, tax evasion, Taxes, Thomas Piketty, Wealth inequality, News, Politics NewsThe growing wealth gap in developed countries is an incredibly disturbing development.\nIt seems the increase in wealth inequality has also coincided with an increase in debt inequality.\nI talked with one of the most luminous young economists on wealth inequality and how to fight it.\nBut even this data understates wealth inequality, argues Gabriel Zucman in \u201cThe Hidden Wealth of Nations,\u201d because official statistics fail to capture offshore wealth holdings.\nNow, $7.6 trillion I believe was the number that you came up with stashed in these offshore accounts."}
