His legs had almost stopped working because of pinched nerves in his spine.\n\nSuddenly, the Catholic Worker homeless shelter officially known as Isaiah House \u2013 a converted Craftsman-style mansion on Cypress Street that sleeps 40 homeless women each night and feeds an additional 200 homeless people three times a week at the Santa Ana Civic Center \u2013 had lost its moral, philosophical and spiritual heart.\n\n\u201cWhen you are going through one of the most horrific things in your life, and someone is there, that's the connection Dwight has with everyone,\u201d said Beverly Cunningham, 58, who recently moved out of Isaiah House after living there for nearly four years.\n\n\u201cWe were all really concerned,\u201d said Bobbie Simonelli, 56, describing how she and other Isaiah House guests felt when Smith entered Hoag this month. \u201cWe all just love him\u201d\n\nAs for Smith himself, the physical setbacks of hospitalization proved to be the least of his challenges.\n\n\u201cC.S. Lewis wrote about how people have all these vaunted spiritual ideas until they get a toothache,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a great leveler,\u201d he said about how his spinal condition has changed him. \u201cI'm willing to have people help pull my pants up.\u201d\n\nThe Smiths, who are Catholic, turned their backs on corporate careers to lead Isaiah House, where they live alongside the homeless they serve and earn so little income \u2013 a $10 weekly stipend \u2013 they qualify for indigent medical care.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nLeia Smith, 57, is the house manager. She coordinates volunteers, keeps accounts and attends to the myriad bureaucratic challenges that arise when caring for people on the margins of social institutions.\n\nDwight, Leia says, is the \u201csounding board,\u201d the one who lingers at meals talking to guests \u201cto hear what's on their hearts, what's hard for them.\u201d He is the one who reminds people they are still \u201cof value,\u201d she says.\n\nShe recalls waiting impatiently for Dwight to finish an hourlong conversation with a homeless man who appeared incoherent.\n\nLater, her husband told her \u201cthe guy was talking about his father's suicide.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat's why they call it \u2018Dwight's House,'\u201d she said. \u201cThey come here to talk to Dwight. They all do.\u201d\n\nThe Catholic Worker movement prioritizes radical solidarity with the poor, a value Dwight Smith never tires of emphasizing to guests, visitors and volunteers.\n\nHe's also been overheard lecturing wealthy donors about their debt to the poor. Two months ago, a class action lawsuit he helped to file secured a landmark settlement with the county of Orange, which agreed to overhaul its homeless services in response to claims that officials were improperly denying benefits.\n\nSo in recent months, when worsening scoliosis forced Smith to hobble around with a cane, people in the shelter took notice. And when he left the shelter for his surgeries, word of his absence spread quickly.\n\n\u201cThe people on the street don't have a person who's in their corner who's here, Leia Smith said. \u201cAnd that scares people.\u201d\n\nThe surgeries went well, and a few days later Dwight Smith was at a rehabilitation facility in Tustin. There, he underwent three therapy sessions a day and wasn't allowed to get up from bed by himself. \u201cI might fall over,\u201d he said.\n\nLeia kept Isaiah House guests apprised of Dwight's condition. But she didn't encourage them to visit Dwight because many homeless people \u201cdon't feel comfortable going\u201d to hospitals, where, she said, they're often stared at or asked to leave.\n\nThe guests, it turned out, had other ideas.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nBeverly Cunningham and a man named Salim, who comes to Sunday brunch at Isaiah House, tracked Dwight Smith down in the hospital. They showed up at his room unannounced \u2013 and, in Salim's case, after a long bus trip \u2013 to bring him get-well wishes from the community.\n\nOther homeless women pooled their money and time and bought Leia Smith a bouquet of flowers. They wrote messages in donated greeting cards.\n\nBobbie Simonelli, graced with an artistic streak, bought a 3-by-5-foot foam board at a 99-Cent Only store, cut the board into the shape of a Christmas tree and, with some help from other guests, decorated it with gold thread, shiny paper and plastic animal ornaments.\n\nCunningham took the card to Smith on Thursday. Simonelli said she made it because she was worried he \u201cwouldn't have anything for Christmas.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was hard not to cry to see him in the\u201d rehabilitation center, Cunningham said. \u201cI'm used to seeing him strong.\u201d\n\nSpeaking last week from his bed, Smith said he more than shared Cunningham's feelings.\n\n\u201cIt's a bizarre turnaround,\u201d he said. \u201cI'm thanking people and saying, \u2018You don't have to do that for me.' Finally I had to say, \u2018Just shut up, Dwight, and just be sick and let people do things for you for once.' \u201d\n\nAt the rehab facility, Smith learned to walk with a walker, navigate stairs, get in and out of bed, and prepare food without straining his spine, which is fused with bolts in places.\n\nOver the next few months, bone will solidify around the bolts and he'll be able to walk unassisted.\n\nUntil then, one fall could snap his back.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nOn Saturday, Leia picked up Dwight from rehab and drove him to the house.\n\nAs their car pulled up, they were surrounded by a receiving line of homeless women.\n\n\u201cI got out of the car and they were all worried about me, and I sat down and talked to them,\u201d Dwight said.\n\nHe's planning daily rehabilitative walks around the backyard and hopes to build up to a five-mile walk to Westfield MainPlace mall and back.\n\nHe probably won't make that trek alone.\n\n\u201cEveryone made a firm and solemn commitment to walk with me,\u201d he said.\n\nFor now, days are spent mostly in bed, since even sitting is painful. But that doesn't mean inactivity.\n\nOn Sunday, Smith rattled off a reading list that included comedian David Sedaris (\u201cvery sick but very funny\u201d) and a recently published theological study of the Gospel of Mark focusing on Jesus' political radicalism.\n\nThe day he returned from the hospital he was fielding questions from homeless women wondering whether they, too, should seek surgery for back conditions.\n\nAnd he's been on the phone with potential new guests, advising them whether to come to the house or seek better services elsewhere.\n\n\u201cThe poorest rich people on Earth are the ones who are sick,\u201d he said Sunday, musing on the ties that bind rich and poor when they confront mortality.\n\nBut then he got practical, reflecting that his hospitalization will help him give better advice to homeless people navigating the new federal health care law.\n\n\u201cI used to sign people up with the county,\u201d he said. \u201cBut now (we're) signing people up for CalOptima under the Affordable Care Act. It's a radical intervention to get poor people the care they need.\u201d\n\nContact the writer: jhinch@ocregister.com", "article_metadata": {"geo.region": "US-CA", "content_section": "life", "description": "Life: Helping the helpers | dwight, people, homeless, house, leia, guests, isaiah, cunningham, bed, poor", "geo.position": "33.745573;-117.867834", "author": "JIM HINCH", "og": {"site_name": "The Orange County Register", "description": "On the streets, they call it Dwight's House.", "title": "Helper finds support from those he's helped", "url": "http://www.ocregister.com/articles/dwight-594673-people-homeless.html", "image": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/gallery/myabts-b781238132z.120131223162005000g3v1hlnkr.1.jpg", "locale": "en-US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/gallery/myabts-b781238132z.120131223162005000g3v1hlnkr.1.jpg"}, "title": "Helper finds support from those he's helped", "description": "On the streets, they call it Dwight's House.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@ocregister"}, "publication_date": "2013-12-23", "content_author": "JIM HINCH", "fb": {"app_id": 107698536003308}, "content_thumbnail": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/thumb/myabts-b781238132z.120131223162005000g3v1hlnkr.1.jpg", "content_type": "article", "ICBM": "33.745573, -117.867834", "Keywords": "dwight, people, homeless, house, leia, guests, isaiah, cunningham, bed, poor", "geo.placename": "Santa Ana", "access-type": "free", "section": "life", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "content_title": "Helper finds support from those he's helped"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe6106\"", "article_summary": "\u2022 \u2022 \u2022Dwight Smith underwent surgeries at Hoag Hospital in Newport Beach to save his legs on Dec. 2 and 4.\n\u201cAnd that scares people.\u201dThe surgeries went well, and a few days later Dwight Smith was at a rehabilitation facility in Tustin.\n\u201cThe people on the street don't have a person who's in their corner who's here, Leia Smith said.\n\u201cWe were all really concerned,\u201d said Bobbie Simonelli, 56, describing how she and other Isaiah House guests felt when Smith entered Hoag this month.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022Beverly Cunningham and a man named Salim, who comes to Sunday brunch at Isaiah House, tracked Dwight Smith down in the hospital."}
