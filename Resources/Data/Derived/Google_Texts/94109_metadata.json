Hint: Most Americans are worse off than they were a long time ago.\n\nI started noticing voter anger around 2009. Initially, its locus was the Tea Party. They\u2019re the ones who would form a circle around a political event, holding hands, and start chanting expletives. I attributed this to the Tea Party\u2019s deep dissatisfaction with living in the 21st century. To them, basically, everything went south when Jane Wyatt stopped playing Robert Young\u2019s Stepford wife on Father Knows Best, and started playing Spock\u2019s mother, Amanda \u2026 Grayson, on Star Trek. (Does that mean that Spock and I are future relatives? I don\u2019t know.) For them, things have never been the same since.\n\nGenerally speaking, the problem for Team Blue is not anger; it\u2019s apathy. However, by roughly the year 2012, Team Blue had caught up in the Anger Games, and the score was tied.\n\nPolitically, we then entered very interesting territory. For many years up to that time, polling had showed that even when Congress had a negative approval rating, most voters wanted to reelect their individual members of Congress. (It\u2019s as though Congress had become Garrison Keilor\u2019s Lake Wobegon, where all the children are above average.) No more. Now polls showed a majority in favor of voting out one\u2019s own member of Congress, a matter quite unnerving to one\u2019s own member of Congress. Moreover, polls showed that most voters wished that voting booths offered a magic Shakespearean \u201clet\u2019s kill all the incumbents\u201d button that would let them throw out all the bums by extending a single digit. (The middle one, I surmise.) And speaking of digits, Congress\u2019s approval rating sank into single digits.\n\nWhy? Well, the superficial explanation is that voters feel that elected officials simply aren\u2019t listening. We had a good example of that a few weeks ago, on the Fast Track bill. A GOP member of Congress confided in me that his calls and emails were running 100-to-1 against Fast Track. In some Democratic offices, the numbers probably were even more one-sided. (Many of the people reading these very words had something to do with that.) Nevertheless, in the Party of the People, 13 Democratic Senators initially voted against proceeding with Fast Track, and then voted for proceeding with Fast Track. So that gutless anti-egalitarian bill slipped past a Senate filibuster with no votes to spare. Then, in the House, 28 Democratic Congressmen broke ranks, passing Fast Track by only four extra votes. (Meaning that if four votes had switched, Fast Track would have been halted in its \u2026 tracks.) From the voters\u2019 perspective, that\u2019s a very good example of \u201cyou\u2019re not listening to me!\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Life's getting harder. Incomes are declining.
