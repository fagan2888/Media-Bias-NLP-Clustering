It is my desire to do so now. However, this assault on the sanctity of human life takes me where I cannot go. I WILL NOT pay the surcharge for abortion services,\u201d he wrote.\n\nDobson said the amount of the surcharge is irrelevant.\n\n\u201cTo pay one cent for the killing of babies is egregious to me, and I will do all I can to correct a government that lies to me about its intentions and then tries to coerce my acquiescence with extortion. It would be a violation of my most deeply held convictions to disobey what I consider to be the principles in Scripture. The Creator will not hold us guiltless if we turn a deaf ear to the cries of His innocent babies. So come and get me if you must, Mr. President. I will not bow before your wicked regulation.\u201d\n\nAlready, Obamacare has been challenged three times before the Supreme Court. The first time the court ruled the law constitutional by defining its penalties for non-compliance as taxes. The second time, the justices struck the requirement to fund abortion for owners of closely held companies. Pending is a complaint arguing the administration is violating the law\u2019s requirement that subsidies be granted for people on state exchanges, not the federal exchange. Nearly three dozen states have refused to set up exchanges.\n\nAnalysts say a ruling based strictly on the language of the law could gut Obamacare\u2019s foundation.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "The legal fight over Obamacare\u2019s abortion-pill mandate has become more complicated.
