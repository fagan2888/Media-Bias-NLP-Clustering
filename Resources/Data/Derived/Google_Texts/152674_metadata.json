He fondly remembers schools closing so kids could watch Todd Lodwick and other hometown heroes compete in World Cup events at historic Howelsen Hill, where kids have learned ski jumping for 100 years.\n\nThe crowning achievement for U.S. nordic combined \u2014 a dual event involving ski jumping and cross country racing that has been part of the Olympic program since 1924 \u2014 came when the team won four medals at the 2010 Olympics and Bill Demong became an Olympic champion. That became Berend\u2019s goal.\n\n\u201cWhen I saw Bill win that gold medal, I knew, \u2018This is what I\u2019m doing,\u2019 \u201d said Berend, 19. \u201cI was so motivated. It was so cool to see someone who went through the same program as me succeed.\u201d\n\nOlympic glory is still his goal, but his dream took a body blow this past spring when the U.S. Ski Team cut funding to nordic combined. Coach Dave Jarrett informed Berend.\n\n\u201cI get a call from Dave saying: \u2018We got cut. We are not part of the U.S. Ski Team anymore,\u2019 \u201d Berend said. \u201cThat crushed me. My whole goal is, I want to be on the U.S. Ski Team.\u201d\n\nJarrett, a native of Denver and a two-time Olympian before he moved into coaching, had to make a lot of calls like that.\n\n\u201cThat was tough to explain to kids in Steamboat, kids in Park City (Utah),\u201d Jarrett said. \u201cParents were asking, \u2018Well, why wouldn\u2019t we just play soccer now?\u2019 \u201c\n\nThere are only three full-sized ski jumps in the U.S \u2014 in Steamboat, Park City and Lake Placid, N.Y. \u2014 which is one reason nordic combined finds itself in this predicament. There aren\u2019t a lot of athletes in the sport, maybe 500 in all.\n\nBut the news was heartbreaking in Steamboat, which has a rich tradition in nordic skiing and nurtured the nordic combined team in its worst-to-best development. Brothers Bryan and Taylor Fletcher of Steamboat form the core of the current elite team along with Demong, and Jarrett sees Berend as a talented prospect to join them.\n\nThe U.S. Ski and Snowboard Association always faces reduced budgets in post-Olympic years, forcing hard choices. As new snow sports are added to the Olympic program, the USSA gets stretched thinner. Its announced goal, \u201cBest in the World,\u201d means aiming to win the most medals in skiing and snowboarding at the Olympics, which it achieved in 2010. The U.S. finished second in Sochi this year to Norway.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s probably our main core challenge as a national team,\u201d said Luke Bodensteiner, vice president for athletics. \u201cCompared to the nations we aspire to compete against, we\u2019re financial underdogs in virtually every area we compete in. That forces us into a position where we\u2019ve got to make tough choices, and we\u2019ve got to be very clever and very specific about how we allocate out what are scarce resources.\u201d\n\nInitially, the USSA cut all support except $40,000 to fund travel for the Fletcher brothers this winter. Facing an outcry within the ski community, the USSA looked for ways to help nordic combined help itself.\n\nThe USSA advanced nordic combined $150,000 in the form of 15 Gold Passes \u2014 transferable ski passes good at any U.S. ski area for the 2014-15 season \u2014 but obligated nordic combined to recoup that $150,000 by selling the passes at $10,000 each.\n\nAs a result the top nordic combined athletes will be able to travel on the World Cup this season with coaches and ski technicians, and they will compete at the biennial world championships, but they spent much of the offseason pursuing sponsorships and soliciting donations in a fight for survival.\n\n\u201cWe are not only full-time athletes and coaches, but now also we\u2019ve become full-time fund- raisers,\u201d Jarrett said. \u201cThat is now the new reality. If we want to keep it going, it\u2019s completely up to us.\u201d\n\nDemong, who has won four medals at the world championships and two at the Olympics, courted potential sponsors in Europe last month. Being a five-time Olympian at age 34, he\u2019s back for another season in part to prevent the program\u2019s demise.\n\n\u201cThe only reason I\u2019m still around at this point is to make sure that there is a future,\u201d said Demong, who is running in Sunday\u2019s New York City Marathon. \u201cI spent a lot of my time this summer and fall fundraising, and have turned that focus the last month and a half toward trying to find viable, sustainable sponsorship.\n\n\u201cI feel partially indebted because I was given the opportunity to do something that allowed me to reach the pinnacle of my athletic career, probably the thing that will be put on my tombstone. That\u2019s the thing I want to be able to perpetuate. Looking back at this 10 years from now, I want to say I left the sport as good or better than I found it.\u201d\n\nJohn Meyer: 303-954-1616, jmeyer@denverpost.com or twitter.com/johnmeyer\n\nThe U.S. nordic combined program is endangered.
