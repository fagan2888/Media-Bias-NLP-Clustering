There are a few exceptions, like if you lose a job in the middle of the year, but as Adrianna McIntyre remarked, \u201cI accidentally burned my Obamacare card\u201d isn\u2019t one of them. David Hogberg, author of the NCPPR study says that\u2019s not a problem. \u201cA young person who gets a serious illness in June only has to wait until October to sign up for insurance and then wait until January 1 of the next year to receive coverage,\u201d he writes. But you can\u2019t exactly let a cancer metastasize for a few months or leave a bad injury untreated. And what about someone who gets that serious illness the day after the open enrollment period ends?\n\nAlas, never underestimate the ability of the left to take something out of context. What I was describing in that quote was a regulation known as \u201cguaranteed issue.\u201d As I wrote in the previous paragraph of my study, guaranteed issue (along with \u201ccommunity rating\u201d) \u201cgive young and healthy people big incentives to forgo insurance coverage altogether.\u201d As I wrote just a few paragraphs prior, if the exchanges don\u2019t attract enough young people, \u201cthey will eventually enter an insurance \u2018death spiral.\u2019\u201d It\u2019s pretty clear that I think it is a problem.\n\nI had previous experience with this when Jonathan Bernstein of the Washington Post accused me of ignoring the benefits of insurance and Brian Beutler of Salon accused me (indirectly) of encouraging young people to not purchase insurance. (Both wrong, see here.) Although I didn\u2019t see it until yesterday, Steve Benen at Rachel Maddow\u2019s Blog did something similar.\n\nSo, what gives? Are these pundits really missing the point of my study? Maybe, but a better explanation comes from reading Holland\u2019s full post, in which he states that the \u201chard-right is taking a scorched-earth approach, obstructing the law\u2019s implementation by any means necessary\u201d and \u201cthe right\u2019s war on ObamaCare is reaching such a fevered pitch.\u201d In other words, Holland\u2019s viewing just about anything related to ObamaCare, including the exchanges, through the lens of \u201chow conservatives are working to undermine the law.\u201d\n\nOne can also see this perspective in past posts of both Benen and Bernstein. Indeed, it goes a long way to explaining why they misunderstand\u2014if not outright distort\u2014my study. They view it as another conservative attempt to undermine the exchanges rather than an examination of the exchanges\u2019 flaws.\n\nThis perspective serves another purpose, that of providing a scapegoat for the left should the exchanges turn into a disaster.\n\nOne group that has really got the left\u2019s dander up is the Citizens\u2019 Council for Health Freedom. CCHF is pushing a \u201cRefuse to Enroll\u201d campaign that encourages people to refuse to buy insurance on the exchanges. While I don\u2019t think this is a good tactic, either morally or strategically, I suspect its impact will be small. Millions are apparently unaware of the subsidies offered on the exchange or how ObamaCare will effect them, according to CNN. Many more than that are surely unaware of CCHF\u2019s campaign, limiting its effectiveness. Nevertheless, Holland, Benen, et al, are hyping up CCHF\u2019s efforts, no doubt so that they can blame CCHF and other conservatives should young people fail to sign up for the exchanges.\n\nIf millions of young people fail to sign up for the exchanges it will be because (and this was the point of my study) of the incentives that the exchanges create for them. While the campaign from a conservative organization will have probably marginal impact at best, it will provide the left with a convenient scapegoat for ObamaCare\u2019s failures.\n\nPhoto: iStockphoto", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://www.conservativeblog.org/storage/HisFault.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1378314049708", "description": "Well, another leftist has missed the point of my recent study , &#8220;Why The &#8216;Youn...", "title": "ObamaCare Exchanges:  Prepping The\u00a0Scapegoats - Amy Ridenour's National Center Blog - A Conservative Blog"}, "blogburst-verify": "B9EORVLmLdD0z2JKwETUEmoZ", "Robots": "index,follow"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd5bc\"", "article_summary": "They view it as another conservative attempt to undermine the exchanges rather than an examination of the exchanges\u2019 flaws.\nThis perspective serves another purpose, that of providing a scapegoat for the left should the exchanges turn into a disaster.\nCCHF is pushing a \u201cRefuse to Enroll\u201d campaign that encourages people to refuse to buy insurance on the exchanges.\nIf millions of young people fail to sign up for the exchanges it will be because (and this was the point of my study) of the incentives that the exchanges create for them.\nMillions are apparently unaware of the subsidies offered on the exchange or how ObamaCare will effect them, according to CNN."}
