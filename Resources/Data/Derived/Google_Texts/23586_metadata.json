A family joke is that my first word was \u201cvote.\u201d The Church would later switch parties. Not me. On Tuesday I\u2019ll stand at the polls as I do every year and say that if Democrats win, people\u2019s lives will be better.\n\nEach year it\u2019s a harder case to make, even to other Democrats. Each year the middle class grows smaller, the democracy grows more corrupt and the chance of stopping global warming in time to save ourselves or our planet grows dimmer. You can\u2019t run forever on the slogan \u201cDie Slower! Vote Democratic!\u201d Time\u2019s running out on the democracy and the middle class, just as it is on global warming.\n\nIn the words of political upstarts everywhere, it\u2019s time for a change. If it comes, it will be from within the Democratic Party, or rather from the progressives who still reside there. But for all the talk of a \u201cpopulist revolt,\u201d progressives have yet to spark one. If Democrats win the Senate on Tuesday, that\u2019s unlikely to change. If they lose, progressives might wake up, which would be the best thing to happen to the Democrats in a long time. It may not feel like much consolation, but it\u2019s true.\n\nLet me be clear. There may be scant evidence of it lately, but it matters who runs the Senate. You don\u2019t throw away a race on a theory; who knows if even losing the Senate would be a shock sufficient to revive Democrats? But we do know our politics grows ever more vicious and empty and that we are in desperate need of serious political debate. We know Wall Street colonized the Democratic Party and the Democratic Party colonized the left, and that we\u2019ll have no such debate without a stronger, more independent progressive movement to help set its agenda.\n\nThis election has been an insult to democracy. The $4 billion spent on it has tightened the grip of the powerful without moving the needle on a single issue. Its ceaseless squalor has startled a public that thought politics hit rock bottom in the last election. The explosion of Super PAC and 527 \u201cdark money\u201d is one cause of it, but it only strengthened what is by now a 40-year trend.\n\nRail all you like against the Supreme Court or the Republicans. It isn\u2019t just them. If you ever gave money to a Democrat you get the emails that read like pleas from phishing \u201cfriends\u201d robbed in Majorca who need only your bank routing number to get home: \u201cBill, it\u2019s seconds till our filing deadline. Our extreme Tea Party opponent has Congressman Bob locked in a basement. They\u2019ve shot Fido. So much is at stake. Please send\u2026\u201d\n\nMost days that\u2019s all you get. October marked the first anniversary of the last government shutdown. Ashamed to find themselves tied with a party so recently found in the throes of lunacy, Democrats kept mum. They routinely fumble issues they once owned. Their spring crusade to raise the minimum wage petered out by fall. They can\u2019t talk about corruption on which they feast. They can\u2019t talk about climate because they shun topics that require any explanation. So they talk of saving the sensible center from extremists, a familiar line for being the central trope of the Obama administration and the very same promise Republicans make.\n\nDemocrats call the election historic but can\u2019t say why. It\u2019s hard to enlist people to an agenda you can\u2019t articulate, or make them care who runs a government that has stopped working. Voters see politics as a cesspool and Congress as a sideshow. So do progressives, yet they act as if the next Democrat in line will get us where we need to go. Here\u2019s some really good news: the merry-go-round on which they\u2019re trapped can\u2019t run without them. Not only can they get off, but if they do, it stops for good.\n\nRegardless of how Democrats do on Tuesday, many progressives will rush to hop on another horse. Someone should stop them. The time has come for progressives to hit the pause button on electoral politics, to take some time to reexamine their agenda, rethink their strategy and recognize their power. Some thoughts for them to ponder if they do:\n\nFocus First on Policy\n\nPolicy precedes message. First, figure out what you think, then how to tell people about it. By conflating these two sequential steps, or skipping the first altogether, Democrats have come to the place in which they find themselves: clueless, rudderless, unable to win an argument even with a Republican Party being piloted by angry juveniles.\n\nIn their years spent cohabiting with Democrats, progressives picked up many of their bad habits. One is an obsession with storytelling. Obama persists in believing that if only he were better at it, all his troubles would be over. But every vision needs a blueprint. Democrats used to get their blueprints from progressives. That was before progressives joined them in their endless hunt for the perfect savior and the perfect slogan.\n\nThis rule implies another: No more impulse shopping. Sad to say, it\u2019s the key lesson of the Obama experience. In our political ecosystem it\u2019s the progressives\u2019 role to hold Democrats to account. Engrossed as they are in picking winners, they do it poorly. They should stop acting like political consultants, which means no more tactical voting. I\u2019ve a hunch John Kerry won those late 2004 primaries because liberals who didn\u2019t like him looked at his r\u00e9sum\u00e9, his hair and his lantern jaw and thought someone else would. When the marketplace of ideas is consumed by second guessing, it becomes, like the stock market, just another casino.\n\nWhen progressives do their homework they\u2019ll know their bottom lines. Only then will they be able again to hold politicians\u2019 feet to the fire. When Obama quietly dumped the public option it should have been a deal breaker. When he decided in his first term to maintain radio silence on global warming, it too should have been a deal breaker. Instead, progressives let political consultants lecture them on the politics of the possible, as if oblivious to the stark truth that nearly all Obama\u2019s deepest wounds were self-inflicted in the name of pragmatism.\n\nThere\u2019s work to do and choices to make. Or we can wait for policy scraps like dogs at a kitchen door. We yearn for a president to tell us the truth about current global chaos: that our security doctrines are defunct, that militarism and unilateralism can\u2019t save us and that our safety lies in multilateral conflict resolution and the rule of law. It means reining in drone strikes, submitting with everyone else to international courts and fixing the U.N. Late in his life Ronald Reagan embraced elements of that agenda. There\u2019s no reason Obama can\u2019t, but he won\u2019t if we won\u2019t.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Democrats are going to lose the Senate.
