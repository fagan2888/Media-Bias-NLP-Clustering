Every few months, workers across the country take to the streets with picket signs to demand union rights and $15 per hour.\n\nNow, the union is looking to broaden its accusations of bad behavior, and is asking the FTC to update regulations governing the franchise business model.\n\n\u201cWe found another group of folks like the workers that are being abused by these big corporations,\u201d said Scott Courtney, SEIU\u2019s assistant to the president. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to get FTC to write new rules for a system that the big guys have rigged.\u201d\n\nFranchised businesses employ an estimated 9.1 million people and have consistently added jobs faster than non-franchised businesses in recent years, according to the petition. But unlike traditional small businesses, the SEIU said there\u2019s an imbalance of contractual power in the franchise business model that favors the corporate leadership and places individual operators in financially uncertain situations.\n\nCourtney said franchise owners put up their life savings to open stores, work 60 to 80 hours a week and take home $60,000 a year, if they\u2019re lucky.\n\nThe SEIU alleges in its petition that franchisors are retaliating against franchisee owners who criticize corporate business practices, unfairly terminating and refusing to renew franchise contracts, interfering when franchisees try to transfer or sell their stores and forcing franchisees to make unreasonably costly capital upgrades.\n\nIn its petition, the SEIU alleges that Quiznos, the financially troubled sandwich chain, disclosed sales data but not expenses or profitability figures to prospective franchisees in the 2000s to mask that 40 percent of its stores were failing to break even.\n\nQuiznos could not immediately be reached for comment on Monday.\n\nTo demonstrate unreasonable capital expenditures, the SEIU pointed to the lawsuit Wendy\u2019s filed against one of its franchisees in January. According to reports in the Baltimore Sun, the company sued because the franchisee refused to modernize its restaurants in Maryland, Virginia and the District of Columbia, remodels that the SEIU estimated would have cost $450,000 to $650,000 per store \u2014 about a third of a restaurant\u2019s average annual revenue.\n\nIn a statement, Wendy\u2019s spokesman Bob Bertini said the case is a legal matter that relates to a single franchisee in the Wendy\u2019s system and does not reflect the company\u2019s relationship with its broader franchise community.\n\n\u201cWe value the important relationships we have with franchisees and our shared interests in growing the Wendy\u2019s brand,\u201d he said. \u201cWe pride ourselves on the many long-term franchise relationships we have, and we work to resolve franchisee questions or concerns about the brand vision through a variety of forums.\u201d\n\nThe SEIU accuses McDonald\u2019s of unfairly not renewing contracts and intervening in franchise sales.\n\nOne former franchisee, the group said, alleged in bankruptcy filings that McDonald\u2019s repeatedly interfered with offers to buy his stores to force him to sell to the company\u2019s preferred buyer at a significantly reduced price.\n\nIn a statement, McDonald\u2019s said the SEIU is merely trying to add to its membership rolls.\n\n\u201cThis action is driven by a union-financed campaign that has targeted the McDonald\u2019s brand,\u201d the company said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s ironic that this organization, that has spent more than $80 million during the past two years to disrupt operations of these same businessmen and women, is now appealing to them for an alliance.\u201d\n\nFTC spokesman Frank Dorman said the agency does not release information about investigations. Franchisees, however, are within the agency\u2019s jurisdiction, he said, because the FTC enforces the franchise rule.\n\nThe rule dictates what information franchisors are required to give prospective franchisees, including the projected costs of entering into the business, the legal obligations of the parties, statistics on company-owned outlets and audited financial information.\n\nThe International Franchise Association said the FTC\u2019s franchise rule has stood as a strong defense against abuses for almost 40 years.\n\n\u201cOnce again, the Service Employees International Union is manufacturing a crisis as part of its increasingly expensive public relations campaign, now estimated to be more than $33 million, to destroy the time-tested franchise model in order to fill its own depleted membership,\u201d IFA President and CEO Steve Caldeira, said in a statement Monday.\n\n\u201cFranchisees are highly satisfied, they have a high level of trust in their franchisors and they know they have remedies in places through their mutually-agreed upon contract, through the courts and through many state laws if and when issues may arise between two parties,\u201d he added.\n\nThis story was updated at 7:21 p.m.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The union group alleges that a number of franchisors are abusing franchisees.", "description": "The union group alleges that a number of franchisors are abusing franchisees.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Lydia Wheeler", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The union group alleges that a number of franchisors are abusing franchisees.", "title": "Labor group escalates fight against fast food", "url": "http://thehill.com/regulation/242368-seiu-calls-on-ftc-to-investigate-the-franchise-industry", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/fightfor15.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:39-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/regulation/242368-seiu-calls-on-ftc-to-investigate-the-franchise-industry", "dcterms.date": "2015-05-18T11:01-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Lydia Wheeler", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Franchises, Corporate crime, Franchising, Service Employees International Union, Federal Trade Commission, Franchise Rule, Labor, Business,,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-18T11:01:27-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/regulation/242368-seiu-calls-on-ftc-to-investigate-the-franchise-industry", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The union group alleges that a number of franchisors are abusing franchisees.", "card": "summary", "title": "Labor group escalates fight against fast food"}, "dcterms.title": "Labor group escalates fight against fast food"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd5442\"", "article_summary": "Now, the union is looking to broaden its accusations of bad behavior, and is asking the FTC to update regulations governing the franchise business model.\nThe action is the latest salvo in an increasingly nasty fight between unions and the fast-food industry.\nThe Service Employees International Union (SEIU) filed a petition Monday with the Federal Trade Commission seeking an investigation of the alleged practices at 14 major chains, including McDonald\u2019s, Wendy\u2019s and Quiznos.\nTo demonstrate unreasonable capital expenditures, the SEIU pointed to the lawsuit Wendy\u2019s filed against one of its franchisees in January.\nEvery few months, workers across the country take to the streets with picket signs to demand union rights and $15 per hour."}
