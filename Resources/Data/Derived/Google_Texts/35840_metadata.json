Obamacare is the most outspoken example of this. Education is another topic where the GOP has opposed federal interference with what the party considers a 10th Amendment issue.\n\nIt seems that gambling, something always considered to fall under states\u2019 rights, has left the Republican Party contradicting itself.\n\nSenator Lindsey Graham has repeatedly published his opposition to Obamacare, often calling healthcare a state issue. He even created the website Optoutsc.com that promotes an agenda \u201cto allow states to opt-out of Obamacare\u201d.\n\nSenator Graham also opposes Common Core, the successor of No Child Left Behind. This program attempts to get all states on the same level of education standards. In a press release announcing a resolution introduced by Senator Graham, he is quoted:\n\nIn effect it is trying to force states into accepting a one-size-fits-all approach. This coercion with Common Core is another example of the federal government trampling on states\u2019 rights.\n\nThis is humorous considering Senator Graham is trying to force states into a \u201cone-size-fits-all approach\u201d when it comes to gambling regulation, something historically left up to the states.\n\nLindsey defends this by saying, in a press release:\n\nIn 1999, South Carolina outlawed video poker and removed over 33,000 video poker machines from within its borders. Now, because of the Obama Administration\u2019s decision, virtually any cell phone or computer can again become a video poker machine. It\u2019s simply not right.\n\nSouth Carolina had a video gaming industry that was repugnant in almost every way. It was built on \u201clies, legal chicanery, and just plain crime\u201d, according to an article published by Slate during that era.\n\nSouth Carolina was littered with eyesores that were loosely described as casinos. The Obama Administration did not do anything to force South Carolina to bring back those machines, it only gave states the right to regulate online gaming, an industry that already exists through offshore entities. Graham\u2019s commentary seems to suggest that he does not understand the difference or that states have the right to control and regulated gaming.\n\nSenator Graham was the beneficiary of campaign contributions and a fundraiser from Sheldon Adelson.\n\nGovernors Jumping on the Bandwagon\n\nSeveral governors have decided that they do not support the rights of state governments as it pertains to gambling. These governors are also members of the Republican Party.\n\nLouisiana Governor Bobby Jindal\n\nLouisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal started it all with an op-ed at Businessreport.com. We addressed his misguided thoughts here. While Gov. Jindal wants the feds to take away a state\u2019s right to regulate online gambling, he opposes Obamacare on 10th Amendment grounds. He also did not appreciate the Justice Department\u2019s challenge of his state\u2019s school voucher system.\n\nIt has been widely reported that Gov. Jindal is considering a 2016 presidential run.\n\nTexas Governor Rick Perry\n\nTexas Gov. Rick Perry wrote a letter to Congress stating that he does not feel states are capable of regulating online gambling. Without citing any examples, and showing a complete misunderstanding as to what the job of the DOJ is, Perry claims:\n\nWhen gambling occurs in the virtual world, the ability of states to determine whether the activity should be available to its citizens and under what conditions \u2013 and to control the activity accordingly \u2013 is left subject to the vagaries of the technical marketplace. This seriously compromises the ability of states to control gambling within their borders.\n\nTexas is no expert on this topic. It has never experimented with regulating online gaming \u2013 not even horse racing \u2013 and it does not have commercial casinos or online lottery ticket sales. Gov. Perry seems to think that since his state has never entered the marketplace, nobody should have the opportunity.\n\nThis is an interesting position considering Gov. Perry has been vocal about states\u2019 right as they pertain to Obamacare and marijuana, among other issues.\n\nPerry told an audience at the 2014 Conservative Political Action Committee that the federal government should \u201cGet out of the healthcare business, get out of education\u201d. Perry also told the audience:\n\nThe vision that wins out \u2014 either this big-government, protectionist nanny state version offered by liberal leaders or the limited-government, unsubsidized, freedom state offered by conservative leaders \u2014 will determine the future of our nation.\n\nIt would seem that a nanny state is only OK on topics approved by Gov. Perry. He ran in the 2012 Republican primary. It is believed that he will give it another try in 2016.\n\nFlorida Governor Rick Scott\n\nFlorida Gov. Rick Scott spoke out against online gambling last week calling for a federal ban. This goes against his campaign promise of fighting for states\u2019 rights by suing the federal government to limit its influence. Gov. Scott rejected Common Core, citing \u201cthe Federal government has no constitutional authority to unilaterally set academic standards for Florida\u201d.\n\nOnce again we have a governor that will not hesitate to accuse the federal government of trampling on states\u2019 rights, while at the same time calling on Congress to do the same on a different topic that does not affect his state.\n\nFlorida already has one form of legalized online gambling. Citizens may wager on horse races over the Internet via TVG. This form of online gambling is protected by the current federal bill seeking a ban on most forms of online gambling.\n\nGov. Scott\u2019s PAC received a $250,000 check from Sheldon Adelson in 2012.\n\nStates\u2019 Rights and Internet Gambling\n\nEvery state has the right to determine whether online gambling is the right fit for its citizens without interference from the federal government. It is not appropriate for GOP governors in the South to try and force their beliefs and those of their contributors onto others across the country.\n\nResidents, legislators and governors in Delaware, Nevada and New Jersey have decided that online gambling is appropriate within those borders. Other states have determined online lottery ticket sales and horse racing should be legal and regulated. Many states have agreed online gambling is not appropriate. The key here is that the states decided, not the federal government.\n\nIf a state decides that online gambling should not be legal then that is its right. Congress does not have the right to take that choice away from states. Governors that cite states\u2019 rights for their opposition to Obamacare and Common Core, while at the same time calling for a federal ban on other states\u2019 rights, are hypocrites.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Several GOP politicians are support a federal online gambling ban that violates states' rights.", "og": {"description": "Several GOP politicians are support a federal online gambling ban that violates states' rights.", "title": "GOP Hypocritical Online Gambling Position Contradicts States' Rights Platform -", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 320, "identifier": "http://cdn.uspoker.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/republican.gif", "height": 240}, "updated_time": "2014-04-07T16:27:17-07:00", "url": "http://www.uspoker.com/blog/gop-hypocritical-online-gambling-position/7819/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Several GOP politicians are support a federal online gambling ban that violates states' rights.", "title": "GOP Hypocritical Online Gambling Position Contradicts States' Rights Platform -", "image": "http://cdn.uspoker.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/republican.gif", "creator": "@John_Mehaffey", "site": "@uspoker", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/uspoker", "section": "Editorial", "published_time": "2014-04-07T16:26:19-07:00", "modified_time": "2014-04-07T16:27:17-07:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda975\"", "article_summary": "GOP Hypocritical Online Gambling Position Contradicts States\u2019 Rights Platform John Mehaffey Apr.07, 2014 4:26:PMThe Republican Party has demonstrated how important states\u2019 rights are.\nThis form of online gambling is protected by the current federal bill seeking a ban on most forms of online gambling.\nResidents, legislators and governors in Delaware, Nevada and New Jersey have decided that online gambling is appropriate within those borders.\nIt seems that gambling, something always considered to fall under states\u2019 rights, has left the Republican Party contradicting itself.\nGovernors that cite states\u2019 rights for their opposition to Obamacare and Common Core, while at the same time calling for a federal ban on other states\u2019 rights, are hypocrites."}
