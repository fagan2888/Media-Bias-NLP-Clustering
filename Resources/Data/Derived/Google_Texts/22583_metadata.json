The Rockies won 12-2.\n\nThe 6-foot-3, 210-pound outfielder out of Georgia Tech said he had never had a four-hit game, let alone getting six hits in a game. He said on his double in the sixth inning he was watching the ball too much and nearly missed first base. He may have otherwise stretched that hit into a triple, which would have completed the cycle.\n\n\u201cI thought we played really good baseball today,\u201d he said, deflecting attention. \u201cJuan (Nicasio) pitched well.\u201d\n\nAaron Miles held the previous record for most hits in a Rockies home opener with five, set in 2005.\n\nBlackmon had endured a slow start during spring training, but was ultimately kept with five other outfielders on the Rockies\u2019 opening-day roster. Manager Walt Weiss had said March wasn\u2019t a tryout camp or an \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d audition, weighing Blackmon\u2019s better second half of last season as part of the equation.\n\nPhotos: Colorado Rockies rout Diamondbacks 12-2 in home opener\n\nWeiss said after the game that while he likely played in Galarraga\u2019s six-hit game, he didn\u2019t remember it until someone reminded about it.\n\nThe last player to get six hits was the White Sox\u2019s Alex Rios on July 10, 2013, against the Detroit Tigers. He tied both a club and American League record with the feat, hitting a triple and five singles.\n\nThe last player in the National League to get six hits in a nine-inning game was Adrian Gonzalez for the San Diego Padres on Aug. 11, 2009. Two other players, Ian Kinsler for the Texas Rangers, and Freddy Sanchez for the Pittsburgh Pirates, also did it that year.\n\nFormer Pittsburgh Pirate Rennie Stennett remains the only player since 1900 \u2014 Major League Baseball\u2019s modern era \u2014 to get seven hits in one nine-inning game, going 7-for-7 on Sept. 16, 1975, against the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field. There have been 70 six-hit games in baseball\u2019s modern era, 30 of them in the National League.\n\nDaniel Petty: 303-954-1081, dpetty@denverpost.com or twitter.com/danielpetty", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Charlie Blackmon first Rockies player since 1995 to go 6-for-6 in game", "title": "Charlie Blackmon first Rockies player since 1995 to go 6-for-6 in game", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/04/04/charlie-blackmon-first-rockies-player-since-1995-to-go-6-for-6-in-game/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140404__rockies-blackmon-single-opener-040414p1-1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140404__rockies-blackmon-single-opener-040414p1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-04-04T17:26:05+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T00:13:59+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Charlie Blackmon on Friday became the second player in Colorado Rockies history to go 6-for-6 in a nine-inning game, tying the mark set by Andres Galarraga against the Houston Astros on July 3, 1995.\nPhotos: Colorado Rockies rout Diamondbacks 12-2 in home openerWeiss said after the game that while he likely played in Galarraga\u2019s six-hit game, he didn\u2019t remember it until someone reminded about it.\nThe 6-foot-3, 210-pound outfielder out of Georgia Tech said he had never had a four-hit game, let alone getting six hits in a game.\nThe last player in the National League to get six hits in a nine-inning game was Adrian Gonzalez for the San Diego Padres on Aug. 11, 2009.\nBlackmon finished the game \u2014 Colorado\u2019s home opener against the Arizona Diamondbacks \u2014 with one home run, three doubles, two singles and five RBIs."}
