(Sioux City, IA) Sam Clovis, candidate for the U.S. Senate, remarked today that “It is a shame when an elected official votes against his constituency just to stand with the President.” He continued by saying that Braley has now essentially voted to shut the government down and to authorize millions of dollars to fund a program that, in the end, will pass increased costs on to each and every taxpayer. “A majority of Iowans do not want Obamacare, and he literally voted against them.”

“Bruce Braley voted ‘no’ on the Government Funding Resolution that would extend the government’s spending authority until December,” said Clovis. “With his ‘no’ vote, Bruce Braley is saying that he does not want to consider a compromise so that government employees, veterans and social security recipients will receive their checks.”

The Continuing Resolution as passed by the House of Representatives would defund Obamacare. “This is good for Iowans,” said Clovis. “As I have traveled the state, what I hear from voters is that they do not want Obamacare and they do not want their taxes raised. Bruce Braley is not listening to these voters. He is listening to Barack Obama and that is not acceptable to the voters of Iowa.”

Sam Clovis is running for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Sen.Tom Harkin. Sam holds a MBA in Management and a Doctorate in Public Administration. He is currently a tenured full professor at a private liberal arts college in northwest Iowa. He served in the United States Air Force for 25 years and still provides leadership to defense and homeland security institutions. He lives in Hinton, IA with his wife Charlotte and stepson Khan.
