Owners of the first approved recreational marijuana stores in Denver can start picking up their licenses Friday morning.

The Denver Department of Excise and Licenses, located at 201 W. Colfax Avenue, will distribute the approved licenses beginning at 8 a.m., according to a news release from the City and County of Denver.

As of Monday, 42 businesses had completed the licensing process and can receive their city license to open on Jan. 1. Those businesses include retail stores, grow facilities and stores that sell pot-infused products.

Retail marijuana stores must obtain both a state and local license before they open.

The city started accepting applications for retail marijuana stores on Oct. 1.
