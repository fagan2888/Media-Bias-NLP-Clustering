Hundreds of Greensboro residents have gathered in the courtyard of the city\u2019s government complex to encourage their friends, neighbors and anyone else they know to vote.\n\nAmber Matthews, a 22-year-old woman with a forceful matter-of-fact voice, is there to share her story.\n\nShe is raising her five-year-old daughter and barely making ends meet working two minimum-wage jobs in the fast food industry.\n\n\u201cMy voice is just a whisper, but when we come together, we can be heard,\u201d she tells the crowd.\n\nAfter the rally, she spoke with ThinkProgress at her small, sparse apartment 5 minutes from downtown.\n\n\u201cI work two jobs, I shouldn\u2019t have to be struggling,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I still struggle.\u201d\n\nMatthews has worked at a Wendy\u2019s for the last four years, and at a nearby Arby\u2019s for the last two. Between the two jobs, she brings in about $600 every two weeks, barely enough to afford her $550 per month apartment, utility and food expenses, and the costs of raising a quickly-growing daughter.\n\n\u201cBetween my bills and her, she\u2019s constantly growing, so I constantly have to buy her clothes, shoes,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know she\u2019s a typical kid, she loses things on a regular basis. Like last year, we bought her like a hundred hats.\u201d\n\nMatthews is caught in the coverage gap in North Carolina, not making enough to put away savings but earning too much to qualify for more than a few dollars a month in food stamps. Naturally, she can\u2019t afford health care either.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t qualify for Medicaid,\u201d said Matthews. \u201cI applied for Medicaid when I was working at just Wendy\u2019s, and they told me I make too much money.\u201d\n\nThat quickly became a problem. \u201cMy daughter, she had started Pre-k and she broke out with scabies,\u201d she said, a highly contagious skin disease that often affects young children and can quickly spread throughout schools. She brought her daughter to the hospital for treatment, but contracted the disease herself.\n\n\u201cWhen I went to the doctors, my medicine was $200,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m still in debt from that. I can\u2019t get healthcare that I need because I\u2019m a working mother working two jobs.\u201d\n\nHealth care is a huge issue in the state\u2019s midterm election. Senate candidate Thom Tillis (R) has served as the speaker of the state\u2019s House of Representatives since 2011, and led Republicans\u2019 efforts to block Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act. Tillis has campaigned heavily on his opposition to Obamacare as unaffordable, calling the program \u201ca disaster\u201d in a last-minute campaign ad hitting incumbent Kay Hagan (D-NC) for her support of the bill.\n\nMatthews has little patience for politicians who talk about issues they haven\u2019t personally experienced.\n\n\u201cThese people don\u2019t understand the struggle, but then they sit here and say they care about the people,\u201d she said. \u201cHow do you care about the people if you\u2019re hurting the people?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand why you would say \u2018I don\u2019t want to raise the minimum wage for this person\u2019 when you know it\u2019s a struggle\u2026Have you ever had to choose between your lights and food? Have you ever had to make the choice between having heat in your house and feeding your child?\n\nMatthews and a small group of about a dozen people traveled to the state capital in Raleigh to try and explain all of this to Speaker Tillis in person.\n\n\u201cHe never showed,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "\"These people don't understand the struggle, but then they sit here and say they care about the people,\" she said. \"How do you care about the people if you're hurting the people?\"", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "\"These people don't understand the struggle, but then they sit here and say they care about the people,\" she said. \"How do you care about the people if you're hurting the people?\"", "title": "22-Year-Old Mother Working Two Jobs Blasts Lawmakers Who Oppose Raising The Minimum Wage", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2014/11/04/3588573/meet-amber-matthews-a-22-year-old-mother-working-two-minimum-wage-jobs/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/amber_matthews.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"These people don't understand the struggle, but then they sit here and say they care about the people,\" she said. \"How do you care about the people if you're hurting the people?\"", "creator": "@AdamReports", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/amber_matthews-321x214.jpg", "title": "22-Year-Old Mother Working Two Jobs Blasts Lawmakers Who Oppose Raising The Minimum Wage", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-politics", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/amber_matthews.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/amber_matthews.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-04T11:41:24+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbd74\"", "article_summary": "Politics 22-Year-Old Mother Working Two Jobs Blasts Lawmakers Who Oppose Raising The Minimum Wage CREDIT: Amber Matthews with her daughter Latia (left) and niece Nana.\nShe is raising her five-year-old daughter and barely making ends meet working two minimum-wage jobs in the fast food industry.\nI can\u2019t get healthcare that I need because I\u2019m a working mother working two jobs.\u201dHealth care is a huge issue in the state\u2019s midterm election.\nAmber Matthews, a 22-year-old woman with a forceful matter-of-fact voice, is there to share her story.\n\u201cThese people don\u2019t understand the struggle, but then they sit here and say they care about the people,\u201d she said."}
