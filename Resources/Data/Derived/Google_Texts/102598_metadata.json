But it faces tangible challenges signing up millions of people over a shorter time period, while Republicans in Congress renew their call for the law's repeal. The administration dramatically cut 2015 enrollment expectations this week to 9.1 million people, from 13 million.\n\nEnroll America officials say the larger pot of money last year included donations to help with start-up costs and said it expects to reach 1.4 million consumers in person or by phone in 11 states.\n\nThe group reached about 927,000 people through those avenues last time and expects to surpass the 5 million total that it claims to have reached for 2014 coverage through additional routes including email, social media and partner organizations.\n\n\u201cWe have the resources to get it done,\u201d Enroll America President Anne Filipic told reporters.\n\nFilipic pointed to two new high-tech products including an online \"Get Covered Connector\" tool to help interested consumers talk to specialists who can help them enroll in coverage, and a special database for locating uninsured people.\n\nThe group, which boasts more than 4,600 partner organizations, said the two products have been adopted by allied outreach groups in an additional 11 states, bringing the effort's total marketing reach to 22 states.\n\n(Reporting by David Morgan; Editing by David Gregorio)",
