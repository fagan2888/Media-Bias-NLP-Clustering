The connections between depression, substance abuse and suicide were examined by the American media like never before.\n\nIn Indian country the connections had already been painfully obvious. The especially high suicide rates among Native Americans, compared to the rest of the U.S. population, are well documented. On some reservations and villages, the rates can be up to 10 times higher than the national average.\n\nBut even within tribal communities there is a need for depression to be studied more in depth. Reports show that 90 percent of people who kill themselves intentionally have clinical depression or a diagnosable mental disorder. Many times people who die by suicide have an alcohol or substance abuse problem as well.\n\n\u201cDepression and suicide are definitely linked,\u201d said Ivan Posey, current Business Council member and former Chairman of the Eastern Shoshone Tribe on the Wind River reservation in Wyoming. \u201cIf someone doesn\u2019t feel good about themselves it encourages them a little more to take their own life. I think most of the suicides that I can talk about from a personal and family viewpoint are substance abuse and alcohol related.\u201d\n\nThe harsh living conditions on many reservations and villages have consistently been a focal point of the high suicide rates among Native American youth. The high percentage of families living below the poverty line, the isolation in which many reservations and villages are located, the high rates of alcoholism, unemployment and historical trauma have all been highlighted as reasons for the suicide epidemic that still exists.\n\n\u201cThere are layers and layers of why people commit suicide. It might be because of depression, but it might be because of other factors, such as bullying to excess,\u201d explained Mary Kim Titla of the San Carlos Apache Tribe in Arizona, who serves as Executive Director of United National Indian Tribal Youth (UNITY). \u201cThere could be a history of mental abuse or sexual abuse. There are many warning signs we have to look out for, like people talking about taking their own lives.\u201d\n\nMany mental health officials underline that a family history of depression is common among persons with this potentially life-threatening mood disorder that affects at least 1 in 6 Americans, or 17 million people, each year.\n\n\u201cThere is a cycle that tends to evolve in poverty cultures; poverty, substance abuse, and dysfunction,\u201d said Titla, who gained notoriety for her years as an award-winning reporter/anchor for the NBC-TV affiliate in Phoenix. \u201cI grew up on an Indian reservation (San Carlos) and it was in a rural, isolated setting. It wasn\u2019t so much the isolated setting that affected me, but rather it was the dysfunction that I was surrounded by that affected me.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome families may be more susceptible to depression depending on the conditions and lifestyle they were raised within,\u201d said Posey, who serves as Chairman of the Montana-Wyoming Tribal Leaders Council. \u201cSome instances or cases show that (some) young people can rise above (depressing conditions), while others show that severe depression stays and people attempt taking their lives and do take their lives. But I think there\u2019s a danger in exposing these issues to grade school children. It\u2019s a very gray area.\u201d\n\nHealth experts point out that persistent ignorance about depression and misperceptions of it by the public, and even some health providers, as a personal weakness or failing that can be willed or wished away lead to painful stigmatization of and avoidance of the diagnosis by many persons who are affected by the disease.\n\n\u201cThere are many things that can cause depression. It might be a life event,\u201d said Titla, who stressed that she is not a health expert. \u201cWhat causes the anxiety? Obviously, there has to be a feeling of some sort of insurmountable pain or feeling of hopelessness. There is certainly a sense of loss. We have to research the factors and pressures when it comes to depression and feeling hopeless \u2013 and you feel like there\u2019s nowhere to turn.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Suicide rates among Native Americans is especially high showing a need for more in depth studying to be done on the depression and suicide.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "kpolisse", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/10/19/suicide-reservations-and-need-more-studies-157417", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/suicide_and_depression_-_thinkstock.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Suicide on Reservations and the Need for More Studies"}, "dcterms.date": "2014-10-19T10:51-04:00", "dc": {"title": "Suicide on Reservations and the Need for More Studies"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/10/19/suicide-reservations-and-need-more-studies-157417", "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Harlan McKosato, Suicide, Robin Williams, Ivan Posey, Mary Kim Titla, Native American Youth, Depression, UNITY, United National Indian Tribal Youth, Mental Health", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.title": "Suicide on Reservations and the Need for More Studies"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd5ae9\"", "article_summary": "The especially high suicide rates among Native Americans, compared to the rest of the U.S. population, are well documented.\nThe connections between depression, substance abuse and suicide were examined by the American media like never before.\nMany times people who die by suicide have an alcohol or substance abuse problem as well.\nOn some reservations and villages, the rates can be up to 10 times higher than the national average.\nBut even within tribal communities there is a need for depression to be studied more in depth."}
