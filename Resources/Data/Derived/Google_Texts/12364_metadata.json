One can think (as many do) that Obamacare, Dodd-Frank and the CFPB, DADT repeal, fuel emission standards, $800 billion stimulus, sunsetting some Bush tax cuts, dropping defense of DOMA, the auto bailout, Lily Ledbetter, student loan reform, the START treaty, and Race to the Top are all bad policy\u2014but they are achievements. In addition, Obama not only passed them, but managed to win reelection, something Jimmy Carter (a frequent comparison Todd makes) failed to do. Yes, there were other significant items on the liberal agenda, but when stacked up against the landmarks of that skilled schmoozer and frenemy specialist Bill Clinton, the diagnosis of Obama\u2019s flaws looks overblown.\u201d\n\nStill, critics point out that under the President\u2019s tenure, Democrats have lost 70 seats in the House and conceded control of the Senate to Republicans, who are coming off all-time lows in favorability ratings. Also, recent videos of the Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber stating that American voters were \u201cstupid\u201d and that \u201clack of transparency works to our advantage\u201d on passing the law, has damaged the President\u2019s signature domestic achievement.\n\nWith the U.S. Supreme Court also agreeing to take up a toothy Conservative challenge that would end Obamacare subsidies for millions of people in 2015, that achievement\u2019s future could be in question.\n\nDo you think Chuck Todd is right in calling the President \u201carrogant\u201d?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Chuck Todd, host of Meet the Press, sat down with Conan O'Brien this week to discuss President Obama and some of the criticisms he makes of the Commander-in", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "Chuck Todd, host of Meet the Press, sat down with Conan O\u2019Brien this week to discuss President Obama and some of the criticisms he makes of the Commander-in", "title": "Chuck Todd: \u2018Obama\u2019s Arrogance Got The Better Of Him\u2019", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/1609373/chuck-todd-obamas-arrogance-got-the-better-of-him/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Chuck-Todd-Thinks-Obamas-Arrogance-Got-The-Better-Of-Him.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-14T13:19:57+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-14T21:29:06+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Chuck-Todd-Thinks-Obamas-Arrogance-Got-The-Better-Of-Him.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2014-11-14T13:19:57+00:00", "fb": {"pages": 71179904752, "app_id": 164157850314499}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "chuck todd,conan o\\'brien,meet the press,obama\\'s arrogance,president obama,politics", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Chuck-Todd-Thinks-Obamas-Arrogance-Got-The-Better-Of-Him.jpg", "width": 670, "height": 409}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Chuck Todd, host of Meet the Press, sat down with Conan O\u2019Brien this week to discuss President Obama and some of the criticisms he makes of the Commander-in"}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "article_summary": "Still, left-leaning sites like The Daily Beast take issue with the assessment that Chuck Todd makes in The Stranger.\nDo you think Chuck Todd is right in calling the President \u201carrogant\u201d?\nIn addition, Obama not only passed them, but managed to win reelection, something Jimmy Carter (a frequent comparison Todd makes) failed to do.\nChuck Todd, host of Meet the Press, sat down with Conan O\u2019Brien this week to discuss President Obama and some of the criticisms he makes of the Commander-in-Chief in his new book, The Stranger.\nColumnist William O\u2019Connor calls it a \u201clousy Obama takedown.\u201d\u201cTime and again, the author confuses chattering class dissatisfaction with an honest assessment of accomplishment."}
