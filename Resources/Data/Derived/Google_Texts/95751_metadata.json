Indeed, Grayson should strive to comport himself with at least the modicum of decorum that Internet phenom and 9/11 truther Alex Jones has managed while having Grayson on his show.\n\nGrayson is in the news now for two reasons. First, that he says he\u2019s seriously contemplating a Senate bid. The second is a nasty divorce he\u2019s working through with the mother of his five children. Married in 1990, the two had been working on a settlement but a court appearance this week ended poorly. \"I'll sum it up for you,\u201d explained Grayson to local TV reporters immediately after the proceeding. \u201cGold diggers gotta dig. That's all I gotta say.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s not his unseemly statements about his personal affairs that are particularly troubling. He shouldn\u2019t be talking like that, of course, but neither should the press be particularly interested in the personal lives of politicians unless criminality is involved or the matter at hand is directly relevant to their elected office.\n\nNo, it\u2019s really the way Grayson talks in the strictly political sphere that is most troubling. In the early 1990s, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan famously complained that the country was \u201cdefining deviancy down.\u201d The problem, Moynihan argued, was that \u201cwe have been redefining deviancy so as to exempt much conduct previously stigmatized, and also quietly raising the \u2018normal\u2019 level in categories where behavior is now abnormal by any earlier standard.\u201d\n\nI actually don\u2019t buy Moynihan\u2019s large argument (much of what he considered deviant, we now rightly recognize as individuality, fashion, or simple expression), but I think his phrase is useful when discussing how politicians act and talk. We put up with a lot more crap from pols than we used to and that tolerance is not leading either to better outcomes or deeper discussions of important topics.\n\nAs the self-styled \u201cCongressman With Guts,\u201d Grayson has yet to reach bottom when it comes to throwing low blows. In 2009, for instance, while appearing on Jones\u2019 show and talking about the Federal Reserve, he called Linda Robertson, an adviser to Ben Bernanke, \u201ca K Street whore.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere I am,\u201d he inveighed, \u201cthe only member of Congress who actually worked as an economist, and this lobbyist, this K Street whore, is trying to teach me about economics.\u201d\n\nPerhaps Grayson was just nervous in his freshman year in Congress and trying to show off a bit too much. That same year he turned in the performance for which he is probably still best-known: his executive summary of the Republican health care plan alternative to Obamacare as \u201cIf you get sick, America, the Republican health care plan is this: Die quickly.\u201d He delivered that message, complete with props, from the floor of Congress.\n\nIn a tough 2010 re-election campaign, Grayson ran ads calling his Republican opponent, Daniel Webster, a draft dodger and, more improbably, \u201cTaliban Dan,\u201d in a nod to Webster\u2019s social conservatism. Factually incorrect and overflowing with duplicitous editing, the commercials are pitch-perfect parodies of negative ads and are widely believed to have helped cost Grayson the election. Florida voters, accustomed as they are to reading about \u201cFlorida Man,\u201d don\u2019t always want his spiritual cousin representing them in Congress (Grayson would return to Washington in 2013, representing a newly redrawn 9th district).\n\nI\u2019m about as far from good-government types who bemoan the death of civil discourse as you can get (in fact, just recently I published a piece headlined \u201cClinton Aide Sid Blumenthal is the Human Equivalent of a Semen-Stained Dress\u201d). And while I find Grayson\u2019s economic positions generally idiotic, I actually share his views on many things, ranging from marriage equality to demilitarizing American police to curtailing the surveillance state to ending mindless overseas interventions. (I\u2019m not convinced, however, that the vile Dick Cheney has \u201cblood that drips from his teeth,\u201d as Grayson once testified on MSNBC.)\n\nIf he wasn\u2019t so consistently a jackass, who knows? He might actually be more effective at creating the country he wants to live in and building bridges across raging waters. But I guess jackasses have to jack, amirite?\n\nMembers of Congress should be held to higher standards than regular voters. They should be expected to live their lives more cleanly than the rest of us and they should talk to one another respectfully, especially on topics where the disagreements are the deepest. I\u2019m not talking about the patently phony decorum that gets trotted out every time a senator starts clearing his throat as he ascends the dais to lecture a nearly empty chamber about the excellence of his colleagues and the desperate need for a traffic light to be fixed in his hometown.\n\nNo, I\u2019m talking about the sort of truly honest and open political debate we desperately need in Washington. It\u2019s just not going to happen if our elected officials are steeped in the extremist \u201cwingnut rhetoric\u201d that is properly left to citizens, journalists, and the rest of us with an opinion and an Internet connection.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "nickgillespie"}, "keywords": "Alan Grayson, u.s. poli", "publicationDate": 201505220915, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "description": "Why we should all be ashamed of Alan Grayson, the Sunshine State\u2019s most loathsome congressman.", "pageNum": 1, "title": "Americas Most Awful Liberal Is a #FloridaMan: Alan Grayson", "tags": "entity:person/alan_grayson,topic:politics", "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"America\u2019s Most Awful Liberal Is a #FloridaMan: Alan Grayson\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/05/22/america-s-most-awful-liberal-is-a-floridaman-alan-grayson.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/05/22/america-s-most-awful-liberal-is-a-floridaman-alan-grayson/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/47742863.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/05/22/america-s-most-awful-liberal-is-a-floridaman-alan-grayson\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-05-22T09:15:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"Politics\",\"author\":\"Nick Gillespie\",\"tags\":[\"alan_grayson\",\"politics\"]}", "news_keywords": "Alan Grayson, US Politics", "sectionTaxanomies": "politics", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "Nick Gillespie", "article": {"section": "politics", "published_time": "2015-05-22T09:15:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/nick-gillespiehtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/05/22/america-s-most-awful-liberal-is-a-floridaman-alan-grayson", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "Why we should all be ashamed of Alan Grayson, the Sunshine State\u2019s most loathsome congressman.", "title": "America\u2019s Most Awful Liberal Is a #FloridaMan: Alan Grayson", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/05/22/america-s-most-awful-liberal-is-a-floridaman-alan-grayson.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/05/22/america-s-most-awful-liberal-is-a-floridaman-alan-grayson/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1432285909176.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "authorIds": "/etc/authors/n/nick-gillespie", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "article_summary": "No, I\u2019m talking about the sort of truly honest and open political debate we desperately need in Washington.\nGROSSWhy we should all be ashamed of Alan Grayson, the Sunshine State\u2019s most loathsome congressman.\nFlorida voters, accustomed as they are to reading about \u201cFlorida Man,\u201d don\u2019t always want his spiritual cousin representing them in Congress (Grayson would return to Washington in 2013, representing a newly redrawn 9th district).\nAs the self-styled \u201cCongressman With Guts,\u201d Grayson has yet to reach bottom when it comes to throwing low blows.\nWhich brings me to Alan Grayson, the congressman who is vying to become the political equivalent of @_FloridaMan, a never-ending series of cringe-inducing incidents, headlines, and actions that define\u2014and defame\u2014an entire state."}
