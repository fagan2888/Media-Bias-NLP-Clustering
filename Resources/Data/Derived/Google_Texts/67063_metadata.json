Gov. Nikki Haley caused a stir this morning when she posted on her social media accounts about getting locked out of the Governor\u2019s Mansion in downtown Columbia, S.C.\n\n\u201cWhat not to do,\u201d Haley wrote on her Facebook wall. \u201cGetting locked out of the Governor\u2019s mansion in your robe while sending the kids off to school. sigh.\u201d\n\nHaley\u2019s post immediately made the local news \u2013 and prompted Palmetto State Democrats to send out a press release questioning what Haley does (and doesn\u2019t) disclose to the public.\n\n\u201cIt certainly is telling about Nikki Haley\u2019s priorities when it comes to sharing information with the people of South Carolina,\u201d S.C. Democratic Party spokeswoman Kristin Sosanie said, referring to a number of scandals which Haley kept hidden from the public.\n\nReally? This is a \u201cthing?\u201d Haley flip flops on defunding Obamacare and nobody utters a peep \u2013 but she gets locked out of her house and it\u2019s statewide news?\n\nWTF, media?\n\nThe vast majority of Haley\u2019s Facebook followers wrote in support of the governor in the wake of her misadventure.\n\n\u201cJust shows how human you really are and that your (sic) do make mistakes like the rest of us!\u201d one wrote. \u201cThat\u2019s why this state loves you as Gov. your (sic) bringing in jobs and not afraid to admit when you make a mistake and defending our laws of moral sense!\u201d\n\nMoral sense?\n\nMmmm-kay.\n\nSeriously, though, if you\u2019ve never perused the comments left by Haley supporters on her Facebook wall it\u2019s always fun times.
