In some cases the payer has Medicaid or another type of coverage and doesn\u2019t owe the penalty at all.\n\nThe IRS said it received several reports of the scam and that it takes various forms.\n\nSome shady preparers instructed filers to pay the tax directly because of their immigration status, while others said a direct payment could reduce the amount of the tax.\n\nScammers tended to target Spanish speakers with limited proficiency in English.\n\nThe agency encouraged people to learn about exemptions from the tax and study its directory of credentialed tax preparers.\n\n\u201cThe vast majority of tax professionals provide honest, high-quality service,\u201d the IRS said. \u201cHowever, the IRS encourages taxpayers to avoid dishonest and unscrupulous preparers by choosing their preparer wisely.\u201d\n\nThis tax season marks the first time filers have to document their health care status on their returns.

This year, the penalty rises to $325 or 2 percent of income.\n\nThe administration and several states have offered a special enrollment period to people who owe the penalty for 2014 and missed the chance to get covered and avoid this year\u2019s heftier fine.\n\nCustomers in 37 states can select a health plan on the federal HealthCare.gov exchange between Sunday and April 30 if they meet three conditions \u2014 they\u2019re paying the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d tax for lacking insurance in 2014, learned about the penalty after Obamacare enrollment closed Feb. 15 and have not already enrolled in coverage for the 2015 plan year.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The IRS warned Americans taxpayers Friday of a scam that leverages Obamacare's penalty for lacking insurance in 2014.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The IRS warned Americans taxpayers Friday of a scam that leverages Obamacare\u2019s penalty for lacking insurance in 2014.", "title": "Tax preparers scamming filers for Obamacare \u2018individual mandate\u2019 tax: IRS", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/mar/13/tax-preparers-pulling-obamacare-scam-irs-says/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/03/13/Health_Overhaul_Tax_Scams.JPEG-0451c.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/03/13/Health_Overhaul_Tax_Scams.JPEG-0451c.jpg", "description": "The IRS warned Americans taxpayers Friday of a scam that leverages Obamacare's penalty for lacking insurance in 2014.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Tax preparers scamming filers for Obamacare \u2018individual mandate&"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Social Issues, Internal Revenue Service"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2525\"", "article_summary": "The agency encouraged people to learn about exemptions from the tax and study its directory of credentialed tax preparers.\nBut \u201cunscrupulous preparers\u201d or other scammers are telling filers to make the payment directly to them.\nSome shady preparers instructed filers to pay the tax directly because of their immigration status, while others said a direct payment could reduce the amount of the tax.\nThe IRS warned Americans taxpayers Friday of a scam that leverages Obamacare\u2019s penalty for lacking insurance in 2014.\n\u201cHowever, the IRS encourages taxpayers to avoid dishonest and unscrupulous preparers by choosing their preparer wisely.\u201dThis tax season marks the first time filers have to document their health care status on their returns."}
