Evidently President Obama “misspoke” again. A new report from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services estimates that 11 million small business employees will see their health insurance premiums increase.

Remember when the president and other Dems promised that Obamacare would cut family premiums by $2,500? Fox News anchor Martha MacCallum does.

Good morning! 11 million will pay higher rates for health insurance sz CMS. So wait, who saves $2500? — martha maccallum (@marthamaccallum) February 25, 2014

Who saves $2,500? Not the “typical family” insured under a small business plan. The promised savings are just another lie for the New York Times to declare an “incorrect promise.”

CMS claims 6 million small business workers will see lower premiums under Obamacare, but the report doesn’t estimate the amount of the decrease. Chances are, if you liked the idea of lower rates, you can keep dreaming of lower rates. Period.

@marthamaccallum next year we will pay twice in premiums with $12.7k deductibles. It's like 2nd mortgage . — Yulia Goldshteyn (@AY4WEB) February 25, 2014

@marthamaccallum @TIMT57 Only 11M. Obama will spin this as "11M men now covered 4 unwanted pregnancies!" — Kevin Jackson (@Theblacksphere) February 25, 2014

@marthamaccallum According to Sebelius, this is "patently false." So is the loss of jobs. My company incurring $54 million in new expenses. — Todd (@jcmthe4th) February 25, 2014

And about that “11 million” figure …

@marthamaccallum It took a couple of minutes to hit me, but if they say 11 million we KNOW the figure will be much higher. They'll [1/2] — Marc Hoover (@MarcHoover1) February 25, 2014

@marthamaccallum just "adjust" later, like previously projecting 7 million enrollees by 3/31 & now 5-6 million would be a "hell of a start". — Marc Hoover (@MarcHoover1) February 25, 2014
