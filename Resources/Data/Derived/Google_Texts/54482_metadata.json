When it comes to retirement security, would you be better off in: (a.) the U.S., (b.) Canada, (c.) South Korea or (d.) the Czech Republic?\n\nThe answer, according to Natixis Global Asset Management, a Paris- and Boston-based company with $894.3 billion under management, is Canada, followed by South Korea and the Czech Republic \u2014 with the U.S. bringing up the rear among that group.\n\nFor the third year in a row, the U.S. barely cracks the top 20 countries when it comes to retirement security, according to this year\u2019s annual ranking from Natixis. Among the other countries the U.S. trails: top-ranked Switzerland and second-ranked Norway, as well as Australia, New Zealand, Iceland and Luxembourg. The U.S. also trails Japan, which vaulted from 27th last year to 17th this year, thanks to its \u201cfiscal reforms and health-care improvements,\u201d the report says. And the U.S. barely edges out Slovenia \u2014 a country where GDP per capita is nearly half what it is in the states.\n\nNot surprisingly, Western European countries with big commitments to social-welfare programs dominate the top 20. While many of these countries have higher tax rates than the U.S. does, they also have better-funded national retirement programs. Top-ranked Switzerland has a mandatory pension system and a \u201cwell-funded universal health system,\u201d says Natixis. Norway came in second thanks to its income equality \u2014 a measure with a big impact on retirees, the report adds.\n\nThe Natixis Global Retirement Index ranks 150 countries on 20 measures of health, wealth, quality of life, and material well-being that affect retirement security. The measures include per capita income, health-care costs and longevity figures published by organizations including the World Bank, World Health Organization, the United Nations and Gallup, which polls citizens on happiness and satisfaction.\n\nWhile the U.S. is top-ranked on such key financial measures as low inflation and high GDP growth, it lags behind other nations when it comes to access to medical care and income equality.\n\nThis is the third year in which Natixis has conducted the survey \u2014 and the U.S. hasn\u2019t budged from its No. 19 ranking.\n\nRead: U.S. scores poorly in retirement rankings\n\nThe report takes the U.S. to task because it lacks a retirement savings program with universal access. Only about half of U.S. workers are currently covered by work-based retirement plans, including 401(k) plans.\n\nSee: The promising retirement plan that\u2019s stuck in Congress\n\nHere\u2019s how the U.S. ranked on health, wealth, quality-of-life, and material well-being subcomponents of its overall score:\n\nPublic finances: The U.S. ranked 14th in this category, getting its strongest grades for low interest rates and low inflation. But it was weighed down by its high government debt and its aging population, which are likely to strain Social Security and Medicare programs.\n\nHealth: On health, the U.S. ranked 19th, up from 21st a year ago, thanks to the expansion of health-care coverage under the Affordable Care Act. On the downside: The U.S. \u201cspends more per capita on medical care than any other nation,\u201d but that \u201chas not yet translated into improved life expectancy,\u201d the report notes.\n\nQuality of life: The U.S. ranked 25th, ranking relatively low in part due to its role as the main producer of carbon dioxide emissions.\n\nMaterial well-being: Here, the U.S. came in at No. 37. While we enjoy relatively high per capita income, our income inequality is greater than in most other countries.\n\nAside from Japan, countries that saw their rankings improve included Australia, Iceland, Canada and the Netherlands.\n\nAs was the case last year, several African nations brought up the rear. Togo finished last among the 150 countries, with the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Comoros and Lesotho also among the bottom 10. Natixis didn\u2019t comment on why these countries finished toward the bottom, but these nations generally have high poverty levels, very little health infrastructure and few or no established retirement-savings systems.\n\nHere are the top 20 (along with their 2014 rankings):\n\n1. Switzerland (1st)\n\n2. Norway (2nd)\n\n3. Australia (5th)\n\n4. Iceland (11th)\n\n5. Netherlands (13th)\n\n6. Sweden (4th)\n\n7. Denmark (6th)\n\n8. Austria (3rd)\n\n9. Germany (7th)\n\n10. New Zealand (9th)\n\n11. Luxembourg (10th)\n\n12. Canada (14th)\n\n13. Finland (8th)\n\n14. South Korea (17th)\n\n15. Czech Republic (16th)\n\n16. Belgium (12th)\n\n17. Japan (27th)\n\n18. France (15th)\n\n19. U.S. (19th)\n\n20. Slovenia (21st)", "article_metadata": {"lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "description": "Expensive health care and widespread income inequality make the U.S. an iffy place to retire, compared with much of Europe, Australia or Canada.", "creator": "@AnneTergesen", "image": {"width": 1320, "identifier": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DD480_switze_ZG_20150115065845.jpg", "height": 742}, "site": {"id": 624413}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "parsely-author": "Anne Tergesen", "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "article.section": "Retirement", "parsely-type": "post", "description": "Expensive health care and widespread income inequality make the U.S. an iffy place to retire, compared with much of Europe, Australia or Canada.", "parsely-link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/in-retirement-ranking-18-countries-beat-the-us-2015-02-10", "author": "Anne Tergesen", "parsely-title": "In retirement security, 18 countries outrank the U.S.", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=336693422", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-02-10T16:14:00-05:00", "page.site": "marketwatch", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 283204329838}, "parsely-section": "MW_Retirement", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "MarketWatch", "description": "Expensive health care and widespread income inequality make the U.S. an iffy place to retire, compared with much of Europe, Australia or Canada.", "title": "In retirement security, 18 countries outrank the U.S.", "url": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/in-retirement-ranking-18-countries-beat-the-us-2015-02-10", "image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DD480_switze_ZG_20150115065845.jpg", "type": "article"}, "ob": {"image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DD480_switze_ZG_20150115065845.jpg"}, "article.id": "60821572-B149-11E4-85C9-70697EF1BF20", "position": 1}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdc05\"", "article_summary": "The Natixis Global Retirement Index ranks 150 countries on 20 measures of health, wealth, quality of life, and material well-being that affect retirement security.\nWhen it comes to retirement security, would you be better off in: (a.)\nFor the third year in a row, the U.S. barely cracks the top 20 countries when it comes to retirement security, according to this year\u2019s annual ranking from Natixis.\nRead: U.S. scores poorly in retirement rankingsThe report takes the U.S. to task because it lacks a retirement savings program with universal access.\nWhile many of these countries have higher tax rates than the U.S. does, they also have better-funded national retirement programs."}
