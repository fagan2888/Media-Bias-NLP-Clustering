A year ago she was diagnosed with stage three breast cancer, and thanks to the ACA and the subsidies it provided, she was able to afford health insurance that covers a large part of her surgeries and treatment. An adverse ruling in King v Burwell could put an end to that.\n\nRelated: Supreme court hears challenge to Obama's health law: everything you need to know\n\nThe case before the supreme court argues that the ACA subsidies offered in 34 states \u2013 including Missouri, where Appelbaum lives \u2013 are illegal. The suit was brought by four residents of Virginia, a state that, like Missouri, uses the federally supported exchange rather than setting up one for itself. The plaintiffs say they were not supposed to qualify for premium tax credits, which according to the law were supposed to be available only on exchanges \u2018\u201cestablished by the states\u201d.\n\nWithout the subsidies, the plaintiffs argue, their health insurance would have been unaffordable and they would be exempt from having to purchase it to comply with the law. If the supreme court rules in their favor, some 8-9 million Americans could lose their subsidies, making their health coverage significantly more expensive and possibly unaffordable. Appelbaum is one of those Americans.\n\nThe 48-year-old didn\u2019t always go through life without health insurance. She had it for six years when in 2010, having just miscarried, Appelbaum found out that her and her husband\u2019s policy didn\u2019t cover pregnancies and miscarriages. According to an analysis by the National Women\u2019s Law Center, before the ACA went into effect only 12% of insurance plans offered in the individual market covered maternity services.\n\nI am more scared right now that the Republicans and the supreme court might kill me rather than my cancer' LaDonna Appelbaum\n\nHoping to have a baby, Appelbaum set out to find an insurance plan that would cover a future pregnancy \u2013 only to find out that such a plan would cost \u201csomewhere between $1,000-$1,600 more a month than I was currently paying\u201d.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t wrap my head around that. Being as aggravated and as mad as I was at the insurance company, I stopped paying for health insurance for Tom and I and we went without,\u201d she says.\n\nThat is, until February 2014, when they enrolled in health insurance through the federally supported marketplace on healthcare.gov. They found a reasonable plan provided by Anthem Blue Cross that cost them about $180 a month, with subsidies covering a little over $600. Last year, her husband was in a boating accident and injured a tendon in his hand. The surgery, cast and physical therapy would have cost them about $30,000 without coverage. And the costs would have kept on coming as, months later, Appelbaum was diagnosed with breast cancer.\n\n\u201cThat changed my life forever,\u201d she says. \u201cSince my diagnosis I had all kinds of pre-surgical testing, a double mastectomy, and I started chemo back in November and am still in the process of it.\u201d\n\nAfter the chemo treatment that she will receive while the supreme court hears oral arguments in King v Burwell, Appelbaum has four more treatments left. Then it\u2019s on to radiation. The only reason she can afford all of these treatments is the subsidies that have kept her health insurance costs low. If they go away, Appelbaum is afraid she won\u2019t be able to afford the necessary treatment.\n\nObamacare subsidy interactive Nadja Popovich for the Guardian\n\n\u201cI am petrified, to be quite honest, of what can happen. I am more scared right now that the Republicans and the supreme court might kill me rather than my cancer,\u201d she says, crying. \u201cI know that\u2019s horrible to say, but I feel like I am getting the treatment that I need. My doctors are wonderful. And then I get scared whenever I hear that they might take the subsidies away or they might repeal it. I honestly don\u2019t know how we would pay for this.\u201d\n\nAppelbaum, an office manager at her husband\u2019s law firm, says she isn\u2019t embarrassed to say she doesn\u2019t have money to pay for her insurance without the subsidies \u2013 especially because in 2010 a close friend died of breast cancer after losing her insurance post-diagnosis.\n\n\u201cWhenever I think about what I am going through, I have to think about [her] and what she went through because she didn\u2019t have the Affordable Care Act to help her like I have,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the reasons that I am so vocal about it.\u201d\n\nHer friend was a strong supporter of the ACA and of President Obama.

She has taken her concerns all the way to the steps of the US supreme court.\n\nWithin a week of buying her health insurance in January 2014, Burton saw a doctor to help get a handle on her diabetes. Prior to that, she had been uninsured for five years. Having graduated law school right after the recession, Burton says she was essentially forced into private practice. With her diabetes and narcolepsy \u2013 both of which are pre-existing conditions \u2013 she would have had to pay about $750 a month for health insurance. That\u2019s as much as she was paying for her mortgage.\n\nHer current Blue Cross Blue Shield plan, purchased through the federal marketplace, cost her $70.17 a month in 2014. This year the plan went up by $20, to $90.17. The subsidies cover about $298 a month, she says.\n\n\u201cBeing a mom and not having medical insurance for yourself is irresponsible, because you\u2019ve got to be able to take care of yourself and keep yourself in good health if you are going to take care of your family,\u201d says Burton, who is a single mother of four (her children qualify for state-provided health insurance). \u201c[Now] I got a great insurance and don\u2019t have that stress of wondering if something happens to me, what\u2019s going to happen to my children.\u201d\n\nIf the court rules against subsidies in King v Burwell, Burton says she won\u2019t be able to afford her plan any more.\n\n\u201cFor me to lose my subsidy, I would go back to not being covered again and have my diabetes go back to being out of control again,\u201d she says. \u201cI am hoping that the supreme court will rule in our favor and keep the subsidies in place. I don\u2019t think it should have to be a situation where you have to chose between good health and providing for your family.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#005689", "description": "If the court rules subsidies in states that use the federal healthcare exchange are illegal, some 8-9 million Americans may suddenly be unable to afford insurance.
