This week, presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump tried to mend fences with the Republican political establishment, but many remain skeptical.Will Trump change some of his more controversial and divisive positions, like building a wall on the Mexico border, or restricting Muslim immigration?And what about the uber conservatives who worry that Trump's values have more to do with the art of the deal rather than arch-conservatism?Joining us is Ed Cox, the head of the New York State Republican Party.There was a time - not long ago - when, if you had a pre-existing medical condition - a health insurance company could deny you coverage.No more.There was also a time that once your child turned 21 - or graduated college - they were on their own in terms of health insurance.No more.And more than 40 million Americans - not that long ago had no health insurance. If they got sick, most went to the emergency room.If those who say they want to repeal health care reform have their way - all that would return.So what's the real 4-1-1 on what's known as Obamacare?Joining us is Dr. Ken Davis, CEO of the Mount Sinai Health System.The next time someone tells you that young people these days are self-absorbed, smartphone addicted, and selfish, take a look at this interview.Victoria Pannell, a junior in high school in Manhattan, is absorbed in doing public service.She is the youngest member of her community board - just 16.
