See e.g. here, here, here and here.\n\nThat said, it turns out that conservatives mocking PajamaBoy do so not because he is an insufferable sissy, but because they are afraid of him. See this painfully good retort to conservative PajamaBoy jeers:\n\nConservatives are calling PajamaBoy a symbol of Obama supporters\u2019 un-American dependence on government, but at this point he\u2019s more of a vehicle for conservatives to express their anxiety about losing wars, political and cultural\u2026 The problem with mocking a president who wears mom jeans is you\u2019re still the folks who lost two elections to a guy who wears mom jeans\n\nThis leads us to a startling thought. Is it possible that PajamaBoy really is what young men (or at least a vast number of them) are like these days? Or, to be rather more subtle, is PajamaBoy with the subliminal message of state-sponsored comfort and \u2018safety\u2019 really now a dominant social norm?\n\nThe other day I led a training event at a smart institution in bourgeois England. The session had to begin with a Health and Safety announcement. It turns out that these are getting more and more elaborate. It\u2019s no longer enough to know where fire escapes are. People are now asked to move their bags under their chairs lest someone trip and fall.\n\nThey are urged to report sharp desk-edges. Umbrellas with a pointed end are catalogued as potentially lethal objects. Squidgy executive stress-balls have to be put to one side, as they \u2018might be thrown and injure someone\u2019. Oh, and be aware of the possibility that a light-bulb might explode and spray glass everywhere.\n\nWhen you politely ask whether all this is actually necessary, you\u2019re told that \u201cIt\u2019s the law\u201d.\n\nThis is simply not true. It\u2019s not the law. Rather the organisation concerned has out-sourced its sense of responsibility to the most fevered imagination of a querulous \u2018health and safety\u2019 operative who has decided to justify his/her job by drawing up pompous lists of any conceivable and inconceivable \u2018risk\u2019 so as to help fend off an eventual lawsuit for negligence should a freakish workplace accident happen.\n\nPeople are no longer responsible for their own fate. If they fail to keep their eyes open and duly hurt themselves, someone else is to blame. Find that someone, then sue.\n\nThe underlying ideology here is to create the idea of a completely \u2018safe\u2019 space in which no-one feels \u2018threatened\u2019 either by physical risks or by the words, deeds or attitudes of others.\n\nWoe betide any male speaker these days who is too forceful or challenging or throws in the odd rude word: that sort of thing is open to sly objection as inappropriate, if not bullying and in any case odiously patriarchal and heteronormative.\n\nWhere is all this heading? One answer is Gosport in southern England in 2011 where tragically Simon Burgess drowned in a shallow boating pool because the public officials who volunteered to rescue him were directly ordered not to do so as they had not had the right training.\n\nThis episode has two levels of horror. The fact that such an order could be given. And, much worse, the fact that the wretched officials actually obeyed it.\n\nThus the state-sponsored PajamaBoyisation of moral responsibility. The state demands money from you to pay for rescue services. You go to prison if you refuse to pay your taxes. But when you need rescuing you get help only if it\u2019s \u2018safe\u2019 to help you.\n\nSuch moral and philosophical dry rot seeps upwards. We now see Chief of the Defence Staff General Sir Nicholas Houghton warning about a \u2018creeping aversion to risk\u2019 affecting our foreign policy:\n\nWe must be careful as a society and as a professional military not to lose our courageous instinct since it is one of the things which keeps us in a class apart.\n\nAtlas Shrugs captures it all well, opening with Eddie Willers trying to work out why he had a \u2018sense of dread without reason\u2019:\n\nNo, he thought, not dread, there\u2019s nothing to fear: just an immense diffused apprehension, with no source or object\n\nAnd that\u2019s the truly creepy thing about all this modern \u2018safety\u2019 ideology and the accompanying imagery and language as represented by the absurd PajamaBoy. It is an intrinsically collectivist idea that purports to give you comfort and safety, but on condition you surrender courage and risk-taking as values-in-themselves and instead accept an accompanying sense of inherent, inexorable anxiety.\n\nCharles Crawford is a Contributing Editor to The Commentator.
