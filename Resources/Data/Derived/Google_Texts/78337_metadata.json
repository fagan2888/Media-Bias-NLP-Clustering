This post examines the how of ACA reporting. In particular, it provides a primer on the electronic filing system\u2014referred to as the Affordable Care Act Information Return System (AIR)\u2014that the Internal Revenue Service has developed and deployed to facilitate the submission of reporting data to the government.\n\nSome carriers are relying on outside vendors, while others are handling the submission process internally. Either way, carriers appear to be generally familiar with the AIR system, and those that we have encountered are well into the enrollment and testing process. Employers, in contrast, are not as far along the learning curve. As a result, the delay in the filing deadlines announced in the recent IRS Notice 2016-4 is most welcome. Most employers that we have encountered have chosen to rely on outside vendors. The result has put a strain on vendor capacity\u2014at the same time that vendors are still in beta testing mode. For example, the IRS launched a more demanding AATS testing environment in January 2016 and software developers who tested in 2015 continue to make changes to their systems to adapt to IRS changes. As a consequence, some employers are finding it difficult to engage vendors. And in the case of those that have, we have encountered software that falls short of full ACA reporting functionality. For example, we encountered an instance in which a vendor software program was unable to fill in Form 1095-C, Part II, Line 16. (The employer was put in a position of having to do this manually.)", "article_metadata": {"displaytag": "ACA reporting", "sailthru.author": "Alden J.
