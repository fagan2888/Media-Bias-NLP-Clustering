They instead chose property about a half-mile north, owned by developer Gary Sippel. That property had once been considered for a shopping mall.\n\nHenshaw said the 190,000-square-foot building would house offices for UPMC, offices for the Penguins and two ice rinks. It would be the first of a five-stage development of the property. UPMC would build the $70 million complex, and the Penguins would lease most of it.\n\nDevelopment plans show that other components, as introduced to the advisory commission last week, include six buildings with 875,000 square feet of office space; two buildings with 16,200 square feet of retail space; 30,000 square feet of restaurant space; and a 100-room hotel.\n\nThe project also features a roundabout, or traffic circle, and would connect with extensions of Mackenzie Way and Cranberry Springs Drive.\n\nIt also could feature a \u201cfly-under,\u201d or road under Route 228, that connects the Cranberry Woods office park to the Cranberry Springs project, which are on opposite sides of Route 228.\n\nHenshaw said that funding issues and timing of construction of the underpass would be worked out later, as developers are concentrating on the UPMC/Pens project first.\n\n\u201cIt's very important to the overall traffic patterns and traffic mitigation for the project,\u201d Henshaw said.\n\nUPMC and the Pens said earlier they hoped to have the facility open in 2015.\n\nDevelopers will have to gain approval from the Planning Advisory Commission and township supervisors before proceeding.\n\nThe advisory commission could vote as early as its Oct. 7 meeting.\n\nIf developers secure approval for the overall use of the land, they would have to return to both boards for approval of individual parts of the development, with the first being the UPMC/Pens project.\n\nBill Vidonic is a staff writer for Trib Total Media.
