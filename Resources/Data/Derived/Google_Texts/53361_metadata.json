Many eye ailments that can cause blindness have no symptoms in their earliest stages. To protect your vision now and into the future, it is important to get regular, comprehensive eye exams.\n\nMay is Healthy Vision Month \u2013 and the best way to commemorate the occasion is with a complete eye exam. Especially if you are one of the more than 23 million Americans age 18 and older who, according to a national survey conducted by the National Eye Institute (NEI), have never had their eyes examined.\n\nAccording to the NEI, the most common reason for not getting an exam is assuming that you don't have an eye problem.\n\n\"People tend to put off basic health care when budgets are tight. If you don't think you have an eye problem, it seems safe to delay getting your eyes checked. But that may result in missing the early signs of an eye disease that becomes harder to treat effectively over time,\" said Bill Chase, vice president of marketing for :DentalPlans.\"\n\n:DentalPlans offers affordable alternatives to traditional health insurance, including vision care savings plans. These plans enable members to save significantly on the cost of eye exams, glasses, contact lenses, even LASIK surgery at thousands of eye care facilities \u2013 both national chains and local providers \u2013 nationwide.\n\nA comprehensive eye exam, including dilation \u2013 a painless process which allows doctors a view inside of the eyes, is the best way to know if your eyes are healthy. A comprehensive eye exam also includes tests for glaucoma, a group of diseases that can damage the optic nerve; and tests to gauge how well you can see things at a distance and from the side.\n\n\n\nAccording to the NEI, those aged 60 and up should have a comprehensive exam annually, while younger people should have one at least once a decade, starting in their 20s. Your eye care provider may wish to see you more often, particularly if you have a health condition such as diabetes, so it's best to follow his or her advice in scheduling check-ups.\n\n\n\nWhatever you do, don't skip getting your exam. Glaucoma currently affects more than 3 million Americans, but only half are aware they have the disease, according to The Centers for Disease Control. The NEI predicts that by 2030, 4.2 million people will have glaucoma.\n\nBesides regular exams, other ways to protect your vision include maintaining a healthy lifestyle, knowing your family's history of eye disease (some conditions that can cause blindness are genetic), using the appropriate protective eyewear on the job or while playing sports, and wearing sunglasses that block out 99 to 100% of both UVA and UVB rays.\n\nMore than 11 million Americans currently have an uncorrected visual impairment that can impact their quality of life, according to the NEI.
