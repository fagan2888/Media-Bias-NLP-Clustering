Specifically he is closely examining the component of the law that requires people to either buy health insurance or pay a fine. Waller is comparing his own conclusions on the ethical implications of this mandate to his research on other people\u2019s reactions.\n\n\u201cLearning ethics has been some of the most difficult thinking I\u2019ve done, but it has been very rewarding as well,\u201d said Waller. \u201cNow I view situations more clearly and have discovered some of my own definitions of right and wrong.\n\n\u201cNot only does this research directly impact my understanding of how health systems work, I am learning how complex some of the issues facing Americans today really are while reducing my own ignorance to a sector that will always affect my life,\u201d he added.\n\nRegarding the URSF program, Waller said it allows him to further pursue his academic interests while not interfering with his athletic commitment.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m grateful that I\u2019ve gotten this summer fellowship because I\u2019m able to both do the research I enjoy and stay in Richmond to meet my football needs,\u201d Waller said.\n\nTo learn more about The Richmond Guarantee and other U.R. students benefitting from this program, visit www.richmond.edu/guarantee.\n\nRobert Morris University\n\nMOON TOWNSHIP >> Dana Davis of Garnet Valley and Jonnai Jones of Sharon Hill were named to the dean\u2019s list for the spring 2015 term at Robert Morris University.\n\nWheaton College\n\nWHEATON, Ill. >> Rachel Anstatt of Media and Sydney Gougeon of Glen Mills were named to the dean\u2019s list for the spring 2015 semester at Wheaton College.\n\nTo earn dean\u2019s list honors at Wheaton, an undergraduate student must carry 12 or more credit hours and achieve a 3.5 grade point average or higher on the 4.0 scale.\n\nStevenson University\n\nOWINGS MILLS, Md. >> Philip Iacona and Jacqueline Kelly, both of Aston, earned dean\u2019s list honors from Stevenson University.\n\nThe dean\u2019s list recognizes full-time undergraduate students whose academic achievement is outstanding in each semester.
