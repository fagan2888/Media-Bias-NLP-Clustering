Iowa City, IA

Authorities have canceled an Amber Alert after a hearing-impaired 9-year-old eastern Iowa girl was found.



Capt. Gary Kramer with the Johnson County Sheriff's Office said in a news release that Brianna Crane was found early Sunday and "appears to be in good health."



Authorities say someone dropped the girl off with law enforcement around 1:30 a.m. Sunday.



Then Davenport Police arrested the 48-year-old man suspected of taking the girl around 9:30 Sunday morning at a home in Davenport.



Kramer says authorities are investigating what happened.
