If thinking about Obamacare gives you headaches, be glad you’re not a member of a film crew in the Los Angeles area.

Imagine you’re a lighting technician who, in the space of a year, works on a Walt Disney Co. /quotes/zigman/245568/delayed /quotes/nls/dis DIS film for two months, then moves over to the NBC /quotes/zigman/89420/delayed /quotes/nls/cmcsk CMCSK lot nearby in Burbank, Calif. to do a short-lived sitcom for three months.

Then you’re off to Culver City over the Santa Monica Mountains to do another film for Sony Pictures /quotes/zigman/197524/delayed /quotes/nls/sne SNE for another two months, and then on to the Fox /quotes/zigman/18008451/delayed /quotes/nls/fox FOX lot in Century City for three months as a temporary fill-in on one of that network’s shows.

You’re considered full time in all those jobs, but who insures you? The truth is, none of those four companies are obligated because you didn’t stay longer than 90 days. That’s the trouble that some of the behind-the-scenes workers in Hollywood face as they try to navigate President Obama’s health-care overhaul, says Mark Goldstein, chief executive of Entertainment Partners.

The Burbank-based company contracts out to studios and film producers for payroll and production management services. But finding an answer to the Obamacare question isn’t an easy one. And employers aren’t off the hook. They still employ full-time staffs throughout the year; it’s just that it can be a constantly revolving crew.

“The industry has reached out to see if we could facilitate something,” Goldstein said. With up to 100,000 non-union workers spread out to do as many as 3,000 projects a year, it’s tough to find a cost-effective way to insure those workers.

In an effort to cut through the confusion, Entertainment Partners has set up its own private insurance exchange so that the risk could be spread throughout the entire industry. That way the makeup artist that drifts from job to job can be on equal footing with, say, a camera operator that has been working on “Jimmy Kimmel Live” in the heart of Hollywood for the last five years.

Trouble is, much of the rest of the film industry that doesn’t contract out with Entertainment Partners’ “EP Cares” program can’t participate in the exchange. Until then, however, others in the film industry and its workers may be scrambling to find insurance. Because of the uneven nature of entertainment work, large chunks of workers could be left to get coverage on their own.

“An entire full-time employee base could be subject to penalties,” he said.
