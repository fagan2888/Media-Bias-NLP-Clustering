An interim principal has been hired at Cheltenham Elementary after the principal’s resignation over accusations that she had Latino kids eat lunch on an office floor.

Denver Public Schools Superintendent Tom Boasberg hired C.J. Grace to begin working Monday, according to a news release.

“Grace is an experienced teacher, principal and principal trainer, focusing her entire career on the instruction and support of English language learners,” the news release says.

Grace serves as a director in DPS’s department of English language acquisition.

The principal who resigned, Kalpana Rao, was the focus of complaints from parents in the spring when they learned of the lunch incident, which some called humiliating.

Rao, who resigned Friday, had said the children were waiting to have behavioral issues addressed and there was a dearth of seats.

“(Rao) is a person of integrity who deeply cares about social justice and improving educational and life opportunities for our kids and families, especially those who most need those opportunities,” Boasberg said in a statement.

School starts Aug. 31.
