even as New Yorkers continued to face long waits to apply for the cards.\n\nThe website where residents can make an appointment to get an ID was back up and running Thursday after crashing on its first day in operation - but as of mid-afternoon, the earliest available appointment at the central Brooklyn Public Library was for March 4.\n\nMark-Viverito defended the program as she and five other Council members put in their paperwork at the library.\n\n\u201cThis is a good challenge to have, when you have such an overwhelming demand,\u201d she said, noting the inoperable website was quickly fixed. \u201cAs we go along, we learn the challenges, and we work along the way to resolve them.\u201d\n\nShe said the city might open more enrollment centers to cut down on wait time, and that the troubles with the rollout were nothing like the botched enrollment process for Obamacare.\n\n\u201c\u201cThat is really an unfair comparison,\u201d Mark-Viverito said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about a temporary hiccup in a rollout that has been extremely positive.\u201d\n\nThe cards, which any city resident can apply for, are intended to provide an official ID for undocumented immigrants, the homeless, transgender people, and other who struggle with government ID.\n\n\u201cFor many years I\u2019ve carried an ID that did not match my gender identity, and this impeded me from cashing checks, applying for different benefits, and going about my life,\u201d said Phoenix Natasha Russell, a transgender Brooklyn woman who applied for a card alongside the pols Thursday. \u201cThis municipal ID...validates me as a New Yorker.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2080195.1421361132!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/mmv-muni.jpg", "description": "Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito and the City Council\u2019s top municipal ID boosters applied for their IDs Thursday -
