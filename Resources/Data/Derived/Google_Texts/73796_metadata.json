John Bel Edwards (D) and Sen. David Vitter (R) has crossed into new territory about the kind of personal attacks candidates can launch against one another.\n\nIt started late last week when Edwards released a merciless ad charging that Vitter \u201canswered a prostitute\u2019s call minutes after he skipped a vote honoring 28 soldiers who gave their lives in defense of freedom.\u201d\n\n\u201cDavid Vitter chose prostitutes over patriots,\u201d the spot concludes, with an image of Vitter standing in front of the iconic white headstones at Arlington National Cemetery. \u201cNow the choice is yours.\u201d\n\nIn 2007, Vitter\u2019s phone number appeared in the phone records of the late Deborah Jeane Palfrey, known as the \u201cD.C. Madame,\u201d who ran a prostitution ring in the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nRelated: As Carson Stumbles, Trump Slowly Turns the Knife\n\nVitter apologized for a \u201cvery serious sin\u201d in the wake of that scandal, and one of his first ads in the current contest to replace presidential contender Bobby Jindal featured his wife, a clear attempt to put the indiscretion behind him.\n\nBut with less than two weeks left before Louisianans head to the polls, Vitter had no choice but to respond on Monday with an ad of his own to try to cauterize any damage inflicted by Edwards.\n\n\u201cFifteen years ago, I failed my family but found forgiveness and love. I learned that our falls aren\u2019t what define us, but rather how we get up, accept responsibility and earn redemption,\u201d Vitter says in the new spot.\n\n\u201cNow, Louisiana has fallen on hard times: a budget crisis, low wages, failing schools. You know me, I\u2019m a fighter. And as your governor, I\u2019ll get up every day to fight for you for a much better, stronger Louisiana,\u201d he says.\n\nRelated: Chris Christie Should Be Glad He Was Dropped to the Undercard Debate\n\nLouisiana has become a Republican state, but Jindal\u2019s unpopularity has made the race for Baton Rouge competitive.\n\nEdwards and Vitter were the top two finishers in Louisiana\u2019s \u201cjungle\u201d primary on October 24, meaning they got to move on to a run-off vote on November 21.\n\nRecent polls show Edwards with a large lead over Vitter, but the new, bare-knuckled commercial shows the he isn\u2019t taking anything for granted after last week when the Republican gubernatorial candidate in Kentucky proved all the pollsters wrong -- beating the Democrat and delivering the state house to the GOP for the first time in decades.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Louisiana\u2019s gubernatorial race between state Rep.
