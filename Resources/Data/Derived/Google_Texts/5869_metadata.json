He is Professor Emeritus of Pediatrics, Pathology, and Decision Science; and former Chief of Cardiology (Pediatric). Dr. Deane serves on the Board of Directors of the New Mexico Health Insurance Exchange (NMHIX). Opinions offered here are Dr. Deane's alone, and do not necessarily reflect those of the NMHIX Board.\n\nIt is increasingly clear that President Barack Obama\u2019s reform of American healthcare (sorry, even the president admitted he was reforming health insurance not care) is nothing less than the elimination of all private health insurance. At that point we will have de facto single payer healthcare: the American healthcare system under total control by Washington, D.C.\n\nWhile we know that Bernie Sanders would be cheering, the American people won\u2019t be happy at all, not with what we get (or don\u2019t get.)\n\nIn recent news, UnitedHealthCare Insurance, the largest insurer of Medicare enrollees, announced that the losses previously projected at $425 million for selling Obamacare insurance underestimated their true losses, which will exceed $500 million. Not even UnitedHealth can sustain such losses for very long.\n\nMeanwhile, Humana Inc. announced on January 8 that it would set aside a \u201cpremium deficiency reserve\u201d for its 2016 Obamacare business. This is insurance-speak for when expenses are greater than revenue. Just like UnitedHealth, Humana and others are losing money when selling Obamacare insurance.\n\nAetna and Anthem have already left the market and stopped selling Obamacare insurance.\n\nPrivate insurance companies are beginning to do what hospitals have been doing for years to stay in business: revenue shifting. They take money from profitable customers to cover losses mandated by the government. For insurance, that means charging higher and higher prices for private coverage.\n\nAs the premium prices go up, fewer and fewer people will buy private insurance, meaning less profit to cover required losses. This will force insurance to raise prices further. Eventually no one will buy private insurance because no can afford it. Voil\u00e0! Private insurance is being murdered (\u201celiminated\u201d) by government fiat.\n\nBy Obamacare law, upheld by the Supreme Court, citizens* are required to purchase health insurance. When private insurance leaves the market, the last man standing will be the government. Then the only option available to Americans will be the \u201cpublic\u201d one.\n\n(*Despite the draconian effects on the vast majority of individuals, nothing will change for the 12-15 million undocumented Americans. They will still be prohibited from government supported insurance yet still can get \u201cfree\u201d care through Emergency Rooms as required by the Emergency Medical Transport and Active Labor Act of 1986. How hospitals will cover these very large government mandated losses is unclear.)\n\nWhen government insurance is the only insurance available, the government will solely determine benefits. There will be no market competition. Government will also dictate what medical care you get and what care will be denied. Remember the Independent Payment Advisory Board? That is the federal agency that rations your medical care.\n\nLet\u2019s review the bidding, as they say in bridge. Washington will then control the entire market in healthcare, both supply and demand. Government decides your care; not you, not your doctor, not even your insurance company. Government determines how much you pay by dictating insurance prices and through a host of hidden taxes. Government takes money from providers to pay bureaucrats, so there will be no doctors.\n\nAnd we all will die while standing in line waiting for our government approved health care, just like our American veterans.\n\nUntil recently, the death of commercial insurance was merely a prediction by vigorous opponents of the president\u2019s reform law. Now, the evidence is starting to confirm this unfortunate reality.\n\nDr. Deane Waldman MD MBA is author of just released \u201cThe Cancer in the American Healthcare System;\u201d Host of www.wecanfixhealthcare.info; Professor Emeritus of Pediatrics, Pathology and Decision Science; and Adjunct Scholar (Healthcare) for the Rio Grande Foundation, a public policy think tank.
