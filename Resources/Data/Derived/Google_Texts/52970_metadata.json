In an interview after news of the country\u2019s first Ebola case broke, Richardson said the federal government must totally seal the American border \u2014 including air and land travel.\n\n\u201cThe number one duty of the president is the security and health and welfare of the nation and we need to shut this border like a steel trap,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, he is playing a role in the campaign perhaps larger than other longshot candidates of Maine\u2019s past. His impact \u201ccould really matter\u201d by taking votes away from Poliquin, said James Melcher, a political science professor at the University of Maine at Farmington.\n\nThe candidates seem to be responding in kind.\n\nPoliquin called Richardson in late August to implore him to drop out. Richardson held a joint press conference with Cain after Poliquin\u2019s campaign attempted to negotiate conditions with the Maine Public Broadcasting Network that would have barred Richardson from participating.\n\nRepublicans have dismissed Richardson. Maine Republican Party spokesman David Sorensen called him \u201ca gadfly candidate with some very bizarre views\u201d and said voters will coalesce behind Poliquin\u2019s \u201cmainstream, more realistic views about reforming Washington, D.C.\u201d\n\nCain, however, has said she\u2019ll refuse to debate if Richardson isn\u2019t included, saying that would be \u201cjust unfair.\u201d As she lunched at a table with business leaders at an event in Bangor last month, she said they should also invite Richardson to speak to them, since he has \u201ca major role\u201d in the race.\n\nRichardson scoffed at the notion that he could be an election spoiler, saying Republicans are the only ones who think that. Others, he said, are grateful to have another choice.\n\nAfter studying biology at the College of Charleston in South Carolina, he went into the Navy, serving from the Vietnam War through the Iraq war before his retirement in 2004. For the last 14 years, he has lived in Belfast, where he owns a construction company that builds coastal homes.\n\nHe made himself known in politics in 2012 after he entered the 2nd District race, saying he was inspired to enter politics by examples of government overreach by the Obama administration.\n\nThat year, behind backing from the tea party movement, he won more than a third of votes in the Republican primary for the seat as an underfunded newcomer compared to his opponent, former Maine Senate President Kevin Raye of Perry, who Poliquin beat for the Republican nomination to the seat in June.\n\nIn January, Richardson announced he had left the Republican Party to run as an independent for the district seat. He\u2019s said that \u201cboth parties are in bed together,\u201d and that his \u201cvalue system doesn\u2019t allow me to hang with people who don\u2019t have any conviction.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s a hard-line conservative who bills himself as a strict follower of the Constitution, opposing gun control, surveillance programs, the Affordable Care Act, many food regulations, free trade agreements and says all immigration must be halted to tamp down unemployment.\n\nHe said voters will get behind his message of limited government if he shares the stage with the favored candidates in the race\u2019s homestretch because they can identify with him. He says he can win.\n\n\u201cYou will not hear a canned stump speech from Blaine Richardson,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reason I\u2019m running is because you could rip my heart out, take an average person in the 2nd District\u2019s out, put mine in, and they\u2019d be the same person.\u201d\n\nMichael Shepherd \u2014 370-7652\n\n[email protected]\n\nTwitter: @mikeshepherdme", "article_metadata": {"description": "With little money, independent conservative Blaine Richardson is playing an outsized part in the race, with Republicans minimizing him and Democrats propping him up.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Central Maine", "description": "With little money, independent conservative Blaine Richardson is playing an outsized part in the race, with Republicans minimizing him and Democrats propping him up.", "title": "Navy captain touts resume in Maine's 2nd District, but voters aren't biting - Central Maine", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1000, "identifier": "http://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/331707_599651_20140731_poliquindeb.jpg", "height": 937}, "updated_time": "2014-10-07T10:49:37-04:00", "url": "http://www.centralmaine.com/2014/10/06/navy-captain-touts-resume-in-maines-2nd-district-but-voters-arent-biting/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/331707_599651_20140731_poliquindeb.jpg", "description": "With little money, independent conservative Blaine Richardson is playing an outsized part in the race, with Republicans minimizing him and Democrats propping him up.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Navy captain touts resume in Maine's 2nd District, but voters aren't biting - Central Maine"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=966680591", "fb": {"app_id": 754222714628811}, "article": {"section": "Congressional District 2 race", "published_time": "2014-10-06T16:43:08-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-07T10:49:37-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "DT-FwcrUrXtAltcTNXUsA7tR4Ha0CLErawYbGlkpg94", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd9ef\"", "article_summary": "As a retired Navy captain, Blaine Richardson served in conflicts and briefed high-ranking Washington officials on matters of war.\nToday: Independent Blaine Richardson of Belfast says his military experience makes him the best choice.\nStaff file photo by Joe Phelan Blaine Richardson of Belfast says his military experience makes him the best choice for the 2nd Congressional District.\nContributed photo Independent candidate Blaine Richardson appears at a joint appearance with Democratic candidate Emily Cain on July 31 outside the State House in Augusta.\n\u201cYou will not hear a canned stump speech from Blaine Richardson,\u201d he said."}
