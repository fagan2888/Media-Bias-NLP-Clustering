The study was split 45 percent and 55 percent between men and women, respectively.\n\nThe results revealed that the reasons for not getting a colonoscopy are varied, and no single reason dominates. But most participants cited one or two main reasons:\n\n28 percent do not feel it is necessary\n\n20.1 percent say it\u2019s too expensive\n\n20.1 percent dislike the procedure itself\n\n15.8 percent rely on other methods to avoid colon cancer\n\n6.5 percent do not know they are supposed to get one\n\n6.5 percent are too busy with other priorities\n\nAccording to the research, 16 percent (15.7) of all 50-65 year olds are not likely to ever get a colonoscopy. That leaves a lot of at-risk men and women open to the idea who perhaps just need better information to take action.\n\nTo dispel the myth that colonoscopies are unaffordable, StopColonCancerNow.com has created a digital quiz for consumers to understand their potential eligibility for a free or low cost screening colonoscopy under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nPhysicians agree colonoscopy is a vital screening tool. During a colonoscopy, precancerous polyps can be detected and removed before they develop into cancer; it is the only colon cancer screening test that does this. Despite this evidence, 18.5 percent of respondents say that a significant reason they haven\u2019t had a colonoscopy is that their doctor has never discussed the need for it with them.\n\nThe survey, conducted by research firm Mizzouri, also revealed that better prep methods could persuade 32.3 percent of people to schedule the procedure. And, contrary to popular belief, women are more reticent than men about having a colonoscopy.\n\nStopColonCancerNow.com makes it easy to schedule a screening and is the ultimate resource for approachable information about colon cancer screenings and costs.\n\nAbout StopColonCancerNow.com\n\nStopColonCancerNow.com is a community of more than 1,000 physicians who have joined forces to promote education and awareness about colon cancer screening and prevention. AMSURG, provider of approximately one in every 10 colonoscopies in the United States, launched the campaign in 2009 as part of its commitment to provide the highest level of care and information to people at risk for colon cancer.
