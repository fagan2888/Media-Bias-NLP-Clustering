The OHI team will also provide education and information about OHI’s medical services for insured, uninsured and underinsured people of Ocean County, and veterans can get information about OHI’s participation in the Veterans Choice Program. At OHI’s tent, the public can get free blood pressure and glucose screenings.

New Egypt Day is a traditional street fair that includes food, music, vendors and lots of fun for kids, including inflatables, face painting, pony rides, and a petting zoo.
