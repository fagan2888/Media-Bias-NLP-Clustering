By Patrick deHahn / Oct 5, 2015 (Steve Hamblin/Fuse) (Steve Hamblin/Fuse)\n\nNew requirements established by the Affordable Care Act are causing confusion among unprepared nonprofits.\n\nThe 2015 Nonprofit Employee Benefits Survey, recently released by benefits management and research firm PPI Benefit Solutions, has found that very few nonprofits understand the new demands the Affordable Care Act (ACA) has put upon employers. These results come at a critical time for employers, since on January 1, 2015, all businesses with at least 100 full-time equivalent employees were required to start providing health coverage. (There are also requirements for organizations with fewer than 100 employees.)\n\n\u201cSurvey results indicate that in 2015, fewer nonprofits understand Affordable Care Act (ACA) requirements, and nearly half consider ACA compliance to be \u2018very challenging,\u2019\u201d PPI said in a news release. \u201cFurthermore, a majority of surveyed nonprofits have not calculated the cost of compliance.\u201d\n\nThat cost, should nonprofits not get up to speed, could translate into significant penalties when new regulations kick in.\n\nConfidence Crisis\n\nMany nonprofits were confident in their understanding of ACA compliance in 2014, but this year that number has fallen significantly.\n\nNinety-two percent of those surveyed in 2014 claimed they had \u201ca moderate understanding\u201d of the ACA, according to PPI. Out of that majority, 18 percent said they were \u201cextremely knowledgeable.\u201d\n\nBut this year just 47 percent say they have a \u201cmoderate understanding\u201d of compliance rules, and only 5 percent consider themselves \u201cextremely knowledgeable.\u201d\n\nA Path Forward\n\nBecause many nonprofits consider complying with the ACA to be \u201cvery challenging,\u201d they are increasingly seeking individual expertise or help from outside of their organization.\n\n\u201cSmaller, mid-sized employers are relying heavily on their brokers and administrators to bring clarity around certain aspects of the law, what does or does not apply, and what tools are available to help them meet their requirements,\u201d Karen Greco, director of marketing at PPI, said in the news release.\n\nAnother change resulting from the legislation\u2019s implementation: More nonprofits are shifting costs to employees. This is happening via health savings accounts (HSAs), which feature lower premiums but high deductibles. The number of surveyed organizations offering HSAs increased to 56 percent in 2015 (compared with just 12 percent last year).\n\nAnd though nonprofits may be unprepared or confused about complicated new requirements, close to 100 percent of those surveyed will still commit to providing healthcare for employees.\n\nAnd for those committed organizations, PPI has some advice in its report:\n\n\u201cGain a better understanding of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and develop a plan to comply with 2015/2016 requirements. Look to your benefits administrator or broker for ACA information and service solutions. Leverage data collection and reporting from Benefits, Payroll, and HRIS systems.\u201d\n\nShare this article", "article_metadata": {"description": "New requirements established by the Affordable Care Act (ACA) are causing confusion among unprepared nonprofits.", "pocket-site-verification": "f7059b70f081a1e1ced322fc1d9787", "og": {"site_name": "Associations Now", "description": "New requirements established by the Affordable Care Act (ACA) are causing confusion among unprepared nonprofits.", "title": "Nonprofits Largely Unready for New Healthcare Requirements", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://associationsnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Affordable-Care-Act.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-10-06T18:37:08+00:00", "url": "http://associationsnow.com/2015/10/survey-nonprofits-affordable-care-act/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Associations Now", "description": "New requirements established by the Affordable Care Act (ACA) are causing confusion among unprepared nonprofits.", "title": "Nonprofits Largely Unready for New Healthcare Requirements", "image": "http://associationsnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Affordable-Care-Act.jpg", "creator": "@mlittlesf", "site": "@associationsnow", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"admins": 502961619}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/AssociationsNow", "section": "Uncategorized", "published_time": "2015-10-05T15:54:34+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-06T18:37:08+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Money & Business, Affordable Care Act"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf690\"", "article_summary": "Survey: Nonprofits Largely Unready for New Healthcare Requirements AND What's this?\nBy Patrick deHahn / Oct 5, 2015 (Steve Hamblin/Fuse) (Steve Hamblin/Fuse)New requirements established by the Affordable Care Act are causing confusion among unprepared nonprofits.\n\u201cFurthermore, a majority of surveyed nonprofits have not calculated the cost of compliance.\u201dThat cost, should nonprofits not get up to speed, could translate into significant penalties when new regulations kick in.\n\u201cSurvey results indicate that in 2015, fewer nonprofits understand Affordable Care Act (ACA) requirements, and nearly half consider ACA compliance to be \u2018very challenging,\u2019\u201d PPI said in a news release.\nAnd though nonprofits may be unprepared or confused about complicated new requirements, close to 100 percent of those surveyed will still commit to providing healthcare for employees."}
