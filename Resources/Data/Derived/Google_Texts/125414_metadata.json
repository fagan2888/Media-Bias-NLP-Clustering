His Wyman's of Maine has invested more money north of the border, which has far lower business costs that the U.S. would do well to emulate. THE NORTHERN EDGE Wyman\u2019s of Maine has operations in Canada and Maine. Here\u2019s a look at the income tax differences: In Maine 39.5% Federal tax 7.9% State tax 3.8% Medicare tax 0.9% Affordable Care Act tax in Canada 15% National tax 16% Provincial tax Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store \u2192\n\nWyman\u2019s President and CEO Ed Flanagan told a group of U.S. and Canadian trade officials Thursday that Canada has several advantages over Maine: drastically lower taxes, free employee health care, desirable land, better access to a seasonal workforce, and more reasonable food regulations.\n\n\u201cCanada really has pulled way ahead of Maine in terms of a place to source your berries,\u201d he said while speaking at a trade symposium at the University of Southern Maine campus in Portland that was designed to promote trade between Maine and Canada.\n\nFlanagan said he occasionally encounters an angry customer who is upset about the fact that Wyman\u2019s, which has a strong reputation as a good corporate citizen, has been expanding its operations north of the border. He noted, however, that an even greater number have expressed unhappiness that Wyman\u2019s sells frozen raspberries grown in Chile.\n\n\u201cNo, our mangoes don\u2019t come from Maine, either,\u201d Flanagan said with a smile.\n\nThe bottom line, he said, is that expanding into Canada was a smart business decision for the family-owned company.\n\nMaine frequently appears on lists of the worst states in which to do business because of its aging population and stagnant population growth, along with high taxes and heavy regulation. It appeared at No. 48 on the Forbes annual list of best states for business in 2015 and at No. 45 in a similar analysis by CNBC last year.\n\nBut Flanagan said he isn\u2019t going around telling business groups about the company\u2019s Canadian strategy because he is \u201cmad\u201d at Maine or the United States. His hope is that explaining the hurdles that Wyman\u2019s faces in Maine, and the benefits it enjoys in Canada, will spur positive change.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about urging the United States to do better,\u201d he said.\n\nTake, for example, the difference between corporate tax rates in the U.S. and Canada.\n\nFlanagan said that in Maine, the family members who own the company pay a 39.5 percent federal tax on net income, in addition to a 7.9 percent state tax, 0.9 percent Affordable Care Act tax and 3.8 percent Medicare tax. That\u2019s 52.1 percent of all profits paid out in taxes, he said. Wyman\u2019s is an S corporation, which means all business profits \u201cpass through\u201d to the owners, who report them as income on their personal tax returns.\n\nFlanagan said Wyman\u2019s Canadian subsidiary only has to pay a 15 percent national tax and a 16 percent provincial tax, or roughly 21 percentage points less than in the U.S.\n\n\u201cEvery $1 million of profit shifted to Canada saves us $210,000,\u201d he said.\n\nINCENTIVES TO GROWTH IN CANADA\n\nUnlike some large corporations that move money offshore specifically to avoid paying taxes, Wyman\u2019s has a strong justification for its Canadian operations, Flanagan said. Wyman\u2019s Canada owns thousands of acres in New Brunswick and on Prince Edward Island \u2013 prime locations for wild blueberries. In 2004, it acquired about 50 acres on Prince Edward Island, followed by another 3,700 acres there and 8,200 acres in New Brunswick.\n\nIn 2014, the company opened a new blueberry processing and cold storage facility on Prince Edward Island.\n\nFlanagan called the New Brunswick acreage \u201cthe finest piece of land that this blueberry man, at least, will ever find.\u201d\n\nAnother advantage to Canada is that the blueberry industry there is growing, he said, thanks to government incentives that have attracted young people to the business. Those incentives don\u2019t exist in Maine.\n\nStill another benefit is seasonal labor, Flanagan said. The harvest season for Wyman\u2019s blueberries only lasts 30 days, in late summer and early fall. Finding skilled pickers willing to travel to northern Maine for one month of work each year is difficult, and he said the inability of federal lawmakers to hash out a stable, long-term policy on migrant labor hasn\u2019t helped. Skilled labor is more readily available in Canada, Flanagan said.\n\nWyman\u2019s, which was founded in 1874, employed 165 full-time workers year-round in Maine in 2014 and added more than 300 seasonal workers during the harvest, according to its website. It employed about 65 people in Canada that year. Flanagan told the trade group that the company now has 254 employees in Maine and 72 in Canada.\n\nDoing business in both Maine and its largest trade partner also serves as a hedge against shifts in the exchange rate for Canadian and U.S. dollars, he said. Blueberries are a commodity, and changes in the relative value of a country\u2019s currency can dramatically affect their price.\n\n\u201cBeing on both sides of the border in a commodity business like ours is a hedge strategy,\u201d Flanagan said.\n\nNO HEALTH INSURANCE BURDEN\n\nOne of the greatest cost savings for a company in Canada is that it doesn\u2019t have to subsidize its employees\u2019 health insurance premiums, Flanagan said. In some areas of rural Maine, where health insurance is more expensive, the cost of paying for employee benefits can exceed the cost of paying their wages, he said. But in Canada, there is no need for health insurance, because medical care is free.\n\nAnother factor that may surprise some Americans is that Canada\u2019s food regulations are less onerous and more reasonable, Flanagan said, adding that Canadians also are not as litigious as U.S. citizens.\n\n\u201cGovernment regulations in the U.S. are becoming a lot more illogical and punishing,\u201d he said. \u201cCanada is regulated, but with more common sense.\u201d\n\nThursday\u2019s business symposium was the first such forum hosted by the University of Maine System\u2019s new Maine Center for Graduate Professional Studies. The center\u2019s CEO, former Maine gubernatorial candidate Eliot Cutler, was the keynote speaker.\n\nJ.
