Her decision set off a predictable rage by politicians across the state, but like so many environmental battles, the arguments from both sides may be more exaggeration than substance.\n\nKing Cove officials claim that the proposed single lane road is necessary because inclement weather frequently makes their airport unsafe for landings, even in an emergency. It\u2019s not uncommon for the airport to be closed for days. So rather than waiting for the weather to improve, residents would have the option of driving 30 miles to Cold Bay\u2019s more reliable airport. From there they could be flown to a hospital in Anchorage.\n\nNow let\u2019s look at Gov. Sean Parnell\u2019s official reaction. He calls the project a \u201cmatter of life or death for Alaskans\u201d and accuses the federal government of denying King Cove residents access to emergency medical treatment. This is the same governor who refused to accept Medicaid expansion provisions of the Affordable Care Act so that more than 40,000 low-income residents across the state could afford health care.\n\nBut dismissing Parnell\u2019s rant as partisan hypocrisy doesn\u2019t mean that the emergency medical situations in King Cove aren\u2019t real. The main point is that it\u2019s an in-kind response to the trademark hyperbole long practiced by environmentalists.\n\nFirst though, let\u2019s consider some of the facts they\u2019ve raised. For instance, award-winning writer and conservationist Kim Heacox claims the main reason King Cove wants to build the road is that it would be more economical to transport fish from the Peter Pan Seafood processing plant to the market via the Cold Bay airport. That\u2019s well documented in a National Wildlife Refuge Association (NWRA) white paper titled \u201cAlaska\u2019s Red Herring Highway.\u201d However, even if that was the original objective for the road, it\u2019s not now. By law it would be closed to commercial use. But the NWRA, along with 10 other environmental groups, still filed objections, citing how the Dalton Highway evolved from a limited-access haul road to having its use unrestricted.\n\nIn an Empire My Turn published Oct. 4, 2013, Heacox rhetorically asks: \u201cWhen does a refuge stop being a refuge?\u201d Has he ever been to the Sacramento National Wildlife Refuge Complex? Like many refuges down south, it\u2019s got plenty of roads traversing the nearby private property, which carves it into more than a dozen relatively small plots of land, all within easy driving distance of a few million people.\n\nSo how would a narrow, single lane road on the sparsely populated tail of the Alaska Peninsula cause \u201cirreparable damage to important fish, wildlife, habitat and wilderness values of the refuge\u201d? That\u2019s the conclusion of environmental groups and the basis for Secretary Jewell\u2019s decision. But doesn\u2019t that seem to be an overly dire forecast for the impacts of a 40-foot-wide road corridor across a strip of land that\u2019s three miles wide? Changes will occur, but development of this magnitude won\u2019t destroy the value of the refuge. Its creatures and plants won\u2019t be pushed toward extinction.\n\nThe real heart of the environmentalists\u2019 argument is similar to the one that\u2019s been at play in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. They fear that allowing any development at all would set a disturbing precedent for the entire National Wildlife Refuge system. It\u2019s the same \u201cthe sky will fall\u201d scenario as the National Rifle Association\u2019s warning to Americans that the passage of even one small gun control law is the doorway to abolishing the Second Amendment forever.\n\nThe scale of road construction and commercial development that\u2019s trampled the world elsewhere isn\u2019t about to happen here because of one access road in a remote wilderness. But by applying the same desperate argument whenever development is proposed on public lands, environmental organizations undermine the public\u2019s trust they need to deal with the serious problems facing the rest of our world. And more important to the real people of King Cove, this debate should be focused entirely on the nature of medical hardships they\u2019ve experienced.\n\n\u2022 Moniak is a Juneau resident.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Alaska, Juneau, newspaper, news, legislature, capital, Mendenhall, Douglas, southeast, Douglas Island, Gastineau Channel, Mendenhall Glacier, Auke Bay, Salmon Creek, Lemon Creek, Switzer Creek, Mendenhall Valley, Fritz Cove, Lynn Canal, Tee Harbor, Opinion, Rich Moniak, Cove, Kim Heacox, Sally Jewell, Sean Parnell, Kake, Empire, juneauempire, juneauempire.com, Local, Outdoors, Weather, All access, e-edition, iPad, Sports, Real Estate, Jobs, Cars, Homes, Art, Arts & Culture, Neighbors", "og": {"site_name": "Juneau Empire - Alaska's Capital City Online Newspaper", "description": "Just before Christmas, Interior Secretary Sally Jewell rejected a land exchange that would have permitted construction of a road between the remote communities of King Cove and Cold Bay.", "title": "Hyperbole and hypocrisy of the King Cove road dispute", "url": "http://juneauempire.com/opinion/2014-01-09/hyperbole-and-hypocrisy-king-cove-road-dispute", "image": "http://juneauempire.com/sites/default/files/images/sms-default-facebook-share.png", "type": "article"}, "description": "Find the latest news, crime, weather, business and community information from juneauempire.com and the Juneau Empire."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9e19\"", "article_summary": "They fear that allowing any development at all would set a disturbing precedent for the entire National Wildlife Refuge system.\nBut dismissing Parnell\u2019s rant as partisan hypocrisy doesn\u2019t mean that the emergency medical situations in King Cove aren\u2019t real.\nIn an Empire My Turn published Oct. 4, 2013, Heacox rhetorically asks: \u201cWhen does a refuge stop being a refuge?\u201d Has he ever been to the Sacramento National Wildlife Refuge Complex?\nAnd more important to the real people of King Cove, this debate should be focused entirely on the nature of medical hardships they\u2019ve experienced.\nHe calls the project a \u201cmatter of life or death for Alaskans\u201d and accuses the federal government of denying King Cove residents access to emergency medical treatment."}
