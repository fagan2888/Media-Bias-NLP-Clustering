Robert Bentley officially formed a task force today that will address how to bring more accessible and affordable health care to residents in the state of Alabama.\n\nThe 38-member Alabama Health Care Improvement Task Force created by executive order will look at how to increase access to health care in rural Alabama where there is a \"serious shortage\" of primary care physicians and dentists, the governor said.\n\nSome areas of focus may be telemedicine, medical resources in rural areas and scope-of-practice laws for nurse practitioners and other professionals.\n\nBentley said the task force's work will be long-term, but they are expected to bring the governor some initial recommendations before the 2016 legislative session in case legislation needs to be drafted.\n\nThe governor said Alabama won't expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, but he confirmed he has spoken with Sylvia Burwell, secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, about creating an Alabama health care plan, that would utilize private insurance.\n\nTo receive this coverage, able-bodied people must be employed or be in a workforce training program.\n\n\"I think that is only fair because we are trying to help them better themselves,\" Bentley said.\n\nThe governor said he wanted to create this task force in his first term, but he wanted to wait to see what happened with the Affordable Care Act. Now, he says it's still unknown what's going to happen with the federal program.\n\n\"We can't wait for the federal government to try to help our people in this state get health care and so we are going to proceed ... \" Bentley said. \"Alabama faces some really serious chronic problems - chronic conditions in this state. Many of our health care issues are related to lifestyle choices, related to poverty and related to access to quality healthcare.\"\n\nHe said the state must take steps to \"reverse the troubling health trends in our state.\"\n\nBecause Alabama is rural, the state needs to take a different approach including using telemedicine so physicians from Birmingham or Huntsville can treat a patient from the Black Belt area, Bentley said.\n\n\"Distance does not have to be an obstacle to health care,\" he said.\n\nState Health Officer Don Williamson said 65 percent of the state's rural hospitals are losing money.\n\nHe said the task force may look at changing the infrastructure of those hospitals into urgent care or emergency room units with fewer beds.\n\nThe 38-member task force includes doctors, medical school leaders, hospital administrators, insurance executives, nurses, state agency leaders, legislators and other professionals in mental health, dietetics, dentistry, public health, pharmacy, wellness and other specialties.\n\nHere is a list of the members:\n\n1.
