Belle Fourche, SD

Runnings is buying Motive Parts and Supply Inc. stores in Belle Fourche and Rapid City but the retail chain will close the Rapid City location.

Runnings director of marketing and advertising Dennis Jensen says that the company already operates a large retail store in Rapid City and doesn't need a second location. Jensen says all Motive Parts employees in the Belle Fourche location will be retained.



Mac and Steve Coldwell own the Belle Fourche store, which has been in operation since 1956. They say they'll continue to serve customers under the Runnings name.



Runnings employs more than 1,200 people at 31 stores in North Dakota, Minnesota, Montana and South Dakota. The chain sells sporting goods, clothing, footwear, farm, housewares, toys, pet supplies and tools.
