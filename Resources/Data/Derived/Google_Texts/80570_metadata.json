He worries that insurers will see Gilead\u2019s price and force patients to try a less effective, older and cheaper therapy first, he said.\n\nChavez has good reason to worry.\n\nPayers face billions of dollars in new drug costs as pharmaceutical companies develop increasingly complex products in the years ahead. Express Scripts Holding Co., Catamaran Corp., Aetna Inc. and CVS Caremark Corp. among others are already pushing back against the high cost of Gilead\u2019s drug. They\u2019re discussing how to pit similar drugs against each other, refusing coverage for some, or subjecting treatments to more review by outside experts and refusing to pay a premium based on one drug being more convenient to take than another.\n\nGilead\u2019s new drug, Sovaldi, costs $84,000 for a 12-week treatment. Such breakthrough treatments and their stratospheric price tags have \u201cabsolutely\u201d caused insurers to reconsider covering high-priced hepatitis, diabetes and other treatments, said Sumit Dutta, chief medical officer of Catamaran, the fourth-biggest U.S. pharmacy benefit manager, or PBM.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t manage exclusively by the techniques PBMs have used in the past,\u201d Dutta said by telephone. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing the shift, where payers are finally going to say, \u2019It\u2019s $84,000, and the other therapy is $50,000 -- what am I getting?\u2019\u201d\n\nStock Valuation\n\nFor drugmakers and biotechnology companies that have zeroed in on high-priced treatments to replace blockbusters such as Lipitor, the Pfizer Inc. cholesterol drug that once drew more than $12 billion a year before losing ground to generics, the change may affect how shareholders value their stocks, according to Les Funtleyder, a health industry expert and author of the book \u201cHealth-Care Investing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a feeling among investors that biotech drugs are immune from price competition,\u201d Funtleyder said in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019re getting to where we may have may reached a pain point.\u201d\n\nIncreasing Costs\n\nPrescription drugs make up an increasing share of U.S. health care spending. Spending on hepatitis C drugs alone is projected to rise seven-fold from $3 billion a year in 2011 to $21 billion in 2018, according to market research firm Decision Resources Group LLC. U.S. drug spending will grow 6.5 percent a year from 2015 to 2022, faster than overall health costs, according to the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. That\u2019s mostly driven by rising prices and a leveling off of generic drug use, according to the U.S. report.\n\nGilead shares fell 2.2 percent to $78.86 at 4 p.m. New York time. AbbVie Inc., which is also developing a treatment, declined 2 percent to $46.83.\n\nIt will take Gilead three to six months since it was approved Dec. 6 to formalize coverage with payers and PBMs, said Chief Operating Officer John Milligan in an e-mail. In the meantime, most plans are covering it, he said.\n\nWhen eventually combined with a second drug Gilead is studying, the regimen\u2019s price could rise to $100,000 or more per year, compared to what Catamaran says is about $66,000 for the current standard of care.\n\nThat\u2019s still cheaper than treating complications of hepatitis C, which can lead to liver damage or failure and the eventual need for transplant, said Gilead\u2019s Milligan.\n\n\u201cIn our conversations with payers, pricing is a consideration, but efficacy, safety and treatment guidelines are equally important,\u201d Milligan said.\n\nTools Available\n\nBesides payers already have plenty of tools to push back on costs and force patients to try cheaper medicines first, and they use them, said the drug industry\u2019s Washington trade group, Pharmaceutical Researchers and Manufacturers of America. \u201cTypically by the time the patients get through the various steps they need to get to the product, they really do need it,\u201d said Lori Reilly, PhRMA\u2019s head of policy.\n\nEven so, payers are thinking twice before opening their wallets. Jeff Park, Catamaran\u2019s chief financial officer, said some prescription plans managed by his company are already pushing patients to try older therapies first, moving to the more expensive ones only and only if they fail.\n\n\u201cYou can get to these more expensive treatments,\u201d Park said in an interview in San Francisco during the JPMorgan Chase & Co. health-care conference. But to do so, \u201cyou have to outweigh the costs of the first, more cost-effective treatment.\u201d\n\nSide Effects\n\nThat\u2019s a big concern for patients and advocates such as Chavez who say that strategy will force them to stick with side-effect-heavy older hepatitis C treatments that rely on difficult weekly injections, making a patient feel as if they have the flu over and over again.\n\nChavez contracted hepatitis C before the latest treatments were available. Now recovered, he helps others get hepatitis C as well as HIV treatment in the San Francisco Bay area. He took injections of interferon, an older drug, for almost a year to rid his body of the virus. It was a brutal regimen, he said, though it worked.\n\n\u201cIt was terrible,\u201d Chavez said. \u201cI was up against it, so I had to do it, But if I had the choice today I wouldn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nHe and others may not have that choice.\n\nSwitch Coverage\n\nLast year, Express Scripts stopped covering insulins and a diabetes injection made by Novo Nordisk A/S in favor of products from Eli Lilly & Co., AstraZeneca Plc and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. In the last four weeks, prescriptions of Lilly\u2019s insulin Humalog are up 15 percent compared with the four weeks before Express Scripts\u2019 change, while prescriptions of Novo\u2019s Novolog are flat.\n\nThe same sort of competition will happen with hepatitis C, said Charles Bancroft, the chief financial officer for Bristol-Myers. The New York-based company is developing its own regimen of hepatitis C drugs that will reach the market soon after Gilead\u2019s first-to-market treatment, and soon after AbbVie\u2019s second-to-market multi-drug treatment.\n\n\u201cThe Gilead product, the efficacy is at the highest level,\u201d Bancroft said in an interview at the JPMorgan conference. \u201cAll of them are good enough, though. What will eventually happen is that pricing will become more acute. What you\u2019ve seen in diabetes may happen more rapidly.\u201d\n\nBlocking Coverage\n\nExpress Scripts and other pharmacy managers have said that they\u2019re ready to block other drugs from coverage.\n\n\u201cWe will identify which drugs can be pitted against each other and make some really tough formulary decisions,\u201d the company\u2019s Chief Medical Officer Steven Miller said in a December interview.\n\nIn the U.K. and Europe, health regulators regularly weigh the benefit of drugs against their cost when deciding what the countries\u2019 national health systems will pay for. Bristol-Myers stopped selling a diabetes drug in Germany last month after the government refused to meet its price, for example.\n\nObamacare could have a similar effect as individuals begin to weigh the cost of insurance products, said Jami Rubin, an analyst with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. With the Affordable Care Act\u2019s insurance expansion, millions of new customers in the law\u2019s health care marketplaces will be picking and choosing among drug plans based on cost and coverage, instead of having their company pick a plan for them.\n\n\u201cWhat will society pay for a cure?,\u201d said Rubin. \u201cIs a cure worth $1,000 a day?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Drew Armstrong", "twitter": {"description": "As Gilead Sciences Inc. touted its $1,000-a-pill hepatitis C cure to investors in a hotel ballroom in San Francisco, a group of about 20 protesters milled outside. \u201cGilead=Greed,\u201d one sign read.", "title": "At $84,000 Gilead Hepatitis C Drug Sets Off Payer Revolt", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-01-27/at-84-000-gilead-hepatitis-c-drug-sets-off-payer-revolt", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iE88VtV1wjlk/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "site": "@business", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-author": "Drew Armstrong", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "Catamaran Corp,Health,Drugs,Gilead Sciences Inc", "news_keywords": "Catamaran Corp,Health,Drugs,Gilead Sciences Inc", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-01-27/at-84-000-gilead-hepatitis-c-drug-sets-off-payer-revolt", "parsely-title": "At $84,000 Gilead Hepatitis C Drug Sets Off Payer Revolt", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-01-27T21:09:36.761Z", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "As Gilead Sciences Inc. touted its $1,000-a-pill hepatitis C cure to investors in a hotel ballroom in San Francisco, a group of about 20 protesters milled outside. \u201cGilead=Greed,\u201d one sign read.", "parsely-tags": "Catamaran Corp,Health,Drugs,Gilead Sciences Inc,Region: Global,Page: article", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.bwbx.io/business/public/images/favicons/mstile-144x144-bbd2101292.png", "date": "2014-01-27T21:09:36.761Z", "parsely-section": "science-energy", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "og": {"site_name": "Bloomberg.com", "description": "As Gilead Sciences Inc. touted its $1,000-a-pill hepatitis C cure to investors in a hotel ballroom in San Francisco, a group of about 20 protesters milled outside. \u201cGilead=Greed,\u201d one sign read.", "title": "At $84,000 Gilead Hepatitis C Drug Sets Off Payer Revolt", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-01-27/at-84-000-gilead-hepatitis-c-drug-sets-off-payer-revolt", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iE88VtV1wjlk/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "type": "website"}, "fb": {"status": "As Gilead Sciences Inc. touted its $1,000-a-pill hepatitis C cure to investors in a hotel ballroom in San Francisco, a group of about 20 protesters milled outside. \u201cGilead=Greed,\u201d one sign read."}, "parsely-post-id": "MZGXOA6VDKHZ01", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "parsely-image-url": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iE88VtV1wjlk/v1/-1x-1.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde63c\"", "article_summary": "The same sort of competition will happen with hepatitis C, said Charles Bancroft, the chief financial officer for Bristol-Myers.\nAs Gilead Sciences Inc. touted its $1,000-a-pill hepatitis C cure to investors in a hotel ballroom in San Francisco, a group of about 20 protesters milled outside.\nNow recovered, he helps others get hepatitis C as well as HIV treatment in the San Francisco Bay area.\nThat\u2019s still cheaper than treating complications of hepatitis C, which can lead to liver damage or failure and the eventual need for transplant, said Gilead\u2019s Milligan.\nSpending on hepatitis C drugs alone is projected to rise seven-fold from $3 billion a year in 2011 to $21 billion in 2018, according to market research firm Decision Resources Group LLC."}
