Their return brought us a new set of parenting concerns. When kids go off to college, they suddenly consider themselves adults. They feel the old kids\u2019 rules from their high school years no longer apply.\n\nSo it can be stressful to know how to parent your almost-adult child now that they\u2019ve concluded they no longer need to listen to a word you say.\n\nThat\u2019s why, in the most loving way possible, you should periodically remind them \u2013 roughly every two hours \u2013 about who is paying for their college and how you\u2019d be delighted to spend that money on a Mediterranean cruise for yourself if they don\u2019t clean up their act during their brief time home.\n\nI would like to share my best parenting advice for how to get your kids to cooperate when they come home from college.\n\nI really would. But I can no more decipher the code for how to parent college-age kids than I can explain why some people pay $200 more for a cell phone custom-colorized to match their purse. But I will try to impart some wisdom just the same.\n\nChallenge #1: The pit stop. Many parents experience the short-lived joy of welcoming their kids home for winter break only to become annoyed as their child vanishes seconds after their arrival, shouting, \u201cHi, Dad. Gotta go. Meeting Bridget to go shopping.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s easy to feel like your kids are only using your house as a place to crash at night, but that\u2019s not true. They are also using your house for the free food, free laundry service, and free use of your Lexus. Oh, and just in case you were wondering whether your child might be heading off to shop for a Christmas present for you \u2013 they\u2019re not. They\u2019re going shopping to swap out the color pattern on their swaggy new cell phone so that it can perfectly match their \u2013 well, you get the picture.\n\nThe key is to be patient. Your child is growing up, by which I mean they are turning into a narcissistic young wise ass who thinks the world owes them a college education, and they can come and go as they please with no responsibilities. So you just gave them $100 spending money, along with the keys to your Lexus simply because they begged you \u201cpretty please, Daddy\u201d \u2013 you\u2019re still not getting a present. Let it go.\n\nChallenge #2: The messy bedroom. Another frustration many parents share (and by \u201cmany parents\u201d I mean this writer) is how when their kids come home from college, they have somehow forgotten all the rules about keeping their room clean. Within 24 hours of arriving home, their room suddenly looks like a crime scene in which every square inch has been ransacked in a desperate search to locate the missing Hope Diamond.\n\nYou ask them to clean up and they say something like, \u201cI know. Chillax, dude. I\u2019ll do it when I get back from Trevor\u2019s party\u201d which, when translated using the Google Teenager-to-Parent language translator, means \u201cover my dead body.\u201d Once again, be patient. Your son is still figuring out this thing called adulthood. And no, I have no idea how he sneaked that beer keg into his bedroom closet. But I\u2019m confident he\u2019ll dispose of it just as soon as he and his five buddies \u2013 who somehow ended up crashing on your living room floor last night \u2013 have consumed the rest of the beer \u2013 which should be shortly before noon.\n\nChallenge #3: The boyfriend/girlfriend. Now that your precious little angel has morphed into a self-righteous college student who is way smarter than their parents, it\u2019s understandable that they might think they have achieved the status of adulthood and all the privileges that come with it, including having their boyfriend/girlfriend sleep in their bedroom under your roof.\n\nThis confusion is understandable because despite the 27 times you\u2019ve said \u201cunder no circumstances is a boy EVER allowed to sleep in your room unless that boy is your husband and the year is 2025\u201d, she never quite understood that this provision was meant to remain in effect beyond age 18. And she\u2019s now 18 and four months \u2013 and legally allowed to vote. So she votes that Blake can stay overnight in her room upstairs. See? It\u2019s just a simple misunderstanding \u2013 one that can quickly be ironed out by means of a long, heated shouting match involving cogent debate points about how you\u2019re the worst parent in the world and a murderer of love. Good luck getting that Christmas gift now, dad.\n\nChallenge #4: The chores negotiation. When they were younger, you told your kids you needed them to help with the chores, and they dutifully complied. Remember? Okay, perhaps I\u2019m confusing your family with an episode of the 1950\u2019s sitcom Father Knows Best. Now that your child is back home for Christmas break, don\u2019t count on them to help with the vacuuming\u2026 or making dinners\u2026 or spending one second with the family on Christmas day past the clock strike of noon (after they have slept until 11:30am).\n\nNow that they\u2019re in college and can legally drink hard alcohol (if they moved to Lithuania), they consider themselves fully emancipated. And every request turns into a negotiation \u2013 including your request that they try to act nicely to their younger sibling, for which they will most likely demand an exorbitant fee.\n\nIt\u2019s normal that they will push back when you ask for their help doing the dishes or, say, feigning consideration for anybody else\u2019s needs while they are visiting.\n\nThat\u2019s because, let\u2019s face it, there\u2019s just not enough time for them to see all their friends, crash four rave parties, watch every episode of Game of Thrones, and still find time to help out around the house. Something\u2019s got to give \u2013 like helping anyone related to them.\n\nBut you are still the parent. There are times when you simply need to lay down the law and remind your child that there is no such thing as a free lunch \u2013 ignoring the irony that during their entire visit, every lunch has in fact been free. Let them know gently but firmly that they will need to help out around the house if they expect you to keep paying for college. If you\u2019re firm, they\u2019ll respect you. No, just kidding. They won\u2019t. But you just might get them to take out the trash once before they head back to college. Personally, I\u2019d settle for them remembering to get rid of the beer keg in their bedroom closet. It\u2019s starting to smell gross.", "article_metadata": {"google-site-verification": "BJRhhAX0-HMwLuYcMtPOB6NAdO7bUX3D7seeI_tQT-Q", "generator": "Woo Framework Version 1.0.8"}, "article_summary": "I would like to share my best parenting advice for how to get your kids to cooperate when they come home from college.\nAnother frustration many parents share (and by \u201cmany parents\u201d I mean this writer) is how when their kids come home from college, they have somehow forgotten all the rules about keeping their room clean.\nThey are also using your house for the free food, free laundry service, and free use of your Lexus.\nWhen they were younger, you told your kids you needed them to help with the chores, and they dutifully complied.\nWhen kids go off to college, they suddenly consider themselves adults."}
