Without a Chase driver in Victory Lane, no driver clinched an automatic berth in the championship finale at Homestead.\n\nChase driver Ryan Newman was third, and Tony Stewart finished fourth. Chase drivers Joey Logano and Matt Kenseth were fifth and sixth.\n\nStewart gambled and stayed on the track after the race was red-flagged with 10 laps left. Earnhardt and Gordon pitted, and that one final stop was just enough for the milestone finish. Earnhardt got his fourth win of the season.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Dale Earnhardt Jr. wins at Martinsville Speedway", "title": "Dale Earnhardt Jr. wins at Martinsville Speedway", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/10/26/dale-earnhardt-jr-wins-at-martinsville-speedway/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141026__457903984p1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141026__457903984p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-26T16:28:04+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T15:44:17+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda224\"", "article_summary": "MARTINSVILLE, Va. \u2014 Dale Earnhardt Jr. won at Martinsville Speedway on Sunday a week after he was eliminated from the Chase for the Sprint Cup championship.\nWithout a Chase driver in Victory Lane, no driver clinched an automatic berth in the championship finale at Homestead.\nEarnhardt got his fourth win of the season.\nGordon was the highest finishing Chase driver.\nChase driver Ryan Newman was third, and Tony Stewart finished fourth."}
