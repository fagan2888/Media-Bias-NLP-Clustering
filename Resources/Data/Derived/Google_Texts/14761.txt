GOP presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) told CNN that he doesn’t have a Canadian passport on Wednesday while campaigning in Iowa.

Cruz was responding to GOP frontrunner Donald Trump’s statement that Cruz, being born in Canada, could be a big issue if he were the Republican nominee.

Trump said the Washington Post asked the question, raising the issue of Cruz’s birthplace.

“This was not my suggestion. I didn’t bring this up. A reporter asked me this question,” Trump stated.

“[Trump] also repeated his assertion that Cruz has a Canadian passport, which Cruz denied during a separate interview Wednesday with CNN’s Dana Bash,” reports CNN.

“Of course not,” Cruz said to Bash, about whether or not his being born in Canada is a problem. “Yes, I’m sure,” he added about not having a Canadian passport. “The media, with all due respect, love to engage in silly sideshows. We need to focus on what matters.”

Cruz said, “The legal issue is straightforward,” adding that it’s a “non-issue.” “Listen, the Constitution and the laws of the United States are straightforward. The very first Congress defined the child of a U.S. citizen born abroad as a natural-born citizen.”

Cruz was born in Canada, but his mother was a U.S. citizen.
