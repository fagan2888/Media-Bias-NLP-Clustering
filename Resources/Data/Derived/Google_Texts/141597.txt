NEW YORK — American Pharoah took a final gallop around Belmont Park on Friday before he attempts to win the Belmont Stakes and become the first Triple Crown winner in 37 years.

The Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner looked fresh and ready for his morning run but was held to an easy lap around the 1 1/2-mile oval by exercise rider Jorge Alvarez. Trainer Bob Baffert watched from well past the finish line.

“When he went by us after going around there he looked like he was just still floating over the race track like he normally does,” he said.

Since arriving Tuesday, the 3-year-colt has had a jog and two gallops. American Pharoah faces seven rivals Saturday in his bid to become the 12th Triple Crown winner and first since Affirmed in 1978.

“We’re all excited,” Baffert said. “The anxiety is starting to build up. The next time he’s on that track, it’ll be in front of 90,000 — wait, there’s still 8,200 tickets left. But I recommend you might want to scoop those tickets up. Everything looks good. I think he’s going to run his race.”
