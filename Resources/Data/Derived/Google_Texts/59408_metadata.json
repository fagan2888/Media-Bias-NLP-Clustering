Smith over a comment he made regarding the situation with Ray Rice\u2019s suspension.\n\nIn a related report by The Inquisitr, Michelle Beadle, CM Punk, and AJ Lee apparently used to be friends, but Beadle says that all ended when she gave her version of a friendly hello by calling Philip Brooks a \u201cf**k face\u201d while greeting him.\n\nThe Ravens had Ray Rice suspended for only two games after he assaulted his wife while on an elevator and was arrested for domestic abuse. This seemingly small punishment for violating the NFL personal conduct policy had Keith Olbermann spitting some angry words at the NFL since even a Dallas Cowboys player was banned for five days for stomping another player during a game.\n\nWhen Stephen A Smith spoke on First Take, he condemned the actions of Ray Rice, saying that men have no business raising their fists to women. But then his opinion suddenly became controversial:\n\n\u201cBut what I\u2019ve tried to employ the female members of my family, some of who you all met and talked to and what have you, is that again, and this what, I\u2019ve done this all my life, let\u2019s make sure we don\u2019t do anything to provoke wrong actions, because if I come, or somebody else come, whether it\u2019s law enforcement officials, your brother or the fellas that you know, if we come after somebody has put their hands on you, it doesn\u2019t negate the fact that they already put their hands on you. So let\u2019s try to make sure that we can do our part in making sure that that doesn\u2019t happen. \u201c\n\nThis particular section caused an angry Michelle Beadle to go to Twitter to discuss what she thought about that idea:\n\n\u201cSo I was just forced to watch this morning\u2019s First Take. A) I\u2019ll never feel clean again B) I\u2019m now aware that I can provoke my own beating\u2026. I\u2019m thinking about wearing a miniskirt this weekend\u2026I\u2019d hate to think what I\u2019d be asking for by doing so\u2026. I was in an abusive relationship once. I\u2019m aware that men & women can both be the abuser. To spread a message that we not \u2018provoke\u2019 is wrong\u2026. Violence isn\u2019t the victim\u2019s issue. It\u2019s the abuser\u2019s. To insinuate otherwise is irresponsible and disgusting. Walk. Away.\u201d\n\nSmtih responded to Beadle on Twitter, as well:\n\n\u201cThis will be a long tweeted message, folks. So please stay with me and let me finish my complete thought before responding\u2026b/c i\u2019m ANNOYED. In discussing the Ray Rice ruling earlier today on @ESPN_FirstTake, me and@RealSkipBayless ventured into discussing domestic violence. Upon hearing what I had to say, although admitting I could\u2019ve been more articulate on the matter, let me be clear: I don\u2019t understand how on earth someone could interpret that I somehow was saying women are to blame for domestic violence. And when I saw @MichelleDBeadle \u2014 a colleague I have profound respect for \u2014 tweet what she tweeted, enough is enough. Something needs to be said right now. REPEATEDLY i said: There is absolutely no excuse to put your hands on a women. REPEATEDLY, I said dudes who do that need to be dealt with. REPEATEDLY, I echoed when confronted by it in the past \u2014 when someone was stupid enough to touch a loved one of this man, raised by 4 older sisters, a mom and numerous female relatives and loved ones, that man was dealt with. From that point, I simply asked: now what about the other side. If a man is pathetic and stupid enough to put his hands on a woman \u2014 which I have NEVER DONE, btw \u2014 of course he needs to pay the price. Who on earth is denying that? But what about addressing women on how they can help prevent the obvious wrong being done upon them? In no way was I accusing a women of being wrong. I was simply saying what that preventive measures always need to be addressed because there\u2019s only but so much that can be done after the fact\u2026.once the damage is already done. Nothing more. My apologies to @MichelleDBeadle And any woman out there who misconstrued what I said. I have always \u2014 and will always \u2014 find violence against a women every bit as horrific as women, themselves, find it. Always have. Always will, which my personal behavior exemplifies. I\u2019ll strive to be more articulate in the future. But be clear, I wasn\u2019t BLAMING women for anything. I was simply saying to take all things into consideration for preventative purposes. Period.\u201d\n\nThis explanation did not impress Michelle Beadle since she simply responded, \u201cI stand by my word.\u201d What do you think about Stephen A.
