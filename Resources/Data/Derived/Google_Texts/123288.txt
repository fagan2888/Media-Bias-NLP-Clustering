Key sections of the Patriot Act expired Monday, temporarily freezing the collection of metadeta and prompting Jon Stewart to mock the Senate for its frenzied response — as well as call up his friend John Oliver to yell “penis.”

Politicians have known about the looming expiration date for some time now but have been slow-moving to correct it, Stewart noted on Monday’s “Daily Show.”

“Like a dog wearing a cone, looking at you like, ‘Can you believe they’re making me wear this cone?’ ” Stewart said. “And you’re thinking, ‘You’re the one chewing your own dick.’ ”

Stewart took the opportunity to examine the Act as a whole, and its role post-9/11, finding that terrorist attacks have occurred even while the government has monitored metadata. (Think: Fort Hood, the Boston Marathon, and the Garland, Texas fatal “Draw the Prophet” debacle.)
