The tasks we used to do can now be done more cheaply by lower-paid workers abroad or by computer-driven machines.\n\nMy solution\u2014and I\u2019m hardly alone in suggesting this\u2014has been an activist government that raises taxes on the wealthy, invests the proceeds in excellent schools and other means people need to become more productive, and redistributes to the needy. These recommendations have been vigorously opposed by those who believe the economy will function better for everyone if government is smaller and if taxes and redistributions are curtailed.\n\nWhile the explanation I offered a quarter-century ago for what has happened is still relevant\u2014indeed, it has become the standard, widely accepted explanation\u2014I\u2019ve come to believe it overlooks a critically important phenomenon: the increasing concentration of political power in a corporate and financial elite that has been able to influence the rules by which the economy runs. And the governmental solutions I have propounded, while I believe them still useful, are in some ways beside the point because they take insufficient account of the government\u2019s more basic role in setting the rules of the economic game.\n\nWorse yet, the ensuing debate over the merits of the \u201cfree market\u201d versus an activist government has diverted attention from how the market has come to be organized differently from the way it was a half-century ago, why its current organization is failing to deliver the widely shared prosperity it delivered then, and what the basic rules of the market should be. It has allowed America to cling to the meritocratic tautology that individuals are paid what they\u2019re \u201cworth\u201d in the market, without examining the legal and political institutions that define the market. The tautology is easily confused for a moral claim that people deserve what they are paid. Yet this claim has meaning only if the legal and political institutions defining the market are morally justifiable.\n\nII\n\nMost fundamentally, the standard explanation for what has happened ignores power. As such, it lures the unsuspecting into thinking nothing can or should be done to alter what people are paid because the market has decreed it.\n\nThe standard explanation has allowed some to argue, for example, that the median wage of the bottom 90 percent\u2014which for the first 30 years after World War II rose in tandem with productivity\u2014has stagnated for the last 30 years, even as productivity has continued to rise, because middle-income workers are worth less than they were before new software technologies and globalization made many of their old jobs redundant. They therefore have to settle for lower wages and less security. If they want better jobs, they need more education and better skills. So hath the market decreed.\n\nYet this market view cannot be the whole story because it fails to account for much of what we have experienced. For one thing, it doesn\u2019t clarify why the transformation occurred so suddenly. The divergence between productivity gains and the median wage began in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and then took off. Yet globalization and technological change did not suddenly arrive at America\u2019s doorstep in those years. What else began happening then?\n\nNor can the standard explanation account for why other advanced economies facing similar forces of globalization and technological change did not succumb to them as readily as the United States. By 2011, the median income in Germany, for example, was rising faster than it was in the United States, and Germany\u2019s richest 1 percent took home about 11 percent of total income, before taxes, while America\u2019s richest 1 percent took home more than 17 percent. Why have globalization and technological change widened inequality in the United States to a much greater degree?\n\nNor can the standard explanation account for why the compensation packages of the top executives of big companies soared from an average of 20 times that of the typical worker 40 years ago to almost 300 times. Or why the denizens of Wall Street, who in the 1950s and 1960s earned comparatively modest sums, are now paid tens or hundreds of millions annually. Are they really \u201cworth\u201d that much more now than they were worth then?\n\nFinally and perhaps most significantly, the market explanation cannot account for the decline in wages of recent college graduates. If the market explanation were accurate, college graduates would command higher wages in line with their greater productivity. After all, a college education was supposed to boost personal incomes and maintain American prosperity.\n\nTo be sure, young people with college degrees have continued to do better than people without them. In 2013, Americans with four-year college degrees earned 98 percent more per hour on average than people without a college degree. That was a bigger advantage than the 89 percent premium that college graduates earned relative to non-graduates five years before, and the 64 percent advantage they held in the early 1980s.\n\nBut since 2000, the real average hourly wages of young college graduates have dropped. The entry-level wages of female college graduates have dropped by more than 8 percent, and male graduates by more than 6.5 percent. To state it another way, while a college education has become a prerequisite for joining the middle class, it is no longer a sure means for gaining ground once admitted to it. That\u2019s largely because the middle class\u2019s share of the total economic pie continues to shrink, while the share going to the top continues to grow.\n\nIII\n\nA deeper understanding of what has happened to American incomes over the last 25 years requires an examination of changes in the organization of the market. These changes stem from a dramatic increase in the political power of large corporations and Wall Street to change the rules of the market in ways that have enhanced their profitability, while reducing the share of economic gains going to the majority of Americans.\n\nThis transformation has amounted to a redistribution upward, but not as \u201credistribution\u201d is normally defined. The government did not tax the middle class and poor and transfer a portion of their incomes to the rich. The government undertook the upward redistribution by altering the rules of the game.\n\nIntellectual property rights\u2014patents, trademarks, and copyrights\u2014have been enlarged and extended, for example. This has created windfalls for pharmaceuticals, high tech, biotechnology, and many entertainment companies, which now preserve their monopolies longer than ever. It has also meant high prices for average consumers, including the highest pharmaceutical costs of any advanced nation.\n\nAt the same time, antitrust laws have been relaxed for corporations with significant market power. This has meant large profits for Monsanto, which sets the prices for most of the nation\u2019s seed corn; for a handful of companies with significant market power over network portals and platforms (Amazon, Facebook, and Google); for cable companies facing little or no broadband competition (Comcast, Time Warner, AT&T, Verizon); and for the largest Wall Street banks, among others. And as with intellectual property rights, this market power has simultaneously raised prices and reduced services available to average Americans. (Americans have the most expensive and slowest broadband of any industrialized nation, for example.)\n\nFinancial laws and regulations instituted in the wake of the Great Crash of 1929 and the consequential Great Depression have been abandoned\u2014restrictions on interstate banking, on the intermingling of investment and commercial banking, and on banks becoming publicly held corporations, for example\u2014thereby allowing the largest Wall Street banks to acquire unprecedented influence over the economy. The growth of the financial sector, in turn, spawned junk-bond financing, unfriendly takeovers, private equity and \u201cactivist\u201d investing, and the notion that corporations exist solely to maximize shareholder value.\n\nBankruptcy laws have been loosened for large corporations\u2014notably airlines and automobile manufacturers\u2014allowing them to abrogate labor contracts, threaten closures unless they receive wage concessions, and leave workers and communities stranded. Notably, bankruptcy has not been extended to homeowners who are burdened by mortgage debt and owe more on their homes than the homes are worth, or to graduates laden with student debt. Meanwhile, the largest banks and auto manufacturers were bailed out in the downturn of 2008\u20132009. The result has been to shift the risks of economic failure onto the backs of average working people and taxpayers.\n\nContract laws have been altered to require mandatory arbitration before private judges selected by big corporations. Securities laws have been relaxed to allow insider trading of confidential information. CEOs have used stock buybacks to boost share prices when they cash in their own stock options. Tax laws have created loopholes for the partners of hedge funds and private-equity funds, special favors for the oil and gas industry, lower marginal income-tax rates on the highest incomes, and reduced estate taxes on great wealth.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The former secretary of labor examines how our country became the most unequal society in the developed world", "title": "Robert Reich: America\u2019s economy is a nightmare of our own making", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The former secretary of labor examines how our country became the most unequal society in the developed world", "title": "Robert Reich: America\u2019s economy is a nightmare of our own making", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/03/robert_reich_americas_economy_is_a_nightmare_of_our_own_making/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/robert_reich.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The former secretary of labor examines how our country became the most unequal society in the developed world", "title": "Robert Reich: America\u2019s economy is a nightmare of our own making", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/robert_reich.jpg", "creator": "@rbreich", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Robert Reich", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 1 percent, Free Market, Income inequality, RobertReich.org, Wall Street", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Finally and perhaps most significantly, the market explanation cannot account for the decline in wages of recent college graduates.\nIf the market explanation were accurate, college graduates would command higher wages in line with their greater productivity.\nAnd as with intellectual property rights, this market power has simultaneously raised prices and reduced services available to average Americans.\nThe entry-level wages of female college graduates have dropped by more than 8 percent, and male graduates by more than 6.5 percent.\nAt the same time, antitrust laws have been relaxed for corporations with significant market power."}
