"This president has made clear that addressing this opioid epidemic is a priority for him, and this budget reflects this," said Michael Botticelli, the director of National Drug Control Policy under President Barack Obama. Botticelli said that the additional funding request "underscores the urgency of additional action that we need to take."

Botticelli also cited the fact that "we have a tremendous amount of bi-partisan support around this opioid epidemic" as he expressed optimism that the Republican-controlled Congress would approve boosted funding for that fight.

Drug overdoses now kill more people each year than motor vehicle crashes, the White House noted. And new data reveal that the drugs known as opioids, which include prescription pain-killers and heroin, were involved in 28,648 fatalities in 2014.
