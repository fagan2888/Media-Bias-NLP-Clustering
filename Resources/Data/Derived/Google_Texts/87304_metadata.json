(Photo: Rogelio V. Solis/AP)\n\nRobert Gray\u2019s CB handle is \u201cSilent Knight.\u201d\n\nHis new title is Democratic nominee for governor.\n\nGray, a 46-year-old truck driver from Terry, created a political maelstrom Tuesday when he won the nomination. He won without political experience or name recognition. He won despite his campaign finance reports showing zero money raised or spent. He won in spite of too many things to list.\n\nHow?\n\n\u201cI went to a couple rallies. I\u2019m not a people person. I don\u2019t like invading people\u2019s privacy. They knew I was running for governor. I talked to a few people. I got to speak in Meridian. We got like five minutes.\u201d\n\nWith perhaps the most unlikely political victory in modern Mississippi history in his back pocket, Gray moves to November\u2019s general election against incumbent Republican Gov. Phil Bryant.\n\nGray is admittedly shy and doesn\u2019t talk much. He didn\u2019t tell his mother, or any other family or friends, he was running. His mom called him Tuesday and told him she\u2019d voted for him, thinking she\u2019d cast her ballot for a candidate with the same name. By midday Wednesday, Gray said, he had not spoken with friends or family since he secured the nomination.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not every day the average Joe decides to run for governor,\u201d Gray said. \u201cThey know my personality. They know I\u2019m low-key. Jumping into a situation like this, they probably in their wildest imagination never thought it was me.\u201d\n\nHis CB nom de plume is a reflection of his preference to stay quiet. It\u2019s also the perfect descriptor for his candidacy. \u201cI\u2019m here, and nobody knows anything about me,\u201d he said.\n\nThat anonymity will soon evaporate. Gray is unmarried and has no children. He\u2019s a graduate of Provine High School. He attended Hinds Community College and held a series of sales jobs before getting into the trucking business in the 1990s. He owns his own big rig and does business as Fancy Horse Transportation. Gray formed the business in 1998, according to records kept at the secretary of state\u2019s office. The business is in good standing.\n\nHe recently has run over-the-road routes that have taken him to the northeastern United States. Later this week, he\u2019ll haul a load of sweet potatoes to Pennsylvania.\n\nPolitically, Gray sounds a lot like Dr. Valerie Short and Vicki Slater, the two women he beat in Tuesday\u2019s primary. Gray said the state \u201cabsolutely\u201d should expand its Medicaid program under the Affordable Care Act, citing layoffs at hospitals and the need for physicians in the state.\n\nThe Mississippi Adequate Education Program, the formula that determines how much money each school district receives from the state, should be fully funded, too. Gray said he will vote in November for a ballot initiative that would constitutionally mandate full funding of the adequate education formula. (Voting for anything in November would be a divergence for Gray, who admitted personal errands he ran around Jackson on Tuesday kept him from voting.)\n\nEducation and health care have served as talking points for Democrats at every level in Mississippi since the last statewide election cycle.\n\nMore recently, the state flag has entered the discussion. Though a smattering of Republicans \u2014 including House Speaker Philip Gunn \u2014 has endorsed removing the Confederate emblem from the official banner, the majority of anti-flag rhetoric has come from Democrats. Gary added his name Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s no benefit to the state,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the people that want it, it can be their flag, but it can\u2019t represent the state.\u201d\n\nGray would like to discuss the issues with Bryant in a debate. \u201cI figured that was part of the situation,\u201d he said.\n\nState Democratic party officials got the first crack at Gray on Wednesday afternoon. He was scheduled to meet with them after he wrapped up an informal Q&A with media at the Capitol.\n\nGray said he had little contact with party chairman Rickey Cole since campaign season started but did meet him in Meridian.\n\n\u201cI imagine they have a lot of questions for me,\u201d Gray said.\n\nContact Clay Chandler at (601) 961-7264 or cchandler@gannett.com.
