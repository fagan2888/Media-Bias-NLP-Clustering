The closely held corporations before the Supreme Court only objected to four forms of birth control that they equate with abortion, while some plaintiffs in lower courts around the country objected to all forms.\n\nSeventy-one percent of Republicans say they approve of the Hobby Lobby decision, while 70 percent of Democrats say they disapprove.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A closely watched health poll released Friday says more than half the public \u2014 53 percent \u2014 has an unfavorable view of Obamacare, up eight percentage points from a comparable poll in July.", "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A closely watched health poll released Friday says more than half the public \u2014 53 percent \u2014 has an unfavorable view of Obamacare, up eight percentage points from a comparable poll in July.", "title": "Americans don\u2019t like Obamacare, but they\u2019d rather fix it than repeal: poll", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/aug/1/americans-dont-obamacare-theyd-rather-fix-repeal-p/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/04/09/laugh.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/04/09/laugh.jpg", "title": "Americans don\u2019t like Obamacare, but they\u2019d rather fix it t", "description": "A closely watched health poll released Friday says more than half the public \u2014 53 percent \u2014 has an unfavorable view of Obamacare, up eight percentage points from a comparable poll in July.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Social Issues, Politics, Congress"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd10f2\"", "article_summary": "Although Democratic majorities in Congress passed the health care law four years ago, many Americans still don\u2019t understand the basic pillars of the overhaul.\nA closely watched health poll released Friday says more than half the public \u2014 53 percent \u2014 has an unfavorable view of Obamacare, up eight percentage points from a comparable poll in July.\nThe Kaiser Health tracking poll for July said only 37 percent viewed the law favorably.\nRepublicans were less likely (34 percent) than Democrats (43 percent) to say enrollees had a choice among private health plans.\nSeventy-one percent of Republicans say they approve of the Hobby Lobby decision, while 70 percent of Democrats say they disapprove."}
