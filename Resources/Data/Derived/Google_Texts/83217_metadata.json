While the report largely endorses previous studies on the subject, \u201cThe Just-In-Time Professor\u201d document marks the first time Congress has so formally acknowledged a situation that adjunct activists have long deemed exploitative.\n\n\u201cThe contingent faculty trend appears to mirror trends in the general labor market toward a flexible, \u2018just-in-time\u2019 workforce, with lower compensation and unpredictable schedules for what were once considered middle-class jobs,\u201d says the report from the office of Rep. George Miller, the senior committee Democrat, from California. \u201cThe trend should be of concern to policymakers both because of what it means for the living standards and the work lives of those individuals we expect to educate the next generation of scientists, entrepreneurs, and other highly skilled workers, and what it may mean for the quality of higher education itself.\u201d\n\nThe report, based on the anecdotal data from adjuncts and existing research, found that 98 percent of respondents in an online, committee-sponsored forum felt they were \u201cmissing opportunities to better serve their students because of the demands of their schedule.\u201d\n\n\u201cStudents get their work back more slowly and I cannot hold office hours (I only actually have an office in one of the four colleges [I teach at]) and prep is sometimes rushed,\u201d one adjunct respondent wrote. \u201cI am an outstanding teacher and care about the quality of education that my students receive, although the sheer volume of the workload makes it hard.\u201d\n\nAnother wrote: \u201cWhen you pay an adjunct only for the contact hours they spend in the classroom, it doesn\u2019t given adjuncts a lot of motivation to spend extra time outside of class working on projects for students or scheduling extra time to help those who come to class unprepared to study or write at a college level.\u201d\n\nConsistent with existing data, the report says adjuncts are underpaid compared to their tenure-line colleagues and many take on multiple jobs at multiple institutions to make ends meet.\n\nThe median respondent salary was $22,041, below the federal poverty line for a family of four ($23,550), although the typical course load was difficult to ascertain from the online forum (with adjuncts reporting as many as 10 courses per semester). Some 89 percent of respondents teach at two or more institutions, and most can\u2019t depend on assignments from semester to semester. Many also said they relied on help from family members and government assistance to survive, despite having advanced degrees. More than 50 percent of respondents had Ph.D.s and 30 percent held master\u2019s degrees.\n\nRespondents also reported low prospects for advancement to tenure-line or full-time jobs, and 89 percent said they received no professional support for teaching or research from their institutions. The average length of time respondents said they\u2019d worked as an adjunct was 10 years. The median length of time was four years.\n\n\u201cGrowing up in a poor neighborhood \u2026 I believed earning several college degrees would be my path out of poverty, but that is no longer the case,\u201d one adjunct said.\n\nThe report concludes that \u201cadjuncts and other contingent faculty likely make up the most highly educated and experienced workers and on food stamps and other public assistance in the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Just-in-Time Professor\u201d also says low adjunct pay costs taxpayers. According to Congressional Research Service analysis, a family of three in California relying solely on the median adjunct salary would qualify for Medicaid and food stamps, costing $13,645 annually.\n\nRegarding benefits, most online forum respondents \u2013 75 percent \u2013 said they did not have access to health insurance coverage through their employer or employers. Many said their eligibility was linked to the number of course hours they taught, and that those hours did not count the time needed to prepare for class or meet students.\n\n\u201cBenefits are really out of reach at my pay scale,\u201d one adjunct wrote. \u201cThe health care plan that I could buy into costs more than my take-home pay even on a good year (and far more than I earn in an bad year). I don\u2019t earn enough to save for retirement (every month is a struggle just to pay the basic bills). My \u2018retirement\u2019 plan is to work until they bury me.\u201d\n\nMany respondents also expressed outrage at the way their employers were interpreting the so-called employer mandate of the Affordable Care Act, which, starting in January, requires large employers to offer full-time employees health insurance or pay a fine. In response, dozens of institutions across the country have simply capped adjuncts\u2019 maximum course loads to make them ineligible for coverage.\n\n\u201cI was supposed to teach three courses this fall, but the university canceled one of my courses in August, the week before the semester started,\u201d one adjunct wrote. \u201cThe reason was to avoid having to give me any benefits, including health care, due to the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nAnecdotal data was gathered from an online forum announced in November to investigate how the increased employment of adjuncts has impacted their lives, as well as instructional quality. The forum, which closed to comments last month, asked adjuncts to answer the following questions:\n\nFor how long have you worked as a contingent faculty or instructor?\n\nHow would you describe the working conditions of contingent faculty and instructors at your college or university, including matters like compensation, benefits, opportunities for growth and advancement, job stability, and administrative and professional support?\n\nHow do those conditions help or hinder your ability to earn a living and have a stable and successful career in higher education? What impact, if any, do those working conditions have on students or higher education generally?\n\nHow do those working conditions help or hinder your ability to do your job, or how do they otherwise affect students in achieving their educational goals?\n\nSome 845 adjuncts from 41 states responded, although not all answered all questions. But the sample size was big enough for the report to conclude that \u201cthe link between student outcomes and contingent faculty working conditions \u2013 not just the adjuncts\u2019 schedules and compensation but the respect and professional support they receive from their schools \u2013 deserves serious scrutiny from the committee and other policymakers around the country, as well as from institutions of higher education themselves.\u201d\n\nThe report accuses many institutions of choosing to \u201cbalance their budgets on the backs of adjuncts,\u201d and says that \"increased budget transparency\" would be a \"critical step in understanding the nature and necessity of this now-pervasive labor practice and whether and how it may be changed.\"\n\nThe document also endorses the proposed Part-Time Workers Bill of Rights, legislation sponsored by Rep. Jan Schakowsky, an Illinois Democrat, as a way to address many of the concerns stemming from adjuncts' part-time status. The bill extends employers' health insurance responsibility under the Affordable Care Act to part-time workers, among other benefits.\n\nMiller was not available for immediate comment. In a news release, he said the report was far from exhaustive but raised \u201cserious concerns\u201d nonetheless.\n\n\u201cOver the next few months my fellow committee Democrats, my staff, and I intend to work with universities and colleges, committee Republicans, contingent faculty, and their advocates to seek ways to address the troubling issues raised by this report and by contingent faculty across the country,\u201d he said.\n\nMiller\u2019s office offered few additional details as to how the report might lead to action. A spokeswoman said via email: \u201cWe\u2019re still in the early stages of exploring the issues raised through our eForum about the working conditions of adjunct faculty. After publishing the report so that we can share the responses we received, Rep. Miller and his staff will start having conversations with his colleagues on the committee \u2014 both Democratic and Republican \u2014 as well as with interested organizations and other faculty and advocates about the best path forward to address the identified concerns.\u201d\n\nMiller launched the forum after hearing testimony from Maria Maisto, president of the New Faculty Majority, a national adjunct advocacy group, on the impact of the Affordable Care Act on adjunct professors whose hours have been capped by their institutions. At that hearing, in November, Miller said he wanted to hear more about conditions of adjunct employment in general.\n\nVia email, Maisto said she was \u201cgratified\u201d her testimony had played a role in the launching of the forum, and was pleased with the final report.\n\n\u201cThe committee did its research and read the forum submissions with care and concern,\u201d she said, noting the high volume of responses despite the busy time of year for academics. \u201cWe especially appreciate that the committee has begun identifying practical solutions to many of the problems that we and other organizations and researchers have been saying need to be addressed, and we look forward to working with them further on this.\u201d\n\nThe organization will continue reaching out to lawmakers on a regular basis to further address the \u201ccrisis\u201d in higher education, she said.\n\nGary Rhoades, professor and director of the Center for the Study of Higher Education at the University of Arizona, said the report was a \"profoundly important step in policymakers recognizing and addressing the disturbing reality that most professors are not tenured or tenure stream, and are working in precarious positions that often lack health care and pensions, as well as access to basic instructional resources and institutional support.\"\n\nRhoades said he agreed with the report's call for a part-time workers' bill of rights, but said Congress should also act to extend unemployment benefits to adjuncts, who historically have had difficulty getting approval for such assistance when they are without work, such as during the summer. Congress also should work to create incentives for institutions to invest in faculty and instruction, along with disincentives for continued, \"disproportionate\" investment in administrative and other non-instructional costs, he said.\n\nSince launching the forum, Miller has announced he will retire at the end of his term. The spokeswoman said: \u201cWe\u2019ve already seen interest in these questions from Rep. Miller\u2019s colleagues during prior committee hearings, and while Rep. Miller will continue to lead on this issue as the senior Democrat on the committee, we\u2019re confident that others will be engaged in this important topic as we move forward.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/01/24/house-committee-report-highlights-plight-adjunct-professors", "image": "https://www.insidehighered.com/sites/all/themes/ihecustom/images/facebook_icon_large.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A new report on the impact of adjunct labor marks a new level of interest in Washington about the changing nature of the higher education workforce.", "title": "House Committee Report Highlights Plight of Adjunct Professors"}, "msapplication-config": "/IEconfig.xml", "description": "A new report on the impact of adjunct labor marks a new level of interest in Washington about the changing nature of the higher education workforce.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "follow, index"}, "article_summary": "A spokeswoman said via email: \u201cWe\u2019re still in the early stages of exploring the issues raised through our eForum about the working conditions of adjunct faculty.\nWASHINGTON -- It's time for Congress to pay attention to the abuse of adjunct faculty members, and the way their poor working conditions impact not only them, but their students, says a new report from the House Education and the Workforce Committee.\nAt that hearing, in November, Miller said he wanted to hear more about conditions of adjunct employment in general.\nSome 89 percent of respondents teach at two or more institutions, and most can\u2019t depend on assignments from semester to semester.\nMany also said they relied on help from family members and government assistance to survive, despite having advanced degrees."}
