The Republican-controlled Florida Legislature now has two rival maps for Congress.

The Florida Senate voted 28-8 on Wednesday to approve a map that would make dramatic shifts to many of the state's 27 congressional districts.

The Senate proposal has a different configuration for districts in the Tampa Bay area and in central Florida when compared with the House version.

The two sides have until Friday to reach an agreement.

Legislators are holding a special session because the state Supreme Court threw out the existing map. The court in July ruled that lawmakers violated standards adopted by voters that prohibit drawing districts to benefit an incumbent or a member of a political party.

Several incumbent members of Congress could find it difficult to win re-election if the new maps are adopted.
