It isn't clear when Sotomayor or the rest of the court will rule on whether to extend the injunction as the case is appealed.\n\nWhile the Catholic institutions have compared filling out the form to Quakers being forced to join the military, Jewish prisoners being forced to eat pork or Seventh-Day Adventists being forced to work on Saturdays, the government said those were all flawed analogies.\n\n\"To mirror the situation here, the question in all of those cases would be whether the religious objector could be required to sign a certification form in order to secure the religion-based exemption he sought,\" Verrilli wrote.\n\n\"It is applicants\u2019 position, not that of the court of appeals, that would lead to absurd results in those cases, for it would seemingly mean that the Quaker could not be made to attest to his status as a conscientious objector before being absolved of his military obligations; that the Jewish prisoner could not be required to fill out a form saying he had a religious objection to the consumption of pork before he was provided an alternative meal; and that the Seventh Day Adventist could not be obligated to state that he had a religious objection to working on Saturdays before being relieved of his shift.\"\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Health Care Reform Efforts Throughout History Health Care Reform Efforts Throughout History\n\n1 of 17 1912 Former President Theodore Roosevelt champions national health insurance as he unsuccessfully tries to ride his progressive Bull Moose Party back to the White House.
