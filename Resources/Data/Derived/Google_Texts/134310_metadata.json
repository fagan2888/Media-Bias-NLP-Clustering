Last week, Florida unveiled an alternative plan that could allow the state to take advantage of the federal money that\u2019s up for grabs.\n\nWABE\u2019s Michelle Wirth spoke with those on both sides of the federal healthcare debate to see if they think Georgia should come up with a similar plan.\n\nThe Florida plan is being hailed as a \u201cfree market solution.\u201d It was put forward by a group of prominent Republicans and business leaders. The plan would provide coverage for the neediest residents, but they would also be required to pay monthly premiums, get job training or look for work.\n\nCindy Zeldin with Georgians for a Healthy Future is encouraged by the proposal. Her group has advocated strongly for Medicaid expansion.\n\n\u201cThe Florida plan seems to be part of a trend among some states that hadn\u2019t been moving forward last year but now seem to be interested.\u201d\n\nBut Zeldin says her organization dislikes the monthly premiums and job seeking requirements, because she thinks they would provide barriers to access. Still, she hopes the Florida proposal will encourage Georgia lawmakers to come up with their own version. If state leaders develop a Georgia plan she says, \u201cIt\u2019s important that it facilitate access to care and that it be reflective of the Georgia population and the Georgia healthcare system.\u201d\n\nKyle Jackson heads the National Federation of Independent Business here in Georgia. His organization was part of a lawsuit that challenged Obamacare. He says the Florida plan is better than the federal one, but if a similar plan was proposed here Jackson says, \u201cI think any time you\u2019re relying on the federal government to keep a risky promise like this you\u2019re potentially putting the taxpayers and the small business owners of Georgia on the hook. That being said, it hasn\u2019t been balloted yet, so we wouldn\u2019t have an official position.\u201d\n\nDiane Rowland is Executive Vice President of the Kaiser Family Foundation. She says now that the Midterm elections are over, Florida and a number of other states are negotiating with the federal government over Medicaid expansion. If federal officials say yes to their plans, states can take advantage of Medicaid dollars and also meet their political goals.\n\n\u201cIt says they\u2019re doing it their way instead of applying directly to the way the federal government is rolling out the expansion.\u201d\n\nRowland says so far a handful of states have been allowed to move forward with alternatives.\n\nSome states require Medicaid recipients to pay monthly premiums or pay more for frequent trips to the emergency room. Others like Arkansas use federal dollars to buy private insurance. But Rowland says so far the federal government has turned down Medicaid plans with work requirements.\n\nWABE contacted several state lawmakers but they were unavailable for an interview or did not respond by deadline.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics", "description": "Georgia, and many other states with Republican governors, turned down Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act.
