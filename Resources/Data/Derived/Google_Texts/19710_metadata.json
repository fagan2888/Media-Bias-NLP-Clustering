I\u2019ve written numerous articles, dispelled stupid myths and gotten in far too many heated arguments about the misunderstood goth teenager of sexual identities. While I\u2019m done getting in knife fights over whether Willow from \u201cBuffy the Vampire Slayer\u201d was really gay or really bi, I\u2019ve noticed a cultural shift in people\u2019s willingness to use the word \u201cbisexual\u201d as an identity or descriptor of their sexual behaviors (with the exception of surveys and those in the medical establishment).\n\n\u201cBisexual\u201d is increasingly and fervently treated as the worst kind of cooties. Most people who are attracted to more than one gender prefer to identify as anything but bisexual, whether that\u2019s queer, omnisexual, pansexual, homo- or hetero-flexible, straightish, fluid, polysexual, \u201con the down low,\u201d \u201cgay for pay\u201d (e.g. porn) and on and on.\n\nAccording to data from four recent national and two state-level population-based surveys, approximately 9 million Americans identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender (LGBT). Only 1.8 percent of those people identify as bisexual, despite the fact that an estimated 19 million (8.2 percent) report that they have \u201cengaged in same-sex behavior\u201d and 25.6 million (11 percent) who\u2019ve admitted to having same-sex attraction. It\u2019s clear that bisexual behavior is occurring. In a 2013 PEW report on LGBT Americans, bisexuals were far less likely to be out to important people in their lives than lesbians and gays. \u201c77 percent of gay men and 71 percent of lesbians say most or all of the important people in their lives know of their sexual orientation, just 28 percent of bisexuals say the same. Bisexual women are more likely to say this than bisexual men (33 percent vs. 12 percent).\u201d\n\nSimilarly, the (not at all scientific) call I put out on Facebook and Twitter yielded dozens of responses about the problems that bisexuals have with the word bisexual (far more than could fit in this piece), and were full of stories about the difficulties and denigration they have faced because of using the label. So why do people shy away from (if not outright cringe at) the word \u201cbisexual\u201d being applied to them? The problem, I think, is the word itself. Attraction to more than one gender will always exist, of course, but has the word \u201cbisexual\u201d outlived its usefulness? Here are some of the main reasons why it might be time to put the word to bed.\n\nNo one can agree on a definition.\n\n\u201cBisexual\u201d has been around since 1824. Its original use is more akin to androgyny (\u201cshowing characteristics of both sexes\u201d) than anything having to do with sexual behavior. Its common usage (\u201csexual attraction to both men and women\u201d) is one that many feel is reductive (more on that below). Also, there\u2019s confusion about what \u201ccounts\u201d as bisexuality, especially if you are in a committed, monogamous relationship. Is desire enough? What if you\u2019ve slept with a number of women, but only see yourself ending up with a man? What if you\u2019ve never had a same-sex experience, but exclusively fantasize about it? What if you\u2019re 99 percent gay, but would go straight for Beyonce in a heartbeat?\n\nAs Janet W. Hardy, author of The Ethical Slut, told me, \u201cI use the word bisexual for publicity reasons, but it\u2019s both too small and too large for a rather complex set of identities.\u201d When you factor in attraction, history, behavior, identity, and fantasy, you get something that a simple word like \u201cbisexuality\u201d can\u2019t come close to describing with any kind of accuracy. \u201cI don\u2019t like the word because I still don\u2019t fully understand what I am myself, and as soon as I say bisexual I feel like lines have gone down that I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m ready for yet,\u201d wrote one of the respondents, Heidi, in an email.\n\nRampant stereotypes.\n\nAs I\u2019ve written before, admissions of bisexuality are met with a slew of negative connotations and stereotypes. These can include that bisexuals are promiscuous, indecisive, going through a phase, closet cases, taking advantage of straight privilege, want ALL THE THREESOMES, are never satisfied, just experimenting, doing it solely to please men, and so on. As Seth, a male friend, put it, \u201cThe word has more baggage than an airport.\u201d Another described it thusly, \u201cThe word is immediately associated now with cheap, tacky exhibitionism, with drunken one-offs, with out and out sluttiness.\u201d There\u2019s not one positive association with bisexuality, except perhaps that our choices for romantic and sex partners are presumed to be higher. (For the record, it\u2019s not. Twice the probability = twice the likelihood of rejection.)\n\nStereotypes have denigrated the word to the point where it\u2019s basically unsalvageable, in both straight and gay communities. Laura, a Twitter respondent, argued that this is precisely why we should keep bisexuality around. \u201cFor some, I think the difficulty that comes along with the identity forces [bisexuals] to cop out to owning the word, and instead, use terms that are \u2018safer\u2019 or more understood by society. Bisexuals are excluded from hetero-normative society, as well as many gay subcultures. So, I have a hard time saying that the word is no longer useful.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Admissions of \"bisexuality\" are met with a slew of negative stereotypes.
