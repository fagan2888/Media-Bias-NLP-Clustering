And even firms with partners may take time to develop the mindset to create effective partnerships.\n\nBut the effort will be worthwhile for the companies, according to the report, as hospitals shift their attention to lowering costs via performance rather than price.", "article_metadata": {"com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages02.net,3dcadforums.com,3dcadworld.com,analogictips.com,connectortips.com,couplingtips.com,datasheetpro.com,designworldonline.com,devicetalks.com,digitalsignalprocessingtips.com,edaboard.com,eeworldonline.com,electro-tech-online.com,engineeringexchange.com,engineeringwhitepapers.com,fluidpowerworld.com,fpgatips.com,hoseassemblytips.com,linearmotiontips.com,makepartsfast.com,massdevice.com,mcadcentral.com,mechatronictips.com,medicaldesignandoutsourcing.com,microcontrollertips.com,mobilehydraulictips.com,motioncontroltips.com,page.wtwhmedia.com,pneumatictips.com,powerelectronictips.com,sensortips.com,solarpowerworldonline.com,testandmeasurementtips.com,windpowerengineering.com,wireandcabletips.com", "og": {"site_name": "MassDevice", "description": "While the Affordable Care Act could lead to improved partnerships between medtech manufacturers and hospitals, a new survey and report from ZS Associates indicates that hospital execs aren\u2019t convinced that such partnerships\u00a0will help them meet their needs.
