Merrehope kicked off its 46th annual "Trees of Christmas" Sunday.

Beautiful trees with unique themes shine in each room. This year's tour branched out with live music, a book-signing and artwork for sale. It's a tradition that certainly has its roots here. Many in Meridian look forward to visiting every Christmas. Betty Lou Jones explains why the tour is always such a big hit.

"Because it's so much fun and because it gives you the holiday spirit," she says. "We always say get your merry on at Merrehope. It's always something that everyone feels like when trees of Christmas opens then it's time to celebrate the holidays."

You can see the trees and the rest of the home for yourself! Merrehope is open for visitors Monday through Saturday from 10 a.m. until 4 p.m.
