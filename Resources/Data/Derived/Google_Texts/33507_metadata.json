Unfortunately, they are still shaped like a TOS for a credit card. Most of the time, you have no clue what you are signing, and in the case of Peter Drier, you are depending on the doctors to look after your best interest.\n\nThe New York City resident had researched his insurance and understood he was in for some hefty medical bills, but knew the doctors he met would accept a fraction of the medical bill. $56,000 from the Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan, $4,300 from the anesthesiologist and $133,000 from the orthopedist who was performing the three-hour neck surgery.\n\nHis herniated cervical discs had to be repaired, and he had an understanding that the $133,000 would be whittled down to a fraction of what the bill laid out.\n\nThen came the bill that blindsided him. A $117,000 bill from an assistant neurosurgeon that Peter never met. How comforting. Every surgery I\u2019ve had, I have met everyone before going in. This is beyond disconcerting that an assistant neurosurgeon effectively \u2018drives-by\u2019 and assists on a patient they never met.\n\nThe main problem with this, is you have doctors performing on patients without prior consent. It isn\u2019t unusual for doctors to bring in outside help, but the reasoning is clear. Money. These doctors are primarily out of network. That equals an incredible amount of charges. Up to 40 times what an in-network doctor can charge.\n\nNotice the assistants fee is nearly that of the orthopedist? That\u2019s no accident. It is an end around of the current health insurance landscape. The Affordable Care Act is turning out to be not so affordable if you accidentally go out-of-network. The drive-by doctoring is contributing to the $2.8 trillion in nation\u2019s health costs.\n\nThe rash of out-of-network charges has caused insurance companies to take up cases of patients. You know it\u2019s bad when an insurance company is calling foul.\n\nThe issue? Financial concerns. That\u2019s the new age way of saying lobbyists are halting any fixes in the system. The ACA may have opened up insurance to more patients, but it also closed off numerous paths to care for patients. Increased premiums and less care, what\u2019s not to love?\n\nCurrently, there are no laws on the books to force hospitals to join an in-network system to provide doctors, labs and other diagnostic tests. In Mr. Drier\u2019s case, he complained to Aetna, his provider. The insurance company agreed that it wasn\u2019t his responsibility, but still cut the check to the assistant.\n\nAll this does is encourage the practice. It isn\u2019t just surgeries. Many ERs now are staffed by contractors who bill separately. So you roll into the ER for an emergency and it turns out you have a line of contractors who are going to load you down with medical bills.\n\nHow to fix the system? The Affordable Care Act needs safeguards in place to prevent this type of abuse. Patients have rights, and this is a blatant attempt at a money grab. Like all government programs, people are always looking for a way to skirt the law to line their pockets. It\u2019s not only dangerous, but wildly unethical.\n\nRead the full piece at the New York Times.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The New York City resident had researched his insurance and understood he was in for some hefty bills, but knew the doctors he met would accept a fraction of the medical bill.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "News Ledge", "description": "The New York City resident had researched his insurance and understood he was in for some hefty bills, but knew the doctors he met would accept a fraction of the medical bill.", "title": "Insane Surgical Medical Bill Greets Peter Drier.
