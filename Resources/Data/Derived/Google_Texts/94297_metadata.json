Its ACO pullback, announced in May , comes after the insurer made an early and aggressive push into Medicare\u2019s fledgling accountable care initiative, which has mushroomed to more than 300 ACOs since 2012 despite limited results, a rocky start and ongoing operating challenges. CMS officials have described growth of the program as a priority, which includes continued participation by the first ACOs. Accountable care is one of a few Affordable Care Act policies to experiment with healthcare financing reform.Universal American operates 30 Medicare ACOs after its recent exits and the merger of two ACOs, Waegelein said. Executives are waiting on the expected September release of final first-year results of ACOs that began in 2012 for more information to make decisions, he said.Waegelein and Universal American CEO Richard Barasch stressed that the company won\u2019t completely abandon the model.\u201cWe remain firmly committed to our ACO business,\u201d Barasch told analysts during a conference call to announce Universal American\u2019s financial performance in the second quarter. Early ACO results suggest some success among the company\u2019s ACOs at reducing hospital visits, readmissions and emergency room use, he said. The company is expected to earn revenue from its ACOs and will benefit from skills developed under the program, he said.\u201cEven though the results are emerging slower than we had hoped, we believe we are building a distinctive and important business for Universal American.\u201d Barasch said. \u201cThe skills that we and our physician partners are learning will no doubt prove to be valuable as payment reform continues.\u201dBarasch added that Universal American is using case management and data analytics to bolster the performance of its ACOs, but he also reiterated that the company will withdraw from the ones that still struggle. \u201cWe are continuing to reduce the size and scope of our investments to focus on those ACOs where the (shared-savings) program can work and we can truly impact the cost and quality of medical care.\u201dOperating costs for the company\u2019s ACOs for the second quarter dropped to $10 million from $13.1 million in the first quarter as startup costs ebbed for its more established networks. Through last December, the company\u2019s ACO expenses totaled $63 million.The company reported a net loss of $9.8 million on revenue of $519 million during the second quarter.Executives are also waiting on proposed rules for future Medicare accountable care contracts, which typically last three years. ACOs have cited policies under existing contracts, such as how patients are included in an ACO, as obstacles to achieving financial incentives under the program. \u201cWe expect them to improve on some areas where we had challenges,\u201d said Waegelein, though he declined to be more specific ahead of the proposed rules.Follow Melanie Evans on Twitter: @MHmevans", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#0a365e", "description": "Insurer Universal American, the largest operator of Medicare accountable care organizations, has exited three ACOs and may drop more as the company sheds poorly performing or fringe businesses, said executives with the publicly traded insurer.", "title": "Universal American's zeal for ACOs is fading", "og": {"site_name": "Modern Healthcare", "description": "Insurer Universal American, the largest operator of Medicare accountable care organizations, has exited three ACOs and may drop more as the company sheds poorly performing or fringe businesses, said executives with the publicly traded insurer.", "title": "Universal American's zeal for ACOs is fading", "url": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20140729/NEWS/307299960", "image": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CH/20140729/NEWS/307299960/AR/0/AR-307299960.jpg&maxw=1200&maxh=630", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com", "description": "Insurer Universal American, the largest operator of Medicare accountable care organizations, has exited three ACOs and may drop more as the company sheds poorly performing or fringe businesses, said executives with the publicly traded insurer.", "creator": "@modrnhealthcr", "image": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CH/20140729/NEWS/307299960/AR/0/AR-307299960.jpg&imageversion=thumbnail&maxw=240&maxh=240", "title": "Universal American's zeal for ACOs is fading", "site": "@modrnhealthcr", "card": "summary"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Modern Healthcare", "published_at": "2014-07-29", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "url": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20140729/NEWS/307299960", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "msapplication-TileImage": "https:/raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/ms-touch-icon-144x144-precomposed.png", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "image": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CH/20140729/NEWS/307299960/AR/0/AR-307299960.jpg&maxw=360&maxh=240", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf83d\"", "article_summary": "Early ACO results suggest some success among the company\u2019s ACOs at reducing hospital visits, readmissions and emergency room use, he said.\nCMS officials have described growth of the program as a priority, which includes continued participation by the first ACOs.\nACOs have cited policies under existing contracts, such as how patients are included in an ACO, as obstacles to achieving financial incentives under the program.\nUniversal American\u2019s core business is in Medicare Advantage.\nAccountable care is one of a few Affordable Care Act policies to experiment with healthcare financing reform.Universal American operates 30 Medicare ACOs after its recent exits and the merger of two ACOs, Waegelein said."}
