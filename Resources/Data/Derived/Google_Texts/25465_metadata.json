Chris Christie has jumped on the bandwagon. He\u2019s not a fan of President Barack Obama\u2019s latest ad pushing the uninsured to sign up for the Affordable Care Act, either.\n\nEarlier this week, the president\u2019s Twitter account tweeted an image of a man in what appears to be red footie pajamas with a mug in his hands. The caption reads: \u201cWear pajamas. Drink hot chocolate. Talk about getting health care.\u201d\n\nHow do you plan to spend the cold days of December? http://t.co/Rwf5AYc3bG #GetTalking pic.twitter.com/PBQ397yLf4 \u2014 Barack Obama (@BarackObama) December 17, 2013\n\nThe ad set off quite an uproar on Twitter, with many users labeling the man in the image \u201cpajama boy,\u201d and ripping Obama. Others seemed to look at the ad as an act of desperation and that\u2019s understandable considering a recent CBSNews/New York Times poll revealed that 34 percent of people without health care believe the Affordable Care Act will harm them and 46 percent said it will have no change on their lives whatsoever.\n\nChristie, the Republican governor of New Jersey, jumped into the fray on Wednesday. He was at a soup kitchen in Paterson as part of his administration\u2019s \u201cSeason of Service\u201d initiative. He later took to Twitter and mimicked the president\u2019s ad, firing off a tweet stressing volunteerism.\n\nIn New Jersey, we are spending the cold days of December volunteering. #GetOutOfYourPJs #SeasonOfService pic.twitter.com/yhtwDpy2cQ \u2014 Governor Christie (@GovChristie) December 18, 2013\n\nThe two hashtags Christie used in the tweet, \u201cGetOutOfYourPJs\u201d and \u201cSeasonofService,\u201d were immediately trending on the social media site.\n\nSome Democrats were critical of Christie\u2019s response, which seems more about the governor showing his might to the White House during a time of high speculation that he\u2019ll run for president in 2016, than it does guiding his state.\n\nThe Christie administration, along with Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s administration in New York, was criticized earlier this week for not being more hands-on in its overseeing of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey during emergency construction on the George Washington Bridge, which on three occasions over the last few weeks has led to epic evening commute traffic delays and backups stretching as far as 20 miles.\n\nChristie has also been fending off a potential scandal involving lane closures at the GWB, that some have said were a product of political retribution.\n\nYou May Also Be Interested In These Stories", "article_metadata": {"description": "Chris Christie has jumped on the bandwagon.
