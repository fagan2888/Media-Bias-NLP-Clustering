How much more will it cost the O\u2019Malley-Brown administration to fix or totally replace the dysfunctional online health insurance system that it bragged about until the software crashed on Day One?\n\nIt already is the most costly debacle in state history.\n\nNone of the state\u2019s options are appetizing. Meanwhile, problems keep mounting, the latest being $30 million in extra taxpayer expenses due to the Internet computer software\u2019s inability to identify recipients no longer eligible for free Medicaid insurance.\n\nJust fixing this deeply flawed software will cost untold tens of millions of dollars. Moving to a new, proven system used in another state could send new spending into the stratosphere. Converting to the federal system has heavy costs as well as severe limitations and the potential for more breakdowns.\n\nFrantic scramble\n\n\u201cIt seems like we\u2019re shooting in the dark,\u201d said an exasperated Del. Addie Eckardt, an Eastern Shore Republican at a hearing last week. She\u2019s right.\n\nState officials have been frantically scrambling ever since the administration\u2019s highly touted online system froze and refused to work as promised on Oct. 1.\n\nOfficials are still grasping for straws, hoping the new prime contractor can make lemonade out of this lemon of an IT jalopy.\n\nAs for the next step once insurance enrollment closes on March 31, it\u2019s another shot in the dark. Whatever the choice, it will be very expensive.\n\nBut will it work? There\u2019s no guarantee that it will.\n\nWhat a mess.\n\nLooming loss of federal fnds\n\nComplicating matters is the looming end of federal largesse. Come 2015, the state is supposed to foot the entire bill for its health insurance exchange.\n\nMaryland has expended $182 million in federal funds with little to show for it. How much the state will be on the hook after Jan. 1 is another unknown, but we do know it will no longer by Martin O\u2019Malley\u2019s problem.\n\nWhat a distasteful present he\u2019s leaving on his successor\u2019s desk.\n\nIt\u2019s baffling that no one running the administration is insisting on an immediate and thorough investigation of this historic screw-up. This won\u2019t be viewed favorably by future historians.\n\nNot only is accountability lacking but the O\u2019Malley-Brown administration is running away from this question as fast as it can.\n\nWhere\u2019s Anthony Brown?\n\nNote that Lt. Gov. Anthony Brown, the widely promoted point man on healthcare reform, continues to be missing in action. Yet he owes the Maryland public a full and frank explanation of his central role in this debacle.\n\nHow this affects Brown\u2019s candidacy for governor remains of pivotal importance.\n\nDoes his \u201cdeer caught in headlights\u201d performance disqualify him from serious consideration?\n\nIs this the type of evasiveness on vital issues we can expect from him if he\u2019s elected governor?\n\nDo we want a governor who takes cover when controversies rage and lets underlings take the heat for him?\n\nAs Desi Arnaz famously said to Lucy, Brown has got \u201csome \u2018splainin\u2019 to do.\u201d\n\nMore sinkholes ahead?\n\nMeanwhile, legislative committees continue to treat this disgraceful public embarrassment with kid gloves. History will not look kindly on their performance, either.\n\nDigging out of this enormous sinkhole hasn\u2019t been easy. The road ahead looks susceptible to similar perils.\n\nWhat\u2019s lacking is responsible, accountable leadership. That could become a dominant bone of contention as the June 24 primary approaches.\n\nRead other columns by Barry Rascovar at www.politicalmaryland.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "How high will it go?
