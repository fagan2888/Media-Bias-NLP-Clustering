This editorial appears on page two of the July issue of National Right to Life News. The 36-page issue can be read in its entirety (and forwarded from) www.nrlc.org/uploads/NRLNews/NRLNewsJuly2014.pdf\n\nThere is enough terrain to cover since the June issue of National Right to Life News that the July issue could be half-again as large. However any editorial overview would be remiss if we didn\u2019t start with a few words about the jam-packed National Right to Life Convention which took place June 26-28 in Louisville.\n\nWe\u2019ve devoted a lot of coverage to what more than one individual called the \u201cbest convention ever,\u201d beginning on page 10. That includes three pages of beautiful photos, taken by Bill Molitor.\n\nBill neatly captured the joy and the enthusiasm and the earnestness of the audiences which filled not only the general sessions, the Prayer Breakfast, and the closing Banquet, but also the 64 workshops as well. Whatever the \u201cperfect storm\u201d in reverse might be, that\u2019s what took place at the historic Galt House Hotel. Many, many good things came together to produce a memorable gathering of what Dr. Jean Garton calls \u201cAmerica\u2019s pro-life family.\u201d (See particularly, the stories on pages ten and sixteen.)\n\nThere were two Supreme Court cases which came down, one the Monday after the convention (the \u201cHobby Lobby\u201d case). It is very important that you carefully read NRLC\u2019s analysis which begins on page one.\n\nNo victory for religious conscience rights, however modest, is to be minimized. At this juncture we cannot know how aggressively the Obama administration will attempt to reverse that \u201csetback.\u201d But given this Administration\u2019s hostility to religious liberties, we can only expect the worse.\n\nHaving said that, from our single-issue perspective, \u201cthe ruling does not truly correct any of the major abortion-expanding problems created by Obamacare,\u201d as NRLC pointed out. For example, the Court\u2019s ruling in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby \u201ccomes nowhere near to correcting the heart of the problem,\u201d which is the overly expansive authority that the Obamacare law itself provides to HHS to define \u201cpreventive services.\u201d\n\nBack in 2010 when the battle over Obamacare was hottest, National Right to Life reminded all parties that HHS could use its \u201cpreventive services\u201d mandate to require that most employers also provide coverage for surgical abortions, or for doctor-prescribed suicide, that would be just as expansive as the contraceptive mandate issued by HHS. Nothing in the decision addressed that ominous prospect.\n\nAnd, as NRLC also made clear, not even at issue before the High Court in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby were the other major abortion-expanding provisions of Obamacare. That would include the massive tax subsidies that will assist millions of Americans to purchase health plans that cover elective abortion.\n\n\u201cOnly comprehensive legislative reform can cure the multiple abortion-expanding components of Obamacare \u2013 and such reform can only be accomplished with new leadership in the U.S. Senate and in the White House,\u201d NRLC warned.\n\nWhich brings to mind pro-abortion Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (R-Nv.) and pro-abortion former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who is customarily listed as the #1 candidate (as of now) to be her party\u2019s presidential nominee in 2016.\n\nIf you read the story on page 7, you can come away with only one conclusion. Senator Reid will say anything to try to keep pro-abortion Democrats in charge of the Senate. As POLITICO (which is highly sympathetic to Democrats) observed, Reid\u2019s \u201cunscripted attacks can veer into bellicosity and take liberties with facts.\u201d\n\nReid is so over the top that his \u201cattacks have drawn cries of McCarthyism from around the political world, including MSNBC host Joe Scarborough and Mother Jones editor Daniel Schulman.\u201d His demagoguery is nothing new, it is just more obviously on display with Republican Senate prospects this fall looking bright.\n\nSecretary Clinton (as we discuss on page 7) seemingly can\u2019t stop stepping on her own tongue. Who could possibly have advised one-half of the ultimate power couple, whose net worth is probably in the hundreds of millions, to describe the Clintons\u2019 condition as they left the White House as \u201cdead broke,\u201d indeed \u201cin debt\u201d? Or suggest it would be okay to get huffy when a sympathetic NPR type simply asks her to explain when and why Clinton changed her position on gay rights? Or fail to remind her the proper names of the major political parties in England, a huge gaffe. And so on and so on.\n\nAnd we could talk further about President Obama\u2019s plunging fortunes, building on the story on page 6. It was just a couple of weeks ago that the public rated him the worst President since World War II\u2014and with good cause. People are catching on that (a) Obama gives every appearance of having checked out, more than two years before his second term ends, and (b) he simply is in over his head. But Obama\u2019s fortunes have continued to sink, with absolutely no reason to believe he can turn things around. No wonder vulnerable Democrats are keeping him at arm\u2019s length!\n\nThe July NRL News covers state developments (mostly good!), doctor-prescribed suicide (mostly awful) at the same time we keep track of what only be described as the increasingly bizarre comments coming from various wings of the pro-abortion Movement. You literally can\u2019t make this stuff up.\n\nTo believe that you will embolden women to \u201cspeak up\u201d about their abortion by videotaping your own abortion and putting it on YouTube? (See Emily Letts). Or reduce the inherent moral tension that is part of a life-and-death decision to a punch line in a movie whose \u201cheroine\u201d (Donna Stern) is a foul-mouthed comic with the moral maturity of a prepubescent whose idea of the ultimate punch line goes like this:\n\nStern is about to perform her comedy act the night before her abortion. Her friend Nellie tells her, \u201cYou are going to kill it out there.\u201d Donna jokes back, \u201cI\u2019m actually going to do that tomorrow.\u201d\n\nDoubtless some people will find this humorous.\n\nBut fundamentally, this issue, like all editions of the \u201cpro-life newspaper of record,\u201d is built on hope, faith, and charity. We have hope that your kindness to women in crisis pregnancies will assist them in their hour of desperation to choose life. And for those women who have made a tragically wrong decision, we will be there to help them deal with the regret, the remorse, and the self-recriminations.\n\nThose of us at National Right to Life, like you reading this editorial, have faith that the better angels of our nature will eventually win out. Why? Simply because abortion is intrinsically horrible, a wound on our consciences which can never be healed until we confront the evil.\n\nAnd charity\u2014love\u2014even for those like Jenny Slate who played Donna Stern, and Emily Letts, whose moral confusion is as cavernously deep as it is profoundly sad. What can she possibly be thinking when she tells one reporter\n\n\u201cYes, I do realize it was potential life. I have a special relationship with my ultrasound. People say it sounds weird, it\u2019s my process. I realize it was potential life, and I love it in my own special way. I\u2019m not glib and cavalier. I\u2019m comfortable with my decisions.\u201d\n\nAnd then add later (in a post on the Cosmopolitan magazine website)\n\n\u201cI know that sounds weird, but to me, this was as birth-like as it could be. It will always be a special memory for me. I still have my sonogram, and if my apartment were to catch fire, it would be the first thing I\u2019d grab.\u201d\n\nIt may be too late for people like Slate and Letts, but perhaps not. Either way, we would never, could never give up trying to help cause the scales to fall from their eyes.\n\nWe owe that to those trapped in darkness and to all the little ones who lives we are pledged to try to save.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://www.nationalrighttolifenews.org/news/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/HHSmandate-300x280.jpg"}, "bitly-verification": "3d313669c834"}, "article_summary": "This editorial appears on page two of the July issue of National Right to Life News.\nWhich brings to mind pro-abortion Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (R-Nv.)\nThose of us at National Right to Life, like you reading this editorial, have faith that the better angels of our nature will eventually win out.\nHowever any editorial overview would be remiss if we didn\u2019t start with a few words about the jam-packed National Right to Life Convention which took place June 26-28 in Louisville.\nIt is very important that you carefully read NRLC\u2019s analysis which begins on page one."}
