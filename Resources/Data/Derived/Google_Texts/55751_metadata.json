However unlike other leading causes of 30-day readmissions and patient deaths, the medical condition has not been singled out for special attention under provisions of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nWhile sepsis accounts for just as many readmissions and deaths as heart attacks and congestive heart failure, it costs health providers as much to treat as both of those disorders combined, according to a UCLA study published in Critical Care Medicine.\n\n\"Our study shows how common sepsis readmissions are and some of the factors that are associated with higher risk of readmission after these severe infections,\" study author Dong Chang, M.D., of the UCLA Clinical and Translational Science Institute, said in an announcement. \"We show that sepsis readmissions have a significant impact on healthcare expenditures relative to other high-risk conditions that are receiving active attention and interventions.\"\n\nChang and his team analyzed data from acute care, non-federal hospitals in California and found that from 2009 to 2011, among adults 18 and older, there were a total of 240,198 admissions for sepsis, 193,153 for congestive heart failure and 105,684 for heart attacks.\n\nFor 30-day readmissions, sepsis accounted for 20.4 percent of cases. The rates for congestive heart failure were 23.6 percent and for heart attacks, 17.7 percent. UCLA estimated the annual cost of sepsis-related readmissions in California during the study period was $500 million, whereas congestive heart failure accounted for $229 million and heart attacks cost the system $142 million.\n\n\"Sepsis is a leading contributor to excess healthcare costs due to hospital readmissions,\" the researchers concluded. \"Interventions at clinical and policy levels should prioritize identifying effective strategies to reduce sepsis readmissions.\"\n\nPossible interventions include better training for hospital personnel to spot risk factors and early symptoms of sepsis, an emphasis on patient learning with regards to the importance of following aftercare instructions and taking all medications, and a global effort to better understand sepsis and develop new treatment strategies and medicines to combat the condition, FierceHealthcare previously reported.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the study abstract\n\n- read the announcement\n\nRelated Articles\n\nSepsis rivals pneumonia, heart failure for readmissions\n\nWhat hospitals can do to tackle the deadly threat of sepsis\n\nSepsis contributes to half of hospital deaths\n\nEarly, personalized interventions could prevent sepsis readmissions\n\nHospitals, government take on sepsis and other drug-resistant infections\n\nSepsis mortality rates on the decline", "article_metadata": {"description": "While sepsis accounts for just as many readmissions and deaths as heart attacks and congestive heart failure, it costs health providers as much to treat as both of those disorders combined,\u00a0according to\u00a0a UCLA study published in\u00a0Critical Care Medicine.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "While sepsis accounts for just as many readmissions and deaths as heart attacks and congestive heart failure, it costs health providers as much to treat as both of those disorders combined,\u00a0according to\u00a0a UCLA study published in\u00a0Critical Care Medicine.", "title": "Sepsis major driver of readmissions, mortality and costs", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/sepsis-major-driver-readmissions-mortality-and-costs/2015-07-09", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Affordable Care Act ACA,Care Delivery,congestive heart failure (CHF),heart attacks,hospital mortality rates,hospital readmissions,hospital-acquired conditions (HAC),Patient Care & Outcomes,Sepsis,sepsis mortality rates", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "article_summary": "\"Sepsis is a leading contributor to excess healthcare costs due to hospital readmissions,\" the researchers concluded.\nThe rates for congestive heart failure were 23.6 percent and for heart attacks, 17.7 percent.\nFor 30-day readmissions, sepsis accounted for 20.4 percent of cases.\n\"We show that sepsis readmissions have a significant impact on healthcare expenditures relative to other high-risk conditions that are receiving active attention and interventions.\"\n\"Interventions at clinical and policy levels should prioritize identifying effective strategies to reduce sepsis readmissions.\""}
