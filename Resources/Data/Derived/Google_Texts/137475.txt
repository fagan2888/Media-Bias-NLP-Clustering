He won 21 races last season and now he’s won in Tucson.

Jonathan Davenport took the checkered flag Sunday on night #2 of the Wild West Shootout at USA Raceway.

The Lucas Oil Late Model Dirt Series points champ rebounded from a shaky performance on opening night that saw him place fifth in the main race.

Don O’Neal took the honors on Saturday which means no one will claim a $250,000 bonus that would have been paid out to a driver who could win all six-races in the late model division at this winter mini-series.

Nightly winners take home a paycheck of $5,000 with the exception of next Sunday night’s finale which will carry a purse of $11,000.

O’Neal and Davenport can still win a $100,000 bonus if either can sweep the next four nights of racing.

The event resumes on Wednesday night (Jan. 13th) and concludes with racing next weekend (Jan. 15-17).

Several local drivers are competing in the field including Jake O’Neil, Sean Bray, Greg Jelvik, Bucky Andrews, Dana Fite, R.C. Whitwell and James Laing.
