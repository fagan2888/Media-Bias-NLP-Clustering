That\u2019s 15.2 million people employed in doctors\u2019 offices, hospitals and home care on a seasonally adjusted basis, the Labor Department said Friday, up from 14.7 million a year earlier.\n\nThere are two main trends behind the jump. As the U.S. population gets older, its health-care needs are increasing. And hospitals and doctors got millions of new customers under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which gave people subsidies to buy coverage and required many employers to provide insurance.\n\nIn 2014, about 53.8 million people got coverage from Medicare, the U.S. health program for the elderly and disabled. That\u2019s up from 52.3 million in 2013, and 41.7 million a decade earlier. The Census Bureau projects that about a quarter of the U.S. population, or 88 million people, will be 65 or older in 2050, up from about 13 percent of the population now.\n\nAs the economy improved and insurance-coverage rules kicked in from the Affordable Care Act, more people gained insurance coverage. The proportion of the population with insurance was 88.5 percent at the end of last year, up from 85.6 percent a year earlier. The rate had hovered around 85 percent for more than a decade, though it fell as people lost jobs in the recession.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Zachary Tracer,Drew Armstrong", "twitter": {"description": "Health-care jobs hit a record as a percentage of total non-farm employment in the most recent U.S. payrolls report, fueled by an improving economy and President Barack Obama\u2019s health-care overhaul.", "title": "Health Jobs Hit U.S. Record, Driven by Economy and Obamacare", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-04/health-jobs-hit-u-s-record-driven-by-economy-and-obamacare", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iQpH4xIi7CDU/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "site": "@business", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-author": "Drew Armstrong", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "Employment,Jobs,Health", "news_keywords": "Employment,Jobs,Health", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-04/health-jobs-hit-u-s-record-driven-by-economy-and-obamacare", "parsely-title": "Health Jobs Hit U.S. Record, Driven by Economy and Obamacare", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-09-04T16:55:47.078Z", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "Health-care jobs hit a record as a percentage of total non-farm employment in the most recent U.S. payrolls report, fueled by an improving economy and President Barack Obama\u2019s health-care overhaul.", "parsely-tags": "Employment,Jobs,Health,Region: Global,Page: article", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.bwbx.io/business/public/images/favicons/mstile-144x144-bbd2101292.png", "date": "2015-09-04T16:55:47.078Z", "parsely-section": "science-energy", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "og": {"site_name": "Bloomberg.com", "description": "Health-care jobs hit a record as a percentage of total non-farm employment in the most recent U.S. payrolls report, fueled by an improving economy and President Barack Obama\u2019s health-care overhaul.", "title": "Health Jobs Hit U.S. Record, Driven by Economy and Obamacare", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-04/health-jobs-hit-u-s-record-driven-by-economy-and-obamacare", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iQpH4xIi7CDU/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "type": "website"}, "fb": {"status": "Health-care jobs hit a record as a percentage of total non-farm employment in the most recent U.S. payrolls report, fueled by an improving economy and President Barack Obama\u2019s health-care overhaul."}, "parsely-post-id": "NU5V4V6KLVRP01", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "parsely-image-url": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iQpH4xIi7CDU/v1/-1x-1.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde4cb\"", "article_summary": "Health-care jobs hit a record as a percentage of total non-farm employment in the most recent U.S. payrolls report, fueled by an improving economy and President Barack Obama\u2019s health-care overhaul.\nAs the economy improved and insurance-coverage rules kicked in from the Affordable Care Act, more people gained insurance coverage.\nHealth jobs made up 10.7 percent of all jobs in August.\nIn 2014, about 53.8 million people got coverage from Medicare, the U.S. health program for the elderly and disabled.\nThe rate had hovered around 85 percent for more than a decade, though it fell as people lost jobs in the recession."}
