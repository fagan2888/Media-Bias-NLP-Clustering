Giolito\u2019s father was working for Electronic Arts at the time. The company was collaborating with Baker. Little Lucas, far from the 6-foot-6 elite pitching prospect he is now, provided a past with the man who could be his first manager in the major leagues.\n\nBaker meets a lot of people. A day after Baker\u2019s son asked if he had met Giolito yet, the manager and prospect were introduced. Giolito told Baker his tale, hopeful he would remember him. He didn\u2019t. That was a long time ago.\n\n\u201cYou start feeling old after a while,\u201d Baker said. \u201cHe [was] 6 years old, now he\u2019s 6-6.\u201d\n\nGiolito, ranked No. 5 in Baseball America\u2019s list of the top 100 prospects in minor league baseball, is in his first big-league camp. The Washington Nationals invited him to Viera this spring to get a sense of how things operate at the highest level.\n\nWashington is still protective of the 21-year-old who had Tommy John surgery in 2012. He was limited to 117 innings pitched last season. That number should grow this summer, most likely in the minors. Something dramatic would have to happen for Giolito to break camp with the Nationals.\n\nSo, he\u2019s using the six weeks with the big club to absorb coaching and what veterans can show him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to try to be a little bit of a fly on the wall,\u201d Giolito said. \u201cJust keep my ears open. I don\u2019t want to annoy anybody.\u201d\n\nHis fastball command is a priority. Giolito said he wants to work both sides of the plate for better fastball strikes. He felt his mid-90s fastball was left over the middle too often last season.\n\nGiolito arrived a few days earlier to become acclimated. He settled into his apartment and was dressed Saturday morning, the first day of official workouts, almost too soon. He huddled with teammates, then waited by his locker, letting the clock head toward the start of his first big league camp.\n\nGiolito said he was excited as opposed to nervous. His end game for this year was clear.\n\n\u201cMy goal is to definitely reach the big leagues,\u201d Giolito said. \u201cThere\u2019s certain aspects \u2014 baseball\u2019s a business. At the same time, I feel like if I continue to progress the way I want to, then I\u2019ll have a good shot.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Giolito, appearing in the Nationals' big-league camp for the first time, is hoping to pitch well enough this spring to make even more of an impression on new manager Dusty Baker.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Giolito, appearing in the Nationals\u2019 big-league camp for the first time, is hoping to pitch well enough this spring to make even more of an impression on new manager Dusty Baker.", "title": "Nationals\u2019 Lucas Giolito targets making the major leagues this season", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/feb/20/nationals-lucas-giolito-targets-making-major-leagu/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/02/20/Nationals_Spring_Baseball.JPEG-0d315.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/02/20/Nationals_Spring_Baseball.JPEG-0d315.jpg", "description": "Giolito, appearing in the Nationals' big-league camp for the first time, is hoping to pitch well enough this spring to make even more of an impression on new manager Dusty Baker.", "card": "summary", "title": "Nationals\u2019 Lucas Giolito targets making the major leagues this s"}, "Author": "Todd Dybas", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Lucas Giolito"}, "article_summary": "A day after Baker\u2019s son asked if he had met Giolito yet, the manager and prospect were introduced.\nVIERA, Fla. \u2014 Lucas Giolito had a story for a man who has a story for everything.\nWhen Giolito was around 4 or 5 years old, he met Dusty Baker.\n\u201cMy goal is to definitely reach the big leagues,\u201d Giolito said.\nLittle Lucas, far from the 6-foot-6 elite pitching prospect he is now, provided a past with the man who could be his first manager in the major leagues."}
