A diplomat from a small Pacific island that faces imminent inundation might, understandably, have focused on the elimination of fossil-fuel subsidies, while one from China or India might have stressed the transfer of environmentally sound technologies to developing countries on favorable terms. By themselves, these are both worthy causes, but a result of accommodating these divergent priorities is a list with 17 goals and 169 targets as metrics for measuring progress toward those goals \u2014 a sort of \u201c169 times good cake.\u201d\n\nThe previous Millennium Development Goals, established in 2000 with a target date of 2015, set only eight broad goals \u2014 like universal primary education, gender equality and environmental sustainability \u2014 as priorities for global resources, and just 19 targets.\n\nThe power of the original millennium goals came from their very clear prioritization of a small number of measurable objectives. The idea was to present to the world a specific vision that said, \u201cThis much at least we should be able to offer every human being.\u201d By emphasizing the sheer modesty of what was being proposed, it made it hard for nation states to ignore the global project.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhat is needed now is a clear, concise set of objectives. Without them, the entire project is in very real danger of failing. If nations can simply ignore the imperatives on the grounds that they are too many, too grandiose and too far out of touch with countries\u2019 limited resources and ability to effect change, the development goals will just be another pious hope in the long list of United Nations-sponsored fantasies.\n\nWe have some experience of just how difficult choosing priorities can be. We were both involved in the High-Level Panel for the Post-2015 Development Agenda, a group set up by the secretary general that worked in parallel to the Open Working Group. We submitted our report \u2014 which will be combined with the Open Working Group\u2019s \u2014 in May last year, and despite our attempts to discipline ourselves ruthlessly, we ended up with 12 goals and 54 targets.\n\nChoices have to be made. Some are easier than others: For example, \u201cDevise and implement policies to promote sustainable tourism\u201d (Target 8.9 in the diplomats\u2019 proposal), laudable as it is as an objective, cannot possibly lay the same claim to our attention as infant mortality or mass illiteracy.\n\nThe list of targets could also be shortened by focusing on outcomes and leaving out process or input measures (the current version has both). This has the added advantage of allowing countries to use their limited resources as they see fit. For example, we think it is much better to have a quantitative target for children\u2019s learning (e.g., by 2030, X percent of children should be reading or doing math at their grade level) than to require them to \u201cincrease by X percent the supply of qualified teachers\u201d (Target 4.c in the working group proposal), especially given the lack of evidence that teacher training as currently delivered has much effect on children\u2019s learning.\n\nMoreover, the goals and targets should be as specific, measurable and actionable as possible. For example, Target 12.2 in the proposal asks countries to \u201cby 2030 achieve sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources.\u201d Who would argue with that, but what does it actually require countries to do other than to say amen?\n\nFinally, our report indicated some issues that apply to many goals. Inequality was one. The idea was that for a range of goals, countries would have to measure and report the outcomes \u2014 for example, infant mortality \u2014 for the poorest X percent (say, 20 percent) of the population, in addition to the average.\n\nThis is where we find a lot of the historically disadvantaged populations (the Roma in Europe, \u201cscheduled tribes,\u201d as the indigenous people in India are known, African-Americans) and help bring some attention to subpopulations without focusing on ethnicity directly.\n\nIt also makes it harder for countries to concentrate just on people close to the poverty line and ignore those far below and points to overlooked communities in the richest countries.\n\nThe United Nations General Assembly has its work cut out. It must balance ambition with practicality. It must devise a tight agenda for the world to collectively strive toward \u2014 and remember that more ingredients do not always make the best cake.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAbhijit Banerjee is the international professor of economics at M.I.T.
