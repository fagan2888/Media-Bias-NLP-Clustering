Complex trusts should consider the Medicare surtax issue as an opportunity to extend a bypass trust to all descendants.

One of the most annoying parts of the latest round of estate tax changes is the 3.8 percent Medicare surtax, enacted as part of the Affordable are Act (or ObamaCare) and taking effect last year. For trusts and estates, the 3.8 percent surtax is imposed on the excess of adjusted gross income over the dollar amount at which the highest trust/estate income tax bracket begins, or undistributed net investment income (NII), whichever is less.

So it’s really hard to avoid paying the tax one way or another. Who might bump up against the Medicare surtax? For 2014, the highest tax bracket is reached when a trust or estate reaches $12,150. Obviously, that’s not a very high number, so the surtax applies to an awful lot of trusts and estates.
