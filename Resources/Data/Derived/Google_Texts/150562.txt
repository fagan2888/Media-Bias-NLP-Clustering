Rumors have swirled that Burr might be considering retirement due to his low fundraising numbers over the past year. These hires suggest he's moving full steam ahead.

"The voters sent a loud and clear message this past November. Our economic and personal freedoms are under attack like never before," Burr said in a statement accompanying the staffing announcements. "That’s why I’m enthusiastically continuing the fight to restore our nation’s prosperity by stopping the unprecedented spending the current administration has proposed, protecting hard working Americans by getting big government off their backs and helping to make our nation safer as we face a new global threat of terrorism."

Paul Shumaker, a longtime Burr adviser who worked on his 2014 race, will serve as general counsel, while top GOP pollster Glen Bolger will conduct Burr's polling. Doug McAuliffe will be Burr's media advisor, Mark Lisella will do communications and Jim McCray and Jonathan Brooks will head up his finance team.

Notably absent from the list is a campaign manager, a sign Burr is still looking someone to run day-to-day activities. Campaigns often hire campaign managers a bit later in the cycle.
