You make an appointment with a doctor. You arrive, show your insurance card, and take a seat in the waiting area. You have your appointment. You leave. You pay nothing. You never receive a bill from an insurance company. You never have to call the doctor\u2019s office or the insurance company \u2014 and wait on hold endlessly \u2014 to straighten out billing or reimbursement paperwork errors. You simply go to your doctor and receive medical care.\n\nNow, also imagine that you pay no monthly premiums at all for health insurance. There are no deductibles. There are no co-pays. You choose your doctor. There are no \u201cout of network\u201d issues to consider. And, best of all, the insurance company won\u2019t deny coverage, refuse to pay, and stick you with the bill.\n\nFor the last three years, I have used a version of \u201csingle payer health care\u201d called MaineCare. Sure, there were a few bumps in the road. Some specialists had very limited hours available for MaineCare patients. A couple receptionists turned visibly cold, downright rude in one case, immediately after learning that I was a MaineCare patient. And, MaineCare did insist that I try less expensive alternatives before agreeing to pay for an absurdly expensive medication \u2014 $1,500 a month! \u2014 to treat my psoriasis.\n\nOther than those minor inconveniences, how I paid for my health care hasn\u2019t been a concern. I haven\u2019t had to worry about finding the money for co-payments. I haven\u2019t had to spend hundreds or thousands of dollars to meet a deductible. My health care was simply paid for with government funds. Those funds come from taxes, including those I have paid for the last 30 years.\n\nAbout six months ago, I received a letter from DHHS informing me that I was being put onto \u201ctransitional MaineCare.\u201d This meant my income would need to be verified more frequently to determine my continued eligibility. I immediately thought about how what was now a paperwork hassle would have been a devastating challenge just a few years ago when things were really tough personally and financially. On Jan. 10, I received a letter indicating my MaineCare coverage would end Jan. 31.\n\nIt\u2019s been scary. I\u2019ll admit I put off going to healthcare.gov to find health insurance because I didn\u2019t want to face the fact that I will now have a dramatic increase in my monthly expenses. Suddenly I have monthly premiums. I will have to pay for doctor visits. I will have to pay for about 60 percent of much of my care until I meet my new plan\u2019s deductible.\n\nIt\u2019s true that the Affordable Care Act has made the costs lower than before. But there is nothing low about going from paying nothing to paying about $200 a month just for insurance. Remember my $1,500-a-month medication? No matter how much the new insurance covers, you can be sure I\u2019ll have to spend up to my new insurance\u2019s $1,500 maximum annual out-of-pocket amount. That\u2019s $200 a month, co-pays, co-insurance until I meet the $500 deductible, and likely up to $1,500 because of the expensive medication. From $0 to $3,900 or more for one year.\n\nThe worry about new expenses could very well impact my overall health. Fear of costs \u2014 even reduced costs at a place like Community Dental (which, full disclosure, is a client of my grant writing business) \u2014 kept me from going to the dentist for over a year. I am sure the same thing will happen, as I know it does for other people, when it comes to easily treated minor health issues. Even $20 here and $10 there add up quickly when my bank balances are terribly low.\n\nThe frightening truth is the costs of paying for health insurance and health care now put me at risk of going back into serious financial crisis. The costs of another crisis would be exponential, negatively impacting my children, my work, my personal life, and my health.\n\nA 7 percent increase in payroll taxes for businesses \u2014 with zero dollars paid to any health insurance company \u2014 and a 2 percent increase in personal income taxes \u2014 with zero premiums, co-pays, or co-insurance \u2014 is a price worth paying for ensuring everyone has access to high-quality healthcare. That\u2019s what the Economic Policy Institute estimates it would take to pay for truly universal health coverage.\n\nAgain, imagine it. You visit your doctor without paying anything and without dealing with insurance companies at all. That is \u201csingle payer\u201d health care.\n\nFor those of you who think a publicly financed universal health care means more bureaucracy, significantly higher taxes, or government control of your health care, I dare you to read the FAQ on the Physicians for a National Health Program website: http://www.pnhp.org/facts/single-payer-faq.\n\nHeather Denkmire is a writer and artist who lives in Portland with her two young daughters.
