Both driver and passenger were ejected, Sutherland said.\n\nThe 20-year-old male driver was pronounced dead at the scene. The female passenger was transported to Swedish Medical Center but died almost nine hours later at 11:54 a.m.\n\nDrugs may have played a role, but Sutherland said that is still under investigation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s suspected there was marijuana involved because the vehicle rolled and there was still marijuana in the car,\u201d he said.\n\nAuthorities have not yet identified the two people.\n\nKirk Mitchell: 303-954-1206, denverpost.com/coldcases or twitter.com/kirkmitchell", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Pot, speed suspected in crash that left 2 dead in Arapahoe County", "title": "Pot, speed suspected in crash that left 2 dead in Arapahoe County", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/08/01/pot-speed-suspected-in-crash-that-left-2-dead-in-arapahoe-county/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-01T08:22:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-01T08:22:17+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2a0d\"", "article_summary": "Excessive speed and possible marijuana use left a driver and his passenger dead during an early Saturday morning rollover crash that ended down an Arapahoe County embankment.\n\u201cIt\u2019s suspected there was marijuana involved because the vehicle rolled and there was still marijuana in the car,\u201d he said.\nThe crash happened around 2:30 a.m. Saturday near Gun Club Road and Hampden Avenue, said Trooper Tim Sutherland of the Colorado State Patrol.\nBoth driver and passenger were ejected, Sutherland said.\nThe female passenger was transported to Swedish Medical Center but died almost nine hours later at 11:54 a.m."}
