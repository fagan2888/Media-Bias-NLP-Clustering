They also come on the heels of some similarly hefty ratings numbers for the series finale of AMC\u2019s \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d on Sept. 29, which drew 10.3 million total viewers and 6.7 million viewers in the demo.\n\nAs such, they suggest an acceleration of the trend we saw last season, in which \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d made history by routinely beating its broadcast competition in the 18-49 demographic.\n\nFor the entire 2012-13 season, \u201cSunday Night Football\u201d still came out ahead for AMC\u2019s gorefest, but this season\u2019s strong start for the zombies makes this network-vs-cable contest worth keeping an eye on.\n\nThe show also generated major activity on social media. \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d topped the Nielsen\u2019s weekly Twitter TV rating, drawing a unique audience of 7.5 million Twitter users to view its 1.17 million Tweets about the show on Sunday night.
