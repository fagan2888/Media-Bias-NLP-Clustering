His mobile \u201coffice\u201d consisted of a foldout table, a laptop and a small sign that read, \u201cWe can help you\u201d in Somali and \u201cObama Care.\u201d\n\nThough much attention has focused on the March 31 deadline to buy private health insurance \u2014 and the consumer frenzy that resulted \u2014 federal health reform and the debut of MNsure have also led to a historic surge in the number of Minnesotans enrolling in public programs.\n\nAll told, nearly 99,000 Minnesotans have signed up for subsidized coverage through Medical Assistance, the state\u2019s version of Medicaid, since MNsure\u2019s launch six months ago. Average monthly enrollment in the program is projected to reach 835,000 this fiscal year, up 13 percent from 2013 \u2014 the largest year-over-year surge in at least 15 years and, percentage-wise, one of the largest in the nation.\n\nAnd the numbers almost certainly will climb higher. While open enrollment has closed for private coverage, eligible Minnesotans can still apply for public programs such as Medical Assistance and MinnesotaCare, and the strenuous push to reach poor and uninsured Minnesotans is still forging ahead. Most of MNsure\u2019s 800 trained helpers, known as \u201cnavigators,\u201d continue to fan out to libraries, shopping malls, barber shops and other locations in a sustained effort to reach the estimated 440,000 Minnesotans who lack insurance.\n\n\u2018We\u2019re still here\u2019\n\n\u201cThere was a perception that we were going to fold up our tents and go home\u201d after April 1, Hassan said. \u201cBut we\u2019re still here.\u201d\n\nThe resulting expansion of public coverage is unprecedented in scope. Supporters of President Obama\u2019s 2010 health law cite it as a victory, noting that it has cut the number of uninsured Minnesotans and arguing that it will improve the health of vulnerable families and children.\n\n\u201cI am celebrating that we have so many people signing up for public programs,\u201d said Human Services Commissioner Lucinda Jesson. \u201cWe made it easier for people to enroll, and now we\u2019re staying on them as long as they are eligible.\u201d\n\nSkeptics warn it could pose a long-term threat to the state\u2019s fiscal health. Although the federal government will pick up more than 90 percent of the cost of expanding Medicaid coverage in the first nine years, state spending on the program is forecast to reach $4.57 billion this year, double the amount spent a decade ago.\n\nMNsure does not track the percentage of new enrollees who previously lacked insurance. But state officials say the surge of enrollments almost certainly is driving down the state\u2019s rate of uninsureds. After rising sharply during the Great Recession, from 7.2 percent in 2007 to 9.1 percent in 2011, Minnesota\u2019s uninsured rate fell to 8.2 percent in 2013.\n\nThat experience is mirrored across much of the country. Researchers at the Urban Institute in Washington, D.C., estimate that the Affordable Care Act (ACA) has reduced the number of uninsured adult Americans by 5.4 million through early March of this year. The nation\u2019s uninsured rate has fallen by 2.7 percentage points, to 15.2 percent, since September 2013, the month before ACA open enrollment began \u2014 the first measurable drop in years.\n\nNavigators such as Hassan played a big role, but so too did looser eligibility requirements contained in the federal law. One key change was the elimination of Medicaid\u2019s so-called \u201casset test.\u201d People can now qualify for public coverage based purely on their incomes, without having to list the value of cars and other possessions.\n\nBut it was the intense publicity surrounding MNsure \u2014 even the negative attention over the frustrating technology glitches \u2014 that likely played the biggest role in the expansion, by raising the profile of insurance among people who qualify but might not have known it. Some 60 percent of Minnesotans who lack health insurance potentially qualify for coverage through a public program, but they are not enrolled because of real or perceived barriers, according to Minnesota Department of Health surveys.\n\n\u201cBy raising the public profile of [health] insurance in general, a lot of people who may have been unaware they could qualify signed up,\u201d said Julie Sonier, deputy director of the University of Minnesota\u2019s State Health Access Data Assistance Center (SHADAC).\n\nHigher coverage, higher costs?\n\nState officials have taken steps to control the rising outlays in Medical Assistance in the last two years, but say they have yet to estimate the long-term impact on the state budget. \u201cIt\u2019s too early to project where we\u2019ll be two years from now,\u201d Jesson said.\n\nSome lawmakers consider the challenge urgent.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at a crossroads,\u201d said Rep. Tara Mack, a Republican from Apple Valley and member of the Legislature\u2019s MNsure oversight committee. \u201cWe\u2019ve expanded access without making critical reforms [to Medicaid]. If we do nothing to address costs, then we\u2019re heading to a pretty steep cliff where the spending is going to bleed other areas of state government.\u201d\n\nFor now, however, many of the new Medical Assistance enrollees are enjoying the benefits of having coverage.\n\nMary Hierlinger, 57, credits MNsure with saving her life. The Anoka resident was recently diagnosed with ovarian cancer, and said she would be unable to pay for $30,000 in medical bills if she had not been approved earlier this year for Medical Assistance. Were it not for that, she said, \u201cI might not be talking to you right now.\u201d\n\nLast week, as he walked past the colorful stalls of East African clothing at the Village Market on E. 24th Street, Hassan could barely take 10 steps without someone stopping to ask him about MNsure.\n\n\u201cThis is my territory,\u201d he said proudly.\n\nHassan stroked his goatee and laughed as people lavished him with thanks for signing them up after years without insurance. Hassan\u2019s employer, Somali Health Solutions, has helped enroll 1,200 people since last fall.\n\n\u201cWithout this man, I would not have insurance,\u201d said Abdiqani Muhamed, 25, embracing Hassan as he spoke. \u201cNow, I don\u2019t have to live in fear of going to the hospital and not being able to pay my bills. It\u2019s a new day for me.\u201d\n\nTwitter: @chrissserres", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "Nearly 99,000 Minnesotans have signed up for subsidized coverage through Medical Assistance, the state's version of Medicaid, since MNsure's launch six months ago.", "title": "Minnesota's uninsured get public aid at historic levels", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/minnesota-s-uninsured-get-public-aid-at-historic-levels/255109871/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_139744215697249.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=top", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_139744215697249.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=top", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "Nearly 99,000 Minnesotans have signed up for subsidized coverage through Medical Assistance, the state's version of Medicaid, since MNsure's launch six months ago.", "title": "Minnesota's uninsured get public aid at historic levels", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/minnesota-s-uninsured-get-public-aid-at-historic-levels/255109871/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_139744215697249.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=top", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_139744215697249.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=top"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Nearly 99,000 Minnesotans have signed up for subsidized coverage through Medical Assistance, the state's version of Medicaid, since MNsure's launch six months ago."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0d09\"", "article_summary": "His mission: To sign up every eligible uninsured person he met for public health coverage through the state\u2019s MNsure website.\n\u201cBut we\u2019re still here.\u201dThe resulting expansion of public coverage is unprecedented in scope.\nWhile open enrollment has closed for private coverage, eligible Minnesotans can still apply for public programs such as Medical Assistance and MinnesotaCare, and the strenuous push to reach poor and uninsured Minnesotans is still forging ahead.\nAll told, nearly 99,000 Minnesotans have signed up for subsidized coverage through Medical Assistance, the state\u2019s version of Medicaid, since MNsure\u2019s launch six months ago.\nOne key change was the elimination of Medicaid\u2019s so-called \u201casset test.\u201d People can now qualify for public coverage based purely on their incomes, without having to list the value of cars and other possessions."}
