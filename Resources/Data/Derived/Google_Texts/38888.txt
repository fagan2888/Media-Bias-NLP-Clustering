Rating Action: Moody's assigns B3 CFR to Affordable Care; rates LBO financing Global Credit Research - 06 Oct 2015 Approximately $365 million of new debt rated New York, October 06, 2015 -- Moody's Investors Service assigned a B3 Corporate Family Rating and B3-PD Probability of Default Rating to Affordable Care Holding Corp. ("ACH"). Moody's also assigned a B2 rating to the company's proposed first lien senior secured credit facilities, including a $40 million revolving credit facility and $325 million term loan. The rating outlook is stable. This is the first time Moody's has publicly rated ACH. The proceeds from the first lien term loan, a $135 million privately-placed senior secured second lien note offering (not rated by Moody's), and contribution of common equity, will fund the acquisition of the company by Berkshire Partners LLC, and pay transaction fees and expenses. As part of the transaction, Berkshire Partners and existing investors, including American Capital and management, will contribute approximately $390 million of common equity. All ratings are subject to review of final documentation. Moody's assigned the following ratings: Affordable Care Holding Corp.: Corporate Family Rating at B3 Probability of Default Rating at B3-PD Senior secured credit facilities at B2 (LGD 3) The rating outlook is stable. RATINGS RATIONALE Affordable Care's B3 Corporate Family Rating reflects the company's small absolute size based on revenue and earnings, very high financial leverage, and modest free cash flow and interest coverage. The rating also reflects the company's minimal service line diversity focused primarily on the provision of dentures, and the economic sensitivity of the business due to the self-pay nature of the company's payor mix. In addition, Moody's expects the company to pursue a growth strategy of opening new centers that will constrain free cash flow over the intermediate term. The ratings are also constrained by the high degree of regulatory oversight within the DSO industry. The company's credit profile benefits from its market position among the largest providers of denture services in the U.S. market (albeit in a highly fragmented industry). The ratings are also supported by the company's good revenue diversity across both affiliates and states, its positive same-store sales growth, and limited reimbursement risk due to a largely upfront cash-pay nature of its patients. On a pro forma basis for the LBO transaction, the company's debt to EBITDA was approaching 8 times on a Moody's adjusted basis for the twelve months ended June 30, 2015. The stable rating outlook incorporates Moody's assumption that the company's growth will be financed predominantly through internally-generated cash. The stable outlook also reflects Moody's expectation of low-to-mid single digit same-store revenue and earnings growth and that the company will reduce financial leverage to below 7 times on a Moody's adjusted basis over the next 12-to-18 months. The ratings could be downgraded if there is any deterioration in the company's operating performance, or if ACH engages in debt-financed M&A activity or shareholder distributions. In particular, the ratings could be downgraded if Moody's comes to believe the company is unlikely to reduce debt to EBITDA below 7 times over the next 12-to-18 months, or if liquidity deteriorates. Over time, the rating could be upgraded if the company can significantly grow its size and diversify sources of revenue across services. An upgrade would also require the company exhibiting solid same-store sales and earnings growth, and sustain adjusted debt to EBITDA below 6 times. The principal methodology used in these ratings was Business and Consumer Service Industry published December 2014. Please see the Credit Policy page on www.moodys.com for a copy of this methodology. Headquartered in Raleigh, North Carolina, Affordable Care Holding Corp. ("ACH"), is a U.S. dental service organization ("DSO") which provides management and dental laboratory services to affiliate dental centers, primarily focused on dentures and implants. ACH is affiliated with approximately 221 dental offices across 39 U.S. states. Net revenues are approximately $135 million. In September 2015, private equity firm Berkshire Partners LLC reached an agreement to acquire Affordable Care from financial sponsor American Capital Ltd.
