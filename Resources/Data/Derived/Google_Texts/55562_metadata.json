Thompson says it was a complicated political issue for county officials and that \u201clike most bureaucracies, they don\u2019t want to have to deal with it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s enough conversations now where people are starting to get PrEP\u2026and the interest is growing very rapidly,\u201d Thompson says. \u201cWe have encouraged [Los Angeles] County to take that first step and fund a PrEP navigation and education program of some type.\u201d\n\nData released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2013 listed Los Angeles within the 20 U.S. cities with the highest HIV infection rates. Last year, the CDC issued new guidelines recommending daily PrEP use among HIV-negative men who have sex with men who are \u201cat substantial risk for HIV.\u201d The Food and Drug Administration approved Truvada , an antiretroviral drug already used to treat existing HIV infections, for PrEP in the summer of 2012.\n\nThompson acknowledged that little was known about PrEP a few years ago but highlighted emerging discussions surrounding the treatment, specifically within Los Angeles County. Last fall APLA launched a PrEP program that educates eligible patients and offers them access to Truvada.\n\nBut Thompson said opponents of PrEP are far more vocal in Los Angeles County than in other regions \u2014 specifically the Los Angeles\u2013based AIDS Healthcare Foundation, which touts itself as the \u201clargest provider of HIV/AIDS medical care in the U.S.\u201d AHF president Michael Weinstein has previously referred to Truvada as a \u201cparty drug,\u201d implying that its use in certain situations could potentially leave gay men susceptible to infection. Other critics argue that it will lead to a rise in promiscuity and unsafe sex among MSM.\n\nLos Angeles County\u2019s public health department stressed that AHF\u2019s critiques don\u2019t deter the county or the department \u201cfrom pursuing sound HIV prevention policy supported by research, science, data, evidence, and the [FDA] and [CDC].\u201d But Thompson said the AIDS Healthcare Foundation has been \u201cpretty persistent in its attempts to slow the process around the county developing a PrEP program.\u201d He called the plateaued efforts \u201cextraordinarily frustrating and bewildering,\u201d noting that the funds to implement a countywide program are already available thanks to the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program and the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThompson praised both New York City and San Francisco for their respective efforts in providing proper PrEP education to gay and bisexual men.\n\nThompson credited San Francisco supervisor Scott Wiener for demystifying PrEP by acknowledging his own use of Truvada in an op-ed for The Huffington Post. And in New York, Governor Andrew Cuomo has included PrEP in his highly regarded plan to reduce new HIV infections in the state by 2020.\n\nLos Angeles County\u2019s public health department says it anticipates supporting a range of activities to increase PrEP awareness, including training community agencies, requiring testing providers to discuss PrEP with their clients, creating a PrEP provider directory, and maintaining a PrEP section on both its Web site and the Division of HIV and STD Programs\u2019 page. Health officials said during their mid-March public meeting that the department hopes to implement PrEP in public health clinics by this summer, with the county likely paying for most PrEP-related costs.\n\nThompson said APLA will continue to target black and Latino gay and bisexual men in low-income areas with its PrEP program.\n\n\u201cPrEP is going to be one of the activities that\u2019s going to take years to roll out\u2014this could be a lifetime intervention,\u201d Thompson says. \u201cWe really need to be taking the initial steps as soon as possible because we\u2019re losing and have lost really valuable time.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bureaucracy and deliberate attempts to block prevention techniques are slowing down Los Angeles\u2019s ability to disseminate PrEP.", "og": {"image": "http://www.advocate.com/sites/advocate.com/files/2015/05/07/How-PrEP-Is-Being-Blocked-By-Bureaucracyx400.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-26T15:36:45-05:00", "type": "article", "title": "How PrEP Is Being Blocked By Bureaucracy"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Advocate", "fb": {"page_id": 19799718480, "app_id": 625763650825412, "pages": 6030918854}, "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-11T04:00:27-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-11T04:00:27-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe14e1\"", "article_summary": "Last fall APLA launched a PrEP program that educates eligible patients and offers them access to Truvada.\nHow PrEP Is Being Blocked By BureaucracyAfter months of petitioning from HIV/AIDS advocates, officials with Los Angeles County\u2019s Division of HIV and STD Programs (DHSP) presented a county-wide implementation plan for PrEP during a mid-March public meeting.\nThompson acknowledged that little was known about PrEP a few years ago but highlighted emerging discussions surrounding the treatment, specifically within Los Angeles County.\nThompson said APLA will continue to target black and Latino gay and bisexual men in low-income areas with its PrEP program.\nLos Angeles County\u2019s public health department says it anticipates supporting a range of activities to increase PrEP awareness, including training community agencies, requiring testing providers to discuss PrEP with their clients, creating a PrEP provider directory, and maintaining a PrEP section on both its Web site and the Division of HIV and STD Programs\u2019 page."}
