Angus King didn\u2019t make any new friends when he visited with Fox & Friends on Tuesday. In a tense exchange over the Affordable Care Act, King took exception to hosts\u2019 description of MIT professor Jonathan Gruber\u2019s comments on the lack of transparency in the bill. Gruber was a key figure in helping to draft the bill.\n\nHere\u2019s a transcript from Mark Finkelstein at Newsbusters:\n\nBRIAN KILMEADE: Senator, you were not in the Senate when they voted on Obamacare. And I wonder would you have voted on then and especially would you vote on now after you hear this. One of the architects, Jonathan Gruber, was caught on camera saying this at the University of Pennsylvania. And I put in brackets, the stupidity of the American voter. Let\u2019s listen.\n\n[Plays Gruber\u2019s comments]\n\n\n\nKILMEADE: So he\u2019s basically saying that he didn\u2019t tell the truth when the law was passed; neither did Democrats when they put it forward. Your reaction to that? Are you as outraged as most of America?\n\n\n\nANGUS KING: Well, he shouldn\u2019t, I don\u2019t know what he was talking about. I certainly don\u2019t endorse those kind of comments. But I can recall that debate. I wasn\u2019t in office, but it was a very vigorous debate. Everybody knew that there were going to be additional taxes required to support the premiums under the Affordable Care Act. I don\u2019t see it as any deep dark conspiracy. There were all kinds of \u2014\n\n\n\nKILMEADE: Really? He said he wasn\u2019t transparent. Senator, he said he wasn\u2019t transparent. He wasn\u2019t telling the truth.\n\n\n\nKING: Who was he? I don\u2019t know where he was in the process. There were hundreds of people \u2013\n\n\n\nKILMEADE: He wrote it!\n\n\n\nKIMBERLY GUILFOYLE: He\u2019s the architect of Obamacare. He\u2019s the one who put it together, one of them, and said in fact that they weren\u2019t transparent and forthcoming with the CBO because if they were, then the American people would know that in fact this was going to be something that was going to tax and penalize them and then they wouldn\u2019t go for it.\n\n\n\nKING: Wait a minute, wait a minute. Tax and penalize, hold it, hold it, hold it. We\u2019ve got eight million people that have insurance now that didn\u2019t before and don\u2019t lecture me about this because 40 years ago, I had insurance. If I hadn\u2019t had it, it caught a cancer that saved my life. If I hadn\u2019t had insurance I\u2019d be dead \u2014\n\n\n\nKILMEADE: What does that have to do with it?\n\n\n\nGUILFOYLE: But that doesn\u2019t have anything to do with it.\n\n\n\nKING: It does. It has to do with having insurance, man. If you don\u2019t have insurance, it\u2019s a high risk.\n\n\n\nKILMEADE: They just lied about a health plan to the American people, called the stupidity of the American voter and bragged about the lack of transparency.\n\n\n\nKING: This is one guy. I don\u2019t know who this guy was. All I know is that it\u2019s important for people to have health insurance. And if you guys are saying people shouldn\u2019t have health insurance, I don\u2019t know where you\u2019re coming from.\n\n\n\nGUILFOYLE: That\u2019s not what we\u2019re saying, sir.\n\n\n\nKING: Are you that cruel? That is what you\u2019re saying.\n\n\n\nGUILFOYLE: No we\u2019re not.\n\n\n\nKILMEADE: Oh my goodness!\n\n\n\nGUILFOYLE: We\u2019re just looking out for the facts and information.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Maine Sen.
