That legislation was passed by the Idaho House on a 37-31 vote in February and cleared by the Senate on a 27-7 vote in March. Republican Gov. Butch Otter signed the measure into law on April 2.\n\nAmong other things, the law affirms parents\u2019 rights to direct the education of their children, view all of their students\u2019 school records, direct a child\u2019s religious training, and make health decisions for offspring.\n\nWhen the bill first surfaced during the 2014 legislative session, ISBA President Karen Echeverria wondered about the need for new language in the code.\n\n\u201cThe Idaho School Boards Association does not understand the need for this,\u201d Echeverria said. \u201cWe don\u2019t see that the U.S. Constitution addresses education, so we don\u2019t think that it makes sense to reference it. We frankly don\u2019t understand why this bill is even necessary at all.\u201d\n\nNow, the ISBA is launching an offensive against further expanding the statute.\n\n\u201cThe Idaho School Boards Association will maintain a log of incidents that school districts are addressing in working with parents who take exception to various districts\u2019 practices, and will work with the education community to communicate to the Idaho Legislature the impact of the exceptions on district personnel and district budgets, and will work with the Idaho Legislature to hold at bay any expansion of the parental rights in regard to education as outlined in House Bill No. 113a,\u201d the resolution outlines.\n\nThe ISBA wording unnerved some parents.\n\n\u201cOur taxpayer money is going to a private trade group that backs the federal government over parents\u2019 rights,\u201d said Middleton\u2019s Tammy Nichols, a mother and education advocate. \u201cAnd we are having to pay for that.\u201d\n\nMila Wood of Middleton also blasted ISBA for pushing the plan and wondered if the Middleton School District should spend thousands of dollars a year to participate in the private lobbying group.\n\n\u201cTo find out this private trade group wants parents to have less of a voice in their child\u2019s education and privacy protection, it makes me sad,\u201d Wood said. \u201cWould parents in Middleton be proud and happy that our district is using taxpayer money, that could go into classrooms, to fund this group working against them?\u201d\n\nEcheverria has not returned a call for comment on the resolution, which was submitted by the Pocatello-Chubbuck School District. Officials in that district did not respond to email requests for comment.\n\nNichols said ISBA\u2019s lobbying against a law supporting parental rights gives credence to the measure\u2019s importance. \u201cTo me and others, it means they are going to do everything in their power to keep a firm hold on the rights of the parents to express themselves,\u201d she said of the ISBA. \u201cThey\u2019ll keep as tight a hold on parents as they can.\u201d\n\nOriginally published in Watchdog.org.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new Idaho School Board Association resolution wants the legislature to \u201chold at bay any expansion of the parental rights in regard to education.\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A new Idaho School Board Association resolution wants the legislature to \u201chold at bay any expansion of the parental rights in regard to education.\u201d", "title": "Idaho Legislature Wants Stronger Protections for Parents.
