* Interesting goings-on down in Cuba:

In an extraordinary news conference Monday afternoon, President Obama and Cuban President Raúl Castro sparred over human rights, Guantánamo and their starkly different views of their own countries and the world, even as both hailed Obama’s historic visit here as a successful new step in normalizing relations. The event was at times a jarring juxtaposition of diplomatic formality and public jousting, as questions from American reporters sparked abrupt reactions from Castro, who either ignored them or dismissed them as misguided, challenging one reporter to “give me names” of alleged political prisoners here. For his part, Obama seemed to relish the opportunity to display his comfort in discussing both the things they agreed on, and those they did not. The public exchange was virtually unprecedented in Cuba.

Meanwhile, somewhere in Miami, Marco Rubio explained to the guy delivering his pizza why this trip was a terrible idea.

* Ladies and gentlemen, your next commander in chief:

Donald Trump outlined an unabashadly noninterventionist approach to world affairs Monday, telling The Washington Post’s editorial board that he questions the need for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which has formed the backbone of Western security policies since the Cold War. The meeting at The Post covered a range of issues, including media libel laws, violence at his rallies, climate change, the NATO and the U.S. presence in Asia. Speaking ahead of a major address on foreign policy later Monday in front of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, Trump said he advocates an aggressive U.S. posture in the world with a light footprint. In spite of unrest abroad, especially in the Middle East, Trump said the United States must look inward and steer its resources toward rebuilding domestic infrastructure.

What’s weird is that occasionally, Trump says something interesting about foreign affairs, for a Republican at least. It’s as though through his spectacular ignorance he actually stumbles upon a sensible idea, like Mr. Magoo.

* Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar reports the latest Obamacare-is-destroying-our-freedom news:

There’s growing evidence that most of the dramatic gain in the number of Americans with health care coverage is due to President Barack Obama’s law, and not the gradual recovery of the nation’s economy. That could pose a political risk for Republicans running against “Obamacare” in the GOP primaries as they shift to the general election later this year. While the health care law remains highly unpopular in the party, the prospect of taking away health care coverage from millions of people could trigger a backlash if the eventual GOP nominee’s plan to replace it is seen as coming up short.

Sure, tens of millions of people will lose their coverage if Republicans get their way. But President Trump will replace it with “something terrific,” so nobody needs to worry.

* Philip Bump has some excellent graphs showing why the GOP can’t win with white voters alone.

* Theodoric Meyer and Elena Schneider report that having Donald Trump as the Republican nominee could give Democrats the opportunity to take back the House, something no one thought was possible before now.

* Simon Rosenberg surveys the electoral landscape and notes that Trump could put some new states like Arizona in play for Democrats at both the presidential and Senate levels.

* Emily Crockett reports that Ted Cruz supporters are trying to slut-shame Trump’s wife to convince Mormon voters in Utah to vote for Cruz. Classy!

* Ryan Cooper envisions a scenario in which Trump starts to use local police forces as his personal goons, and it’s actually not entirely implausible. — gs

* Brian Beutler explains how efforts to blame Obama for Trump’s rise reveal the limits of the introspection that conservatives will permit themselves when it comes to reckoning with the real causes of Trumpism. — gs

* Jamelle Bouie on the extremely tough choice Republicans now face: They may have to field a third party challenger to Trump, sacrificing the White House in hopes of saving their Congressional majorities, and with them, the conservative movement. — gs

* Hillary chief strategist Joel Benenson posts a memo arguing that Clinton’s victory in Ohio provides the template for an economic message that could succeed in the general election.

* Progressive Change Campaign Committee co-founder Adam Green argues that Clinton’s success in the primaries is being driven by her embrace of economic populism, which is shifting the Democratic Party leftward.

* Mark Schmitt argues that even if a liberal Supreme Court rolled back campaign finance decisions like Citizens United, it wouldn’t be enough to seriously reduce the influence of big money, but he suggests some affirmative efforts that might.

* At The Week, I argued that Bernie Sanders’ campaign has been a smashing success, even if he’ll never be president.

* At the American Prospect, I explained how you can predict which Republicans will rally behind Trump and which won’t.

* Sarah Posner reports that Sheldon Adelson is using the newspaper he owns in Israel to sell Trump to the Israeli public.

* Chris Mooney reports that we’re putting more carbon into the atmosphere than the earth has seen in at least 66 million years, which is encouraging.

* And today Obama was pictured in front of a mural of Che Guevara. Steve Benen explains why the resulting conservative explosion of glee — oops, I mean, outrage — was more transparently ridiculous than usual. — gs
