Along the way, he made a cutting observation about the Left\u2019s assault on the American work ethic.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nRowe quotes MSNBC host Melissa Harris-Perry in full:\n\nI want us to be super careful when we use the language \u201chard worker.\u201d I actually keep an image of folks working in cotton fields on my office wall, because it is a reminder about what hard work really looks like. But in the context of relative privilege, when you talk about work-life balance, the moms who don\u2019t have health care aren\u2019t called hard workers. We call them failures. We call them people who are sucking off the system.\n\nWhat makes this outburst especially odd is that Harris-Perry was responding to praise for Speaker of the House Paul Ryan\u2019s work ethic. Ryan is widely praised for his energy, but it would seem like a very long and tortured intellectual journey to connect it with involuntary manual labor.\n\nRowe picked up on Harris-Perry\u2019s talk of \u201crelative privilege,\u201d and pointed out one of the most important distinctions between \u201chard work\u201d and slavery: the former is voluntary.\n\nFirst of all, slavery is not \u201chard work;\u201d it\u2019s forced labor. There\u2019s a big difference. Likewise, slaves are not workers; they are by definition, property. They have no freedom, no hope, and no rights. Yes, they work hard, obviously. But there can be no \u201cwork ethic\u201d among slaves, because the slave has no choice in the matter. Workers on the other hand, have free will. They are free to work as hard as they wish. Or not. The choice is theirs. And their decision to work hard, or not, is not a function of compliance or coercion; it\u2019s a reflection of character and ambition. This business of conflating hard work with forced labor not only minimizes the importance of a decent work ethic, it diminishes the unspeakable horror of slavery. Unfortunately, people do this all the time. We routinely describe bosses as \u201cslave-drivers,\u201d and paychecks as \u201cslave\u2019s wages.\u201d Melissa though, has come at it from the other side. She\u2019s suggesting that because certain \u201chard workers\u201d are not as prosperous as other \u201chard workers,\u201d \u2013 like the people on her office wall \u2013 we should all be \u201csuper-careful\u201d about overly-praising hard work. I suspect this is because Melissa believes \u2013 as do many others \u2013 that success today is mostly a function of what she calls, \u201crelative privilege.\u201d This is fancy talk for the simple fact that life is unfair, and some people are born with more advantages than others. It\u2019s also a fine way to prepare the unsuspecting viewer for the extraordinary suggestion that slavery is proof-positive that hard work doesn\u2019t pay off.\n\nRowe makes some terrific points in the brief space of his blog post, and skirts along the beaches of a very deep, dark ocean of collectivist thought. Many on the Left argue that all work is essentially involuntary. They see the vital mission of socialist government as a crusade to free people from need. Need forces people to work at jobs they find unpleasant or unsatisfying. It forces them to put up with demeaning treatment from those who sign their paychecks.\n\nRemember how Democrats tried to spin the wave of unemployment prompted by ObamaCare as a wonderful example of people being \u201cfreed\u201d from \u201cjob lock?\u201d Remember how House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi celebrated ObamaCare because it would set people free to pursue lives as poorly-compensated artists and poets, without having to worry about paying for health care?\n\nAs a centuries-old strain of collectivist thought puts it, the necessity of working for sustenance forces the Little People to be inauthentic. They are enslaved by their need for food and shelter, forced to hide their true identity and honest thoughts for the sake of earning a paycheck, and getting along with the arrogant jerks who sign it.\n\nUnsurprisingly, this line of thinking is an easy sell to young people, and immature people who are no longer young.\n\nAnother common strain of Leftist thought involves changing the definition of \u201cwork.\u201d It is very common to hear the labor of upper-income people dismissed as cream-puff activity, compensated at outrageously high rates, even though it\u2019s nowhere near as difficult as the labors of the working poor. Phrases such as \u201cworking families\u201d were coined to separate lower- and middle-income people from the high wage earners they\u2019re supposed to despise, so they\u2019ll withhold any moral objection to seizing the \u201cunfair\u201d wealth of those tax revenue targets. Even high-income people who work insanely long hours are treated as overpaid under this philosophy.\n\nNotice how Harris-Perry cites \u201cmoms who don\u2019t have health care\u201d as her example of true, but unsung, \u201chard workers.\u201d This appropriates the language of productive labor for other political ends. Lacking health care may be lamentable, but it has nothing to do with working hard. (Also, why are moms lacking health care, after President Obama nationalized health insurance?)\n\nThe Left has been pushing the notion that no one should have to work hard for a long time. It wants the acclaim and respect for hard work bestowed on their preferred constituencies, but in the end they think work should be optional. Encouraged, perhaps \u2013 but the socialist welfare state is explicitly premised on the notion that it\u2019s cruel to force people to work for their basic necessities of food and shelter.
