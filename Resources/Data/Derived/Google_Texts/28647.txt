Following a year of falling profits, employee discontent, and the biggest layoff in company history, Orlando Health is reviewing partnership proposals from other health systems, the Orlando Sentinel reports.

Orlando Health spokeswoman Kena Lewis told the Sentinel that although the group is not for sale, it will continue to explore any partnerships that will allow for high quality health care services to be more efficiently delivered to its patients.

In December, Orlando Health announced a partnership with University of Florida, to create UF Cancer Center at Orlando Health. UF replaced MD Anderson.

The effect a partnership or merger will have on the companyâ€™s 15,000 employees or patients is unclear.

Along with its flagship Orlando Regional Medical Center, Orlando Health -- the fifth-largest nonprofit hospital system in the country -- operates seven additional hospitals throughout Central Florida.
