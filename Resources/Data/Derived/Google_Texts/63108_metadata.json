While only 569 UK-trained nurses registered an interest in working in the USA last year, Professor Cumming said there was a risk that the advent of Obamacare earlier this year would lead to US health firms \u201ccoming shopping\u201d in the UK.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re offered a three-year fixed term contract on a similar salary with the opportunity to do an MA and accommodation provided \u2013 and you get to live in New York, San Francisco or Hawaii, or anywhere else you like \u2013 if you\u2019re in your 20s and a newly qualified nurse then you might be interested,\u201d he said.\n\nLosing too many nurses could represent \u201can extraordinary waste of money\u201d, he added, given that it costs between \u00a330,000 and \u00a340,000 to train a nurse in the UK.\n\nHe said it was crucial the NHS valued and supported existing nursing staff. Morale is at an all-time low amid nursing staff in the NHS, as a result increasing work pressures and salary increases well behind inflation. A recent survey revealed that more than half had considered quitting their job and large numbers had looked into the possibility of working in Australia or Dubai, where salaries are often significantly higher.\n\nSalaries also tend to be higher in the USA. Dr Peter Carter, chief executive and general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing said: \u201cNurses who have gone to the US have felt valued and well remunerated, and if the NHS wants to keep them it needs to foster the same feelings.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama\u2019s health reforms could result in thousands of nurses leaving the NHS to work across the Atlantic, a senior health official has warned.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "The Independent", "description": "President Obama\u2019s health reforms could result in thousands of nurses leaving the NHS to work across the Atlantic, a senior health official has warned.", "title": "Obamacare could see NHS nurses poached to work in the US", "url": "http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/obamacare-reforms-could-see-thousands-of-nhs-nurses-poached-to-work-in-the-us-9398930.html", "image": "http://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2014/05/19/17/NHSNurses-Getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-05-20T07:58:06+01:00", "locale": "en_GB", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/obamacare-reforms-could-see-thousands-of-nhs-nurses-poached-to-work-in-the-us-9398930.html", "site": "@independent", "description": "President Obama\u2019s health reforms could result in thousands of nurses leaving the NHS to work across the Atlantic, a senior health official has warned.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Obamacare reforms could see thousands of NHS nurses poached to work in the US"}, "drupal_parsely_version": "0.1", "fb": {"admins": 729735830, "app_id": 235586169789578}, "keywords": ", Health News, Health & Families, Lifestyle", "article": {"video_count": 0, "published_time": "2014-05-19T17:29:55+01:00", "section": "Health News", "embed_count": 0, "author_name": "Charlie Cooper", "word_count": 381, "content_type": "story", "internal_link_count": 0, "image_count": 1, "subsection": "Frontpage", "modified_time": "2014-05-20T07:58:06+01:00", "external_link_count": 0}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd24d\"", "article_summary": "President Obama\u2019s health reforms could result in thousands of nurses leaving the NHS to work across the Atlantic, a senior health official has warned.\nMorale is at an all-time low amid nursing staff in the NHS, as a result increasing work pressures and salary increases well behind inflation.\nThe Obamacare reforms, which have given millions more people access to health insurance, have forced US hospitals to significantly expand their staffing rosters.\nHe said it was crucial the NHS valued and supported existing nursing staff.\nThe USA is looking to fill a shortfall of some 100,000 nurses and could \u201ccome shopping\u201d in the UK, said Professor Ian Cumming, who leads the NHS body responsible for the training and education of health professionals."}
