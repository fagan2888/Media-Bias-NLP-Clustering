In the cruel economics of the pharmaceutical industry, unless the drugs promise a significant return on investment, they are unwilling to invest in it essentially condemning most of the developing world.\u201d\n\nThe Ebola crisis has also made apparent the impact of drastic health budget cuts. Bloomberg News reports that there\u2019s been a nearly one-fifth reduction in public health employees at the state and local levels in just the last six years, with 60,000 fewer people employed than in 2008. This manifests itself in many ways.\n\n\u201cThere are fewer people to deploy to take care of education, training, public service messages, and other information,\u201d Johns Hopkins Professor Albert Wu tells Bloomberg. \u201cEbola is not the first and is not the last challenge to our public health system.\u201d\n\nDr. Tsou says that the lack of sufficient resources is not confined to the United States.\n\n\u201cThe World Health Organization is a shadow of what it should be and is unable to mount a \u2018boots on the ground surveillance, mitigation and quarantine program,\u201d he says. \u201cThe United Nations has called for the world to donate $1 billion to confront the Ebola crisis, but we only have $100,000 in the bank so far.\u201d\n\nNational Nurses United Executive Director RoseAnn DeMoro has commended the recent appointment of an Ebola czar, but has asked the Obama Administration to go further.\n\n\u201cWhat we need is a real czar to assure public safety, not a communicator, and the power to cut the hospitals\u2019 Medicare and Medicaid funding if they still refuse to adhere to those standards and leave their patients, nurses and other caregivers at extreme risk,\u201d she states in a press release.\n\nFor Dr. Tsou, one key public policy measure is necessary to combat such public health emergencies.\n\n\u201cAll residents, including immigrants regardless of legal or financial status, should be able to access the health care system to be diagnosed and treated,\u201d he says. \u201cOur health care system already excludes over 42 million who are uninsured and erroneously denies insurance to millions of immigrants, many who are the most likely to bring Ebola into the country. A single payer system, open to all, offers the best mechanism to ensure early detection of illnesses.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"apple-touch-fullscreen": "YES", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes", "fb": {"pages": 200548226627766}, "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "HandheldFriendly": "true"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb60c\"", "article_summary": "Dr. Walter Tsou, past president of the American Public Health Association and the former health commissioner for Philadelphia, says that the Ebola crisis shows the skewed priorities of the U.S. health care system.\nThe Ebola crisis has revealed severe deficiencies in how the American health care system works, experts say.\n\u201cAll residents, including immigrants regardless of legal or financial status, should be able to access the health care system to be diagnosed and treated,\u201d he says.\nFor Dr. Tsou, one key public policy measure is necessary to combat such public health emergencies.\n\u201cOur health care system already excludes over 42 million who are uninsured and erroneously denies insurance to millions of immigrants, many who are the most likely to bring Ebola into the country."}
