WHO\u2019s most recent findings revealed that one person dies from suicide every 40 seconds. Although suicide has been found to affect every country and every age group, the rates seem to be significantly higher for individuals who live in low- to middle-income countries, as well as those over the age of 70.\n\nOn average, each year 800,000 people pass away from suicide, a death, which, according to WHO, is completely preventable with the correct measures. \u201cThis report is a call for action to address a large public health problem, which has been shrouded in taboo for far too long,\u201d WHO Director-General Dr. Margaret Chan explained in the news release.\n\nAt the head of the suicide list are countries in Asia and Eastern Europe, with India and Lithuania taking the top spots. The report revealed that one of every three suicides worldwide occurs in India, and in Lithuania suicide accounts for the cause of death in an alarming 28.6 deaths per 100,000 people. Other countries in the top spots include: South Korea, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Russia.\n\nMany associate suicides with younger individuals, but this report reveals an unspoken truth: Although many will attempt suicide, older adults are more likely to die from it. The reason for this is simple, young bodies are more resilient than older bodies, Dr. Yeates Conwell, a psychiatrist at the University of Rochester Medical Center, who has studied late-late suicide, told The New York Times. Also, young people are less likely to use lethal methods in their suicide attempts, such as drug overdose or cutting wrists. Firearms are the preferred methods of seniors and, unfortunately, leave little room for error.\n\nIf suicide deaths are so much more common among the elderly, why is the act still associated with youth? Once again, there may be a simple reason for this. Patrick Arbore, founder and director of the Center for Elderly Suicide Prevention in San Francisco suggested to The Times that because of the stigma that still surrounds suicide, \u201ccoroners will go to great lengths to call it something else.\u201d For example, \u201cIf it\u2019s an overdose, they can call it an accident,\u201d Arbore explained.\n\nIt\u2019s unshrouding this stigma that will help to reduce the devastatingly high number of suicides. The WHO also suggested removing much of the \u201csensational\u201d language that the media often uses to describe reports of suicides. For example, many expressed their concern that the wide coverage of the late actor Robin Williams\u2019 suicide and depiction of his death as an \u201coption\u201d may have opened the door to more suicide attempts, The Guardian reported.\n\nOther ways to help reduce suicide is to make it harder for individuals to access the means to kill themselves. Hanging is globally the most common means of committing suicide, but in America, more than half of all suicides are carried out with the use of firearms. Limiting access to tools such as hanging rope, firearms, and poison may help to bring down global suicide rates.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "who, suicide, someone, dies, suicide, every, 40, seconds, rates, highest, among, seniors, and", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The World Health Organization's most recent report on global suicide reveals a person dies from it every 40 seconds, and those over 70 are at highest risk.", "title": "Suicide Deaths Are Highest Among Seniors, So Why Is The Act Still Associated With Youth?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/who-suicide-someone-dies-suicide-every-40-seconds-rates-highest-among-seniors-and-301196", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/04/senior.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The World Health Organization's most recent report on global suicide reveals a person dies from it every 40 seconds, and those over 70 are at highest risk.", "title": "Suicide Deaths Are Highest Among Seniors, So Why Is The Act Still Associated With Youth?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/who-suicide-someone-dies-suicide-every-40-seconds-rates-highest-among-seniors-and-301196", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/04/senior.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/04/senior.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Conditions", "published_time": "2014-09-04T11:48:33-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-04T11:48:32-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The World Health Organization's most recent report on global suicide reveals a person dies from it every 40 seconds, and those over 70 are at highest risk."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9681\"", "article_summary": "WHO\u2019s most recent findings revealed that one person dies from suicide every 40 seconds.\nLimiting access to tools such as hanging rope, firearms, and poison may help to bring down global suicide rates.\nOther ways to help reduce suicide is to make it harder for individuals to access the means to kill themselves.\nOn average, each year 800,000 people pass away from suicide, a death, which, according to WHO, is completely preventable with the correct measures.\nAccording to a recent report released by the World Health Organization, you\u2019ve most likely experienced the death of a loved one to suicide."}
