That was against Thomson Reuters consensus estimates of $0.97 in EPS on $4.25 billion in revenue. In the same period of the previous year, the medical device maker reported $0.91 in EPS on $4.16 billion in revenue.\n\nThe company gave guidance for the remainder of its 2015 fiscal year. This outlook includes both the Medtronic and Covidien businesses, as the merger closed recently. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, the company expects constant currency revenue growth in the range of 4% to 6% on a combined pro forma basis. The consensus estimates for revenue are $7.09 billion for the fourth quarter.\n\nRevenues from the U.S. region totaled $2.46 billion and international revenue was $1.86 billion. In terms of its segments Medtronic reported:\n\nCardiac and Vascular had worldwide sales of $2.22 billion, up 10% on a constant currency basis, or 5% as reported.\n\nRestorative Therapies had worldwide sales of $1.65 billion, up 5% on a constant currency basis, or 2% as reported.\n\nDiabetes had revenue of $449 million, up 6% on a constant currency basis, or 3% as reported.\n\nALSO READ: 5 Top Credit Suisse Health Care Stock Picks to Buy for 2015\n\nOmar Ishrak, chairman and CEO of Medtronic, said:\n\nQ3 was a strong quarter, with revenue growth well above our outlook range for the fiscal year and exceeding our mid-single digit baseline goal. All three legacy Medtronic groups contributed to our robust performance. Our teams are executing on meaningful product launches around the world, and our customers are responding to our differentiated healthcare solutions that seek to demonstrate both clinical and economic value.\n\nThe price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio at Medtronic is 26.08, which is less than its industry average.

The company noted in the report that the merger did not affect the operational results of the company\u2019s fiscal third quarter.\n\nMany investors believe that the Covidien merger in 2014 has been the driver for Medtronic\u2019s recent outperformance, and they will be watching to see if that continues to be the case.
