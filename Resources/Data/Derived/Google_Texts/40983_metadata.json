Generous subsidies, for one, may have to be scaled back despite the potential risk of social unrest in the North African country.\n\nOil revenues make up 97 percent of the country\u2019s hard currency earnings and 60 percent of the government\u2019s budget. Like Russia, which has seen a full-scale run on its currency, there have been few efforts to diversify the economy away from oil and gas.\n\nCentral Bank governor Mohammed Laksaci has warned that the oil and gas dividend won\u2019t last forever though nearly $200 billion of foreign reserves can help cushion the blow in the short-term.\n\n\u201cThis capacity to resist such shocks will disappear quickly if the price of oil stays at a low level for a long time,\u201d he told parliament recently, deploring the economy\u2019s continued dependence on oil.\n\nIn many ways, the rule of Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika has echoes with that of his counterpart in Russia, Vladimir Putin. Both have seen their long tenures buttressed by oil-driven economic growth.\n\nThere has been little impetus for reform at the highest levels with much of policymaking on hold due to the president\u2019s fragile health. Since suffering from a stroke in 2013, Bouteflika has rarely appeared in public.\n\n\u201cThis is the system that he built, as long as he is in power he\u2019s going to keep it that way,\u201d said Geoff Porter, a North Africa analyst. \u201cThe risks that come with market reform and privatization are too daunting for Algeria right now.\u201d\n\nAccording to the International Monetary Fund\u2019s latest report on Algeria, growth for 2014 is estimated to be a decent 4 percent. However, it cautioned that with declining oil production and lower prices, Algeria\u2019s imports will exceed its exports this year for the first time in 15 years.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Falling oil prices worry Algeria", "title": "Falling oil prices worry Algeria", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Falling oil prices worry Algeria", "title": "Falling oil prices worry Algeria", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/12/20/falling_oil_prices_worry_algeria/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/algeria-oil-challenges.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Falling oil prices worry Algeria", "title": "Falling oil prices worry Algeria", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/algeria-oil-challenges.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Karim Kebir and Paul Schemm", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc7fe\"", "article_summary": "Topics: From the Wires, NewsALGIERS, Algeria (AP) \u2014 With oil prices at their lowest in five years and showing few signs of hitting bottom, Algeria is feeling the pinch.\nHowever, it cautioned that with declining oil production and lower prices, Algeria\u2019s imports will exceed its exports this year for the first time in 15 years.\nOil revenues make up 97 percent of the country\u2019s hard currency earnings and 60 percent of the government\u2019s budget.\nLike Russia, which has seen a full-scale run on its currency, there have been few efforts to diversify the economy away from oil and gas.\nThough its problems are dwarfed by the impact on Russia for example, Algeria may have to rein back many of the policies it has held dear over many years."}
