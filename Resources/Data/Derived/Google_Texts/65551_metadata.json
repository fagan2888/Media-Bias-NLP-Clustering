This is one of the numbers that affects the size of your PIA. Essentially, Social Security adjusts your earnings over your career so that you don't lose the value of long-ago lower pay when the dollar was worth much more.\n\nBend Points. Trying to understand these won't give you \"the bends\" that deep-sea divers sometimes get, though the process may seem as painful. The PIA is, in fact, the sum of percentages of three separate portions of your AIME. The portions are called bend points.\n\nIn 2015 you, as a retiree, will get 90 percent of the first $826 of your AIME, plus 32 percent of any AIME dollars between $826 and $4,980, plus 15 percent of AIME amounts above $4,980. The effect of these calculations is that a Social Security benefit \"replaces\" relatively more of the income of lower earners and relatively less of the income of the better off.\n\nSee also: Why is my Social Security check smaller than someone who earned a similar wage?\n\nFRA, Full Retirement Age. Your full retirement age depends on the year of your birth. For instance, 66 is your FRA if you were born between 1943 and 1954. If you begin collecting your benefits at full retirement age, the amount you will receive will be equal to your PIA.\n\nDRC, Delayed Retirement Credit. If you hold off on taking benefits at your full retirement age, you'll earn DRCs at the rate of 8 percent a year, or a 32 percent bonus for the four years between ages 66 and 70. When you finally take benefits, you'll get your PIA plus the markup resulting from the credits you've accumulated. Your PIA is also the benchmark for calculations if you opt for \"early\" benefits, which you can do starting at 62. Your payment will be marked down from your PIA by as much as 25 percent.\n\nSorry, but it's hard to discuss details like these without using the jargon.", "article_metadata": {"page_title": "Social Security: Making Sense of Alphabet Soup", "estimated_publish_date": "2016-01-29", "Last-Modified": "2015-06-17T11:01:53.953-04:00", "keywords": "social security, fra, pia, social security administration, fica, qc, medicare, benefit, gpo, wep", "houseAds": "commercial", "paywallStatus": "off", "isArticle": "true", "author": "Stan Hinden", "comments": "on", "source": "aarp_org", "type": "info", "description": "Social Security terms such as FRA, PIA, FICA and QC can be confusing when retirement planning.
