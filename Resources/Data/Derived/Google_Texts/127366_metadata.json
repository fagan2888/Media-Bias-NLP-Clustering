Those who were uninsured face fines, unless they qualify for one of about 30 exemptions, most of which involve financial hardships.\n\nDayna Dayson of Phoenix estimates that she\u2019ll have to pay the taxman $290 when she files her federal return. Dayson, who\u2019s in her early 30s, works in marketing and doesn\u2019t have a lot left over each month after housing, transportation and other fixed costs. She\u2019d like health insurance but she couldn\u2019t afford it in 2014, as required by the law.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s touted as this amazing thing, but right now, for me, it doesn\u2019t fit into my budget,\u201d she said.\n\nRyan Moon of Des Moines, Iowa, graduated from college in 2013 with a bachelor\u2019s in political science, and is still hunting for a permanent job with benefits. He expects to pay a fine of $95. A supporter of the health care law, he feels conflicted about its insurance mandate and fines.\n\n\u201cI hate the idea that you have to pay a penalty, but at the same time, it helps other people,\u201d said Moon, who\u2019s in his early 20s. \u201cIt really helps society, but society has to be forced to help society.\u201d\n\nGoing without health insurance has always involved financial risks. You could have an accident and end up with thousands of dollars in medical bills. Now, you may also get fined. In a decision that allowed Obama\u2019s law to advance, the Supreme Court ruled in 2012 that the coverage requirement and its accompanying fines were a constitutionally valid exercise of Congress\u2019 authority to tax.\n\nIn 2015, all taxpayers have to report to the IRS on their health insurance status the previous year. Most will check a box. It\u2019s also when the IRS starts collecting fines from some uninsured people, and deciding if others qualify for exemptions.\n\nWhat many people don\u2019t realize is that the penalties go up significantly in 2015. Only 3 percent of uninsured people know what the fine for 2015 will be, according to a recent poll by the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nFiguring out your potential exposure if you\u2019re uninsured isn\u2019t simple.\n\nFor 2014, the fine is the greater of $95 per person or 1 percent of household income above the threshold for filing taxes. It will jump in 2015 to the greater of 2 percent of income or $325. By 2016, the average fine will be about $1,100, based on government figures.\n\nPeople can get a sense of the potential hit by going online and using the Tax Policy Center\u2019s Affordable Care Act penalty calculator.\n\nMany taxpayers may be able to get a pass. Based on congressional analysis, tax preparation giant H&R Block says roughly 4 million uninsured people will pay penalties and 26 million will qualify for exemptions from the list of more than 30 waivers.\n\nBut it\u2019s unclear whether taxpayers are aware of the exemptions.\n\nDeciding what kind of waiver to seek could be crucial. Some can be claimed directly on a tax return, but others involve mailing paperwork to the Department of Health and Human Services. Tax preparation companies say the IRS has told them it\u2019s taking steps to make sure taxpayers\u2019 returns don\u2019t languish in bureaucratic limbo while HHS rules on their waivers.\n\nTurboTax has created a free online tool called \u201cExemption Check\u201d for people to see if they may qualify for a waiver. Charges apply later if the taxpayer files through TurboTax.\n\nTiming will be critical for uninsured people who want to avoid the rising penalties for 2015.\n\nThat\u2019s because Feb. 15 is the last day of open enrollment under the health law. After that, only people with special circumstances can sign up. But just 5 percent of uninsured people know the correct deadline, according to the Kaiser poll.\n\n\u201cWe could be looking at a real train wreck after Feb. 15,\u201d said Stan Dorn, a health policy expert at the nonpartisan Urban Institute. \u201cPeople will file their tax returns and learn they are subject to a much larger penalty for 2015, and they can do absolutely nothing to avoid that.\u201d\n\nThe insurance requirement and penalties remain the most unpopular part of the health care law. They were intended to serve a broader purpose by nudging healthy people into the insurance pool, helping to keep premiums more affordable.\n\nSensitive to political backlash, supporters of the health care law have played down the penalties in their sign-up campaigns. But stressing the positive \u2014 such as the availability of financial help and the fact that insurers can no longer turn away people with health problems \u2014 may be contributing to the information gap about the penalties.\n\nDayson, the Phoenix resident, says she\u2019s hoping her employer will offer a health plan she can fit into her budget, allowing her to avoid higher fines for 2015.\n\nIn Des Moines, recent college graduate Moon has held a succession of temporary local and state government jobs that don\u2019t provide affordable coverage. The penalties are on his mind.\n\n\u201cWhen it gets up to $325, I hope I have a career that actually offers me a good health care plan,\u201d he said.\n\nAssociated Press Social Media Editor Eric Carvin contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Being uninsured in America will cost you more in 2015.", "pubdate": 20141229, "og": {"site_name": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Being uninsured in America will cost you more in 2015.", "title": "Uninsured Americans face potential higher costs in 2015", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/182585871.jpg", "url": "http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/uninsured-u-s-will-cost-2015/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Being uninsured in America will cost you more in 2015.", "title": "Uninsured Americans face potential higher costs in 2015", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/182585871.jpg", "creator": "@newshour", "site": "@newshour", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"app_id": 114150878604116}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newshour", "tag": "taxes"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Affordable Care Act, health care, irs, taxes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2bb8\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIt really helps society, but society has to be forced to help society.\u201dGoing without health insurance has always involved financial risks.\n\u201cWhen it gets up to $325, I hope I have a career that actually offers me a good health care plan,\u201d he said.\nSensitive to political backlash, supporters of the health care law have played down the penalties in their sign-up campaigns.\nA supporter of the health care law, he feels conflicted about its insurance mandate and fines.\nIn 2015, all taxpayers have to report to the IRS on their health insurance status the previous year."}
