Malcolm Gladwell, for instance, is the king of pithily titled, sociologically inflected narrative nonfiction with a vaguely entrepreneurial self-help feel; his \u201cOutliers\u201d has spent 208 weeks on the paperback nonfiction list and is currently No. 7 on the monthly business list. So it seems almost cheeky that the Wharton School professor Adam Grant has settled, for his latest addition to the field, on the pithy title \u201cOriginals.\u201d Grant\u2019s book, which debuts at No. 2 on the hardcover nonfiction list \u2014 and comes with a front-cover endorsement from Gladwell \u2014 overlaps with \u201cOutliers\u201d in substance as well as style: Both propose to explain why some people rise above their peers to change the world. (Gladwell emphasizes practice; Grant, passion and nonconformity.) Readers of the Book Review may be particularly interested in one study Grant cites, in which a psychologist gave subjects an actual New York Times book review, modified to make it either extremely positive or extremely negative, then asked them to rate the critic\u2019s intelligence. \u201cWhich version makes the reviewer sound smarter?\u201d Grant asks. \u201cPeople rated the critical reviewer as 14 percent more intelligent, and having 16 percent greater literary expertise, than the complimentary reviewer. People think an amateur can appreciate art, but it takes a professional to critique it.\u201d Or, as the original researcher put it, \u201cProphets of doom and gloom appear wise and insightful, while positive statements are seen as having a na\u00efve \u2018Pollyanna\u2019 quality.\u201d\n\nColor Theory: A year ago, the monthly games and activities list was dominated by books about the world-building computer game Minecraft. Now the same list is composed entirely of adult coloring books, from the top-ranked \u201cHarry Potter Coloring Book\u201d \u2014 which is, according to the publisher, \u201cfor all ages\u201d \u2014 to \u201cColor Me Calm\u201d at No. 10. What accounts for the sudden faddish interest in coloring inside the lines? And since when has coloring been an adult activity? (For that matter, am I the only one who thinks a truly \u201cadult\u201d coloring book should feature a little nudity? Though preferably \u2014 please, God \u2014 not involving Harry Potter.) In New York magazine last month, the science writer Jordan Gaines Lewis, who is finishing her doctorate in neuroscience, grappled with some of those questions as she explained why she likes the books. \u201cWhat is the psychological draw of a task that feels creative,\u201d she asked, \u201cbut doesn\u2019t actually involve creating anything new?\u201d Coloring, she wrote, lets us incorporate \u201ca little bit of creativity\u201d in our lives while giving us control over simple decisions and reminding us that productivity can be overrated. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot like play, in other words,\u201d she added, \u201csomething that most of us could use more of.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "feature", "ptime": 20160212123923, "twitter": {"description": "Adam Grant\u2019s
