Tonight's special post-election WTF episode of The Independents (Fox Business Network, 9 p.m. ET, 6 p.m. PT, with re-airs three and five hours later) features a canâ€™t-miss interview with libertarian fave Ron Paul, who has some, ah, interesting things to say about those dang Senate Republicans, war, and whether a real libertarian could ever win the presidency. You can watch a snippet of his answer at this link.

Also on the show talking about more or less the same subject (including Sen. Rand Paul by name), is once-and-maybe-future Libertarian Party presidential nominee Gary Johnson. Dan Stein of the restrictionist Federation for American Immigration Reform will talk about hopes and fears for the new GOP Senate majority. Party Panelists Andrea Tantaros (co-host of the Fox News shows Outnumbered and The Five) and Alan Colmes (Alan Colmes!) will bat each other about the face and neck over the meaning of Tuesday's election and the prognosis for the country going forward. And the co-hosts will assess how the new political reality will affect drug de-prohibition and surveillance reform. It's a lively and informative television program.
