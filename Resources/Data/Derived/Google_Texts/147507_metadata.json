Ted Cruz, who appears to be a day away from a major primary victory in Wisconsin, joined Donald Trump in predicting dire consequences for the Republican Party if one of the leaders in the race is denied the nomination at a contested convention.\n\nTrump, who is currently well ahead of Cruz in the delegate count, has previously said that there would be \u201criots\u201d if he won the largest number of delegates but was denied the nomination. Cruz, speaking to reporters on Monday, didn\u2019t go quite that far, but said there would be a \u201crevolt\u201d at the convention if neither he nor Trump gets the nod.\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s Fiscal Fantasy Eliminates $20 Trillion of National Debt in 8 Years\n\n\u201cThis fevered pipe dream of Washington, that at the convention they will parachute in some white knight who will save the Washington establishment\u2026it ain\u2019t gonna happen,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it did, the people would quite rightly revolt.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cIf over 80 percent of the delegates are Cruz delegates and Trump delegates, under what universe do 1,000 Trump delegates or 1,000 Cruz delegates go vote for some uber-Washington lobbyist who hasn\u2019t been on the ballot?\u201d\n\nCruz made it clear that he isn\u2019t talking about the sort of angry protest that Trump surrogate Roger Stone suggested when he called for a Days of Rage-type event outside the convention hall in Cleveland in July. He said the revolt would likely take the form of staying home on Election Day rather than showing up to support a nominee who fared poorly, or didn\u2019t even compete, in the primary elections.\n\nCruz also called for the Republican Party to retain a rule adopted by delegates to the 2012 convention when drafting operating rules for the 2016 gathering. Rule 40(b) requires a candidate to have won at least 50 percent of the delegates in eight separate states in order to have his or her name placed in nomination.\n\nRelated: GOP Accused of \u2018Stealing Delegates\u2019 to Dump Trump\n\nIf the rule is retained, it would most likely bar Ohio Gov. John Kasich from being considered at the convention because he has not met that threshold. Neither has Cruz at this point in the race, but he is expected to do so before the end of the primary season in June.\n\nKasich has no way to win the required 1,237 through the primaries, so he\u2019s counting on being nominated at a contested convention.\n\nBoth Trump and Cruz have become increasingly vocal in their calls for the Ohio governor to get out of the race, with Trump suggesting that that he is taking votes from him.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Texas Sen.", "title": "\u2018Revolts,\u2019 \u2018Riots\u2019 and \u2018Rage\u2019 on Tap if Trump or Cruz Is Denied Nomination", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/04/04/Revolts-Riots-and-Rage-Tap-if-Trump-or-Cruz-Denied-Nomination", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/trump_cruz.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/04/04/Revolts-Riots-and-Rage-Tap-if-Trump-or-Cruz-Denied-Nomination", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/trump_cruz.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Texas Sen.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Trump, who is currently well ahead of Cruz in the delegate count, has previously said that there would be \u201criots\u201d if he won the largest number of delegates but was denied the nomination.\nBoth Trump and Cruz have become increasingly vocal in their calls for the Ohio governor to get out of the race, with Trump suggesting that that he is taking votes from him.\nCruz, speaking to reporters on Monday, didn\u2019t go quite that far, but said there would be a \u201crevolt\u201d at the convention if neither he nor Trump gets the nod.\nRelated: GOP Accused of \u2018Stealing Delegates\u2019 to Dump TrumpIf the rule is retained, it would most likely bar Ohio Gov.\nCruz also called for the Republican Party to retain a rule adopted by delegates to the 2012 convention when drafting operating rules for the 2016 gathering."}
