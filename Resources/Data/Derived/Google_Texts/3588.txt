Two vehicles collided head-on shortly before 12:00 midnight New Year's Eve south of Haysville. Two people were seriously injured, and police wonder if alcohol was involved.

The crash closed South Broadway between 71st and 79th Streets for about an hour. One driver was pinned in his car, while the other was trapped upside-down for about an hour.

Lt. Jason Gill with the Sedgwick County Sheriff's Office says a driver noticed a white Jeep driving erratically, while heading north from the area of Kansas Star Casino. That driver was still on the phone with 911 when the crash occurred.

The Jeep wound up upside-down. The other driver was only about two blocks from his home, and wound up in the median.

"Two people are very, very lucky to be alive tonight," Gill told reporters. "This is a highway [U.S. 81]. Two vehicles moving 50-55 miles an hour towards each other can obviously have very, very bad repercussions."

It's not yet clear if charges will be filed for the crash.
