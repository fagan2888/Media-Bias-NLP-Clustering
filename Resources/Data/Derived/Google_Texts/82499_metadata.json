(Richard Harbus/for New York daily news)\n\nThe newfangled terminal will be nearly twice as large and boast far more restaurants and retail shops than the old space. Passengers are going to \u201chave an experience like they have in a 21st-century airport anyplace around the country or around the world,\u201d Port Authority Executive Director Patrick Foye said.\n\nFoye was less effusive on the subject of the airport workers.\n\nHe suggested the benefits package is delayed in part because of Obamacare. Asked to elaborate during a press conference, Foye dodged the question.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of great importance to the Port Authority and the board, and we will keep you posted on that going forward,\u201d he said.\n\nThe delays have infuriated the long-suffering contract workers.\n\nDozens of them, joined by Sen. Chuck Schumer, rallied Thursday outside the board meeting at 4 World Trade Center.\n\n\u201cToday, the Port Authority is talking about modernizing the airport . . . That\u2019s a good thing,\u201d Schumer (D-N.Y.) said. \u201cBut that\u2019s only half the picture. What about modernizing the working conditions \u2014 the wages, the benefits \u2014 for all the people that work there at the same time?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Rich Schapiro", "twitter": {"description": "Airport workers raged as the Port Authority moved forward with plan to renovate LaGuardia Airport while a benefits package pauses.", "title": "Airport workers upset promised benefits package stays held", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/airport-workers-upset-promised-benefits-package-stays-held-article-1.2239607", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2239605.1432859682!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/blizzard-2015.jpg", "site": "@nydailynews", "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.tags": "LaGuardia Airport, LGA, Port Authority, Daily News' Fight for Fair Pay", "parsely-author": "Rich Schapiro", "parsely-type": "article", "keywords": "LaGuardia Airport, LGA, Port Authority, Daily News' Fight for Fair Pay", "nydn_tags": "laguardia airport, chuck schumer", "news_keywords": "LaGuardia Airport, LGA, Port Authority, Daily News' Fight for Fair Pay", "parsely-link": "http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/airport-workers-upset-promised-benefits-package-stays-held-article-1.2239607", "parsely-title": "Airport workers upset promised benefits package stays held", "sailthru.date": "2015-05-28T20:52:20-0400", "sailthru.title": "Airport workers upset promised benefits package stays held", "nydn_section": "New York", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-05-29T00:52:20", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2239605.1432859682!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/blizzard-2015.jpg", "description": "Airport workers raged as the Port Authority moved forward with plan to renovate LaGuardia Airport while a benefits package pauses.", "robots": "NOARCHIVE", "fb": {"admins": 1594068001, "app_id": 107464888913, "pages": 268914272540}, "msvalidate.01": "02916AAC0DA8B068EFE01D721E03ED7E", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NYDailyNews/"}, "sailthru.description": "Airport workers raged as the Port Authority moved forward with plan to renovate LaGuardia Airport while a benefits package pauses.", "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "parsely-section": "New York", "og": {"site_name": "NY Daily News", "description": "Airport workers raged as the Port Authority moved forward with plan to renovate LaGuardia Airport while a benefits package pauses.", "title": "Airport workers upset promised benefits package stays held", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/airport-workers-upset-promised-benefits-package-stays-held-article-1.2239607", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2239605.1432859682!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/blizzard-2015.jpg", "type": "article"}, "parsely-tags": "laguardia airport, chuck schumer", "parsely-image-url": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2239605.1432859682!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/blizzard-2015.jpg", "p": {"domain_verify": "78efe4f5c9935744af497772f68a0ee7"}, "nydn_byline": "Rich Schapiro", "sailthru.credits": "NEW YORK DAILY NEWS"}, "article_summary": "Airport workers flew into a rage Thursday as the Port Authority moved forward with a plan to renovate LaGuardia Airport while a promised benefits package remains grounded.\n\u201cHow can they modernize the airport while maintaining outdated working conditions?\u201d Newark Airport cabin cleaner Gertrudes Contreras, 60, fumed to Port Authority board members.\nThe airport \u2014 which Vice President Biden famously likened to a Third World country \u2014 is set to undergo a $3.6 billion renovation.\nBut eight months after its own deadline, the Port Authority still hasn\u2019t unveiled its plan laying out future pay raises and expanded medical benefits.\nSanchez spoke before the Port Authority formally selected a team to rebuild LaGuardia Airport\u2019s decrepit central terminal."}
