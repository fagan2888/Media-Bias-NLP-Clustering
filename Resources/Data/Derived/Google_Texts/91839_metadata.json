All that\u2019s known for sure is that no young people have arrived yet.

In fact, the congressman said nothing about whether the buses had been \u201cscheduled\u201d to arrive, or whether they would arrive another day.\n\n\u201cThe only part our office knew for sure is that kids would not be coming on Tuesday \u2026 whether or not they come in the future has not been relayed to us,\u201d Grijalva press aide Dan Lindner told me.\n\nOn Thursday morning the local fire chief told reporters for Tucson News Now that he was asked to do a safety inspection of Sycamore Canyon Ranch, where the young men are supposed to be placed. The request to inspect the ranch came with a sense of \u201curgency,\u201d says Fire Chief Larry Southard. \u201cIt passed.\u201d He believes the ranch will house about 50 boys \u201c14 to 17 years old.\u201d Management at Sycamore Canyon Ranch, run by the Nevada non-profit Rite of Passage, has also told reporters it was asked to house the young men.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Protesters say they stopped the transfer of Central American kids.
