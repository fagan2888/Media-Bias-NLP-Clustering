Lower levels of optimism related to finances and employment could directly impact their future retirement security.\n\n\u201cIn light of rapid population growth among multicultural communities, studies such as our African-American Social Issues Survey allow AARP to address the unique resource and service needs that have resulted from the demographic shift,\u201d Edna Kane-Williams, AARP Vice President, Multicultural Markets and Engagement. \u201cWe realize that decisions like knowing when to claim retirement benefits, making health care choices, seeking employment and financial planning can be complex and different for everyone. AARP is working to provide all people with enough information to make the right choices for themselves and their families.\u201d\n\nAmong the survey\u2019s findings:\n\nWhile the majority of African-Americans 50+ considered all of the social issues AARP asked about as being important, access to quality health care (91%), financial security (91%) and health care information (89%) were seen as most important.\n\nWhen respondents noted more than one issue as extremely or very important, they were asked which of the issues was the single most important one. Access to high quality healthcare was overwhelmingly viewed to be the single most important social issue\u2014by one third (32%) of those who gave multiple responses.\n\nHaving a financially secure retirement was considered the second most important issue (cited by 16% of those with multiple answers), while access to high quality education was the third most important issue (cited by 14% of those with multiple answers).\n\nOptimism is lowest for employment-related issues, with employment discrimination based on age (44%) and race (45%), access to better employment opportunities (48%) and having a financially secure retirement (a by-product of employment) garnering lower optimism levels relative to health, technology and education-related issues.\n\nComplete survey results can be viewed here.\n\nAARP currently offers extensive resources, including free webinars on Social Security and retirement planning, employment search and networking through Life Reimagined for Work, health care information through the AARP Health online portal and technology training at AARP TEK.
