The five test regions are: Virginia; Florida; Louisiana; one region that includes Iowa, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming; and Arizona.\n\nLike Healthcare Finance on Facebook\n\nStand-alone prescription drug programs in these regions can apply to vary the intensity and types of medication therapy management interventions they offer. Beneficiaries will be contacted by their drug plans, pharmacists, or prescribers and offered assistance on their medication use.\n\nCMS is waiving certain program requirements and is increasing access to Medicare Parts A and B data.\n\nThe new model does not directly pay pharmacists.\n\nApplications are due in January 2016. Plans may apply to join in subsequent years.\n\nTwitter: @SusanJMorse", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/cms-test-performance-based-medicare-part-d-program-targets-rising-drug-prices", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/pharmacy-hfn-feature.jpg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "The medication therapy management model is being tested in five regions as an incentive to boost adherence for stand-alone Part D plans not connected with Medicare Advantage.", "title": "CMS to test performance-based Medicare Part D program, targets rising drug prices"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/pharmacy-hfn-feature.jpg"}, "description": "The medication therapy management model is being tested in five regions as an incentive to boost adherence for stand-alone Part D plans not connected with Medicare Advantage.", "site": "@HC_Finance", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "CMS to test performance-based Medicare Part D program, targets rising drug prices"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid's new Part D pilot for medication therapy management will offer performance payments to plans that achieve reductions in fee-for-service expenditures and fulfill quality and other data reporting requirements, according to information released by CMS on Wednesday.", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe157e\"", "article_summary": "The program is aimed at reducing medication related issues in patients as current medication therapy management has not produced the expected results, according to Minter.\nThe Part D Enhanced Medication Therapy Management model will give selected Medicare Prescription Drug Plans flexibility to design programs to improve health and lower costs.\nCMS is launching the five-year experimental model as drug prices have surged and Part D plan premiums are projected to increase.\nThe medication therapy management model is being tested in five regions as an incentive to boost adherence for stand-alone Part D plans not connected with Medicare Advantage.\nBeneficiaries will be contacted by their drug plans, pharmacists, or prescribers and offered assistance on their medication use."}
