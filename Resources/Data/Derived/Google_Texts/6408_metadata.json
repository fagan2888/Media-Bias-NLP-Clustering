But retailers claim they have not had enough time to adopt the new technology. They also claim that by the time they upgrade, there will be newer technologies to prevent credit card fraud, forcing businesses to spend even more money.\n\n\u201cWhile EMV is a step in the right direction that will lead to greater economic efficiency, implementation has been slow on both sides of the equation,\u201d said Rep. Nydia Velazquez (D-N.Y.), the committee\u2019s top Democrat. \u201cMany financial institutions and even more merchants are not yet in compliance. The main barriers have been a lack of awareness in the small business community, high costs to upgrade and disagreements over verification methods.\u201d\n\nStephanie Ericksen, Visa\u2019s vice president of Risk Products, said Visa is currently on a 20-city \u201croad tour\u201d in an effort to help business owners understand the importance of chip card technology and how they can make the switch.\n\nBut Rep. Janice Hahn (D-Calif.) said she did an \u201cinformal survey\u201d of her Los Angeles district and not many small businesses knew of the Oct. 1 deadline.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like a lot of cities to me,\u201d she said about Visa\u2019s road tour.\n\nRep. Brenda Lawrence (D-Mich.) said she was \u201cencouraged\u201d to know that Visa was going to continue their educational programs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to know that providers are also doing some outreach to the small businesses,\u201d she said. \u201cOne of the challenges to small businesses is the access to information and education and so any way we could enhance that ... I would encourage it.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. is behind much of the world on credit card technology.\n\nApproximately 95 percent of payment terminals in Europe already accept chip cards, with Canada, Latin America and the Caribbean not far behind at 80 percent, according to data from the Smart Card Alliance. In the U.S., just over 50 percent of payment terminals are chip-ready this year, according to Aite Group.\n\nMany have blamed this significant gap for the large number of data breaches across the U.S. in recent years. In 2013, a breach at Target exposed 40 million credit card numbers. In 2014, a hack at Home Depot compromised 56 million people\u2019s data.\n\n\u201cEMV is not hack-proof, but it is far safer than the magnetic strip status quo,\u201d Velazquez said.\n\nJan Roche, a member of the board of directors of the National Association of Federal Credit Unions, encouraged committee members to pass the Data Security Act, one of several similar House bills that would set nationwide data security standards.\n\nBut none of the current legislation includes specifics about chip-enabled cards. The bills are more focused on ensuring companies have a modern security plan in place to protect customer data.\n\nThe committee said they would hold another hearing later this year to hear directly from retailers on how Congress can help with the technology transition.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Lawmakers worry the transition is hurting small businesses.", "description": "Lawmakers worry the transition is hurting small businesses.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Kyle Plantz", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Lawmakers worry the transition is hurting small businesses.", "title": "Lawmakers question switch to microchip credit cards", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/256267-lawmakers-question-switch-to-microchip-credit-cards", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/creditcardsgetty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T05:25-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/256267-lawmakers-question-switch-to-microchip-credit-cards", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2015-10-07T16:53-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Meghashyam Mali", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-07T16:53:22-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00"}, "keywords": "Credit cards,,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/256267-lawmakers-question-switch-to-microchip-credit-cards", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Lawmakers worry the transition is hurting small businesses.", "card": "summary", "title": "Lawmakers question switch to microchip credit cards"}, "dcterms.title": "Lawmakers question switch to microchip credit cards"}, "article_summary": "Lawmakers are concerned that financial institutions are rushing a transition to microchip-enabled credit cards, hurting businesses and consumers in the process.\nI would encourage it.\u201dThe U.S. is behind much of the world on credit card technology.\nThe House Small Businesses Committee on Wednesday heard from financial institutions about how a switch to chip-enabled, or EMV, cards is affecting retailers.\nIn 2013, a breach at Target exposed 40 million credit card numbers.\n\u201cOne of the challenges to small businesses is the access to information and education and so any way we could enhance that ..."}
