Q&A with Christine Cserti-Gazdewich: The Progression in Blood Storage Duration







Christine Cserti-Gazdewich, BSc, MD, Blood Transfusion Laboratory, Toronto General Hospital discussed the progress made in blood unit storage.

"Several years ago I was worried about the storage lesion myself, and I would have wondered if I were a patient, was I getting something at the end of shelf life? But, I can honestly say that because of what we found I would not be anxious. We need to be good at management and not throw anything out unnecessarily."
