Dodge, director of the Center for Child and Family Policy at Duke University, in a statement .\n\nThe children in the study\u2019s sample were 8 years old when first recruited, and followed up with annually. They hailed from Japan, the United States, Thailand, and Italy, among others, and belonged to one of twelve distinct cultural groups.\n\nEvery year of the study, their level of aggression was measured via interviews with the child and their mother, and on the third year, they were presented with ten different hypothetical situations involving an \u201cambiguous provocation\u201d directed at them by someone. For each situation they were told to guess whether the hypothetical someone intended them harm or not, and then asked to imagine how they\u2019d respond to them.\n\nEach group of children was more likely to respond with their own hostility when they saw the act as harmful; on average, up to five times more than when the act was thought of as harmless. But certain groups had a higher percentage of children who were seemingly primed to see aggression in the actions of others everywhere, which the researchers called a \u201chostile attributional bias\u201d. This bias was associated with a greater likelihood (and increasing severity) of chronic behavioral problems reported by the mother-child pair, which in turn largely explained the group differences in aggression seen by the authors.\n\n\u201cOur research also indicates that cultures differ in their tendencies to socialize children to become defensive this way, and those differences account for why some cultures have children who act more aggressively than other cultures,\u201d Dodge said. \u201cIt points toward the need to change how we socialize our children, to become more benign and more forgiving and less defensive. It will make our children less aggressive and our society more peaceful.\u201d\n\nFor those wondering, the group of American kids, from Durham, North Carolina, were neither the most or least likely to see a potential threat around every corner. Sweden and China had children with less aggressive tendencies, while Zarqa, Jordan, and Naples, Italy had children with the most.\n\nThough their study could be seen as discouraging to any would-be pacifists, Dodge believes that it may point the way to strategies that can prevent us from perpetuating a cycle of violence onto the next generation.\n\n\u201cThe findings point toward a new wrinkle to the Golden Rule, Not only should we teach our children to do unto others as we would have them do unto ourselves, but also to think about others as we would have them think about us,\u201d Dodge said. \u201dBy teaching our children to give others the benefit of the doubt, we will help them grow up to be less aggressive, less anxious and more competent.\u201d\n\nSource: Dodge, Malone P, Lansford J, et al.
