Sebelius takes tour to Detroit

The pools among politicos and analysts are likely laying odds and taking bets on when Kathleen Sebelius resigns.



Sebelius, secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, was in Detroit last Friday to serve as Cheerleader-in-Chief on the rollout of the Affordable Care Act at a media event in Southwest Detroit.
