The goal, the vice president wrote, is to double the rate of progress being made toward cures for cancer.\n\n\"The goal of this initiative \u2014 this 'moonshot' \u2014 is to seize this moment,\" Biden wrote. \"To accelerate our efforts to progress towards a cure, and to unleash new discoveries and breakthroughs for other deadly diseases.\"\n\nBiden said he's starting things off this Friday by visiting doctors at the University of Pennsylvania medical school and later this month, with meetings with cabinet secretaries about how to further support cancer research.\n\nMedical research has gotten a big boost over the last year, both from the executive branch and from Congress. Early in 2015, Obama announced a precision medicine initiative to gather a huge pool of genetic information researchers can use to develop targeted cures. In the spending agreement Congress agreed to last month, the National Institutes of Health is getting its biggest cash infusion in more than a decade.", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama committed to a new, national effort toward curing cancer in his State of the Union address, saying that he's putting Vice President Joe Biden in charge of it.\nFor the loved ones we've all lost, for the family we can still save, let's make America the country that cures cancer once and for all, Obama told Congress Tuesday night as he received a standing ovation.\nObama didn't provide details on the effort, but he charged Biden with leading it, as the vice president has increasingly called for more cancer research after his son Beau died of brain cancer last year.
