As the Show-Me state increasingly trends toward Republican political domination, young lawyers with big ambitions in the Grand Ol\u2019 Party have one major hurdle to clear: getting noticed.\n\nEnter Associate Professor of Law at the University of Missouri School of Law, Josh Hawley, 35, who just made headlines for his amicus brief, submitted by the Missouri Liberty Project, for a case headed to the Supreme Court that could fundamentally undo President Barack Obama\u2019s signature legislation, the Affordable Care Act.\n\nHawley is familiar with making headlines battling Obamacare. He served as one of the lead attorneys in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby, a sweeping and controversial Supreme Court decision that opened the door for employers to dodge the contraception mandate in the ACA if doing so violated their religious beliefs. Hawley was one of the attorneys working for Hobby Lobby well before the case reached the high court. As counsel to the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, Hawley was working as part of Hobby Lobby\u2019s legal team for years leading up to the case against the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\n\u201cThe Obama administration has been more hostile to religious liberty for people of all faiths than any in our nation\u2019s history,\u201d Hawley said. \u201cReligious liberty, regardless of faith convictions, protects personal freedoms that we as Americans hold dear. It\u2019s a line, the line the government cannot cross in telling groups what they can\u2019t do.\u201d\n\nHawley\u2019s latest foray into a legal fight with Obamacare is manifesting itself in the King v Burwell case. If the Court decides to side with lawyers like Hawley, federal subsidies will not be available in the 34 states \u2014 including Missouri \u2014 that did not establish their own state-run healthcare exchange. Without federal subsidies, the individual mandate and the employer mandate would also go away. In short, a favorable ruling for Hawley and his fellow conservative legal thinkers would effectively dismantle Obama\u2019s healthcare bill in more than half of the states.\n\n\u201cThe voters of Missouri decided in 2012 with a 61 percent margin not to set up an Obamacare exchange and to prohibit the Governor from establishing one through executive order,\u201d Hawley said. \u201cIt\u2019s a decision that the Affordable Care Act invites voters in the states to make. Now the Obama administration is trying to issue a rule saying they will spend federal money and set up exchanges in each state anyway.\u201d\n\nWith bashing Obamacare is a virtual requirement to join the ranks of Missouri Republicans and an increasing fervor among the party\u2019s most conservative wing to battle any and all perceived threats against religious freedom, Hawley\u2019s name is increasingly whispered among players in the Capitol as a man eyeing a run for public office.\n\nHe has the resume. Missouri-born and raised in Lafayette County, a graduate of Yale Law School and Stanford University, Hawley has a reputation as a sharp mind with a knack for explaining complex legalese to average voters. Attorney General would almost certainly be the easiest fit for Hawley\u2019s background and he admits he\u2019s mulling a future in politics.\n\n\u201cAs I\u2019ve traveled around the state to talk about our constitution, I\u2019ve met a lot of folks who have urged me to run for a statewide office or pledged support,\u201d Hawley said. \u201cWhen you have people doing that, you\u2019re definitely going to be giving it some thought. I certainly haven\u2019t made any decisions yet, but I am giving serious thought to whether serving in an elected office is a place to advance the causes I care about.\u201d\n\nHawley\u2019s biggest barrier in any statewide race would, of course, be money. While he makes an appealing AG candidate, Hawley doesn\u2019t have the advantage of currently serving in an elected office like the state\u2019s two other declared interested parties: Senators Kurt Schaefer, a Republican, of Columbia and Scott Sifton, a Democrat, of St. Louis.\n\nSchaefer was perhaps the first person to publicly declare his 2016 intentions, announcing more than a year ago his desire to serve as Missouri\u2019s Attorney General. Schaefer has spent the last few years raising money and trying to end a primary before it even begins.\n\nHawley\u2019s focus on religious liberty cases allows him to pivot nicely to a broader \u2014 and decidedly campaign-feeling \u2014 rhetorical point.\n\n\u201cThe fight for religious liberty is the fight for personal freedom writ large,\u201d Hawley said. \u201cThe latest Obamacare case isn\u2019t religious, but it\u2019s sure about personal freedom.\u201d\n\nHawley\u2019s ambitions may not need to trend toward electoral politics. He makes an appealing pick for the appellate court system under the next Republican president, a slot that wouldn\u2019t involve running against a well-funded opponent who hails from the same metropolitan region as your own.\n\nNo matter what he seeks next, Hawley pledged to continue to seek out legal cases where religious liberty was in need of defense, saying that \u201cpeople of all faiths\u201d needed protections from \u2018aggressive\u201d federal government overreach.\n\n\u201cStates are important players in defending the constitution,\u201d Hawley said. \u201cHistorically when we see an assault on constitutional liberties, it\u2019s often the states that end up as the defenders of those liberties.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Missouri Times", "description": "JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. \u2014 There\u2019s no shortage of conservative lawyers in Missouri.
