Democratic lawmakers, citing missed deadlines and past failures, have begun to call for Vermont Governor Peter Shumlin to \"shelve\" the plan.\n\n\u201cThe deadlines for proposing financing have been missed two years in a row now, so to me that\u2019s very disappointing. It\u2019s becoming clearer and clearer that there is no financing plan,\u201d Condon told Vermont Watchdog.\n\nThe cost of one year of Green Mountain Care is estimated to be anywhere from 1.6 to 2.2 billion dollars. This is equal to the entire tax revenue of the state of Vermont.\n\nSen. Bobby Starr, another Democrat who voted against Act 48, told Vermont Watchdog in January there\u2019s \u201cno way\u201d single-payer can work without new taxes. Indeed, no lawmaker has introduced any bill that would finance single-payer health care without also raising taxes.\n\nIt's foolish for Vermont to even entertain the thought of a single-payer system when its attempt at implementing an Obamacare exchange didn't go so well. Green Mountain Care is way too expensive for the state, and raising taxes is going to make an already business-unfriendly state even worse.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"It\u2019s becoming clearer and clearer that there is no financing plan.\".05/25/2016 14:58:38PM EST.", "author": "Christine Rousselle", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "\"It\u2019s becoming clearer and clearer that there is no financing plan.\"", "title": "- Vermont Democrats Labeling State's Single-Payer Health Plan a Failure", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/christinerousselle/2014/03/18/vermont-democrats-labeling-states-singlepayer-health-plan-a-failure-n1810856", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/52/d46f322e-9a39-41ba-8a15-e5e513a41b28.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "\"It\u2019s becoming clearer and clearer that there is no financing plan.\"", "title": "- Vermont Democrats Labeling State's Single-Payer Health Plan a Failure", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/christinerousselle/2014/03/18/vermont-democrats-labeling-states-singlepayer-health-plan-a-failure-n1810856", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/52/d46f322e-9a39-41ba-8a15-e5e513a41b28.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Vermont Democrats Labeling State's Single-Payer Health Plan a Failure, Christine Rousselle, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf62a\"", "article_summary": "The cost of one year of Green Mountain Care is estimated to be anywhere from 1.6 to 2.2 billion dollars.\nIt\u2019s becoming clearer and clearer that there is no financing plan,\u201d Condon told Vermont Watchdog.\nIn 2011, Vermont passed the nation's first single-payer healthcare system, \"Green Mountain Care.\"\nSen.
