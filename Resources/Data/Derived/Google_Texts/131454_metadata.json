The number of treatment beds is grossly and visibly inadequate. Good supportive clinical care is becoming increasingly difficult to implement,\u201d according to the WHO.\n\nPresident Obama is pressuring health and security officials across the globe to join the effort, urging them to dedicate any resource they can, from basic supplies to advanced medical technologies.\n\nObama is also challenging countries to use the momentum surrounding Ebola to prevent future outbreaks. Addressing a group of international leaders on Friday, Obama said every nation should have the capacity to fight infectious disease outbreaks like Ebola, or all countries will be at risk.\n\n\u201cIn a world as interconnected as ours, outbreaks anywhere \u2014 even in the most remote villages in the most remote corners of the world \u2014 have the potential to impact everybody in every nation,\u201d he told the global health security summit on Friday.\n\nThere has been some positive news. A second American doctor was declared virus-free this week after he received blood transfusions from another survivor and was injected with the experimental drug, TKM-Ebola.\n\nTwo West African countries \u2014 Senegal and Nigeria \u2014 have successfully fended off an outbreak, reporting no new cases in the last several weeks.\n\nAs the demand for experimental drugs continues to grow, some of the world\u2019s biggest pharmaceutical companies are rising to the challenge. Next week, global drug giant GlaxoSmithKline will begin trials in Mali. It has already tested its drug in the U.S. and Germany.\n\nCongress is also monitoring the situation. Members of the Energy and Commerce Committee have been briefed regularly by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) on the Ebola outbreak during the recess period.\n\nLawmakers had sent a letter to the HHS requesting details on the government\u2019s response to Ebola \u2014 with a Friday deadline. They also announced plans to hold a hearing with high-level officials when they return in November.\n\nAt home, 115,000 people could lose their healthcare coverage because the government can\u2019t confirm that they legally live in the U.S.\n\nInitially, 1 million people were in danger of losing their coverage. But after calls, emails and letters from the HHS, most people provided the additional information and are on track to keep their healthcare.\n\nTwo weeks ago, HHS officials announced 115,000 people still hadn\u2019t answered the government\u2019s call and would lose their coverage on Sept. 30. A spokesman for the departent said he was unable to provide an updated set of numbers on Friday.\n\nThere\u2019s another looming ObamaCare deadline. After Oct. 1, insurers can no longer renew plans that don\u2019t meet certain standards under the Affordable Care Act. Rep. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) has sought to challenge this law with his \u201ckeep your plan\u201d bill, which passed the House last week but stands no chance in the Democratic-controlled Senate.\n\nPhiladelphia-area veterans will get the chance to sound off about their medical care at a hearing on Oct. 3. The meeting on the Department of Veterans Affairs\u2019s regional office will take place in New Jersey, hosted by the Subcommittee on Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs.\n\nThe VA has been back in the news as House Republicans allege that the HHS interfered with an independent auditor\u2019s report. Speaker John Boehner John BoehnerOvernight Finance: Puerto Rico bill clears panel | IRS chief vows to finish term | Bill would require nominees to release tax returns Overnight Defense: Pentagon chief fears sequestration's return GOP senator: Reid's 'ramblings' are 'bitter, vulgar, incoherent' MORE (R-Ohio) sent a letter to VA Secretary Bob McDonald requesting a new audit that the Health Department doesn\u2019t get to read in advance.\n\nWhich government workers are using their credit cards to pay for gym memberships? The House Oversight\u2019s Subcommittee on Government Operations will hold a hearing Oct. 2 on the matter.\n\nPETA will begin running ads around D.C. on Monday urging the National Institutes of Health to end psychological experiments on baby monkeys.
