It\u2019s estimated the number of those affected was in the four-figure range.\n\nThe EEOC said the tests weren\u2019t sufficiently \u201cjob-related and consistent with business necessity\u201d to pass muster under the Civil Rights Act.\n\nTo make matters worse, the EEOC said one of those assessments also violated the ADA. It said that assessment was performed by psychologists and qualified as a pre-employment medical exam, which are prohibited by the ADA. Only after being given an offer of employment can an employee be asked to undergo a medical exam, and it has to either be part of a voluntary wellness program or \u201cjob-related and consistent with business necessity.\u201d\n\nFinally, the EEOC claimed that Target committed record-keeping violations by failing to maintain records sufficient enough to assess the impact of its hiring procedures.\n\nThe EEOC likely would\u2019ve filed suit against Target for the alleged offenses, but it\u2019s first required to enter into its conciliation process.\n\nDuring that process, Target agreed to settle for $2.8 million, which will be distributed to those individuals deemed to have been adversely affected by its hiring processes.\n\nTarget spokesperson Molly Snyder told Fortune that the company decided to settle with the EEOC because of the significant resources that would be required if the case were to go to court.\n\nAs part of the agreement, Target has said it will also:\n\nnot use the assessments in question again\n\nchange its applicant tracking system to ensure the collection of data is sufficient to assess adverse impact\n\nperform a predictive validity study for all assessments currently in use and any new assessments it expects to use in the future\n\nmonitor assessments for adverse impact, and\n\nprovide the EEOC with a detailed summary of the company\u2019s studies and any adverse impact analysis it completes.\n\n\u201cWe applaud Target for taking corrective action to ensure the validity of their hiring practices,\u201d said EEOC Chair Jenny R. Yang in a statement released by the agency. \u201cThis resolution demonstrates the benefits of working with EEOC and serves as a model for businesses committed to effective and lawful selection procedures.\u201d\n\nSnyder went on to tell Fortune that despite the fact that the EEOC found tests that had potential adverse impact on applicants, no disparities in Target\u2019s hiring practices were found.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"description": "The EEOC has found some of Target Corporation\u2019s pre-hire assessments wanting.", "title": "Pre-hire assessments have Target Corp. on the hook for $2.8M", "url": "http://www.hrmorning.com/pre-hire-assessments-have-target-corp-on-the-hook-for-2-8m/", "image": {"width": 437, "identifier": "http://www.hrmorning.com/wp-content/uploads/Stacked-Money1.jpg", "height": 286}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.hrmorning.com/wp-content/uploads/Stacked-Money1.jpg?w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "keywords": "EEOC, assessments, testing, hiring", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-26T19:03:44+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-26T19:03:45+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "For starters, the EEOC said three pre-hire employment assessments Target used disproportionately screened out applicants for exempt professional positions based on race and sex.\nThe EEOC has found some of Target Corporation\u2019s pre-hire assessments wanting.\n\u201cWe applaud Target for taking corrective action to ensure the validity of their hiring practices,\u201d said EEOC Chair Jenny R.
