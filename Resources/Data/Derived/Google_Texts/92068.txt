The two recent big decisions by the U.S. Supreme Court on the subsidies provided by the Affordable Care Act and the legalization of same-sex marriage have both had an impact on health care – directly and indirectly.

In the King v. Burwell decision, the court upheld federal subsidies in state-run health care market places. The decision to legalize gay marriage opened the door for more people to qualify for health insurance coverage.

"The marriage equality decision … opens up couples to be able to pursue health insurance,” said Dante McKay during an interview on “A Closer Look.” McKay is the Georgia director of Enroll America, one of the nation’s leading health care enrollment organizations.

McKay discussed medical coverage for same-sex couples, financial assistance for married couples, federal health care subsidies and more on “A Closer Look.”
