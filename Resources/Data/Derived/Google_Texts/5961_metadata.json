Today, lawyers were given a turn.\n\nA long-awaited hearing was held at the state Insurance Department. At issue is a complaint filed by an East Rochester woman over alleged harm suffered at the hands of Anthem\u2019s limited network of hospitals.\n\nMargaret McCarthy was a bookkeeper and office manager, but now, in her early 60s, she\u2019s content volunteering as treasurer of her church.\n\nWithout full-time employment, she\u2019s been buying an insurance policy through Anthem that until recently, she was happy with. That is, until she learned that the state\u2019s largest insurer was limiting the number of hospitals for its new plans sold through the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cI do not want to give up my doctor. And that\u2019s plural: doctors. Every doctor I see is affiliated with Frisbie,\u201d says McCarthy.\n\nThe Rochester-facility is one of 10 New Hampshire hospitals excluded from the network for plans sold under Obamacare; a move Anthem says reduces the price tag for these policies by 25%.\n\nMcCarthy says if she buys a different plan that includes her doctors, she\u2019s out nearly $3,000 dollars because she wouldn\u2019t be able to access subsidies through healthcare.gov.\n\nSo along with Frisbie, McCarthy filed a complaint with the Insurance Department. She says she is happy to be the face of this fight.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely, I feel like I was the voice for all the people that sort of got left out of this network,\u201d says McCarthy.\n\nISSUE TURNS TECHNICAL\n\nDuring five-and-a-half hours of testimony Wednesday, lawyers for both the Insurance Department and Anthem presented evidence they say proves the narrow network doesn\u2019t violate any laws.\n\nOne factor that regulators consider before approving plans is if patients are within a reasonable distance to in-network doctors and hospitals.\n\nAn example: no more than 15 miles to a primary care practice.\n\nRichard McCaffrey, a lawyer for the Insurance Department, used thumb tacks on an oversized map of Strafford County to show McCarthy that she wouldn\u2019t have to travel all that far to the next nearest hospital.\n\n\u201cYour house as the crow flies is 11 miles from Wentworth Douglas?\u201d McCaffrey asked.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s about right, yup,\u201d responded McCarthy. \u201cHard to travel in a car that way, though.\u201d\n\nDEPARTMENT SAYS ITS HANDS ARE TIED\n\nThere\u2019s also the question of if the Department has the legal ability to tell Anthem who to make its deals with.\n\nWith Deputy Commissioner Alex Feldvebel on the stand, Attorney McCaffrey asked, \u201cDoes either of our network adequacy laws allow the Insurance Department to dictate to an insurance company, say Anthem, that it must contract with any particular hospitals, providers or other medical providers or services?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, we don\u2019t have that authority,\u201d Feldvebel responded.\n\nLawyers for McCarthy question that lack of authority. They say if there\u2019s been a wrong committed here, the Department does have the power to make it right.\n\nInsurance Department Commissioner Roger Sevigny will get the final say on the issue. He\u2019s giving both sides two more weeks to submit any final paperwork before he issues a ruling.\n\nFrisbie President Al Felgar says regardless of the outcome, he\u2019s happy the issue is finally getting its day.\n\n\u201cWell, let\u2019s see what the Commissioner says. Maybe there is some compromise here? You know, compromise is part of life,\u201d says Felgar.\n\nThe whole issue may resolve itself in 2015, when more insurance companies will likely begin selling plans through the exchange that have a much broader network of hospitals.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health", "description": "Politicians in New Hampshire have done plenty of arguing over the Affordable Care Act.
