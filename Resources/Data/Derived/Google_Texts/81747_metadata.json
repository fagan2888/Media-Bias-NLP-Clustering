It\u2019s my third one, and each one gets better and better each year.\u201d\n\nNot for the Bearcats, who lost to Butler on their home court last week and dropped another one to the school located only 2 \u00bd miles away. Octavius Ellis had 13 points for Cincinnati, which never led and never got closer than five points in the second half.\n\nUsually, the winner of the crosstown games comes away with a season highlight. For Xavier, it was just one in a series of them.\n\n\u201cEverybody has a ton of confidence in the other person,\u201d Davis said. \u201cWhen you have that, anything is possible. We expect this from everybody. Everybody plays their part, and with that comes winning.\u201d\n\nIt was the first time the game was played at Xavier\u2019s Cintas Center since four years ago, when a brawl between the schools prompted the officials to call the game with 9.4 seconds left and the Musketeers up 76-53.\n\nAlso, it was the first time that both teams were ranked in the matchup since 1993-94. Xavier won that one, too.\n\nThe only smudge on Xavier\u2019s opening half was the way leading scorer Trevon Bluiett got a slow start, missing his first five shots. He had a three-point play during a 9-0 run that built the lead to 18.\n\nXavier took a 42-26 lead into halftime - the most points Cincinnati had allowed in an opening half this season. The Musketeers shot 50 percent from the field and had a 20-12 advantage in rebounds, including eight offensive boards.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got no chance,\u201d Cincinnati coach Mick Cronin said. \u201cYou\u2019re not coming back from 16 down here unless you rain in a lot of 3s.\u201d\n\nCincinnati struggled against Xavier\u2019s 1-3-1 zone defense in the second half and finished 7 of 26 from beyond the arc.\n\nThe Musketeers missed their first four shots to open the second half, and Cincinnati went on a 10-point run that got it down to 42-36 - the closest the Bearcats had been since the game\u2019s opening minutes. Davis hit a pull-up jumper and a 3-pointer that rebuilt the lead to double digits.\n\nFreshman Edmond Sumner had a driving dunk as Xavier kept turning back Cincinnati. Jalen Reynolds had back-to-back hook shots that put Xavier up 64-51 with 2:22 left.\n\nSERIES STUFF\n\nXavier has won seven straight in the series as the home team. \u2026 The Musketeers are 8-0 when they\u2019re ranked for the rivalry game. \u2026 After the brawl, the annual game was moved to a neutral site - a downtown arena - for two years before returning to campus last season, with Cincinnati losing on its home court 59-57. \u2026 Both coaches got technical fouls for arguing calls.\n\nTIP-INS\n\nCincinnati: Freshman guard Jacob Evans, who twisted his left ankle in UC\u2019s last game, played with a brace on the ankle and had four points in 18 minutes.\n\nXavier: Bluiett had scored 21 and 22 points in the last two games, part of back-to-back double-doubles. He finished with a season-low three points on 1-for-8 shooting.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nCincinnati: The Bearcats host Norfolk State on Tuesday.\n\nXavier: The Musketeers host Auburn next Saturday, completing a stretch of four straight home games.\n\n___\n\nFollow Joe Kay on Twitter: http://twitter.com/apjoekay", "article_metadata": {"description": "The crosstown rivalry is becoming an annual delight for Xavier.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The crosstown rivalry is becoming an annual delight for Xavier.", "title": "No. 12 Xavier again beats rival No. 23 Cincinnati, 65-55", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/dec/12/no-12-xavier-again-beats-rival-no-23-cincinnati-65/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/12/12/cincinnati_xavier_basketball.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/12/12/cincinnati_xavier_basketball.jpeg", "description": "The crosstown rivalry is becoming an annual delight for Xavier.", "card": "summary", "title": "No. 12 Xavier again beats rival No. 23 Cincinnati, 65-55"}, "Author": "JOE KAY", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "Xavier took a 42-26 lead into halftime - the most points Cincinnati had allowed in an opening half this season.\nOctavius Ellis had 13 points for Cincinnati, which never led and never got closer than five points in the second half.\nPlaying its nearby rival at home, 12th-ranked Xavier ran out to an 18-point lead and beat No.\nXavier: The Musketeers host Auburn next Saturday, completing a stretch of four straight home games.\n23 Cincinnati for the third straight time, 65-55 on Saturday."}
