That is, the company would no longer use ingredients derived from modern biotech crops in its foods.\n\nChipotle says it sells \"food with integrity.\" The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines integrity as \"the quality of being honest and fair.\" The company, alas, is being neither honest nor fair about the safety and environmental benefits provided by modern biotech crops.\n\nThe company offers three \"key\" reasons for rejecting genetically-modified ingredients. The first: \"We don't believe the scientific community has reached a consensus on the long-term implications of widespread GMO cultivation and consumption.\" As evidence for this statement, the company notes that \"in October 2013 a group of about 300 scientists from around the world signed a statement rejecting the claim that there is a scientific consensus on the safety of GMOs for human consumption.\" Three hundred whole scientists!\n\nSo who are these GMO rejecters? The cited statement was issued by a notorious anti-biotech claque, the European Network of Scientists for Social and Environmental Responsibility. Among the signers are such anti-biotech luminaries as Charles Benbrook, Vandana Shiva, and Gilles-\u00c9ric S\u00e9ralini. Benbrook regularly (and incorrectly) claims that planting biotech crops has boosted pesticide applications; Vandana Shiva lies about biotech crop failures causing farmer suicides in India; Seralini produced a bogus study in 2013 that claimed that mice fed biotech corn developed breast cancer. (The study was later retracted.)\n\nThe plain fact is that every independent scientific body that has ever evaluated the safety of modern biotech crops has deemed them safe for human beings to eat. This includes the Food and Drug Administration, the American Medical Association, the European Commission, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and many more.\n\nChipotle's second \"key reason\" for rejecting modern biotech ingredients is that \"the cultivation of GMOs can damage the environment.\" As evidence, the company cites a Washington State University study \"that estimated that between 1996 and 2011, pesticide and herbicide use increased by more than 400 million pounds as a result of GMO cultivation.\" The principal researcher was none other than the aforementioned activist Charles Benbrook, and the funding for Benbrook's study was supplied by leading anti-biotech groups, including the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy, Consumers Union, the Union of Concerned Scientists, and the Organic Center. But as it happens, you don't have to depend on estimates by activists for this data; there are actual figures available, and they show that farmers who plant biotech crops use less pesticides overall.\n\nIn May 2014, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) National Agricultural Statistics Service issued its comprehensive report Pesticide Use in U.S. Agriculture, updating national herbicide and insecticide usage trends. The agency found that herbicide usage peaked at 478 million pounds in 1981\u2014a decade and half prior to the introduction of the first biotech crop varieties\u2014and fell to 394 million pounds in 2008. So instead of a massive increase in herbicide spraying, as claimed by Benbrook, the USDA actually reports a modest decline. Insecticide applications peaked in 1972 at 158 million pounds, dropping to 29 million pounds in 2008.\n\nIt's worth noting that the insecticide DDT accounted for 11 percent of all agricultural pesticides used in 1972. Since biotech crops can protect themselves against insect pests, there is far less need for farmers to spray their crops.\n\nIn November 2014, German researchers reviewed 147 agronomic studies and similarly reported that \"on average, GM technology adoption has reduced chemical pesticide use by 37 percent, increased crop yields by 22 percent, and increased farmer profits by 68 percent.\"\n\nWhat really does cause damage to the environment? Growing low-yield crops, because that means more land must be plowed down instead of being left for nature. And organic farming generally produces lower yields than conventional farming. A 2012 review in the journal Nature found that \"overall, organic yields are 25 percent lower than conventional yields.\"\n\nThe latest figures from the USDA note that about 408 million acres of land in 2007 were devoted to growing crops. If the Nature study is accurate, going organic would mean plowing up an extra 100 million acres of land to produce the same amount of food. That's bigger than California and Indiana combined.\n\nChipotle notes that many of the beverages it sells \"contain genetically modified ingredients, including those containing corn syrup, which is almost always made from GMO corn.\" Scientifically speaking, this is nonsense. After processing, corn syrup contains no detectable levels of genetic material, either \"natural\" or biotech. Chipotle also minces words when it comes to the cheese it uses. The commercial cheeses served by Chipotle are curdled using rennin derived from genetically engineered bacteria. But Chipotle says that's OK because it is classified as a \"processing aid\" and no nasty GMO genes are actually in the cheese. Sort of like corn syrup in soft drinks.\n\nChipotle's third \"key reason\" is that the restaurant \"should be a place where people can eat food made with non-GMO ingredients.\" Why? The company states, \"In our quest to serve the best ingredients, we decided to remove the few GMOs in our food so that our customers who choose to avoid them can enjoy eating at Chipotle.\" Basically, this is a marketing ploy aimed at appealing to customers who have been bamboozled into thinking that organic is good and biotech is bad.\n\nThe customer is always right, even when they are wrong. Companies are free to educate their customers or, like Chipotle, to try to take advantage of their ignorance. Many are choosing the second course.\n\nConsequently, a lot of retailers have now introduced organic and \"natural\" food products to supply the market based on ignorance. Target's Simply Balanced brand, for example, debuted in 2013. Simply Balanced organic flour goes for $5.34 per five-pound bag, while the same amount of Gold Medal All Purpose unbleached flour sells for $2.49. Simply Balanced Mac & Cheese goes for $1.29 for six ounces, compared to Kraft's Deluxe Mac & Cheese for $1.12. Sixteen ounces of Simply Balanced organic spaghetti sells for $2.29, while Barilla regularly goes for $1.34 and Target's non-organic Market Pantry house brand can be had for $1.24. Simply Balanced organic marinara sauce costs $3.34 for 24 ounces; Barilla sells that much for $1.99. Simply Balanced organic peanut butter costs $5.99 per pound, whereas Jif Crunchy peanut butter goes for $2.20. Even Jif's \"natural\" crunchy peanut butter is just $2.49.\n\nA similar recent price comparison between Kroger's Simple Truth organic products and the chain's conventional products finds that your best grocery-store dollar bet is on regular foods. Organic products are more expensive, and they provide no extra taste or nutrition benefits. Still, Simple Truth sales reached $1.2 billion by the end of 2014.\n\nThe chief reason that Chipotle, or any company, is eschewing ingredients from modern biotech crops is to profit by catering to their customers' preferences. But will they? Perhaps not.\n\nConsider the case of non-GMO Cheerios. In 2014, General Mills announced with great fanfare that it was dropping biotech ingredients in its iconic Cheerios cereal. The move has apparently had no effect on sales. CEO Ken Powell told the Associated Press that the company was \"not really seeing anything there that we can detect\" in terms of a sales lift. He further opined that genetically modified organisms aren't really a concern for most customers.\n\nAlso in 2014, Boulder Brands, maker of Smart Balance Buttery Spread, announced that it too was going GMO-free. After eight months, CEO Steve Hughes admitted, \"We have not seen a widespread lift in our sales due to the non-GMO launch.\"\n\nStill, dupes of anti-biotech propaganda are evidently buying more quack non-GMO products. According to a recent estimate, sales of non-GMO products in the U.S. reached $8.5 billion last year and are growing faster than many conventional food products. Private companies like Chipotle certainly have the right to try to sell whatever they want. But they cannot claim that they are acting with integrity.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Chipotle goes non-GMO and makes unscientific arguments based on anti-biotech activist propaganda", "title": "By Feeding Bogus GMO Fears, Chipotle Treats Customers Like Idiots", "url": "http://reason.com/archives/2015/05/08/chipotle-claims-integrity-but-is-actuall", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14310910479764.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@reason", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14310910479764.jpg", "description": "Chipotle goes non-GMO and makes unscientific arguments based on anti-biotech activist propaganda", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "By Feeding Bogus GMO Fears, Chipotle Treats Customers Like Idiots"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "HomePage", "published_time": "2015-05-08T14:15:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/ronald-bailey"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "article_summary": "Since biotech crops can protect themselves against insect pests, there is far less need for farmers to spray their crops.\nChipotle's second \"key reason\" for rejecting modern biotech ingredients is that \"the cultivation of GMOs can damage the environment.\"\nIn 2014, General Mills announced with great fanfare that it was dropping biotech ingredients in its iconic Cheerios cereal.\nThe company, alas, is being neither honest nor fair about the safety and environmental benefits provided by modern biotech crops.\nAccording to a recent estimate, sales of non-GMO products in the U.S. reached $8.5 billion last year and are growing faster than many conventional food products."}
