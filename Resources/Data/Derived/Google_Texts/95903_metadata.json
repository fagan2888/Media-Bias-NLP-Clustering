A second Jewish defendant, whose name was withheld due to his age, was charged as an accessory.\n\nDefense lawyers said the pair had given false confessions under torture in close-door interrogations, an allegation denied by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the Shin Bet security agency.\n\nREAD: Attack that killed toddler prompts Israel to OK holding suspects without trial\n\n\u201cI doubt such confessions will stand up in court,\u201d lawyer Hai Haber told reporters. \u201cWe know there\u2019s no significant external evidence linking the suspects to this incident.\u201d\n\nThe attack in Duma village and ensuing Israeli investigation laid bare fissures in Netanyahu\u2019s coalition government, where one ultra-nationalist partner voiced misgivings about the handling of Jewish suspects.\n\nThirteen other Israeli Jews, most of them minors, were also indicted for hate crimes, including assaulting a Palestinian, vandalism of Arab property and setting fire to a church.\n\nReferred to in Israel as \u201cprice-tag attacks,\u201d such offenses have usually been carried out in what the attackers say are reprisals for Palestinian violence against Israelis or government curbs on unauthorized West Bank settlement building.\n\nSaad Dawabsheh\u2019s brother Naser said he hoped the defendants would receive the maximum penalty, but was skeptical of Israel\u2018s seriousness in prosecuting the case.\n\nREAD: Israel\u2019s enemy within: Young militant settlers\n\n\u201cWe have no trust in the Israeli judiciary. They would not have launched an investigation were it not for the international pressure on them,\u201d he said, accusing the government of effectively \u201csupport(ing) the terrorism conducted by (West Bank) settlers against our people.\u201d\n\nThe time it has taken Israel to crack down on the Jewish militants, compared to the speedy and sometimes lethal response by state security forces to similar actions by Arabs, has angered Palestinians, contributing to a wave of stabbings, car-rammings and shooting attacks againstIsraelis since Oct. 1.\n\nTwenty-one Israelis and a U.S. citizen have died in the latest bloodshed, a number that will rise if police deem a Tel Aviv shooting that killed two people on Friday as a pro-Palestinian attack. The gunman, an Israeli Arab, is at large.\n\nIsraeli forces or armed civilians have killed at least 132 Palestinians, 82 of whom authorities described as assailants. Most of the others were killed in clashes with security forces.\n\nIsraeli Agriculture Minister Uri Ariel of the ultra-nationalist Jewish Home party had urged a high-level investigation of the allegations that the Duma defendants were tortured and for a Shin Bet overhaul. His party\u2019s leaders, Education Minister Naftali Bennett and Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked, disagreed.\n\nIsraeli officials said their investigation into the attacks by far-right Jews were hampered by the suspects\u2019 operating in small, tight-knit cells and eluding electronic surveillance.\n\nNetanyau said the indictments demonstrated the rule of law in Israel, telling his cabinet in broadcast remarks: \u201cWe oppose murder of all kinds. We oppose violence of all kinds.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Beliefs, Benjamin Netanyahu, Duma, Israel, Jerusalem, terrorism, West Bank", "generator": "Easy Digital Downloads v2.5.16", "og": {"site_name": "Religion News Service", "description": "Palestinians are angry that a crackdown on Jewish militants took months while state security forces react swiftly if Jews are attacked.", "title": "Israel charges two in July arson deaths of a Palestinian toddler and his parents", "url": "http://religionnews.com/2016/01/03/israel-charges-two-in-july-arson-deaths-of-a-palestinian-child-and-his-parents/", "image": "http://religionnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/RNS-ISRAEL-DEATH080415.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@RNS", "card": "summary"}, "syndication-source": "http://religionnews.com/2016/01/03/israel-charges-two-in-july-arson-deaths-of-a-palestinian-child-and-his-parents/", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://religionnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-RNS_logo_RGB-336x336.gif", "original-source": "http://religionnews.com/2016/01/03/israel-charges-two-in-july-arson-deaths-of-a-palestinian-child-and-his-parents/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "Palestinians are angry that a crackdown on Jewish militants took months while state security forces react swiftly if Jews are attacked."}, "article_summary": "READ: Attack that killed toddler prompts Israel to OK holding suspects without trial\u201cI doubt such confessions will stand up in court,\u201d lawyer Hai Haber told reporters.\nAmiram Ben-Uliel, a 21-year-old from a Jewish settlement in the West Bank, was charged with three counts of racially motivated murder at Lod court near Tel Aviv.\nThe attack on July 31 killed 18-month-old Ali Dawabsheh and his parents Saad and Riham.\nNetanyau said the indictments demonstrated the rule of law in Israel, telling his cabinet in broadcast remarks: \u201cWe oppose murder of all kinds.\nReferred to in Israel as \u201cprice-tag attacks,\u201d such offenses have usually been carried out in what the attackers say are reprisals for Palestinian violence against Israelis or government curbs on unauthorized West Bank settlement building."}
