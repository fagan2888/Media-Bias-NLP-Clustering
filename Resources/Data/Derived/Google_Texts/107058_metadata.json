When it comes to economics, the bright lights are on the Greek crisis. The nation\u2019s capital seems almost sleepy, a relief from the bitterness of manufactured showdowns and an actual shutdown.\n\nAll of which could be a false dawn of comity and relatively rational governance. Unless Republicans in Congress begin negotiating in earnest this summer with their Democratic colleagues and the president, this fall could again be dominated by fiscal Armageddon.\n\nA crisis is completely avoidable. The need to scrap the irrational budgeting process dictated by \u201csequestration\u201d \u2014 a dreadful word that refers to artificial boundaries on what government should and shouldn\u2019t spend money on \u2014 is obvious. This doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019ll dodge the crisis or finally toss sequestration into the fiscal dustbin.\n\nRepublicans, who suffered politically after every shutdown since the Clinton years, ought to be eager to forge a middle-of-the-road budget agreement and make life easier for their 2016 presidential candidates. If they can elect a president, they\u2019ll have much more freedom to work their will.\n\nBut for many in the GOP, the temptation to repeat the past is irresistible. With control of both houses of Congress, they hope the House and Senate can agree on a budget and either force it on President Obama or blame him for a shutdown.\n\nLet\u2019s count the flaws in this thinking.\n\nRepublicans still lack complete control of the legislative process. The GOP used the Senate filibuster rules requiring 60 votes on bills to wield power with a minority of seats during Obama\u2019s first six years. Democrats are doing the same thing in the final two.\n\nThe crucial event, little noticed, came on June 18 when Democrats mustered all but one of their 46 caucus members to block consideration of the defense appropriations bill.\n\nEnough Democrats support the higher levels of defense spending the bill provided that Republicans thought they could get to 60 votes. But as Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) explained in an interview, even the staunchest pro-defense Democrats understood that Republicans were trying to box Democrats in on negotiations over other spending by passing the defense bill first \u2014 and by boosting military spending levels with budget gimmicks. It makes little sense to lift spending caps for defense but to keep them in place for everything else and force steep cuts in what Schumer called \u201cbread-and-butter priorities.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not waiting for the end,\u201d said Schumer. \u201cWe\u2019re heading them off at the pass.\u201d\n\nThis means that the key to preventing a crisis is to negotiate on the whole budget and not pretend it can be passed in pieces. By making their position clear early on, said Schumer, who is expected to become his party\u2019s Senate leader after the 2016 elections, Democrats have left plenty of time to reach agreement this summer on a compromise similar to the fiscal plan amicably worked out in 2013 by Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.). \u201cLet\u2019s sit down and negotiate the way Murray and Ryan negotiated,\u201d Schumer said.\n\nThe notion that Democrats, including Obama, could ever agree to what the Republicans are proposing is, well, absurd. As Jonathan Weisman reported in the New York Times this week, the Republicans are, among other things, proposing to cripple the Affordable Care Act, eliminate the federal government\u2019s main family planning program, block enforcement of a variety of environmental regulations and stop the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s net neutrality rules.\n\nAnd Shaun Donovan, Obama\u2019s budget director, has made clear in a series of letters to Congress that the administration can never agree to the sharp reductions the GOP would make, for starters, to education spending, college loans, Head Start, federal enforcement of labor and worker safety standards, Social Security administration and national service programs.\n\nRepublicans may control the House and Senate, but Democrats still have the White House and plenty of power. In these circumstances, some Republicans are level-headed enough to see that negotiations starting immediately are the only way to sidestep tomfoolery. \u201cThe reality is we still live in a divided government,\u201d Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.) told Weisman. \u201cIt\u2019s time to sit down and see if we can make a deal.\u201d\n\nWith Europe in turmoil and China confronting a stock market crash, Congress should do all it can to keep our economy steady. Draconian budget cuts and shutdown threats are not only bad politics but also a deeply flawed and irresponsible approach to governing. The time to make a deal is now.\n\nRead more from E.J.
