Sycamore Partners, the private equity firm which has pursued retailers such as Aeropostale Inc. and Talbots Inc., has raised nearly $2 billion for the follow-up to its 2012 vintage fund.

The New York firm is targeting $2.5 billion for Sycamore PartnersII LP, and expects to have a final close on that amount “in the near future,” said a person familiar with the fundraising effort.
