That message ordered one faction to stop illegally operating the tribe\u2019s Rolling Hills Casino, and stated that the agency recognized the elected tribal council as the tribe\u2019s legitimate governing body, and would continue to do so until the tribe resolves its internal dispute according to its own laws and practices. But the BIA\u2019s intervention did not end the dispute: an appeal of the cease and desist order was filed almost immediately and the conflict continues.\n\nTroy Burdick, the superintendent of the BIA\u2019s Sacramento office, issued the administrative cease-and-desist order in a letter based on information received from the State Attorney General's Office and the Tehama County Sheriff's Office.\n\nBurdick said the BIA recognizes the last elected tribal council of Andrew Freeman, chairman; David Swearinger, vice chairman; Leslie Lohse, treasurer; Geraldine Freeman, secretary; and Allen Swearinger, member at large.\n\nAndrew Freeman is at the center of the dispute, which began at the tribe\u2019s annual meeting on April 12 at Carlino\u2019s Event Center at Rolling Hills Casino in Corning, California.\n\nAccording to witness statements in a lawsuit filed in tribal court against Andrew Freeman by his cousin, council member Geraldine Freeman and Ines Crosby, a Paskenta tribal member and Chair of the Board of Directors for the Rolling Hills Health Clinic and Dental Lab, Freeman went off the agenda at the meeting and tried to order tribal members with lineage to the Henthorn/Pata Family, including Crosby and council member Lohse, to be removed from the meeting. Then he \u201cpurported\u201d to banish them from tribal lands, the lawsuit says, and the meeting descended into chaos.\n\n\u201cNone of the remaining Councilmembers were aware of the Chairman\u2019s unilateral proclamation, or understood the reasoning behind it; in shock, they objected,\u201d the lawsuit says. \u201cChairman Freeman did not honor the objection of the four Council members or otherwise call the meeting to order, and pandemonium ensued.\u201d\n\nAccording to a witness statement, security officers from the casino and law enforcement officers from the sheriff\u2019s office \u201cswarmed\u201d the place and took up positions behind the tribal council. \u201cI could see [the Tribal Council] were being surrounded by the crowd and it didn\u2019t look safe up there for anyone. The first three rows stood up and began yelling loudly,\u201d the witness said.\n\nEvents, as described in the lawsuit, then became murky. The tribal council and general council adjourned the meeting \u2013 local police reports say the meeting was adjourned by 10:48 a.m. But the plaintiffs claim the minutes of the meeting were falsified to say that during that same time period Freeman said the council members who had left the meeting had abandoned their positions on the tribal council and should be removed immediately. The general council approved his resolution to remove them \u201cby acclamation,\u201d the lawsuit says. Then new council members were nominated and approved \u201cby acclimation.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A leadership and disenrollment fight in the Paskenta Band of Nomlaki Indians of California has spiral out of control even with BIA involvement.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/06/13/epic-paskenta-dispute-continues-despite-bia-cease-and-desist-letter-155285", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/armedguardspaskenta.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Epic Paskenta Dispute Continues, Despite BIA Cease and Desist Letter"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dc": {"title": "Epic Paskenta Dispute Continues, Despite BIA Cease and Desist Letter"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/06/13/epic-paskenta-dispute-continues-despite-bia-cease-and-desist-letter-155285", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.creator": "kpolisse", "dcterms.date": "2014-06-13T14:00-04:00", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Paskenta Band of Nomlaki Indians of California, Disenrollment, Rolling Hills Casino, Bureau of Indian Affairs, BIA, Andrew Freeman, Troy Burdick, Armed Guards, Illegal Operation", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 1}, "dcterms.title": "Epic Paskenta Dispute Continues, Despite BIA Cease and Desist Letter"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfbbc\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI could see [the Tribal Council] were being surrounded by the crowd and it didn\u2019t look safe up there for anyone.\nThe tribal council and general council adjourned the meeting \u2013 local police reports say the meeting was adjourned by 10:48 a.m.\nThen new council members were nominated and approved \u201cby acclimation.\u201d\nBut the BIA\u2019s intervention did not end the dispute: an appeal of the cease and desist order was filed almost immediately and the conflict continues.\nBurdick said the BIA recognizes the last elected tribal council of Andrew Freeman, chairman; David Swearinger, vice chairman; Leslie Lohse, treasurer; Geraldine Freeman, secretary; and Allen Swearinger, member at large."}
