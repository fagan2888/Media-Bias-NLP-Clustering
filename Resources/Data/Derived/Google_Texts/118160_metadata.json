This scenario sounds creepy, with its undertones of Big Brother and eugenics; framed this way, it would be neither a realistic nor a desirable development.\n\nBut this thought experiment, provoked by a new book by Brookings Institution scholar Isabel Sawhill, illuminates two important societal and technological realities.\n\nFirst, as Sawhill describes in \u201cGeneration Unbound: Drifting into Sex and Parenthood Without Marriage,\u201d single parenthood is becoming the unhealthy \u201cnew normal.\u201d Once, single parenthood was the consequence of divorce or the province of the poorest and least educated.\n\nNow, divorce rates are edging down. The prevalence of single parenting is largely a function of the never-married. The average woman today has her first baby before she is married. Meanwhile, single parenthood is invading the ranks of the middle class, often involving children with multiple partners.\n\nThe stereotypical single mother used to be a high school dropout. No more. In 2010, Sawhill notes, 58 percent of first births to those with high school diplomas or some college were out of wedlock. (The comparable figure for those with a college degree was just 12 percent.)\n\nThe paradox of the growing rate of single parenthood is that teenage pregnancy and birth rates have plummeted since the 1990s. But 20-somethings are the new teens: Unwanted pregnancies soared in this cohort during that same period. Among single women under 30, about 70 percent of pregnancies are unplanned; just under half of these pregnancies are carried to term.\n\nThe resulting children are the product of unstable relationships. In one study of 5,000 newborns in large and midsize U.S. cities, half the parents were living together at the time of birth; another third were dating. But by the time the children were age 5, only one-third of those couples were still together \u2014 compared with 80 percent of their married counterparts.\n\nMore disturbing, many of those single mothers went on to have additional children with other partners, introducing new layers of instability into their children\u2019s already complicated lives.\n\nCertainly, single parents can be dedicated and capable caregivers. Yet the broader trend toward single parenthood is undeniably bad for the children involved. If marriage rates returned to their level in 1970, according to Sawhill\u2019s calculations, the rate of child poverty would be about 20 percent lower.\n\nStill, there is no reversing the inexorable trend against marriage. This acceptance reflects a shift for Sawhill, who just a couple of years ago was asserting that \u201cDan Quayle was right\u201d when he criticized television character Murphy Brown for choosing unwed motherhood. Marriage, Sawhill argued then, should be celebrated as \u201cthe best environment for raising children.\u201d\n\nShe still thinks so. \u201cMarriage is beneficial,\u201d Sawhill writes. \u201cBut when marriage has virtually collapsed among so many members of the youngest generation, the fact that it is still alive and well for the elites does not leave much room for optimism.\u201d\n\nConsequently, the more effective argument to sexually active 20-somethings is not to hurry up marriage \u2014 it\u2019s to slow down the decision to have a child.\n\nWhich leads to the second point: There is a relatively easy and inexpensive (compared with child-bearing) technological solution at hand.\n\nThe most popular contraceptive methods have high failure rates, due more to misuse (or non-use) than to product shortcomings. Thus, 18 percent of condom users and 9 percent of those who take birth control pills will become unintentionally pregnant in the course of a year.\n\nThe smarter alternative is encouraging young women to switch to LARCs \u2014 long-acting reversible contraceptives such as IUDs, which can remain in place for as long as 12 years, or implantable birth-control, which can last for three years.\n\nThe insights of behavioral economics are at work here: To achieve the desired outcome, switch the default, from having to take active steps to prevent pregnancy to having to take action to achieve it. These methods, Sawhill writes, \u201care forgiving of human frailty.\u201d\n\nGovernment can\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t force young women to use LARCs. It can \u2014 thank you, Affordable Care Act \u2014 make them readily and affordably available. Turning drifters into planners, in Sawhill\u2019s phrase, would not only be far better for Generation Unbound. It would give their wanted children the opportunity they deserve.\n\nRead more from Ruth Marcus\u2019s archive, follow her on Twitter or subscribe to her updates on Facebook.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Long-acting birth control could curb pregnancies for young single women.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/ruthmarcus", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Long-acting birth control could curb pregnancies for young single women.", "title": "Long-acting birth control could help stabilize the single parenthood trend", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/ruth-marcus-long-acting-birth-control-could-help-stabilize-generation-unbound/2014/09/23/01ba1c68-4355-11e4-b47c-f5889e061e5f_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/07/07/Interactivity/Images/crop_358Health_Overhaul_Free_Birth_Control_-0cde5.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@RuthMarcus"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/ruth-marcus-long-acting-birth-control-could-help-stabilize-generation-unbound/2014/09/23/01ba1c68-4355-11e4-b47c-f5889e061e5f_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Ruth Marcus, teenage pregnancy, single mothers, single motherhood, marriage, marriage decline, birth control, contraception, single parenting", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/ruthmarcus"}, "eomportal-uuid": "01ba1c68-4355-11e4-b47c-f5889e061e5f", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Ruth Marcus, teenage pregnancy, single mothers, single motherhood, marriage, marriage decline, birth control, contraception, single parenting"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2031\"", "article_summary": "First, as Sawhill describes in \u201cGeneration Unbound: Drifting into Sex and Parenthood Without Marriage,\u201d single parenthood is becoming the unhealthy \u201cnew normal.\u201d Once, single parenthood was the consequence of divorce or the province of the poorest and least educated.\nThe paradox of the growing rate of single parenthood is that teenage pregnancy and birth rates have plummeted since the 1990s.\nMeanwhile, single parenthood is invading the ranks of the middle class, often involving children with multiple partners.\nYet the broader trend toward single parenthood is undeniably bad for the children involved.\nMarriage, Sawhill argued then, should be celebrated as \u201cthe best environment for raising children.\u201dShe still thinks so."}
