Obama\u2019s remarks are scheduled for the meeting\u2019s general session during the conference, which is set for Feb. 27 and 28.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThis is the first time Obama has spoken in person at a DNC meeting since 2010, DNC spokesman Michael Czin confirmed to The Hill.\n\nThat year, the Republican Party won a majority in the House, gaining more than 60 seats.\n\nAt the February 2010 winter meeting, Obama expressed his commitment to the healthcare reform law, which Congress passed a month later.\n\n\u201cLet me be clear: I am not going to walk away from health insurance reform. I'm not going to walk away from the American people. I'm not going to walk away on this challenge,\u201d Obama said. \u201c\"I'm not going to walk away on any challenge. We're moving forward. We are moving forward. Sometimes, we may be moving forward against the prevailing winds. Sometimes it may be against a blizzard! But we're going to live up to our responsibility to lead.\u201d\n\nThe Republican National Committee held its winter business meeting last month.\n\n--This post was updated at 11:45 a.m.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "This is the first time Obama has spoken in person at the Democratic meeting since 2010.", "description": "This is the first time Obama has spoken in person at the Democratic meeting since 2010.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Ballot Box"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "This is the first time Obama has spoken in person at the Democratic meeting since 2010.", "title": "Obama to address DNC winter meeting Feb. 28", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/other-races/198334-obama-to-address-dnc-winter-meeting-feb-28", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/obamabarack_012914getty_0.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-02-13T14:50:26-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2014-02-13T14:50-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/other-races/198334-obama-to-address-dnc-winter-meeting-feb-28", "dcterms.date": "2014-02-13T11:28-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Rebecca Shabad", "author": "Rebecca Shabad", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Barack Obama,DNC", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-13T11:28:55-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-13T14:50:26-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/other-races/198334-obama-to-address-dnc-winter-meeting-feb-28", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "This is the first time Obama has spoken in person at the Democratic meeting since 2010.", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama to address DNC winter meeting Feb. 28"}, "dcterms.title": "Obama to address DNC winter meeting Feb. 28"}, "article_summary": "President Obama will address the Democratic National Committee at its annual winter meeting on Feb. 28 in Washington, D.C.\nAt the February 2010 winter meeting, Obama expressed his commitment to the healthcare reform law, which Congress passed a month later.\nADVERTISEMENTThis is the first time Obama has spoken in person at a DNC meeting since 2010, DNC spokesman Michael Czin confirmed to The Hill.\nBut we're going to live up to our responsibility to lead.\u201dThe Republican National Committee held its winter business meeting last month.\nWe're moving forward."}
