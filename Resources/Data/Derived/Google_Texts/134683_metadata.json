The College\u2019s president Dr. Wayne J. Riley proudly proclaimed, \u201cThe LGBT community deserves the same high quality care that any community in the United States should be getting, but may not be getting,\u201d adding that the college\u2019s just-published policy position paper in the Annals of Internal Medicine is \u201cbased upon our longstanding policy in regard to eliminating healthcare disparities.\u201d\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nThe paper cites that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s (CDC) estimate that roughly 1.1 million people in the U.S. have contracted HIV, and one-sixth of those are undiagnosed. The ACP also states that lesbian and bisexual women don\u2019t get screened for breast or cervical cancer as much as heterosexual women.\n\nThe paper asserts that gender identity must be factored in non-discrimination and anti-harassment policies.\n\nRiley pontificated, \u201cThis speaks to the fact that the nation\u2019s largest specialty society comes down on the side of health equity for all.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising that the ACP endorsed the LGBT line; it vehemently opposed the Hobby Lobby decision, writing:\n\nThe American College of Physicians (ACP) is deeply concerned about the adverse impact on healthcare that may result from today\u2019s Supreme Court ruling that allows \u201cclosely held\u201d for-profit employers to opt-out of evidence-based contraceptive coverage requirements. We believe that this decision will make it more difficult for women to access affordable contraceptives, and potentially, open the door for for-profit employers to seek additional exemptions from other evidence-based coverage requirements established by the Affordable Care Act (ACA).\n\nThe ACP gushed in 2012 over ObamaCare: \u201cThe American College of Physicians (ACP), representing 132,000 internal medicine specialists and medical student members, is pleased to report that the Affordable Care Act (ACA) has resulted in major improvements in access and coverage for tens of millions of Americans seen by internal medicine physicians.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The American College of Physicians has parroted the LGBT line, calling for same-sex marriage and opposing therapy for homosexuals.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "The American College of Physicians has parroted the LGBT line, calling for same-sex marriage and opposing therapy for homosexuals.", "title": "American College of Physicians Endorses Same-Sex Marriage, Transgender Issues - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/03/rainbow-lgbt-flag-supreme-court-Reuters.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/05/11/american-college-of-physicians-endorses-same-sex-marriage-transgender-issues/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The American College of Physicians has parroted the LGBT line, calling for same-sex marriage and opposing therapy for homosexuals.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/03/rainbow-lgbt-flag-supreme-court-Reuters.jpg", "title": "American College of Physicians Endorses Same-Sex Marriage, Transgender Issues - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "American College of Physicians, CDC, gender identity, HIV, lgbt, obamacare, same-sex marriage, Transgender,Big Government, Marriage, Medicine,physicians", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "Transgender", "published_time": "2015-05-11T17:48:15-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,Marriage,Medicine"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe American College of Physicians (ACP), the largest group of internal medicine doctors in the country, has now parroted the LGBT supporters\u2019s line, calling for civil marriage rights for same-sex couples and opposing conversion or reparative therapy for homosexuals.\nThe College also champions health insurance plans covering comprehensive transgender healthcare services.\nThe ACP gushed in 2012 over ObamaCare: \u201cThe American College of Physicians (ACP), representing 132,000 internal medicine specialists and medical student members, is pleased to report that the Affordable Care Act (ACA) has resulted in major improvements in access and coverage for tens of millions of Americans seen by internal medicine physicians.\u201d\nThe ACP also states that lesbian and bisexual women don\u2019t get screened for breast or cervical cancer as much as heterosexual women.\nThe paper asserts that gender identity must be factored in non-discrimination and anti-harassment policies."}
