Both Republicans and Democrats \u2014 not to mention the White House itself \u2014 invite guests to attend the annual address, and it\u2019s not just as a favor to those invited. Special guests typically serve as symbols of issues of the day, and this year, faith is at the heart of some of the most contested ones. That\u2019s why many of the guests in the House gallery will represent various religious backgrounds \u2014 and the issues they bring with them. Here\u2019s who you can expect to see in the audience, and why they\u2019re so significant.\n\nKim Davis, county clerk from Rowan County, Kentucky\n\nAfter same-sex marriage became legal in all 50 states as a result of last year's historic Supreme Court ruling, Davis made news when she refused to issue marriage licenses to gay couples because she said it violated her religious beliefs. Her protest was at the center of a national debate on gay rights versus freedom of religion, and that fight is certainly not over. The Family Research Council, a social conservative, antigay activist group, has arranged for Davis and her lawyer to attend the address, though it\u2019s unclear which lawmaker is responsible for providing the seats. In a direct contrast to her presence, though, will be Jim Obergefell, the plaintiff in the Supreme Court case that nationalized gay marriage. He\u2019s a guest of the president.\n\nPhoto: Ty Wright/Getty Images\n\nDr. Mohammed Qureshi, Muslim doctor whose mosque was shot in a hate crime\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nQureshi is the president of Baitul Aman Mosque in Meriden, Connecticut, which was shot at shortly after the Nov. 13 Paris terrorist attacks. A local resident named Ted Hackey Jr. fired several rounds of bullets from his semi-automatic rifle in his yard -- aiming some in the direction of the mosque next door. His Facebook page featured hateful rants like \u201cAll Muslims must die!\u201d Qureshi, who is a guest of Rep. Joe Courtney, D-Conn., said he wished he had introduced himself to the mosque neighbor. \u201cIf he had known us, he wouldn\u2019t have had that hate.\u201d\n\nCatholic nuns Sister Loraine Marie Maguire and Sister Constance Veit\n\nMaguire and Veit have been invited by the House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., to represent the Little Sisters of the Poor, a Catholic religious order that has fought a long legal battle against the Affordable Care Act\u2019s contraceptive mandate. In a class-action lawsuit, the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty has argued on behalf of the nuns that religious exemptions in the ACA are not enough, because simply signing the coverage over to a third-party insurance provider makes them complicit in offering birth control. Maguire and Veit will sit in the Speaker\u2019s Box during the speech.\n\nPhoto: TIMOTHY A. CLARY/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAsima Silva, founder of \u2018Meet a Muslim Day\u2019\n\nAfter a spike in backlash against Muslim-Americans following the Paris and San Bernardino terrorist attacks, many activists have mobilized to increase awareness about Islam among their fellow Americans. Asima Silva is one of those activists. She founded EnjoinGood.org, an organization dedicated to help Muslims be more active in their communities through service. She also organized \u201cMeet A Muslim Day\u201d in Worcester, Massachusetts, in an attempt to build bridges between Muslim-Americans and their fellow citizens. Silva is a guest of Rep. James McGovern, D-Mass.\n\nPhoto: lex Wong/Getty Images\n\nVarious Muslim-Americans\n\nReps. Keith Ellison of Minnesota, a Muslim, and Debbie Wasserman-Schultz of Florida, a Jew, both Democrats, have urged their colleagues to invite Muslims to the speech in as a sign of opposition to anti-Muslim bigotry. According to an aide of Wasserman-Schultz, 20 members of Congress have pledged to bring Muslim guests to the event. Among them is Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., who is bringing Abdirahman Kahin, a prominent Muslim from the Twin Cities and a local restaurant owner. Other Muslims in attendance will include an imam from New Jersey and representatives from the Council on American-Islamic Relations.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://s2.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "state of the union guests, who are the state of the union guests, muslims state of the union, catholic nuns state of the union, kim davis state of the union", "og": {"site_name": "International Business Times", "description": "Religion and faith featured prominently for lawmakers choosing guests for Tuesday\u2019s State of the Union speech.", "title": "SOTU Guests: Muslims, Nuns And Kim Davis Underscore Role Of Religion At State Of The Union 2016", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/sotu-guests-muslims-nuns-kim-davis-underscore-role-religion-state-union-2016-2261735", "image": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2016/01/12/gettyimages-489825094_0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Religion and faith featured prominently for lawmakers choosing guests for Tuesday\u2019s State of the Union speech.", "title": "SOTU Guests: Muslims, Nuns And Kim Davis Underscore Role Of Religion At State Of The Union 2016", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/sotu-guests-muslims-nuns-kim-davis-underscore-role-religion-state-union-2016-2261735", "image": {"src": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2016/01/12/gettyimages-489825094_0.jpg", "identifier": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2016/01/12/gettyimages-489825094_0.jpg"}, "site": "@IBTimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "fb": {"app_id": 263851690471857, "pages": 128026713884051}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/IBTimes", "section": "Media & Culture", "published_time": "2016-01-12T13:42:37-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-12T14:37:24-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Religion and faith featured prominently for lawmakers choosing guests for Tuesday\u2019s State of the Union speech."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2fd3\"", "article_summary": "According to an aide of Wasserman-Schultz, 20 members of Congress have pledged to bring Muslim guests to the event.\nIn a direct contrast to her presence, though, will be Jim Obergefell, the plaintiff in the Supreme Court case that nationalized gay marriage.\nThat\u2019s why many of the guests in the House gallery will represent various religious backgrounds \u2014 and the issues they bring with them.\nOther Muslims in attendance will include an imam from New Jersey and representatives from the Council on American-Islamic Relations.\nIf you\u2019re a big supporter in the separation of church and state, you might want to skip President Barack Obama\u2019s final State of the Union address on Tuesday night."}
