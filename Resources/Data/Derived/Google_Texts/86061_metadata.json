I couldn\u2019t believe it when I lost.\u201d\n\nThat was bad, no doubt.\n\nBut Underwood\u2019s defeat in his 220-pound state final, 7-6, might have been the toughest of all. In the last second \u2014 perhaps in the last half-second \u2014 Underwood flipped his opponent for a takedown, which would have given him the points to seal the championship.\n\nBut the final horn sounded before Underwood\u2019s opponent hit the mat. The ref waved it off.\n\nUnderwood was a runner-up.\n\nAnd almost immediately, after the initial sting, he said he was more determined.\n\n\u201cI never wanted to have that feeling again,\u201d said Underwood, who has jumped up to the heavyweight division this year and stands 24-0. \u201cThat match changed me.\u201d\n\nFor Lewis, watching Underwood\u2019s loss just about doubled his pain because less than an hour earlier, he lost his 2A state final match at 126 pounds, 8-3.\n\n\u201cRight then I think we all became more determined,\u201d said Lewis, who is wrestling this year at 138 pounds and is 23-1. \u201cIt made us want it more. I want to be a state champion. We all want to be state champions.\u201d\n\nIn about a month at the Lakeland Center, it could happen.\n\nFor all three.\n\nIt\u2019s a mantra that Lewis, a sophomore, Mosco, a freshman (now at 195 with a 15-2 record), and Underwood, a senior, have reminded each other every day. It has boosted them. United them. Made them stronger.\n\n\u201cThey tutor each other, they give each other rides to school, they work out together,\u201d Jesuit coach Mike Scicchitano said. \u201cI know the word \u2018family\u2019 gets overused sometimes in sports, but the fact is these guys are there for each other. It\u2019s a special group.\u201d\n\nAll three inspire confidence in the rest of the Tigers, and all three made a point to thank the rest of their teammates.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tough to win a state title without a great group of teammates,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cIf any of us wins it\u2019s a victory for the whole team. That\u2019s how it feels.\u201d\n\nIt has rubbed off.\n\nOverall, Jesuit is having one of its best seasons in program history. The Tigers have won three tough tournaments and own a 21-4 dual-match record.\n\nAs for winning a state team title, it would be tough because juggernaut Brandon, a winner of 13 straight state team titles and 24 overall, is in Class 2A with the Tigers.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s OK,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cI like the challenge of having Brandon in there with us. We all do.\u201d\n\nScicchitano, meantime, keeps reminding them to keep perspective.\n\n\u201cThe state tournament matches come down to a few points that could go either way,\u201d Scicchitano said. \u201cAll I know is that we\u2019re all giving it everything we have. If we do that then we can be proud.\u201d\n\nIf one wins and the others don\u2019t?\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be happy for whoever wins,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cBut hopefully it will be all of us.\n\n\u201cThat would be awesome.\u201d\n\ntpurks@tampatrib.com\n\n(813) 259-7615\n\nTwitter: @TBO_PrepSports", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sun, 12 Jan 2014 22:03:08 -0400", "Description": "TAMPA \u2014 There are three wrestlers at Jesuit High \u2014 Adam Lewis, Nick Mosco and Austin Underwood \u2014 who shared the same frustration last year in the middle of the Lakeland Center fl", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "TAMPA \u2014 There are three wrestlers at Jesuit High \u2014 Adam Lewis, Nick Mosco and Austin Underwood \u2014 who shared the same frustration last year in the middle of the Lakeland Center fl", "title": "Jesuit wrestling team determined to find glory", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/sports/preps/jesuit-wrestling-team-determined-to-find-glory-20140112/", "image": {"width": 3096, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140112/ARTICLE/140119748/AR/0/AR-140119748.jpg", "height": 2063}, "updated_time": "2014-01-12T22:03:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "TAMPA \u2014 There are three wrestlers at Jesuit High \u2014 Adam Lewis, Nick Mosco and Austin Underwood \u2014 who shared the same frustration last year in the middle of the Lakeland Center", "title": "Jesuit wrestling team determined to find glory", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140112/ARTICLE/140119748/AR/0/AR-140119748.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "googlebot-news": "noindex", "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2014-01-12T22:03:08Z-04", "modified_time": "2014-01-12T22:03:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcedf0\"", "article_summary": "As for winning a state team title, it would be tough because juggernaut Brandon, a winner of 13 straight state team titles and 24 overall, is in Class 2A with the Tigers.\nThey each had made it to the state final match in their respective weight classes, fought mightily, only to lose by the slimmest of margins.\nBut Underwood\u2019s defeat in his 220-pound state final, 7-6, might have been the toughest of all.\n\u201cI\u2019ll be happy for whoever wins,\u201d Lewis said.\n\u201cRight then I think we all became more determined,\u201d said Lewis, who is wrestling this year at 138 pounds and is 23-1."}
