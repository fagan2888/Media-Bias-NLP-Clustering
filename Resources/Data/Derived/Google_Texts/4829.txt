SALVADOR, Brazil (AP) â€” Netherlands forward Memphis Depay looks set to play as an offensive wingback when the team faces Costa Rica on Saturday in the World Cup quarterfinals.

Depay, who has come off the bench to score twice in Brazil, will make his first start of the tournament.

Also, defender Daley Blind will move into midfield to replace the injured Nigel de Jong, and veteran Dirk Kuyt will again start in the defense, but this time he is expected to play on the right.

Costa Rica called up Johnny Acosta to replace defender Oscar Duarte, who was sent off in the second-round victory over Greece.
