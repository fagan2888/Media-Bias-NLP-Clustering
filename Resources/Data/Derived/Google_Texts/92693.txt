ASPEN — The 39th Aspen Gay Ski week kicked off Sunday and this year’s event promises to be an economic powerhouse.

Hotel room sales for the event have more than doubled from $300,000 in 2015 to $700,000 this year. Aspen Gay Ski Week chair Kevin McManamon said this year’s spike in sales comes largely in part due to the event’s first-time media sponsorship with the “gay epicenter of culture” television channel Logo TV.

The network will broadcast special events throughout Aspen Gay Ski Week, which runs Sunday through Jan. 24.Celebrity guests expected this week in Aspen include Meghan Trainor, Margaret Cho and Lance Bass.
