Defenders claimed it was just Abramowitz's salty way of talking after 30 years in the military. He was cleared of the allegation.\n\nDCF spokeswoman Alexis Lambert said Abramowitz had completed additional training recommended by the inspector general before stepping down.\n\nOne of the highest-profile cases during Abramowitz's tenure involved Don Spirit, a Gilchrist County man who murdered his daughter and six grandchildren before committing suicide almost exactly a year ago.\n\nAccording to the department, the family was involved in 18 child-protective investigations in the eight years preceding the murders. Spirit was involved in six of the investigations and was alleged to be the perpetrator in three of the cases.", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "The Florida Department of Children and Families lost one of its six regional managing directors Wednesday night, when David Abramowitz resigned from his", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/dcf-regional-leader-steps-down", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/healthnewsfl/files/styles/medium/public/201507/DCFLogo.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The Florida Department of Children and Families lost one of its six regional managing directors Wednesday night, when David Abramowitz resigned from his", "title": "DCF Regional Leader Steps Down"}, "org_id": 0, "twitter": {"site": "@HealthNewsFL", "card": "summary"}, "author": "News Service of Florida", "wordCount": 314, "dc": {"title": "DCF Regional Leader Steps Down"}, "nid": 11852, "datePublished": "2015-09-04", "story_id": 437466753, "keywords": "DCF, Florida Department of Children and Families", "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Carroll appointed longtime DCF employee Pattie Medlock as interim regional managing director.\n\"After almost 4 years as the DCF director, I have decided it is time to offer my resignation,\" Abramowitz, a retired Army colonel, emailed to department Secretary Mike Carroll.\nDCF spokeswoman Alexis Lambert said Abramowitz had completed additional training recommended by the inspector general before stepping down.\nSpirit was involved in six of the investigations and was alleged to be the perpetrator in three of the cases.\nAccording to the department, the family was involved in 18 child-protective investigations in the eight years preceding the murders."}
