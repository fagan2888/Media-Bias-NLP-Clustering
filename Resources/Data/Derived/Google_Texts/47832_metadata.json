More cases develop in many countries, then the world takes notice. Over thirty years later there is still no cure and it is still spreading rapidly in many places across the globe. This is the reality of HIV/AIDS and it\u2019s having a huge impact among teens.\n\nToday, over 1 million people in the United States are living with HIV, and in 2010 U.S. youth aged 13 to 24 accounted for 26% of all new HIV infections.\n\nIn fact, over 50% of youth with HIV in U.S. do not know they are infected. Part of the problem is that a great deal of youth don\u2019t think it\u2019s an issue for them.\n\nA 2012 survey of teens in U.S. by Kaiser Family Foundation found that most sexually active teens who have not been tested were not concerned about becoming infected with HIV.\n\nMany sexually active teens in U.S. don\u2019t get tested; only 22% of sexually active high school students have been tested for HIV in their lifetime.
