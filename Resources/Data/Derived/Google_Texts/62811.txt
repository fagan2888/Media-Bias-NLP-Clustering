Pro-choice propaganda artist Ron English is very controversial. His artwork, described as very disturbing, often focuses on abortion.

Recently Ron English uploaded a video depicting a baby Jesus doll hanging from a coat hanger with a sign saying: Hobby Lobby Aborted Baby Jesus.

It is unclear who orchestrated this vandalism or who produced the video. But Ron English just happened to go to the exact Hobby Lobby where these dolls were placed:

English writes on his blog, “While at Hobby Lobby in Poughkeepsie NY, Ron came across a rack which held four crucified aborted Baby Jesus’. Wonder if they are still there?”

The video shows the back of a person walking through a Hobby Lobby store on what appears to be around Easter.

The person then strategically places the coat hanger “aborted Jesus” through out the store.

The video entitled “Christian Consumerism” is almost certainly intended to make some sort of political statement, most likely in reference to Hobby Lobby’s pending lawsuit against the Obama Administration in opposition to Obamacare’s birth control mandate.

It ends with this cryptic message: “Consume like a real Christian at Hobby Lobby!

Ron English also mocked the pro-life billboard which features an African American child with the text: The MOST DANGEROUS place for an African American IS IN THE WOMB.”

The Ron English version read: “The MOST DANGEROUS place for an African American IS ON A BILLBOARD.”

In another piece of “art” produced by Ron English an archived and very disturbing video uploaded to the Ron English YouTube page, attempts to play into the fears that making abortion illegal will cause women to turn to coat hanger abortions and die.

The video: WARNING VERY GRAPHIC – depicts a naked woman standing in front of a Coat Hanger billboard giving herself a supposed “coat-hanger” abortion.

As she strips down in the video she simulates inserting a coat hanger into her vagina and at that point red paint simulating blood splatters on the billboard directly behind her.

I Haven’t seen the artwork showing the women killed by legal abortion yet- but- I am certain it is on the Ron English “to do ” list- NOT!
