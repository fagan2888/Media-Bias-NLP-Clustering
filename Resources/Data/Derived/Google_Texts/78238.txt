In the brief but already tortuous saga of Caesars v Blatstein and the fight over the Pier Shops, Bart Blatstein has filed to move the case against him to U.S. bankruptcy court in Camden because the Caesars parent company is in bankrutpcy (but in Illinois).

The case - in which Caesars Atlantic City president Kevin Ortzman accused Blatstein of being a rogue occupier of the Pier Shops and went so far as to ask a judge to halt a planned Blatstein press conference and eject Blatstein - was filed in Atlantic County Superior Court. Blatstein attorneys notified the county court by email late Friday and said they would file a formal notice of removal on Monday.

Blatstein, the noted reviver of Northern Liberties who has a summer home in Margate, wants to inject life into the failing luxury mall with entertainment and other kinds of venues. He paid $2.7 million to assume control over the lease from the Pier's prior operator, but Caesars now says that as owner of the Pier itself, they have the right to approve or disapprove of that transaction.

Blatstein says the casino company - which has been the subject of criticism from tenants of the Pier Shops, as well as former employees of Showboat, which they closed - was on board until Blatstein dropped off his blueprints. He accused Ortzman of wanting to steal his ideas for the Pier for themselves.
