Chris Christie's decision to eliminate state funding for family planning clinics during this time.\n\nIn its report, Women's Health at Risk, Planned Parenthood's advocacy arm said the cumulative impact of the original $7.5 million annual line-item cut in 2010 triggered the closure of six clinics and a reduction of office hours and services at 14 others.\n\nThat has meant fewer uninsured and low-income women \u2014 including teens, and minorities \u2014 have had access to health screenings and tests, as well as contraception, said Casey Olesko, spokeswoman for the Planned Parenthood Action Fund.\n\n\"The reality is that cuts to family planning services in New Jersey took away the health care that women relied on in our state \u2014 including cancer screenings, affordable birth control, and testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections including HIV/AIDS. This is playing politics with women's lives,\" Olesko said.\n\nIn 2009, the year before the $7.5 million grant funding was eliminated, there were 29,626 reported cases of syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia, the most common sexually transmitted bacterial infections, according to the report based on state health department data. By 2014, the most recent information available, 37,657 people had tested positive, a 27 percent increase.\n\nThe biggest annual spike, 18 percent, occurred in 2010. In July of that year, the state had eliminated the $7.5 million grant shared by 58 clinics, and by the end of the year, six clinics had closed.\n\nReported STD cases declined by 1 percent in 2011, but rose again in 2012, growing 2 percent and 4 percent every year through 2014, according to state data.\n\nThe spike in infections between 2009 and 2014 are higher than the state average in four of the five counties which lost clinics, the report said.\n\nInfections were up by 34 percent in Burlington County, which lost two clinics; 53 percent in Cumberland, where one clinic closed; 28 percent in Hudson County which lost one clinic; and 46 percent in Morris, also down one clinic.\n\nThe increase in infections climbed only 11 percent in Camden County, which lost a women's health center in Cherry Hill, according to the report.\n\nInfections jumped the highest, 70 percent, in Passaic County, where Planned Parenthood of Metropolitan New Jersey had stopped offering prenatal services in Paterson at the end of 2010 but remains open, according to the action fund's website.\n\nChristie said he eliminated the $7.5 million line item for the 58 women's health centers to help close an $11 billion budget gap in 2010. Cancer screenings and other services could be found elsewhere, such as federally qualified health clinics, his administration said.\n\nThe legislature repeatedly passed legislation restoring the money and Christie vetoed it each time.\n\nN.J. Democrats to revive effort to restore $7.5 million for women's health\n\nWhen the governor announced his candidacy for president last summer, he touted his multiple vetoes of the family planning funding as proof he was an authentic anti-abortion rights conservative that had taken on Planned Parenthood.\n\nSome but not all clinics were operated by Planned Parenthood. No clinic was allowed to use the state grant to pay for abortions.\n\n\"A small investment in family planning goes a long way, making these cuts even more devastating,\" according to the report. \"Every dollar invested in publicly funded family planning services saves over $7 in other public funding. These cost savings are due to prevented unintended pregnancies, including closely spaced and preterm births; and averted STIs including chlamydia, gonorrhea, pelvic inflammatory disease, and HIV and their complications.\"\n\nResponding to the report, the Christie administration offered examples of its commitment to women's health services. Chief among them is the governor's decision to expand the Medicaid program with federal funding through the Affordable Care Act. As a result, \"tens of thousands of women\" now have health care, state Health Department spokeswoman Donna Leusner said.\n\nMore women have gravitated to other health facilities during this time, Leusner said. In 2014, 241,993 women used community health centers, a 25 percent increase since 2009, Leusner said.\n\nA state and federally funded cancer screening program provided 18,000 women with mammograms in 2014, detecting 191 cases of breast cancer, Leusner said. The Cancer Education and Early Detection program also provided 9,200 pelvic exams that year, she added.\n\nThe budget Christie proposed earlier this month dedicates $4.1 million for the testing and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases, a $600,000 increase, Leusner said.\n\nSexually transmitted diseases are the most common forms of communicable diseases in New Jersey, according to state data.\n\nMark G. Martens, chairman of Jersey Shore University Medical Center's Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology in Neptune, said he thinks the loss of state funding and the clinics they supported is definitely a factor in the rise of sexually transmitted infections.\n\nBut it's not the only one, Martens said.\n\nThe rate of sexually transmitted diseases \"is going up nationally, and half the increase is from 15-to 24-year-olds,\" he said.\n\nAnd while Obamacare and Christie's \"fantastic decision\" to expand Medicaid is insuring many more people, access has been limited in two ways. It does not pay for pelvic exams for women under 21, based on federal guidelines aimed at avoiding unnecessary tests and expense, Martens said.\n\nObamacare also excludes immigrants, and the STD rate among Latinas is rising, he added.\n\nLatinas are nearly twice as likely to be uninsured than white women, according to the report.\n\n\"Better funding for clinics would help, and realizing that with the new pap smear guidelines, we should find a way to reach out\" to women and girls.\n\n\"With the rates of STDs going up, maybe (the governor) can help a little more,\" he said.\n\nSusan K.
