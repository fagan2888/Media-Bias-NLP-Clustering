Trainer Johnny Gonzales helps prediabetic patients lose weight at the gym he set up at the Lake County Tribal Health Clinic. ( Farida Jhabvala Romero/KQED )\n\nJohnny Gonzales kneels next to his client, Jorje Mendez, who is struggling through the last set of pushups at the gym.\n\n\u201cGive me eight of them!\u201d says Gonzales, 59. \u201cBe strict. This is where all the gains are made right here. If you can do this, you can do anything!\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a pretty typical gym in an atypical setting. Gonzales works with patients of the Lake County Tribal Health Clinic, and the gym is within the clinic itself.\n\nPatients diagnosed with prediabetes who enroll in a program to lose weight are eligible for work with Gonzales \u2014 free of charge.\n\nThe clinic, which targets members of the six local Pomo tribes in the county, also offers classes on healthy eating and other lifestyle changes that can reduce the risk of diabetes.\n\nMendez, 33, an accountant and father of five, was a cross-country champion at Clear Lake High during his younger days, but settled into a more sedentary lifestyle that involved \u201ceating a lot \u2014 and [drinking] a lot of alcohol.\u201d His weight ballooned to 300 pounds.\n\nHe decided to join the clinic\u2019s program after he was diagnosed as prediabetic. Grueling sessions with Gonzales three times a week have helped him lose over 45 pounds, he says.\n\n\u201cI feel better now,\u201d says Mendez. \u201cOther places you got to pay a fortune; I don\u2019t have that. So I\u2019m blessed to come here.\u201d\n\nAccess to this gym and Gonzales\u2019 training sessions are a game changer for patients like Mendez, who wouldn\u2019t be able to afford it otherwise. In Lake County, a quarter of the population lives below the federal poverty level, and the median household income of $36,548 is much lower than the statewide average.\n\nThe clinic\u2019s local efforts target a rapidly growing disease among Native Americans, who are twice as likely to be diagnosed with diabetes compared with non-Hispanic whites, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Indian Health Service. Particularly alarming is the impact of the disease among Native young people ages 10 to 19. That population is nine times more likely to be diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes than non-Hispanic white children.\n\nGonzales, who has worked with the Lake County Tribal Health Consortium since 2002, says that reality requires immediate attention.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing it. We have kids that are 12 years old that weigh 240, 250. So they are candidates for diabetes,\u201d says Gonzales. \u201cWhen you see a 12-year-old kid that is prediabetic, that is pretty sad. A lot of it is lack of education to that kid, or their parents just don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nGonzales, a former Marine, says Native American communities in Lake County face challenges that make them susceptible to diabetes. He has witnessed how lack of physical activity and healthy foods can take a toll in people\u2019s bodies.\n\n\u201cA lot of aching and pains weren\u2019t due to injuries. It\u2019s because they were inactive,\u201d says Gonzales of clients living at Big Valley Rancheria, one of the local Pomo reservations. \u201cTheir challenge is trying to eat healthy. On this reservation and some of the other reservations, it\u2019s not the healthiest food.\u201d\n\nEven with those challenges, Gonzales remains evangelical about the healing powers of physical activity. It\u2019s a deep-seated belief stemming from his personal experience after he hurt his back while working as a welder. Doctors told him he couldn\u2019t do construction work anymore and recommended surgery. At the time, Gonzales balked at the procedure and chose instead to swim and exercise to strengthen his back.\n\n\u201cI noticed that when I was active I didn\u2019t hurt nearly as bad, but when I wasn\u2019t active I hurt all the time,\u201d says Gonzales. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to depend on meds all the time, so I had to be active. That\u2019s when I started pursuing becoming a trainer.\u201d\n\nGonzales tells his clients that physical activity and perseverance are great medicines to combat diabetes and other ills. That helps him stay optimistic while on his job, which includes leading exercise workshops at nearby reservations. Participants often crowd the training, he says, though at other times nobody shows up. That doesn\u2019t dampen his passion for the job.\n\n\u201cThings tend to move a little slow in native country. Sometimes we just have to take baby steps,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd as a provider, you can\u2019t give up or they give up themselves.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Tribal health clinic includes on-site gym and free training sessions for patients at high risk of developing diabetes.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Lake County Native Americans Learn Power of Exercise to Fight Diabetes\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2015\\/11\\/03\\/lake-county-native-americans-learn-power-of-exercise-to-fight-diabetes\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-11-03 08:34:37\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-11-03 10:59:20\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":102167,\"author_id\":\"8659\",\"author_name\":\"Farida Jhabvala Romero\",\"author_display_name\":\"Farida Jhabvala Romero\",\"tags\":[\"Diabetes\",\"Exercise\",\"Native American\",\"News\"],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2015\\/11\\/RS17289_IMG_9338.JPG-qut.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "Tribal health clinic includes on-site gym and free training sessions for patients at high risk of developing diabetes.", "title": "Lake County Native Americans Learn Power of Exercise to Fight Diabetes", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2015/11/03/lake-county-native-americans-learn-power-of-exercise-to-fight-diabetes/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2015/11/RS17292_IMG_9344.JPG-qut-1-400x267.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@faridajhabvala"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "diabetes,exercise,native american,news", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Gonzales works with patients of the Lake County Tribal Health Clinic, and the gym is within the clinic itself.\nTrainer Johnny Gonzales helps prediabetic patients lose weight at the gym he set up at the Lake County Tribal Health Clinic.\nGonzales, who has worked with the Lake County Tribal Health Consortium since 2002, says that reality requires immediate attention.\nIn Lake County, a quarter of the population lives below the federal poverty level, and the median household income of $36,548 is much lower than the statewide average.\nA lot of it is lack of education to that kid, or their parents just don\u2019t know.\u201dGonzales, a former Marine, says Native American communities in Lake County face challenges that make them susceptible to diabetes."}
