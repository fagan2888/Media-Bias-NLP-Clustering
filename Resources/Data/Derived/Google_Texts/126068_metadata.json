And it is also my right to encourage the establishment of a new coffee house in Sanford, one that isn't prone to ill-advised political escapades...\"\n\nAddison says that despite the incident, business has been booming at the coffee shop.\n\n\"Since this has happened, I have had so many people come in, it has boosted my business,\" she said.\n\nAddison's daughter filed a police complaint in the case, but authorities say no charges were filed.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=1;polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=5;cycle=1", "dcterms.created": "2015-02-07 21:24:00", "description": "Employees of a Sanford coffee shop say they were threatened by the former chairman of the state's Mining and Energy Commission after placing a sign in their window protesting the proposed storage of coal ash in Lee County.", "application-name": "WRAL.com", "dcterms.modified": "2015-02-08 00:58:20", "outbrain": {"ob_desc": "id_asset=14431639|asset_type=story"}, "twitter": {"description": "Employees of a Sanford coffee shop say they were threatened by the former chairman of the state's Mining and Energy Commission after placing a sign in their window protesting the proposed storage of coal ash in Lee County.", "title": "Coal ash sign causes controversy at Sanford coffee shop :: WRAL.com", "url": "http://www.wral.com/coal-ash-sign-causes-controversy-at-sanford-coffee-shop/14431639/", "image": "http://wwwcache.wral.com/asset/news/local/2015/02/07/14432092/14432092-1423362210-160x120.jpg", "site": "@wral", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#041E30", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "robots": "index,follow", "pinterest": "nohover", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/favicons/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"app_id": 334167666672300}, "author": "WRAL", "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-07T21:24:00-05:00"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "og": {"site_name": "WRAL.com", "description": "Employees of a Sanford coffee shop say they were threatened by the former chairman of the state's Mining and Energy Commission after placing a sign in their window protesting the proposed storage of coal ash in Lee County.", "title": "Coal ash sign causes controversy at Sanford coffee shop :: WRAL.com", "url": "http://www.wral.com/coal-ash-sign-causes-controversy-at-sanford-coffee-shop/14431639/", "image": "http://wwwcache.wral.com/asset/news/local/2015/02/07/14432092/man_copy-960x540.jpg", "type": "article"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msapplication-TileImage": "/favicons/mstile-144x144.png"}, "article_summary": "Josie Seeley, who works at the shop, said Womack came in and asked to speak to Kathy Addison, the owner.\nAccording to Seeley, Womack, a former Lee County commissioner, said he would discourage people from doing business at the coffee shop unless the sign was removed.\n\"He's not gonna bully me to do it, I mean, make me take the sign out of the window,\" Addison said.\nA response posted on Womack's Facebook page said, \"I sincerely believe it is the first amendment right of Kathy's Java Express to put silly signs up in their shop window.\nAnd it is also my right to encourage the establishment of a new coffee house in Sanford, one that isn't prone to ill-advised political escapades...\"Addison says that despite the incident, business has been booming at the coffee shop."}
