The disease is caused by an airborne bacteria, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), that typically attacks the lungs, but can also harm the brain, kidneys, and spine. For most of recent history, TB was successfully treated with antibiotics; but as antibiotic resistance spreads, some strains of TB bacteria may also develop resistance to drugs.\n\nFinding new pathways of treatment for drug-resistant TB (as well as any other antibiotic-resistant bacteria), then, is quite critical. \u201cWith the worldwide emergence of highly drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB), novel agents that have direct antimycobacterial effects or that enhance host immunity are urgently needed,\u201d the authors write in the paper. They note that their results showed that curcumin stimulates the immune system as \u201ca potent inducer of apoptosis \u2014 an effector mechanism used by macrophages to kill intracellular Mycobacterium tuberculosis .\u201d\n\nIn the study, the researchers used an in vitro (outside the body) model for cells infected with TB. They focused on curcumin\u2019s effect on human macrophages, which are a type of white blood cell that clears out any foreign substances, microbes, cancer cells, or cellular waste from the body as part of the immune system. The use of curcumin in the model boosted the macrophages\u2019 ability to clear out and kill the tuberculosis bacteria.\n\nCurcumin is a substance found in turmeric, a root that\u2019s in the ginger family and originally found in India. Curcumin is turmeric\u2019s most active ingredient and offers anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. For centuries, turmeric has been used in both food and traditional medicine; it\u2019s typically boiled down, baked, and ground into a yellow powder. Curcumin gives turmeric its yellow coloring, and as a separate entity from turmeric is often used as an herbal supplement, or added to cosmetics, spices, or food coloring.\n\nFor thousands of years, turmeric has been used to treat arthritis, stomach problems, and other health issues in traditional medicine and spiritual rituals \u2014 more as an herbal supplement than anything else, of course. In 2014, curcumin was shown to reduce post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, and another study found that curcumin also held potential to shrink cancer tumors or slow their growth. All in all, curcumin has been studied robustly over the years, but most of its health benefits have been played out in laboratory dishes and have yet to be transferred to animal or human trials.\n\nIn order to move their latest study forward and provide more conclusive evidence, the researchers hope to experiment in an animal model next. \u201cOur study has provided basic evidence that curcumin protects against Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection in human cells,\u201d Dr. Xiyuan Bai, lead author of the study, said in the statement. \u201cThe protective role of curcumin to fight drug-resistant tuberculosis still needs confirmation, but if validated, curcumin may become a novel treatment to modulate the host immune response to overcome drug-resistant tuberculosis.\u201d\n\nSource: Bai X, Oberley-Deegan R, Bai A, Ovrutsky A, Kinney W, Weaver M.
