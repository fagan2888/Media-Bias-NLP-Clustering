Now he\u2019s the hottest custom builder in town \u2014 around thirty homes a year that are centered around Berkeley\u2019s red-hot Tennyson Street, but reaching through Highlands and into areas like Washington Park, where potential buyers can\u2019t find anything like him.\n\nPagano is the Denver franchise partner for G.J. Gardner Homes \u2013 billed as the biggest builder nobody ever heard of: real custom and semi-custom homes with detailing and personal service, but at prices that lean more toward production scaled housing. Last year G.J. Gardner\u2019s output in just the seven-county metro area ranked it as the city\u2019s 14th largest builder \u2013 not counting what additional franchise partners are doing on estate-sized sites out in Elbert County, and in Northern Colorado (franchisees in Loveland and Fort Collins); as well as Colorado Springs, Cheyenne or Grand Junction.What Australian-founded G.J. Gardner has done in Colorado is re-create the custom building experience on a market-wide scale, at the time when consumers face a housing market totally dominated by national corporations that deliver a highly packaged product. \u201cThere are plenty of buyers out there for whom the corporate building experience just doesn\u2019t work,\u201d says Brook Swientisky, Colorado Division President of G.J. Gardner, building homes here for nine years.\n\nFor builders like Pagano, with good knowledge of local buyers and available home sites, that can mean triple-digit year-over-year growth from their first full year with the company, Swientisky notes. Part of that owes to the buying power and the more sophisticated purchasing, design and estimating systems that G.J. Gardner provides, as well as to what the marketing and branding can bring to a builder with limited bandwidth. Meanwhile, G.J. Gardner nurtures what its smaller builders are already doing well \u2013 talking to their customers, and working with local communities, often concerning smaller site opportunities that mega-builders won\u2019t touch.\n\nRight now, G.J. Gardner has opportunities waiting for builders with those credentials \u2013 good knowledge of untapped markets such as Boulder, Arapahoe or Summit Counties, and with a track record of making customers happy, while wanting more of them. The experience could be toward luxury-custom homes (Boulder and Summit Counties, areas of Centennial and Greenwood Village); or toward production-scale enclaves (eastern Denver, Aurora) where there\u2019s a substantial market now for low-maintenance homes, for infill sites.\n\nThe place to begin exploring a move to G.J. Gardner is at GJGardner.com/franchising, followed up by a call to Brook Swientisky and his team. Meanwhile, in a market where buyers are getting less and less value for the dollar from resale homes, G.J. Gardner offers one-of-a-kind situations that match needs that large builders aren\u2019t delivering: New homes in mature urban neighborhoods, patio ranch homes, semi-custom homes, and homes designed for acreage lots.
