As specialist organizations consider offering integrated primary care/behavioral health services, whether to work with or compete with FQHCs or one of the many FQHC-like organizations, is a big question. To answer that question, understanding the FQHC landscape is essential.\n\nFQHCs are public, non-profit, community-based provider organizations that receive grant funding under the Health Center Consolidation Act (Section 330 of the Public Health Service Act). FQHCs are required to provide a comprehensive array of services including primary and preventative care; additionally FQHCs must provide or contract with other organizations to provide dental care, hospital care, transportation services \u2013 and mental health and substance abuse services.\n\nToday, there are nearly 1,300 FQHCs at over 9,100 service sites, which serve approximately 21.7 million consumers. In addition to section 330 grant funding, FQHCs are reimbursed by Medicaid through a prospective payment system (PPS) or other state-approved alternative payment system, and, as of 2014, FQHCs are also reimbursed for Medicare through a bundled rate via a prospective payment system (PPS) (see Medicare Moving FQHC Reimbursement From FFS To Bundled Rates). Additionally, FQHCs can charge consumers an out-of-pocket fee for services based on a sliding scale fee.\n\nWhile all FQHCs must meet certain requirements, there are different types of health centers. While there are no federal licensure categories for the types of FQHCs, there are different designations based on the types of populations that each center focuses on serving. These types include:\n\nCommunity Health Centers (CHCs) \u2013 Provide preventive medical care services to several federally designated Medically Underserved Area/Populations (MUA or MUP). In 2013, there were 703 CHCs across the U.S.\n\n\u2013 Provide preventive medical care services to several federally designated Medically Underserved Area/Populations (MUA or MUP). In 2013, there were 703 CHCs across the U.S. Migrant Health Centers \u2013 Provide preventive medical care services to migrant and seasonal workers. In 2013, there were 169 migrant health centers across the U.S.\n\n\u2013 Provide preventive medical care services to migrant and seasonal workers. In 2013, there were 169 migrant health centers across the U.S. Health Care for the Homeless Programs \u2013 Provide preventive care and substance abuse services to homeless individuals or families. In 2013, there were 250 health care for the homeless programs across the U.S.\n\n\u2013 Provide preventive care and substance abuse services to homeless individuals or families. In 2013, there were 250 health care for the homeless programs across the U.S. Public Housing Primary Care Programs (PHPC) \u2013 Provide preventive medical care services to residents of public housing. In 2013, there were 80 PHPC programs across the U.S.\n\nIn addition to these four types of FQHCs, there are two other types of federally supported health clinics that do not receive Section 330 grants \u2013 Rural Health Clinics and FQHC Look-Alikes.\n\nThe question is, what will FQHCs look like in the future? The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) allocated an additional $11 billion to FQHCs over a period of five years and that funding runs out in fiscal year 2016. On one hand, since Medicaid expansion and the opening of health insurance marketplaces in 2014, there should be fewer uninsured consumers to serve. On the other, this expansion increases the demand for primary care services \u2013 and will increase the number of economically disadvantaged beneficiaries looking for services.\n\nTo learn more about FQHCs, including details about funding, check out What Are The Types Of Federal Health Centers?: An OPEN MINDS Market Intelligence Report.
