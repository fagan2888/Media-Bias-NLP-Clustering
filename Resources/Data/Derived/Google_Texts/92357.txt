MONTGOMERY, Alabama — Nearly 200,000 uninsured Alabamians are eligible for federal subsidies to help purchase insurance under the Affordable Care Act, according to a new report released today by the Kaiser Family Foundation.

The number represents 30 percent of Alabama’s uninsured population.

But 25 percent of the state’s uninsured population aren’t eligible for the subsidies to help buy insurance. And another 29 percent,or 191,000 people, fall in the coverage gap because the state is not participating in an optional expansion of Medicaid.

“The ACA will help many currently uninsured Alabamians gain health coverage, but many who could have obtained financial assistance through the Medicaid expansion will remain outside its reach,” the report stated.

“Further, the impact of the ACA will depend on take-up of coverage among the eligible uninsured, and outreach and enrollment efforts will be an important factor in determining how the law affects the uninsured rate in the state.”

The Affordable Care Act provides subsidies to people, from 100 to 400 percent of the federal poverty level, to help purchase insurance.

The report estimated Alabama’s uninsured population at 660,000.

However, only about 3,400 Alabamians signed up for insurance through the federal marketplace in the first two months.

Alabama had 2,824 people enroll in November and 624 in October.

Healthcare.gov, the federal enrollment portal, had a disastrous debut in October with frequent system crashes. Federal officials say many of the early issues have been resolved.
