A game warden in northern Kansas is asking the public for help to find anyone connected to the shooting death of seven American white pelicans.

Jewell County game warden Mike Peterson says he found the federally protected birds shot to death in Lovewell Reservoir on Friday.

Peterson believes the birds were all killed at the same time. The pelicans are currently migrating through the reservoir, which is along the Nebraska border.

The pelicans are protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, and those who shot the birds could be subject to fines.

Anyone with information is asked to contact the Jewell county game warden at (620) 450-7190 or call Operation Game Thief at (877) 426-3843.

KAKE news spoke with District Wildlife Biologist with Kansas Wildlife, Parks and Tourism in Wichita, Charlie Cope. Cope says, "It makes me mad because one, those folks aren't hunters. They're obviously poachers doing something that's illegal. And it's just disgusting."

Cope says, "You're not going to mistake them for anything else, especially this time of year when there's no goose season on or snow geese. There's nothing else that looks like them. And so it was intentional."
