An explosion and fire in a free-standing building that housed empty mail and laundry rooms at an apartment complex in southeast Denver forced some evacuations Sunday morning.

No one was injured in the fire at the French Quarter at Nine Mile Station, 3235 South Parker Road.

The fire was reported at about 7 a.m., said Mark Watson, a spokesperson for the Denver Fire Department. The free-standing, gazebo-like building was no longer in use.

“It has been moved so it wasn’t occupied,” Watson said.

Buildings adjacent to the one that exploded were evacuated.

Investigators have determined that no buildings were structurally damaged.

About 12 units were evacuated, and residents were allowed to return to their homes Sunday afternoon.

The department is investigating, Watson said.

Xcel Energy and the Denver Police Department were on the scene as well.
