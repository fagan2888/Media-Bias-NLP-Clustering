The community is fundraising to keep Sandy Meekins' children on a \"steady road\".\n\n\"Her son was involved in travel ball, basketball, football,\" Samantha Gordon, a friend of Meekins, said. \"Everybody knows her as our dugout mom. The boys would get out of line. You know, she'd take care of it. Just a great person. It's just hard when you get to talking.\"\n\nFamily and friends of Meekins are still grappling with her tragic death. Last Saturday, Tracey Brunson allegedly shot and killed the 44-year-old at her home with her two children and a cousin inside. He then turned the gun on himself.\n\n\"How are they dealing with all of this? 'They're being strong. They have a lot of people around them. That's what we're trying to do, just keep them close,'\" Gordon said.\n\nA lot of people have banded together to hold a pulled pork lunch plate fundraiser.\n\n\"Everyone sees a bright future in both of the kids and we wanna be there for them and this is just to help them stay on a steady road. That's what we want this to go for,\" Gordon explained.\n\nThe fundraiser will be held from 11-1 at the Graceville Civic Center and Gordon says this is just the beginning.\n\n\"We want to keep something every year. We have had several ball teams that have reached out. You know, talking about softball tournaments, baseball tournaments, and that's something we would like to continue in the years to come,\" Gordon explained.\n\nMeekins funeral will be held Saturday. Gordon says the Graceville Pee-Wee Association, who organized the fundraiser, also helped raise money for the funeral.\n\nIn regards to the shooting, local law enforcement are planning to turn the case over the State Attorney's office.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The community is fundraising Sunday to help keep Sandy Meekins' children on a 'steady road'.", "language": "english", "author": "Brian Hill", "og": {"url": "http://www.wjhg.com/home/headlines/Fundraiser-set-for-children-of-slain-parents--356230161.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/534*315/meek1.JPG", "type": "article", "description": "The community is fundraising Sunday to help keep Sandy Meekins' children on a 'steady road'.", "title": "Fundraiser set for children of slain parents"}, "twitter": {"description": "The community is fundraising Sunday to help keep Sandy Meekins' children on a 'steady road'.", "title": "Fundraiser set for children of slain parents", "url": "http://www.wjhg.com/home/headlines/Fundraiser-set-for-children-of-slain-parents--356230161.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/534*315/meek1.JPG", "creator": "@WJHG_TV", "site": "@WJHG_TV", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Fundraiser set for children of slain parents", "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "orfdzs_E4bRXom1qluA34zerrmjsg4QfrlLSkrR3ZAQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Fundraiser set for children of"}, "article_summary": "The community is fundraising to keep Sandy Meekins' children on a \"steady road\".\nThe Graceville community is stepping in to help the children of a woman gunned down last week.\nGordon says the Graceville Pee-Wee Association, who organized the fundraiser, also helped raise money for the funeral.\nThe fundraiser will be held from 11-1 at the Graceville Civic Center and Gordon says this is just the beginning.\nLast Saturday, Tracey Brunson allegedly shot and killed the 44-year-old at her home with her two children and a cousin inside."}
