But Hannity\u2019s not too disturbed to stoop to sleazy, unfounded rumors about Bill Clinton to use against Hillary Clinton.\n\nEarlier this week, Hannity all but declared newsly-announced Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz a conservative martyr.\n\nHANNITY: It didn\u2019t take long for the mainstream, liberal media and those on the left to attack him on everything from his stance on climate change to his latest announcement that he may be signing up for ObamaCare. \u2026This is the same group of people\u2026 that kissed Obama\u2019s backsides. I mean, sucked up big time.\n\nOh, how dare they!\n\nUnfortunately for Hannity, even his own, all-conservative panel didn\u2019t exactly show a lot of love for Cruz.\n\nGuest Bernard McGuirk said Cruz \u201ccomes off as a little bit smarmy, and a dilettante and he\u2019s a grandstanding narcissist.\u201d However, McGuirk also said he\u2019s \u201csmart, he\u2019s good on his feet and anybody who can raise the ire of these angry wackadoos had something going on, good for him.\u201d\n\nGuest Jedediah Bila sounded a lot more pro-Rand Paul than pro-Cruz. But she could appreciate the victimhood. \u201cBe prepared for this,\u201d she warned. Paul, Scott Walker, and Marco Rubio are also \u201cguys that the media is going to go after \u2018cause these are the ones that they\u2019re afraid of. So they\u2019re going to have to paint you as psychotic, they\u2019re going to have to paint you as every possible thing.\u201d\n\nBut painting Hillary Clinton as the wife of a pedophile or pedophile pal is A-OK for this crew. Before the segment was out, Hannity went after Bill Clinton with the unsubstantiated smear that even Bill O\u2019Reilly shot down:\n\nHANNITY: So they have this big story about Jeffrey Epstein, convicted pedophile guy, friend of Clinton. Clinton flies to Orgy Island, young girls, sex \u2013 can you imagine any of these Republican candidates having that background, hanging out with this guy, taking money for his foundation and getting the pass that the Clintons are getting?\n\nHannity later announced that according to Roger Stone (a Hillary-hating dirty trickster), Epstein gave money to the Clinton Foundation \u201cafter even he got in trouble with the young girl thing.\u201d As if that indicated some kind of bond of perversion.\n\nWhat Hannity didn\u2019t say is that there is no evidence tying Clinton to Epstein\u2019s sexcapades. BuzzFeed did an exhaustive investigation into the issue and, as the title of its article indicates, found \u201cPlenty Of Innuendo, But No Hard Evidence Of New Clinton Sex Scandal.\u201d BuzzFeed reports that flight logs indicate Clinton flew on Epstein's jet for professional reasons and \u201cnever flew with his wealthy friend anywhere near\u201d the so-called \u201cOrgy Island.\u201d It\u2019s Virginia Roberts, Epstein's alleged \"sex slave\" who is writing a \u201ctell-all memoir,\u201d who claims Clinton traveled there in 2002. Even so, she has said, \u201cI have never seen him have sexual relations with anyone.\u201d\n\nBut instead of challenging Hannity, the panel piled on. Guest Tom Shillue \u201casked,\u201d \u201cWas it called The Orgy Island before they went to it? I think that would have been a tip-off.\u201d\n\nThat got big laughs from guest Bernard McGuirk. McGuirk also complained that conservatives would not get this \u201cpass\u201d that Clinton is getting.\n\nBefore long, the gang was sneering about Hillary Clinton\u2019s lack of charisma.\n\nBut speaking of getting passes for hanging around with creeps and crooks, Hannity has some \u2018splaining to do about his own behavior. Like how he promoted racist criminal Cliven Bundy\u2019s armed insurrection against the U.S. government, or the radio airtime he gave to white supremacist Hal Turner, or when he cozied up to anti-Semite Mel Gibson while shutting Jewish Alan Colmes, Hannity's then-cohost, out of the interview.\n\nApparently, Hannity thinks his viewers are too stupid to notice that he does the very things for which he points fingers at others. The sad thing is, he may be right.\n\nWatch the hypocrisy below, from the March 25 Hannity show.", "article_metadata": {"csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "google-site-verification": "google51c0b549f514d464.html", "csrf-token": "yf9X02p5BGxIh31x9oZB4d/jzeg9x63tAr2JG1vwL50=", "og": {"url": "http://www.newshounds.us/hannity_complains_about_media_attacks_on_ted_cruz_then_smears_bill_clinton_with_sleazy_rumors_032815", "site_name": "NewsHounds", "image": "http://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/newshounds/sites/1/meta_images/original/Newshound3_blue.png?1327001871", "type": "article", "title": "Hannity Complains About Media Attacks On Ted Cruz \u2013 Then Smears Bill Clinton With Sleazy Rumors"}, "Title": "Hannity Complains About Media Attacks On Ted Cruz \u2013 Then Smears Bill Clinton With Sleazy Rumors"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5fb6\"", "article_summary": "But Hannity\u2019s not too disturbed to stoop to sleazy, unfounded rumors about Bill Clinton to use against Hillary Clinton.\nGuest Tom Shillue \u201casked,\u201d \u201cWas it called The Orgy Island before they went to it?\nEarlier this week, Hannity all but declared newsly-announced Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz a conservative martyr.\nUnfortunately for Hannity, even his own, all-conservative panel didn\u2019t exactly show a lot of love for Cruz.\nSo they\u2019re going to have to paint you as psychotic, they\u2019re going to have to paint you as every possible thing.\u201dBut painting Hillary Clinton as the wife of a pedophile or pedophile pal is A-OK for this crew."}
