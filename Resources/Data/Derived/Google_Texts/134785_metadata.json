How the case will ultimately turn out is far from clear.\n\nBut as Georgetown Law School\u2019s Marty Lederman points out in a new post at Balkanization, the hitch is not in the law, but in Little Sisters\u2019 case itself.\n\nLittle Sisters of the Poor, an order of nuns that operates nursing homes for the poor, is, like other religious non-profits, subject to the accommodation that the administration crafted last year in response to objections that religious non-profits, like houses of worship, should be fully exempt from the rule. The accommodation requires them to self-certify as objecting religious organizations, thus placing the onus on their insurance plan\u2019s third-party administrator to offer the coverage separately to employees. Objecting non-profits claim this arrangement still makes them complicit in providing the coverage they consider sinful, in that the self-certification would \u201cauthorize\u201d and \u201cdirect\u201d the coverage through the third-party administrator.\n\nBut Lederman, who last month pointed out a potential pitfall in the cases of the for-profit companies that will be heard by the Court later this term, is out with a new post suggesting a big hole in the Little Sisters\u2019 case as well. In short, the Little Sisters\u2019 argument that their self-certification would \u201cauthorize\u201d and \u201cdirect\u201d the third-party administrator to provide the coverage, thereby making them complicit, falls flat, since it is the government, not the plaintiffs, who is authorizing and directing the third-party administrator to take the action. (As Lederman notes, this argument also applies to the University of Notre Dame, which has raised similar objections in a case pending in the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.)\n\nBut the particularities of Little Sisters\u2019 insurance arrangement, Lederman argues, make its case even less compelling than Notre Dame\u2019s, because its insurer is not even required to provide the coverage at all, even if Little Sisters were to set the process in motion by self-certification. Little Sisters\u2019 coverage comes through a \u201cchurch plan,\u201d issued by Christian Brothers Trust. Under federal law, even if their insured organizations fill out the forms that would otherwise require the third-party administrator to arrange for the coverage, \u201cchurch plans\u201d are not required to provide it.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Justice Sotomayor's accommodation for the Catholic group isn't the victory for religious freedom the right insists", "title": "Little Sisters of the Poor vs. the contraception mandate", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Justice Sotomayor's accommodation for the Catholic group isn't the victory for religious freedom the right insists", "title": "Little Sisters of the Poor vs. the contraception mandate", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/01/12/little_sisters_of_the_poor_vs_the_contraception_mandate/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2012/10/birth-control-pills-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Justice Sotomayor's accommodation for the Catholic group isn't the victory for religious freedom the right insists", "title": "Little Sisters of the Poor vs. the contraception mandate", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2012/10/birth-control-pills-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sarah Posner", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Birth Control, Catholicism, contraception mandate, Little Sisters, Religion Dispatches, Sonia Sotomayor, Supreme Court", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Little Sisters\u2019 coverage comes through a \u201cchurch plan,\u201d issued by Christian Brothers Trust.\nBut as Georgetown Law School\u2019s Marty Lederman points out in a new post at Balkanization, the hitch is not in the law, but in Little Sisters\u2019 case itself.\nLittle Sisters of the Poor, an order of nuns that operates nursing homes for the poor, is, like other religious non-profits, subject to the accommodation that the administration crafted last year in response to objections that religious non-profits, like houses of worship, should be fully exempt from the rule.\nBut the particularities of Little Sisters\u2019 insurance arrangement, Lederman argues, make its case even less compelling than Notre Dame\u2019s, because its insurer is not even required to provide the coverage at all, even if Little Sisters were to set the process in motion by self-certification.\nThe accommodation requires them to self-certify as objecting religious organizations, thus placing the onus on their insurance plan\u2019s third-party administrator to offer the coverage separately to employees."}
