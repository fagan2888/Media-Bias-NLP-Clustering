That\u2019s not a big surprise. After all, it takes years, if not decades, for even a fast-growing company to achieve the earnings, sales and size of a large cap within the U.S. equity market. IBD defines a large cap for this screen as $15 billion in market value or higher.\n\nThe surprise found within the Big Cap 20 lies in how numerous companies have come back from truly severe declines.\n\nIBD teaches that only one out of eight big winners in the previous bull market cycle comes back to lead a future bull run.\n\nThose are not great odds for a former market leader. But Cognizant Solutions (CTSH), Gilead Sciences (GILD), UnitedHealth (UNH) and Analog Devices (ADI) have beaten the odds.\n\nA 70% Plunge\n\nAs taught in IBD\u2019s beginning-level live workshops, the average decline of a former big market winner from its ultimate peak price is 72%. In other words, a stock that tops out at 60 has the potential to bottom out near 17.\n\nIt\u2019s tough for any stock to dig itself out of that kind of hole.\n\nYet that\u2019s exactly what Cognizant did after the 2008-09 bear market ended.\n\nThe global player in information technology services fell 70% from its peak in February 2007 to a low of 7.19 (adjusted for splits) by November 2008. It looked like the stock\u2019s long run was over.\n\nNo it wasn\u2019t. Cognizant rebounded after the market\u2019s follow-through rally on March 12, 2009.\n\nIn July that year, the stock cleared a properly formed flat base near its 52-week high and eventually took out its 2007 peak. The stock corrected again from 2011 to the summer of 2013, then broke out again at 38.14 in the week ended Sept. 6, 2013. Another long digestion of gains led to a fresh breakout past a new 51.48 buy point last year.\n\nWhy did Cognizant come back strong? Steady earnings growth (from 95 cents a share in 2009 to $2.60 in 2014) is a big factor.\n\nWhile revenue growth is nowhere close to its days of 50% to 60% increases in 2006-07, it\u2019s still in the double-digit range.\n\nThose are impressive fundamentals for a company that broke the $10 billion revenue barrier last year.\n\nGilead had a monster run in the 2000s before peaking in August 2008. It then fell 45% from that peak. A large drop, surely, but nowhere near the typical 72% correction. New products, including its blockbuster drugs for Hepatitis C, have brought the institutional crowd back to the stock.\n\nObamaCare has helped catalyze new top- and bottom-line growth for UnitedHealth. Chipmaker Analog, meanwhile, is cashing in on the global phenomenon of Internet-enabled mobile devices.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The current list of IBD Big Cap 20 features more stocks that are relatively old than relatively new.
