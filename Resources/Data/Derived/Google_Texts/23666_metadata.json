The day of service was one of their nods to Native American Heritage Month, reports the Grand Valley Lanthorn, a student-run publication.\n\nThe clean up focused on the Norton Mounds, located just a few miles south of Grand Rapids, Michigan, one of the remaining Hopewell Mounds, which the Grand Rapids Public Museum is working to preserve.\n\nThe day of service was run by the university\u2019s Office of Multicultural Affairs and it began with an introduction by Eugene Strong, who works to preserve similar burial mounds in Pennsylvania and elsewhere.\n\n\u201cThey want to remove the mounds because that is the final act of genocide,\u201d Strong said. \u201cYou\u2019re helping the ancestors; you\u2019re helping the culture and preventing the final act of genocide.\u201d\n\nThe Grand Valley Lanthorn reported that Strong told the students that many have a hard time naming Native Americans in history, and that there is a need to raise awareness about Native history and culture. Showing respect by cleaning up the mounds is one way of doing this.\n\nTerry Frechette, chairman of the West Michigan American Indian Movement, agreed with Strong, adding that many people don\u2019t realize what the mounds are and will throw trash on them, which is why a clean up day is needed at least once a year.", "article_metadata": {"description": "On Nov. 2, students from Grand Valley State University and members of the West Michigan community cleaned up a Native American burial ground.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "leeanne", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2013/11/16/students-and-community-clean-native-burial-mound-heritage-month-152219", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/grand-valley-native-burial-cleanup.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Students and Community Clean Up Native Burial Mound for Heritage Month"}, "dcterms.date": "2013-11-16T10:00-05:00", "dc": {"title": "Students and Community Clean Up Native Burial Mound for Heritage Month"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2013/11/16/students-and-community-clean-native-burial-mound-heritage-month-152219", "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Hopewell Culture, Michigan, Native Burial Mound, Native American Heritage Month", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 2}, "dcterms.title": "Students and Community Clean Up Native Burial Mound for Heritage Month"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdec5b\"", "article_summary": "On November 2, students from Grand Valley State University and members of the West Michigan community teamed up to clean up a Native American burial ground.\nThe day of service was one of their nods to Native American Heritage Month, reports the Grand Valley Lanthorn, a student-run publication.\n\u201cThey want to remove the mounds because that is the final act of genocide,\u201d Strong said.\nThe clean up focused on the Norton Mounds, located just a few miles south of Grand Rapids, Michigan, one of the remaining Hopewell Mounds, which the Grand Rapids Public Museum is working to preserve.\nShowing respect by cleaning up the mounds is one way of doing this."}
