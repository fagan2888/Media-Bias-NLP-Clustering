In fact, Sanders helped write the Affordable Care Act but says more remains to be done to provide better health care at less cost for all Americans, including the 29 million Americans still without health insurance and millions more who are underinsured. Sanders\u2019 proposal would save the typical family more than $5,000 a year.\n\nHer ad claims she would \u201cbreak through the gridlock, not add to it.\u201d In fact, Sanders has worked with Republicans in Congress to pass major legislation. He worked with Sen. John McCain, for example, to pass a $15 billion bill to improve health care for veterans. McCain praised Sanders\u2019 \u201crecord of advocacy for veterans,\u201d but added, \u201cI don\u2019t see how any veteran \u2026 could possibly have any good things, nor could support, her quest for being commander in chief.\u201d\n\nClinton insinuated that Sanders attacked Planned Parenthood. In fact, Sanders has a 100 percent lifetime voting record for Planned Parenthood and defended the group against Republican attempts to cut its budget.\n\nClinton\u2019s ad says she would \u201cstand up to the gun lobby, not protect it.\u201d Sanders has a D- lifetime rating by the National Rifle Association, supports President Barack Obama\u2019s gun safety initiatives. Sanders\u2019 advocacy for gun safety dates back to his 1988 congressional campaign, which he lost by 3 points after calling for a ban on assault weapons. Clinton has flip-flopped on gun issues throughout her career. Once an advocate for registering handguns, she became a gun-friendly candidate in 2008 when she tried to portray Obama as too hard on gun owners.\n\nIn another dig at Sanders, her ad suggests that she would \u201clead on foreign policy, not ignore it.\u201d On the major foreign policy issue of the era, however, she voted for the war in Iraq. Sanders opposed it. He supported President Obama\u2019s overture to Iran which resulted in an agreement with world powers to stop Iran from developing a nuclear arsenal. She called President Barack Obama \u201cna\u00efve\u201d for even talking to Tehran. She wants a no-fly zone in Syria. He disagrees and instead wants Middle East nations to take the lead in fighting the Islamic State to prevent U.S. forces from being drawn into a perpetual conflict.\n\nClinton\u2019s new ad does not offer any proposals for the future. She doesn\u2019t say how she would strengthen Social Security. She doesn\u2019t detail a way to combat climate change. She doesn\u2019t say why she won\u2019t support the leading bills by Democrats in Congress to provide paid family and medical leave. She doesn\u2019t detail her own plan to expand health care for Americans.\n\n\u201cSecretary Clinton is spending a lot of time saying what she\u2019s not going to do. Bernie is spending his time telling Iowa voters and people across the country where he intends to lead the nation as president,\u201d said Jeff Weaver, Sanders\u2019 campaign manager. \u201cBernie Sanders will build on the achievements President Obama has made and build for the future.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hillary Clinton launched a new television commercial on Thursday that distorts Bernie Sanders\u2019 record with not-so-veiled insinuations.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "p": {"domain_verify": "f18692a2ab29de31c0a36b5f208bcaf2"}, "og": {"site_name": "Augusta Free Press", "description": "Hillary Clinton launched a new television commercial on Thursday that distorts Bernie Sanders\u2019 record with not-so-veiled insinuations.", "title": "Sanders disappointed by Clinton attack ads", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 300, "identifier": "http://augustafreepress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Bernie_Sanders.jpg", "height": 300}, "url": "http://augustafreepress.com/sanders-disappointed-by-clinton-attack-ads/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Hillary Clinton launched a new television commercial on Thursday that distorts Bernie Sanders\u2019 record with not-so-veiled insinuations.", "creator": "@AugFreePress", "image": "http://augustafreepress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Bernie_Sanders.jpg", "title": "Sanders disappointed by Clinton attack ads", "site": "@AugFreePress", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "B327D5B772C8966F45B87133E23D6692", "robots": "noodp", "language": "en", "fb": {"admins": 791628486}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://augustafreepress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/cropped-AFPnew-1-270x270.jpg", "google-site-verification": "5eBtcYXpAOKr8protIi54TCO5-2wEpe7pJCAgeDgr8o", "keywords": "hillary clinton, bernie sanders, democratic party, president, tv ads, politics, news, augusta free press, afp", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/AugustaFreePress", "section": "Government/Politics", "tag": "tv ads", "published_time": "2016-01-27T22:21:10-04:00"}, "distribution": "global", "yandex-verification": "6c1367f9682f1673"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe were disappointed but not surprised that Secretary Clinton has decided to broadcast a television ad in Iowa that completely distorts my record,\u201d Sanders said.\nThe new Clinton ad insinuates that Sanders\u2019 Medicare-for-all proposal would undo the Affordable Care Act.\nHe worked with Sen.
