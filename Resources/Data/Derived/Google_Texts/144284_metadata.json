Official Washington was just getting back to business as usual, and a clutch of woolly-looking protesters were chanting outside Cruz\u2019s office in the Dirksen Senate Office Building. Cruz himself was running a little late that morning, and when I was finally ushered into his office, he warned me that he might be grumpy, because he was sick. It was the day before Halloween, and as I set up my recorder, I tried to make small talk\u2014which was, as always, a thankless exercise..\n\n\u201cDo you have a costume?\u201d I asked.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cI have in past years,\u201d he added, gamely. \u201cBut I don\u2019t...\u201d he trailed off.\n\n\u201cWhat was your best costume of all time?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve done Zorro,\u201d Cruz said, and sighed. \u201cZorro wasn\u2019t bad. I\u2019ve done Phantom of the Opera.\u201d He paused, apparently looking for something else to say. \u201cThey\u2019re certainly similar.\u201d\n\nThis was typical of my experience. I had spent hours with Cruz last year, interviewing him for a long profile in Texas Monthly. We talked in Washington in July, when he wasn\u2019t considered much more than a Tea Party pest, newly elected and quoting Ludwig von Mises; in Waco in August, while he was traveling around Texas promoting the effort to defund the Affordable Care Act; in Houston in October, shortly after the end of the shutdown that he had arguably helped start; and several other times. Regardless of the circumstances, each time I tried to make small talk with him, it was boring. I was bored. And he seemed bored too, as he dutifully fielded my questions, trying and often failing to turn up interesting answers.\n\nIn this respect Cruz, in person, proved to be quite different from the Cruz we\u2019ve seen on the national stage, the polarizing phenomenon most famous for his 21-hour stop-Obamacare-or-else pseudo-filibuster last fall. I found him to be pleasant, buttoned-up and even a little bland. It was only when asked about politics, policy or the law that he came to life: ferociously smart, talkative, engaged. Critics see the senator as a loudmouth, a firebrand and a loose cannon\u2014which is not surprising given that Cruz spent much of his first year in the Senate offending his colleagues, Republican and Democrat alike, in battles over gun control (\u201cI am not a sixth grader,\u201d Sen. Dianne Feinstein snapped at him), immigration reform, Chuck Hagel\u2019s nomination for secretary of defense and, of course, Obamacare.\n\nJust last week, Cruz picked another fight with his own caucus. Although Democrats control the Senate, he announced, they would have to convince at least five Republicans to join them in supporting a bill to raise the debt ceiling or else he would delay the bill by filibustering. In doing so, he raised the ire of colleagues like Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who was forced to vote to forestall the filibuster\u2014and might take some heat back home for doing so.\n\nFightin\u2019 Words Cruz has never gone easy on his fellow Republicans. On the debt ceiling vote: \"Today's vote is yet another example that establishment politicians from both parties are simply not listening to the American people. \u2026 Some members of Congress care so much about being praised by the Washington media that they're willing to mortgage our children's future.\u201d \u2014 Feb. 12, 2014 On his threatening to filibuster Democratic gun legislation: \u201cWe\u2019ve had probably five or six lunches with a bunch of Republican senators standing up and looking at Rand [Paul] and Mike [Lee] and me and yelling at us at the top of their lungs \u2026 \u2018Look, why did you do this? As a result of what you did, when I go home, my constituents are yelling at me that I\u2019ve got to stand on principle.\u2019 \u2026 There are a lot of people that don\u2019t like to be held accountable. \u2026 They said: \u2018Listen, before you did this, the politics of it were great. The Dems were the bad guys. The Republicans were the good guys. Now we all look like a bunch of squishes.\u2019 Well there is an alternative. You could just not be a bunch of squishes.\u201d \u2014 April 26, 2013 On whether Mitch McConnell should continue to be Senate Minority Leader: \u201cThat is ultimately a decision \u2026 for the voters of Kentucky to make. \u2026 Each senator, each representative makes a decision about how he or she will vote, and when those votes are clear to their constituents, democracy works far better.\u201d \u2014 Feb. 12, 2014 On colleagues who didn\u2019t join his filibuster of Obamacare: \u201cSenators should not be asleep when the nation is undergoing a nightmare.\u201d \u2014 Sept. 24, 2013 On the Republican plan to defund Obamacare: \u201cMy observations right now that there are some Republicans that would like a symbolic vote and would like to lose so that they don\u2019t have any risk of it actually being defunded, I promise you those comments are not getting me invited to any cocktail parties in Washington anytime soon. And that\u2019s perfectly fine. I don\u2019t particularly enjoy cocktail parties anyway.\u201d \u2014 Sept. 24, 2013\n\nIt was a contentious, divisive, even obnoxious thing for Cruz to do, and it didn\u2019t make any sense, which is perhaps the most confounding thing about Ted Cruz: He\u2019s clearly smart, and he thinks a lot about strategy. He has no known demons that would drive him to self-sabotage. Yet since being sworn in last year, he has fallen on his sword several times for highly dubious reasons.\n\nSo, why do it?\n\nI keep coming back to my conversations with him last fall. Although he hadn\u2019t had much appetite for small talk, he always perked up when my questions turned to fiscal matters and budget cutting\u2014and the subject of whether his fellow Republicans really got it.\n\nOne particular exchange seemed telling: When we met in his Hill office last October, he was giving an impassioned take on his plans for fiscal discipline when he mentioned the need for entitlement reform, saying that he wanted to ensure the viability of Social Security and Medicare over the long term, rather than whittling away at them.\n\n\u201cWhy do you think President Bush\u2019s effort to reform Social Security got so little traction?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cBecause Congressional Republicans ran for the hills,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cIt was one of the most courageous things President Bush did in his second term, was taking on Social Security. He was right to do it, and unfortunately, on Capitol Hill he had virtually no allies.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy did they run for the hills?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause the dominant instinct in Congress is risk aversion,\u201d he said.\n\nHis attitude was placid, as if he were again observing that Zorro and the Phantom wear similar masks, as if he either didn\u2019t realize or didn\u2019t care that this was a pretty cutting thing to say, that it was exactly the kind of comment that might irritate his colleagues.\n\nCruz was, at that point, aware of the criticisms that had been directed at him during the effort to defund Obamacare, and defiant about them: Although he acknowledged that the defunding strategy wasn\u2019t likely to succeed, he insisted that it had a chance to do so\u2014and that other Republicans hadn\u2019t offered a better strategy for stopping the law before it took effect, on Oct. 1 of last year.\n\nBut even prior to the defunding campaign, he had been casually critical of his party on many occasions. During that first interview, in July, he went out of his way to tweak fellow Republicans. \u201cFor a long time, the federal government, I believe, has spent too much, taxed too much, regulated too much and borrowed too much,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that has been a bipartisan affliction\u2014an awful lot of Republicans were complicit in exploding the size, power and spending of the federal government.\u201d As political rhetoric goes, it was benign enough. It certainly wasn\u2019t as aggressive as when he implied, in July, as he was starting to talk about the defunding strategy, that moderate Republicans in the Senate can be summarized as a \u201csurrender caucus,\u201d for example.\n\nBut Cruz has a pattern of making such comments, and of acting on them, as he did last week. Both his debt-ceiling gambit and the defunding campaign were practically guaranteed to fail, and to annoy his colleagues in the process. And that being the case, for Cruz\u2019s many critics, last week\u2019s stunt probably seemed like pointless, annoying grandstanding\u2014and odd, given that Cruz could use some allies in Congress if he has any aspirations for higher office, which he presumably does. (Cruz, who is 43, said several things during our interviews that gave me the impression he has already considered how he might justify running for president at such a relatively young age and with less than a full term under his belt\u2014that the country doesn\u2019t have forever to address its fiscal and economic issues, and so on. And although some of Cruz\u2019s more ardent supporters have harrumphed that he should abandon the surrender caucus and lead a new party, I found no indication that he wants to leave the Republican fold. \u201cI am not a fan of third parties,\u201d he told me, when I pressed him on that question.)\n\nThere was, however, one difference between the defund-Obamacare campaign and the debt- ceiling stunt\u2014and it\u2019s a difference that may illuminate a politician who can seem inexplicable. With regard to the defunding campaign, Cruz had insisted to me on several occasions that there was a plausible, if unlikely, objective: that if Senate Republicans stood together, a handful of Democrats\u2014red-state Democrats facing reelection in 2014, to start\u2014might be moved to join them. Last week, though, there wasn\u2019t even a theoretical policy goal.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO Magazine", "description": "The junior senator from Texas is a smart political operator\u2014so why can\u2019t he resist picking so many losing fights with members of his own party?", "title": "Cruz Control", "url": "http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/02/senator-ted-cruz-profile-103799.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/02/21/140221_grieder_cruz_ap.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Republicans,Texas,The POLITICO Mag Profile,Ted Cruz", "twitter": {"site": "@politicomag", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politicomag"}, "description": "The junior senator from Texas is a smart political operator\u2014so why can\u2019t he resist picking so many losing fights with members of his own party?", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Just last week, Cruz picked another fight with his own caucus.\nOfficial Washington was just getting back to business as usual, and a clutch of woolly-looking protesters were chanting outside Cruz\u2019s office in the Dirksen Senate Office Building.\nOn the debt ceiling vote: \"Today's vote is yet another example that establishment politicians from both parties are simply not listening to the American people.\nAnd he seemed bored too, as he dutifully fielded my questions, trying and often failing to turn up interesting answers.\nI had spent hours with Cruz last year, interviewing him for a long profile in Texas Monthly."}
