YouTube videos of the toddler draining shot after shot, many times increasing in difficulty, resulted in a number of viral videos and appearances on \u201cToday,\u201d \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live\u201d and \u201cThe Glenn Beck Radio Program.\u201d\n\nThe overwhelming success of the toddler\u2019s trick shot videos brought in money that his parents plan to save for Titus and his three siblings. However, that plan has officially hit its first snag, according to the toddler\u2019s father, Joseph Ashby.\n\nThe problem\u2019s name is Obamacare.\n\nAshby, an aerospace engineer and radio host in Wichita, Kan., told TheBlaze that he recently received a letter from his family\u2019s health insurance provider informing him that their policy no longer complies with federal law under Obamacare. The replacement plan allegedly comes with a roughly 535 percent deductible increase \u2014 before the plan helps out with medical bills. The replacement plan also reduces the number of plan-covered doctor visits from five to as few as two, and doubles the co-pay for each visit, he said.\n\n\u201cThe old plan had a $1,000 deductible before the plan kicked in. After that, the old plan paid 80 percent and we paid 20 percent until we got to another $1,000. The new plan has a $6,350 deductible before they kick in anything,\u201d he explained.\n\nFurther, Ashby claims the plan\u2019s vision coverage is dropped and the monthly premium is still higher than the old policy. The family may end up paying as much as $10,000 more over the next year in medical costs under the new Obamacare-compliant plan, he said.\n\nAshby told TheBlaze the $10,000 estimation is based on a combination of higher premiums and likely medical payment his family would have to make with the increased deductible.\n\n\u201cI just want to make it clear that if my family was in the deepest pit of Nova Scotia with the Rocky Mountains piled on top of us, we\u2019d make it out. We\u2019re not here to complain,\u201d the father said. \u201cI just want people to know what Obamacare is \u2014 and isn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nTo back up his claims, Ashby provided TheBlaze copies of his old plan and the details of the new plans he can now choose from.\n\n\u201cThe money from the viral videos (meant for Titus\u2019 and his siblings\u2019 future) is small compared to the family\u2019s new health care cost,\u201d reads a post on Ashby\u2019s Facebook page.\n\n\u201cThe folks in Washington who are doing so much to try and stop the law are fighting a good fight. We all want people to get medical care, but we can\u2019t embrace a law that hurts so many others in the process.\u201d\n\nThe original Titus trick shot video has more than 12 million views on YouTube:\n\nCarousel image via AP/Jessica Hill.
