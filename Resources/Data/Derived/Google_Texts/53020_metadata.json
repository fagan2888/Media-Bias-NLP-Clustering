He goes on to say that if changes are not made, \u201cit may be forced to abandon free healthcare for all.\u201d\n\nAmericans must take a good look at this situation. Here is a modern, developed, Western country that instituted socialized medicine, and it is collapsing around them. If the Brits can\u2019t get this right, what is the future for socialized medicine in America?\n\nAs Western populations age, it is a common thread that their healthcare systems will come under enormous strain. Simply put, there are less working men and women to support a large number of older, more expensive patients. This is not rocket science. No matter what costs are taken out of the system, it is a fact that healthcare will have to be rationed. The death panels under a socialized system will become a reality.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nI recently spent a week in a Russian hospital due to a kidney stone and experienced socialized medicine (the real thing) first hand. The people were generous, hard working, and compassionate. However, they did not have enough resources to do the job. Of course, if you have a lot of money, you can get admitted to a private hospital, but that is not where they took me when I collapsed at a flat in the center of Moscow.\n\nFirst, there was no toilet paper. You had to bring your own drinking water. There was one dirty bathroom per room. When I arrived at the hospital, the doctor asked me how long I wanted to stay. My reply was, shouldn\u2019t you be telling me that? My girlfriend said he wanted money. I could not get access to the ultrasound machine to destroy the stone as the line was too long. There were about twenty-five people in one room, all with varying degrees of problems. Their family members took care of them day-to-day.\n\nThis is not the Russian people\u2019s fault. It is simply the result of socialized medicine. It cannot compete with the free market.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nThis is where Barack Obama and our leftist friends want to bring us.\n\nIf there is one thing you can count on, it is progressives and their desire to control others. This will eventually happen in our healthcare system. There is no other way for it to go. It will not end well.\n\nAmerica should end this experiment with government control and repeal Obamacare for good before it\u2019s too late.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by the owners of this website.", "article_metadata": {"description": "This is where Barack Obama and our leftist friends want to bring us.", "author": "L.
