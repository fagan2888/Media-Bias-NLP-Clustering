Montreal police are investigating an incident in which a gang of teenaged boys attacked a pregnant woman in the city\u2019s north end and knocked her down while attempting to remove her head covering.\n\nThe attack is one of several incidences of anti-Muslim harassment that are reported to have occurred in Quebec, where the issue of \u201creasonable accommodation\u201d of ethnic and religious minorities is especially charged.\n\nIn addition to encouraging Canadians to report \u201cbarbaric cultural practices\u201d, the Conservatives re-affirmed their determination to cancel the citizenship of convicted terrorists, even those born in Canada.\n\nAlthough widely supported by voters responding to polls, the Conservative\u2019s aggressive attack against a minority culture has drawn strong condemnation from opposition politicians and others. On Thursday, the Quebec provincial legislature adopted a motion condemning Islamophobia. Further west, the popular mayor of Calgary, Muslim immigrant Naheed Nenshi, attacked the Conservative initiatives as \u201cunbelievably dangerous.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is disgusting and we have to stop it,\u201d said Nenshi.\n\nIn return, Conservative defence minister Jason Kenney accused Nenshi \u201cand people like him\u201d of politicizing the niqab issue.\n\nThe most recent results of national polls show the Conservatives have broken free of the three-way deadlock that characterized the first half of the race and now enjoy a clear lead.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Pledge comes on the heels of a surge in opinion polls based on a hardline stance against a woman donning her Muslim headwear during a citizenship ceremony., barbaric cultural practices, Canada, conservatives, hotline,", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "The Guardian", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "Pledge comes on the heels of a surge in opinion polls based on a hardline stance against a woman donning her Muslim headwear during a citizenship ceremony., barbaric cultural practices, Canada, conservatives, hotline,", "title": "Canada's Conservatives Vow To Create 'Barbaric Cultural Practices' Hotline", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/canadas-conservatives-vow-to-create-barbaric-cultural-practices-hotline/210061/", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Harper-Life-Sentence_Muha.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-10-02T19:56:10-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Pledge comes on the heels of a surge in opinion polls based on a hardline stance against a woman donning her Muslim headwear during a citizenship ceremony., barbaric cultural practices, Canada, conservatives, hotline,", "title": "Canada's Conservatives Vow To Create 'Barbaric Cultural Practices' Hotline", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Harper-Life-Sentence_Muha.jpg", "creator": "@MintPressNews", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Daily Digest", "tag": "hotline", "published_time": "2015-10-03T05:00:56-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-02T19:56:10-05:00"}}, "article_summary": "In addition to encouraging Canadians to report \u201cbarbaric cultural practices\u201d, the Conservatives re-affirmed their determination to cancel the citizenship of convicted terrorists, even those born in Canada.\nCanada\u2019s ruling Conservatives have pledged to set up a police hotline to report what it called \u201cbarbaric cultural practices\u201d, as it sought to capitalize on a hardline stance which has helped it gain in the polls.\nAlthough widely supported by voters responding to polls, the Conservative\u2019s aggressive attack against a minority culture has drawn strong condemnation from opposition politicians and others.\n\u201cWe need to stand up for our values,\u201d said immigration minister Chris Alexander, as he announced the new initiative on Friday.\nIn return, Conservative defence minister Jason Kenney accused Nenshi \u201cand people like him\u201d of politicizing the niqab issue."}
