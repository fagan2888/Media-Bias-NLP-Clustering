When he returned shortly after 1 p.m., he heard a baby crying, but saw no one else around.\n\nThat's when, according to New York City police, the custodian turned to a nativity scene in the front of the church and saw a newborn baby wrapped in towels laying in the manger. Church pastor Christopher Heanue wrote on the church's Facebook page that the baby was a boy and weighed a little more than five pounds.\n\nAuthorities believed he was four to five hours old when he was found. Emergency crews brought the newborn to a local hospital, where he was in good health, police said.\n\nCustodian Jose Moran, a father of two, told CBS New York he was stunned and saddened - \"mucho tristesa y nervioso\" - upon seeing the baby in the nativity scene. Members of the church have nicknamed the boy \"Baby Jesus.\"\n\nBishop Octavio Cisneros of the Archdiocese of Brooklyn and Queens said not knowing the mother's circumstances, he was relieved she chose to leave the child in the safety of the church.\n\n\"The baby was crying, so obviously, he was well. He was breathing; had a good color,\" Cisneros said. \"And we noticed that his umbilical cord was still attached.\"\n\nNew York has a so-called Safe Haven Law that says a newborn up to 30 days old can be dropped off anonymously at a church, hospital, police or fire station without fear of prosecution. But the law, known as the Abandoned Infant Protection Act, requires that the child be left with someone or for authorities to be called immediately.\n\nPolice said that didn't happen in this case, which led investigators to begin searching for the mother.\n\nAuthorities said surveillance video from a nearby store shows the unidentified mother carrying her newborn baby boy into a store, just minutes before she left him at the church.\n\nThe woman is seen picking up a towel and then paying for it at the front counter. The store clerk told CBS New York another customer seen in the video asked the mother if she was holding a baby, and the mother said yes.\n\nIn deciding not to bring charges, Brown said the mother followed the spirit of the Safe Haven law.\n\n\"It appears that the mother, in this case, felt her newborn child would be found safely in the church and chose to place the baby in the manger because it was the warmest place in the church, and further she returned the following morning to make certain that the baby had been found,\" Brown said.\n\n\"I was shocked, and yet really moved by it,\" Heanue said. \"You know, the church is meant to be home for those in need.\"\n\nMembers of the parish said there are already several people expressing their wishes to adopt the baby boy.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A mother who left her newborn baby in a Christmas manger inside a New York City church will not be prosecuted, authorities said Wednesday.", "language": "english", "author": "CBS/AP", "og": {"url": "http://www.kktv.com/news/headlines/No-Charges-For-Woman-Who-Left-Baby-In-NYC-Nativity-Scene-Manger-355839091.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/baby-12.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A mother who left her newborn baby in a Christmas manger inside a New York City church will not be prosecuted, authorities said Wednesday.", "title": "No Charges For Woman Who Left Baby In NYC Nativity Scene Manger"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kktv.com", "description": "A mother who left her newborn baby in a Christmas manger inside a New York City church will not be prosecuted, authorities said Wednesday.", "title": "No Charges For Woman Who Left Baby In NYC Nativity Scene Manger", "url": "http://www.kktv.com/news/headlines/No-Charges-For-Woman-Who-Left-Baby-In-NYC-Nativity-Scene-Manger-355839091.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/baby-12.jpg", "creator": "@kktv11news", "site": "@kktv11news", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "keywords": "No Charges For Woman Who Left Baby In NYC Nativity Scene Manger", "google-site-verification": "gUw-UdhXT7u-BunNWfQWA_t3azu7BEGubOcNT6HddJQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "No Charges For Woman Who, Left Baby In NYC Nativity"}, "article_summary": "Members of the parish said there are already several people expressing their wishes to adopt the baby boy.\nCBS New York reported that around 11:30 a.m. Monday, a custodian at the church left the empty chapel to get lunch.\nCredit: CBS New YorkA mother who left her newborn baby in a Christmas manger inside a New York City church will not be prosecuted, authorities said Wednesday.\nThat's when, according to New York City police, the custodian turned to a nativity scene in the front of the church and saw a newborn baby wrapped in towels laying in the manger.\nMembers of the church have nicknamed the boy \"Baby Jesus.\""}
