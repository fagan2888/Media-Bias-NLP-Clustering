Analysts on average were expecting revenue to fall to $887.8 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\n\nAMD said on Thursday it signed a $293 million agreement to license its processor technology to a joint venture it formed with Tianjin Haiguang Advanced Technology Investment Co Ltd, an investment unit of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.\n\nThe technology will help China produce its own server chips for datacenters, a market dominated by Intel Corp, one of AMD's biggest rivals along with Nvidia Corp.\n\n\"This deal is at least one victory lap on monetizing its IP. I expect more to come in the future, especially with GPUs (graphic processing units),\" Moor Insights & Strategy analyst Patrick Moorhead said.\n\nAMD said it expects the licensing deal to add about $52 million to 2016 revenue, with $7 million already recognized in latest first quarter.\n\nChief Executive Lisa Su said AMD's revenue would increase more than usual on a sequential basis this quarter due to strong demand for its graphics chips and semi-custom chips, designed to suit customers' specific needs.\n\nAMD is slated to ship its Polaris GPUs in the middle of the year, which it hopes will lead to revenue growth in 2016 after 2015 revenue declined 27.5 percent.\n\nThe company's first-quarter revenue fell 19.2 percent year-over-year, to $832 million, but beat analysts estimates of $818.2 million.\n\nNet loss narrowed to $109 million, or 14 cents per share, from $180 million, or 23 cents per share. Excluding items, AMD lost 12 cents per share. Analysts were expecting a loss of 13 cents.\n\nAMD's shares were up 21 percent at $3.17 in extended trading. They had fallen 8.7 this year through Thursday's close, while the broader semiconductor index had gained 0.6 percent.\n\n(Reporting by Kshitiz Goliya and Rishika Sadam in Bengaluru; Editing by Sayantani Ghosh and Savio D'Souza)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/21/AMD-quarterly-revenue-slumps-192-percent", "type": "article", "site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "(Reuters) - Advanced Micro Devices Inc's forecast implied that the struggling chipmake", "title": "AMD flags possible stop to revenue declines, shares soar"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/21/AMD-quarterly-revenue-slumps-192-percent", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "(Reuters) - Advanced Micro Devices Inc's forecast implied that the struggling chipmake", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "AMD said it expects the licensing deal to add about $52 million to 2016 revenue, with $7 million already recognized in latest first quarter.\nNet loss narrowed to $109 million, or 14 cents per share, from $180 million, or 23 cents per share.\nThe company forecast second-quarter revenue would grow 15 percent, plus or minus 3 percent, sequentially, which translates to $928.1 million to $985.5 million.\nThe company's first-quarter revenue fell 19.2 percent year-over-year, to $832 million, but beat analysts estimates of $818.2 million.\nAMD also reported a lower-than-expected drop in revenue for the third quarter in a row due, in part, to the licensing deal, helping send the company's shares surging 21 percent in trading after the bell on Thursday."}
