Shared privately with The Hill, it shows a Web user scrolling through a database of agency files, accompanied by threats and ominous music.\n\nPrivate security experts who reviewed the video said it appears the hackers might have gained access to the back end of the National Archives website, where content is updated.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArchives officials insisted the group behind the video had not succeeded in accessing private data at the agency and directed additional inquiries to law enforcement.\n\n\u201cThe National Archives and Records Administration has not suffered a data breach,\u201d National Archives Chief Operating Officer William J. Bosanko said in a statement.\n\n\u201cIn the last several months we have faced several unauthorized attempts to access our public-facing website Archives.gov,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, we do not believe that any of these attempts resulted in access to information that is not otherwise available to the public.\n\n\u201cLike all departments and agencies, our cybersecurity infrastructure is regularly a target and we routinely assess our security measures to address vulnerabilities.\u201d\n\nThe YouTube video underscores the growing threat of cyberattacks to federal agencies, which experience thousands of hacking attempts every day.\n\nA data breach at the National Archives could endanger the personal information of former high-ranking administration officials and family members of former presidents.\n\nGovernment offices have recently suffered a variety of hits that have laid bare everything from employee information to unclassified email systems.\n\nAt the U.S. Postal Service, information for 800,000 employees was exposed.\n\nAt the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, federal weather tracking and prediction data was taken.\n\nAt the White House and State Department, email systems were infiltrated, and three months later, parts of the networks are still down.\n\nThe repeated incidents have led to criticism of the Obama administration\u2019s ability to protect itself from digital intruders.\n\nChinese and Russian hackers are widely suspected in most of the incidents, although the government has never confirmed who its digital assailants are.\n\nThe Archives incident might resemble the recent hack of the U.S. Central Command Twitter and YouTube accounts.\n\nGroups claiming affiliation with the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) briefly took over the social media accounts to disseminate ISIS propaganda and what they claimed were classified documents. It later turned out the documents were publicly available.\n\nSecurity experts interviewed by The Hill said hackers could have potentially used a stolen password or website flaw to gain access to the Archive\u2019s content management system.\n\nIt\u2019s possible, but unlikely, that they could then jump from the website to the broader Archives network, where sensitive data is stored, experts said.\n\n\u201cIf the Archives has configured their network appropriately \u2026 and they\u2019re using something like a breach detection system \u2026 then it\u2019s OK,\u201d said Tom Kellermann, chief cybersecurity officer at security research firm Trend Micro.\n\nHowever, digital attackers have the power to deface a website once they\u2019ve gained access to the back end, said David Kennedy, CEO of security firm TrustedSec.\n\nThis leads experts to believe the hackers are looking to make a political statement, perhaps trying to show they can \u201crewrite history,\u201d Kellermann said.\n\n\u201cIt is symbolism at its best,\u201d he added. \u201cThey\u2019re attempting to demonstrate how they can attack the archives of American history in real time.\u201d\n\nEven if the hacking techniques used are quite simple, \u201cpsychologically speaking,\u201d the video displays \u201can increase of their level of sophistication.\u201d\n\nThe National Archives took considerable heat in 2010, after a data breach exposed the personal information of 250,000 Clinton administration staff members, job applicants and White House visitors.\n\nIn total, more than 100,000 Social Security numbers were lost at that time. The breach was the result of a computer hard drive that went missing from a storage collection.\n\nThat incident came only months after the agency\u2019s inspector general had investigated another Archives data breach involving the records for 70 million U.S. military veterans. The investigation found the agency had sent back a faulty hard drive for repairs without first deleting the veterans\u2019 records.\n\nThe agency later concluded that veterans\u2019 information was never accessed on the hard drive, and it had never been in unauthorized hands during the repair.\n\nArchives officials asked that the YouTube video not be shared out of concern that it might inspire other hackers.\n\nThis story was updated at 8:22 p.m.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The breach would be the latest in a string of cyberattacks on major U.S. agencies.", "description": "The breach would be the latest in a string of cyberattacks on major U.S. agencies.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Elise Viebeck and Cory Bennett", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The breach would be the latest in a string of cyberattacks on major U.S. agencies.", "title": "Police probe video of possible data hack at the National Archives", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/233825-national-archives-hit-with-data-breach", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/nationalarchives_091210getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:59:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:59-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/233825-national-archives-hit-with-data-breach", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2015-02-25T14:07-05:00", "dcterms.creator": "Ben Goad", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-25T14:07:58-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:59:59-05:00"}, "keywords": ",,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/233825-national-archives-hit-with-data-breach", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The breach would be the latest in a string of cyberattacks on major U.S. agencies.", "card": "summary", "title": "Police probe video of possible data hack at the National Archives"}, "dcterms.title": "Police probe video of possible data hack at the National Archives"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0b1f\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe National Archives and Records Administration has not suffered a data breach,\u201d National Archives Chief Operating Officer William J.
