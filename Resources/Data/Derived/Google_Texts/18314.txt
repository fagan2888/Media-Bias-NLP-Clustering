The Senate Appropriations Committee on Thursday adopted an amendment that would direct the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to seek public comment on a proposed rule regarding captive marine mammals.

The rule, she said, has been stuck at the Office of Management and Budget since 2012.

“This amendment is really a no-brainer,” Feinstein said. “Current animal welfare standards are more than 20 years old and don’t reflect studies for large marine mammals like orcas.”

Documentaries about abuse within animal theme parks such as CNN’s “Blackfish” have raised questions about whether animals can thrive in confinement, Feinstein argued.

“I think the time has come where we’ve got to take a look at the science,” she said. “All I know is that these rules, under the specific mandate of the USDA, have been delayed for 12 years because of lobbying. None of us have seen them.”

Feinstein wants the public, scientists and people within the industry to be able to comment on the proposed regulation.

The amendment was adopted in a 18-12 vote, but some lawmakers questioned how broad Feinstein's proposal could go, even though the California Democrat was only talking about killer whales during the debate.
