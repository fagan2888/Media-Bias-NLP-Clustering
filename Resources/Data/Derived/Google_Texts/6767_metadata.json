I would tell you that Mike Rowe would disagree with you. There are millions of jobs that are available right now, but are they \u2018below\u2019 you?\u201d\n\nBeck said that while it may be extraordinarily difficult to find a job right now, it is much easier to \u201ccreate\u201d one.\n\n\u201cFind a problem and fix it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe problems are merely opportunities.\u201d\n\nBeck suggested as an example: \u201cGot a bunch of leaves in your yard? Take pictures of all of the leaves, or if you don\u2019t have a yard, go find someplace else \u2026 Take a picture of all the leaves, and then go find a rake and rake all the leaves. I mean every single leaf \u2026 Find your joy in raking those leaves. Take all the pictures of how bad it was \u2026 and then do the best job you possibly can and show all of the pictures afterwards. Then post those photos on Facebook and tweet them with the following caption: \u2018I will do the best job of raking leaves you\u2019ve ever seen. Reply and I\u2019ll quote you a rate.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe radio host said that when you leave your home you should always tell yourself you are going to do \u201cvery best job you possibly can,\u201d and when you get home you should ask whether you did the \u201cvery best\u201d you could.\n\nIf you approach every day with that mindset, he said, it won\u2019t be long before \u201cyour unemployed child will not be so unemployed\u201d or \u201cyou won\u2019t be so unemployed.\u201d\n\n\u201cBefore you know it, your kids will be moving out of the house,\u201d he said. \u201cOr you\u2019ll be able to afford the food that you need to provide. By creating more business that didn\u2019t exist.\u201d\n\nBeck told his audience that \u201cthe world is changing,\u201d and suggested that if you are doing a job that you \u201chate,\u201d you figure out what it is you are supposed to be doing instead.\n\n\u201cBut it all really starts with work,\u201d he reminded. \u201cThere is nothing more fulfilling than work.\u201d\n\nAnd for those who bemoan the state of the economy, Beck said: \u201cThere is only one economy that matters: your economy. And your economy starts with two hands. And the talent that you were born with. Everyone was born with exactly every tool (they) need.\u201d\n\n\u201cListen to me carefully,\u201d he concluded. \u201cWe have played that game before: \u2018Well, if I could just get somebody in Hollywood\u2026If I could just get a producer\u2026If I could just get a banker to understand.\u2019 No. All in due time, all in God\u2019s way. But know this: Everything that you need you have right now. What is it you were sent here to do? Pick up a rake. Pick up a rake and start finding it.\u201d\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nThe full episode of The Glenn Beck Program, along with many other live streaming shows and thousands of hours of on-demand content, is available on just about any digital device.
