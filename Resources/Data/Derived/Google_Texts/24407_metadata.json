The team\u2019s record never strays too far from the mind of the first-year Nuggets coach.\n\nBut there are days when Malone can appreciate the process. Sunday was one of them.\n\nFriday, the Nuggets couldn\u2019t make plays down the stretch in a loss at home to the Brooklyn Nets. Two days later, the Nuggets made all the plays necessary late in the fourth quarter and then in overtime to notch a 116-114 victory over the Dallas Mavericks at the Pepsi Center.\n\n\u201cThese are great opportunities for our young players,\u201d Malone said. \u201cEvery game we play goes down to the wire. It\u2019s hard to replicate that. What great experiences. I\u2019m just happy we got a win while we\u2019re learning. We\u2019re still a work in progress, but it\u2019s always good to get a win to reward our guys.\u201d\n\nGetting the reward required staying the course and surviving a second-half barrage of 3-pointers. After a first half in which the Nuggets had the 3-point line under control defensively, the second half was a different story.\n\nThe Mavericks found open shooters everywhere around the arc, but much of the damage had been done in the corners. They hit 14 3-pointers in the second half and overtime after going just 2-of-10 from the arc in the first half.\n\n\u201cWe talked about their small ball, and how we dreaded their small ball,\u201d Malone said. \u201cVery early in the third quarter, they take (center) Zaza (Pachulia) out and they go small. So I had a big smile on my face, saying, \u2018Here we go.\u2019 Sure enough, that small-ball lineup is able to generate a ton of 3s.\u201d\n\nBut the Mavs couldn\u2019t stop the Nuggets from getting a big steal by rookie point guard Emmanuel Mudiay, who dished to Kenneth Faried for a dunk that tied the game and sent it to overtime.\n\nThen, in overtime, D.J. Augustin took over.\n\nHe scored eight of the Nuggets\u2019 10 points in the extra frame \u2014 he finished the game with 12 points.\n\n\u201cI was just being aggressive even though I missed a few shots in the first half,\u201d Augustin said. \u201cMy teammates did a great job of helping me.\u201d\n\nAugustin tied the game at 111 on a 3-pointer with 54.1 seconds left in the overtime session. But Dallas\u2019 Wesley Matthews was fouled shooting a 3-pointer with 35.2 seconds left and made all three free throws.\n\nNever one to let an opportunity for a big shot go unchecked, Augustin nailed a 3-pointer with 28.8 seconds left to tie the score at 114. Then, after the Nuggets got a defensive stop, Augustin was fouled with 0.9 seconds to play. He made both free throws. Mudiay blocked a Dallas buzzer shot by Matthews to seal the win.\n\n\u201cHe just took it over,\u201d Mudiay said of Augustin. \u201cAnd when someone is rolling like that, you just have to give it to him. I feel like in overtime it was the D.J. Augustin show, so we were going to ride with him.\u201d\n\nThe Nuggets (25-38) had a number of big performances all over the court. Faried produced a monster game, finishing with 25 points and 20 rebounds. Will Barton scored 20 points off the bench. Mudiay finished with 16 points, eight assists, four rebounds, two steals and two blocked shots.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a much-needed win,\u201d Malone said. \u201cI\u2019m happy for our guys.\u201d\n\nChristopher Dempsey: cdempsey@denverpost.com or @dempseypost", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Nuggets rally to defeat Mavericks in overtime at home", "title": "Nuggets rally to defeat Mavericks in overtime at home", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/03/06/nuggets-rally-to-defeat-mavericks-in-overtime-at-home/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160306__nuggets-blockp1.jpg", "height": 495}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160306__nuggets-blockp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-06T18:10:14+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-15T01:43:03+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI was just being aggressive even though I missed a few shots in the first half,\u201d Augustin said.\nHe scored eight of the Nuggets\u2019 10 points in the extra frame \u2014 he finished the game with 12 points.\nThey hit 14 3-pointers in the second half and overtime after going just 2-of-10 from the arc in the first half.\nFriday, the Nuggets couldn\u2019t make plays down the stretch in a loss at home to the Brooklyn Nets.\nAfter a first half in which the Nuggets had the 3-point line under control defensively, the second half was a different story."}
