From the Woolworth Building to the Sears Tower, they held top corporations wishing to express their success and ambitions to clients and investors in the form of sweeping views on high floors of iconic edifices.\n\nBut times are changing for the office sector.\n\nTake Facebook The company is in the midst of building a new 430,000-square-foot headquarters in Silicon Valley.\n\nWhile an office tower of that size could rise higher than 20 floors, Facebook\u2019s building is merely a single floor, stretched out over one-third of a mile, the size of seven football fields.\n\nBuilt on stilts over parking, It could be likened it to a giant Home Depot, but one with a roof garden pockmarked with skylights that allow light to stream to workers below. The theory is that workers collaborate better when in close proximity, and aren\u2019t separated by stairs or elevators that inhabit interaction\u2014a focus on the employee, rather than impressing outsiders with grandeur.\n\nTech companies across the world are building or occupying similar style buildings.\n\nTwitter\u2019s headquarters is in a sprawling former wholesale furniture mart on San Francisco\u2019s Market Street. Google last year unveiled plans for a so-called \u201cground-scraper\u201d in London, a 1 million square foot building that is longer than London\u2019s Shard tower is tall. In New York, the search giant occupies one of the largest buildings in the city that is just 18 floors high.\n\nMeanwhile, the high-end residential market has flipped. The toniest addresses in New York were long brick co-ops and townhouses on the Upper East Side, like the 17-story 740 Park Ave.\n\nBut a strange phenomenon has played out in Manhattan \u2013 and to some extent London and San Francisco and Miami\u2014since the economic downturn. Prices for the highest-end new condominiums have skyrocketed, particularly for those that rise above than anything else in the sky. While $10 million was once a big number for a residential sale, now pricey apartments with in skyscrapers go for $40 million, while the upper crust nears $100 million. Even wire mesh storage bins in such towers list for $200,000.\n\nEliot Brown / The Wall Street Journal\n\nJust what\u2019s driving this geyser of demand is a matter of debate. But whatever one attributes this to\u2014be it a bubble created by a flood of international investor speculation or a hunger for real estate by the growing super-affluent class\u2013it is spurring many a developer to start building slim and tall towers.\n\nOf course, older preferences haven\u2019t gone away. There is still demand for office towers \u2013 new ones are sprouting around San Francisco and Manhattan \u2013 and Park Avenue co-ops are hardly a bargain.\n\nBut if nothing else, the trend is dramatically changing what it takes to leave a mark on the skyline of Manhattan.\n\nIn the past, a skyline-altering building would hold more than 5,000 employees.\n\nToday? It just takes dozens of wealthy families to make up one of the tallest buildings in the world.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "An inversion is going on in the real estate world: the wealthy are clamoring to buy glassy apartments that soar high in the skyline, while the fastest growing companies are demanding spacious low-slung buildings and eschewing tall towers.", "title": "Space Shift: As Wealthiest Flock to Supertall Condos, Offices Go Horizontal", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/developments/2014/10/14/space-shift-as-wealthiest-flock-to-supertall-condos-offices-go-horizontal/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "wsjrealestate", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Real Estate", "article.headline": "Space Shift: As Wealthiest Flock to Supertall Condos, Offices Go Horizontal", "description": "An inversion is going on in the real estate world: the wealthy are clamoring to buy glassy apartments that soar high in the skyline, while the fastest growing companies are demanding spacious low-slung buildings and eschewing tall towers.", "article_section": "Real Estate", "author": "Eliot Brown", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Developments Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Developments", "article.summary": "An inversion is going on in the real estate world: the wealthy are clamoring to buy glassy apartments that soar high in the skyline, while the fastest growing companies are demanding spacious low-slung buildings and eschewing tall towers.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-10-14T13:45:50-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-157", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/developments/2014/10/14/space-shift-as-wealthiest-flock-to-supertall-condos-offices-go-horizontal/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-DVB-22450", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Real Estate", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "An inversion is going on in the real estate world: the wealthy are clamoring to buy glassy apartments that soar high in the skyline, while the fastest growing companies are demanding spacious low-slung buildings and eschewing tall towers.", "title": "Space Shift: As Wealthiest Flock to Supertall Condos, Offices Go Horizontal", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/developments/2014/10/14/space-shift-as-wealthiest-flock-to-supertall-condos-offices-go-horizontal/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Developments", "article.id": "BL-DVB-22450", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-10-14T15:25:02-04:00"}, "article_summary": "For most of their history, skyscrapers in major cities like New York were first and foremost office buildings.\nBut the crowning of the 104-unit tower\u2014which hosts a $95 million penthouse\u2014marks more than just the latest of the super-tall condos for the ultra-rich.\nIt just takes dozens of wealthy families to make up one of the tallest buildings in the world.\nBut if nothing else, the trend is dramatically changing what it takes to leave a mark on the skyline of Manhattan.\nWhile an office tower of that size could rise higher than 20 floors, Facebook\u2019s building is merely a single floor, stretched out over one-third of a mile, the size of seven football fields."}
