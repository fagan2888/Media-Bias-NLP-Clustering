Bloomberg News\n\nA year and a half after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe launched his program to end Japan\u2019s long slump, a number of economists are turning skeptical about prospects for success. One remaining optimist \u2014 albeit with some caveats \u2014 is Adam Posen, president of the Washington D.C.-based Peterson Institute for International Economics, and a long-time student of Japanese economics and finance. He also sits on the panel of economic advisers to the U.S. Congressional Budget Office and is a former member of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal sat down with Mr. Posen in Tokyo recently to get his assessment of how the \u201cAbenomics\u201d experiment is working.\n\nThe gist of Mr. Posen\u2019s argument is that despite some short-term setbacks, there are plenty of positive signs Japan is on track to return to steady growth and end deflation. But progress will be slow and unsteady, in part because he believes Japan must balance its growth strategy with a plan to curb its debt.\n\nCurrent disappointment is partly the fault of the \u201cspin\u201d that higher prices would lead to a self-reinforcing cycle of higher wages, spending, and investment, he said. \u201cIt would be nice to have. But it wasn\u2019t virtuous cycle or death spiral. We\u2019re out of the death spiral. That\u2019s good.\u201d\n\nHere are edited excerpts from the interview:\n\nWSJ: Many economists say the hit from the April 1 sales tax increase was greater than expected, and potentially debilitating for the economy. What do you think?\n\nMr. Posen: The question is, does this say something about the underlying trend being weaker? And does this one data point show that Japan is suffering a serious short-term problem? I think the answer to both is no. This is well within the range of variation of what happens in a normal economy.\n\nMost importantly, while this is a slowdown, we\u2019re still talking positive growth. Japan has to start comparing itself in some ways to Europe. When Spain and Ireland did serious fiscal consolidation, they suffered through a few years of negative growth.\n\nWSJ: Is there a danger the economy can\u2019t withstand the tax hike?\n\nMr. Posen: When I think about an economy not withstanding it, I mean an economy being thrown from a growth period into a recession, financial firms being thrown from profitable into fragile, employment declining. And none of that\u2019s happening in Japan \u2026 I think people are overreacting.\n\nWSJ: One source of concern is that wage increases aren\u2019t keeping pace with inflation, threatening to dampen consumption.\n\nMr. Posen: A lot of us came out early in 2013 and tried to tell the public and the government that they had to get wages up \u2026 And the government tried. It didn\u2019t happen. So of course things are worse than they would have been if they had \u2026 There has to be renewed pressure on corporate Japan to give decent wage increases in the next year.\n\nWSJ: Another worry has been the surprising weakness in exports.\n\nMr. Posen: That to me is the troubling part of this \u2014 that we saw the massive depreciation of the yen \u2026 and we\u2019re just not seeing the response in exports. Now I think this is potentially a structural problem\u2026\n\nWSJ: Do you think the Bank of Japan is on track to meet its target of 2% inflation in two years?\n\nMr. Posen: I do. I am convinced that on a nominal basis, the BOJ will deliver something close to 2% inflation. Maybe it\u2019s going to be 1.7 or 1.8 instead of 2. Maybe it will take another few months to get to 2 \u2026 Inflation is on an upward trend. More importantly, inflation expectations are on an upward trend. They don\u2019t need to drastically intervene in the economy to further stimulate growth, because growth isn\u2019t that bad\u2026\n\nWSJ: So with weak wages and weak exports, does it make sense to go ahead with the planned tax increase next year?\n\nMr. Posen: The issue is, unfortunately, grit your teeth and bear it\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s ultimately just a reality that while you\u2019re paying down the debt, or paying for the social welfare state you\u2019ve got, growth isn\u2019t going to be that fast.\n\nWSJ: What\u2019s the risk to not raising taxes?\n\nMr. Posen: Usually when a country is seen as being on a less fiscally sustainable or less fiscally credible path than it used to be, you crash the currency.\n\nWSJ: Isn\u2019t that what Japan wants?\n\nMr. Posen: They will discover if that happens isn\u2019t really what they want \u2026 The export response to a decline in the yen is much less than it used to be. If you care about real incomes, a significant decline in yen will be inflationary and will further erode real incomes \u2026 Third, we know that Japan\u2019s importing an awful lot of energy now. And this is just going to make that harder to pay for and more painful.\n\nWSJ: So what do you think is going right, right now?\n\nMr. Posen: You\u2019re seeing a tightening of the labor market. You\u2019re seeing a very large surge in female labor force participation. You\u2019re seeing inflation expectations on many measures rising. You\u2019re seeing growth remaining positive.\n\nSo all of that\u2019s going right. It\u2019s just not going well. That\u2019s what happens when you run out of room\u2026\n\nJapan is not Greece. It\u2019s not going to end with Japan hitting a wall. It\u2019s just things are going to be less pleasant for a while\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s partly the fault of the spin that everybody talked about the virtuous cycle (of higher inflation leading to higher wages, spending, investment, etc.) It would be nice to have. But it wasn\u2019t virtuous cycle or death spiral. We\u2019re out of the death spiral.
