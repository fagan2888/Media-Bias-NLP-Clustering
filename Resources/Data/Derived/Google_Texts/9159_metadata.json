Given the fact that 87% are getting taxpayer subsidies, that means plenty of them find even subsidized ObamaCare plans too expensive.\n\nMeanwhile, 42% of enrollees say they had trouble paying out-of-pocket costs. That\u2019s only slightly better than the 44% of the uninsured who had trouble paying those bills.\n\nAnd just 16% of ObamaCare enrollees say they \u201cfeel financially prepared to handle future health care costs.\u201d That, too, is only slightly better than the uninsured, 12% of whom feel this way.\n\nYes, roughly 12 million signed up for an ObamaCare plan this year. But that\u2019s less than the 15 million who were buying individual insurance policies on their own \u2014 without billions in taxpayer subsidies \u2014 before ObamaCare.\n\nAs far as \u201cgood\u201d goes, ObamaCare seems a long way from it.\n\nFollow John Merline on Twitter: @IBD_JMerline.", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama once said about ObamaCare that, \"The health insurance that's being provided is good.
