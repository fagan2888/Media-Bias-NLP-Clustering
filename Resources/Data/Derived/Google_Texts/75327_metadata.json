National winds are blowing against Democrats, and Shaheen faces a potential challenge from former Massachusetts senator Scott Brown, who has already pulled off one now-legendary upset.\n\nBrown, who announced an exploratory committee last Friday, has pounced on Shaheen\u2019s vote in favor of the Affordable Care Act, tried to frame her as an \u201cObama Democrat,\u201d and said she is disconnected from the concerns of her constituents.\n\nShaheen and her Democratic allies believe that her decades-long foundation in New Hampshire will help insulate her from Republican attacks and the potentially nasty political climate forecasters say the Democrats are likely to face in November.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been frenetically going around New Hampshire for the last 5\u00bd years, working on the issues that matter to the people of this state, and I don\u2019t intend to change that,\u201d Shaheen told reporters after talking with the students at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at St. Anselm College.\n\nBut that hard work and Shaheen\u2019s stature may not be enough if Brown, a seasoned candidate familiar with the spotlight of two nationally watched campaigns, makes his bid official, as both Democrats and Republicans expect him to do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis foray has already heartened members of the GOP, eager to wrest control of the Senate from Democrats. Republicans reason that a Brown candidacy would, at least, force Democrats to spend heavily there, drawing resources from other races.\n\nBrown\u2019s strategy, people close to him say, centers on trying to depict Shaheen as disconnected from workaday New Hampshire residents and shackling her not only to the most unpopular elements of Obama\u2019s record, including the health care law, but to the president himself.\n\nAfter Obama praised Shaheen in a televised NECN interview Wednesday, Brown hit back.\n\n\u201cPresident Obama and Jeanne Shaheen are joined at the hip,\u201d Brown said in a statement Thursday. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for Jeanne Shaheen, Obamacare would not have become the law of the land.\u201d\n\nThe troubled implementation of the Affordable Care Act is just one part of a darkening electoral picture for Democrats.\n\n\u201cThe national environment is not helpful at this time,\u201d said former US senator Bob Graham, a Florida Democrat. \u201cThe president\u2019s approval levels, the consternation about Obamacare, all of the uncertainties around the world are challenges.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, Shaheen would still enter the general election with several advantages, if Brown wins the GOP primary against a field that includes former US senator Bob Smith, former state senator Jim Rubens, and conservative activist Karen Testerman.\n\nShaheen is a popular member of one of the state\u2019s most prominent political families, her husband a decades-long powerbroker in state politics. She has won statewide campaigns four times, with just one loss: the 2002 US Senate race won by Republican John E. Sununu.\n\nA Suffolk University poll released earlier this month showed that Brown, who lost in Massachusetts two years ago despite strong favorability ratings, would enter the race with more Granite Staters viewing him negatively than positively. That poll gave Shaheen a lead of 52 percent to 39 percent in a hypothetical matchup.\n\nDemocrats have already begun to paint Brown as a political opportunist, an office-shopper eager to trade on the celebrity he earned in 2010 by winning the Massachusetts seat opened by Senator Edward M. Kennedy\u2019s death, and as someone more concerned with his career than with serving constituents.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got Jeanne Shaheen, who has fought long and hard for the people of New Hampshire, and you\u2019ve got Scott Brown, who has flirted with every office imaginable,\u201d said Ty Matsdorf, an adviser to Senate Majority PAC, a political action committee that supports Democratic candidates.\n\nIn turn, Brown has tried to jiu-jitsu that line of attack. On Tuesday, he called the carpetbagger label derogatory and insulting to many New Hampshire residents who have moved from other states.\n\nBoth Shaheen and Brown may soon be buffeted by factors beyond their control. Brown\u2019s refusal to sign a pact limiting outside spending virtually ensures that the state will be deluged by millions of dollars in advertising paid for by groups not directly affiliated with either campaign.\n\nA number of national Democratic strategists acknowledge that a Shaheen-Brown race would be competitive and that Shaheen could be dragged down by the president\u2019s low approval ratings.\n\nBut these strategists argued that her long tenure in the state \u2014 as a former state lawmaker and, in particular, as governor for six years \u2014 will help insulate her from a national environment that currently favors Republicans. They were bullish she will be victorious come November.\n\n\u201cIn a state like New Hampshire, where someone like Jeanne Shaheen has been so deeply involved for so long, the environment doesn\u2019t affect her as much,\u201d said Democratic pollster Mark Mellman. \u201cPeople know her well, know what she\u2019s been doing.\u201d\n\nBrown strategists, though, note that the voter enrollment numbers that doomed him in Massachusetts against Elizabeth Warren in 2012 are more favorable for him north of the border.\n\nIn New Hampshire, Republicans hold a 3-point edge over Democrats in registered voters. In Massachusetts in 2012, registered Democrats outnumbered Republicans by more than 3 to 1. Unenrolled voters account for the largest bloc in both states.\n\nThe New Hampshire enrollment figures mean that Brown could lose independents, draw no Democratic support, and still win. That\u2019s a stark difference from Massachusetts two years ago, when he needed to win unenrolled voters and pick off a chunk of Democrats.\n\nBoth Shaheen\u2019s effort to curb outside spending, and Brown\u2019s resistance, are strategic. Nationally, outside groups supporting Republicans are expected to outspend Democrats heavily in this election cycle. That represents a political dislocation, as state borders blur and national influences in statewide races grow.\n\nThe chance the race will be shaped by broader forces is increased by the election\u2019s spot on the calendar. New Hampshire, as it does every four years by dint of its status hosting the first presidential primary, will again become a focus of presidential campaign interest, with candidates from both parties ramping up visits to the state.\n\nPerhaps more than in past years, White House hopefuls will find a state already being shaped by the political zeitgeist beyond its borders.\n\n\u201cThere are very few places that buck national trends anymore,\u201d said Republican pollster Whit Ayres. \u201cAlmost all politics is national now. New Hampshire will not escape the national mood.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "3.2.3126492377", "eomportal-id": 82208, "description": "Jeanne Shaheen stood in a college auditorium Tuesday, her political pedigree staring down from the walls around her: An oversized snapshot of her and her husband with Jimmy Carter; Shaheen sitting next to presidential hopeful Gary Hart.
