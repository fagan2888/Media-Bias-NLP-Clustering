of Commerce is forming a potentially powerful new business partnership with West Africa to strengthen trade and investment ties.\n\nThe alliance links the Chamber with the 15-nation Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), creating the U.S. \u2014 ECOWAS Business Initiative (USEBI) \u2014 the first effort of its kind in the region \u2014 as part of an effort to churn up large-scale economic growth and improve security throughout the burgeoning area.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cBy bringing new jobs to the market, you alleviate a lot of concerns and will help bolster security and peace in the region, and that\u2019s part of what we\u2019re thinking through as we engage there,\u201d Scott Eisner, the Chamber\u2019s vice president of African Affairs, told reporters Friday.\n\nThe U.S. and African trading relationship can blossom through improved trade facilitation, supply-chain and transportation development and growing the manufacturing base, Eisner said.\n\nHe said the U.S. and West African private-sector business groups, including the Federation of West Africa Chamber of Commerce and Industry, agreed that now is the time to take the reins and promote far-reaching investment ahead of government efforts to jump-start the region's massive economic potential or risk losing a global competitive edge.\n\nIn turn, business and the U.S. government will work \u201chand-and-glove\u201d to develop these regional markets with the goal of lowering trade barriers and increasing competition, Eisner said.\n\nOne of the aims is to bring more stability to the region and provide an economic framework that mutes government corruption and bureaucratic red tape that can make U.S. investment difficult.\n\nBurkina Faso, one of the countries in the group, experienced a coup Wednesday that has led to demonstrations and riots and has been condemned by the United States and France, among other nations.\n\nEarlier this summer, President Obama signed the 10-year African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), which provides 39 African nations with tariff-free access to U.S. markets.\n\nPassage of that bill spurred the Chamber and its partners to pick up the pace of their efforts in West Africa, Eisner said.\n\nU.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman Michael FromanObama administration strikes deal on TPP data storage White House developing

the elimination of tariffs under AGOA won\u2019t be enough to fully stoke the U.S.-Africa trading relationship.\n\nThe future of the partnership will depend more on \u201cprograms that can support Africa\u2019s own priorities and help build the continent\u2019s capacity to trade competitively in the 21st century global economy,\u201d Froman said during the AGOA trade summit in Gabon in August.\n\nOther goals in West Africa include developing the retail and agricultural sectors, expanding access to the Internet and generating a consistent power supply.\n\nThe formal kick-off for the partnership will be held Sept. 29 in New York.\n\nThe ECOWAS countries beside Burkina Faso are Benin, Cabo Verde, Cote D\u2019Ivoire, The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Togo.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The business partnership aims to strengthen trade and investment ties with the region.", "description": "The
