Whether fantasy sports leagues are predominantly won by skill or luck is taking on new meaning in Kansas as the state's attorney general investigates their legality.

Attorney General Derek Schmidt could determine them to be primarily games of chance, and therefore illegal under the Kansas constitution. The constitution only allows the state to administer games that fit a broad definition of lottery.

Players compete in fantasy leagues by drafting digital teams using data from real athletes, and then tracking their performance during real games. Leagues and fantasy sports websites often give cash prizes to the best performing teams.

Republican Rep. Mark Kahrs from Wichita has asked the attorney general to weigh on the categorization as a bill defining fantasy sports as legal games of skill moves through the Legislature.
