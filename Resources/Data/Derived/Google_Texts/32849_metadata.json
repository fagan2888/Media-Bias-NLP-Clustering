She settled a civil case against Cosby for an undisclosed sum in 2006.\n\nThe Massachusetts civil lawsuit against Cosby was filed in December 2014 by Tamara Green, later joined by six other women, who contend that Cosby sexually assaulted or abused them, that each publicly accused Cosby, and Cosby responded by calling the women liars, thus defaming them, court documents said.\n\nU.S. Magistrate Judge David Hennessy also rejected arguments by Camille Cosby that she lacked any first-hand knowledge of the events at issue, and that the court should protect her from \"unnecessary harassment\" by limiting the scope of the subpoena.\n\nLawyers for Bill Cosby plan to appeal Hennessy's ruling, according to the New York Times.\n\nCosby sent a Twitter message on Thursday afternoon saying: \"Friends and fans, Thank You.\" Some responded with messages of support, noting he was innocent until proven guilty. Others showed scorn, asking: \"What about the victims?\" and \"What 'fans'?\"\n\n(Reporting by Mary Wisniewski in Chicago; Editing by Peter Cooney)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A federal magistrate judge in Massachusetts on Thursday rejected arguments by Cosby's", "title": "Bill Cosby's wife must testify in civil case against him, judge rules", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/01/01/Bill-Cosbys-wife-must-testify-civil-case-against-him-judge-rules", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/people-cosby_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/01/01/Bill-Cosbys-wife-must-testify-civil-case-against-him-judge-rules", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/people-cosby_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "A federal magistrate judge in Massachusetts on Thursday rejected arguments by Cosby's", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "A federal magistrate judge in Massachusetts on Thursday rejected arguments by Cosby's wife of almost 52 years, who also has been his business manager, that the deposition would represent an \"undue burden.\"\nThe charge stems from accusations by Andrea Constand, 44, a former basketball team manager at Temple University in Philadelphia, Cosby's alma mater.\nShe settled a civil case against Cosby for an undisclosed sum in 2006.\nLawyers for Bill Cosby plan to appeal Hennessy's ruling, according to the New York Times.\nCosby is free on $1 million bail, and his lawyer has said the entertainer is not guilty and will not consider a plea bargain."}
