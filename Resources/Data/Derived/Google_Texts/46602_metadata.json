This year\u2019s midterms will go down as the most expensive in history, with both parties spending a combined total of $4 billion. The parties shelled out nearly $700 million on the 36 Senate races alone, most of which went toward ads that tapped into hot-button issues like health care, abortion or general anti-incumbent fervor.\n\nAttack ads played an outsized role in some of the most hotly contested races. Some of them hit wildly below the belt, while others were simply bizarre or (unintentionally) hilarious. But the most pointed negative messages helped bury candidates, many of them Democrats. Here\u2019s a look at the ads that helped sway several key Senate races.\n\nWhat Rhymes With Alison Lundergan Grimes\n\nWhen Alison Lundergan Grimes won the Democratic nomination in Kentucky this May, it seemed she might actually have a chance at dethroning Mitch McConnell. But Grimes came off as amateurish\u2014despite her attempts to sell herself as a gun lover and fervent supporter of Big Coal\u2014and in July McConnell hobbled her candidacy for good with one of the strangest attack ads in recent memory. It\u2019s an earworm set to auto-tune, laid over stock footage and DIY graphics. The song\u2019s chorus is \u201cWhat rhymes with Alison Lundergan Grimes?\u201d and the answers, in no particular order, are \u201cnot ready for prime time,\u201d \u201csticks to party line\u201d and \u201cleft-wing mime.\u201d\n\nMcConnell painted her as a classic liberal attached to the policies of President Obama, who is especially unpopular in Kentucky. The ad was viewed more than 600,000 times, and this fall, when Grimes refused to say whether or not she voted for Obama in 2012, it only reaffirmed McConnell\u2019s message.\n\nUploaded By: Mitch McConnell\n\nNice Guy\n\nHeading into Election Day, Colorado Democrat Mark Udall was locked in a dead heat with his challenger, Representative Cory Gardner. But Gardner may have gained an edge in September with a genre-bending spot that exploited the state\u2019s cowboy streak. Gardner calls Udall \u201ca real nice guy\u201d before stating, \u201cHe\u2019s a nice guy who\u2019ll never change the Senate. He is the Senate.\u201d Ouch. Gardner goes even further, noting that Udall\u2019s father \u201cran for president,\u201d while his owner father sells tractors, \u201cjust like my granddad.\u201d\n\nA furious Udall complained to The Denver Post that his family should be off-limits, which only helped generate more attention for the spot. It became the most popular of Gardner\u2019s campaign and was viewed online tens of thousands of times.\n\nUploaded By: Cory Gardner for Senate\n\nTell Kay Hagan Obamacare Hurts North Carolina\n\nThe Senate seat of North Carolina Democrat Kay Hagan was considered vulnerable almost a year before the midterm elections, and Republicans pounced early. Americans for Prosperity, a conservative nonprofit, released an emotional ad in January featuring a woman explaining how she lost her health insurance because of the Affordable Care Act. Hagan had echoed President Obama\u2019s promise that if you liked your plan, you could keep it. The woman in the spot drives the contradiction home, saying that the senator had lied to her, and now she had to pay more for health coverage. The ad, which was viewed more than half a million times, had a long life span and followed Hagan to the polls, where she came up short.\n\nUploaded By: Americans For Prosperity\n\nForce\n\nNew Hampshire Senator Jeanne Shaheene remained locked in a tight race last month with her Republican challenger, Scott Brown, a carpetbagger former senator from Massachusetts. That\u2019s when she released an ad that tied Brown to the Republican\u2019s \u201cwar on women.\u201d Called \u201cForce,\u201d it revealed that Brown\u2014who depicted himself as pro-choice\u2014once supported a bill that would have required women to look at color photographs of developing fetuses before receiving an abortion.\n\nBrown claimed the ad was false and demanded it be taken down, but PolitiFact, the fact-checking website, deemed it \u201cmostly true.\u201d Regardless, the in-your-face spot, which was viewed tens of thousands of times in the weeks before the election, crippled Brown\u2019s campaign.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "attack ads, senate, midterms, what rhymes with alison lundergan grimes, nice guy, mark udall, cory gardner, kay hagan obamacare, joni ernst squeal, jeanne shaheene force", "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "outbrain": {"image": "http://media.vocativ.com/photos/2015/04/Political-Attack-Ads-Poster23357848582.jpg", "title": "The Attack Ads That Swung the Senate"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Attack Ads That Swung the Senate", "creator": "@mikespiesnyc", "image": {"src": "https://media.vocativ.com/photos/2014/11/Political-Attack-Ads-Poster21366538606.jpg"}, "title": "These Are the Attack Ads That Gave Us a Republican Senate", "site": "@vocativ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "og": {"url": "http://www.vocativ.com/usa/us-politics/attack-ads-swung-senate/", "image": {"width": 560, "secure_url": "https://media.vocativ.com/photos/2014/11/Political-Attack-Ads-Poster21366538606.jpg", "identifier": "http://media.vocativ.com/photos/2014/11/Political-Attack-Ads-Poster21366538606.jpg", "height": 292}, "type": "article", "description": "We break down five TV ads that transformed hotly contested races", "title": "These Are the Attack Ads That Gave Us a Republican Senate"}, "fb": {"app_id": 685756558116580}, "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "We break down five TV ads that transformed hotly contested races."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8225\"", "article_summary": "Attack ads played an outsized role in some of the most hotly contested races.\nHere\u2019s a look at the ads that helped sway several key Senate races.\nGardner calls Udall \u201ca real nice guy\u201d before stating, \u201cHe\u2019s a nice guy who\u2019ll never change the Senate.\nThe parties shelled out nearly $700 million on the 36 Senate races alone, most of which went toward ads that tapped into hot-button issues like health care, abortion or general anti-incumbent fervor.\nShareTweetShareSendLinkThe results are in, and as predicted, the GOP has regained control of the Senate."}
