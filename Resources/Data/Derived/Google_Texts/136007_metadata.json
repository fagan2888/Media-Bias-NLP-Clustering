This weekend, Marcie Bianco wrote that the birth control market is\u2014what else?\u2014even more sexist than you think.\n\nShe opens with a comedy video from Buzzfeed (now there\u2019s a font of deep cultural analysis) that purports to illustrate that \u201csociety places the burden of birth control on women rather than men,\u201d whose condoms just don\u2019t come with the cost and \u201ccultural stigmas\u201d of female birth-control options:\n\nThe justification process alone \u2014 to parents, the medical establishment and to one\u2019s partner \u2014 is exhausting and intimidating. It is also a costly process. As the medical assistant notes in the video, upon the guy\u2019s admission that he doesn\u2019t have health insurance, \u201cThat will be $150. I hope it\u2019s worth it.\u201d That women have to justify the need for birth control at all reveals the wild, sexist hypocrisy pervading American culture: On one hand, women are responsible for \u201ctaking care of the situation,\u201d while simultaneously fighting all the legal and societal preventative measures \u2014 from gawking comments about one\u2019s sexual habits to the increasingly limited and cost prohibitive access thanks to Congress and the courts \u2014 in place that make it frustratingly difficult to procure said contraceptives. [\u2026] Now, if buying female birth control was like buying condoms, there would be no need to \u201cbuy\u201d at all. Women simply would go to any clinic or school nurse\u2019s office or nightclub and reach her hand into a basket for a \u201cfree\u201d tablet.\n\nWhere to begin? Probably with a warning to any Hunter College parents: they hired the author of this crap to teach your kids, so you should probably ask for a refund.\n\nOne Mic commenter put Dr. Bianco\u2019s first glaring logical fallacy succinctly:\n\nDo you really compare birth control pills- pills that change the hormonal balance of your body, that are body specific and can be seriously dangerous, with condoms, a piece of rubber meant for external usage? Are we really at this stage of stupid?\n\nYes, S.R. Berr. Yes we are.\n\nSecond, there\u2019s the small matter of sex being a two-person activity. Talk of any given birth control method only being \u201cfor\u201d one partner is silly, considering both of them are presumably trying to avoid pregnancy. Yes, because the resulting child develops in the woman\u2019s body it\u2019s easier for the man to abandon them, but you don\u2019t need birth control to understand that having sex with deadbeat slime is a really bad idea\u2014and if you lack that common sense, no pill is going to give it to you.\n\nThird, no contraceptive whine-fest is complete without swipes at Rush Limbaugh for calling Sandra Fluke a slut and Hobby Lobby for asserting their basic freedom not to pay for products that kill embryonic human beings.\n\nYes, for the millionth time, Rush was wrong and apologized. But he was not simply \u201cgawking at her sexual habits\u201d but at her desire to legally force her sense of entitlement on everyone else. And if we\u2019re to be endlessly browbeaten with one mean thing one commentator said about one liberal, then shouldn\u2019t we expect in return an apology or two for the countless personal attacks they\u2019ve levied against pro-life Americans and faith-based organizations? Like, for example, Bianco\u2019s own suggestion that Hobby Lobby was limiting employees\u2019 \u201caccess\u201d to birth control as if they didn\u2019t already cover 80% of the methods ObamaCare wanted covered, and were somehow stopping workers from purchasing the rest rather than merely not paying for it themselves.\n\nAlso, while I have reservations about the details, it\u2019s worth noting that Republicans are increasingly interested in making oral contraceptives over-the-counter, which would alleviate much of the cost and hassle the author laments\u2014yet it\u2019s the pro-choice, pro-contraception establishment standing in their way.\n\nBut Bianco\u2019s biggest fallacy? It\u2019s not \u201cthe wild, sexist hypocrisy pervading American culture,\u201d but that pervading America\u2019s casual-sex subculture\u2014a world created by her own ideological predecessors and deified by her own ideological contemporaries. The blame for its associated indignities lies squarely with them, not with those of us who have been advocating sexual responsibility all along.\n\nInstead of looking for scapegoats for the fact that the reality of the Sexual Revolution doesn\u2019t match the dream, how about left-feminists start reassessing their priorities? They could start by acknowledging that those of us they\u2019ve spilled so much ink demonizing as patriarchal, theocratic killjoys just might be on to something after all.\n\nYes, foregoing sex until marriage denies you lots of immediate gratification. But gratification is hardly a need, and treating sex with the mature, honest seriousness it deserves also spares you a litany of life-changing complications and hardships\u2014medical, emotional, social, economic, and parental. Try as we might, society just can\u2019t seem to conquer sex\u2019s innate power to change an entire lifetime, so isn\u2019t it simple common sense to save it for someone you can trust to share a lifetime with? Isn\u2019t a little delayed satisfaction now a fair tradeoff for stability and peace of mind later?\n\nWinston Churchill once said, \u201cThe inherent vice of capitalism is the unequal sharing of blessings. The inherent virtue of Socialism is the equal sharing of miseries.\u201d That\u2019s the only sort of equality the left\u2019s sexual ethos has any chance of bringing women.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Live Action News", "description": "19 Like17 Tweet1 +11The Cult of Contraception doesn\u2019t exactly enjoy an overabundance of brain power, but when it comes to truly insipid commentary, PolicyMic has always been in a league of its own.
