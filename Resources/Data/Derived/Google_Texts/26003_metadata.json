The toddler, Ana Paula, born conjoined at the pelvis with her twin sister \u2014 a condition known as ischiopagus \u2014 was left with three legs, three kidneys, and various reproductive tissues after her other half did not survive the separation surgery. Now, with the help of Children of War Foundation, a non-profit, Ana Paula and her mother, Ileana Monrroy, were flown from rural Panama to Los Angeles to seek surgeries to help her be healthy and learn how to walk.\n\n\u201cI think she\u2019ll be very functional as a walker, at the very least with crutches or with the arm crutches or something similar,\u201d said Dr. Phoebe Scott-Wyard, who works at the Shriners Hospital for Children in Los Angeles, where the procedure is set to be carried out, CBS LA reported. The surgical treatment plan for the toddler includes removing her middle leg, and amputate her right leg from above the knee since it does not have a functional knee or foot. Ana Paula will then be fitted with a prosthetic and will hopefully be able to walk.\n\nThe prosthetics will play a pivotal role when it comes time for the toddler to walk at some point. Despite the corrective surgery, the toddler will not be able to run and play like other children. \u201c[B]ut she will be able to move about, be able to keep up with her peers and be able to have a childhood and hopefully a very good adult life as well,\u201d reassured Dr. Kit Song, chief of staff at Shriners Hospital for Children in Los Angeles.\n\nMonrroy, optimistic about Ana Paula\u2019s upcoming surgeries, said through a translator: \u201cWell, my hope is that she will be fine and she will do well with her health \u2026 and she will also be able to walk,\u201d the Daily Mail reported. The toddler\u2019s scheduled to have her first surgery in a month, after doctors come up with a through medical plan for the three-legged girl. It will most likely be a month before she has her first surgery.\n\nAna Paula\u2019s case is so unique that there are only 12 survivable cases like it in the world annually. In 2011, an Indian toddler, Lakshmi Tatma, successfully had a 27-hour operation to remove her \u201cparasitic twin,\u201d that originally left her with four arms and four legs. Like Monrroy, Tatma was born with the rare condition ischiopagus, meaning twins can share two legs, three legs \u2014 with the third often being two fused legs \u2014 or four legs. However, Lakshmi\u2019s conjoined twin stopped developing in the mother\u2019s womb, with a torso and limbs, but no head. The twin was joined to Lakshmi at the pelvis.\n\nOne in 100,000 live births, and one in 10 conjoined twin births are affected by ischiopagus with separation being the only treatment for the rare condition.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "ana paula, panama, los angeles, conjoined twins, three legs, ischiopagus, corrective surgeries, reconstructive surgeries, walk, healthy, prosthetic, children of war foundation", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Panamanian toddler Ana Paula, born as a conjoined twin, arrived in Los Angeles for several reconstructive surgeries, including one for her three legs.", "title": "Three-Legged Toddler To Have Life-Changing Surgery [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/ana-paulatoddler-born-conjoined-twin-set-have-corrective-surgery-her-3-legs-290388", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/27/girl-three-legs-set-have-corrective-surgery.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Panamanian toddler Ana Paula, born as a conjoined twin, arrived in Los Angeles for several reconstructive surgeries, including one for her three legs.", "title": "Three-Legged Toddler To Have Life-Changing Surgery [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/ana-paulatoddler-born-conjoined-twin-set-have-corrective-surgery-her-3-legs-290388", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/27/girl-three-legs-set-have-corrective-surgery.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/27/girl-three-legs-set-have-corrective-surgery.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Conditions", "published_time": "2014-06-27T17:07:19-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-01T11:54:24-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Panamanian toddler Ana Paula, born as a conjoined twin, arrived in Los Angeles for several reconstructive surgeries, including one for her three legs."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe49af\"", "article_summary": "A 22-month-old girl from Panama has arrived in Los Angeles, Calif., to undergo life-changing surgery after being born as a conjoined twin.\nHowever, Lakshmi\u2019s conjoined twin stopped developing in the mother\u2019s womb, with a torso and limbs, but no head.\nLike Monrroy, Tatma was born with the rare condition ischiopagus, meaning twins can share two legs, three legs \u2014 with the third often being two fused legs \u2014 or four legs.\nOne in 100,000 live births, and one in 10 conjoined twin births are affected by ischiopagus with separation being the only treatment for the rare condition.\nThe toddler, Ana Paula, born conjoined at the pelvis with her twin sister \u2014 a condition known as ischiopagus \u2014 was left with three legs, three kidneys, and various reproductive tissues after her other half did not survive the separation surgery."}
