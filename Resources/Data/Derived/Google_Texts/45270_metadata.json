Ted Cruz of Texas, the Republican presidential candidate, received a hero\u2019s welcome at a Christian school here Thursday, pledging to uphold God and fundamental rights while dismissing rival Donald Trump as unelectable and Democratic hopefuls Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders as \u201cwild-eyed socialists.\u201d\n\nAbout 1,000 people packed the gym at Mekeel Christian Academy for the second visit this week to the Albany area by a presidential candidate. Hillary Clinton spoke at Cohoes High School on Monday, and Trump, Sanders and Republican Gov. John Kasich of Ohio are headed to the area next week, supporters say.\n\nThe April 19 New York primary could be key to deciding both parties\u2019 nominees, a sharp change from the past when the state\u2019s late voting was usually not a deciding factor. Cruz was in New York City Wednesday and was scheduled to return there following his Scotia speech to attend events in Brooklyn.\n\nWith students seated on a makeshift stage behind him, Cruz said the 2016 election will focus on \u201cjobs, freedom and security\u201d as he described an apocalyptic political landscape of national debt, eroding basic constitutional freedoms, and what he called the weak leadership of President Obama.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe also offered hope and encouragement, \u201cbecause people are waking up and help is on the way\u201d to change the status quo of drift and economic stagnation.\n\n\u201cThe media tries to tell us this is the new normal, this is as good as it gets,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cLet me tell you, that is an absolute lie.\u201d\n\nHe joked that the word politics derived from the word \u201cticks,\u201d comparing Washington, D.C., to \u201cblood-sucking parasites.\u201d He said \u201cfederal regulators have descended like locusts on small businesses.\u201d\n\nHe vowed \u201cto repeal every word of Obamacare\u201d and \u201cpass a simple flat tax where every American can fill out our taxes on a postcard.\u201d When that happens, \u201cwe should abolish the IRS.\u201d\n\nThe border will be secured and amnesty, sanctuary cities and welfare benefits for illegal aliens will cease, he said.\n\nWith such changes, \u201cit will be morning in America,\u201d he said, alluding to President Ronald Reagan\u2019s 1984 re-election campaign theme.\n\nHe cited Reagan for cutting taxes, rebuilding the military and defeating the Soviet Union in the Cold War. \u201cI intend to do the exact same thing with radical Islamic terrorism. ... We believe in peace through strength, but if and when military force is necessary, we should use overwhelming force, kill the enemy and then get the heck out.\u201d\n\nHe reserved his harshest rhetoric for describing the threat posted by the U.S. Supreme Court if liberal justices become the majority. He said \u201cwe are one liberal justice away\u201d from the Supreme Court \u201cstripping religious liberty from millions of Americans ... effectively erasing the Second Amendment from the Bill of Rights\u201d and subjugating national sovereignty to the United Nations and the World Court.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t pick Andrew Cuomo!\u201d a voice in the crowd yelled, prompting applause and Cruz to say, \u201cAll right, you convinced me.\u201d Cuomo, the New York governor, is a Democrat who supports Clinton.\n\nCruz said his chief GOP rival, Trump, \u201chas been supporting liberal Democratic politicians for 40 years\u201d and dismissed his claims to being a deal maker. He said Clinton will win if Trump is the nominee.\n\n\u201cI will not compromise away your religious liberty and I will not compromise away your Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms,\u201d he said.\n\nNominating Trump will guarantee a Clinton win and that \u201cis catastrophic. We lose the Supreme Court for a generation, we lose the Bill of Rights, our kids are buried in trillions more in debt, and we remain trapped in the same economic stagnation we\u2019ve seen in the past seven years.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur friends in the media tell us that Donald Trump is unstoppable in New York state,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cOddly enough, our friends in the media are comfortable with a New York liberal who has supported Andrew Cuomo, Hillary Clinton and Chuck Schumer for decades.\u201d\n\nHe closed by predicting \u201cthe most long lasting legacy of Barack Obama is going to be a new generation of leaders of the Republican Party who stand and fight for liberty, who stand and fight for the Constitution and who stand and fight for the Judeo-Christian values that built this great nation.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "News, Kingston news, NY news, US news, world news.", "title": "Cruz tells upstate NY crowd he\u2019ll get rid of Obamacare, IRS", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailyfreeman.com/general-news/20160407/cruz-tells-upstate-ny-crowd-hell-get-rid-of-obamacare-irs", "image": {"width": "960px", "identifier": "http://www.dailyfreeman.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/DF/20160407/NEWS/160409762/AR/0/AR-160409762.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "683px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Cruz tells upstate NY crowd he\u2019ll get rid of Obamacare, IRS"}, "twitter": {"domain": "dailyfreeman.com", "description": "SCOTIA >> U.S. Sen.
