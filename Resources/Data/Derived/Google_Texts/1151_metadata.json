The new agreement gives OHSU a year to do so.\n\nRobertson said there is a possibility OHSU could inject additional cash into Moda for additional stock, though he said that\u2019s likely a decision that wouldn\u2019t be made any time soon.\n\nOHSU likely would not take more than a 50 percent stake in the company.\n\n\u201cTwenty-five to 50 percent is probably the sweet spot,\u201d Robertson said. \u201cWe are in violent agreement (at OHSU) that we don\u2019t want to own an insurance company.\u201d\n\nModa borrowed $50 million from OHSU in December 2014. Since then, the Portland health insurance company has been hit by large financial losses that depleted its capital. Last month, the insurance rating firm A.M. Best placed the finances of Moda and its parent company \u201cunder review with negative implications.\u201d On Friday, Moda said it had borrowed an additional $50 million from its parent company to stabilize its financial condition.\n\nIn addition to Moda, PacificSource and other Oregon insurers have lost money in recent years as they struggle to figure out the significant changes wrought by the Affordable Care Act. Moda was forced to raise premiums 25 percent for 2016 for its customers in the individual market.\n\nModa contends its financial position is strong. In a prepared statement, Dr. William Johnson, president of Moda Health said of the OHSU announcement that the two companies have a longstanding relationship, and \u201cit makes perfect sense now that we move to deepen that partnership.\u201d\n\nRobertson said Monday he is satisfied that Moda is out of the financial woods.\n\n\u201cWe would not invest if we thought Moda was insolvent,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t think Moda is insolvent. The Oregon Insurance Commissioner doesn\u2019t think Moda is insolvent.\u201d\n\nRobertson said the deal is in keeping with OHSU\u2019s \u201claser-like focus\u201d on improving Oregonians\u2019 health.\n\nHe declined to release a copy of the letter of intent. Though the agreement has not been acted on yet, OHSU officials already describe the new relationship as a \u201cpartnership.\u201d They say the change is intended to improve patient care and protect the academic hospital\u2019s position in the state\u2019s increasingly tumultuous insurance market.\n\nAmid the uncertainty created by the advent of the Affordable Care Act, Oregon insurers are scrambling to create new alliances and shore up their competitive positions.\n\nIn addition to the OHSU-Moda deal, Legacy Health, operator of Legacy Emanuel Medical Center and five other metro-area hospitals, last month bought a 50 percent interest in PacificSource Health Plans for $100 million.\n\nRecently, one of the smaller Oregon insurers, Health Net, agreed to terms with national health insurance giant Centene, which is focused on Medicaid. Robertson said he expects more out-of-state firms to come into the market.\n\nModa remains one of the state\u2019s biggest insurers in the state. For OHSU, cementing its position with Moda can only help its bargaining position with other insurers.\n\nIn other states, specialist-heavy academic medical centers have been excluded from some insurers\u2019 provider networks to save money. OHSU faces similar hard-bargaining from insurers, Robertson acknowledged.\n\n\u201cThe threat that we see from this consolidation is that Oregonians might not have access to their state\u2019s academic health center,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we think that Oregonians deserve that access.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, OHSU entered into a partnership with Salem Health that fell just short of a merger. Under the name OHSU Partners, the two entities will \u201cmanage their respective clinical services as an integrated health system,\u201d according to a statement from OHSU. OHSU has also entered into a letter of intent for a similar affiliation with Tuality Healthcare.", "article_metadata": {"description": "PORTLAND \u2014 Oregon Health & Science University has agreed on terms with Moda Health Plan Inc. that allow the public entity to purchase a 25 percent share of the struggling insurer.
