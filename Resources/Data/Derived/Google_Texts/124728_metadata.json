Mike Modano was among the half-dozen honorees who will be inducted at the Toronto ceremonies in mid-November.\n\n\n\nAny mention of Modano can cause the bile to build toward Norm Green, the evil gent who announced the move of the North Stars to Dallas on March 10, 1993, with 16 games (including seven at home) remaining in a lost season.\n\n\n\nModano was 22 at the time. He was in his fourth season and already had 123 goals and 309 points when the moving vans headed to Dallas. He also was part of the improbable spring of 1991, when the North Stars squeezed into the playoffs with the 15th-most points in a 21-team league, and made it to the Stanley Cup Finals.\n\n\n\nWe loved Norm then, and we hated him later, but this can be said in retrospect:\n\n\n\nThe greatest thing to happen to Minnesota\u2019s sports scene in the past two-plus decades was Norm moving his hockey team to Dallas.\n\n\n\nThe politicians had no real appetite for building arenas and stadiums for our teams in March 1993. We had gotten away with contributing chump change to build Met Stadium, Met Center, the Civic Center, the Metrodome and Target Center.\n\n\n\nThen Norm left. Two years later, Minneapolis took over Target Center to facilitate the retention of the Timberwolves.\n\n\n\nIn 1998, the state came up with a no-interest loan of $65 million (of which a large share was forgiven) to build an arena in St. Paul as the needed home to get the NHL expansion Wild.\n\n\n\nIn 2006, the Legislature made a large state contribution to an on-campus home (TCF Bank Stadium) for the football Gophers and signed off on Hennepin County\u2019s involvement in building the Twins\u2019 spectacular Target Field.\n\n\n\nNow, we\u2019re giving a billion-dollar dome to the Vikings, fulfilling Mike Veeck\u2019s dream for an artsy ballyard in St. Paul, giving a face-lift to Target Center, and whispering about a soccer-specific stadium near Target Field for an MLS franchise.\n\n\n\nThanks, Norm. We might not have done any of this if you hadn\u2019t stolen away to Dallas with Modano.\n\n\n\nPLUS THREE FROM PATRICK\n\n\n\nNow that TC Bear has one, our teams need serious statue advice:\n\n\n\nTarget Field. Jim Kaat is No. 1 in Twins wins (189) and innings (2,966), and Kitty\u2019s pose on the mound would be wonderful in bronze.\n\n\n\nTarget Center (remodeled). Kevin Garnett will be Wolves\u2019 greatest player decades from now. Pose him to be eternally tossing resin on Sid\u2019s statue.\n\n\n\nTaj Ma Zygi (the new Vikings dome). Bud Grant, greatest coach, and Alan Page, greatest player. Statues should be placed far apart.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "The Hockey Hall of Fame announced its 2014 class this week.", "title": "Thank you, Norm Green, for moving North Stars", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/thank-you-norm-green-for-moving-north-stars/265105661/", "image": {"url": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201083", "width": 1680, "identifier": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201083", "height": 876}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "The Hockey Hall of Fame announced its 2014 class this week.", "title": "Thank you, Norm Green, for moving North Stars", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/thank-you-norm-green-for-moving-north-stars/265105661/", "image": {"src": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201083", "identifier": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201083"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "The Hockey Hall of Fame announced its 2014 class this week."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4156\"", "article_summary": "We had gotten away with contributing chump change to build Met Stadium, Met Center, the Civic Center, the Metrodome and Target Center.\nTwo years later, Minneapolis took over Target Center to facilitate the retention of the Timberwolves.\nTarget Center (remodeled).\nHe was in his fourth season and already had 123 goals and 309 points when the moving vans headed to Dallas.\nAny mention of Modano can cause the bile to build toward Norm Green, the evil gent who announced the move of the North Stars to Dallas on March 10, 1993, with 16 games (including seven at home) remaining in a lost season."}
