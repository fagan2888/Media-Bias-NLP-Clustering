Awa residents have asserted that they were afraid of hunting too far from their homes due to violent confrontations with loggers and ranchers in the past.\n\nBy January 14 the Brazilian Army had set up an office for FUNAI to deal with the illegal residents. Upon notification the residents have 40 days to leave the area voluntarily. Eligible small farm families will also receive assistance through Brazil\u2019s National Agrarian Reform Plan according to official notices.\n\nSI\u2019s campaign to remove the illegal operations started in April of 2012 and involved petitions to Brazilian authorities, international media coverage and formal requests to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights (IACHR).\n\nSI Director Stephen Corry said, \u201cThis is a momentous and potentially life-saving occasion for the Aw\u00e1. Their many thousands of supporters worldwide can be proud of the change they have helped the tribe bring about. But all eyes are now on Brazil to ensure it completes the operation before the World Cup kicks off in June, and protects Aw\u00e1 land once and for all.\u201d\n\nThe Aw\u00e1 people of northeastern Brazil are among the last nomadic hunter-gatherer tribes in the country and depend entirely on the rainforest. Close to 100 Aw\u00e1 have avoided contact with non-indigenous people.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Brazilian soldiers, police and other officials arrived in Aw\u00e1 territory in January to completely remove illegal loggers, ranchers and others.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "kpolisse", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/01/19/forced-eviction-underway-illegal-operations-awa-territory-153149", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/brazils_military_has_moved_in_to_stop_illegal_logging_-_courtesy_exercito_brasileiro_survival_international.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Forced Eviction Underway of Illegal Operations in Awa Territory"}, "dcterms.date": "2014-01-19T09:00-05:00", "dc": {"title": "Forced Eviction Underway of Illegal Operations in Awa Territory"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/01/19/forced-eviction-underway-illegal-operations-awa-territory-153149", "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Awa Territory, Brazilian Troops, Survival International, Illegal loggers, Human Rights, Indigenous Peoples, Awa People", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.title": "Forced Eviction Underway of Illegal Operations in Awa Territory"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9720\"", "article_summary": "Brazilian soldiers, police and other officials arrived in Aw\u00e1 territory in January to completely remove illegal loggers, ranchers and others from the area.\nBy January 14 the Brazilian Army had set up an office for FUNAI to deal with the illegal residents.\nAwa residents have asserted that they were afraid of hunting too far from their homes due to violent confrontations with loggers and ranchers in the past.\nSI\u2019s campaign to remove the illegal operations started in April of 2012 and involved petitions to Brazilian authorities, international media coverage and formal requests to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights (IACHR).\nThis latest operation comes after more than 30 percent of the Aw\u00e1 forest has already been destroyed."}
