BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee's mobile center will be in Chattanooga until April 30 to assist with special enrollment for health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, commonly called Obamacare.

Open enrollment ended Feb. 15. However, a special enrollment period is being offered through April 30.

Those who owe the tax fee for not having coverage in 2014 and missed the deadline for open enrollment qualify for the special enrollment period.

Other qualifying factors include getting married, having a baby, losing your previous health coverage—whether it's from a job, spouse or parent—and leaving incarceration.

BCBST will have bilingual insurance advisers available to explain eligibility and help with enrollment.

The mobile center will be at 271 Northgate Mall, in front of Old Navy. It will be open Tuesday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
