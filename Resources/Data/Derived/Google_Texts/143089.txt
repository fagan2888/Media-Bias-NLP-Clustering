Bernie Sanders may be the underdog in the 2016 race, but his healthcare plan is leading big time nationwide.

Out of the three remaining candidate’s healthcare proposals, Senator Sanders’ single-payer plan is the most appealing to voters.

From Politico:

“Asked their opinions of three separate scenarios for the future of Obamacare, 58 percent to 37 percent said they would like to see the 2010 health care law replaced with care for all, as advocated by Sanders. As far as flat out repealing the Affordable Care Act, which Donald Trump has vowed to do, 51 percent to 45 percent expressed support. And in terms of keeping the health care law as it is, just 48 percent said they would support that, while 49 percent said they would oppose. Hillary Clinton has by and large advocated for the law to remain in place as it currently exists.”

It is important to note that voters were not told which candidate supported which platform, though people who are well-versed in the election might have been able to deduce it anyway.

The poll was conducted with both Republicans and Democrats, as well as many independent voters. The majority of Republicans want Obamacare gone, while the majority of Democrats want it to stay put. Sanders’ proposal of replacing Obamacare with Medicaid-for-all is the reasonable compromise between these two viewpoints.
