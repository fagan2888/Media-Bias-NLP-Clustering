Their uninsured rate fell to 9.7 percent, almost 2 percentage points below the year before. The rate for all U.S. children fell to 6.0 percent from 7.1 percent.\n\nThe report released Friday was co-authored by the Georgetown University Health Policy Institute\u2019s Center for Children and Families and the National Council of La Raza, a civil rights and advocacy group for Hispanic Americans.\n\nOne reason for the improvement, researchers said, is that the Affordable Care Act produced opportunities for Hispanic adults to get health coverage, such as providing premium subsidies for buying health insurance in federal and state marketplaces and expanding Medicaid programs in many states. When parents enrolled, they generally signed up their children, too.\n\nStates that extended Medicaid to low-income adults had an average 7 percent uninsured rate for Hispanic children, about half the average 13.7 percent uninsured rate of states that did not expand Medicaid.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hispanic children are the fastest-growing segment of America's population.", "sailthru.expire_date": "2016-01-21 18:39:14 -0500", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "Hispanic children are the fastest-growing segment of America's population.", "title": "The Uninsured Rate For Hispanic Kids Has Hit A Historic Low.
