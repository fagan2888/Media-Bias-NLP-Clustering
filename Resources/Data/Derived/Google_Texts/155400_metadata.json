For example, there\u2019s no question it has made healthcare coverage affordable for millions who might otherwise have to go without. But what has that done to the waiting rooms in medical practices?Bill Thompson, a healthcare staffing expert and account representative at Health eCareers , says that, combined with personnel shortage, the extra patient load has driven stress levels to the max.\u201cHow many more patients are being treated now?\u201d Thompson asks, rhetorically. \u201cIt\u2019s like 2.5 million that have been added right away. Well, people and practices are feeling that additional stress.\u201dAnd some healthcare professionals, he adds, are beginning to look for greener pastures.A new study conducted by Health eCareers indicates that staff turnover is the greatest concern for healthcare recruiters in 2015. Nearly one-third of healthcare recruiters in the US rank employee turnover at the top of their issues list. And 43% say finding qualified talent is their greatest concern.\u201cAccording to the Bureau of Labor and Statistics, the healthcare unemployment rate is 3.5%,\u201d Thompson says. \u201cMany economists feel full healthcare employment is between 2% and 3%. So, this means we\u2019re very close to full employment.\u201dAnd that only magnifies the challenge because, as Thompson points out, the cost of staff turnover, combined with using recruiters to hire new staff is substantial.\u201cI can empathize with physicians running their practice and all of a sudden they lose a key person who is involved in patient care or involved in billing,\u201d Thompson says. \u201cAll of a sudden, [the physician is] working longer hours and losing money.\u201dSo, what\u2019s the strategy for physicians to employ? Thompson says the number one issue is retention. He points out that because most healthcare professionals are currently employed, as evidenced by the low unemployment figures, it\u2019s much more effective and efficient to invest in retention than to recruit and train new employees.\u201cThere\u2019s an abundance of things physicians can do,\u201d he says. \u201cSalary, vacation, personal time, recognition awards\u2014more and more practices are closed on Friday. There are many things they can do relative to improving their staff\u2019s quality of life.\u201dPart of that, he says, is branding. The Health eCareers survey found that nearly 80% of respondents believe an employer\u2019s brand and culture are important in retaining current and attracting new employees. A report by PricewaterhouseCoopers found that healthcare systems invest significantly less in HR programs than other industries, and Thompson says it\u2019s time for that to change.\u201cBranding is who you are,\u201d he points out. \u201cKeeping it consistent across all forms of media \u2026 that\u2019s what people are attracted to.\u201dWhen medical practices do need to invest in recruiting new talent, Thompson says the more time and effort the physician can put forth in finding the right match, the better off the practice will be. Too often physicians say, \u201cI need to get someone in here quick,\u201d as opposed to finding the right person.\u201cIt\u2019s much better to do your due diligence up front to ensure the right fit rather than coming back and having to go through the entire process again,\u201d Thompson says.But it\u2019s a tightrope, he says, with regard to not overpaying in what appears to be a buyer\u2019s market for healthcare professionals\u2014especially where hiring physician assistants is concerned.\u201cHospitals are trying to pull in as many (physician assistants) as they can, and individual practices are saying, \u2018We can\u2019t compete with the salaries they\u2019re offering the physician assistants,\u2019\u201d Thompson explains. \u201cThat\u2019s why medical practices need to look at what makes them unique. What can they offer that the hospital down the road cannot?\u201dIn the process of retaining and recruiting, however, Thompson says it\u2019s critical for physicians to be completely up front. He tells the story he heard from a physician whose practice has experienced very little turnover. The physician attributed that to being completely up front with candidates during the interviewing process.\u201cHe tells them, \u2018Listen, this is our organization. This is our culture. It may be a culture with a heavy duty work load, but this is who we are. So let\u2019s understand that right off the bat,\u2019\u201d Thompson explains. \u201cPeople are very mobile, and being cognizant of that helps in retaining and bringing in new talent. The more transparent you are, the more people appreciate that.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Affordable Care Act has helped millions of uninsured people gain health insurance, but it's also increased the burden on an already shorthanded industry.
