Together, we bring home about $7,000 a month, and we\u2019d really like to buy a house soon. Right now we have about $10,000 in debt on a boat along with ongoing stable bills, food and upkeep for our three horses. What price range of houses should we look at in our situation?\n\nHomeownership is a great goal, but first you two need to clean up your debt and build an emergency fund of three to six months of expenses. After that, I want you to save up enough for a down payment of at least 10 to 20 percent. When buying a home on a mortgage, I always recommend the monthly payments be no more than 25 percent of your monthly take-home pay on a 15-year, fixed-rate loan.\n\nNow, let\u2019s get to the other issues. You have some things in your life that are pulling at you financially. At some point, you may have to take a long look at the situation and ask the hard question, \u201cWhat is more important to me: horses and boats or homeownership?\u201d Getting rid of that boat, or finding new homes for one, two or all of your horses, would bring in some cash to put toward your debt and cut down on at least some of the animal maintenance.\n\nAnyway, that\u2019s how I would look at it. My wife and I are big fans of boats and horses. But we like boats more. One reason is because they don\u2019t eat as much! I can\u2019t get mad at you about either one, but right now you have three things pulling at you as financial priorities \u2014 homeownership, a boat and three horses. They\u2019re all pulling at you, and they\u2019re pulling at each other and limiting each other.\n\nOf course, you can always buy a lot less in a house. But what it really comes down to is what\u2019s most important to you. That\u2019s the big question, and it\u2019s one that only you can answer.\n\nI don\u2019t understand why you don\u2019t like it when people properly manage their credit cards and pay them off every month. By doing this, you pay no interest and in my case I even got a free trip to Europe from using my credit card. Please explain.\n\nI truly doubt that I can explain it to your satisfaction, but here goes. First, the credit card company did not give you a free trip to Europe. It\u2019s not going to lose money on transaction after transaction, year after year. The fallacy is that you feel as though you\u2019ve outsmarted a multibillion-dollar company that studies human behavior at incredible levels. You maybe, possibly came out ahead against it during that particular calendar year, but even that\u2019s debatable.\n\nOver the course of your life, you\u2019ll spend more when using credit cards as opposed to cash. There\u2019s plenty of research proving this to be fact. If you use a credit card repeatedly with the idea that you\u2019re getting a free trip to Europe because you\u2019re building up your miles, you spend more. An example would be McDonald\u2019s. When they started taking credit cards years ago, they found that the people using them spent 47 percent more.\n\nIn a good way, you are very unusual. You\u2019re not playing over in the stupid zone like most people who use credit cards. But both I and the credit card companies have found that, on average, your behavior would put you in a class of less than one-half of 1 percent of their customers. Can 0.5 percent of people handling snakes manage not to get bitten? Sure. But that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m going to start recommending snakes.\n\nDave Ramsey is a personal money management expert, author and national radio personality.
