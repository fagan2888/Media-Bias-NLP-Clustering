The sisters say government rules forcing to provide contraceptives and abortion-inducing drugs to their employees through health insurance are against the tenets of their faith.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nRichards said:\n\nIt\u2019s incredible to me that any employer in the 21st century would deny their employees access to birth control. This is the most commonly used prescription in the country. Upwards of 95 percent of women use birth control at some point in their lifetime. I\u2019m very proud of the fact that under President Obama and the Affordable Care Act, 55 million women, basically every woman who is insured, gets birth control covered at no co-pay. We are making such enormous strides. We are at a 30-year low for unintended pregnancy in the U.S., I believe, in large part, because of access to family planning. The hypocrisy of these cases is profound. I can tell you having sat in the Supreme Court recently, having three women on the court that understand the impact on women of these laws has been momentous and I do believe if we had a Supreme Court that more equally represented all of America we would be getting different kinds of decisions. But I\u2019m hopeful that we will win this one. We will continue to provide care no matter what, including women who are uninsured, immigrant women, women who do not have the benefit of a birth control benefit. But it is exciting to see that birth control is now considered part of preventive medicine. For the first time! For the first time.\n\nTomorrow, #SCOTUS will hear #ZubikvBurwell, a case more about controlling women's bodies than anything else. https://t.co/Ir8wnTPxgg \u2014 Cecile Richards (@CecileRichards) March 22, 2016\n\nThough the Obama administration has exempted some 100 million Americans from the HHS mandate \u2013 including companies such as Pepsi, Chevron, and Exxon, the entire city of New York, and the U.S. military \u2013 the same administration insists that those who are defending their faith must be coerced into complying with the mandate or pay millions of dollars in punitive fines.\n\nIn response to a question about how she continues to get out her message when states are passing legislation restricting Planned Parenthood\u2019s taxpayer funding, Richards said, \u201cThe media has been incredibly important in not only talking about what Planned Parenthood does, but actually putting a human face on what it means when you cut healthcare.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a reckoning day coming and I believe in this election the rhetoric around Planned Parenthood, around reproductive healthcare access, around LGBT people is not going to go in the favor of folks who have been leading that charge,\u201d she added. \u201cThe American people strongly support Planned Parenthood because they support the work that we do.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Planned Parenthood CEO: \u2018Hypocrisy\u2019 of Religious Groups Resisting HHS Contraceptive Mandate Is \u2018Profound\u2019", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Planned Parenthood CEO: \u2018Hypocrisy\u2019 of Religious Groups Resisting HHS Contraceptive Mandate Is \u2018Profound\u2019", "title": "Planned Parenthood CEO: \u2018Hypocrisy\u2019 of Religious Groups Resisting HHS Contraceptive Mandate Is \u2018Profound\u2019 - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/04/GettyImages-496526714.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/04/12/planned-parenthood-ceo-hypocrisy-of-religious-groups-fighting-hhs-contraceptive-mandate-is-profound/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Planned Parenthood CEO: \u2018Hypocrisy\u2019 of Religious Groups Resisting HHS Contraceptive Mandate Is \u2018Profound\u2019", "title": "Planned Parenthood CEO: \u2018Hypocrisy\u2019 of Religious Groups Resisting HHS Contraceptive Mandate Is \u2018Profound\u2019 - Breitbart", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/04/GettyImages-496526714.jpg", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "abortion-inducing drugs, Cecile Richards, free birth control, HHS mandate, liberal media, obamacare, Planned Parenthood, religious liberty exemptions,Abortion, Big Government, Faith,Richards", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Abortion", "tag": "religious liberty exemptions", "published_time": "2016-04-12T17:53:03-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,Faith,Abortion"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe American people strongly support Planned Parenthood because they support the work that we do.\u201d\nWe will continue to provide care no matter what, including women who are uninsured, immigrant women, women who do not have the benefit of a birth control benefit.\nBut it is exciting to see that birth control is now considered part of preventive medicine.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERRichards said:It\u2019s incredible to me that any employer in the 21st century would deny their employees access to birth control.\nUpwards of 95 percent of women use birth control at some point in their lifetime."}
