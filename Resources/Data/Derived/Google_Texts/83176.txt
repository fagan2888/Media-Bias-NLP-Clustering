A Canadian soldier who died in a hit-and-run Monday was apparently targeted in a terror attack, authorities said Tuesday.

Royal Canadian Mounted Police spokesman David Falls told reporters that the suspect, who was shot and killed by police following the incident, “was known to federal authorities” who “were concerned that he had become radicalized,” The Associated Press reported.

An official identified the suspect as 25-year-old Martin Couture Rouleau of Quebec, adding that the suspect had been influenced by radical Islam, AP reported. No further details were provided.

Police identified the victim as Warrant Officer Patrice Vincent, 53. A fellow soldier with him at the time was also injured, AP reported.

The incident on Monday took place roughly 26 miles outside Montreal.

“First and foremost our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families; we’re closely monitoring the situation and obviously we will make available all of the resources of the federal government,” Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper said, AP reported.

Officials are worried the attack could be a harbinger of future violence because the Islamic State group has urged Muslims in Western countries to target military personnel.
