The company sells its software to pharmacies in the U.S., Mexico and the Caribbean. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.\n\nFor its investment, Chicago-based GTCR partnered with the company\u0092s existing CEO, Steve Wubker, who will continue to head the business. The move is consistent with the firm's the Leaders Strategy, under which GTCR partners with management teams to build companies.

Macquarie Corporate and Asset Finance Lending, Golub Capital, Orix Leveraged Finance, Ares Capital Corp. and Business Development Corp. of America provided financing for the deal. Kirkland & Ellis LLP was GTCR's legal counsel, and William Blair & Co. was the firm's financial adviser.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act has opened the gate for more patients to enter the U.S. health care system, which can put additional pressure on providers. Technology is one way they can pare down costs, which is one of the reasons we've seen so many health care tech transactions.\n\nAside from GTCR's latest deal, other companies have also made moves in the space. Fujifilm Medical Systems USA Inc. bought clinical archiving technology company TeraMedica in May, and Digirad Corp.
