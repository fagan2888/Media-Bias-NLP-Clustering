President Obama has been an advocate of using behavioral psychology on citizens for the purposes of policymaking, despite criticisms from notable individuals such as Bill Shughart, professor of public choice at Utah State University, who argue that the behaviorists \u201care saying that you, consumer, are stupid.\u201d And despite the use of taxpayer dollars to fund this unconstitutional and downright frightening team, the findings were not exactly monumental.\n\nPolitico reports that the president officially adopted the notion of using behavioral psychology in policymaking when he launched the White House Social and Behavioral Science Team (SBST) last year. However, his affinity for the use of this science to influence the American people was clear long before that in his selection of Cass Sunstein as his regulatory czar. Sunstein authored a book on the subject, entitled, Nudge \u2014 Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness. Sunstein\u2019s book provides a variety of behavioral psychology measures that can be taken to \"nudge\u201d Americans toward healthier lifestyles while causing them to think that in fact they are making the decisions themselves.\n\nSunstein has indicated that the presence of too many choices can be confusing to people. In describing the premise of his book, he virtually claimed that the American people were too ignorant and undisciplined to make proper decisions. \u201cWe think there is a little Homer Simpson in all of us,\" he asserted. \"Sometimes we have self-control problems, sometimes we\u2019re impulsive. In these circumstances, both public and private institutions, without coercing, can make our lives a lot better.\u201d\n\nAccording to Sunstein, \u201cOnce we know that people are human and have some Homer Simpson in them, then there\u2019s a lot that can be done to manipulate them.\u201d It is that very some philosophy that was involved in the creation and selling of ObamaCare.\n\nThe SBST report\u2019s findings are not exactly groundbreaking. The study found, for example, that young people respond to text messages, which only a quick glance across a school campus would reveal. However, the Department of Education and the SBST partnered with a nonprofit organization to improve the low matriculation of low-income students who had been accepted to college but did not matriculate for their freshman year. The non-profit organization elected to send text messages to select students with reminders to complete certain necessary tasks before they arrived on campus, there was a nine-percent increase in the number of low-income students matriculated.\n\nThe report also states that adding a prompt on a federal form asking vendors to promise that they\u2019d submitted accurate information has resulted in more honest answers.\n\nPolitico writes,\n\nOn certain transactions, federal vendors are required to pay a fee on quarterly sales, which they self-report through an online form. To improve honest reporting, the General Services Administration \u2014 the agency that manages the function of different agencies \u2014 added a small prompt to the top of the form asking vendors to promise they were submitting accurate information. Lying on the prompt has no legal repercussions, but it still led to a $1.59 million increase in fees in one quarter, suggesting that the respondents were more fully reporting their sales.\n\nThe study also found that while most people respond to \u201cpeer pressure\u201d of sorts, doctors do not. In that study, people that saw sentences like \u201c9 out of 10 people pay their taxes on time\u201d were more likely to also pay their taxes on time. A similar experiment was attempted on doctors. A letter was sent to physicians who had prescribed more medications than their colleagues informing them that they were prescribing medications at abnormally high rates, but the letters had no impact on the prescription rates.\n\nThe report also found that the use of e-mails to ask Americans to complete a particular task, whether it was to pay their student loans or sign up for retirement, resulted in an increase in people completing those tasks. Similarly, the report found that letter communications were effective as well.\n\nDid the government really need to pay a team of people to discover these vast wonders?\n\nAccording to Politico\u2019s Danny Vinik, the projects found in the report do not quite entail \u201cnudging\u201d in the way behavioral psychologists would define it, as they did not involve changing the \u201cchoice architecture\u201d for those involved.\n\nFor some, that was disappointing. \u201cI\u2019d like to see more economic ideas get involved,\u201d said Richard Thaler, an economist at the University of Chicago who co-wrote Nudge with Sunstein, \u201cbut so far that hasn\u2019t happened.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, the SBST believes they\u2019ve made significant headway with their findings, as evidenced in the introductory letter to the report. \u201cA strong body of evidence demonstrates that research insights about behavior, when incorporated into the design of Federal programs and policies, have significantly improved Americans\u2019 lives, whether by boosting retirement savings nationwide or helping more low-income students get to college each year,\u201d according to John P. Holdren, assistant to the president for science and technology director, Office of Science and Technology Policy.\n\nBut despite what the report has revealed, the Obama administration has heavily relied on the use of behavioral science to bring about significant policy change.\n\nA prime example involves ObamaCare. Last year, it was revealed by ObamaCare architect Jonathan Gruber that the Obama administration deliberately relied on a lack of transparency in order to get the president's healthcare law passed, adding that the legislation was written in an intentionally vague manner because of \u201cthe stupidity of the American voter.\u201d\n\nFox News noted that Gruber is an MIT professor who played a role in the design for ObamaCare. He appeared at a panel hosted by the Penn Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics on October 17, 2013, which was captured on video but did not gain media attention until 2014, wherein he admitted that though the individual mandate was upheld by the Supreme Court because it was perceived as a tax, it is in fact not a tax.\n\nGruber explained, \u201cThis bill was written in a tortured way to make sure CBO [the Congressional Budget Office] did not score the mandate as taxes. If CBO scored the mandate as taxes, the bill dies.\u201d\n\nGruber\u2019s sentiments mirrored those that Bill Shughart warned was generally true of behaviorists, that the consumer is in fact stupid. \"Lack of transparency is a huge political advantage. And basically, call it the stupidity of the American voter or whatever, but basically that was really, really critical for the thing to pass.\"\n\nGruber outlined exactly what was needed to be done in order for the bill to pass:\n\nIn terms of risk rated subsidies, if you had a law which said that healthy people are going to pay in \u2014 you made explicit healthy people pay in and sick people get money, it would not have passed.\n\nGruber added that he wished the law could have been transparent, but that he\u2019d \u201crather have this law than not.\u201d\n\nAh, the plight of the elite behaviorist!\n\nAnd once again, the taxpayers are footing the bill for another unconstitutional government entity, this time, one that hopes to achieve a \u201cmind-control\u201d initiative.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "immigration, crime, politics, healthcare, judicial decisions, foreign policy, America, us, united states", "og": {"url": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/item/21769-scientific-findings-of-obama-s-mind-control-social-and-behavioral-science-team", "image": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/media/k2/items/cache/78037ae2b339adfe8b8ce3dc3fd019e8_XL.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Topics such as immigration, crime, politics, healthcare, judicial decisions, and foreign policy across America, with nuggets of analysis that can\u2019t be found anywhere else, focusing on rights, prosperity, and liberty.", "title": "\"Scientific\" Findings of Obama's Mind-control Social and Behavioral Science Team"}, "image": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/media/k2/items/cache/78037ae2b339adfe8b8ce3dc3fd019e8_XL.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Last month, the White House\u2019s Social and Behavioral Science Team published its first annual report on the effectiveness of behavioral science to achieve policy change.\nPolitico reports that the president officially adopted the notion of using behavioral psychology in policymaking when he launched the White House Social and Behavioral Science Team (SBST) last year.\nBut despite what the report has revealed, the Obama administration has heavily relied on the use of behavioral science to bring about significant policy change.\nDid the government really need to pay a team of people to discover these vast wonders?\nIn that study, people that saw sentences like \u201c9 out of 10 people pay their taxes on time\u201d were more likely to also pay their taxes on time."}
