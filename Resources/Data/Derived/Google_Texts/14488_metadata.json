Temperatures will remain below freezing all day today, so be prepared to keep dealing with a number of weather-related issues. Roads are still dangerous, tens of thousands are still without power and flights are still being cancelled. Here\u2019s a look at the latest on a number of fronts that we\u2019ll keep updating throughout Saturday.\n\nROADS:\n\nUpdated at 9:50 p.m.: Contrary to initial reports, Fort Worth police will not be shutting down all freeways to clear ice.\n\nTxDOT\u2019s Fort Worth bureau said they would coordinate with Fort Worth police Sunday morning to clear out corridors of ice, just like they did during the 2011 Super Bowl.\n\n\u201cWe would need their coordination to help direct traffic out of the way,\u201d public information officer Val Lopez said.\n\nLopez said conditions would have to be right, but instead of closing all freeways and overpasses they would work one roadway at a time.\n\nFort Worth police said the state of Texas will deploy a task force of heavy duty road maintainers, sand and salt trucks, and other resources to clear the cobblestone ice. There will be temporary highway closures at specific locations in Tarrant County affected by the cobblestone ice. Once it the ice has been removed, the highways will be reopened.\n\nThe Texas Department of Public Safety is also working to stop all 18-wheeler traffic through 6 a.m. on Monday. If the trucks are moving, they will be allowed to continue, police said. If they are stopped on the roadway or shoulder, they will have to move to a safe area to park until the roads are safer.\n\nPolice emphasized that all drivers should stay off the road. Those words of caution have been echoed by law enforcement and emergency teams across North Texas:\n\nMotorists who choose to travel US75 NB and SB through Grayson County are risking their lives. #txwx #stayinOK #staysouth \u2014 Grayson County OEM (@GraysonCounty) December 8, 2013\n\nThe westbound I-30 exit at Summit is closed because of stranded 18-wheelers. Traffic is moving slowly on I-20 eastbound because of two jackknifed 18-wheelers. Interstate 35W north of U.S. 287 is also experiencing issues with ice.\n\nUpdated at 7:42 p.m.: In Fort Worth, eastbound I-20 between Weatherford and Loop 820 will be closed because of icy conditions. Forth Worth police are also advising drivers to avoid Highway 81 at Ramhorn Hill Road near the Tarrant/Wise County line for the next two hours. There is a truck accident affecting both lanes.\n\nUpdated 5:28 p.m.: Carrollton police are urging drivers to stay off I-35 southbound if possible, due to poor conditions. Police are working on a crash involving three or four vehicles near Frankford Road. In Irving only the left lane of eastbound Highway 114 at Spur 482 is open. Westbound traffic is using the right shoulder.\n\nI-35 has proved to be dangerous for drivers Saturday. Earlier today, Interstate 35-E in Carrollton was shut down in both directions due to a wreck. Around the same time, the westbound lanes of Interstate 30 were shut down in two places in Dallas County, because an 18-wheeler jack-knifed on the road in each instance.\n\nAt least one person has died in an accident, likely due to weather. And Sanger remains a traffic nightmare on northbound Interstate 35. With temperatures not reaching past the mid-20s today, treacherous streets and dangerous highway overpasses are still an issue throughout North Texas today.\n\nThe body of one person was found in a silver pickup truck that went over a Lewisville Lake bridge. WFAA reports that witnesses saw the truck slide over the guardrail at 3:30 a.m. Saturday morning. Rescue teams worked for hours to locate and pull the truck out of the icy lake.\n\nMuch of the slush from the winter storm has refrozen on areas roads, making streets and highways that weren\u2019t already iced over slick.\n\n\u201cDuring this time and with any major weather event, I\u2019d advise that if you don\u2019t have to go out don\u2019t travel,\u201d said meteorologist Joe Harris.\n\n\u2013 Christina Rosales, Julie Fancher, Claire Cardona /Staff Writers\n\nFLIGHTS:\n\nUpdated 7:46 p.m.: About half of scheduled flights are getting out of Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport right now. Sunday cancellations are already starting, but airport spokesman David Magana doesn\u2019t have an estimate of how many flights are affected.\n\nTwo runways are open. The airport has seven total, but normally only operates with five. Magana said crews are working to get a third online, but the amount of accumulated ice combined with below-freezing temperatures is making it difficult.\n\n\u201cAs you know we\u2019ve got a lot of ice on the ground,\u201d Magana said.\n\nIn all, more than 400 flights have been cancelled today. Magana expects more passengers to stay overnight tonight, but doesn\u2019t know how many will. About 4,000 slept there Friday night.\n\nExpect delays calling airlines and at ticket counters at the airport. There are reports of about 300 people in line at the American Airlines counter in Terminal D.\n\nEven if you\u2019re flight is still a go, the roads to the airport will likely prove dangerous. Roads around the airport are icy, but open.\n\nThe airport suggests side roads like Mid Cities Boulevard and Walnut Hill to get into the airport.\n\n\u2013Brandon Formby/Staff Writer\n\nWEATHER FORECAST:\n\nUpdated at 7:18 p.m.: Freezing fog is moving through the area. It\u2019s affecting Dallas, Waco and points south and east of there.\n\nSome light mist will accompany the fog, which will deposit a fine glaze of ice on the ground, said Ted Ryan, meteorologist with the National Weather Service Fort Worth.\n\nSince there is already ice on the streets, the freezing fog won\u2019t make too much of a difference on the roadways, Ryan said. It should disappear when the sun comes out, but drivers should remain cautious.\n\nUpdated 3:35 p.m.: The National Weather Service says some light sleet and snow are falling in different parts of Dallas-Fort Worth today, but none of it will be enough to accumulate. Temperatures are expected to hover around 25 degrees for the rest of the day and into the night. Tomorrow, North Texas will finally see the thermometer rise above 32 degrees, but not for long.\n\nThe high for tomorrow will be in the mid-30s. It will be sunny, so some of the ice left from this week\u2019s winter storm will start to melt. But by sunset temperatures will fall back into the mis20s, so whatever melts will likely just refreeze.\n\n\u201cTomorrow night is still going to be an issue,\u201d said Jennifer Dunn, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service.\n\n\u2013Brandon Formby, Claire Cardona /Staff Writers\n\nPOWER OUTAGES:\n\nUpdated 5:45 p.m.: Oncor spokeswoman Jamey Molina said about 75,000 remained without power Saturday evening, slightly less than earlier in the day. That was down from a peak of 270,000 on Friday.\n\nMolina said they hope to restore power to at least 5,000 more people by midnight Saturday.\n\nThe company has more than doubled its workforce by bringing in workers from Arkansas, Mississippi, Florida and South Texas. About 3,700 people were repairing lines in the area.\n\nAnna Kurian, another spokeswoman, said Oncor now expects to have power restored to almost everyone by Sunday night. The only exceptions, she said, will be rural areas and homes that have had specific damage to their electrical system.\n\nThe company\u2019s Twitter feed has been flooded with inquiries from frustrated people, but it has been unable to provide guesses for when specific areas will be back online.\n\nKurian said she understands people\u2019s frustration.\n\n\u201cA moment without power feels like an eternity, especially in this cold weather\u201d she said. \u201cWe are doing everything we can to restore power as quickly as possible.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Matthew Watkins/Staff Writer", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDEzLzEyL21lc3N5LXJvYWQtY29uZGl0aW9ucy1leHBlY3RlZC10by1saW5nZXItdGhyb3VnaC10aGUtd2Vla2VuZC10aG91c2FuZHMtc3RpbGwtd2l0aG91dC1wb3dlci5odG1sLw==", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Julie Fancher", "og": {"site_name": "The Scoop Blog", "description": "North Texas is still struggling to recover from this week's winter storm.
