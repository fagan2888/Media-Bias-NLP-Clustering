The pontiff declined, instead sending a cardinal from the impoverished West African nation of Ghana to the gathering with a message.\n\nRelated: Pope Francis Slams Capitalism and Growing Inequality\n\nThe papal missive began by recognizing the role that the business sector has had in economic development and innovation, and that it has helped reduce poverty for a great number of people. However, he added, business successes \u201coften have led to a widespread social exclusion.\u201d\n\nIt should not have been hard for any of the attendees at the ultra-exclusive event in a posh Swiss resort town to miss the point.\n\nJust in case anyone did, though, the message continued. Francis urged attendees to work for policies that support the \u201cdignity of every human person and the common good,\u201d issues that currently seem to be \u201clittle more than an afterthought.\u201d\n\nHe reminded them of their \u201cprecise responsibility towards others, particularly those who are most frail, weak and vulnerable.\u201d He added, \u201cIt is intolerable that thousands of people continue to die every day from hunger, even though substantial quantities of food are available, and often simply wasted.\u201d\n\nRelated: Pope My Ride: The Coolest Popemobiles Ever\n\nHunger, of course, will not be a problem in Davos this week. The Wall Street Journal reported that just one hotel laid in an extra 4,700 bottles of wine and Champagne and 176 pounds of salmon to meet the demand generated by conference-goers.\n\n\u201cI know that these words are forceful, even dramatic,\u201d the pope continued, \u201cbut they seek both to affirm and to challenge the ability of this assembly to make a difference. In fact, those who have demonstrated their aptitude for being innovative and for improving the lives of many people by their ingenuity and professional expertise can further contribute by putting their skills at the service of those who are still living in dire poverty.\u201d\n\nFrancis ended his message by invoking \u201cdivine blessings on you and the participants of the Forum, as well as on your families and all your work.\u201d\n\nRelated: Why Our Economy Is Still in \u201cDeep Disrepair\u201d\n\nPerhaps ironically, inequality actually is on the agenda at the WEF conference this year. A report issued on December 30 by the group warned, among other things, of \u201cgrowing economic inequality and weakening social cohesion within countries, which threaten political stability.\u201d\n\nA small number of sessions at the conference addressed the kind of topic that Francis raised in his letter, but the title of one of them inspired little confidence. The \u201copen forum\u201d scheduled for Thursday bore the title, \u201cEthical Capitalism \u2013 Worth a Try?\u201d\n\nFollow Rob Garver on Twitter @rrgarver\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "As the wealthy and influential gathered for the World Economic Forum in Davos this week, the leader of the Roman Catholic Church reminded them that with privilege comes responsibility.", "title": "Pope Tells Davos\u2019 High Rollers to Help Those in Need", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/01/22/Pope-Tells-Davos-High-Rollers-Help-those-Need", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/01222014_Pope_Francis.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/01/22/Pope-Tells-Davos-High-Rollers-Help-those-Need", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/01222014_Pope_Francis.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "As the wealthy and influential gathered for the World Economic Forum in Davos this week, the leader of the Roman Catholic Church reminded them that with privilege comes responsibility.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3976\"", "article_summary": "The pontiff declined, instead sending a cardinal from the impoverished West African nation of Ghana to the gathering with a message.\nPope Francis was invited to attend the World Economic Forum\u2019s annual meeting in Davos this week \u2013 an event that attracts the wealthy and influential and where, according to The New York Times, $70,000 will barely get you in the door.\nThe \u201copen forum\u201d scheduled for Thursday bore the title, \u201cEthical Capitalism \u2013 Worth a Try?\u201dFollow Rob Garver on Twitter @rrgarverTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:\nRelated: Pope Francis Slams Capitalism and Growing InequalityThe papal missive began by recognizing the role that the business sector has had in economic development and innovation, and that it has helped reduce poverty for a great number of people.\n\u201cI know that these words are forceful, even dramatic,\u201d the pope continued, \u201cbut they seek both to affirm and to challenge the ability of this assembly to make a difference."}
