(WALL STREET JOURNAL) – Ted Cruz has health insurance, and he had it all along, his campaign said Friday night, reversing what the presidential candidate said a day earlier.

Mr. Cruz told a Manchester, N.H., audience on Thursday that he was currently uninsured – which he said infuriated his wife – after Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas canceled many individual policies, including his. As a result, Mr. Cruz said he was now looking to buy a new plan at sharply higher premiums, a turn of events he attributed to the Affordable Care Act, also called Obamacare. Mr. Cruz has been a harsh critic of the health law.

But it turns out he was never uninsured. So why did he think he had lost coverage and didn’t have any currently?
