But if you\u2019re a YouTuber in any way, shape, or form, you\u2019re probably familiar with her award-winning series My Drunk Kitchen, which features videos of Hart cooking up meals while \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 pounding drinks.\n\n\n\nBut while other YouTube stars hone in on their specialty (creating makeup lines to accompany makeup channels, for example), Hart\u2019s been on a mission of sorts. She\u2019s chatted with President Obama and filmed a controversial video on the Affordable Care Act. She\u2019s started filming videos that veer away from food, covering everything from insecurities to going to the gym. Mental health and body positivity isn\u2019t her main shtick, but that\u2019s what makes her videos on the topics all the more powerful for her 2.4 million followers.\n\n\n\nYahoo Health got the chance to talk with Hart about feeling at peace in her body, and more. Check out the conversation below:\n\n\n\nYahoo Health: Have you ever struggled with body confidence?\n\nHannah Hart: When I was younger, I was really insecure about body hair. I\u2019ve got fair skin, and people would be like, \u201cOh, you should go wax,\u201d and give me all this advice. But not all the advice really works for everybody. So one [struggle I had] was feeling comfortable taking care of body hair in a way that works for me, getting rid of the stigma of wanting to talk about it.\n\nAnd the other instance [I struggled with body confidence] was, as a lesbian, having sex with other women, being like, \u201cWow, you\u2019re so hot!\u201d I\u2019m definitely somebody who feels confident with verbal affirmations with my partner, and that\u2019s something that I had to learn about myself. As much as I\u2019d love to say, like, \u201cJust say more positive things to yourself!,\u201d it\u2019s also OK to say, \u201cI have a need!\u201d Because I need my partner to verbally reassure me sometimes, and that\u2019s OK. It\u2019s OK to have that need, and it\u2019s OK to vocalize it. I think we convince ourselves that we need to be totally singular without the support of anyone else, but sometimes it\u2019s OK to say, \u201cBabe, tell me I look good.\u201d I think I can say that with confidence because I\u2019m working on loving myself and being confident, and obviously those are massive pieces of the equation, but it\u2019s also OK to know that you need your partner to say things or do things.\n\n(Photo: Instagram)\n\nI\u2019m not saying to only seek outside support \u2014 rather, surround yourself with people who are kind. I\u2019m not fishing for compliments. If I think I look amazing, I\u2019m going to be like, \u201cI look great!\u201d Just don\u2019t ignore the fact that the way people talk to us has an effect on the way we feel.\n\nWhat about with YouTube or social media comments \u2014 do those affect you?\n\nYou can only take the good, you can\u2019t take the bad. With the comment section, you get an outpouring of positivity and positive comments, and it\u2019s really lovely in that it\u2019s so motivating. But that one negative comment usually has nothing to do with your channel, it\u2019s just someone spouting negativity. But sometimes, if they\u2019re like, \u201cI don\u2019t know, I feel like Hannah really rushed that one,\u201d and they\u2019re right, I\u2019ll be like, \u201cYou\u2019re right, I did rush that one.\u201d But 9 times out of 10, if someone is spouting negativity, it\u2019s them projecting, trying to find power in the wrong place. You just have to brush that dirt off your shoulder.\n\nYou\u2019ve talked about how you recently started going to the gym \u2014 why?\n\nRead More", "article_metadata": {"description": "This interview is part of Yahoo Health\u2019s Body-Peace Profiles series, in which we talk with our favorite celebrities about embracing body positivity and healthy habits.", "og": {"url": "https://www.yahoo.com/beauty/youtube-star-hannah-harts-2-biggest-insecurities-160459686.html", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/QDOg58FboLEqZsHZyD3uyQ--/aD04NTM7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://s.yimg.com/cd/resizer/2.0/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w1280/6d8443533f30b452ca84bfc0aea742f4a0cd108d.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "This interview is part of Yahoo Health\u2019s Body-Peace Profiles series, in which we talk with our favorite celebrities about embracing body positivity and healthy habits.", "title": "YouTube Star Hannah Hart's 2 Biggest Insecurities \u2014 and How She Overcame Them"}, "twitter": {"description": "This interview is part of Yahoo Health\u2019s Body-Peace Profiles series, in which we talk with our favorite celebrities about embracing body positivity and healthy habits.", "title": "YouTube Star Hannah Hart's 2 Biggest Insecurities \u2014 and How She Overcame Them", "image": {"src": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/QDOg58FboLEqZsHZyD3uyQ--/aD04NTM7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://s.yimg.com/cd/resizer/2.0/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w1280/6d8443533f30b452ca84bfc0aea742f4a0cd108d.jpg", "identifier": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/QDOg58FboLEqZsHZyD3uyQ--/aD04NTM7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://s.yimg.com/cd/resizer/2.0/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w1280/6d8443533f30b452ca84bfc0aea742f4a0cd108d.jpg"}, "creator": "@mollylizshea", "site": "@YahooBeauty", "dnt": "on", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#6e329d", "Yahoo": "app-id=304158842,app-argument=https://www.yahoo.com/beauty/youtube-star-hannah-harts-2-biggest-insecurities-160459686.html", "al": {"android": {"url": "yahoo://article/view?uuid=5d642b02-3056-316f-88f2-88b94cb63835&src=web", "package": "com.yahoo.mobile.client.android.yahoo"}, "ios": {"url": "https://www.yahoo.com/beauty/youtube-star-hannah-harts-2-biggest-insecurities-160459686.html", "app_name": "Yahoo", "app_store_id": 304158842}}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s.yimg.com/os/mit/media/p/presentation/images/icons/win8-tile-1484740.png", "theme-color": "#400090"}, "article_summary": "But while other YouTube stars hone in on their specialty (creating makeup lines to accompany makeup channels, for example), Hart\u2019s been on a mission of sorts.\nYahoo Health got the chance to talk with Hart about feeling at peace in her body, and more.\nShe\u2019s started filming videos that veer away from food, covering everything from insecurities to going to the gym.\nHannah Hart: When I was younger, I was really insecure about body hair.\nMaybe you\u2019ve only seen 29-year-old Hannah Hart in ads for YouTube, posted online, in New York subways, and on billboards countrywide, her head adorned with a pasta colander."}
