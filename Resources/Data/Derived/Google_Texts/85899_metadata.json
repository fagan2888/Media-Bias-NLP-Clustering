Tom Coburn\u2019s latest \u201cWastebook\u201d report, which highlights the most egregious waste of taxpayer dollars each year. NASA made several appearances in this year\u2019s report for handing out hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of research grants to study things like Congress, red crabs and how to make a 3D pizza printer.\n\nRelated: Government Blatantly Wastes $30 Billion This Year\n\n\u201cOur nation\u2019s space agency can fly people to the moon or even the International Space Station, but it is still studying little red creatures. Not Martians, but Christmas Island crabs,\u201d Coburn said in the report.\n\nThough Coburn\u2019s office deemed these projects wasteful, scientists disagree.\n\nStephanie Pappas, a senior writer at LiveScience says Coburn\u2019s criticism falls short and fails to realize the importance of NASA\u2019s research. \u201cUnfortunately, Coburn and his staff frequently oversimplify the research in their zeal to criticize spending.\u201d Pappas adds that the senator\u2019s office never even contacted any of the researchers whose projects were featured in the \u201cWastebook\u201d to get more information on their work.\n\nStill, Coburn continues to defend the \u201cWastebook\u201d saying that he isn\u2019t questioning the \"validity or value of the science,\" simply whether it should be footed by the taxpayer.\n\n\"If a study that received funds would be seen by the average person as questionable or lower-priority it is considered for inclusion in Wastebook,\" Coburn spokesman John Hart told LiveScience. \"If you don\u2019t want your research to be questioned, don\u2019t ask for federal funds.\"\n\nRelated: Defense Department Spends Billions on Weird Research\n\nNASA\u2019s annual $17 billion budget is bracing for more cuts next year, with more than $200 million to be slashed from the agency\u2019s Planetary Science Division.\n\nHere are some NASA projects highlighted on Coburn\u2019s list. Wasteful or useful? You be the judge:\n\n$3 million to study Congress. Teaming up with Georgetown University, NASA will host its annual \u201cCongressional Operations Seminar\u201d on Capitol Hill. The week-long seminar will explore how \u201cCongress is organized, the key players and their roles, how the legislative process really works, and how Congress directly affects the daily operations of every department and agency in the Executive Branch.\u201d Though it sounds educational, we\u2019re not sure why rocket scientists need an expensive civics seminar to further its mission.\n\n$400,000 to create \u201cthe Little Green Ninja.\u201d NASA teamed up with the National Science Foundation to develop a cartoon ninja that will inspire children to become interested in climate change. One of its creators said the goal is \u201cto make the Green Ninja the next Smokey Bear.\u201d\n\n$360,000 for \u201cPillownauts\u201d During the shutdown, 97 percent of NASA\u2019s staff was laid off, still the agency was paying 20 people $18,000 each to literally lie around and do nothing for 70 days with their body \u201cslightly tilted forward\u201d for a study to help scientists learn how astronauts bodies will change in space flight. However, NASA isn\u2019t planning any missions anytime in the foreseeable future, since it no longer has a manned space program.\n\n$240,000 to study red crabs NASA awarded researchers a grant to study what triggered red crabs\u2019 migration from their \u201cinland burrows\u201d to the ocean to deliver their eggs. The research concluded that the crabs begin their migration when rainfall reaches 22 millimeters in a certain timeframe. Though interesting, Coburn\u2019s office suggests that it may be more relevant to other agencies, like the National Science Foundation. However, researchers at Princeton say, \u201cThe crabs are a test case for how global warming will alter the migration of tropical species, \u201caccording to a news release on the study.\n\n$125,000 for a 3D Pizza Printer: NASA awarded a $124,955 grant to Arjun Contractor to build a 3-D pizza printer, which sounds amazing, but also unnecessary amid dwindling resources. According to the report, the space agency spends about $1 million on \u201cMartian food development,\u201d though a Mars mission is far, far off in the distance. As is the pizza printer, according to a NASA scientist who told Coburn\u2019s office it could be years until the creation becomes feasible. Too bad, it sounds out of this world.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "NASA has suffered from major budget cuts that have severely scaled back its mission an", "title": "NASA Makes Coburn\u2019s List for Wasteful Spending", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/12/26/NASA-Makes-Coburn-s-List-Wasteful-Spending", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/slideshows/08272012_Armstrong_Apollo11_slideshow.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/12/26/NASA-Makes-Coburn-s-List-Wasteful-Spending", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/slideshows/08272012_Armstrong_Apollo11_slideshow.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "NASA has suffered from major budget cuts that have severely scaled back its mission an", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe288c\"", "article_summary": "$240,000 to study red crabs NASA awarded researchers a grant to study what triggered red crabs\u2019 migration from their \u201cinland burrows\u201d to the ocean to deliver their eggs.\nThat\u2019s according to Sen.
