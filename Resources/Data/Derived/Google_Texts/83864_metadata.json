Insiders say Michelle suspects Barack of having an affair with every woman who\u2019s alone with him.\n\n2 The First Lady freaked when she learned that Obama was caught by staff with a woman during a solo trip overseas. The incident was \u201chushed up,\u201d according to an insider.\n\n3 Michelle went ballistic after Japanese politician, Kazuyuki Hamada, claimed Obama cheated on her during a spring visit to Tokyo. Things got worse when she saw photos of Barack and U.S. Ambassador to Japan, Caroline Kennedy, getting close.\n\n4 The President was seen at the internationally televised memorial service for Nelson Mandela laughing, snapping a selfie and caressing the shoulder of Denmark\u2019s attractive Prime Minister, Helle Thorning-Schmidt, while Michelle fumed beside him.\n\n5 A source tells The National ENQUIRER that when Michelle learned the Secret Service had covered up the President\u2019s infidelities after the Mandela funeral, she demanded they pass the info on to her.\n\n6 The First Family took a trip to Hawaii earlier this year with the couple intending to work on their relationship, but the President returned to Washington with their daughters, encouraging Michelle to stay behind and \u201cenjoy herself.\u201d\n\n7 In 2013, after the President infamously said of California Attorney General Kamala Harris, \u201cShe happens to be \u2013 by far \u2013 the best-looking attorney general in the country,\u201d Michelle booted him out of their bedroom, screaming: \u201cYou can sleep on the couch \u2013 or in the doghouse.\u201d\n\n8 The President often golfs with high school buddy Bobby Titcomb, who was arrested three years ago in a Honolulu prostitution bust. \u201cMichelle was not only outraged, she also wondered why the President would hang out with someone who solicits prostitutes,\u201d an insider said.\n\n9 The First Lady reportedly has a secret file of incriminating new charges that indicate the President cheated on her. The file was compiled by a team of private investigators.\n\n10 The investigators were hired by members of her inner circle in Chicago and Washington. \u201cBarack won\u2019t have a prayer if he tries to defend himself. The secret file details his every flirt, fling and grope,\u201d revealed a source.\n\n11 Divorce is a certainty. \u201cFor the sake of her husband\u2019s presidency, she\u2019s going to have to stand by her man until his second term ends in 2017,\u201d one tipster said.\n\n12 Michelle has told Obama that she wants a life apart from him. \u201cShe is moving into one of the vacant bedrooms in the family\u2019s private living quarters and is moving his personal things out,\u201d the insider added.\n\nMONEY WOES\n\n13 The private school in Washington D.C., attended by daughters Sasha, 13, and Malia, 16, costs an astonishing $70,000 per year.\n\n14 Obama exploded when Michelle refused to cancel a $4 million educational tour with Sasha, Malia and her mother, Marian Robinson, despite the urging of White House advisers who told him that the couple\u2019s six-year vacation tab had already drained the U.S. Treasury of a whopping $150 million in taxpayer money.\n\n15 Michelle arrived in China wearing a $3,000 suede dress by designer Derek Lam as she exited Air Force One. This came after Obama had advised the American public to examine frivolous monthly expenses like cell phone bills before declaring Obamacare too expensive.\n\n16 With her mother and daughters in tow, Michelle checked into the lavish presidential suite at the Beijing Westin hotel, to the tune of $8,350 per night. The 3,400-square-foot suite included 24-hour butler service and a steam room.\n\n17 While campaigning for his second term, Obama flew on Air Force One to Chicago to attend two Democratic fundraisers at a cost of $180,000 per hour.\n\n18 That same day, Michelle headed to a hoity-toity Boston hotel to have lunch with rich donors who\u2019d shelled out up to $37,600 per ticket for the privilege.\n\n19 Sasha and Malia\u2019s spring break trip to the Atlantis Resort on Paradise Island in the Bahamas cost an estimated $115,000.\n\n20 Other pricey family getaways have included Michelle\u2019s recent $467,000 tour of Spain and a $424,142 trip to Africa.\n\n21 In 2012 Michelle said, \u201cWe are entertaining like crazy. We got folks coming in and out of the house. We got a lot of people coming over. It\u2019s a good time. Everybody is feeling real positive.\u201d Except, perhaps, Americans who can\u2019t find work.\n\nDRUGS AND BOOZE\n\n22 The ENQUIRER has learned that 71 percent of students at Sasha and Malia\u2019s Sidwell Friends School in D.C. have said they attended parties where drugs were available.\n\n23 The Sidwell school faced a $10 million sex scandal lawsuit involving an alleged affair between a fired staff psychologist and the married mother of a student. The suit was dismissed.\n\n24 The drug issue also hits closer to home. \u201cThe President loves alcohol,\u201d a source said. \u201cHe drinks beer, wine, martinis, sparkling wine and margaritas. In fact, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s met a drink he doesn\u2019t like!\u201d\n\n25 The President quit smoking cigarettes six years ago, but has admitted: \u201cI smoked pot as a kid, and I view it as a bad habit and a vice, not very different from the cigarettes that I smoked as a young person.\u201d\n\nBAD OBAMA KARMA\n\n26 After Obama announced a platform calling for equal pay for women, it was revealed that the White House pays female employees less than their male counterparts.\n\n27 Former White House assistant press secretary Reid Cherlin says that Mrs. Obama\u2019s \u201chighly accomplished staffers (think) that the First Lady\u2019s office can be a confining, frustrating, even miserable place to work.\u201d\n\n28 Insiders say the First Lady regards her husband\u2019s presidency as a personal opportunity, telling friends, \u201cIf I have to go (to public functions as the First Lady), I\u2019m getting a new dress out of it.\u201d\n\n29 Obama\u2019s half-brother Mark Obama Ndesandjo has angered the President with plans to publish an autobiography that details the domestic abuse of their late father.\n\n30 Obama quieted crowds with the story of his mother fighting her health insurance company over coverage for her cancer treatments. But she was apparently reimbursed for most of her medical expenses without argument.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://www.nationalenquirer.com/wp-content/themes/vip/am-neq/images/favicon/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileColor": "#da532c", "description": "The secrets, the lies and the betrayal of a nation -The 30 facts the Obamas don\u2019t want you to know!", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "National Enquirer", "description": "The secrets, the lies and the betrayal of a nation -The 30 facts the Obamas don\u2019t want you to know!SEXUAL TENSION1 President Barack Obama has a wandering eye and the First Lady knows it.
