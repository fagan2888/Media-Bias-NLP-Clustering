Hospital stocks generally enjoyed bigger jumps after the ruling because the law has enabled many newly-insured patients to pay for care they were previously unable to afford.

However, share prices of U.S. health insurers benefited separately from anticipated mergers, including Anthem’s so-far rebuffed $47 billion bid for Cigna. Humana shares rose sharply Thursday after Bloomberg News reported that a potential acquisition by rival Aetna could be finalized as soon as this weekend.

Hospital Corporation of America spokesman Ed Fishbough said the nation’s leading provider of healthcare service was “very pleased with the court’s ruling.”

“As we have said before, we support efforts that improve access by providing affordable coverage for the uninsured,” he added.
