The premier examples were royal instructions to colonial governors, but the Continental and Confederation Congresses used the same language in instructing civil and military officials.\n\n\n\nThe Constitution\u2019s language is both a grant of enumerated power to the President and a mandatory duty imposed on him.\n\nThe Obama administration\u2019s partial refusal to enforce various laws has raised questions of whether the President is violating the Constitution\u2019s command, and thus committing an impeachable offense.\n\nThe question can be a difficult one, because everyone recognizes that the President has some discretion in exercise of the executive power. For example, the cost of full enforcement might be far greater than the appropriated funds for enforcement, requiring the President to set priorties. Also, fully enforcing the law against some persons technically in violation can work great injustice.\n\nSo is Obama violating his constitutional duty or not? Legal scholar Zachary Price examines this question in a thoughtful, balanced article written for Vanderbilt Law Review.\n\nHe concludes that in its partial non-enforcement of marijuana laws, Obama is within the scope of his discretion, although somewhat close to the line. Obama crossed the line, however, in refusing to enforce mandates imposed by the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) and in granting exemptions from the immigration laws to whole classes of people.\n\nProfessor Price finds that the George W. Bush administration also exceeded the scope of its discretion in underenforcing \u201cNew Source Review\u201d environmental laws.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Constitution requires the President to \u201ctake Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.\u201d This \u201ctake Care\u201d language came from 18th century commissions and", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "og": {"site_name": "Tenth Amendment Center Blog", "description": "The Constitution requires the President to \u201ctake Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.\u201d This \u201ctake Care\u201d language came from 18th century commissions and formal instructions by which higher officials delineated what lower officials were to do.
