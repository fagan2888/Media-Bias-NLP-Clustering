But White House spokesman Reid Cherlin allayed those fears by confirming that Benjamin \u201csupports the president\u2019s position on reproductive health issues,\u201d according to LifeNews.com.\n\nPlanned Parenthood also listed Benjamin as a \u201cChampion of Reproductive Rights\u201d on its website.\n\nBenjamin reportedly served on the board of Physicians for Human Rights, an organization which not only called on President Bush not to expand the Mexico City Policy, which prevents taxpayer money from going to groups that promote and perform abortions around the world, but lauded President Obama\u2019s overturning of the policy.\n\nDr. Benjamin also reportedly served as a member of the Board of Trustees of the Catholic Health Association of the United States, which endorsed the HHS contraceptive and sterilization mandate in Obamacare.\n\nDr. Benjamin is an alumnus of the historically black Catholic college.\n\nThe relationship between the Obama administration and the Catholic college extends beyond this one appointment. In 2006, the University bestowed an Honorary Degree on then-Senator Obama. In 2010, President Obama delivered a speech from the campus.\n\nAnd a recent press release on the university\u2019s website states that two members of Xavier University of Louisiana\u2019s Board of Trustees \u2013 Dwight Bush, Sr., and Carla Harris \u2013 have been nominated by Obama for positions in his administration.\n\nBush has been nominated as the U.S. Ambassador to the Kingdom of Morocco, and Harris has been appointed chairperson of the National Women\u2019s Business Council.\n\nCatholic Education Daily is an online publication of The Cardinal Newman Society.
