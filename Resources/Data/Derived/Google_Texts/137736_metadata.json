Within a month it sailed through the House by voice vote.\n\nThere was nothing unusual about swift passage for the Welfare Reform Technical Corrections Act of 1997. But in retrospect, it underscores the deteriorating conditions in Washington today, as the Supreme Court has accepted a case threatening the Affordable Care Act over the interpretation of a single ambiguous phrase.\n\nThe 1997 act passed a year after President Bill Clinton and a Republican-led Congress had struck a broader deal on welfare, a racially charged issue that had roiled politics for two decades. The passage of the 1996 law followed fierce fighting \u2014 Mr. Clinton vetoed two welfare bills before signing the third \u2014 as well as a bitter budget fight that had temporarily shut down the government the previous winter.\n\nBy 1997, however, the political guns had fallen silent. Though Democratic leaders of both the House and Senate had opposed the 1996 law, the fight was over. The top House Republican on the issue, Representative E. Clay Shaw Jr. of Florida, quietly consulted Mr. Clinton\u2019s aides about ways the new welfare law needed clarification and adjustment to be implemented more effectively.\n\n\u201cWe worked with the administration even though we shut down the government \u2014 twice,\u201d recalled Ron Haskins, then Mr. Shaw\u2019s top welfare adviser. In August, the numerous \u201ctechnical corrections\u201d to the 1996 bill were folded into a budget deal and passed into law.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nToday the Affordable Care Act faces grave danger before the United States Supreme Court because such legislative repair work, once routine, has grown impossible.\n\nThe challenge in King v. Burwell, the case that the court recently accepted, rests on a part of the law creating taxpayer subsidies for the purchase of health insurance through marketplaces \u201cestablished by the state.\u201d That phrase, the plaintiffs argue, prohibits subsidies for purchasers using marketplaces established by the federal government for the 37 states that do not have their own.\n\nThe Obama administration and the law\u2019s sponsors in Congress counter that they never intended such a prohibition. None was discussed in debates leading to the law\u2019s passage. The Congressional Budget Office, which estimates the costs of legislation, never considered one. Subsidies for customers with modest incomes represent a linchpin of the law\u2019s entire architecture.\n\nA simple technical corrections bill, specifying that consumers using the federal marketplace would receive subsidies as well, would resolve the ambiguity. But his fellow Republicans, Mr. Haskins says, will not \u201clift a finger\u201d to fix a law they loathe.\n\nOne reason is the fundamentally different partisan backdrops to the health and welfare debates. Mr. Clinton had campaigned on promises of welfare reform, traditionally a Republican priority, to brand himself \u201ca different kind of Democrat\u201d at a time when his party was struggling to compete in presidential elections.\n\nThat set up Mr. Clinton\u2019s compromise with a Republican-led Congress. On health care, by contrast, a Democratic president pushed a longstanding priority of his party through a Democratic-controlled Congress.\n\nAnother reason is the rightward ideological shift in the Republican Party. The health law pushed by Mr. Obama strongly resembled a plan that Republican leaders themselves once proposed as an alternative to the 1993 plan that Mr. Clinton had offered in vain.\n\nRepublicans unanimously opposed Mr. Obama anyway, with a zeal that has not ebbed four years later.\n\n\u201cIn the old days, like when I ran Medicare, when we had this kind of conflict in what appeared to be the intent versus the actual wording, we would go in and ask Congress for a rifle shot to clarify in the statute what needed to be said,\u201d said Gail R. Wilensky, a Republican health care expert who served in the administration of President George Bush.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nInstead, House Republicans who have repeatedly voted to repeal \u201cObamacare\u201d vow to try again with the new Republican majority in the Senate. And a dispute that legislative aides once would have resolved with minor editing has been turned over to Supreme Court justices.\n\n\u201cIn my experience there\u2019s never been a controversial major piece of legislation that didn\u2019t get followed by a technical change,\u201d said Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California, who is retiring after a 40-year House career renowned for legislative craftsmanship.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s become very difficult to legislate on any subject,\u201d Mr. Waxman added. \u201cOn this one, it\u2019s become such a part of the ideology of the Republican Party. They never wanted to change the law. They just want to stop it.\u201d\n\nIt is just one example of how political polarization has compounded obstacles to action built into America\u2019s constitutional system. Ideological and partisan lines have hardened and merged to form mutually reinforcing walls of division.\n\nFrustration over the consequences underlies Mr. Obama\u2019s determination to alter the immigration system with a stroke of his pen \u2014 which in turn promises to exacerbate those divisions.\n\nMs. Wilensky holds out hope that the court might yet prod Congress to act. If a majority of justices call on lawmakers to resolve the ambiguity, she reasoned, Republicans might then salvage the challenged subsidies in return for changes such as curbing health-care mandates on employers.\n\nThat may be wishful thinking.\n\n\u201cThe kind of changes that Gail is talking about come from a mentality about negotiation between the two parties that used to be the rule here in Washington,\u201d said Henry J. Aaron, a policy analyst at the Brookings Institution who served in Mr. Clinton\u2019s administration.\n\n\u201cPeople of good will on both sides got together, they didn\u2019t always agree, they worked out their differences and they dealt with problems,\u201d Mr. Aaron said. \u201cThat is all too regrettably now missing from the scene here.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news",
