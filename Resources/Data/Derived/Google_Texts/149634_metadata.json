Yet, a new classification from the state caused Empowerment Services to run up massive deficits and drop clients.\n\n\u201cIf they never would\u2019ve shown up, we would\u2019ve been happy and worked with what we had,\u201d said John Horton, whose son is a client at Empowerment Services. \u201cIt was a really short time between saying \u2018you get the whole world\u2019 and \u2018no, now you don\u2019t.\u2019 It\u2019s killing us right now.\u201d\n\nThe program is now operating at a deficit of $10,000 a month. Owner Marie Johnson says unless the state makes exceptions for the program or clients, Empowerment Services could be closed by May.\n\nEmpowerment Services\n\nEmpowerment Services caters to adults with various degrees of Autism who have been turned away from most other places. It is one of the only in the state that provides such services in a one-on-one facility. Many parents have told Johnson without Empowerment Services, their child would have no place to go. Horton said it is a lifeline for his 24-year-old son.\n\n\u201cThey take people who are kicked out of other programs for being too autistic or school districts who don\u2019t want to deal with them,\u201d Horton said. \u201cEmpowerment Services is their last hope.\u201d\n\nJohnson started the program after years of working with autistic children in the education system. She realized after children graduated, there were few resources to help them learn to cope with society.\n\nIn Empowerment Services, Johnson and her team build unique plans to help adults adjust towards independence. Most of the clients have demanding behavioral issues, which require one-on-one attention inside the facility.\n\nThe program is funded by federal funds awarded to the client, handled through outside brokerage firms.\n\nThe K-Plan\n\nIn 2013, Oregon was one of the few states to implement the K Plan\u2014a new Medicaid state program authorized under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cPeople are able to access more services if they needed new services,\u201d said Lilia Teninty, Director of the Oregon Office of Developmental Disabilities Services (ODDS). \u201cMost importantly, we are serving a significantly larger number of children and adults.\u201d\n\nTeninty explained the new program makes an assessment on a case-by-case basis, to determine how much funding will be given for services. K Plan created more funding for more children and adults and allowed an individualized funding plan instead of a flat bundled rate.\n\nWhen Johnson first heard of the new plan, she began hiring new staff to cover all the new pay hours she assumed would be allotted.\n\nHowever, last fall she learned the state classified her as a facility where one employee would oversee up to eight to ten clients. Yet for Empowerment Services\u2019 one-on-one methods, the system did not work.\n\n\u201cRight now, we are making $8.15 an hour on some clients,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWe can\u2019t provide support at that rate and it doesn\u2019t cover overheads like workman\u2019s comp, insurance, rent, and supplies.\u201d\n\nOregon is the only state to completely implement the K-Plan. Over the last two years, the state has been evaluating thousands of adults and children under the new standards.\n\nLarry Deal is the executive director for Independence NW , which acts as a broker between the government and clients. He said the K Plan has righted some wrongs in the system and added more funds overall. Yet because it is such a massive change with no precedent, implementation has been a difficult process.\n\n\u201cSome services have benefited financially from the changes. Others have had to rethink things,\u201d Deal said. \u201cYou\u2019re looking at a complete system overhaul. It\u2019s a learning process.\u201d\n\nFight For Classification\n\nJohnson and many parents have been trying for the last few months for the state to make an exception for Empowerment Services or its clients, so the resource can stay open.\n\nODDS has said this is a unique case and is reviewing the funds awarded for each client. However, Johnson said the appeal process has consumed a lot of time and manpower, and produced few results.\n\n\u201cWe are holding on by a thread,\u201d Johnson wrote in an email to ODDS. \u201cI am not clear why your tour, video clips, exception letters by Empowerment Services, exception requests done by PAs, parent letters, a candid interview between parents and your team, as well as an interview with myself does not suffice? What else could you possibly need?\u201d\n\nTeninty said ODDS will be meeting with Empowerment Services soon and working with them on ways to alter their business model to adapt to the new process.\n\n\u201cThey do provide a very unique service, and support some clients with specific needs,\u201d Teninty said. \u201cBut we we do have providers who service those needs\u2014they just look at it differently.\u201d\n\nTrying To Move Forward\n\nThe changes over the last few months have been creating a strain on the business, Johnson said. Employees have been putting in numerous volunteer hours to keep up with the workload, while Johnson said they have had to revamp their programs, billing process, and schedules.\n\nYet clients at Empowerment Services have been affected most by the change. Johnson said behavior incidents have gone up, as more clients are forced into group situations they are not prepared for. She has also had to to turn away clients.\n\n\u201cIt goes against my grain because I don\u2019t believe only people who can afford it should get help,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cEverybody is entitled to good service.\u201d\n\nPatty Moran\u2019s son Brian has been going to Empowerment Services for two and half years. During his time there, Moran said he has progressed to a place of greater independence and peace of mind. The unique setting of Empowerment Services created a way for him to improve his confidence, health, and security to a level Moran said he never would\u2019ve reached without Empowerment Services.\n\n\u201cWithout them, this never would\u2019ve happened,\u201d Moran said. \u201cIf they take it away, I\u2019m afraid he will regress\u2014I know he will. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important they continue.\u201d\n\nRelated Slideshow: 20 Oregon Hospitals That Charge The Most\n\nEnjoy this post?
