President Barack Obama celebrated the end of 2013 with a low-key foray to buy a cherry and lemon-lime \"shave ice\" in his native Hawaii before retreating to a vacation rental.\n\n\n\nIn San Francisco, one of the last major cities in the world to see the clock strike midnight, thousands saw waterfront fireworks illuminate the Golden Gate Bridge.\n\n\n\nTo the north, in a foggy Seattle, huge crowds gathered for a fireworks display launched from the Space Needle tower.\n\n\n\nIn Los Angeles, long notorious for lacking a centralised New Year's Eve celebration befitting its association with glitz and glamour, organisers pulled together a free outdoor arts and music festival in and around downtown's Grand Park.\n\n\n\nSYDNEY, DUBAI, LONDON\n\n\n\nNineteen hours earlier, a massive fireworks display lit up the sky around the Harbor Bridge and Opera House in Sydney, Australia. In the Middle East, Dubai broke the Guinness World Record for the largest fireworks display, the website Emirates247 reported.\n\n\n\nIn London, edible banana confetti and strawberry mist rained from the sky as fireworks along the River Thames lit up Big Ben and other landmarks.\n\n\n\nAcross the United States, 2014 ushered in political changes and the official start of a slate of new laws.\n\n\n\nNew York City's new mayor, Bill de Blasio, was sworn in at midnight in a private ceremony at his home in Brooklyn, succeeding Michael Bloomberg, who left office after 12 years. He was due to be formally inaugurated later at City Hall.\n\nAmericans who have signed up for new healthcare coverage under President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act were due to begin receiving benefits on Jan. 1.\n\n\n\nBefore ushering in 2014, Sotomayor, the U.S. Supreme Court Justice, granted Roman Catholic-affiliated groups a temporary exemption from a part of the Obamacare healthcare law that requires employers to provide insurance policies covering contraception.\n\n\n\nAlso starting New Year's Day, Colorado residents were legally permitted to buy an ounce of marijuana at a time from specially regulated retailers.\n\n\n\nPossession, cultivation and private personal consumption of marijuana by adults has already been legal in Colorado for more than a year.\n\n\n\n\"It will be like people waiting in line for tickets to a Pink Floyd concert,\" said Justin Jones, 39, owner of Dank Colorado in Denver, who has run a medical marijuana shop for four years and now has a recreational pot license.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "New Yorkers shrug off freezing temperatures", "author": "System Administrator", "og": {"site_name": "Emirates 24|7", "description": "New Yorkers shrug off freezing temperatures", "title": "2014 ushered in with fireworks and fruit mist", "locale": "en_GB", "image": "http://cache.emirates247.com/polopoly_fs/1.533216.1452550499!/image/image.gif", "url": "http://www.emirates247.com/news/region/2014-ushered-in-with-fireworks-and-fruit-mist-2014-01-01-1.533215", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "New Yorkers shrug off freezing temperatures", "title": "2014 ushered in with fireworks and fruit mist", "url": "http://www.emirates247.com/news/region/2014-ushered-in-with-fireworks-and-fruit-mist-2014-01-01-1.533215", "image": {"src": "http://cache.emirates247.com/polopoly_fs/1.533216.1452550499!/image/image.gif"}, "creator": "@Emirates247", "site": "@Emirates247", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Emirates 24|7", "iphone": "Emirates 24|7", "googleplay": "Emirates 24|7"}, "id": {"ipad": 786224961, "iphone": 786224961, "googleplay": "com.emirates247"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "alexaVerifyID": "cpWRiGeguXPAy-a1KZErjqqRH-w", "robots": "ACAP allow-index", "last-modified": "2016-05-19 16:30:44 GST", "fb": {"admins": 100000283387143, "page_id": 136509933034734, "app_id": 132782903460978}, "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "msvalidate.01": "97B560A2BDDF76982EF1BBF2E5F4DE45", "google-site-verification": "gvGASCnV8iZTJPFdQv6c1D7_EB5BTyiF0sCBN-Cy20g", "y_key": "2e2a4541c87dc829", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2273\"", "article_summary": "Crew members on board the International Space Station orbiting the globe sent greetings to the Times Square crowd.\nIn Nashville, Tennessee, revellers saw the \"Music Note Drop\" backed up by musical performances, including by Hank Williams Jr., and fireworks.\nSeveral hours before the ball dropped in Times Square, two men were slashed at a nearby bus station in what a Port Authority spokesman said was a dispute over tickets.\nFrom Sydney to London to San Francisco, revelers welcomed 2014 with extravagant fireworks displays, giant street parties and, in a new departure, fruit-flavoured mist.\nResidents in Vincennes, Indiana, didn't let the cold stop their fifth annual Watermelon Drop and Fireworks - a nod to the area's agricultural roots."}
