Radio icon and “American Top 40″ host Casey Kasem died early Sunday morning, according to an announcement from his publicist and a Facebook post from his family.

“Early this Father’s Day morning, our dad Casey Kasem passed away surrounded by family and friends,” according to the post written by Kasem’s family. “Even though we know he is in a better place and no longer suffering, we are heartbroken. Thank you for all your love, support and prayers. The world will miss Casey Kasem, an incredible talent and humanitarian; we will miss our Dad.”

Kasem struggled with Parkinson’s disease and dementia for years, and is reported to have died from complications related to Lewy body disease, one of the most common causes of dementia.
