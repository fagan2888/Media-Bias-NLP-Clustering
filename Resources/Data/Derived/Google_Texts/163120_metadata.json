Billions\u2014hundreds of billions\u2014have been made by individuals on Wall Street.\n\nMeanwhile, over 60,000 factories have closed in United States just in the past 14 years, and over 50 million Americans are either unemployed or underemployed.\n\nIn Europe, with the exception of the Scandinavian countries who are ignoring our economic advice, the situation is very similar. Other then Germany, which is becoming a major extractor of wealth from the rest of the EU, European countries and Great Britain are following the same fallacy that has been driving U.S. economic policy for more than 30 years.\n\nThe Financial Times lead their front page on June 29 with the warning that \u201c\u2018Europhic\u2019 Capital Markets Are Out of Step With Reality, Warns BIS.\u201d\n\nThe article notes that capital markets are \u201cextraordinarily buoyant,\u201d according to the Bank for International Settlements, and argues that central banks around the world \u201cshould not fall into the trap of raising rates \u2018too slowly and too late.'\u201d\n\nThey correctly point out how low interest rates have caused an explosion worldwide of corporate debt.\n\nThough it\u2019s not noted in the article, for-profit corporate banks have also discovered that instead of lending money to working-class people to buy homes or cars, it has become more profitable to simply borrow from central banks at very low interest rates, often less than 1%, and then park that money in government treasuries which pay 2% or 3%\u2014in effect loaning the country\u2019s money back to the same government at a profit.\n\nSimilarly, huge transnational corporations from tech companies to pharmaceutical companies are hoarding cash in offshore tax havens where it\u2019s not available to stimulate local economies, or are making acquisitions based on fiscal strategies rather than how to best manufacture the best product.\n\nCompletely lost in the debate between the BIS and the IMF over stimulative central bank strategies is a simple economic fact. Economies are driven by demand, and the principal component of demand is wages.\n\nInstead, the Financial Times noted that the Bank for International Settlements is \u201ccalling for policymakers to halt the steady rise of debt burdens around the world and embark on reforms to boost productivity.\u201d\n\nThis echoes the old Reaganomics line that increased productivity equals a growing economy. Make more things and people will buy more things.\n\nProductivity has been rising steadily in the United States since the 1930s, but since the early 1980s it has become uncoupled from wages, which have remained flat or fallen.\n\nEven as individual companies become more productive, producing more goods with lower costs and less labor, the economy has been stagnant because there is little demand for those goods. And that\u2019s because of the simple Econ 101 maxim, dating back to Adam Smith: demand is what drives economies, and wages are the principal driver of demand.", "article_metadata": {"description": "While profits soar, wages continue to stagnate and anti-tax zealots gut the safety net \u2014\u00a0a recipe for disaster", "author": "Thom Hartmann", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "While profits soar, wages continue to stagnate and anti-tax zealots gut the safety net \u2014\u00a0a recipe for disaster", "title": "The next great financial crash: How our corporate overlords are setting us up to fail (again)", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/07/04/the_next_great_financial_crash_how_our_corporate_overlords_are_setting_us_up_to_fail_again/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/wolf_wall_street4.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "While profits soar, wages continue to stagnate and anti-tax zealots gut the safety net \u2014\u00a0a recipe for disaster", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/wolf_wall_street4.jpg", "title": "The next great financial crash: How our corporate overlords are setting us up to fail (again)", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "The next great financial crash: How our corporate overlords are setting us up to fail (again)", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, AlterNet, Debt, Economics, Finance, Financial Crisis, U.S. Economy, Wall Street", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0ff9\"", "article_summary": "Topics: AlterNet, Debt, Economics, Finance, Financial Crisis, U.S. Economy, Wall Street, Business News, News, Politics NewsThis article originally appeared on AlterNetThe denial of fundamental economic principles is setting the world up for another Great Crash.\nIn Europe, with the exception of the Scandinavian countries who are ignoring our economic advice, the situation is very similar.\nEconomies are driven by demand, and the principal component of demand is wages.\n'\u201dThey correctly point out how low interest rates have caused an explosion worldwide of corporate debt.\nAnd that\u2019s because of the simple Econ 101 maxim, dating back to Adam Smith: demand is what drives economies, and wages are the principal driver of demand."}
