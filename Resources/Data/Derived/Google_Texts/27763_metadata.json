To investigate, they enrolled a number of volunteers in an experiment with ultrasound and electroencephalography (EEG) imaging technology. Immediately after stimulating a subject\u2019s median nerve with a small electrode, the researchers delivered focused ultrasound to the area of the brain that handles information from that particular nerve. They then use the EEG data to evaluate the reaction.\n\nAs expected, the focused ultrasound suppressed the brain waves responsible for encoding the information, causing the EEG signal to weaken. To gauge the participants\u2019 conscious response to this, they also administered two classic neurological tests: the two-point discrimination test, which measures a person\u2019s ability to determine whether two objects touching the skin are really two distinct points; and the frequency discrimination task, in which subjects have to assess differences in frequency throughout a series of light air puffs. Both tests are designed to evaluate the brain\u2019s ability to detect minute differences and modulations.\n\nThe team found that, although the EEG signal indicated weaker brain signals, the physical response appeared to be heightened. Intriguingly, once ultrasound was delivered to the appropriate brain area, the subjects became significantly better at both of the tasks. \"Our observations surprised us,\" said Tyler. \"Even though the brain waves associated with the tactile stimulation had weakened, people actually got better at detecting differences in sensations.\"\n\nMapping the Mind\n\nAlthough it is not perfectly clear why a drop in brain activity leads to a more accurate physical response, the team theorizes that the temporary boost is the result of an imbalance. \"It seems paradoxical, but we suspect that the particular ultrasound waveform we used in the study alters the balance of synaptic inhibition and excitation between neighboring neurons within the cerebral cortex,\" Tyler said. \"We believe focused ultrasound changed the balance of ongoing excitation and inhibition processing sensory stimuli in the brain region targeted and that this shift prevented the spatial spread of excitation in response to stimuli resulting in a functional improvement in perception.\"\n\nThe current study is the latest in a growing series of efforts to enhance cognitive functions with new technology. Another example is a University of Southern California study published last year, in which researchers show that a new brain prosthesis could soon be used to enhance memory in patients with cognitive deficiencies like dementia. As our understanding of the brain\u2019s wiring schedules becomes more and more sophisticated, scientists are constantly identifying new potential targets for this type of mind-boosting.\n\n\"Gaining a better understanding of how pulsed ultrasound affects the balance of synaptic inhibition and excitation in targeted brain regions \u2014 as well as how it influences the activity of local circuits versus long-range connections \u2014 will help us make more precise maps of the richly interconnected synaptic circuits in the human brain,\" first author Wynn Legon told reporters. \"We hope to continue to extend the capabilities of ultrasound for noninvasively tweaking brain circuits to help us understand how the human brain works.\"\n\nSource: Legon W, Sato TF, Opitz A, Tyler WJ et al. \u201cTranscranial focused ultrasound modulates the activity of primary somatosensory cortex in humans.\u201d Nature Neuroscience. 2014.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "improve cognitive function, focused ultrasound, neuroscience, william jamie tyler,", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Focused ultrasound delivered to the right area boosts a person's functional response, a new study finds.", "title": "Improve Brain Function With Focused Ultrasound", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/focused-ultrasound-improves-cognitive-functions-neurological-tests-266932", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/12/cognitive-function.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Focused ultrasound delivered to the right area boosts a person's functional response, a new study finds.", "title": "Improve Brain Function With Focused Ultrasound", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/focused-ultrasound-improves-cognitive-functions-neurological-tests-266932", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/12/cognitive-function.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/12/cognitive-function.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Science/Tech", "published_time": "2014-01-12T17:54:40-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-12T17:54:38-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Focused ultrasound delivered to the right area boosts a person's functional response, a new study finds."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9d81\"", "article_summary": "\u201cTranscranial focused ultrasound modulates the activity of primary somatosensory cortex in humans.\u201d Nature Neuroscience.\nAs expected, the focused ultrasound suppressed the brain waves responsible for encoding the information, causing the EEG signal to weaken.\nImmediately after stimulating a subject\u2019s median nerve with a small electrode, the researchers delivered focused ultrasound to the area of the brain that handles information from that particular nerve.\nThe current study is the latest in a growing series of efforts to enhance cognitive functions with new technology.\nTo investigate, they enrolled a number of volunteers in an experiment with ultrasound and electroencephalography (EEG) imaging technology."}
