Democrats lack an effective \u201cnational advertising campaign,\u201d said former President Bill Clinton after the election.\n\nBut some Democrats are beginning to question the message itself, wondering if they have the right policy priorities, with Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and southern Democrats showing particular concern their party has suffered for not making the economy its top priority.\n\nSchumer even explicitly said Democrats need to focus on policies that are \u201cmore than just messaging bills.\u201d\n\nAs WND reported, much of the criticism from leftists before the election had been directed at the leadership style of the top Democrat, President Obama, who has a reputation among even some of his own supporters for aloofness and finger-pointing.\n\nAmong the criticisms:\n\nTina Brown, former Newsweek Editor: \u201cObama\u2019s like that guy in the corner office who\u2019s too cool for school, calls a meeting, says this has to change, doesn\u2019t put anything in place to make sure it does change. Then it goes wrong, and he\u2019s blaming everybody.\u201d\n\nLeon Panetta, former CIA director and defense secretary: \u201cToo often, in my view, the president relies on the logic of the law professor rather than the passion of a leader.\u201d\n\nPaul Begala, Democrat strategist: \u201cThis is Politics 101: Always make it about the voters, not about yourself \u2026 I don\u2019t understand it. It was an unforced error at a time we can ill afford them\u201d (after Obama claimed the election was a referendum on his policies).\n\nPat Cadell, Democrat pollster: \u201cOur president is so disengaged. I mean, it\u2019s all pizza and, you know, pool and political cash. He has checked out as being president, as a leader.\u201d\n\nBob Just, Democrat activist and talk-show host: \u201cIt may be that President Obama\u2019s disastrous leadership will be the wake-up call we needed to realize the wrong people are running our party.\u201d\n\nBut the Democrats\u2019 self-criticism may be shifting from style to substance.\n\nAs WND reported last week, a number of Democrats thought it was a bad idea for the president to grant amnesty to an estimated five million illegal immigrants without the consent of Congress. Among the Democrat lawmakers who felt Congress should have had a hand in constructing immigration policy through the legislative process were: Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.V.; Claire McCaskill, D-Mo.; Heidi Heitkanp, D-N.D.; Jon Tester, D-Mont.; Tom Carper, D-Del.; and Al Franken, D-Minn.\n\nBut the greatest introspection appears to be coming from those who believe Democrats have erred in not making the economy their top policy priority.\n\nClinton campaign strategist James Carville famously warned his staff in 1992, \u201cIt\u2019s the economy, stupid,\u201d and now, more Democrats seem to be harkening back to that advice to put the priority on pocketbooks.\n\nSchumer set off a bit of a firestorm among party faithful on Monday when he said in a speech to the National Press Club that Democrats made a mistake in 2010 by passing Obamacare instead of focusing more on improving the economy.\n\nThe 2008 election gave Democrats control of both the White House and Congress and the freedom to pass virtually any legislation they desired, but, Schumer regretted, \u201cWe took their (voters\u2019) mandate and put all our focus on the wrong problem \u2013 health care reform.\u201d\n\nSchumer supports Obamacare, \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t the change we were hired to make\u201d in 2008.\n\nSome infuriated Democrats shot back that they had, in fact, addressed the economy first, by passing a $787 stimulus program over a GOP filibuster.\n\nBut even Obama admitted last month it was, \u201c[I]ndisputable that millions of Americans don\u2019t yet feel enough of the benefits of a growing economy where it matters most \u2013 and that\u2019s in their own lives.\u201d\n\nMany economists say, while the recovery has been good for Wall Street, it has not come to Main Street. They blame that on the proliferation of part-time jobs, stagnant wages and an actual drop in the median income of U.S. household over five years of supposed recovery.\n\nAccording to a U.S. Census Bureau report issued in September, the household median income was $51,900 in 2013. That\u2019s eight percent lower than in 2007, the year before the recession began, and would appear to go a long way toward explaining why millions of Americans \u201cdon\u2019t yet feel enough of the benefits of a growing economy.\u201d\n\nAnd now, Southern Democrats are joining Schumer and those who say the party has veered off course by ignoring the economy.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need a new Coke formula,\u201d Mississippi Democratic Party Chairman Rickey Cole told the Associated Press. \u201cThe problem is, we\u2019ve been out there trying to peddle Tab and RC Cola.\u201d\n\nCole said, particularly in the South, identity issues do not play well. The party\u2019s emphasis on such issues as gay rights, minority voting rights, women\u2019s rights and immigration does not resonate with voters there.\n\n\u201cThose people who don\u2019t see themselves in those groups say, \u2018What have the Democrats got for me?'\u201d he observed.\n\nGeorgia state Sen. Vincent Ford lamented, \u201cNo real economic message got through.\u201d\n\nAnd, Louisiana state Sen. J.P. Morrell, explained, \u201cYou have to articulate why the economic policies we advocate as Democrats actually benefit people on the ground.\u201d\n\nFinding that economic message may prove tricky, especially now that voters have given control of the congressional purse strings to the GOP.\n\nRepublicans largely favor reducing regulations, lowering taxes and cutting spending to stimulate economic growth, whereas Schumer offered raising the minimum wage, adding more pro-union labor laws and signing trade agreements.\n\nWhether the Democrats\u2019 problem is the message or the messenger, the party\u2019s disarray has been increasingly on public display and their ire has tended to focus on the man at the top, the president.\n\nLast month, WND published a list of more than 40 prominent Democrats and other leftists who had very publicly expressed everything from outrage to irritation with Obama.\n\nAnd now, it appears the president\u2019s own right-hand man can be added to that list of those he has upset.\n\nAides to Vice President Joseph Biden leaked word to the press on Monday that he was \u201cticked off\u201d by the humiliating way Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel was forced to resign after less than two years on the job.\n\nAn administration official told Politico that Biden scowled as he received the news in the State Dining Room.\n\nBiden is widely believed to be considering a run for president in 2016.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Democrats surveying the wreckage of their midterm election disaster are trying to figure out what went wrong, and the question largely has been: Is it the message or the messenger?
