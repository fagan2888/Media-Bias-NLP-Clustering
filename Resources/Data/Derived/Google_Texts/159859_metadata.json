The Pentagon Shrugs Its Shoulders\n\n\u201cNot only did the Afghan National Army refuse the contractor, ITSI, a U.S. company, access to the site for about a year, but other delays, such as weather, security, and funding issues, emerged,\u201d the report states.\n\nThe report is just the latest example of what has been a steady stream, bordering on a flood, of instances in which the U.S. has mismanaged funds in the nearly 15-year conflict in Afghanistan, which has cost the country about $1 trillion and counting.\n\nAfter six visits, SIGAR determined that while the ministry\u2019s building was \u201cwell-built,\u201d there were still \u201cseveral construction issues,\u201d including ones that could impair the structure\u2019s ability to survive an earthquake or even a significant amount of rain.\n\nRelated: How Millions of Taxpayer Dollars Were Wasted on Afghan Mining Projects\n\nDespite the drawbacks, the Combined Security Transition Command-Afghanistan (CSTC-A) transferred ownership to the Afghanis on Dec. 28, 2015. But as of Jan. 7, the building wasn\u2019t fully occupied, the report notes.\n\nThe ballooned price tag and delays are eerily reminiscent of the work done by now-defunct U.S. Defense Department task force accused of wasting millions of taxpayer dollars in its efforts to rebuild Afghanistan's economy.\n\nRelated: The $43 Million Afghan Gas Station Scandal Blows the Lid Off Pentagon Waste\n\nThe disbanded group, known as the Task Force for Business and Stability Operations (TFBSO), has come under intense scrutiny after a series of scathing SIAGR reports found it wasted millions building a natural gas station in the war-torn country and $150 million on private villas.\n\nA Senate Armed Services Committee subpanel held a hearing focused on the task force last month where questions from lawmakers were met with a shrug from a senior Pentagon official.\n\nThe Defense Department isn\u2019t off the hook, though. Earlier this month, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) fired off a letter to the Pentagon that asked 23 questions about the task force, including how Congress appropriated $800 million for TFBSO, but only $638 million was spent.\n\n\u201cPlease document what happened to the $182 million in unexpended appropriations and whether expired funds were returned to the Treasury, as required by law, or were reprogrammed by Congress for other purposes,\u201d Grassley said in the missive to Defense Secretary Ash Carter.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The United States spent $154.7 million, three times the original estimate, to build the Afghan Ministry of Defense Headquarters in Kabul, according to a top federal watchdog.", "title": "$106 Million in Cost Overruns for Another Pentagon Project in Afghanistan", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/18/106-Million-Cost-Overruns-Another-Pentagon-Project-Afghanistan", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/afghanistan-blast-kabul_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/18/106-Million-Cost-Overruns-Another-Pentagon-Project-Afghanistan", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/afghanistan-blast-kabul_2.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The United States spent $154.7 million, three times the original estimate, to build the Afghan Ministry of Defense Headquarters in Kabul, according to a top federal watchdog.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "A Senate Armed Services Committee subpanel held a hearing focused on the task force last month where questions from lawmakers were met with a shrug from a senior Pentagon official.\nEarlier this month, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) fired off a letter to the Pentagon that asked 23 questions about the task force, including how Congress appropriated $800 million for TFBSO, but only $638 million was spent.\nRelated: Where Did $800 Million in Afghan Aid Go?\nThe United States has spent $154.7 million, three times the original estimate, to build the Afghan Ministry of Defense headquarters in Kabul, according to a top federal watchdog.\nThe ballooned price tag and delays are eerily reminiscent of the work done by now-defunct U.S. Defense Department task force accused of wasting millions of taxpayer dollars in its efforts to rebuild Afghanistan's economy."}
