But Americans consistently give him the highest approval rating of any president since Franklin D. Roosevelt. Why?\n\nAmong the many monuments to John F. Kennedy, perhaps the most striking is the Sixth Floor Museum in Dallas, in the building that was once the Texas School Book Depository. Every year, nearly 350,000 people visit the place where Lee Harvey Oswald waited on November 22, 1963, to shoot at the president\u2019s motorcade. The museum itself is an oddity because of its physical connection to the event it illuminates; the most memorable\u2014and eeriest\u2014moment of a visit to the sixth floor is when you turn a corner and face the window through which Oswald fired his rifle as Kennedy\u2019s open car snaked through Dealey Plaza\u2019s broad spaces below. The windows are cluttered once again with cardboard boxes, just as they had been on that sunny afternoon when Oswald hid there. Visitors from all over the world have signed their names in the memory books, and many have written tributes: \u201cOur greatest President.\u201d \u201cOh how we miss him!\u201d \u201cThe greatest man since Jesus Christ.\u201d At least as many visitors write about the possible conspiracies that led to JFK\u2019s assassination. The contradictory realities of Kennedy\u2019s life don\u2019t match his global reputation. But in the eyes of the world, this reticent man became a charismatic leader who, in his life and in his death, served as a symbol of purpose and hope.\n\nPresident Kennedy spent less than three years in the White House. His first year was a disaster, as he himself acknowledged. The Bay of Pigs invasion of Communist Cuba was only the first in a series of failed efforts to undo Fidel Castro\u2019s regime. His 1961 summit meeting in Vienna with the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev was a humiliating experience. Most of his legislative proposals died on Capitol Hill. Yet he was also responsible for some extraordinary accomplishments. The most important, and most famous, was his adept management of the Cuban missile crisis in 1962, widely considered the most perilous moment since World War II. Most of his military advisers\u2014and they were not alone\u2014believed the United States should bomb the missile pads that the Soviet Union was stationing in Cuba. Kennedy, aware of the danger of escalating the crisis, instead ordered a blockade of Soviet ships. In the end, a peaceful agreement was reached. Afterward, both Kennedy and Khrushchev began to soften the relationship between Washington and Moscow. Kennedy, during his short presidency, proposed many important steps forward. In an address at American University in 1963, he spoke kindly of the Soviet Union, thereby easing the Cold War. The following day, after almost two years of mostly avoiding the issue of civil rights, he delivered a speech of exceptional elegance, and launched a drive for a civil-rights bill that he hoped would end racial segregation. He also proposed a voting-rights bill and federal programs to provide health care to the elderly and the poor. Few of these proposals became law in his lifetime\u2014a great disappointment to Kennedy, who was never very successful with Congress. But most of these bills became law after his death\u2014in part because of his successor\u2019s political skill, but also because they seemed like a monument to a martyred president. Kennedy was the youngest man ever elected to the presidency, succeeding the man who, at the time, was the oldest. He symbolized\u2014as he well realized\u2014a new generation and its coming-of-age. He was the first president born in the 20th century, the first young veteran of World War II to reach the White House. John Hersey\u2019s powerful account of Kennedy\u2019s wartime bravery, published in The New Yorker in 1944, helped him launch his political career.\n\nIn shaping his legend, Kennedy\u2019s personal charm helped. A witty and articulate speaker, he seemed built for the age of television. To watch him on film today is to be struck by the power of his presence and the wit and elegance of his oratory. His celebrated inaugural address was filled with phrases that seemed designed to be carved in stone, as many of them have been. Borrowing a motto from his prep-school days, putting your country in place of Choate, he exhorted Americans: \u201cAsk not what your country can do for you\u2014ask what you can do for your country.\u201d Another contributor to the Kennedy legend, something deeper than his personal attractiveness, is the image of what many came to call grace. He not only had grace, in the sense of performing and acting gracefully; he was also a man who seemed to receive grace. He was handsome and looked athletic. He was wealthy. He had a captivating wife and children, a photogenic family. A friend of his, the journalist Ben Bradlee, wrote a 1964 book about Kennedy called That Special Grace. The Kennedys lit up the White House with writers, artists, and intellectuals: the famous cellist Pablo Casals, the poet Robert Frost, the French intellectual Andr\u00e9 Malraux. Kennedy had graduated from Harvard, and stocked his administration with the school\u2019s professors. He sprinkled his public remarks with quotations from poets and philosophers. The Kennedy family helped create his career and, later, his legacy. He could never have reached the presidency without his father\u2019s help. Joseph Kennedy, one of the wealthiest and most ruthless men in America, had counted on his first son, Joe Jr., to enter politics. When Joe died in the war, his father\u2019s ambitions turned to the next-oldest son. He paid for all of John\u2019s\u2014Jack\u2019s\u2014campaigns and used his millions to bring in supporters. He prevailed on his friend Arthur Krock, of The New York Times, to help Jack publish his first book, Why England Slept. Years later, when Kennedy wrote Profiles in Courage with the help of his aide Theodore Sorensen, Krock lobbied successfully for the book to win a Pulitzer Prize.\n\nThe Kennedy legacy has a darker side as well. Prior to his presidency, many of JFK\u2019s political colleagues considered him merely a playboy whose wealthy father had bankrolled his campaigns. Many critics saw recklessness, impatience, impetuosity. Nigel Hamilton, the author of JFK: Reckless Youth, a generally admiring study of Kennedy\u2019s early years, summed up after nearly 800 pages: He had the brains, the courage, a shy charisma, good looks, idealism, money \u2026 Yet, as always, there was something missing\u2014a certain depth or seriousness of purpose \u2026 Once the voters or the women were won, there was a certain vacuousness on Jack\u2019s part, a failure to turn conquest into anything very meaningful or profound. I. F. Stone, the distinguished liberal writer, observed in 1973: \u201cBy now he is simply an optical illusion.\u201d Kennedy\u2019s image of youth and vitality is, to some degree, a myth. He spent much of his life in hospitals, battling a variety of ills. His ability to serve as president was itself a profile in courage. Much has been written about Kennedy\u2019s covert private life. Like his father, he was obsessed with the ritual of sexual conquest\u2014before and during his marriage, before and during his presidency. While he was alive, the many women, the Secret Service agents, and the others who knew of his philandering kept it a secret. Still, now that the stories of his sexual activities are widely known, they have done little to tarnish his reputation. Half a century after his presidency, the endurance of Kennedy\u2019s appeal is not simply the result of a crafted image and personal charm. It also reflects the historical moment in which he emerged. In the early 1960s, much of the American public was willing, even eager, to believe that he was the man who would \u201cget the country moving again,\u201d at a time when much of the country was ready to move. Action and dynamism were central to Kennedy\u2019s appeal. During his 1960 presidential campaign, he kept sniping at the Republicans for eight years of stagnation: \u201cI have premised my campaign for the presidency on the single assumption that the American people are uneasy at the present drift in our national course \u2026 and that they have the will and the strength to start the United States moving again.\u201d As the historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., Kennedy\u2019s friend and adviser, later wrote, \u201cThe capital city, somnolent in the Eisenhower years, had suddenly come alive \u2026 [with] the release of energy which occurs when men with ideas have a chance to put them into practice.\u201d \u201cHe had the brains, the courage, a shy charisma, good looks, idealism, money \u2026 Yet, as always, there was something missing.\u201d Kennedy helped give urgency to the idea of pursuing a national purpose\u2014a great American mission. In the 15 years since World War II, ideological momentum had been slowly building in the United States, fueled by anxieties about the rivalry with the Soviet Union and by optimism about the dynamic performance of the American economy.\n\nWhen Kennedy won the presidency, the desire for change was still tentative, as his agonizingly thin margin over Richard Nixon suggests. But it was growing, and Kennedy seized the moment to provide a mission\u2014or at least he grasped the need for one\u2014even though it was not entirely clear what the mission was. Early in his tenure, a Defense Department official wrote a policy paper that expressed a curious mix of urgent purpose and vague goals: The United States needs a Grand Objective \u2026 We behave as if our real objective is to sit by our pools contemplating the spare tires around our middles \u2026 The key consideration is not that the Grand Objective be exactly right, it is that we have one and that we start moving toward it. This reflected John Kennedy\u2019s worldview, one of commitment, action, movement. Those who knew him realized, however, that he was more cautious than his speeches suggested. John F. Kennedy was a good president but not a great one, most scholars concur. A poll of historians in 1982 ranked him 13th out of the 36 presidents included in the survey. Thirteen such polls from 1982 to 2011 put him, on average, 12th. Richard Neustadt, the prominent presidential scholar, revered Kennedy during his lifetime and was revered by Kennedy in turn. Yet in the 1970s, he remarked: \u201cHe will be just a flicker, forever clouded by the record of his successors. I don\u2019t think history will have much space for John Kennedy.\u201d But 50 years after his death, Kennedy is far from \u201cjust a flicker.\u201d He remains a powerful symbol of a lost moment, of a soaring idealism and hopefulness that subsequent generations still try to recover. His allure\u2014the romantic, almost mystic, associations his name evokes\u2014not only survives but flourishes. The journalist and historian Theodore White, who was close to Kennedy, published a famous interview for Life magazine with Jackie Kennedy shortly after her husband\u2019s assassination, in which she said: At night, before we\u2019d go to sleep, Jack liked to play some records; and the song he loved most came at the very end of this record. The lines he loved to hear were: Don\u2019t let it be forgot, that once there was a spot, for one brief shining moment that was known as Camelot. And thus a lyric became the lasting image of his presidency.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Historians tend to rate JFK as a good president, not a great one.
