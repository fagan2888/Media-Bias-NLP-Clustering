His ambitious and progressive platform \u2013 including single-payer health care and free college tuition \u2013 isn\u2019t cheap, and a Sanders administration wouldn\u2019t try to simply add the costs to the national debt.\n\nBut the New York Times reported yesterday that some \u201cliberal-leaning economists\u201d who share Sanders\u2019 goals have begun to \u201cquestion his numbers.\u201d Austan Goolsbee, formerly chairman of President Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, now at the University of Chicago, told the Times that the Sanders campaign\u2019s numbers \u201cdon\u2019t remotely add up.\u201d\n\nWhen one progressive analyst called Sanders\u2019 platform \u201cpuppies and rainbows,\u201d Goolsbee said the assessment doesn\u2019t go nearly far enough. The numbers have actually \u201cevolved into magic flying puppies with winning Lotto tickets tied to their collars,\u201d the progressive economist added.\n\nAnd while that\u2019s a great quote, what really stood out for me was this\n\nJared Bernstein, the former economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. who is now at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, examined a paper by the economist advising Mr. Sanders, Gerald Friedman of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, that is circulating on the left. While calling Mr. Friedman\u2019s work a good effort, Mr. Bernstein cited several assumptions as \u201cwishful thinking.\u201d Among them were minimal health-cost inflation, economic growth reaching 5.3 percent and, in that heated-up economy, no action from the Federal Reserve to apply brakes.\n\nAnd that gives me pause.\n\nLast summer, Jeb Bush got the ball rolling on wishful economic thinking, vowing to create 4% GDP growth in his first term as president. The Florida Republican admitted at the time the figure wasn\u2019t based on any meaningful policy analysis; he just liked the sound of 4% growth, so it became a centerpiece of his campaign.\n\nOthers quickly chimed in. Chris Christie also promised 4% growth. Scott Walker said he could get that figure to 4.5%. None of these numbers related to anything other than bravado rhetoric; candidates were simply pulling numbers out of the air.\n\nTo be sure, Sanders is approaching the debate with greater seriousness \u2013 his numbers aren\u2019t just made up, for example \u2013 but he\u2019s nevertheless pointing to projections that are incredibly optimistic.\n\nIn order for Sanders\u2019 numbers to add up, he\u2019s expecting the economy to grow at 5.3%. To put that in perspective, how many modern presidents \u2013 from either party \u2013 have seen 4% growth during their tenures? None. Literally, not a single one. Not Clinton, not Obama, not Reagan, no one has achieved growth that high. If any of them did, it\u2019s awfully likely the Fed would raise interest rates, deliberately cooling growth out of inflationary fears.\n\nI\u2019ll gladly concede that many of Sanders\u2019 domestic priorities would help the economy enormously. I have no idea how some of these measures would get through Congress, but if the point is that investments in infrastructure, for example, will boost economic growth, I completely agree.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "If Bernie Sanders makes his agenda's numbers add up by assuming 5.3% growth, there's a problem with this plan.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/the-perils-wishful-thinking", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "If Bernie Sanders makes his agenda's numbers add up by assuming 5.3% growth, there's a problem with this plan.", "title": "The perils of 'wishful thinking'", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/the-perils-wishful-thinking", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/ap_281744431938.jpg?itok=Joozg7b1", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/the-perils-wishful-thinking", "image": {"width": 830, "identifier": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/ap_281744431938.jpg?itok=xeYoepx5", "height": 553}, "title": "The perils of 'wishful thinking'", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "If Bernie Sanders makes his agenda's numbers add up by assuming 5.3% growth, there's a problem with this plan."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2016-02-16T10:40:31-05:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "steve-benen", "title": "The perils of 'wishful thinking'", "tags": "bernie-sanders,election-2016,elections,gdp,rachel-maddow-show", "published": 1, "date": "02/16/2016 10:40:31 EST", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/the-perils-wishful-thinking"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/steve.benen"}, "abstract": "If Bernie Sanders makes his agenda's numbers add up by assuming 5.3% growth, there's a problem with this plan.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Elections, Election 2016, Bernie Sanders, GDP"}, "article_summary": "Last summer, Jeb Bush got the ball rolling on wishful economic thinking, vowing to create 4% GDP growth in his first term as president.\nIn order for Sanders\u2019 numbers to add up, he\u2019s expecting the economy to grow at 5.3%.\nI have no idea how some of these measures would get through Congress, but if the point is that investments in infrastructure, for example, will boost economic growth, I completely agree.\nWhile calling Mr. Friedman\u2019s work a good effort, Mr. Bernstein cited several assumptions as \u201cwishful thinking.\u201d Among them were minimal health-cost inflation, economic growth reaching 5.3 percent and, in that heated-up economy, no action from the Federal Reserve to apply brakes.\nThe numbers have actually \u201cevolved into magic flying puppies with winning Lotto tickets tied to their collars,\u201d the progressive economist added."}
