Aides said the president on Tuesday night will give his assessment of what the country looks like in 2016 and the direction he hopes it will take in the future.\n\nPresident Obama gives his State of the Union address last January before a joint session of Congress in Washington as Vice President Joe Biden and House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio listen. Out of time to push a new legislative agenda, a battle-hardened president, in his final State of the Union address, aims to define his presidency and his legacy before others can do it for him.

This year, he's promising a speech that celebrates America\u2019s capacity \u201cto come together as one American family.\u201d The Associated Press President Obama delivers his State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress on Jan. 20, 2015, in Washington.

Unemployment has fallen to 5 percent and renewed confidence in the economy has led the Federal Reserve to start raising interest rates.\n\nObama\u2019s chief of staff, Denis McDonough, said Obama planned in his speech to cite those achievements to argue that \u201cwe\u2019ve brought America back.\u201d\n\nWhile Obama wants to keep the momentum going, the presidential campaign may drown him out. The White House scheduled this year\u2019s speech earlier than usual, in part to ensure Obama had room to maneuver before voters get their first say \u2013 the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 1.\n\nTo the dismay of some in his party, Obama doesn\u2019t plan to use the address as an opening argument for Democratic candidates in the November election. White House officials said the president would have ample opportunities to frame the campaign.\n\nStill, anything Obama says or does in an election year raises the political heat. For example, Republicans have seized on Obama\u2019s unilateral moves to tighten gun policies, a topic for Tuesday\u2019s speech, as the latest example of why voters cannot trust Democrats.\n\nCAMPAIGNS RESPOND TO HIS BOLDNESS\n\n\u201cThe president hasn\u2019t had a problem getting attention for what he\u2019s proposed as important issues we should be focused on,\u201d said Jen Psaki, the White House communications director. She said those issues often have spilled over into the campaign. \u201cBecause of his decision to be bold, we fully anticipate that will continue.\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s best prospects for achievements this year are on issues where he and Congress at least partially agree. Central to his speech will be a renewed call for a criminal justice overhaul and for approval of the Asia-Pacific trade agreement, which many Republicans support.", "article_metadata": {"description": "He is expected to define his presidency and try to spark a burst of energy for his initiatives.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "description": "He is expected to define his presidency and try to spark a burst of energy for his initiatives.", "title": "Obama set to address his legacy in final State of the Union address - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 999, "identifier": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/780644_State-of-Union.JPEG-06ddd.jpg", "height": 666}, "updated_time": "2016-01-09T23:17:11-04:00", "url": "http://www.pressherald.com/2016/01/09/obama-set-to-address-his-legacy-in-final-state-of-the-union/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "He is expected to define his presidency and try to spark a burst of energy for his initiatives.", "creator": "@pressherald", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/780644_State-of-Union.JPEG-06ddd.jpg", "title": "Obama set to address his legacy in final State of the Union address - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "site": "@pressherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=951845858", "fb": {"admins": 769488179, "app_id": 178078215650057}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressherald", "section": "Nation & World", "published_time": "2016-01-09T17:46:19-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-09T23:17:11-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "QWs9pxQP8fwo2-nR5mWopc6qCK2D3920f7bl-U-zkso", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The Associated Press President Obama delivers his 2015 State of the Union address.\nPresident Obama gives his State of the Union address last January before a joint session of Congress in Washington as Vice President Joe Biden and House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio listen.\nOut of time to push a new legislative agenda, a battle-hardened president, in his final State of the Union address, aims to define his presidency and his legacy before others can do it for him.\nOut of time to push a new legislative agenda, President Obama will look past Congress and to the American people in his final State of the Union address, aiming to define his presidency and his legacy before others can do it for him.\nWhite House officials said the president would have ample opportunities to frame the campaign."}
