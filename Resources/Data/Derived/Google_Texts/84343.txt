Two brothers from Ophir survived a massive avalanche Wednesday in the San Miguel County backcountry after one of them was swept away and buried.

Alex Holmes, 27, saw his 26-year-old brother, Brian, get swept away by a giant avalanche while the two were skiing from Trout Lake to Ophir on a popular trail near Waterfall Canyon, according to a news release by Susan Lilly, spokeswoman for the San Miguel County Sheriff’s Department.

“Given the circumstances and nature of the slide, this skier is extremely fortunate,” said sheriff’s deputy Todd Rector, who led the rescue operation.

Alex Holmes was watching his brother begin to ski down the slope when Brian Holmes triggered an avalanche. Brian Holmes was swept out of sight in the Fatwa area, the news release says.

When Alex Holmes initially tried to ski down to search for his brother, he triggered a second avalanche. Feeling it wasn’t safe to continue, he skied back to Trout Lake and called for help.

Brian Holmes said he was able to dig himself out of the snow after being carried about 1,000 feet down the slide and landing on his back, mostly buried in snow.

His entire body except for his face and one arm were under the snow. It took him about 15 minutes to dig out. He then began searching for his brother, who he thought was dead.

Deputies were dispatched about 1 p.m.

During the ongoing mission, dispatchers received calls from a cellphone belonging to Brian Holmes. They heard someone breathing, but no further communication was established.

Brian Holmes made his way to the town of Ophir. He was taken to the Telluride Medical Center, where he was treated for injuries that were not life-threatening.

Rector said it was not surprising that an avalanche was triggered. “The San Juans in general can represent some of the most tenuous snow conditions on the continent,” Rector said.
