Indeed, spending in 2010 retention elections nationwide reached $5 million\u2014double the total spent in the previous decade.\n\n\u201cIt clearly sends a message to judges that, in the future, they should hesitate to issue an opinion that may be correct under the law \u2026 and yet is unpopular,\u201d Ternus said of her situation. \u201cThey\u2019re telling those judges to check the opinion polls on the issue and follow those rather than following the law.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a very dangerous message to be sending,\u201d she added.\n\nPariente faced her own reelection in 2012 alongside Justices Peggy Quince and R. Fred Lewis. With a career on the court beginning in 1997\u2014including a stint as chief justice from 2004 to 2006\u2014she played a role in several controversial cases, including Gore v. Harris (2000), ordering a statewide recount in the 2000 presidential election, and Bush v. Holmes (2006), ruling school vouchers unconstitutional.\n\nShe and her colleagues drew the ire of the state Republican Party and the Koch-funded group Americans for Prosperity, however, for ordering a retrial for convicted murderer Joe Nixon and for throwing out a proposed constitutional amendment that would have allowed Floridians to opt out of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s mandate for obtaining health insurance.\n\nThe trio survived the election, but not without a fight.\n\n\u201cCitizens, properly informed, did not want to transform the courts into a \u2018power grab\u2019 for one governor or one side or the other,\u201d she said. \u201cThey recognized separation of powers, checks and balances\u2014everything the National Constitution Center wants to emphasize.\u201d\n\nJudge Anna Blackburne-Rigsby of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, who currently serves as president of the National Association of Women Judges, offered a broader perspective on the difficult landscape faced by judges across the country.\n\n\u201cA lot of people just don\u2019t know a lot about the judiciary and what judges do every day\u2014until one of our loved ones, family members, [or] friends has to go into a courthouse. That is part of the problem,\u201d she explained. \u201cWhat judges and lawyers in the community need to do more is talk like this.\u201d\n\n\u201cJudicial independence \u2026 is not about the judge,\u201d she insisted. \u201cIt is about the community. It is about the people. It is about our democracy.\u201d\n\nYou can watch the full program below or by clicking here.\n\nFor more on the challenges facing America\u2019s judges, read our event preview.\n\nRecent Stories on Constitution Daily\n\nHere\u2019s your chance to \u2018Ask Jeff Rosen\u2019\n\nConstitution Check: Can an election district have too many minority voters in it?\n\nAnother act decided in Anna Nicole Smith\u2019s Supreme Court legacy\n\nSupreme Court tracker: A potential big week expected\n\nShare:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Constitution Daily", "description": "In a revealing conversation with the National Constitution Center\u2019s Jeffrey Rosen, three judges made an emphatic case for the value and necessity of independent courts.", "title": "Video: Are America\u2019s courts fair and free?", "url": "http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/2014/06/video-are-americas-courts-fair-and-free/", "image": "http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Judges-faircourts.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Judges-faircourts.jpg?w=240", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "fb": {"admins": 59543893235, "page_id": 59543893235, "app_id": 108483985888821}, "google-site-verification": "g-YRZSJfme1Aa6j71jlmtj3ZRUHZKtKda1U7n-deAIA", "msvalidate.01": "7A707BA806870C4CB077BE8CFB94D00F", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-11T21:14:46+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-11T21:16:26+00:00", "author": "http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/author/ncc/"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdafb\"", "article_summary": "Another act decided in Anna Nicole Smith\u2019s Supreme Court legacySupreme Court tracker: A potential big week expectedShare:EmailCommentscomments\nShare:EmailIn a revealing conversation with the National Constitution Center\u2019s Jeffrey Rosen, three judges made an emphatic case for the value and necessity of independent courts.\nFormer Chief Justice Marsha Ternus of the Iowa Supreme Court and Justice Barbara Pariente of the Florida Supreme Court recounted their respective reelection contests in which a well-financed opposition assailed them for unpopular decisions.\n\u201cThey recognized separation of powers, checks and balances\u2014everything the National Constitution Center wants to emphasize.\u201dJudge Anna Blackburne-Rigsby of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C.\nTernus, who was appointed to Iowa\u2019s highest court in 1993 and named chief justice in 2006, led a unanimous court that ruled the state\u2019s Defense of Marriage Act unconstitutional in 2009."}
