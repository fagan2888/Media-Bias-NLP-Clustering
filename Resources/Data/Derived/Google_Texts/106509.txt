By Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard – While the ACA seeks to help millions of uninsured Americans get quality, affordable coverage, the glitch-ridden launch of the online exchanges, and other coverage-related problems, have raised serious concerns.

People in Hawai‘i and across the country deserve leaders who have integrity, are accountable to the people, and who are ready to work together towards workable solutions.

Now is the time for us to come together, identify what needs to be fixed, and work to bring about those changes, such as ensuring people have a fair window of time to sign up once the website is fully functional, and guaranteeing the security and privacy of personal information that is submitted online.

A major piece of legislation like the ACA certainly will not be perfect from day one. Congress must work together to immediately pass targeted improvements that ensure the American people have access to good healthcare.

Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, a Democrat who represents Hawaii, voted against the repeal and defunding of the Affordable Care Act; and focused on targeted improvements to the law.
