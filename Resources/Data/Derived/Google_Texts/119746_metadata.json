Yet Cheney, flanked by his wife, Lynne, and their daughter, Liz, said Monday that the most important spending priority right now should be the military, \u201cnot food stamps, not highways or anything else,\u201d during a luncheon in D.C. sponsored by Politico.\n\nRelated: Congress Uses Accounting Gimmicks to Fund Highway Bill\n\nCheney, a critic of President Obama, unsurprisingly took one (of many) potshots at the president for \u201cdramatically reducing the military.\u201d Cheney called budget belt-tightening at the Pentagon \u201coutrageous.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour number one responsibility as president is to support and defend the Constitution of the United States,\u201d he told an audience of several hundred people. \u201cHe\u2019s the commander-in-chief and he\u2019s absolutely devastating the United States military today.\u201d\n\nCheney\u2019s comments come as the White House is aggressively pushing Congress to pass the expiring Highway Trust Fund. The Department of Transportation has already warned that it will begin cutting federal dollars to the states before the end of the month, putting scores of infrastructure projects, and many more construction jobs, at risk.\n\nOn Monday, the President\u2019s Council of Economic Advisors released a report detailing the country\u2019s lagging infrastructure in an effort to prod Congress to pass legislation to save the trust fund.\n\nThe report says about two-thirds of the country\u2019s roads are rated \u201cless than good,\u201d and one in four bridges requires significant repair. Some 45 percent of the population lacks access to transit, according to the report.\n\nIt also includes a state-by-state breakdown of what is at stake if Congress lets the Highway Trust Fund go broke. Virginia, for example, could lose 17,228 jobs and 6,596 transportation projects, the report said.\n\nRelated: Americans Face a Bumpy Road as Highway Bill Stalls\n\nThe president is trying to push a larger plan, estimated at $302 billion for transportation, which would close certain tax loopholes to fund infrastructure projects.\n\nCommittees in both the House and Senate, meanwhile, have approved versions of the highway bill extension to finance the trust fund into May of next year. Those would provide upwards of $11billion for transportation projects. The House expects to take up its version this week.\n\nTop Reads from the Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Though the battle over infrastructure spending is occupying much of Washington this we", "title": "Cheney: Forget Food Stamps and Highways.
