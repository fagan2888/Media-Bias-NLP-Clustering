The health care plans that have been cancelled are those that have not met the requirements of the Affordable Care Act and are considered \"substandard.\" In an interview with Chuck Todd of NBC, Obama said \"I am sorry that they are finding themselves in this situation based on assurances they got from me.\"The resulting uproar has sparked the introduction of several bills in Congress to at least delay, if not entirely bar, the cancelation of these plans.\n\nClinton took pains to emphasize that the Affordable Care Act was a good thing and an important step forward. Instead, his critcism of Obama seemed to be on messaging far more than on policy. After all, while the young man Clinton pointed to in his example was still getting better coverage through his new plan, he preferred his old one because it was cheaper. Clinton's critique was that Obama had made an obligation to the American people in stating \"if you like your plan, you can keep it\" and needed to follow through as a result.\n\nWith reports already circulating that the White House is considering an adminstrative fix to help those who have seen their plans cancelled under the Affordable Care Act, Clinton's critique seems to make such a rule change inevitable.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"pageNum": 1, "description": "Bill Clinton joined the chorus of detractors who think the White House should allow those losing their healthcare plans because of Obamacare to keep them.", "type": "house", "title": "Bill Clinton Reproaches Obama On ACA", "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2013/11/12/bill-clinton-reproaches-obama-on-the-aca", "twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "bencjacobs"}, "sectionTaxanomies": "washingtonbureau", "environment": "dev", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "Bill Clinton joined the chorus of detractors who think the White House should allow those losing their healthcare plans because of Obamacare to keep them.", "title": "Bill Clinton Reproaches Obama On ACA", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/11/12/bill-clinton-reproaches-obama-on-the-aca.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2013/11/12/bill-clinton-reproaches-obama-on-the-aca/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1384276073697.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authorIds": "/etc/authors/b/ben-jacobs", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "authors": "Ben Jacobs", "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/washingtonbureau", "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-12T16:32:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/ben-jacobshtml"}, "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Bill Clinton Reproaches Obama On ACA\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/11/12/bill-clinton-reproaches-obama-on-the-aca.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2013/11/12/bill-clinton-reproaches-obama-on-the-aca/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/46142535.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2013/11/12/bill-clinton-reproaches-obama-on-the-aca\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-11-12T16:32:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"Washington Bureau\",\"author\":\"Ben Jacobs\",\"tags\":[]}", "publicationDate": 201311121632}, "article_summary": "Clinton took pains to emphasize that the Affordable Care Act was a good thing and an important step forward.\nIn an interview with OZY.com, Bill Clinton chastised Barack Obama for failing to live up to the promise that, under the Affordable Care Act, \"if you like your plan, you can keep it.\"\nThe health care plans that have been cancelled are those that have not met the requirements of the Affordable Care Act and are considered \"substandard.\"\nTsk TskBill Clinton joined the chorus of detractors who think the White House should allow those losing their healthcare plans because of Obamacare to keep them.\nInstead, his critcism of Obama seemed to be on messaging far more than on policy."}
