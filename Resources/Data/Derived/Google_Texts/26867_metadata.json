In a crucial detail that Mr. Obama left out, the Citizenship and Immigration Services agency said it was immediately seeking 1,000 new employees to work in an office building to process \u201ccases filed as a result of the executive actions on immigration.\u201d\n\nThe likely cost: nearly $8 million a year in lease payments and more than $40 million for annual salaries.\n\nThe announcement of the new \u201coperational center\u201d among the chain restaurants and high-rises of Crystal City, a Northern Virginia neighborhood used for overflow from the federal agencies in Washington, offers a glimpse into how swiftly a president\u2019s words can produce bigger government. It also demonstrates the bureaucracy\u2019s ability to swing into action, even during an extended power struggle between the president and Congress.\n\n\u201cWhen you have an executive order, when you have a president saying, \u2018I want you to do this,\u2019 bureaucrats say, \u2018O.K., let\u2019s go do what the president says,\u2019\u201d said Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former White House official who worked on Vice President Al Gore\u2019s \u201creinventing government\u201d initiative.\n\nAlthough conservatives in Congress are vowing to attack the president\u2019s executive action on immigration by blocking the funding for it, plans for the small army of workers are moving forward. The action is part of a larger trend: From 2001 to 2012 \u2014 mostly after the Sept. 11 attacks \u2014 the government added about 180,000 federal employees, for a total of more than 4.3 million, according to the Office of Personnel Management.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAt the citizenship and immigration agency, officials said they had signed a $7.8 million lease in a gleaming new building, which they will occupy starting next month. During a recent speech in Los Angeles, the agency\u2019s director, Le\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez, said that 5,000 people had already applied for the Crystal City jobs.\n\nIn the bulletin that the agency sent out, dated Dec. 1, the word \u201cTODAY!\u201d is printed in red next to a dozen jobs with titles like special assistant, management program analyst and immigration services officer. By the time the new Republican Congress takes up the debate about funding for the president\u2019s immigration plan early next year, many of those new jobs are likely to be filled.\n\nSome Republicans who have noticed the preparations for the new center have issued statements of outrage, but so far they have done little else. Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama, called the new facility \u201ca clear symbol of the president\u2019s defiance of the American people, their laws and their Constitution.\u201d He said in a statement that the new hiring would \u201cfoist on the nation laws Congress has repeatedly refused to pass.\u201d\n\nMr. Rodr\u00edguez declined to be interviewed. But other administration officials readily say they are eager to put in place the infrastructure needed to allow undocumented people to apply for work permits by the early spring. That will require a new website, application forms and people to run background checks and process application fees that will probably be several hundred dollars.\n\nThe immigration agency officials said the fees would ultimately pay for lease and salary costs. But because the fees are not yet being collected, officials said the initial lease and salary payments would be made from other fees, which would be replenished when the new program was up and running.\n\nThe new center is, of course, a minor outpost compared with agencies that have grown rapidly in the past. When Congress and President George W. Bush agreed in 2002 to create the Department of Homeland Security, Mr. Bush said it would employ 170,000 people.\n\nDecades earlier, the creation of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965 and 1966 led to new functions of government and large increases in the bureaucracy.\n\nIn 2010, the passage of the Affordable Care Act led to a surge in hiring at the Internal Revenue Service, which asked for about 1,000 new workers to apply the tax credits and enforce other provisions.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very easy to focus on the benefits,\u201d said Michael R. Strain, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute. \u201cThose are usually the motivating impulse behind the action. But there are costs to it as well.\u201d\n\nMr. Strain said the intense debate about Mr. Obama\u2019s executive action on immigration had focused almost exclusively on questions about the limits of the president\u2019s constitutional authority to act without Congress. Little attention was paid to the impact on the size of the bureaucracy.\n\n\u201cOne thousand new workers springing up in Arlington, Va. \u2014 it\u2019s a nice example of the degree to which when the government does something big, it has a lot of consequences that people don\u2019t think of,\u201d he said. \u201cOur public debate and our political leaders need to do a better job of identifying those effects.\u201d\n\nOnce it opens next year, the operations center will become a part of the federal suburban sprawl that has helped define the Beltway bubble. But first, the facility could end up at the center of the tug of war between Mr. Obama and the Republican-controlled Congress.\n\n\u201cIt really goes to what is the extent of executive authority to make policy and then implement policy,\u201d Ms. Kamarck, of the Brookings Institution, said. \u201cThis is going to be the crux of the fight.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20141225144643, "twitter": {"description": "The Citizenship and Immigration Services agency will spend millions for a lease and 1,000 new employees to carry out President Obama\u2019s executive actions on immigration.", "title": "U.S. Agency Hiring 1,000 After Obama\u2019s Immigration Order", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/26/us/politics/little-noticed-in-immigration-overhaul-a-government-hiring-rush.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003335659"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "creator": "shearm", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/12/26/us/MEMO/MEMO-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/26/us/politics/little-noticed-in-immigration-overhaul-a-government-hiring-rush.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003335659", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/26/us/politics/little-noticed-in-immigration-overhaul-a-government-hiring-rush.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us/politics", "channels": "NytNow", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Dec. 25, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "Citizenship and Immigration Services (US)", "keywords": "Citizenship and Immigration Services (US),Immigration and Emigration,Obama  Barack,Arlington (Va),United States Politics and Government", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Michael D.
