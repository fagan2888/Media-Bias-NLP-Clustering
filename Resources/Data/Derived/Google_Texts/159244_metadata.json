The leaders of China, India, Russia, and Germany are all skipping the U.N. climate gathering. Since they are among the largest CO2 emitters, without their agreement, CO2 will continue to rise whatever America and the rest of the world does.\n\n\u201cThe thing is, they\u2019ve finally recognized the climate farce for what it is: a giant wealth transfer scheme from the poor in rich countries to the rich in poor countries.\n\n\u201cWhile Obama commits to squandering U.S. taxpayers\u2019 hard-earned money subsidizing green energy schemes in poor countries, the leaders of China, India, Russia, and Germany are concentrating on improving economic conditions in their own countries.\n\n\u201cUnable to get an ineffective, costly climate treaty through the Senate, Obama has evidently decided to burnish his environmental credentials and cement his green legacy with measures which sound good but will ultimately do nothing to prevent climate change and will inevitably harm our economy. I guess that will be the next president\u2019s problem to deal with.\u201d\n\nH. Sterling Burnett\n\nResearch Fellow, Environment & Energy Policy\n\nThe Heartland Institute\n\nManaging Editor, Environment & Climate News\n\nhburnett@heartland.org\n\n\u201cThis is nothing but the latest round of executive orders that will bypass Congress and probably violate the U.S. Constitution. Don\u2019t forget that in July 1997, the United States Senate voted unanimously against the very initiatives now proposed by President Obama. Those senators included current Obama cabinet members John Kerry and Chuck Hagel.\n\nS. Fred Singer\n\nSenior Fellow, Environment\n\nThe Heartland Institute\n\nDirector/Founder\n\nScience and Environmental Policy Project\n\nsepp@his.com\n\n\u201cPresident Obama\u2019s climate agenda will succeed in sending our nation into poverty. Many of his programs promote needless spending of tax dollars on renewable energy sources of wind, solar, ethanol from corn, other biofuels, etc. that are not competitive with abundant, inexpensive, and geographically distributed coal, oil, and natural gas. For a nation going into debt about $1.5 billion per day, these intrusions into the marketplace cause debt to spiral out of control.\n\n\u201cThere is a vast amount of experimental data showing increased atmospheric carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels has a negligible effect on global warming or using President Obama\u2019s term \u2018climate change.\u2019 The most obvious at this time is the pause in global warming the past 17 years in which increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide is the highest in a millennia. Using unworkable computer models for global climate change policy shows a total lack of common sense.\u201d\n\nJames H. Rust\n\nProfessor of nuclear engineering (Ret.), Georgia Tech\n\nPolicy Advisor\n\nThe Heartland Institute\n\njrust@bellsouth.net\n\n\u201cThe critical scientific measure of whether or not increased atmospheric carbon dioxide will cause significant global warming is the sensitivity of the earth\u2019s temperatures to a doubling of carbon dioxide. Since 1979, the estimate has been 1.5 \u00baC to 4.5 \u00baC \u2014 about 3\u00ba to 8\u00baF. U.S. government reports estimate U.S. expenditures on climate change top $165 billion, with over $35 billion given to climate science between 1993 and 2013. Yet, the latest report (2013) by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change places the sensitivity at 1.5 \u00baC to 4.5 \u00baC, the same as it was 35 years ago.\n\n\u201cThe simple fact is that there has been no warming of the atmosphere for over a decade and no warming of the surface for over 15 years, which government-funded climate science cannot explain. The failure of the government to advance scientific knowledge provides a clear illustration of the problems in critical assumptions in the research, as well as how the research is being conducted. All the pomp of the UN and its activities cannot hide these deficiencies.\n\n\u201cFurther spending on climate change is unjustified until these deficiencies are directly addressed with a comprehensive understanding of the natural causes of global warming/climate change \u2014 a topic which is largely ignored or minimized by government-financed science.\u201d\n\nKenneth Haapala\n\nExecutive Vice President\n\nScience and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP)\n\nKen@Haapala.com\n\n\u201cPresident Obama\u2019s speech to the United Nations regarding climate change ignores the fact that humanity has nothing to do with the changes that occur in the Earth\u2019s climate and has never played a role in affecting or influencing those changes. They are part of massive and natural cycles from warmth to coolness and back again that have occurred over the course of billions of years. They are all related to the cycles of the Sun and are influenced by our atmosphere, our oceans, volcanic activity, and other factors far beyond anything humanity can alter. Moreover, they occur over periods that reflect centuries, such as the last mini-ice age that lasted from 1300 to 1850.\n\n\u201cTo suggest that the United Nations or any other global form of governance has anything to do with the climate is false. This is about depriving people of their freedom.\u201d\n\nAlan Caruba\n\nFounder, The National Anxiety Center\n\nPolicy Advisor, The Heartland Institute\n\nacaruba@aol.com\n\n\u201cObama only offers hypothetical solutions to imaginary climate change in a vague distant future as a distraction from the real and growing social, economic, political and military problems that have been left to fester under his administration.\u201d\n\nWalter Starck\n\nPolicy Advisor, Environment and Energy\n\nThe Heartland Institute\n\nmedia@heartland.org", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://blog.heartland.org/2014/09/heartland-institute-experts-comment-on-obamas-climate-speech-at-united-nations/", "type": "activity", "image": "http://blog.heartland.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Barack-Obama-United-Nations-Climate-Speech-2014.jpg", "site_name": "Somewhat Reasonable", "title": "Heartland Institute Experts Comment on Obama\u2019s Climate Speech at United Nations"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe6042\"", "article_summary": "The following statements from environment policy experts at The Heartland Institute \u2013 a free-market think tank \u2013 may be used for attribution.\nUsing unworkable computer models for global climate change policy shows a total lack of common sense.\u201dJames H.
