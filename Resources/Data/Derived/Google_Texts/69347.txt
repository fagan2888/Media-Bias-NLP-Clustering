ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — New York’s health exchange says it is extending the Feb. 15 application deadline for another two weeks for those who have begun the process.

Health officials say those individuals will have until Feb. 28 to finish their application and enroll in a commercial or nonprofit insurer’s health plan in the system.

They would have coverage starting April 1.

In the first year of the exchange, New York enrolled 370,604 people with commercial and nonprofit insurers.

Another 525,283 enrolled in Medicaid and 64,875 in the state’s Child Health Plus coverage.

Enrollment in those government-funded programs continues all year.
