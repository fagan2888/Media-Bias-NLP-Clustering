She\u2019s come out against the Keystone XL pipeline. She endorsed repealing the Cadillac tax on high-cost health insurance plans. She put together a comprehensive Wall Street reform package that in many ways, though not all, hews closely to others in the field.\n\nOn Wednesday, Clinton decided to oppose the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the just-inked trade deal with 12 nations that is a centerpiece of Obama administration second-term achievements. \u201cThe bar here is very high and, based on what I have seen, I don't believe this agreement has met it,\u201d Clinton said in a statement, cruelly timed to the moment that top White House officials were holding a conference call defending the deal.\n\nRelated: Clinton\u2019s Big Switch from \u2018Moderate\u2019 to Liberal Activist\n\nThis has sent a chill into the hearts of a particular Washington specimen: the self-appointed guardians of order. Mark Halperin flatly accused Clinton of lying about her opposition to TPP. Others pointed to Clinton\u2019s praise for TPP in her recent book, or the 45 times she\u2019s spoken out in favor of it. And Ezra Klein pronounced himself \u201cunnerved\u201d because it shows her as calculating and poll-driven.\n\nIn other words, the theory goes, Clinton is pandering, taking a position that she may not sincerely support to appease a faction of the constituency she wants in her corner. Unions don\u2019t like TPP or the Cadillac tax, and with Bernie Sanders breathing down her neck, Clinton had to adjust her profile to keep their endorsements rolling in.\n\nThere are definitely signs that Clinton had prior (and very possibly, future) support for TPP. Her top policy advisor on the deal while at the State Department, Robert Hormats, praised it the day before she came out against it. If you take the temperature of those in her policy orbit, you would probably find more supporters than opponents.\n\nRelated: Clinton Plays Her Hand Deftly on the TPP Trade Deal\n\nBut a lot has changed since November 2012, when Clinton called TPP \u201cthe gold standard in trade agreements.\u201d One point she made in this week\u2019s PBS interview on the topic is that, while at the State Department, she pushed for higher standards in the South Korean free trade agreement, yet was still disappointed in the results. \u201cEven a strong deal can fall short on delivering the promised benefits,\u201d Clinton said in her statement.\n\nIndeed, the U.S.-Korea deal led to an 80 percent increase in the bilateral trade deficit and 75,000 U.S. jobs, according to the liberal Economic Policy Institute. So a retrospective view, combined with witnessing first-hand the struggles of the American worker on the campaign trail, may have brought Clinton to a considered change in viewpoint.\n\nBut the bigger issue is this: What\u2019s wrong with pandering? Our system of government, as it has evolved, offers precious few opportunities for ordinary people to get into the national conversation. Big Money has a tight grip on governance through insistent lobbying, and for the most part they fund national elections.\n\nFor once, the Democratic nominating fight, and the emergence of Bernie Sanders, has given public interest groups a voice, a rare channel to impact the political system. We shouldn\u2019t roll our eyes at that; we should respect it. National leaders should have to listen to their constituents and earn their support. Primaries are one of the only moments that allow such an opportunity.\n\nRelated: Clinton Throws Down a Challenge to Obama on Guns\n\nThe thing about outside leverage on politics is that it\u2019s not static. It can change, and leaders can drop their panders when it suits them politically. Public interest groups and ordinary citizens must not take anything for granted and remain insistent. They are correct to look at this skeptically.\n\nBut here\u2019s what we know from political science, a point made most eloquently by the same Ezra Klein who is so unnerved by Clinton\u2019s position-taking: Politicians typically keep their campaign promises. Presidents may not fulfill them, but that has more to do with Congressional obstruction than a flip-flop.\n\nIn other words, locking in a particular endorsement in a primary has real lingering effects. That makes the process some call pandering, which I would call paying attention to your political base, all the more important. If you can move a candidate on an issue you care about, you can keep them in that position for a long time.\n\nThis isn\u2019t always the case, and if Clinton won the election, went into office and subsequently started whipping votes for the same trade deal she now decries, I wouldn\u2019t exactly be surprised. But the point is that that would be an unusual circumstance.\n\nRelated: Hillary Clinton Is Right \u2014 The Obamacare \u2018Cadillac Tax\u2019 Is a Lemon\n\nEven if it transpired, Clinton\u2019s opposition today has real meaning. TPP will get a vote within the next six months, and with so many problems on the left and right, I\u2019d doubt it would pass in the House if the vote were held today. The Clinton announcement only strengthens that likelihood, and January 2017, when the next president is sworn in, is a long way away. The whole agreement could collapse by then. Opposition now holds incredible value for the coalition against TPP, even with the potential of support later.\n\nMore important, opposition allows the popular will to be spread through politicians who may not even share opponents\u2019 goals. While one poll shows amorphous support for \u201cexpanding trade deals,\u201d others clearly display broad opposition to the types of policies embedded in TPP. Clinton cannot simultaneously be obsessively poll-driven and oppose TPP against her personal interest. Presumably she knows at least something about where the electorate sits on this issue. In a Washington wired for a pro-trade consensus, that perspective usually doesn\u2019t get expressed \u2014 unless there\u2019s an election, and a politician fighting for votes and willing to express it.\n\nWashington types love politicians who make \u201ctough choices\u201d against the public\u2019s wishes. And they don\u2019t like pandering. Another way to put this is that they don\u2019t like the unwashed masses getting their noses involved in the choices our government makes. I would rather that regular citizens take advantage of the leverage afforded in opportune moments to obtain the power not already sucked up by the wealthy and large corporations. We shouldn\u2019t react cynically, but happily, that there\u2019s still a role in our allegedly broken system for the voice of the common man.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Hillary Clinton, in preparation for next week\u2019s initial Democratic pre", "title": "In Praise of Hillary Clinton\u2019s Shameless Pandering", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2015/10/09/Praise-Hillary-Clinton-s-Shameless-Pandering", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/06232015_Hillary_Clinton.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2015/10/09/Praise-Hillary-Clinton-s-Shameless-Pandering", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/06232015_Hillary_Clinton.jpg", "creator": "@ddayen", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Hillary Clinton, in preparation for next week\u2019s initial Democratic pre", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Related: Hillary Clinton Is Right \u2014 The Obamacare \u2018Cadillac Tax\u2019 Is a LemonEven if it transpired, Clinton\u2019s opposition today has real meaning.\nOthers pointed to Clinton\u2019s praise for TPP in her recent book, or the 45 times she\u2019s spoken out in favor of it.\nOn Wednesday, Clinton decided to oppose the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the just-inked trade deal with 12 nations that is a centerpiece of Obama administration second-term achievements.\nHillary Clinton, in preparation for next week\u2019s initial Democratic presidential debate, is giving her rivals little room to differentiate themselves.\nThat makes the process some call pandering, which I would call paying attention to your political base, all the more important."}
