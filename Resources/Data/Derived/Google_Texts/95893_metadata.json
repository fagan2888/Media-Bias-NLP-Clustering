Today, at the age of 22, Charles is constantly told that her love for limbo could lead to some pretty serious health issues. She even sees a chiropractor once a week to have her hips realigned, since her performances put a debilitating strain on her back.\n\nDespite growing concern for her health, Charles recently took her talents to the extreme, after she contorted her body and shimmied under an SUV. Although even Charles has been unable to break her impressive limbo world record of 8-and-a-half inches, she decided to reach a new low, so to speak, by shimmying underneath a car \u2014 around 9 inches, with certain spots being lower than others.\n\nCharles\u2019 chiropractor, Dr. John Przybylak, says that while most people would suffer serious injuries to their hips and back if they attempted the same flexible stunts, Charles is only able to do so thanks to her six hours of rigorous training a day. Her mother, Sherrie, also had an extensive career in limboing that lasted 16 years, but ended up retiring due to injury.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "watch, limbo, queen, shemika, charles, shimmy, under, car, set, worlds, first, record, attempt", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Watch the limbo queen and Guiness World Record holder, Shemika Charles, shimmy under an SUV.", "title": "Limbo Queen Gets Very Low To Shimmy Under A Car [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/watch-limbo-queen-shemika-charles-shimmy-under-car-set-worlds-first-record-attempt-338290", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/06/15/watch-limbo-queen-shemika-charles-shimmy-under-car-set-worlds-first-record-attempt.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Watch the limbo queen and Guiness World Record holder, Shemika Charles, shimmy under an SUV.", "title": "Limbo Queen Gets Very Low To Shimmy Under A Car [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/watch-limbo-queen-shemika-charles-shimmy-under-car-set-worlds-first-record-attempt-338290", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/06/15/watch-limbo-queen-shemika-charles-shimmy-under-car-set-worlds-first-record-attempt.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/06/15/watch-limbo-queen-shemika-charles-shimmy-under-car-set-worlds-first-record-attempt.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Weird Medicine", "published_time": "2015-06-15T14:50:25-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-15T15:26:35-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Watch the limbo queen and Guiness World Record holder, Shemika Charles, shimmy under an SUV."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1060\"", "article_summary": "Despite growing concern for her health, Charles recently took her talents to the extreme, after she contorted her body and shimmied under an SUV.\nBack in 2010, Shemika Charles set a world record after she limboed under 8-and-a-half inches \u2014 the height of a beer bottle \u2014 and she wasn\u2019t even 18 years old at the time.\nToday, at the age of 22, Charles is constantly told that her love for limbo could lead to some pretty serious health issues.\nAlthough even Charles has been unable to break her impressive limbo world record of 8-and-a-half inches, she decided to reach a new low, so to speak, by shimmying underneath a car \u2014 around 9 inches, with certain spots being lower than others.\nHer mother, Sherrie, also had an extensive career in limboing that lasted 16 years, but ended up retiring due to injury."}
