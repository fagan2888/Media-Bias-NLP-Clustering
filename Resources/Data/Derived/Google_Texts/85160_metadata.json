United Parcel Service Inc. dropped coverage for employed spouses and Home Depot Inc. sent 20,000 part-time workers to government-sponsored insurance websites.\n\n\u201cEmployers with a lot of part-time workers and low-wage employees are going to bump against the coverage requirements for anyone working 30 or more hours,\u201d Beth Umland, Mercer\u2019s director of research for health and benefits, said in a telephone interview. \u201cEmployers who already offered generous packages, who don\u2019t have a lot of part-timers, are worried about the excise tax.\u201d\n\nCadillac Tax\n\nThe excise tax, known as the \u201cCadillac\u201d tax, is a provision of the Affordable Care Act aimed at businesses with generous health benefits. Employers with coverage exceeding $10,200 for individuals and $27,500 for families will be taxed 40 percent starting in 2018, on the theory that the plans boost medical costs.\n\nAbout 62 percent of employers surveyed had concerns related to the so-called Cadillac tax. According to Mercer, 42 percent of employers would be subject to the tax in 2018 if they made no changes to their current plans.\n\nEmployers aren\u2019t waiting to make changes, the survey found. Almost one in five employers have already dropped the plans and another 33 percent are considering dropping the coverage. Employers are turning instead to private exchanges, or consumer-directed health plans, which give employees personal health-care accounts.\n\nAbout 8 percent of employers have, like UPS, dropped coverage for spouses who have other coverage available, and another 11 percent are considering doing so for 2015, the survey said.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Caroline Chen", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-03-12/employers-raise-u-s-worker-deductibles-to-reduce-health-costs", "title": "Employers Raise U.S. Worker Deductibles to Cut Health Costs", "description": "Four of five U.S. companies have raised deductibles or are considering doing so as health costs increase, according to a survey of more than 700 employers.", "card": "summary", "site": "@business"}, "parsely-author": "Caroline Chen", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "Mercer LLC,Health", "news_keywords": "Mercer LLC,Health", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-03-12/employers-raise-u-s-worker-deductibles-to-reduce-health-costs", "parsely-title": "Employers Raise U.S. Worker Deductibles to Cut Health Costs", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-03-12T18:54:16.696Z", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "Four of five U.S. companies have raised deductibles or are considering doing so as health costs increase, according to a survey of more than 700 employers.", "parsely-tags": "Mercer LLC,Health,Region: Global,Page: article", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.bwbx.io/business/public/images/favicons/mstile-144x144-bbd2101292.png", "date": "2014-03-12T18:54:16.696Z", "parsely-section": "science-energy", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "og": {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-03-12/employers-raise-u-s-worker-deductibles-to-reduce-health-costs", "type": "website", "site_name": "Bloomberg.com", "description": "Four of five U.S. companies have raised deductibles or are considering doing so as health costs increase, according to a survey of more than 700 employers.", "title": "Employers Raise U.S. Worker Deductibles to Cut Health Costs"}, "fb": {"status": "Four of five U.S. companies have raised deductibles or are considering doing so as health costs increase, according to a survey of more than 700 employers."}, "parsely-post-id": "N2BRU86JTSEX01", "format-detection": "telephone=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd024f\"", "article_summary": "Employers are turning instead to private exchanges, or consumer-directed health plans, which give employees personal health-care accounts.\nFour of five U.S. companies have raised deductibles or are considering doing so as health costs increase, according to a survey of more than 700 employers.\nUnited Parcel Service Inc. dropped coverage for employed spouses and Home Depot Inc. sent 20,000 part-time workers to government-sponsored insurance websites.\nAlmost one in five employers have already dropped the plans and another 33 percent are considering dropping the coverage.\nAbout 8 percent of employers have, like UPS, dropped coverage for spouses who have other coverage available, and another 11 percent are considering doing so for 2015, the survey said."}
