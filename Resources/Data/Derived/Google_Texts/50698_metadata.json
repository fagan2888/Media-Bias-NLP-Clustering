They\u2019ve been around as a minimum standard in other industries, but they\u2019re very exciting when you apply them to the healthcare space. As providers and patients become more comfortable using these technologies in this concept, it\u2019s all about the mentality and a shift that needs to occur there and I think we\u2019ll see more and more alignment and people getting on board and believing in these new methods and approaches.\u201d\n\nMoore explained that the transition away from the traditional provider culture may be connected to the move away from fee for service care and on to value-based care model.\n\n\u201cWhen you change the payment structure, it\u2019s not about volume, it\u2019s not about how many visits did I see today in the office,\u201d Moore said. \u201cThen you can really focus on: What does it take to engage patients in improving their health? How do you put the right team around them to support them?\u2026 We are at the beginning of a revolution in this area. Most practices out there are still operating in a fee for service environment, doing the best they can to provide the best service that they can to their patients, but this is an incredible opportunity right now.\u201d\n\nHe adds that another reason for the change is that patients may start speaking out about what kind of care they want.\n\n\"A patient will say 'I\u2019m not going to go to the doctor\u2019s office anymore because they don\u2019t provide me with this kind of service or this kind of experience' and that\u2019s what is really going to change the game,\" Moore said. \"I think what we\u2019re all talking about here is about to happen, finally in this industry. Because of transparency in pricing, because of the Affordable Care Act, because of all of these things people are going to be making decisions, it\u2019s going to make this battleship turn a lot faster.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "athenahealth Director of Corporate Strategy Emily Tyson", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "MobiHealthNews", "description": "athenahealth Director of Corporate Strategy Emily Tyson", "title": "Execs point to healthcare billing, culture shift as biggest factors for change", "url": "http://mobihealthnews.com/38729/execs-point-to-healthcare-billing-culture-shift-as-biggest-factors-for-change", "image": "http://mobihealthnews.com/sites/default/files/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Emily-Tyson-athenahealth.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-12-03T16:12:53+00:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://mobihealthnews.com/38729/execs-point-to-healthcare-billing-culture-shift-as-biggest-factors-for-change", "image": {"src": "http://mobihealthnews.com/sites/default/files/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Emily-Tyson-athenahealth.jpg"}, "description": "athenahealth Director of Corporate Strategy Emily Tyson", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Execs point to healthcare billing, culture shift as biggest factors for change"}, "keywords": "digital health news, mobile health news, health apps, medical apps, fitness apps", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-03T16:12:53+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-03T16:12:53+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbfcf\"", "article_summary": "Twine Health CEO and Cofounder John Moore and athenahealth Director of Corporate Strategy Emily Tyson discussed how these recent changes have spurred larger shifts in the healthcare system.\nThey\u2019ve been around as a minimum standard in other industries, but they\u2019re very exciting when you apply them to the healthcare space.\n\u201cThen you can really focus on: What does it take to engage patients in improving their health?\n\u201cWhen you change the payment structure, it\u2019s not about volume, it\u2019s not about how many visits did I see today in the office,\u201d Moore said.\n\"I think what we\u2019re all talking about here is about to happen, finally in this industry."}
