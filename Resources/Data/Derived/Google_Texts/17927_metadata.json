Schumer made a surprising confession about the Affordable Care Act. We also look at the potential political costs of the civil unrest that has spread from Ferguson, Mo., to both coasts. Plus, favorite political recipes for Thanksgiving Day.\n\nWith the National Guard still out in force in Ferguson, Mo., and protesters in the streets nationwide, political figures and analysts say the police shooting of Michael Brown, the grand jury\u2019s decision not to indict the police officer who shot and killed him, and the ensuing violence will have significant political repercussions both at the national level and in Missouri.\n\n\u201cI think it is something that is going to be part of the conversation going into 2016,\u201d said Peverill Squire, a political science professor at the University of Missouri. \u201cQuestions are going to continue to linger, and I don\u2019t think candidates in either party will be able to escape questions about it.\u201d\n\nIn calling for calm, lawmakers have urged frustrated members of the public to take out their anger at the ballot box rather than through violence. Members of the Congressional Black Caucus plan a series of special floor speeches about Mr. Brown\u2019s killing when they return to Washington on Monday.\n\nIn a Time magazine essay, Senator Rand Paul, the Kentucky Republican, said, \u201cI mostly blame politicians\u201d for the crisis in Ferguson. \u201cSomething is wrong with criminal justice in America,\u201d he said.\n\nBefore Ferguson erupted in violence, Gov. Jay Nixon of Missouri was seen as a centrist Democrat with a possible national future, but his heavily criticized response to events there has ended any such speculation. At the same time, Claire McCaskill\u2018s high-profile role in urging a less militarized police presence will only add to a growing sense that the Democratic senator intends to run for governor of Missouri in two years.\n\n\u2014 Carl Hulse\n\nA brewing battle between the Republican senators Michael B. Enzi of Wyoming and Jeff Sessions of Alabama for the chairmanship of the Budget Committee will end up shaping the tenor and substance of the fiscal fights over the last two years of the Obama presidency.\n\nSince the Republican midterm sweep, Washington has expected Mr. Sessions, a hard-charging conservative, to move from ranking Republican to committee chairman, aligning the leadership of the Senate panel with that of the House Budget Committee, where Representative Tom Price of Georgia has been elected chairman.\n\nSurprising virtually everyone, Mr. Enzi has declared, \u201cNot so fast.\u201d He has made it clear that because he has more seniority than Mr. Sessions, the chairmanship should be his for the taking.\n\n\u201cIt is Senator Sessions that is challenging him, not the other way around,\u201d Mr. Enzi\u2019s spokesman, Dan Head, said. \u201cSenator Sessions is currently the ranking member because Senator Enzi did not exert his seniority two years ago.\u201d\n\nThe low-key Mr. Enzi is conservative, but as a member of the Senate Finance Committee and a former member of the \u201cGang of Six\u201d that tried to reach bipartisan accord on a near-universal health insurance bill in 2009, he has far more experience working with Democrats than Mr. Sessions.\n\nConservatives are already rallying around Mr. Sessions. But in the Senate, seniority almost always triumphs.\n\n\u2014 Jonathan Weisman\n\nWhen Republicans renew their efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act in 2015, it is likely that they will cite a prominent new critic of the health care law \u2014 Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, the chamber\u2019s No. 3 Democrat and his party\u2019s messaging maestro.\n\nMr. Schumer, in a speech at the National Press Club, confessed on Tuesday that he believes Democrats made a mistake in pushing for the Affordable Care Act in 2009 and 2010 when they should have focused on middle-class money concerns.\n\nIt is pretty easy to imagine how that will play on the Republican side of the Senate floor: \u201cEven my good friend Senator Schumer, a respected Democratic strategist, says the law was a mistake.\u201d\n\nMr. Schumer told reporters he was not worried about becoming the Democratic face of opposition to the health law. Republicans, he said, don\u2019t \u201cneed anything else to play into their repeal efforts.\u201d\n\nHe also noted that Republicans seemed to step back from their repeal push during the midterm campaigns and that \u201cthey moved on to other issues by and large.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Carl Hulse\n\nGuessing games are among Washington\u2019s favorite pastimes, and this week\u2019s resignation of Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel has players off and running.\n\nIt\u2019s even more fun when the front-runners refuse to participate. And with Mich\u00e8le A. Flournoy and Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island saying this week that they aren\u2019t interested, it\u2019s a wide-open field.\n\nJeh Johnson, the secretary of Homeland Security, has been mentioned, as has Denis R. McDonough, the current White House chief of staff. Those names are to be expected. They\u2019re both high-ranking administration officials with strong national security credentials. (Mr. Johnson is a former Pentagon lawyer, and Mr. McDonough was a deputy national security adviser.)\n\nBut former Senator Joseph I. Lieberman? His name was floated this week by Senator Ted Cruz, the Texas Republican, as a strong option from \u201cthe president\u2019s own party.\u201d\n\nBut as Talking Points Memo points out, Mr. Lieberman \u201cbecame an independent in 2006 after his alienation from the party amid his steadfast support of the Iraq war.\u201d\n\nOur own Helene Cooper reports that Louis R. Ch\u00eanevert\u2019s name was batted around on Monday when he left United Technologies Corporation, where he was chief executive.\n\nOne problem: He\u2019s Canadian.\n\n\u2014 Steve Kenny\n\nPresident Obama pardons a Thanksgiving turkey. Yes, again.\n\nThe Labor Department releases weekly jobless claims, the Commerce Department releases new home sales for October and Freddie Mac releases the weekly mortgage rates.\n\nThe winter storm that threatens to lock down the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic for Thanksgiving. Check your planes, trains and automobiles before leaving home.\n\nThanksgiving\u2019s on Thursday, and you\u2019re invited to share it with someone who is nearly as addicted to political prognostication as you are and you don\u2019t know what to bring as a gift. How about one of these First Draft-approved recipes, culled from decades of New York Times political coverage?\n\nTry the White House apple cake. Consider Laura Bush\u2019s corn bread dressing. Or Nancy Reagan\u2019s monkey bread. (We\u2019ll pass, this holiday season, on Ann Romney\u2019s meatloaf cakes.)\n\nAnd if you\u2019re in charge of the centerpiece dish, we have a look at the brine recipe Speaker John A. Boehner has come up with for his turkey, which deploys two cups of (presumably Ohio-tapped) maple syrup in addition to salt, garlic and a lot of bay leaves. Set that up tonight, roast in the morning and follow the speaker\u2019s lead in pulling the bird when it reaches an internal temperature of 160 degrees Fahrenheit. That number will rise as the bird rests, leaving you time to check the latest political news before dinner.\n\nFor other ideas, you can visit our Thanksgiving page for nonpartisan help on your turkey, dressing, side dishes, gravy and pies.\n\n\u2014 Sam Sifton\n\nThe key witness in the grand jury\u2019s Ferguson decision was the officer who fired the fatal shots.\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s immigration action has infused the Tea Party with new energy.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency plans to introduce its long-delayed ozone regulations.\n\nThe Americans held hostage in Iran watch with dismay as the nuclear talks with Tehran go on and on.\n\nThe arguments over each state\u2019s Thanksgiving recipe favorites are not close to being over.\n\nGeorge Stephanopoulos of ABC News interviews Darren Wilson, the Ferguson, Mo., police officer who killed Michael Brown.\n\nPresident Obama isn\u2019t the first American leader to be called an \u201cunaccountable monarch.\u201d Politico Magazine says it\u2019s the oldest insult in American politics.\n\nThe Christian Science Monitor discusses speculation that President Obama will move unilaterally to improve relations with Cuba.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration\u2019s new calorie-counting rules will be of no help in reducing Americans\u2019 waistlines, The New Republic says.\n\nBon Appetit shows just what Julia Child could do with a Thanksgiving turkey.\n\nWith that, First Draft wishes you a Happy Thanksgiving.
