(Photo: Rick Bowmer / AP) Story Highlights Armed militia's takeover highlights American abuses of treaties with Indian nations.\n\n\u201cWe were here first\u201d said Charlotte Rodrique, chairwoman of the Burns Paiute Indian Tribe, whose ancestors lived on what is now the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, now occupied by a white militia group.\n\nThis incident points up, among a host of other issues, the need for the enforcement of treaties with American Indian nations by the federal government: the 371 treaties that have been flagrantly broken by the same government.\n\nIn fact, touch the surface of any land issue in the United States from Florida to New York, from the Carolina coast to California and at all points in between, and strong and legitimate claims by Indian nations shall arise.\n\nIn Tennessee, in the wake of the occupation, state Rep. Andy Holt, R-Dresden, tweeted \u2013 \u201c#bundy militia Where can I send support for your effort?\"\n\nObviously, Holt knows neither the history of the area nor American Indian treaty law.\n\nIf he did, he would realize that if anyone needs support, it is the Burns Paiute Indian Tribe in their efforts to have the land, their ancestral home, returned to them, the rightful owners.\n\nTo begin with, all of the U.S. is ancestral native land fraudulently taken from its rightful owners in the biggest land grab in world history. All of this country is Indian land.\n\nThe U.S. still legally belongs to native people. As one Paiute tribal member recently stated: \u201cAll lands have been stolen from the Indian tribes.\u201d\n\nAlbert Bender of Nashville is a Cherokee, activist, journalist and author of the recently published \"Native American Wisdom.\" Email him at column-albertbender07@yahoo.com. (Photo: Submitted)\n\nThe Refuge is comprised of 187,000 acres and was the 19th century Malheur Indian Reservation.\n\nThis was by the Treaty of 1868. But white settlers began encroaching on the reservation as soon as it was established.\n\nPresident Ulysses S. Grant, under heavy pressure from land-hungry, Indian-hating settlers, began opening areas of the reservation for settlement, reducing native land.\n\nConflict increased between Indians and whites leading to the Bannock War of 1878.\n\nIn January 1879, the Paiutes were forcibly removed by the U.S. Army from the reservation in knee-deep snow, many in shackles, on their own \u201cTrail of Tears,\u201d 350 miles north to present-day Washington state.\n\nIn October 1879, the Malheur Reservation was \u201cdiscontinued,\u201d and ranchers and settlers took possession of the land.\n\nPresently, the Burns Paiute Indian Tribe live on an allotment of 760 acres, a few miles northwest of the city of Burns, Ore.\n\nThis is a draconian cutback of the original Malheur Indian Reservation of 1.5 million acres.\n\nBut in the meantime, the occupiers who \u201cwant their land back,\" if not the direct descendants of the land pirates responsible for the illegal dispossession of the Paiute people, are the ideological progeny of the same avaricious invaders.\n\nThe occupation brings up another point. The whole world is watching the disparity in law enforcement as it relates to Indian and white. This brings to mind Wounded Knee and the government reaction to occupation by native people.\n\nThe Burns Paiute Tribe has set as its priority the return of the refuge to reservation status or at the very least maintaining the land as a wildlife refuge that will protect its natural and cultural integrity.\n\nThere are still Indian cultural sites on the refuge, and the Paiute people still engage in food gathering in the area.\n\nTribal members traverse the refuge to gather plants for traditional crafts and native medicine.\n\nCultural items that have been found, thousands of years old, give mute testimony to Indian life on the land since time immemorial.\n\nNative land claims exist all over the country. There is even a story still abounding that insurance companies in parts of East Tennessee are reluctant to provide certain types of coverage for fear of the resurgence of Cherokee claims arising from fraudulent land-taking in the 18th and 19th centuries.\n\nSpeaking locally, the city of Nashville sits on land fraudulently taken from the Cherokee Nation during that same time period. I wonder if Rep. Holt realizes he is a tenant on Indian land.\n\nAs for the Malheur Wildlife Refuge, it should be returned, posthaste, to the Paiute people, the rightful owners.\n\nAlbert Bender of Nashville is a Cherokee, activist, journalist and author of the recently published \"Native American Wisdom.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://tnne.ws/1Rwagg6", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Armed militia's takeover highlights American abuses of treaties with Indian nations.", "og": {"site_name": "The Tennessean", "description": "Armed militia's takeover highlights American abuses of treaties with Indian nations.", "title": "Occupied Oregon land still belongs to Paiute Tribe", "url": "http://www.tennessean.com/story/opinion/contributors/2016/01/18/occupied-oregon-land-still-belongs-paiute-tribe/78867096/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/tennessean.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Armed militia's takeover highlights American abuses of treaties with Indian nations.", "title": "Occupied Oregon land still belongs to Paiute Tribe", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/16f70074208490b1b0d54c6be801b309fe4e568a/c=67-0-468-401&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/01/15/Nashville/Nashville/635884753669913729-Oregon-Ranchers.jpg", "creator": "@tennessean", "site": "@tennessean", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600028886", "fb": {"app_id": 121487414583460}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Subjects/Burns", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Subjects/Burns", "title": "Occupied Oregon land still belongs to Paiute Tribe", "author": "Albert Bender", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion/contributors", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1567c81b125406b84ca821f38c41db5ae3676168/c=117-0-418-401/local/-/media/2016/01/15/Nashville/Nashville/635884753669913729-Oregon-Ranchers.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/fc0937862a217af33f2702dadc63da97a8732b1a/c=67-0-468-401/local/-/media/2016/01/15/Nashville/Nashville/635884753669913729-Oregon-Ranchers.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9902e24b3ce22452871a78d74d7f00970fb66eca/c=0-0-533-401/local/-/media/2016/01/15/Nashville/Nashville/635884753669913729-Oregon-Ranchers.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4b9ede3820a54fc558b9aa527e18601b331caee4/c=0-50-534-352&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2016/01/15/Nashville/Nashville/635884753669913729-Oregon-Ranchers.jpg", "publishtime": "2016-01-18T10:00:42.840000-06:00", "shorthed": "Occupied Oregon land belongs to Paiutes", "articleid": 78867096, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e1d78d18d18c0e71d5c7c4a0350b598687f50fe1/c=0-50-534-352/local/-/media/2016/01/15/Nashville/Nashville/635884753669913729-Oregon-Ranchers.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/12e8db1cf3ffa498f089d5fa0fd628dc1c2b4ebe/c=155-0-380-401/local/-/media/2016/01/15/Nashville/Nashville/635884753669913729-Oregon-Ranchers.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, Burns Paiute Indian Tribe, Andy Holt, Oregon armed militia, American Indian tribes"}, "article_summary": "Presently, the Burns Paiute Indian Tribe live on an allotment of 760 acres, a few miles northwest of the city of Burns, Ore.\nTo begin with, all of the U.S. is ancestral native land fraudulently taken from its rightful owners in the biggest land grab in world history.\nAs for the Malheur Wildlife Refuge, it should be returned, posthaste, to the Paiute people, the rightful owners.\nIf he did, he would realize that if anyone needs support, it is the Burns Paiute Indian Tribe in their efforts to have the land, their ancestral home, returned to them, the rightful owners.\nI wonder if Rep.
