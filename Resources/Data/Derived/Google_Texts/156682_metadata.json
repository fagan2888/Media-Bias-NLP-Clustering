The staff has gone from the equivalent of 24.6 full-time jobs down to 19.8.\n\nHege said after the meeting that he saw the health district as \u201ca system in transition.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s what a lot of this is about,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act insured millions of new people, and was designed to shift clientele away from public health services and to medical clinics for their care, according to Hege.\n\nAs fewer people use public health services, the funding for it \u2014 which is in part based on billable services like any doctor\u2019s office \u2014 will decrease.\n\n\u201cThe whole reason our fees are dropping is people aren\u2019t coming here. They\u2019re going to their primary care doctor,\u201d Hege said.\n\nHe said it would be a challenge, and the goal was to minimize the challenge.\n\nWhile the county commission voted a year ago to leave the health district, it rescinded that vote.\n\nHege said his goal is to stay with the regional health district. He has recently proposed a new board makeup, which would just be county commissioners from the three counties in the district.\n\nNow, each county has one commissioner and two citizen representatives.\n\nHege said, \u201cThat would be helpful in us having a better voice in the district and having more confidence.\u201d\n\nHe feels it would lead to better communications and \u201chopefully a better outcome.\u201d\n\nBut health board chair Mike Smith, a Sherman County commissioner, didn\u2019t favor that, saying, \u201cMy belief is that we should have more public involvement, not less.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msvalidate.01": "6F0F769B18C1F1E5145E5D36120FA2DD", "google-site-verification": "dr1NYOQ7L4IbMMoa9sXvO5M_zmQUi6VBoRGJSuF4BSg", "og": {"url": "http://www.thedalleschronicle.com/news/2016/jan/26/public-health-waits-cash/", "type": "article", "title": "Public health waits for cash"}, "viewport": "width=1020", "description": "The North Central Public Health District, increasingly short staffed since a budget cut last summer and other staff departures, may get a cash infusion from a regional health organization Wednesday.\r\nThe Columbia Gorge Health Council, which governs state-funded health care for low income residents, got a sizeable \u201cbonus\u201d for meeting certain health goals set up by the state."}, "article_summary": "The Columbia Gorge Health Council, which governs state-funded health care for low income residents, got a sizeable \u201cbonus\u201d for meeting certain health goals set up by the state.\nThe North Central Public Health District, increasingly short staffed since a budget cut last summer and other staff departures, may get a cash infusion from a regional health organization Wednesday.\nAs fewer people use public health services, the funding for it \u2014 which is in part based on billable services like any doctor\u2019s office \u2014 will decrease.\n27 on a proposal from its clinical advisory panel to split about $165,000 in bonus money between the Hood River County Health Department and the health district that serves Wasco, Sherman and Gilliam counties.\nThe Affordable Care Act insured millions of new people, and was designed to shift clientele away from public health services and to medical clinics for their care, according to Hege."}
