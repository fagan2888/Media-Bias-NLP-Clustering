Michelle Obama is now quoting a Christian proverb – and a rather interesting one at that – to hail Obamacare to the liberal masses – no pun intended.

The Washington Examiner reported that Obama attended a fundraiser for Senate Democrats in New York, and “opened with a long defense of Obamacare, suggesting her audience lives by the principle that everyone should have insurance.”

According to the Examiner:

“We don’t believe in handouts. We don’t think anyone should get a free ride,” she said Monday afternoon in a speech at the Sheraton Hotel and Towers. “But we also understand one simple principle — that there but for the grace of God go I; that in the blink of an eye, any of us — any of us — could be faced with a terrible diagnosis. Any of us could be injured in a horrible accident. Any of us could lose the job we count on to support our family — any of us,” she said. “And when that happens, it shouldn’t mean falling off a cliff. It shouldn’t mean having to go without food, or medicine, or a roof over our heads — not here in the United States of America. Not in the greatest country on the planet. That is not who we are,” Obama added.

Interesting choice of proverbs she used to tout Obamacare: “There but for the grace of God, goes John Bradford” is attributed to the 16th century imprisoned English Reformer who allegedly made the statement as he watched prisoners being led to their executions from his Tower of London prison cell.

Bradford was ultimately burned at the stake for being a heretic.
