Andrew Cuomo\u2019s NY SAFE Act gun control law is a state secret.\n\nAlmost a year after the Secure Ammunition and Firearms Enforcement Act was passed by lawmakers and signed by the governor, state officials say they aren\u2019t required to reveal how many people have registered assault weapons with the state.\n\nThe law appears to have been written with such secrecy in mind \u2014 but it\u2019s become apparent only as requests for that information are being denied.\n\nThe law bans owning and selling assault-style weapons. Those who already owned such guns before the measure was signed can keep them if they register with the State Police by April 15, 2014.\n\nThe Times Union recently asked how many assault-weapon owners have registered their weapons to date.\n\nThe answer came in the form of a little-known clause tucked into the law that says the information is confidential: \u201cState Police cannot release information related to the registration of assault weapons including the number of assault weapons registered.\u201d\n\n\u201cThose records you seek are derived from information collected for the State Police database and are, therefore, exempt from disclosure,\u201d State Police spokeswoman Darcy Wells said in a written statement.\n\nThe State Police are charged with creating and maintaining a database of the registered guns.\n\nCuomo spokesman Richard Azzopardi referred questions to the State Police.\n\nOfficials pointed to a section in the SAFE Act that says, \u201cRecords assembled or collected for purposes of inclusion in such (a) database shall not be subject to disclosure.\u201d\n\nAdvocacy groups \u2014 including those that supported the gun control measure and those that took no stance \u2014 said they disagree keeping SAFE Act data secret.\n\nNew York Public Interest Research Group has neither supported nor opposed the SAFE Act. But its legislative director, Blair Horner, said he believes the number of registrants shouldn\u2019t be a secret.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t think of a policy reason why that shouldn\u2019t be public information,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt is absolutely appalling,\u201d said Barbara Bartoletti, legislative director for the state League of Women Voters, which supported the SAFE Act.\n\n\u201cThere is no question that the public should know how many weapons are being registered,\u201d she said.\n\nRobert Freeman, executive director for the State Committee on Open Government, said he agrees that the total number of registrations should be made public if that information exists.\n\n\u201cIt should be public, in my opinion,\u201d he said.\n\nThe secrecy has also upset SAFE Act opponents, some of whom had earlier sought a registration total and had been denied.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t care about names or addresses (of registrants). We just want totals,\u201d said George Rogero, who heads the Orange County NY Shooters group and runs a blog on Second Amendment issues.\n\nHe tried getting the number earlier this year under the state\u2019s Freedom of Information Law, but was turned down.\n\nRogero said the law makes a provision for getting the number with a court order but said, \u201cI don\u2019t have $15,000 or $20,000 to take (a legal fight) any further.\u201d\n\nGun rights advocates say they are interested in tallying registrations, in part, because with many local sheriffs opposed to the SAFE Act, they believe that only a handful of those with the grandfathered weapons will bother to register.\n\nNo one knows how many assault-style weapons are in New York state. Shortly after the law was passed, State Police Superintendent Joseph D\u2019Amico estimated that there could be hundreds of thousands. Others have said 1 million isn\u2019t an unrealistic number.\n\n\u201cThere is no way to know,\u201d said Rogero.\n\nThe newly banned weapons have certain military or combat-style features, such as a bayonet lug or a pistol grip.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Capitol Confidential", "description": "A major component of Gov.
