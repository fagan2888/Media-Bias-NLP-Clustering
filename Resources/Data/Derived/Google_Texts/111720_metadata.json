The deal was expected to be inked by May 1, according to Jameson spokeswoman Lisa Lombardo.\n\n\u201cWe continue to believe this merger is the strongest solution for a healthy future for Lawrence County, its residents, and surrounding communities,\u201d Mrs. Lombardo said.\n\nThe Jameson-UPMC deal, first proposed in the fall of 2014, had been in question after the state attorney general\u2019s staff raised antitrust concerns. On Monday, the attorney general\u2019s office filed an amended complaint saying UPMC\u2019s acquisition of Jameson \u201csubstantially will lessen competition\u201d in the area.\n\nBut both sides had agreed to binding arbitration and the U.S. District Court order signed by Magistrate Judge Robert C. Mitchell on Tuesday gives the deal the go-ahead while also putting in place restrictions, such as requiring UPMC to maintain Jameson as an acute care hospital for at least 10 years.\n\nThe order further blocks UPMC from terminating current health plan contracts and requires it to offer those plans a chance to extend the contracts 10 years.\n\nThe new owner cannot revoke hospital privileges of any UPMC Jameson physician \u201csolely because that physician is employed by a health system other than UPMC.\u201d\n\nThe agreement stipulates that UPMC cannot acquire any additional Pennsylvania hospitals without providing at least 120 days\u2019 written notice to the attorney general\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to further extending UPMC\u2019s world-class care to patients in Lawrence and Mercer counties,\u201d UPMC spokesman Paul Wood said.\n\nUPMC has more than 20 hospitals and more than 500 locations, mostly in Western Pennsylvania.\n\nJameson, with 1,200 employees, had been looking to partner with a larger health system for more than five years, as patient revenue flattened and the health system encountered increasing problems recruiting doctors \u2014 a common issue for rural hospitals. And between reduced reimbursement from government programs, the shift to electronic health records and complying with regulations set out by the federal Affordable Care Act, the Jameson board decided it needed an affiliation or joint venture with an outside party.\n\nJameson officials had discussions with Highmark Health\u2019s Allegheny Health Network and the Tennessee-based for-profit Community Health Systems Inc.\n\nThe two parties reached an agreement in February 2015 but still needed regulatory approval from the state attorney general\u2019s office. That office balked over concerns the deal would give UPMC, which had previously acquired Horizon Health System in Mercer County, too much control over health care in the area, leading to higher costs to consumers.\n\nIn August, under directions from the state attorney general\u2019s office, Jameson officials issued a new request for proposals seeking partnerships, even as they continued to maintain that the UPMC affiliation represented the health system\u2019s best option.\n\nSteve Twedt:stewdt@post-gazette.com, or 412-263-1963 Kris B.
