Colorado had one of those Sunday afternoon at the Coors Events Center. It can now add some red underlines and a red exclamation point.\n\nAgainst a Harvard team favored to make a third consecutive NCAA Tournament, CU used a 19-2 surge in the second half to slip past the Crimson 70-62.\n\n\u201cWe needed a big win,\u201d forward Josh Scott said. \u201cWe\u2019d played Arkansas State. And Harvard, they\u2019re not Arkansas State.\u201d\n\nNo, under coach Tommy Amaker, Harvard (4-1) is winning more than just debates. It has four starters back from the team that beat New Mexico in last season\u2019s NCAA Tournament.\n\nIt has the Ivy League preseason player of the year, guard Wesley Saunders, who nearly signed with Colorado, and a three-time all-Ivy League pick in Kyle Casey.\n\n\u201cI know it\u2019s too early to say there are must wins, but at the end of the year, you have to have some good wins on your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and avoid bad losses,\u201d said Buffaloes coach Tad Boyle. \u201cThis wouldn\u2019t have been a bad loss. But it is a good win.\u201d\n\nGood especially, Boyle said, because of \u201chow we did it.\u201d\n\nWhat Boyle called \u201ca deficiency\u201d became a habit to open the game when Colorado\u2019s shaky perimeter defense saw Harvard hit 6-of-12 shots beyond the 3-point arc for a 42-30 halftime lead.\n\nCall it fatigue. Call it altitude. Dare call it a revived defense. But the Crimson only hit 1-of-11 in the second half.\n\n\u201cHarvard is such a good ball-movement team,\u201d Boyle said. \u201cIf you\u2019re not moving on a pass, you\u2019re going to get beat. That\u2019s what happened in the first half.\u201d\n\nDown 50-41, the Buffs flexed their muscles against a Har- vard team with no starter taller than 6-foot-7. The 6-10 Scott gathered nine of his 11 rebounds and scored 10 of his 12 points during the 19-2 run.\n\nXavier Johnson and Spencer Dinwiddie, who had a game-high 17 points, hit three consecutive 3- pointers. And when Johnson scored inside, the Buffs had a 62-54 lead with 2:43 left.\n\n\u201cFifteen, 16 minutes had expired (in the second half) and they\u2019d scored 10 points,\u201d Boyle said. \u201cThat\u2019s how you get back in games \u2014 then hitting three 3-pointers helps.\u201d\n\nThe Buffs (6-1) play at Air Force (3-2) on Saturday at 2 p.m.\n\nJohn Henderson: jhenderson@denverpost.com or twitter.com/johnhendersondp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado Buffs basketball rallies to beat Harvard, pads NCAA r\u00e9sum\u00e9", "title": "Colorado Buffs basketball rallies to beat Harvard, pads NCAA r\u00e9sum\u00e9", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/11/24/colorado-buffs-basketball-rallies-to-beat-harvard-pads-ncaa-rsum/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131124__ColoradoHarvardp1.jpg", "height": 513}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131124__ColoradoHarvardp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-24T17:04:23+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T11:41:10+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "University of Colorado"}, "article_summary": "Xavier Johnson and Spencer Dinwiddie, who had a game-high 17 points, hit three consecutive 3- pointers.\nAgainst a Harvard team favored to make a third consecutive NCAA Tournament, CU used a 19-2 surge in the second half to slip past the Crimson 70-62.\n\u201cFifteen, 16 minutes had expired (in the second half) and they\u2019d scored 10 points,\u201d Boyle said.\n\u201cHarvard is such a good ball-movement team,\u201d Boyle said.\nAnd Harvard, they\u2019re not Arkansas State.\u201dNo, under coach Tommy Amaker, Harvard (4-1) is winning more than just debates."}
