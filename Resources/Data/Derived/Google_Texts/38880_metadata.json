An interim CEO should be in place by the middle of next week. He declined to get into specifics when asked whether Waldo's departure was planned as part of the new management contract.\n\nYou must login to view the full content on this page.

RCHA manages and operates small hospitals and provides consulting services, according to its website.\n\n\"We still believe very strongly we have a good group working with us, and\" RCHA is \"working on developing a business plan,\" Conway said.\n\nLast summer, the hospital's trustees and staff raised the alarm that unless more people used Cooper County Memorial's services, it faced closure within a year. The hospital has struggled with years of deficits, and small rural health providers as a whole face difficulty coping with changes in the health care industry. The overhaul of the health care industry under the Affordable Care Act has many expecting consolidation among providers as they struggle to adapt to changes in the payment system.\n\nIn Cooper County's case, it faces the additional hurdle of competing with nearby Columbia.\n\nIt's unclear how the RCHA management contract affects an effort in the Missouri General Assembly to allow hospitals in Boone and Cooper counties to work together. The legislation, which passed the Missouri House last week but is still awaiting a vote in the Senate, was pushed by area legislators and written to exempt Boone and Cooper counties from current rules prohibiting county-owned hospitals from offering services in third-class counties that already have a public hospital.\n\nThe RCHA contract, on the other hand, will allow the Boonville hospital to work with either the University of Missouri Health System or the BJC HealthCare-managed Boone Hospital, Conway said.\n\nRCHA hopes to finish a business plan on the hospital's future by the end of next week, and then the board of trustees and the community will weigh in, Conway said.\n\n\"Certainly getting community buy-in, to me, that will be an important part of it,\" he said.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=1;polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=5;
