U.S. Rep. Diana DeGette, who has represented Denver for nine terms, kicks off her re-election bid tonight in an 1880s brick foundry that has been revitalized and now houses various small businesses.

The Denver Democrat was first elected to Congress in 1996, succeeding Rep. Pat Schroeder, who retired after 24 years. DeGette, who had served two terms in the state House, will be introduced tonight by Senate President Morgan Carroll, D-Aurora.

DeGette’s district was redrawn after the 2010 census and now includes a portion of Jefferson County. No matter how it has been drawn, Congressional District 1 has performed overwhelmingly Democratic and GOP challengers have struggled.

The kickoff begins at 5:30 p.m. at the Crooked Stave Brewery at The Source, 3350 Brighton Blvd. The Source is an artisan food market that occupies the foundry in Denver’s River North District.
