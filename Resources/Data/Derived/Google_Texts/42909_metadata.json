The MIT professor has become infamous over the last few days for saying on video from last year that the Affordable Care Act passed because of its \u201clack of transparency\u201d and the \u201cstupidity of the American voter.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know who he is. He didn\u2019t help write our bill,\u201d Pelosi said during a Thursday press conference.\n\n\u201cYou have a person who wasn\u2019t writing our bill commenting on what was going on when we were writing the bill who has withdrawn some of the statements that he made,\u201d she continued. \u201cSo, let\u2019s put him aside.\u201d\n\nInterestingly enough, Pelosi does know who Gruber is \u2014 or, at least, she did, according to video from 2009.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if you have seen Jonathan Gruber of MIT\u2019s analysis of what the comparison is to the status quo versus what will happen in our bill to those who seek insurance within the exchange,\u201d explained Pelosi of the Democrats\u2019 health care proposal at a 2009 press conference. \u201cAnd our bill takes down those costs even from now and much less preventing the upward spiral.\u201d\n\nDoes Pelosi think that the American people are too \u201cstupid\u201d to believe her when she says she doesn\u2019t recognize Gruber\u2019s name?\n\nMoreover, It appears the White House is also taking measures to distance itself from the Obamacare architect.\n\n\u201cThe tax credits in the law that help millions of middle class Americans afford coverage were no secret, and in fact were central to the legislation,\u201d White House spokeswoman Jessica Santillo explained of Gruber\u2019s remarks in a statement to Talking Points Memo. \u201cNot only do we disagree with those comments, they\u2019re simply not true.\u201d\n\nH/T Mediaite", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) claimed Thursday that she doesn't know who Jonathan Gruber is despite the fact that she mentioned the Obamacare architect and MIT professor by name during a 2009 press conference regarding the health law.", "title": "Nancy Pelosi on Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber: 'I don't know...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 539, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2014/05/Nancy-Pelosi-539x400.jpg", "height": 400}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2014/11/13/nancy-pelosi-jonathan-gruber-dont-know/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "white-house-obamacare-architect", "published_time": "2014-11-13T14:02:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-13T14:03:13+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcf9a\"", "article_summary": "Moreover, It appears the White House is also taking measures to distance itself from the Obamacare architect.\n\u201cSo, let\u2019s put him aside.\u201dInterestingly enough, Pelosi does know who Gruber is \u2014 or, at least, she did, according to video from 2009.\nHer reason for attempting to distance herself \u2014 and other Democrats who have supported Obamacare \u2014 from Gruber is obvious.\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) claimed Thursday that she doesn\u2019t know who Jonathan Gruber is despite the fact that she mentioned the Obamacare architect and MIT professor by name during a 2009 press conference regarding the health law.\nHe didn\u2019t help write our bill,\u201d Pelosi said during a Thursday press conference."}
