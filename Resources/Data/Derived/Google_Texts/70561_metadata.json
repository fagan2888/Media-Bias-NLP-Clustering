According to The Jerusalem Post, Obama told Netanyahu the US \"will need to reassess our options following the prime minister\u2019s new positions and comments regarding the two-state solution\" and also \"discussed\" Netanyahu's \"comments about Israeli Arabs.\"\n\nNetanyahu assured Obama that he is, and always has been committed to a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine, but Obama reportedly told Netanyahu he did not believe him.\n\nNetanyahu has been a vocal critic of Obama's efforts to broker a deal with Iran that will, in Obama's words, make the state sponsor of terrorism a \"successful regional power.\"\n\nObama also reportedly pointedly limited his praise of Netanyahu's electoral win by noting that Netanyahu only won a \"plurality\" of Knesset seats.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A congratulatory call without any congratulations..05/25/2016 17:07:56PM EST.", "author": "Conn Carroll", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "A congratulatory call without any congratulations.", "title": "- Obama Lectures Netanyahu During Post-Election Call", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/conncarroll/2015/03/20/obama-lectures-netanyahu-during-postelection-call-n1973499", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/74/c391b891-9abf-42cb-b6e6-6eb2a8e10b49.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "A congratulatory call without any congratulations.", "title": "- Obama Lectures Netanyahu During Post-Election Call", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/conncarroll/2015/03/20/obama-lectures-netanyahu-during-postelection-call-n1973499", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/74/c391b891-9abf-42cb-b6e6-6eb2a8e10b49.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Obama Lectures Netanyahu During Post-Election Call, Conn Carroll, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd9c5\"", "article_summary": "Netanyahu assured Obama that he is, and always has been committed to a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine, but Obama reportedly told Netanyahu he did not believe him.\nObama also reportedly pointedly limited his praise of Netanyahu's electoral win by noting that Netanyahu only won a \"plurality\" of Knesset seats.\nWhen Netanyahu did win, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest criticized Netanyahu's campaign and said the Obama administration must \"re-evaluate\" their relationship with Israel.\nObama shared these concerns with Netanyahu personally when the two finally connected by phone late Thursday.\nInstead of congratulating Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on his reelection during a phone call Thursday, President Obama belittled Netanyahu's electoral accomplishments and lectured him on Iran, Palestine, and Arab Israelis."}
