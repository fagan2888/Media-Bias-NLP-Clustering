The opportunities realities and challenges of organic farming in Boulder County will be reviewed in an April 5 workshop sponsored by the county Parks and Open Space Department.

Wednesday, March 26, is the deadline for registering for the free workshop — “Is Organic an Option for Me?” — which is set for 9:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. April 5 at the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, 3080 Center Green Drive, Boulder. People can get more information and register online at www.BoulderCountyOpenSpace.org/agriculture.

Representatives from the United States Department of Agriculture, the Colorado Department of Agriculture and Colorado State University will provide information that can assist people interested in certified organic production. Industry experts will answer questions and provide resources for both experienced and new farmers as well as other community members attending.

County officials said the workshop will include discussions about Colorado’s larger agricultural economic landscape and how organic farming fits into Boulder County’s agriculture industry. Boulder County commissioners have set a policy of having 20 percent of the cropland on county-owned open space certified as organic or in the process of transitioning into organic production by the year 2020.
