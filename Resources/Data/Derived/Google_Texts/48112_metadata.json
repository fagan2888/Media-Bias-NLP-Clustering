These cases are different from many other crimes, since victims are unlikely to know most of the criminals who possess, produce or distribute images of their molestations and rapes. The lower courts were divided on whether the defendant should be required to pay the entire penalty amount himself.\n\nPaul G. Cassell, representing Amy, said the 1994 Violence Against Women Act was clear that child-pornography criminals were required to pay victims full restitution \u2014 and that every one of the perpetrators was fully liable for the violation of her rights.\n\n\u201cAmy\u2019s losses come from a vast, faceless, anonymous crowd of thousands of people scattered around the globe from Denver to Denmark, who are looking at pictures of her being raped as an 8-year-old girl,\u201d said Mr. Cassell. That \u201caggregate group of people all contribute to a loss. Each person who contributed to the loss was on the hook for the damages in their entirety.\u201d\n\nMr. Cassell asked the high court to uphold a 2012 ruling by the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals that ordered Doyle R. Paroline to pay full restitution to Amy. Paroline, who was sentenced to 24 months in prison, pleaded guilty to having nearly 300 child-pornography images, including two of Amy, on his computer.\n\nParoline petitioned the high court to overturn the 5th Circuit Court\u2019s ruling. If he prevails, it would leave intact a lower-court ruling that found that Paroline owed Amy nothing because the government could not prove that his possession of two images of her caused any of her losses.\n\n\u201cThis is a criminal-sentencing problem,\u201d Stanley G. Schneider, Paroline\u2019s court-appointed lawyer, told the justices Wednesday.\n\n\u201c[A]ll losses must be proximately caused,\u201d and the government must prove that a defendant\u2019s offense caused the victim\u2019s losses, he said.\n\nThe justices\u2019 debate centered on a provision in the 1994 law that refers to losses that are \u201ca proximate result of the offense.\u201d Courts have often awarded child-pornography victims little or no amounts of restitution because of that language.\n\nSeveral justices showed dismay that an innocent victim of a repugnant crime would receive nothing in restitution, but they also didn\u2019t appear to support the idea that a single defendant could be held financially liable for a crime that involved countless other people.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re saying \u2018contributed to the harm,\u2019 but [Paroline] makes 100 percent of the payment. That doesn\u2019t seem to me to make much sense,\u201d said Justice Antonin Scalia said.\n\nThe justices heard several potential solutions \u2014 including asking criminals to pay a partial amount, such as $1,000 an image, into a victims\u2019 restitution fund, or asking the U.S. Sentencing Commission to establish a formula for restitution in these cases.\n\nThe Obama administration, represented by Deputy Solicitor General Michael R. Dreeben, argued against all-or-nothing outcomes and suggested a formula in which a victim\u2019s restitution would be divided among the number of criminals associated with the victim\u2019s images.\n\nThat prompted Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., to ask, \u201cHow does that work for the first person\u201d convicted of having a victim\u2019s image?\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t work very well for the first person, Mr. Chief Justice,\u201d admitted Mr. Dreeben.\n\nAmy has so far received more than $1.75 million, Mr. Cassell said. Of that total, $1.2 million came from one man, a Virginia sheriff\u2019s deputy who had more than $2 million in retirement savings.\n\nA decision is expected in late June.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Supreme Court on Wednesday took up a knotty question of proportional justice, in a case posing the question of how much individual viewers of child pornography owe to the victims of abuse.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The Supreme Court on Wednesday took up a knotty question of proportional justice, in a case posing the question of how much individual viewers of child pornography owe to the victims of abuse.", "title": "Supreme Court struggles with restitution for child porn", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jan/22/court-struggles-restitution-child-porn/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/01/22/142f970c19749903490f6a7067006b6e.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/01/22/142f970c19749903490f6a7067006b6e.jpg", "description": "The Supreme Court on Wednesday took up a knotty question of proportional justice, in a case posing the question of how much individual viewers of child pornography owe to the victims of abuse.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Supreme Court struggles with restitution for child porn"}, "Author": "Cheryl Wetzstein", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Law Crime, Social Issues, Paul G Cassell, Doyle R Paroline"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd2d3\"", "article_summary": "The high court sought to find a formula for courts to use to assign restitution in crimes of child pornography.\nAmy has so far received more than $1.75 million, Mr. Cassell said.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t work very well for the first person, Mr. Chief Justice,\u201d admitted Mr. Dreeben.\nThe Obama administration, represented by Deputy Solicitor General Michael R.
