The move is a little jarring\u2014especially when Chris Christie deploys his unblinking stare\u2014but it\u2019s effective: It says, \u201cForget these other candidates; I\u2019m talking to you, voter.\u201d In their very public fight over device security, Apple and the FBI seem to be employing this same tactic. Instead of mining the tech industry or outside experts for support, the two organizations, both known for their secrecy, are breaking the fourth wall and turning to you, an American citizen and technology user. Apple fired the opening salvo last week, when it responded to a federal judge\u2019s order to help the FBI unlock an iPhone 5c that belonged to one of the shooters that killed 14 people in San Bernardino, California. In an open letter to customers, Apple CEO Tim Cook explained his opposition to the FBI\u2019s request, arguing that it would set a \u201cdangerous precedent\u201d that would harm consumer privacy.\n\nBut going public wasn\u2019t Apple\u2019s first choice: The FBI appeared to force Apple\u2019s hand. According to The New York Times, Apple asked the FBI to file its request for the company\u2019s assistance under seal. But the government chose to file publicly instead, prompting Cook\u2019s letter. As the media struggled to keep straight the details of a complex technical and legal fight, Cook and FBI Director James Comey continued over the weekend to appeal directly to Americans to explain their reasoning. In a very simply worded and direct letter posted to the Lawfare blog Sunday, Comey framed his controversial request as a routine effort to perform due diligence, while taking a moral stand on the San Bernardino investigation. \u201cWe can't look the survivors in the eye, or ourselves in the mirror, if we don't follow this lead,\u201d Comey wrote. He called on \u201cfolks\u201d to \u201ctake a deep breath,\u201d and remember the terrorist attack that set off the probe. While a federal court weighs the arguments, Apple and the FBI hope their preferred storylines prevail amongst the public. Apple countered Monday morning with a frequently-asked-questions page that broke down, in a similarly straightforward way, the facts of the case and its argument for resisting the FBI\u2019s request. And in an email to Apple employees that was shared with reporters, Cook wrote of receiving messages of support from \u201cthousands of people in all 50 states.\u201d As Cook and Comey turned toward the camera to argue candidly for their positions, they continued to kick each other under the table. After Apple was granted more time to prepare its argument against the court order, the FBI submitted an aggressively worded motion to compel Apple\u2019s compliance with its request, arguing that the company\u2019s actions \u201cappear to be based on its concern for its business model and public brand marketing strategy.\u201d While the U.S. District Court of Central California weighs the arguments, Apple and the FBI hope their preferred storylines prevail amongst the public. In Apple\u2019s frame, Tim Cook is a crusader for privacy who stands up for constitutional rights in the face of an overreaching government. The FBI would prefer that Americans see Apple as a renegade corporation that\u2019s blocking a crucial terrorism investigation to bolster its image and, ultimately, its bottom line.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In their ongoing clash, the two notoriously secret organizations are fighting for Americans\u2019 hearts and minds.", "author": "Kaveh Waddell", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "In their ongoing clash, the two notoriously secret organizations are fighting for Americans\u2019 hearts and minds.", "title": "Apple and the FBI Break the Fourth Wall", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2016/02/42_68691065/facebook.jpg?1456169470", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/02/apple-and-the-fbi-break-the-fourth-wall/470406/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/kavehwaddell"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe can't look the survivors in the eye, or ourselves in the mirror, if we don't follow this lead,\u201d Comey wrote.\nAccording to The New York Times, Apple asked the FBI to file its request for the company\u2019s assistance under seal.\nWhile a federal court weighs the arguments, Apple and the FBI hope their preferred storylines prevail amongst the public.\nBut going public wasn\u2019t Apple\u2019s first choice: The FBI appeared to force Apple\u2019s hand.\nThe FBI would prefer that Americans see Apple as a renegade corporation that\u2019s blocking a crucial terrorism investigation to bolster its image and, ultimately, its bottom line."}
