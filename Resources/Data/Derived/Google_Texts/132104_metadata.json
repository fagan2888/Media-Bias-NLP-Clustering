The first, and most significant, is that the Republican candidate, Rep. Tom Cotton, is in fact some sort of android. The man does not deviate from talking points. Ever. It seems unlikely that he is capable of saying something that isn\u2019t a talking point. Ask him a question on any topic \u2013 campaign ads, wars in the Middle East, domestic spending, whether or not brunch is for jerks, it doesn\u2019t matter \u2013 and he will find some way to transform his answer into a treatise on how Sen. Mark Pryor and Barack Obama are the same person.\n\nEvery time Cotton opened his mouth, he inevitably ended up denouncing Obama or Obamacare and pivoted immediately to claiming that Pryor supported the president 93 percent of the time. That, obviously, was Cotton\u2019s strategy, and it was abetted a great deal by the awful format, in which Pryor, Cotton, and the two minor party candidates were shepherded rigidly from topic to topic, allowed infrequent rebuttals, and safeguarded from follow-up questions.\n\nThe shortcomings of this format became apparent early on when, in response to a question on the responsibility of candidates to be honest in their campaign advertisements, Cotton launched into his usual anti-Obama litany. The reporter who asked the question interrupted him: \u201cAre you answering my question about what your job as a candidate is? Or are you just doing talking points?\u201d That\u2019s when the moderator jumped in and corrected the reporter for trying to make Cotton answer her question. \u201cI have to allow him to go ahead,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause we have no provision for a follow-up question right away.\u201d Thus, any danger of the debate actually getting interesting was quickly neutralized, and Cotton was free to launch right back into his talking points.\n\nSpeaking of those talking points, it\u2019s pretty clear that Cotton has no problems telling lies or getting caught in them. On matters of basic policy, he was bending and fracturing the truth wherever he could, but he reserved some of his best untruths for the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe ACA \u201cis going to cost 2.5 million jobs,\u201d Cotton said, re-upping a long-since debunked attack on the health reform law. \u201cIn Arkansas, we can expect premiums to increase by 138 percent,\u201d Cotton said, referring to an analysis of state-by-state health insurance premiums conducted last November by a conservative think tank. (Premiums in Arkansas are actually expected to decline slightly, after years of increases.) \u201cSen. Pryor voted to cut Medicare by $700 billion to pay for Obamacare.\u201d My god\u2026 are we still kicking around that hoary old chestnut?\n\nCotton also defended his vote against the farm bill, which is a pretty big deal in Arkansas, by claiming that he was just trying to shake up the status quo in Washington by decoupling the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (\u201cfood stamps\u201d) from the agricultural legislation. \u201cSen. Pryor and Barack Obama insist on doing things the old way, keeping them combined. That\u2019s the status quo,\u201d Pryor said, saying they should be voted on separately because (he didn\u2019t explain why). That\u2019s a bit of a curious statement for Cotton to make, given that he just recently released an ad \u2013 an ad he insists is completely accurate \u2013 claiming that \u201cPresident Obama hijacked the farm bill\u201d and \u201cturned it into a food stamp bill. So the \u201cstatus quo\u201d is also a \u201chijacking.\u201d Feels totally consistent to me.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Arkansas' Tom Cotton is a sophisticated anti-Obama machine -- and in his battle with Mark Pryor the stakes are high", "title": "Tea Party\u2019s talking-point robot: How Tom Cotton\u2019s unchallenged lies could tip Senate control", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Arkansas' Tom Cotton is a sophisticated anti-Obama machine -- and in his battle with Mark Pryor the stakes are high", "title": "Tea Party\u2019s talking-point robot: How Tom Cotton\u2019s unchallenged lies could tip Senate control", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/10/14/tea_partys_talking_point_robot_how_tom_cottons_unchallenged_lies_could_tip_senate_control/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/pryor_cotton.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Arkansas' Tom Cotton is a sophisticated anti-Obama machine -- and in his battle with Mark Pryor the stakes are high", "title": "Tea Party\u2019s talking-point robot: How Tom Cotton\u2019s unchallenged lies could tip Senate control", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/pryor_cotton.jpg", "creator": "@SimonMaloy", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Simon Maloy", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2014 elections, Affordable Care Act, Arkansas, Debates, Editor's Picks, Farm Bill, Food Stamps, Green Party, Mark Pryor, midterm elections, Midterms, Obamacare, SNAP, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, Tea Party, Tom Cotton, U.S. Senate", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "That\u2019s the status quo,\u201d Pryor said, saying they should be voted on separately because (he didn\u2019t explain why).\nThe first, and most significant, is that the Republican candidate, Rep.
