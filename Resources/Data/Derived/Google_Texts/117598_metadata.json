(Reuters)\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Ben Carson defended comments that the Holocaust would have been \"greatly diminished\" if the Jewish people had been armed. (Reuters)\n\nBen Carson said Thursday that Adolf Hitler\u2019s mass murder of Jews \u201cwould have been greatly diminished\u201d if German citizens had not been disarmed by the Nazi regime.\n\nThe comment, which came during an interview with CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer, was similar to arguments Carson made following last week\u2019s mass shooting at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Ore., in which he defended the Second Amendment and suggested that the victims should have fought the gunman.\n\nCarson, a retired neurosurgeon and a contender for the Republican presidential nomination, has generated headlines repeatedly for speaking his mind. His string of comments on hot-button issues includes stating that homosexuality is \u201cabsolutely\u201d a choice, saying he would not support a Muslim for U.S. president and declaring last week that he would \u201cnot just stand there and let him shoot me\u201d \u2014 a reference to the Oregon gunman.\n\n[Ben Carson: The biggest fan of Nazi metaphors in politics]\n\nCarson has criticized the news media, saying his comments are being taken out of context, but he has not backed down from the basic positions.\n\nIn the wake of a shooting that left nine dead in Oregon, 2016 Republican presidential candidates Donald Trump and former governor Jeb Bush took to the campaign trail to talk gun control.

Carson\u2019s views on abortion, homosexuality, guns and Muslims are in line with those of the GOP\u2019s conservative wing. Carson, who has no government experience, is running second to Donald Trump and is viewed more favorably than the bombastic businessman. Carson\u2019s flair for dramatic political rhetoric \u2014 he once referred to the Affordable Care Act as the \u201cworst thing to happened in this nation since slavery\u201d \u2014 helped to launch his presidential campaign.\n\n[Carson stands by Oregon comments, and Trump jumps to his defense]\n\nHis comments about gun control in Nazi Germany are explored in his just-released book, \u201cA More Perfect Union: What We the People Can Do to Reclaim Our Constitutional Liberties,\u201d in which he expands on his political views.\n\nHe said Nazi Germany was one of the regimes that he used as a cautionary tale against curbing citizens\u2019 gun rights.\n\n\u201cBut just clarify, if there had been no gun control laws in Europe at that time, would 6 million Jews have been slaughtered?\u201d Blitzer asked.\n\n\u201cI think the likelihood of Hitler being able to accomplish his goals would have been greatly diminished if the people had been armed,\u201d Carson said.\n\nBlitzer pushed a bit more: \u201cBecause they had a powerful military machine, as you know, the Nazis.\u201d\n\nHere's the answer to one of the most Googled questions about one of the most Googled candidates. (Osman Malik and Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cI understand that,\u201d Carson said. \u201cI\u2019m telling you that there is a reason that these dictatorial people take the guns first.\u201d\n\nIn interviews this week, he has rejected criticism that he was blaming the victims of Oregon shooter Christopher Harper-\n\nMercer, 26, who killed nine people and wounded nine others before taking his own life. Instead, Carson argued that he is trying to speak to potential victims of future incidents.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not complaining about any of the victims,\u201d he said on CNN. \u201cI\u2019m trying to plant the seed because this may not be the last time this occurs. And if it occurs again and there\u2019s a bunch of people, they might start thinking, \u2018You know what, we\u2019re not going to just take this.\u2019 And that\u2019s one of the things that was learned from Flight 93 on 9/11.\u201d\n\nAlthough some, including at least one relative of a shooting victim, have called his remarks insensitive, some residents of the small town where the shooting took place have expressed similar sentiments. Some have said President Obama has politicized the shootings, with his harsh criticism of Congress for not taking up gun control, and are planning to protest his visit Friday with families of the victims.\n\nCarson\u2019s campaign spokesman did not respond to requests for comment. Armstrong Williams, an adviser to Carson, said the media storms that have swirled around the candidate\u2019s comments have been \u201ca blessing\u201d because they keep his name in the news. He thinks it has helped Carson\u2019s standing in the polls.\n\n\u201cFor Dr. Carson this is a new language, a new culture,\u201d Williams said. He said that the average voter does not scrutinize candidates for verbal missteps. \u201cThey care about intent. I think people understand what Dr. Carson is trying to say.\u201d\n\nIn the most recent Washington Post-ABC News poll, 45 percent of respondents held a favorable view of Carson, while 27 percent had an unfavorable view.\n\nIn contrast, Trump registered a 35 percent favorable rating and a 60 percent unfavorable rating. Carly Fiorina, the former chief executive of Hewlett-Packard and another GOP contender, had a 35 percent favorable rating and a 30 percent unfavorable rating.\n\nDespite his tough talk about confronting a mass shooter, Carson described in a radio interview Wednesday a very different reaction to a gunman who confronted him during a holdup at a Popeyes fast-food restaurant in Baltimore.\n\n\u201cGuy comes in, put the gun to my ribs and I just said, \u2018I believe that you want the guy behind the counter. . . . He said, \u2018Oh, okay,\u2019 \u201d Carson told Karen Hunter, a host of SiriusXM\u2019s \u201cUrban View.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou just redirected him?\u201d Hunter asked.\n\n\u201cI redirected him,\u201d Carson said, chuckling.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The GOP presidential contender has become known for his controversial remarks on guns, gays and Muslims.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=678837008", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The GOP presidential contender has become known for his controversial remarks on guns, gays and Muslims.", "title": "Carson suggests that gun rights might have changed history for Jews in WWII", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/carson-suggests-that-gun-rights-might-have-prevented-the-holocaust/2015/10/08/99a82d9e-6df2-11e5-9bfe-e59f5e244f92_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/10/08/National-Politics/Images/GOP_2016_Carson_Guns-0ee22-4178.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@wapovanessa"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/carson-suggests-that-gun-rights-might-have-prevented-the-holocaust/2015/10/08/99a82d9e-6df2-11e5-9bfe-e59f5e244f92_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "ben carson, muslims, ben carson hitler, ben carson holocaust", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=678837008"}, "eomportal-uuid": "99a82d9e-6df2-11e5-9bfe-e59f5e244f92", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "ben carson, muslims, ben carson hitler, ben carson holocaust"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3562\"", "article_summary": "Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson defended comments that the Holocaust would have been \"greatly diminished\" if the Jewish people had been armed.\n(Reuters)Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson defended comments that the Holocaust would have been \"greatly diminished\" if the Jewish people had been armed.\nCarson, a retired neurosurgeon and a contender for the Republican presidential nomination, has generated headlines repeatedly for speaking his mind.\nHe said Nazi Germany was one of the regimes that he used as a cautionary tale against curbing citizens\u2019 gun rights.\nHe said, \u2018Oh, okay,\u2019 \u201d Carson told Karen Hunter, a host of SiriusXM\u2019s \u201cUrban View.\u201d\u201cYou just redirected him?\u201d Hunter asked."}
