Update 1 p.m. Thursday by Avi Selk: Police have released the names of everyone involved in the wreck.

The driver of the 4Runner that smashed into the Camry is Garrett Wilhelm, 20, of Gainesville. He was on his way to visit his parents in Keller, according to Fort Worth police, who haven’t decided whether to charge him in the wreck.

The survivors from the Camry are Moriah’s family: James and Bethany Modisette in the front, and 8-year-old Isabella Modisette in the back. Their conditions are unknown.

Update 11 a.m. Thursday by Avi Selk: The medical examiner has identified the girl killed in the wreck as Moriah Modisette of Crossroads. We don’t yet have an update on the conditions of the injured.

Original post Wednesday: A 5-year-old girl was killed and three of her family members were injured in a crash Wednesday in Denton.

The family’s 1998 Toyota Camry was struck from behind about 2:45 p.m. on southbound Interstate 35W, one mile south of FM 2449, said Denton police Officer Orlando Hinojosa.

Department of Public Safety Troopers were conducting a traffic stop 1,500 away from where the crash occurred. It’s state law to pull over into the left lane or slow to 20 miles under the speed limit when there is a traffic stop being conducted and traffic was slowing in both lane. The family had stopped in the left lane when a 2002 Toyota 4 Runner rear ended them.

The girl’s parents and an 8-year-old boy were hospitalized at Denton Regional ER. The girl was sitting behind the driver and was air lifted to Cook Children’s Medical Center in Fort Worth where she was pronounced dead.

The driver of the 4 Runner may have been on his cell phone at the time of the crash, police said. That is still under investigation. He was also transported to Denton Regional ER.

It’s unknown if criminal charges will be filed.

The crash closed southbound Interstate 35W for three hours. It reopened shortly before 7 p.m.
