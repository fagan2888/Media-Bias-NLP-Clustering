A minimum wage measure, tolls and Obamacare fraud potential dominate the headlines this morning.

WAGE FIGHT: A measure that sets a $15 an hour minimum wage for SeaTac airport and surrounding business workers is leading in Washington but opponents are not giving up, with ballots still coming in. The latest results have the mandatory minimum wage winning at 53 to 47 percent.

PAY TO PASS: Oregon faces yet another roadblock on the contentious Columbia River Crossing project. The state is looking at creating its own tolling agency since Washington dropped out of paying for the new I-5 bridge from Portland to Vancouver. But whether or not Oregon can force Washington drivers to pay tolls is a tricky legal matter.

OPEN TO FRAUD: Tucked inside nearly 11,000 pages of the Affordable Care Act is a little-known provision that doles out three months of free health care to individuals who choose to default on their premiums, Tori Richards of Watchdog.org reports.
