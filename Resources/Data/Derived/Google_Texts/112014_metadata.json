That even means delivering care to the home either in person or virtually through telehealth.\n\nIf they don\u2019t, another provider, or even the local drugstore, will, experts said.\n\n\u201cIf you stand there,\u201d said Providence CEO Rod Hochman, \u201cyou will get run over.\u201d\n\nHealthcare providers, you have been warned. - Tweet this\n\nWalgreens Vice President and Strategic Clinical Partner Alan London said if the drug store chain was successfully dispensing flu shots, then why couldn\u2019t it treat chronic diseases such as diabetes?\n\nWhile the retailer is clearly not in the business of delivering high-end physician care, London said, 25 million seniors a week walk into a Walgreens store.\n\n\u201cThe number of Americans getting flu shots has gone up steadily,\u201d he said. \u201cCould we do the same with chronic disease?\u201d\n\nWalgreens provides services such as a medication management tool to let consumers keep track of their medications and doses, blood pressure and other readings.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve really advanced this idea in 500 of our stores,\u201d London said.\n\n[Also: Walgreens cuts ties with two ACOs]\n\nSo far, the feedback has been good, he said.\n\nPanelist Jeanne Pinder agreed that the retail health market is booming.\n\nBarbara Casey of Cisco said she sees a future in telehealth.\n\n\u201cI think what you\u2019ll see more in the future, this person won\u2019t go to a clinic,\u201d Casey said. \u201cBut she will pull up a laptop or smartphone, have a dialogue with a nurse and possibly get meds, possibly delivered to her home.\u201d>\n\nDigital healthcare and home delivery entails what one expert called an \u201cecosystem\u201d of players.\n\nPam Sutton-Wallace, CEO, University of Virginia Medical Center, said the system she oversees has 139 connected sites, including health centers, prisons, and the Veteran\u2019s Administration.\n\nFollow Healthcare Finance on Twitter and LinkedIn.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just in a traditional setting any longer, it\u2019s diverse,\u201d she said.\n\nA requirement on third-party payers to reimburse for telemedicine has \u201ccreated huge opportunities to create networks of care,\u201d Sutton-Wallace said. \u201cWe\u2019re able to integrate electronic health records. We\u2019ve spared Virginians 15.5 million miles of travel.\u201d\n\nJeanne Pinder, founder and CEO of Clear Health Costs, held up her smart phone and said, \u201cIn the future, we\u2019re all going to be shopping on this thing.\u201d\n\nHer organization has posted the prices for 30 to 35 procedures such as MRIs and blood tests, Pinder said, saying the difference in price can be hundreds to thousands of dollars between facilities in the same city.\n\nConsumers are taking notice, she said, and are no longer satisfied with vague answers on price when they\u2019re paying high deductibles.\n\n\u201cWhat we learned is, people are upset about their prices,\u201d Pinder said, adding they don\u2019t understand their explanation of benefits.\n\nRod Hochman, M.D., president and CEO of Providence Health & Services in Seattle, said the last 10 hires for his organization have been from Amazon, Microsoft and other high-tech businesses on the West Coast.\n\nThis is because technology companies have long put the consumer at the center of the business model, he said.\n\nProvidence is currently working with Boeing and other large companies to determine what the employers, and employees want for healthcare services, such as getting an appointment on the same day the call is made, he said.\n\nJesse Cureton, chief consumer officer for Novant Health, said he spent 30 years in the financial services business and was there during a time of transition.\n\n\u201cThere was a solid focus on the consumer,\u201d Cureton said of the finance sector, \u201cand we had to reinvent the business.\u201d\n\nTwitter: @SusanMorseHFN", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/healthcare-providers-must-adapt-changes-experts-warn-aha-panel", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/briefing.PNG", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Consumer-focused patients are changing everything about how they receive care, and to ignore that is to risk deep losses, panel says.", "title": "Healthcare providers must adapt to changes, experts warn on AHA panel"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/briefing.PNG"}, "description": "Consumer-focused patients are changing everything about how they receive care, and to ignore that is to risk deep losses, panel says.", "site": "@HC_Finance", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Healthcare providers must adapt to changes, experts warn on AHA panel"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Healthcare providers, you have been warned: Give patients what they want.&#13; That was the consensus by a panel of healthcare experts gathered by the American Hospital Association on Tuesday, who all agreed that having patients that are increasingly shopping around puts the onus on providers is to pay attention to consumer behavior and make healthcare accessible.
