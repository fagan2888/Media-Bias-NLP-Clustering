This is an age when Americans were assured that the \u201cAffordable Care Act\u201d lowered our premiums. It cut deductibles. Obamacare allowed us to keep our doctors and health plans, and lowered the deficit. Those fantasies were both demonstrably untrue and did not matter, given the supposedly noble aims of health care reform.\n\nThe Islamic State is at times dubbed \u201cjayvee,\u201d a manageable problem and a dangerous enemy \u2014 or anything the administration wishes it to be, depending on the political climate of any given week.\n\nSome days Americans are told there is no reason to restrict connecting flights from Ebola-ravaged countries. Then, suddenly, entry from those countries is curtailed to five designated U.S. airports. Quarantines are both necessary and not so critical, as the administration weighs public concern versus politically correct worries over isolating Third World African countries.\n\nEbola is so hard to catch that there is no reason to worry about casual exposures to those without clear symptoms. However, then why do health authorities still try to hunt down anyone who had even a brief encounter with supposedly asymptomatic carriers?\n\nThe deaths of four Americans in Benghazi were caused by a video that sparked a riot, and then apparently not. Various narratives about corruption and incompetence at the Department of Veterans Affairs, Internal Revenue Service, National Security Agency, General Services Administration and Secret Service are raised and then dropped. The larger truth is that these scandals must be quarantined from infecting the president\u2019s progressive agenda.\n\nLaws used to be real, not abstract. Again, not now. The administration sort of enacts some elements of Obamacare, but ignores others. Enforcement of federal immigration law is negotiable, likewise depending on the campaign cycle.\n\nThe Tawana Brawley case, the Duke men\u2019s lacrosse team accusations and the O.J. Simpson verdict were constructed fantasies. No one cared much about the inconvenient facts or the lies that destroyed people\u2019s lives \u2014 given that myths were deemed useful facts for achieving larger racial justice.\n\nIt no longer really matters much what the grand jury will find in the Michael Brown fatal shooting case. Whether he had just robbed a store, was high on drugs, was walking down the middle of the road and prompted a violent confrontation with a police officer, or whether the officer was the aggressor in the confrontation, these have become mere competing narratives. The facts pale in comparison with the higher truth that Brown was black and unarmed, and police Officer Darren Wilson white and armed. The latter scenario is all that matters.\n\nLanguage is useful for inventing new realities. \u201cIllegal alien\u201d is a time-tested noun denoting foreign citizens who crossed a national border contrary to law. \u201cUndocumented immigrant\u201d is now used to diminish the bothersome fact that millions have broken and continue to break the law.\n\nTo play down the dangers of radical Islam, an entire array of circumlocutions \u2014 \u201cworkplace violence\u201d (in the case of the Fort Hood shooting), \u201coverseas contingency operations\u201d and \u201cman-caused disasters\u201d \u2014 were the euphemisms evoked by members of the Obama administration to construct an alternate reality in which radical jihadists are no more dangerous than disgruntled office workers or gale-force winds.\n\nMany of the current campus poster icons are abject myths. Che Guevara, for all his hipster appearance, was no revolutionary hero, but a murderer who enjoyed personally executing his political opponents. Communist leader Angela Davis was awarded the Lenin Peace Prize by the totalitarian Soviet Union.\n\nPlagiarism and making stuff up are no longer considered serious offenses against the truth. Lots of notable columnists or historians have had to confess to lifting the work of others and passing it off as their own \u2014 Maureen Dowd, Doris Kearns Goodwin, Fareed Zakaria and the now-deceased Stephen Ambrose, to name a few. Most faced slaps on the wrist.\n\nEven Vice President Joe Biden once had to drop a presidential bid owing to accusations that he had plagiarized in law school and later had copied a speech from a British Labor politician. Barack Obama has had to acknowledge that in his autobiographical memoir, he used \u201ccomposite characters\u201d in some cases rather than actual people from his life. Sympathetic biographer David Remnick characterized Mr. Obama\u2019s life story as \u201ca mixture of verifiable fact, recollection, re-creation, invention, and artful shaping.\u201d\n\nSuch disregard for truth and facts is no accident, but the fruit of postmodernism. So-called \u201cafter modern\u201d thought was a trendy late-20th-century way to reduce facts to stories.\n\nProgressives thought that because traditional protocols, language and standards were usually created by stuffy old establishment types, the rules no longer necessarily should apply. Instead, particular narratives and euphemisms that promoted perceived social justice became truthful. Bothersome facts were discarded.\n\nSo far, political mythmaking has become confined to popular culture and politics, and has not affected the ironclad facts and non-negotiable rules of jetliner maintenance, heart surgery or nuclear plant operation. Yet the Ebola scare has taught us that even the erroneous news releases and fluid policies of the Centers for Disease Control can be as likely based on politics as hard science.\n\nIf that is a vision of more relativist things to come, then we are doomed.\n\nVictor Davis Hanson is a classicist and historian with the Hoover Institution at Stanford University.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Do bothersome facts matter anymore?", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Do bothersome facts matter anymore?", "title": "VICTOR DAVIS HANSON: A fact-free, postmodern make-it-up world", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/oct/29/victor-davis-hanson-a-make-it-up-world/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/10/29/10292014_b4-hanson8201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/10/29/10292014_b4-hanson8201.jpg", "description": "Do bothersome facts matter anymore?", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "VICTOR DAVIS HANSON: A fact-free, postmodern make-it-up world"}, "Author": "Victor Davis Hanson", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2946\"", "article_summary": "Victor Davis Hanson is a classicist and historian with the Hoover Institution at Stanford University.\nThose fantasies were both demonstrably untrue and did not matter, given the supposedly noble aims of health care reform.\nQuarantines are both necessary and not so critical, as the administration weighs public concern versus politically correct worries over isolating Third World African countries.\n\u201cUndocumented immigrant\u201d is now used to diminish the bothersome fact that millions have broken and continue to break the law.\nThe deaths of four Americans in Benghazi were caused by a video that sparked a riot, and then apparently not."}
