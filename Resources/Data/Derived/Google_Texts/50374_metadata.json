(NYSE: ACT) today announced that it has launched a generic version of Lidoderm\u00ae (lidocaine topical patch 5%), as part of an exclusive settlement agreement with Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Teikoku Seiyaku Co., Ltd. Actavis has begun shipping the product and believes that, under applicable Hatch Waxman rules, it is entitled to 180 days of marketing exclusivity. Lidoderm\u00ae is a local anesthetic indicated to relieve post-shingles pain.\n\n(Photo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20130916/NY79725)\n\n\"Thanks to this settlement agreement, consumers across the country are today benefitting from generic competition on Lidoderm\u00ae more than two years before the product's patents expire,\" said Paul Bisaro, President and CEO of Actavis. \"We are pleased to be able to provide patients with this more affordable treatment option, while offering yet another reminder of how patent settlements have saved and continue to save consumers billions of dollars and ensure the more-timely introduction of generic competition.\n\n\"The launch of generic Lidoderm\u00ae also marks the culmination of a $44 million expansion of our state-of-the-art pharmaceutical research, development and manufacturing facility for transdermal and topical gel products in Salt Lake City, Utah. Initiated in 2011, the expansion involved retrofitting approximately 20,000 square feet of existing space, constructing approximately 17,000 square feet of new manufacturing space and adding approximately 300 new jobs. These efforts ensured that we could maximize the talents and capabilities of our Salt Lake team in driving not only this important launch, but also planned future pipeline launches.\"\n\nFor the 12-month period ending May 31, 2013, Lidoderm\u00ae had sales of approximately $1.4 billion, according to IMS Health data.\n\nAbout Actavis\n\nActavis, Inc.
