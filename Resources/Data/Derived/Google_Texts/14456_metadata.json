These \u201cdual eligibles\u201d accounted for about 13 percent of the Medicaid population and were excluded from the GAO study.\n\nThe most expensive 1 percent of Medicaid-only enrollees accounted for about a quarter of spending among that population, and the priciest 5 percent accounted for nearly half, the GAO found.\n\nFrom there, the most expensive quarter of enrollees chalked up 75 percent of the expenditures.\n\nBy contrast, the GAO found that the least expensive half of Medicaid-only enrollees accounted for less than 8 percent of spending.\n\nThe GAO conducted the study as some states expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIn 2012, the Supreme Court said states can choose whether to extend the federal-state benefits to those making up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level. The federal government picks up the tab for expansion until 2016, a share that scales down to 90 percent in 2020 and beyond.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office has estimated that 8 million additional people could get Medicaid or Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program as a result of Obamacare by 2016, when compared to 2012.\n\n\u201cAs Medicaid enrollment increases, more extensive information about high expenditure enrollees who are not dually eligible for Medicare \u2014 that is, Medicaid-only enrollees \u2014 could enhance efforts to manage expenditures and facilitate improvements to care,\u201d the GAO said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A small-but-expensive fraction of Medicaid recipients accounted for nearly half of all spending for the program each year from 2009 to 2011, according to a new government report that studied people who do not also receive Medicare.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/8/five-percent-medicaid-enrollees-accounted-half-pro/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "A small-but-expensive fraction of Medicaid recipients accounted for nearly half of all spending for the program each year from 2009 to 2011, according to a new government report that studied people who do not also receive Medicare.", "title": "5 percent of Medicaid enrollees accounted for half of program\u2019s spending: Gov\u2019t study"}, "twitter": {"description": "A small-but-expensive fraction of Medicaid recipients accounted for nearly half of all spending for the program each year from 2009 to 2011, according to a new government report that studied people wh", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "5 percent of Medicaid enrollees accounted for half of program\u2019s"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Business Finance, Health Medical Pharma, Social Issues, Government Accountability Office, Medicare"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8910\"", "article_summary": "By contrast, the GAO found that the least expensive half of Medicaid-only enrollees accounted for less than 8 percent of spending.\nThe most expensive 1 percent of Medicaid-only enrollees accounted for about a quarter of spending among that population, and the priciest 5 percent accounted for nearly half, the GAO found.\nMedicaid had roughly 72 million enrollees and spending about $460 billion in fiscal 2013, although some also receive Medicare, a separate government-sponsored program.\nThese \u201cdual eligibles\u201d accounted for about 13 percent of the Medicaid population and were excluded from the GAO study.\nThe GAO conducted the study as some states expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act."}
