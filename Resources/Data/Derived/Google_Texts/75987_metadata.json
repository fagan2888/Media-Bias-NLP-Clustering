On Saturday afternoon, Jackson was downgraded from questionable to out, leaving the team short six starters against the Jets (3-1). Left tackle Trent Williams, center Kory Lichtensteiger, tight end Jordan Reed and cornerbacks DeAngelo Hall and Chris Culliver are all out.\n\nGruden said on Wednesday it was important that Jackson fully recovers from the left hamstring tear he sustained in the season opener before he returns to the field.\n\nOn Friday, offensive coordinator Sean McVay seemed slightly more optimistic that Jackson would be ready to go.\n\n\u201cI think a guy like that that draws that type of attention, you obviously always want him to be 100 percent,\u201d McVay said. \u201cI definitely think just his presence out there alone has defensive guys pay a little bit more attention because of the things he\u2019s been able to do over the course of his career with regards to those big plays.\u201d\n\nNow, the Redskins will have to wait at least another week for those big plays. Jackson was limited in all three practice sessions this week.\n\nThe Redskins host the Tampa Bay Buccaneers next Sunday before entering the bye week. Gruden already said it is possible that Lichtensteiger, who has a broken thumb and left shoulder injury, could be out until after the break. It seems Jackson could be ticketed for a similar timetable.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jackson was listed as questionable on Friday and was going to be a gametime decision.
