After United Healthcare announced that it would not commit to remaining in individual health insurance markets \u2014 the ObamaCare exchanges \u2014 Covered California insisted that United didn\u2019t mean they would exit all markets. California is different, they insisted:\n\nPeter Lee, executive director of Covered California, said he spoke with UnitedHealth officials Thursday and remains confident about the company\u2019s continued expansion in the state. \u201cWe have every indication they are all in for 2016 and 2017,\u201d Lee said in an interview. \u201cThe fact United did badly in other parts of the country, like many health plans did, is exactly why they want to be in California.\u201d\n\nUnited Healthcare seems to have a different take on matters:\n\nA spokesman for UnitedHealth said no decision has been made on its future participation in Covered California. \u201cWe will make an assessment of 2017 markets in the first quarter of 2016,\u201d spokesman Tyler Mason said. \u2026 UnitedHealth Chief Executive Stephen Hemsley told analysts and investors that \u201cwe cannot sustain these losses\u2026. We can\u2019t really subsidize a marketplace that doesn\u2019t appear at the moment to be sustaining itself.\u201d\n\nAnything is possible, of course, but if United Healthcare considers California to be a different case, they certainly didn\u2019t tell investors that. Their announcement yesterday didn\u2019t relate to pulling out of a certain number of specific markets; they announced that they would consider pulling out of the individual-plan market altogether. If they planned to not just stay in California but expand in that market, why not say so? It might have kept their stock price a little higher yesterday.\n\nBloomberg\u2019s Drew Armstrong explains what Covered California officials miss \u2014 that this is indeed a very big deal. The plans for expansion are over, and the fact that they\u2019re not going to promote their plans in 2016 should provide a very big clue to California bureaucrats:\n\nIt\u2019s \u201can atom bomb on health care policy,\u201d Armstrong quotes an industry source, and California still doesn\u2019t realize it\u2019s in the blast zone.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t just apply to the insurers, either. The most recent survey by Gallup show that the Affordable Care Act has not improved their perceptions of either health care quality or cost. In fact, the opposite appears to be the case:\n\nFifty-three percent of Americans rate the quality of healthcare in the U.S. as \u201cexcellent\u201d or \u201cgood.\u201d This is similar to what Gallup has found since 2013, but is down from the more positive ratings of 2008 to 2012. From 2005 to 2007, a slim majority of Americans rated the quality of healthcare in the U.S. as excellent or good. But this percentage increased slightly in 2008 after President Barack Obama was elected, reaching a high of 62% in November 2010 and again in 2012 just after he was elected to his second term. Those higher ratings could reflect optimism about Obama\u2019s promises to reform healthcare and the passage of the Affordable Care Act. However, since November 2013, shortly after the ACA insurance exchanges first opened, no more than 54% of Americans have rated the quality of healthcare in the U.S. as excellent or good. \u2026 Americans\u2019 satisfaction with the total cost of healthcare in the U.S. remains low, with 21% saying they are satisfied. Twenty-eight percent were satisfied in 2001, but satisfaction fell after that, rising again only in 2009, to 26%. This increase too may reflect optimism about the possibilities of Obama\u2019s healthcare reform. However, satisfaction has since slipped.\n\nThe current levels of approval regarding US health care ties the low for the last 15 years hit on four other occasions. The other three all came during the Bush administration. The satisfaction level on costs is almost at the Obama-era low, 21% to 20%. When Democrats took over Congress in 2007, they used those perceptions to argue for the need of an overhaul of the health-insurance market that would introduce significantly more government regulation. Only in that way could consumer choice be enhanced, care be improved, and costs brought under control, Democrats argued. Five years after arrogating that power, consumers have finally figured out that ObamaCare delivers on none of these promises.\n\nJust wait until the next round of premium hikes and carrier collapses comes \u2014 right before the 2016 election. That should be a clarifying moment \u2026. except for those who insist on remaining in denial.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "\u201cAn atom bomb on health care policy.\u201d", "title": "Covered California: Hey, United Healthcare will expand in our markets", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2015/11/20/covered-california-hey-united-healthcare-will-expand-in-our-markets/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@EdMorrissey"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "keywords": "California, Covered California, gallup, ObamaCare, United Healthcare,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-20T17:41:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-20T16:26:48+00:00"}, "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8378\"", "article_summary": "After United Healthcare announced that it would not commit to remaining in individual health insurance markets \u2014 the ObamaCare exchanges \u2014 Covered California insisted that United didn\u2019t mean they would exit all markets.\nCovered California: Hey, United Healthcare will expand in our marketsposted at 12:41 pm on November 20, 2015 by Ed MorrisseyDenial ain\u2019t just a river in Egypt \u2014 it\u2019s a government policy in California.\nThe most recent survey by Gallup show that the Affordable Care Act has not improved their perceptions of either health care quality or cost.\nBloomberg\u2019s Drew Armstrong explains what Covered California officials miss \u2014 that this is indeed a very big deal.\n\u2026 Americans\u2019 satisfaction with the total cost of healthcare in the U.S. remains low, with 21% saying they are satisfied."}
