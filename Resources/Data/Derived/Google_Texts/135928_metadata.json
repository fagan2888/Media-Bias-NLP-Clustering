BCBS of Michigan was the biggest contributor to the year-over-year decline, as its earnings fell $622 million in the first nine months of 2015.\n\nCost and utilization trends from Affordable Care Act state insurance exchanges have been higher than anticipated and are the primary drivers of the BCBS companies' declining earnings, according to Fitch. The companies have also struggled with striking a balance between their nonprofit status and the need to make adequate and efficient investments in their business.\n\nThe outlook for the BCBS companies is brighter in 2016, as Fitch believes earnings are likely to improve this year due to premium rate increases, regulatory changes and benefit redesign aimed at improving underwriting.\n\nMore articles on payer issues:\n\n\n\nHighmark isn't the top insurer in Western Pa. anymore, UPMC analysis says\n\nMoody's: Health insurer mega-mergers to disrupt entire sector\n\nQ3 comparison: 9 things to know about how 7 major payers stack up\n\n\u00a9 Copyright ASC COMMUNICATIONS 2016.
