In fact, the idea that black Americans could overcome structural bigotry by being \u201ctwice as good\u201d as their non-black competitors is still so mainstream, Coates argues, that it\u2019s forced Barack Obama to conduct his presidency in ways a white president never would. The twice as good myth \u201csmothers\u201d Obama, Coates writes, because it asks him to sidestep the role of race in our society even though race is \u201cthe lens through which many Americans view\u201d the president, no matter what.\n\nThe result, Coates says, is that many whites only like Obama so long as he flatters their wish to put the issue of racism in America behind them, to pretend the legacy of white supremacy magically ended after the civil rights movement and to comfort themselves by pointing to their African-American president as proof that, for people of color, things in America were no longer quite so bad. For Obama, Coates argued, \u201cacceptance depends not just on being twice as good but on being half as black.\u201d And even then, as the last six years of efforts to delegitimize Obama have shown, there are no guarantees.\n\nAs the saga that began this summer in Ferguson, Missouri, reached its next crisis-point \u2014 the announcement of the grand jury\u2019s decision not to indict Michael Brown\u2019s killer, officer Darren Wilson \u2014 I\u2019ve had the \u201ctwice as good\u201d rule increasingly on my mind. Not so much in regard to President Obama, who didn\u2019t say much other than urging everyone to be reasonable (which his foes have predictably and absurdly characterized as incitement), but rather concerning the town\u2019s dogged pro-Brown protesters, who have no intention of letting the grand jury\u2019s decision be the final word. Yet despite their being peaceful, respectful and disciplined in the weeks since this summer\u2019s chaos, the overwhelming majority of commentary has been focused on these protesters. The essential message? Be twice as good.\n\nTo be clear, anyone who participated in the Occupy Wall Street protests that swept the nation in late 2011 is familiar with this dynamic \u2014 probably more viscerally than they wish. As is happening now to the protesters in Ferguson, the people involved in OWS were routinely described as so unruly and so unreasonable that they risked delegitimizing their whole movement. And as is happening now in Ferguson, OWSers were often contrasted unfavorably with their supposed conservative counterparts \u2014 the Tea Party and Darren Wilson supporters, respectively \u2014 who didn\u2019t cause nearly so much fuss. Perhaps most tellingly, each group of protesters has been held to this extremely high standard despite the fact that law enforcement in both cases had quite obviously decided (First Amendment be damned) that it was not similarly constrained.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Police brutality started and escalated this controversy.
