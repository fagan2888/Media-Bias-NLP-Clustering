Well, this essentially rejiggers the way medical loss ratios are calculated in Obamacare, which in turn dictates how much money insurers, as private companies, can spend on overhead vs. paying for medical care. Except in this case, it only applies to one insurer\u2014Blue Cross/Blue Shield\u2014and is retroactive four years. One of the nation\u2019s most powerful insurance companies would get a huge fiscal break from Obamacare regulations, giving them a competitive advantage over the rest of America\u2019s insurance companies (nearly all of whom lobbied for Obamacare in the first place).\n\nA cromnibus bill wasn\u2019t just a bad idea; it was two very bad ideas rolled into one. Naturally, President Obama has indicated he will sign the bill if it passes. If the House GOP and this Democratic White House agree on appropriations, you can be sure that the legislation is bad for taxpayers. And after handing Republicans a historic victory in last month\u2019s election, we\u2019re sure voters are going to be thrilled to learn the supposed party of fiscal responsibility slapped together a metric truckload of spending bills on short notice and got to work strong-arming the bare minimum number of votes needed to get it passed.\n\nThere are many signs that our politics are broken; one of them is the constant need to create new words to more exactly describe the terrible state of affairs. Most recently, we\u2019ve been saddled with \u201ccromnibus,\u201d which is a portmanteau of \u201ccontinuing resolution or CR\u201d and \u201comnibus.\u201d A continuing resolution is a way to appropriate funds to keep the government operational, usually done under some form of duress and/or out of a desire to avoid the hard choices involved in drawing up a new budget. An omnibus bill is a bunch of disparate bills lumped together so they can be voted on at once. It\u2019s basically a gimmick to pass unpopular bills by forcing members of Congress to approve the bad legislation along with the good.\n\nThere are many signs that our politics are broken; one of them is the constant need to create new words to more exactly describe the terrible state of affairs.
