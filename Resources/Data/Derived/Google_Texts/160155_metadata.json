The final debate before the Iowa caucuses between Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and Martin O\u2019Malley laid bare differences over gun control, health care and taking on Wall Street. ABC\u2019s SHUSHANNAH WALSHE, MICHAEL FALCONE, VERONICA STRACQUALURSI and RYAN STRUYK highlight five moments that mattered at Sunday night's debate, hosted by NBC News and YouTube and held in Charleston, South Carolina. http://abcn.ws/1KlLO9E And ABC's SHUSHANNAH WALSHE breaks down those moments and the state of the race on ABC's World News Now: http://abcn.ws/1S01SEf\n\n--ANALYSIS -- CLINTON EMBRACES OBAMA LEGACY, AS SANDERS AIMS FOR DEMOCRATS\u2019 HEARTS: The Democrats\u2019 final debate before 2016 voting starts brought clarity to the choice ahead for Democratic primary voters, in a battle that\u2019s pitting the party\u2019s head against its heart. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders offered the louder and bolder vision tonight in South Carolina, channeling some of the anger that\u2019s blossoming in both parties in 2016, ABC\u2019s RICK KLEIN writes. His is a play for the hearts of voters, including segments of the Democratic Party that are disappointed in the Obama years. Hillary Clinton, still the front-runner but facing a more intense challenge than she anticipated, offered aggressive lessons on political practicality. She urged a more intense examination of her rival\u2019s record, and embraced President Obama\u2019s legacy more fully than she has in the past. Nowhere was her appeal to voters\u2019 heads more evident than in arguing that Sanders\u2019 single-payer health care plan is dangerous for Democrats to attempt to even pursue, given the battles it took to make Obamacare law. http://abcn.ws/1ZFLezF\n\n--DEBATE SPEED READ: ABC\u2019s PAOLA CHAVEZ and JENNIFER HANSLER have more on the best lines of the night. http://abcn.ws/1U5EDrw and TOM THORNTON and ALI DUKAKIS boil down the debate in one minute. WATCH: http://abcn.ws/1JcoShV\n\n--ANALYSIS -- ABC\u2019s RICK KLEIN: Has Donald Trump met his match in Ted Cruz? It\u2019s not just the Iowa appeal that has that matchup dominating the Republican race two weeks before the caucuses. Consider how Cruz is handling Trump \u2013 and yes, it\u2019s Cruz handling Trump, and not the other way around. Trump has been trying to draw him out for months with small and often veiled attacks. Cruz refused to engage. Then the birther buzz began, courtesy of Trump. Cruz found an opening for what may go down as the most effective attacks of the race: \u201cNew York values.\u201d Cruz took his lumps for it. But he knows that being attacked by The New York Daily News, Bill de Blasio, and, especially, Hillary Clinton is a good thing in the Democratic primary. He\u2019s now focused scrutiny on Trump\u2019s past statements and positions \u2013 scrutiny he\u2019s been able to avoid via his own bluster and media ubiquity until now. Cruz has vulnerabilities of his own, including some that are only just now surfacing. Trump is now unloading on a man he now calls \u201ca nasty guy\u201d whom \u201cnobody likes.\u201d Cruz is savvy enough to know what kind of words hurt, and what\u2019s just noise.\n\nTODAY ON THE TRAIL with ABC\u2019s SHUSHANNAH WALSHE: In the morning Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and Martin O\u2019Malley will participate and speak at the King Day at the Dome this morning in Columbia. Participants will march from Zion Baptist Church to the State House steps to honor Dr. Martin Luther King and to draw attention to present day economic equalities.Clinton will then travel to Toledo, Iowa where she holds an organizing event tonight. Sanders heads to Birmingham, Alabama where he tours civil rights landmarks and attends another MLK Day rally. And Martin O\u2019Malley--who fought to get more time last night, but failed--spends the entire day in Columbia. Before the march he attends an MLK Day church service and this afternoon he speaks at a rotary club. Donald Trump also has a two state day. This morning he speaks at the place it all started for Ted Cruz: Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia. (Cruz announced his candidacy there back in March.) In the afternoon, Trump holds a rally in Concord, New Hampshire. Cruz is also in NH holding a bus tour through the state. He\u2019s making five stops starting in Keene this morning and ending in Whitefield tonight. John Kasich is also in New Hampshire. Marco Rubio has a packed day in Iowa with four town halls and a meet and greet. He begins the day with an 8AM event in Decorah and ends with a 7pm stop in Bettendorf. Rand Paul, Chris Christie, Carly Fiorina and Rick Santorum are also in the state. Ben Carson, like the Democratic candidates, is in South Carolina today with a packed day.\n\nYESTERDAY ON THE TRAIL with ABC\u2019s JENNIFER HANSLER, PAOLA CHAVEZ and VERONICA STRACQUALURSI\n\nSANDERS GOES AFTER CLINTON\u2019S SPEAKING FEES. Bernie Sanders has drawn contrasts with Hillary Clinton on health care, paid family leave and Wall Street reform. During Sunday night\u2019s Democratic debate in South Carolina, Sanders went one step further, launching arguably his most personal attacks of the former secretary of state yet, ABC\u2019s MARYALICE PARKS and LIZ KREUTZ report. NBC\u2019s Lester Holt asked the progressive what the biggest differences are between him and Clinton on the issue. \u201cWell, the first difference is I don't take money from big banks. I don't get personal speaking fees from Goldman Sachs,\u201d Sanders responded. http://abcn.ws/208VwFe\n\nSANDERS ACCUSES CLINTON OF \u2018DISINGENUOUS\u2019 ATTACKS ON GUN CONTROL RECORD. The first policy question of Sunday\u2019s debate here was aimed at Bernie Sanders\u2019 complicated gun control record. The independent senator from Vermont, who often admits he is from a state with little gun control, defended his previous votes and argued he was better positioned to bring people together on the issue, ABC\u2019s MARYALICE PARKS reports. \u201cI think Secretary Clinton knows what she says is disingenuous,\u201d Sander said during the NBC Democratic presidential debate. \u201cI have a D-minus voting record from the NRA. I support what president Obama is doing in terms of trying to close the gun show loopholes.\u201d http://abcn.ws/1WlDTA2\n\nHILLARY CLINTON ACCUSES BERNIE SANDERS OF WANTING TO \u2018TEAR UP\u2019 OBAMACARE. At the Democratic presidential debate here tonight, Hillary Clinton just made the argument she and her campaign have been making over the past week to Bernie Sanders\u2019 face. Her critique is that Sanders\u2019 single-payer health care proposal would undo Obamacare, or the Affordable Care Act, and \u201cstart over again with a whole new debate.\u201d ABC\u2019s RICK KLEIN has more. http://abcn.ws/1RvbWGI\n\nSANDERS WON\u2019T FULLY COMMIT TO CLOSING CONTROVERSIAL GUN CONTROL LOOPHOLE. Shortly before visiting Emanuel AME Church in downtown Charleston where nine people were killed last summer in a mass shooting, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders would not fully commit his support to closing the so-called \u201cCharleston loophole,\u201d a gun control provision which allowed the accused shooter to purchase his gun. ABC\u2019s MARYALICE PARKS explains more. http://abcn.ws/238enD5\n\nMARCO RUBIO GOES ALL-IN ON GUNS FOLLOWING DEBATE. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio seems to be doubling down on gun control following the most recent Republican presidential debate. In New Hampshire on Friday, Rubio stopped by a gun store for a bit of retail politics. He later held a rally at Sturm, Ruger & Co., a firearms manufacturing company in Newport, where he was gifted a rifle. \u201cMy wife and I, we're gun owners,\u201d he told the company\u2019s employees. \u201cThis our first rifle in our home. It will be a nice addition.\u201d According to ABC\u2019s INES DE LA CUETARA, Rubio said they feared President Obama or his administration making it harder for \"law-abiding people like them\" to buy guns, something he also mentioned during Thursday's debate. http://abcn.ws/1KlalLR\n\nCLINTON \u2018FLATTERED\u2019 BY KARL ROVE ATTACK AD. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton laughed off a new attack ad from a Republican super PAC run by Karl Rove during an interview Sunday on \u201cThis Week\u201d with George Stephanopoulos. The web spot, titled \u201cHillary\u2019s Bull Market,\u201d was launched by American Crossroads, which is run by the Republican strategist and former President George W. Bush adviser. After watching the ad for the first time during her interview on \u201cThis Week,\u201d Clinton just smiled. ABC\u2019s LIZ KREUTZ has more. http://abcn.ws/1OyQtXB\n\nTRUMP RAMPS UP ATTACKS ON TED CRUZ, SAYS \u2018HE\u2019S A NASTY GUY.\u2019 With two weeks left before voters in Iowa cast the very first votes in the 2016 presidential election, Republican front-runner Donald Trump is turning up the heat on his fiercest rival in the Hawkeye State -\u2013 Sen. Ted Cruz, ABC\u2019s JOHN SANTUCCI reports. \"I don't think Ted Cruz has a great chance, to be honest with you,\" Trump told ABC\u2019s GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS in an interview on \u201cThis Week\u201d Sunday. http://abcn.ws/1nbful9\n\nIN CASE YOU MISSED IT\n\nSPRINGSTEEN SUPERFAN CHRIS CHRISTIE HAS \u2018FALLEN IN LOVE WITH ADELE.\u2019 It\u2019s no secret that New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is a diehard Bruce Springsteen fan, ABC\u2019s JORDYN PHELPS notes. But when asked to pick just one favorite music artist during a town hall in Iowa tonight, the Republican presidential candidate revealed he has developed a musical crush on a second artist: Adele. http://abcn.ws/1JTxuKv\n\nWHO\u2019S TWEETING?\n\n@billclinton: Details matter. @HillaryClinton says what she's going to do and how.
