A fishing hole somewhere far away from the finish line in Beijing.\n\nAs other runners wrap up their preparation for world championships, Symmonds plans to retreat into nature seeking solitude after being left off the U.S. squad for worlds over a uniform squabble.\n\nIt\u2019s a way for the middle distance runner to clear his mind and deal with the \u201cfrustration and letdown that I\u2019m experiencing right now,\u201d he said.\n\nThe defending world runner-up at 800 meters refused to sign a contract that USA Track and Field requires of all athletes before they\u2019re placed on the team. When the official roster was named Monday, Symmonds wasn\u2019t on it despite his win at U.S. championships in June.\n\nFor Symmonds, the issue is Nike\u2019s standing as USATF\u2019s official uniform sponsor. Anyone going to Beijing later this month on the U.S. team is required to wear Nike gear at team functions. Symmonds is sponsored by a rival shoe company, Brooks, and wanted it clearly spelled out what constitutes a team function.\n\n\u201cI guess a small part of me thought they weren\u2019t stupid enough to leave me off the team,\u201d Symmonds said. \u201cApparently, they are.\n\n\u201cEmotionally and physically, I\u2019m beat up right now.\u201d\n\nExcept for the exclusion of Symmonds, there were no surprises on the roster released Monday. There are five defending world champions on the U.S. squad, including Ashton Eaton (decathlon), LaShawn Merritt (400 meters), David Oliver (hurdles), Brittney Reese (long jump) and Brianna Rollins (hurdles). Marquee sprinters such as Justin Gatlin, Tyson Gay and Allyson Felix are also on the team.\n\nTaking Symmonds\u2018 place in the 800 is Clayton Murphy, who finished fourth at nationals.\n\nThe 31-year-old Symmonds is known for taking stances on social and business issues that surround what he believes is a widely corrupt world of track and field. He said he couldn\u2019t sit idly by on this topic, believing that giving Nike so much power on what athletes can and can\u2019t wear at major events may hinder sponsorship deals down the road.\n\n\u201cWe have to wear Team USA kit at all official Team USA functions, which is fine. I\u2019m fine with it,\u201d said Symmonds, who plans to eschew training for a bit to fish and rock climb. \u201cThe problem is they never define what a Team USA function is. They do that almost on purpose so they can call anything a Team USA function.\u201d\n\nUSATF makes about $20 million a year in a sponsorship contract with Nike that was recently extended to run through 2040.\n\nThe federation issued a statement Monday, saying \u201cthe only restriction USATF places on athletes\u2019 apparel or appearance at any time is when they represent the United States in national team competitions, award ceremonies, official team press conferences, and other official team functions tied to these national team events.\u201d\n\nUSATF said it invests more than 50 percent of its revenue directly into athlete support.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to continuing to expand our programs for athletes, and we hope to see Nick on future National Teams,\u201d the statement said.\n\nSymmonds was a Nike-sponsored athlete for about seven years before switching to Brooks last year. He did so because, \u201cI needed a company that could work with me and match my personality a little bit better,\u201d Symmonds said.\n\nHe won the 800 at the national championships in June, finishing in a time of 1 minute, 44.53 seconds. Symonds decided to skip lucrative competitions in Europe to concentrate on his training in Seattle, so he could be in prime shape for Beijing. He felt like he was possibly even in better condition than when he earned silver at the 2013 world championships in Moscow.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to get a chance to find out what I can do,\u201d Symmonds said. \u201cThat\u2019s a travesty.\u201d\n\nAlthough he has an airline ticket and a visa into China, Symmonds isn\u2019t sure if he will attend as a spectator or watch from home.\n\n\u201cI want to apologize to the fans who want to see me run,\u201d Symmonds said. \u201cI just feel that I can\u2019t go out there and put on that Team USA jersey and feel good about it, while all the athletes are being mercilessly bullied and threatened by USATF at the same time.\u201d\n\nAP National Writer Eddie Pells contributed.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Nick Symmonds' next destination?
