Roger Wicker of Mississippi, chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said that helps explain why he's turning to the GOP newcomers more often these days to raise money ahead of next year\u2019s elections.\n\n\"We found with the freshman class there's a good bit of star power,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cA lot of our freshmen are doing the surrogate work for me because major donors want to get to know them.\"\n\nIn recent weeks, Cassidy has called supporters, dined with donors in New Orleans and met with others in New York City.\n\nCassidy said he and the other freshmen usually don\u2019t ask for money directly. Instead, he said, they talk to donors about issues important to them. For Cassidy that\u2019s dyslexia, mental health and repealing the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\"(Donors) come because they want to support a conservative agenda, but they also wish to discuss that agenda,\" said Cassidy, a physician who defeated Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu. \u201cSo when you go, it isn\u2019t, \u2018Hey can you support us financially?' It\u2019s, 'Let\u2019s talk about mental health.'\"\n\nBesides Cassidy and Tillis, the GOP newcomers include Joni Ernst of Iowa, Tom Cotton of Arkansas, Cory Gardner of Colorado, James Lankford of Oklahoma, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, Ben Sasse of Nebraska, Steve Daines of Montana, Mike Rounds of South Dakota, David Perdue of Georgia and Dan Sullivan of Alaska.\n\n\u201cThere were a lot people interested in states like North Carolina, and Colorado and Arkansas,'' Tillis, who unseated Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan, said of the 2014 elections. \"So we found ourselves \u2014 many of the freshmen members \u2014 traveling across the country to convince potential supporters that we would win a majority.\"\n\nGary Peters of Michigan was the only non incumbent Democrat to win a Senate election in 2014.\n\nWicker said GOP donors \"are very responsive to the newcomers because they like what they see. It\u2019s old hat to see people like (Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch) and me. They know what we\u2019re likely to say.\"\n\nWicker said it helps that freshmen like Cassidy have a medical background, particularly as the GOP pushes to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Cassidy and his wife, Laura, a retired surgeon, know health issues \u201cinside out,'' Wicker said.\n\n\"So frankly when somebody is spouting the company line, it\u2019s helpful to have a Cassidy speak up and say, when the rubber meets the road on this particular health issue, here is how it's actually going to go down,\" he said.\n\nLarry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics, said it makes \"perfect sense\" for Wicker to tap his freshmen for help with donations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a smart move because the Republicans elected some stars in 2014 \u2014 people who have broad national appeal,\" he said. \u201cThe Republicans need these younger people with pizzazz to impress donors. Donors want to know that they\u2019re giving to a cause that will be successful.\"\n\nNext year, Republicans will defend 24 Senate seats. Democrats will defend 10.\n\nNational Democrats don't have a deep bench of freshman members to tap, but they say the battle for money is far from over.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve out raised the NRSC eight out of 10 months this year despite being in the minority, and that\u2019s a sign of how strong our candidates are,\" said Lauren Passalacqua, a spokeswoman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.\n\nSen. Bill Cassidy, R-La. (Photo: Courtesy)\n\nThe DSCC has raised $42 million this election cycle, compared to $35 million for the NRSC, according to reports filed with the Federal Election Commission. Democrats have $9.6 million with $5.7 million in debt. The NRSC has $10.3 million with no debt.\n\nTillis said helping the NRSC is a priority. He said without the committee's support last year he might not have won his race.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll go anywhere the (committee) needs me to go to help them be successful in November,\" he said.\n\nCassidy said he also welcomes \u201cany opportunity to make our case\" to donors.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re just folks who are interested in supporting conservative causes,'' he said. \"We\u2019ll continue to travel the country.\"\n\nContact Deborah Barfield Berry at dberry@gannett.com.
