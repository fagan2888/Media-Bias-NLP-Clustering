Her term ends in January.\n\nFeisty on immigration\n\nA feisty Republican who rose up through local politics to the state's highest office, Brewer generated national headlines in recent years for her public opposition to President Barack Obama on border security and immigration reform.\n\n\"First entering public service as a mother concerned about the workings of her local school board, Governor Brewer has served with distinction at every level of state and local government over the last three decades,\" veteran Republican Sen. John McCain said Wednesday, calling her \"a great champion for our state.\"\n\nAs secretary of state, Brewer automatically ascended to the gubernatorial gig in 2009 when Gov. Janet Napolitano left the job to head the Department of Homeland Security under Obama. Brewer then easily won election to a full term in 2010.\n\nJUST WATCHED Ariz. gov.: 'I have vetoed SB 1062' Replay More Videos ...

The strict immigration measure, also known as the \"show me your papers\" act, allowed law enforcement to ask people for legal documents.\n\n\"Show me your papers\" law\n\nCritics complained the measure would lead to racial profiling, and the U.S. Supreme Court eventually struck down some provisions of it but left intact the controversial section allowing police to check immigration status while enforcing other laws.\n\nThe issue gained Brewer the reputation of conservative firebrand, and she enhanced it in 2012 when she famously wagged her finger at Obama during a face-to-face encounter on an airport runway when he visited Arizona.\n\nIn her bid for reelection that year, she won the endorsement of the National Rifle Association even though her primary opponent sat on the organization's board of directors.\n\nThe NRA gave Brewer an A+ rating and under her leadership, Arizona became one of three states to allow people to carry concealed weapons without a permit. In addition, people can take concealed weapons into restaurants or bars with a permit if no alcohol is consumed.\n\nHowever, her conservative credentials took a hit in 2013 when she decided Arizona would participate in the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nA moderate side\n\nSome other conservative governors chose for their states to opt out instead of accepting federal money to pay for the expansion, but Brewer called it a \"moral\" obligation to provide health care for the poor and uninsured.\n\nIn February, Brewer vetoed a controversial state bill that would have allowed business owners asserting their religious beliefs to deny service to gay and lesbian customers.\n\nIf she had accepted the measure, Arizona could have faced litigation and a boycott, potentially harming Arizona's economy and tourism industry as well as the 2015 Super Bowl to be played there.\n\nBrewer cited the business community's opposition to the bill in announcing her veto.\n\nArizona law dictates that a governor can't run for more than two consecutive terms, and her time in office before she was elected in 2010 would count as a full four-year term.\n\nDiffering opinions exist on whether Brewer could be eligible, but she made clear Wednesday she would step down, vowing to \"work until my final hours completing the people's business.\"\n\n\"Both my pen and my veto stamp have plenty of ink,\" she said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jan Brewer, the finger-wagging, gun-loving Arizona governor known as a conservative firebrand with flashes of moderation, is stepping down.", "pubdate": "2014-03-12T21:03:02Z", "author": "By Tom Cohen and Ashley Killough, CNN", "og": {"site_name": "CNN", "description": "Jan Brewer, the finger-wagging, gun-loving Arizona governor known as a conservative firebrand with flashes of moderation, is stepping down.", "pubdate": "2014-03-12T21:03:02Z", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2014/03/12/politics/brewer-profile/index.html", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/140312152114-sot-az-gov-jan-brewer-no-reelection-00013213-t3-entertainment.jpg", "type": "article"}, "section": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 80401312489}, "thumbnail": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/140312152114-sot-az-gov-jan-brewer-no-reelection-00013213-t3-entertainment.jpg", "source": "CNN", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.cnn.com/2014/03/12/politics/brewer-profile/index.html"}, "keywords": "politics, Jan Brewer's successor probably won't be as flamboyant - CNNPolitics.com", "lastmod": "2014-03-12T21:03:02Z", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "As secretary of state, Brewer automatically ascended to the gubernatorial gig in 2009 when Gov.\nIn February, Brewer vetoed a controversial state bill that would have allowed business owners asserting their religious beliefs to deny service to gay and lesbian customers.\nJanet Napolitano left the job to head the Department of Homeland Security under Obama.\nIn addition, people can take concealed weapons into restaurants or bars with a permit if no alcohol is consumed.\nThe strict immigration measure, also known as the \"show me your papers\" act, allowed law enforcement to ask people for legal documents."}
