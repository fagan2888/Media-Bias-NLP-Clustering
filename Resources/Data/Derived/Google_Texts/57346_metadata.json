Bobby Jindal took the GOP-controlled Congress to task Friday for their first five months in power, blasting them for their actions on President Barack Obama\u2019s executive action on immigration and Obamacare.\n\nIn an interview with conservative radio host Laura Ingraham, Jindal slammed GOP leadership in both chambers for waving the \u201cwhite flag of surrender\u201d on amnesty, adding that the Congressional GOP is \u201csetting ourselves up for defeat again\u201d by not offering up an alternative to Obamacare.\n\nJindal made the comments on the heels of news that he will be announcing his 2016 intentions on June 24.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s my concern and skepticism about just getting any Republican in there,\u201d Jindal said when asked if Jeb Bush could make big changes if elected in 2016. \u201cLook at what happened when we took the Senate back. I remember these great, soaring campaign promises last year, it wasn\u2019t that long ago.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Give us the Senate and we\u2019ll repeal Obamacare. Give us the Senate we\u2019ll stop illegal amnesty. Give us the Senate, we\u2019ll reduce government spending and balance the budget,'\u201d Jindal said imitating those promises. \u201cYou know, look what\u2019s happened: White flag of surrender on amnesty. They passed a toothless bill on this Iran bill \u2014 actually makes it worse not better in terms of Congressional oversight.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at Obamacare, they\u2019ve not even passed, they\u2019ve not even shown the American people how they would repeal and replace it, and I\u2019m worried,\u201d Jindal said. \u201cI think the Supreme Court\u2019s going to rule the way that it should. That these states \u2014 there there should not be mandates on these states that have a federal exchange, but what I worry about is Republicans in Congress are setting ourselves up for defeat again going out there again with a plan to repeal Obamacare and replace it, and they\u2019re going to put themselves in a corner. That\u2019s why you already hear Republicans saying \u2018well, maybe we need to put a band-aid or a patch on it.\u201d\n\nJindal went on to liken the outset of the 114th Congress to when the GOP controlled the legislative branch during President George W. Bush\u2019s tenure in office.\n\n\u201cAt the same time period, when we had a Republican president, a Republican Congress. Thats when we got No Child Left Behind. That\u2019s when we got Part D in Medicare without Medicare reform, without premium support,\u201d Jindal said. \u201cIt is absolutely right to criticize President Obama for $18 trillion of debt, but it didn\u2019t just start under President Obama. I think, in part, we have Republicans in D.C. who have just become part of the problem. They want to go along to get along. Boy, I think that\u2019s why we need conservatives.\u201d\n\nWATCH:\n\n", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Al Weaver", "description": "Bobby Jindal took the GOP-controlled Congress to task Friday for their first five months in power, ripping them for their actions on amnesty and Obamacare.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Louisiana Gov.
