Many insurers view health IT as being on the cutting edge.\u201dAs insurers experiment with new payment models related to population health management, they're particularly interested in cost transparency tools and data and analytics, he said.The new business lines allow insurers to diversify and strengthen their revenue base, said Jonathan Krieger, managing director at investment bank Berkery Noyes, which focuses on the technology sector.\u201cThere's a lot of activity in the space,\u201d he said. \u201cThey need to look for other ways to maintain their margins.\u201dIn 2013, for instance, UnitedHealth Group's Optum division, which works in technology and population health management among other specialties, saw 26% growth in revenue and 61% growth in operating earnings. That helped contribute to UntiedHealth Group's overall strong performance for the year.In its core insurance business, UnitedHealth saw its 2013 operating margin decline to 6.4%, down from 7.6% the previous year. But Optum's operating margin increased to 6.2% from 4.9% in 2012.On a second-quarter earnings call, Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini said the company remains active in the M&A market, particularly in the international and technology space. And addressing where Aetna is looking, \u201cit's definitely technology,\u201d he said. Cigna CEO David Cordani similarly pointed to \u201congoing technological investments\u201d as one area of focus in the second half of the year, when asked on the company's most recent earnings call.In the rapidly growing digital health space, two of the most active acquirers in 2013 were Sandbox Industries, a venture capital firm backed by BlueCross BlueShield Venture Partners, and Lemhi Industries, another VC firm that counts UnitedHealth Group as an investor.While the overall number of publicly disclosed deals in the insurance sector have remained small, Modern Healthcare's quarterly M&A Watch report found that 55.6% of transactions in the second quarter involved cost containment companies. Another 22.2% of deals focused on services such as administrative and benefit management solutions.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#0a365e", "description": "Health insurance companies, now required to spend the lion's share of premium revenue on patient care, are looking for higher investment returns elsewhere.
