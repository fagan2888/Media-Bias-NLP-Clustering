Yes.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s call for a database to track Muslims in the U.S. is one example, Cruz says. But he refused to condemn the rhetoric of another Republican who could help him win Iowa\u2019s leadoff caucuses, Rep. Steve King, the influential conservative who has described immigrants living in the country illegally as disease-ridden-and spent the weekend campaigning at Cruz\u2019s side.\n\nRELATED CONTENT\n\n\u201cI cannot help the language that others use,\u201d Cruz said in the interview. \u201cI can only help the words that come out of my own mouth.\u201d\n\nTaken together, they are remarkable statements for a conservative firebrand who rarely, if ever, shows signs of moderation. Yet in the crowded and unruly 2016 Republican primary, Cruz is trying to position himself as the grown-up alternative to Trump and Ben Carson, two inexperienced and undisciplined front-runners who have so far captivated their party\u2019s most passionate voters by riding a wave of anti-immigrant rhetoric.\n\nAs Carson\u2019s support appears to soften, and Trump struggles to say with precision what are his exact plans for increasing surveillance of potential threats in the wake of the Paris attacks, Cruz is ramping up his pitch and trying to cast himself not just as an outsider \u2013 but an electable outsider at a time of widespread mistrust of Washington.\n\n\u201cI do not believe either one of them is going to be the nominee,\u201d Cruz told the AP about Carson and Trump. \u201cI am working very hard to win every one of their supporters.\u201d\n\nCruz spoke to AP at the end of a week in which Carson, who previously said he wouldn\u2019t support a Muslim president, likened dealing with Syrian refugees to the handling of \u201crabid dogs\u201d and said he would support government monitoring of any group deemed radical and \u201canti-American.\u201d\n\nHaving described Mexican immigrants as rapists and criminals in his announcement speech, Trump this week said he would \u201cabsolutely\u201d support a mandatory database to track Muslims in the U.S. He later said he wanted a \u201cwatch list\u201d for Syrian refugees and \u201csurveillance of certain mosques.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, Cruz has reacted aggressively to the Paris attacks and his is targeting same slice of the Republican electorate as the two front-runners. He introduced legislation this week entitled the \u201cTerrorist Refugee Infiltration Prevention Act\u201d that would allow U.S. entry only to Christian fleeing war-torn Syria. That comes after Cruz, whose Cuban-born father first immigrated to Canada and then to the U.S., last week outlined an immigration policy that would dramatically increase deportations, add hundreds of miles to the wall on the Mexican border and suspend a program that grants work visas to high-skilled immigrants, a reversal of his previous position.\n\nBut the Harvard-educated attorney who served five years as the Texas solicitor general has done so while avoiding the explosive language employed by Trump and Carson, which critics say reeks of xenophobia \u2013 if not outright bigotry.\n\n\u201cI am the son of an immigrant who came from Cuba with nothing, came here legally,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cAnd my view, which I think the vast majority of Americans share, is very simple: Legal good. Illegal bad.\u201d\n\nAnd yet even while suggesting some Republicans have gone too far with their rhetoric, Cruz spent the weekend campaigning alongside Iowa Rep. Steve King, a favorite of evangelical voters and one of his party\u2019s most outspoken hardliners on the issue.\n\nKing, who endorsed Cruz this week, has described immigrants living in the country illegally as disease-ridden and compared them to drug mules and livestock. He is perhaps best-known for a 2013 comment attacking children of such immigrants: \u201cFor everyone who\u2019s a valedictorian, there\u2019s another 100 out there who weigh 130 pounds \u2013 and they\u2019ve got calves the size of cantaloupes because they\u2019ve been hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert.\u201d\n\nWith King riding in the second vehicle of Cruz\u2019s two-car caravan, Cruz refused to condemn such comments when pressed. He also declined to name any Republicans whose rhetoric on immigration has been \u201cunhelpful.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not going to approach this election like a theater critic \u2013 giving my reviews of every word uttered by every other Republican,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cI\u2019m going to focus on my message.\u201d\n\nAnd while that message may be tempered compared to that Trump and Carson, Cruz\u2019s efforts to paint himself as the electable outsider haven\u2019t won over some of his critics.\n\n\u201cI have serious reservations at this point about Ted Cruz,\u201d said Alfonso Aguilar, a Republican who served in the George W. Bush administration and now leads the Latino Partnership for Conservative Principles\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s allied himself with Steve King,\u201d Aguilar said, suggesting that Cruz has turned his back on his immigrant roots.\n\nKing, meanwhile, heaped praise on Cruz as they crisscrossed Iowa together. The congressman introduced the presidential contender as \u201cthe man I believe will restore America\u2019s soul.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ted Cruz is trying to position himself as an electable conservative alternative to Donald Trump and Ben Carson.", "pubdate": 20151122, "og": {"site_name": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "Ted Cruz is trying to position himself as an electable conservative alternative to Donald Trump and Ben Carson.", "title": "Cruz moderates tone, hoping to boost electability", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/RTS6O9E.jpg", "url": "http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/cruz-moderates-tone-hoping-to-boost-electability/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "Ted Cruz is trying to position himself as an electable conservative alternative to Donald Trump and Ben Carson.", "title": "Cruz moderates tone, hoping to boost electability", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/RTS6O9E.jpg", "creator": "@newshour", "site": "@newshour", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"app_id": 114150878604116}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newshour", "tag": "Ted Cruz"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "2016 presidential campaign, conservatism, immigration, Iowa, NewsHour Weekend, rhetoric, Sioux City, Ted Cruz"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2c96\"", "article_summary": "\u201cTone matters,\u201d Cruz, the son of a Cuban immigrant, told The Associated Press in an interview between campaign stops.\n\u201cI do not believe either one of them is going to be the nominee,\u201d Cruz told the AP about Carson and Trump.\nKing, who endorsed Cruz this week, has described immigrants living in the country illegally as disease-ridden and compared them to drug mules and livestock.\nYes.\u201dDonald Trump\u2019s call for a database to track Muslims in the U.S. is one example, Cruz says.\nKing, meanwhile, heaped praise on Cruz as they crisscrossed Iowa together."}
