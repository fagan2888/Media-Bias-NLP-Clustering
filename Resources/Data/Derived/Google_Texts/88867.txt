A one-on-one dinner in Fort Collins that originated on a dating website allegedly turned into an armed robbery, officials said Saturday.

A 45-year-old man and 18-year-old woman Kira Abbott retired to the man’s room at a America’s Best Value Inn at 4333 E. Mulberry St. after dinner, according to a Larimer County Sheriff’s Office news release.

Once inside the room, Abbott allegedly sent a text message and opened the room’s front door where Elijah Altergott, 20, was waiting, the release said.

Altergott allegedly pointed a handgun at the victim and he and Abbott took the victim’s wallet, police said.

Larimer County deputies identified a possible residence for Altergott and Abbott and recovered evidence of the robbery during a search warrant.

Altergott and Abbott were taken into custody and booked into Larimer County Jail on charges of aggravated robbery and theft, police said.

The investigation into this incident is ongoing, and deputies have no further information at this time.
