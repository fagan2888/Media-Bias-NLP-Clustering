She was 40, she thought. It was time.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t until weeks later when Robach found out \u2014 alone \u2014 that her results came back positive for breast cancer.\n\n\u201cSitting in that kitchen with Marie Monville, I had cancer and didn't know it,\u201d Robach wrote for ABC News. \u201cIn fact, I would have considered it virtually impossible that I would have cancer. I work out, I eat right, I take care of myself, and I have very little family history; in fact, all of my grandparents are still alive.\u201d\n\nIt was a tumultuous year, Robach said. She was running around the country, covering stories, interviewing subjects, and raising her children \u2014 so busy that she would always slip the preventative tests under the rug. \u201cI started thinking, \u2018Wow, if I put it off, how many other people have put it off as well?\u2019\u201d\n\nRobach\u2019s diagnosis calls for a bilateral mastectomy, which will take place on Nov. 14, followed by reconstructive surgery. \u201cOnly then will I know more about what that fight will fully entail,\u201d she explained, \u201cbut I am mentally and physically as prepared as anyone can be in this situation.\u201d\n\nBreast cancer is the most common form of cancer in the United States, behind only certain forms of skin cancer. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), women received breast cancer diagnoses 206,966 times in 2010, the most recent year the data is available. In the same year, breast cancer accounted for 40,996 female deaths.\n\nCurrently, mammograms remain the most effective way to screen for early stages of breast cancer, spotting it before the growing tumors become easily detectable through self-examinations or cause symptoms. While Robach received what she called \"a tornado of tests\" thereafter, to conclusively diagnose the substance as cancer, doctors told Robach that her live mammogram, which took place in front of a viewing audience of millions, effectively saved her life.\n\n\u201cI was also told this: for every person who has cancer, at least 15 lives are saved because people around them become vigilant. They go to their doctors, they get checked,\u201d she wrote.\n\nA big part of Robach\u2019s decision to get tested, she says, was the encouragement from on-air co-star Robin Roberts, who told Robach that even saving just one life through urging people to get tested was worth it.\n\n\u201cIt never occurred to me,\u201d she said, \u201cthat life would be mine.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "amy robach, breast cancer, good morning america, gma, mammogram, mastectomy, bilateral mastectomy", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Amy Robach, correspondent for \"Good Morning America,\" revealed on-air that her live mammogram showed the early stages of breast cancer.", "title": "'Good Morning America' Host Diagnosed With Breast Cancer After On-Air Mammogram", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/good-morning-americas-amy-robach-diagnosed-breast-cancer-after-air-mammogram-262584", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/11/11/shutterstock52302265.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Amy Robach, correspondent for \"Good Morning America,\" revealed on-air that her live mammogram showed the early stages of breast cancer.", "title": "'Good Morning America' Host Diagnosed With Breast Cancer After On-Air Mammogram", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/good-morning-americas-amy-robach-diagnosed-breast-cancer-after-air-mammogram-262584", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/11/11/shutterstock52302265.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/11/11/shutterstock52302265.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Conditions", "published_time": "2013-11-11T15:28:08-05:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-11T15:28:06-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Amy Robach, correspondent for \"Good Morning America,\" revealed on-air that her live mammogram showed the early stages of breast cancer."}, "article_summary": "But it wasn\u2019t until weeks later when Robach found out \u2014 alone \u2014 that her results came back positive for breast cancer.\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), women received breast cancer diagnoses 206,966 times in 2010, the most recent year the data is available.\nIn the same year, breast cancer accounted for 40,996 female deaths.\nCurrently, mammograms remain the most effective way to screen for early stages of breast cancer, spotting it before the growing tumors become easily detectable through self-examinations or cause symptoms.\nNews correspondent for ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America,\u201d Amy Robach, was interviewing the wife of an Amish schoolteacher when a producer asked her if she would ever agree to an on-air mammogram to test for breast cancer as part of the show's GMA Goes Pink day."}
