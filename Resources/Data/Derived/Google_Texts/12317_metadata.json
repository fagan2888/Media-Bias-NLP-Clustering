Andy Puzder, the CEO of CKE, spoke to Business Insider about fast food automation after visiting Eatsa, a completely employee-free automated restaurant.\n\nAccording to Puzder, this drive for automation comes as a direct result of government intervention in the labor markets. \u201cWith government driving up the cost of labor, it\u2019s driving down the number of jobs,\u201d said Puzder. \u201cYou\u2019re going to see automation not just in airports and grocery stores, but in restaurants.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the problem with Bernie Sanders, and Hillary Clinton, and progressives who push very hard to raise the minimum wage,\u201d said Puzder. \u201cDoes it really help if Sally makes $3 more an hour if Suzie has no job? If you\u2019re making labor more expensive, and automation less expensive \u2014 this is not rocket science.\u201d\n\nAs for Pudzer\u2019s take on robots, \u201cThey\u2019re always polite, they always upsell, they never take a vacation, they never show up late, there\u2019s never a slip-and-fall, or an age, sex, or race discrimination case.\u201d\n\nWhile there may be issues with less technologically-savvy customers being unable to understand how to work the technology, Pudzer notes there is an upside.\n\n\u201cMillennials like not seeing people,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been inside restaurants where we\u2019ve installed ordering kiosks \u2026 and I\u2019ve actually seen young people waiting in line to use the kiosk where there\u2019s a person standing behind the counter, waiting on nobody.\u201d\n\nThe news comes on the heels of the recent opening of an employee free store in Sweden, run entirely through a smart phone app. In that case, the company founder realized the greatest barrier to having a 24-hour store was the cost of staffing.\n\nThe core problem with the $15 minimum wage movement, which has been gaining traction in many areas around the US, is that at a certain point, it becomes more cost effective for businesses to turn to automation or to move entirely. Like Pudzer says, what\u2019s the point in raising the minimum wage if it costs people jobs?", "article_metadata": {"description": "The CEO of a major fast food chain is looking to make the move to \"robot restaurants.\"", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Libertarian Republic", "description": "The CEO of a major fast food chain is looking to make the move to \"robot restaurants.\"", "title": "Major Fast Food Chain Wants Robot Restaurants", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://thelibertarianrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2015-12-18-Eatsa-002.0.0.jpg", "url": "http://thelibertarianrepublic.com/major-fast-food-chain-ceo-talks-robot-resturaunts/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://thelibertarianrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2015-12-18-Eatsa-002.0.0.jpg", "title": "Major Fast Food Chain Wants Robot Restaurants", "site": "@thelibrepublic", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The CEO of a major fast food chain is looking to make the move to"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 501616773}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/libertarianrepublic", "section": "Economics of Liberty", "tag": "technology", "published_time": "2016-03-18T12:44:00+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/ljoetrotter3"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Andy Puzder, the CEO of CKE, spoke to Business Insider about fast food automation after visiting Eatsa, a completely employee-free automated restaurant.\nMajor Fast Food Chain Wants Robot RestaurantsMinimum wage movement and government drive up costs of fast food employeesBy Joe TrotterThe CEO of the company that owns Carl\u2019s Jr. and Hardees is fed up with the cost of employees and has decided to begin replacing them with automated technology.\nLike Pudzer says, what\u2019s the point in raising the minimum wage if it costs people jobs?\nAccording to Puzder, this drive for automation comes as a direct result of government intervention in the labor markets.\n\u201cWith government driving up the cost of labor, it\u2019s driving down the number of jobs,\u201d said Puzder."}
