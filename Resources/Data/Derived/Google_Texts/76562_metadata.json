Joaquin Castro, D-San Antonio, predicted Tuesday that neither Gov. Rick Perry nor Sen. Ted Cruz can win the presidency in 2016, calling them both too divisive to garner broad support.\n\n\u201cWhen you get to the general election, people don\u2019t generally want either an angry person or a very harsh, shrill, partisan person,\u201d Castro said about Perry\u2019s prospects. \u201cThey want somebody \u2026 whose aim at least is to bring people together.\u201d\n\nCastro \u2014 in a rare joint appearance with twin brother Juli\u00e1n Castro, the Housing and Urban Development Secretary, at a Politico event titled \u201cLessons from Leaders\u201d \u2014 said Cruz would face a similar hurdle. The senator needs to become a \u201ctrue leader,\u201d he said, pointing to Cruz\u2019s crusade to defund Obamacare last fall as a time when Cruz lost support even among his own party.\n\nJuli\u00e1n Castro has been mentioned as a potential running mate for Democrat Hillary Clinton, and the congressman said his brother has \u201ca lot of options\u201d in the future.\n\nThe congressman endorsed Clinton for president in a September fundraising email. The housing secretary didn\u2019t join the endorsement.\n\nThe brothers didn\u2019t only talk politics on Tuesday. They joked about their sibling rivalry growing up \u2014 and their similar looks. In high school, they switched places one time, when there was a substitute teacher.\n\n\u201cHe always says the way to tell us apart is that I\u2019m a minute uglier than he is,\u201d Juli\u00e1n Castro said of his twin.\n\nBoth Castro brothers are considered rising Democratic stars in Texas. In 2012, Juli\u00e1n Castro delivered the keynote address at the party\u2019s national convention.\n\nOn Tuesday, they each noted the GOP\u2019s sweeping gains in the 2014 midterm elections, in which the party won control of the Senate and padded its House majority. Six Texas Republicans will hold committee chairmanships in the House.\n\nJoaquin Castro said that his Republican colleagues are enjoying their power, acknowledging \u201cthey\u2019re in very influential positions.\u201d He added that Texas Republicans have promoted a narrative of job creation in the state but said the reality is less rosy.\n\nHis brother agreed, arguing that Texas lacks a \u201clong-term view of success.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve moved into an era where brain power is the new currency of success in the 21st century,\u201d Juli\u00e1n Castro said. \u201cAnd Texas has not necessarily moved along at the rate that it should.\u201d\n\nThe housing secretary also spoke highly of his brother\u2019s political prospects, saying that Joaquin Castro will be well-positioned to hold statewide office in Texas if he wants to. The congressman similarly predicted Juli\u00e1n Castro\u2019s future is bright, saying \u201ceverybody knows I\u2019m his biggest supporter.\u201d\n\nThe brothers also poked fun at how infrequently they see each other, though they both work in Washington. Joaquin Castro said Congress has had so few work days that they\u2019re rarely in the city together.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the one in D.C. with the real job,\u201d Juli\u00e1n Castro joked.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RyYWlsYmxhemVyc2Jsb2cuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNC8xMi9yZXAtam9hcXVpbi1jYXN0cm8tcHJlZGljdHMtcGVycnktYW5kLWNydXotd291bGQtbG9zZS0yMDE2LXByZXNpZGVudGlhbC1yYWNlLmh0bWwv", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Kimberly Railey", "og": {"site_name": "Trail Blazers Blog", "description": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Rep.
