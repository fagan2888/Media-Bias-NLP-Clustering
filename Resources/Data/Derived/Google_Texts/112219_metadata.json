Time for Congress to fix a system rigged against our liberties.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) are congressional bureaucracies that wield tremendous power on Capitol Hill because of their role as fiscal scorekeepers and referees. Unfortunately, these bureaucracies lean to the Left. When CBO does economic analysis or budgetary estimates, for instance, the bureaucrats routinely make it easier for politicians to expand the burden of government spending.\n\nThis cartoon puts it more bluntly: One man asks, \u201cAre you saying if we repeal this huge, new entitlement program it will add to the deficit?\u201d The other replies: \u201cSure. Just ask the CBO!\u201d When JCT does revenue estimates, the bureaucrats grease the skids for anti-growth tax policy by overstating revenue losses from lower tax rates and overstating revenue gains from higher tax rates.\n\nExamples of Tax-and-Spend Bias Here are some examples of CBO\u2019s biased output.\n\nRegarding the CBO, Veronique de Rugy of Mercatus hit the nail on the head.\n\nThe CBO\u2019s consistently flawed scoring of the cost of bills is used by Congress to justify legislation that rarely performs as promised and drags down the economy. \u2026CBO relies heavily on Keynesian economic models, like the ones it used during the stimulus debate. Forecasters at the agency predicted the stimulus package would create more than 3 million jobs. \u2026What looks good in the spirit world of the computer model may be very bad in the material realm of real life because people react to changes in policies in ways unaccounted for in these models.\n\nAnd the Wall Street Journal opines wisely about the JCT\u2019s real role: \u201cJoint Tax typically overestimates the revenue gains from raising tax rates, while overestimating the revenue losses from tax rate cuts. This leads to a policy bias in favor of higher tax rates, which is precisely what liberal Democrats wanted when they created the Joint Tax Committee.\u201d Amen. For all intents and purposes, the system is designed to help statists win policy battles. No wonder only 15 percent of certified public accountants agree with JCT\u2019s biased approach to revenue estimates.\n\nWhat Congress Should Do about These Bureaucracies So what\u2019s the best way to deal with this mess? Some Republicans on the Hill have nudged these bureaucracies to make their models more realistic. That\u2019s a helpful start, but I think the only effective long-run option is to replace the top staff with people who have a more accurate understanding of fiscal policy. That\u2019s exactly what I said to Peter Roff, a columnist for U.S. News and World Report.\n\n\u2026the new congressional leadership should be looking at ways to reform the way the institution does its business \u2013 and the first place for it to start is the Congressional Budget Office. Most Americans don\u2019t know what the CBO is, how it was created or what it does. They also don\u2019t know how vitally important it is to the legislative process, especially where taxes, spending and entitlement reform are concerned. As Dan Mitchell, a well-respected economist with the libertarian Cato Institute, puts it in an email, the CBO \u2018has a number-crunching role that gives the bureaucracy a lot of power to aid or hinder legislation, so it is very important for Republicans to select a director who understands the economic consequences of excessive spending and punitive tax rates.\u2019\n\nHeck, it\u2019s not just \u201cvery important\u201d to put in a good person at CBO (and JCT). As I\u2019ve written before, it\u2019s a test of whether the GOP has both the brains and resolve to fix a system that\u2019s been rigged against them for decades. So what will happen? I\u2019m not sure, but Roll Call has a report on the behind-the-scenes discussions on Capitol Hill.\n\nFlush from their capture of the Senate, Republicans in both chambers are reviewing more than a dozen potential candidates to succeed Douglas W. Elmendorf as director of the Congressional Budget Office after his term expires Jan. 3. \u2026The appointment is being closely watched, with a number of Republicans pushing for CBO to change its budget scoring rules to use dynamic scoring, which would try to account for the projected impact of tax cuts and budget changes on the economy.\n\nSo who will it be? The Wall Street Journal weighs in, pointing out that CBO has been a tool that bloats government.\n\n\u2026the budget rules are rigged to expand government and hide the true cost of entitlements. CBO scores aren\u2019t unambiguous facts but are guesses about the future, biased by the Keynesian assumptions and models its political masters in Congress instruct it to use. Republicans who now run Congress can help taxpayers by appointing a new CBO director, as is their right as the majority. \u2026The Tax Foundation\u2019s Steve Entin would be an inspired pick.\n\nI disagree with one part of the above excerpt. Steve Entin is superb, but he would be an inspired pick for JCT, not CBO. I do fully agree with the WSJ\u2019s characterization that budget rules are used to grease the skids for bigger government. In a column for National Review, Dustin Siggins writes that Bill Beach, my old colleague from my days at the Heritage Foundation, would be a good choice for CBO.\n\n\u2026few Americans may realize that the budget process is at least as twisted as the budget itself. While one man can\u2019t fix it all, Republicans who want to be taken seriously about budget reform should approve Bill Beach to head the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). Putting the right person in charge as Congress\u2019s official \u201cscorekeeper\u201d would be an important first step in proving that the party is serious about honest, transparent, and efficient government. \u2026CBO has several major structural problems that a new CBO director should fix.\n\nHmm\u2026 Entin at JCT and Beach at CBO. That might even bring a smile to my dour face. But it doesn\u2019t have to be those two specific people. There are lots of well-regarded policy scholars who could take on the jobs of reforming and modernizing the work of JCT and CBO. But that will only happen if Republicans are willing to show some fortitude. That means they need to be ready to deal with screeching from leftists who want to maintain their control of these institutions.\n\nIncoming: Leftist Air War over Maintaining Bureaucracies For example, Peter Orszag, a former CBO director who then became Budget Director for Obama (an easy transition), wrote for Bloomberg that he\u2019s worried GOPers won\u2019t pick someone with his statist views.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office should be able to celebrate its 40th anniversary this coming February with pride. \u2026The occasion will be ruined, however, if the new Republican Congress breaks its long tradition of naming an objective economist/policy analyst as CBO director, when the position becomes vacant next year, and instead appoints a party hack.\n\nBy the way, it shows a remarkable lack of self-awareness for someone like Orszag to complain about the possibility of a \u201cparty hack\u201d heading CBO. In any event, that\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. I fully expect we\u2019ll also see editorials very soon from the New York Times, Washington Post, and other statist outlets about the need to preserve the \u201cindependence\u201d of CBO and JCT. Just keep in mind that their real goal is to maintain their side\u2019s control over the process.\n\nBy the way, there\u2019s another Capitol Hill bureaucracy, the Congressional Research Service, that also generates leftist fiscal policy analysis. Fortunately, CRS doesn\u2019t have any scorekeeper or referee role, so it doesn\u2019t cause nearly as much trouble. Nonetheless, any bureaucracy that produces \u201cresearch\u201d about higher taxes being good for the economy needs to be abolished or completely revamped.", "article_metadata": {"item-publish-date": "Mon, 24 Nov 2014 07:20:33 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "The Federalist", "description": "These two \u2018nonpartisan\u2019 bureaucracies strive to raise your taxes and expand entitlements.
