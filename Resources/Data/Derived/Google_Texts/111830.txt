GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. (AP) - Hunters in western Colorado are using darts to manage the fertility of wild horses.

The Little Bookcliffs Wild Horse Area Darting Team shoots mares with darts that deliver a contraceptive that has helped control the size of the herds and earned recognition from the Bureau of Land Management.

Team members have injected 325 doses of fertility drugs since they got together 13 years ago.

According to the Grand Junction Daily Sentinel, the result has been smaller, more manageable wild-horse herds.
