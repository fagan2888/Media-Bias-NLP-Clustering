Wayne Simien, a Leavenworth native who played basketball for the University of Kansas and the Miami Heat, will headline a two-day Christian youth rally in Topeka this weekend.

The Great Plains United Methodist OneEvent is scheduled for Saturday and Sunday at the Capital Plaza Hotel and is expected to draw 1,200 youth from Kansas and Nebraska.

According to a news release, Simien will share his “conversion story” at 7:30 p.m. Saturday.

“He says he ‘stopped doing drugs, stopped drinking, stopped treating women badly and stopped playing selfishly on the court’ as a result of his Christian faith,” the news release stated. “His stats during his senior year at The University of Kansas point to some impressive results.”

Simien averaged 20.3 points and 11.0 rebounds as a senior during the 2004-2005 season for a Jayhawks team that was upset by Bucknell in the opening round of the NCAA Tournament.

As a junior he averaged 17.8 points and 9.3 rebounds for a squad that came within one win of the NCAA Final Four.

He also won an NBA championship in 2006 while playing sparingly for the Miami Heat.

The rally also will include speeches from Stephanie Caro, a youth ministry consultant, and Bishop Richard B. Wilke, a native of El Dorado who was a pastor in the Kansas West United Methodist Conference for 30 years before being elected bishop in 1984.

Live music from Christian rock bands is scheduled.
