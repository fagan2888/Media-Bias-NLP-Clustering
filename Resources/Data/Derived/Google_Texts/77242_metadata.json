Front-wheel drive is the general standard, but all-wheel drive is available, but the F Sport model comes only in the all-wheel version with an eight-speed automatic.\n\nFor safety, the 2015 Lexus RX 350 is well-equipped with anti-lock brakes, stability and traction control, front, rear side, side curtain and front knee airbags, a rear-view camera and the Safety Connect emergency communications system that gives peace of mind by offering automatic collision notification, an emergency assist and stolen vehicle location service. There are also the optional safety add-ons like the blind-spot monitoring system, frontal pre-collision warning and a brake-priming system.\n\nWhile the 2015 Lexus RS 350 looks good on the outside, the interior is just as stunning since after all, Lexus does have a reputation to uphold.

Comfortable, yes; good sound system, indeed; acceleration, no complaints at all; it\u2019s your own little luxurious world and devoid of outside noise too.
