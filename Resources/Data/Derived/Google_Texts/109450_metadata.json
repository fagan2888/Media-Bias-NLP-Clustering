ABC News\n\nWhat if you could see your brainwaves visualized in 3D, manipulating the model in your hand and physically holding the abstract patterns of your mind? New York-based artist Ion Popian is hard at work making that dream a reality.\n\nPopian calls his series \u201cMental Fabrications.\u201d The tiny, tissue box-sized creations are part of a much larger movement in 3D printing, which seeks to explore human anatomy in tactile ways \u2014 freeing anatomical models from the confines of pixelated screens. Popian\u2019s creations are always unique, and direct representations of the user\u2019s own brainwaves.\n\n\u201c[The] emotions, we can feel as human we can map these out,\u201d Popian told ABC News. \u201cEvery single one of these maps is like a fingerprint of the individual.\u201d He achieves these models with help from a portable headset equipped with a biosensor he attaches to his subjects. Popian gives users an abstract film to watch, packed with slow-motion colorful movement to stimulate brain activity.\n\nAs the subject\u2019s brain revels in the film, produced by filmmaker Noah Shulman, other people in the studio can watch the peaks and valleys undulate back and forth on a screen. Each peak represents a moment of relaxation, Popian says, \u201cbecause they\u2019re lighter, more airy.\u201d From there, he sends the data to a 3D printer, where each subtle peak and valley is recorded and coded through a complex algorithm.\n\nWhat comes out is a fully rendered 3D model of the subject\u2019s brainwaves. \u201cThe process of architecture is what I used to derive this whole concept. It\u2019s trying to bring a scientific\u2026process to an art project,\u201d said Popian, who plans on ramping up his 3D modeling to greater magnitudes. He hopes his next series of brainwaves will be large enough to walk around in.\n\nShulman, for his part, said the project was intriguing to work on for what it represents artistically. \u201cFrom watching the film to printing the art it\u2019s almost like art to creativity in its purest form,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s straight from the brain.\u201d\n\nABC US News | ABC Celebrity News", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "new, york, artist, ion, popian, records, brainwaves, and, turns, them, 3d, art, its, purest, form", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "New York-based artist Ion Popian recorded brainwaves and turned them into 3D art.", "title": "See Your Brainwaves Modeled In 3D [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/new-york-artist-ion-popian-records-brainwaves-and-turns-them-3d-art-its-purest-form-288012", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/12/brainwaves.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "New York-based artist Ion Popian recorded brainwaves and turned them into 3D art.", "title": "See Your Brainwaves Modeled In 3D [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/new-york-artist-ion-popian-records-brainwaves-and-turns-them-3d-art-its-purest-form-288012", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/12/brainwaves.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/12/brainwaves.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-06-12T15:05:01-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-12T15:05:00-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "New York-based artist Ion Popian recorded brainwaves and turned them into 3D art."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1106\"", "article_summary": "New York-based artist Ion Popian wants to take your brainwaves and let you hold them in your hands.\nNew York-based artist Ion Popian is hard at work making that dream a reality.\n\u201cFrom watching the film to printing the art it\u2019s almost like art to creativity in its purest form,\u201d he said.\nWhat comes out is a fully rendered 3D model of the subject\u2019s brainwaves.\nIt\u2019s trying to bring a scientific\u2026process to an art project,\u201d said Popian, who plans on ramping up his 3D modeling to greater magnitudes."}
