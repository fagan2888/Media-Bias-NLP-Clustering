On Wednesday, they plan to meet with Gov. Charlie Baker to appeal to him to get the job done. Rail link supporters promote it as a logical solution to long-term congestion problems and a way to avoid other costly upgrades, like the expansion of South Station. But the project is in line behind many others, including mega-projects like the Green Line Extension, a commuter rail spur to the South Coast, and needed maintenance upgrades on the MBTA. And the rail link lives in the haze of the historic Big Dig cost overruns left from the last time the downtown area was dug up to bury the interstate highway.\n\nOther storylines for the week ahead:\n\n-- While they bill themselves as full-time, the House and Senate are in the midst of a weeks-long summer recess and reps and senators are not about to rush back to Beacon Hill the day after Labor Day. A few committees plan to resume business next week but the House and Senate plan to stick with informal sessions.\n\n-- President Barack Obama visits Monday, Labor Day, with plans to address a breakfast put together by employee unions. Obama arrives amid debate around the country over sick leave and parental leave benefits, wage equity, the so-called \"living wage\" for low-income workers and in Massachusetts a new push to impose higher taxes on those who earn more than $1 million per year. New England Police Benevolent Association Executive Director Jerry Flynn said his organization would boycott the breakfast, arguing that Obama has not addressed the recent spate of attacks on police. \"The president of the united states has blood on his hands,\" Flynn told WMEX. He said, \"Where's he been? He's been among the missing.\" The shortened work week closes on Friday, the 14-year anniversary of the terrorist attacks on New York City and Washington D.C.\n\n--Speaker Robert DeLeo plans to be in Springfield on Wednesday and Thursday, though details of his events in the city are still being worked out. Senate President Stanley Rosenberg has events in the Pioneer Valley and in Boston next week.\n\n-- The Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency is promoting through the month of September the creation of personalized emergency preparedness kits and other hazard-avoiding steps that the public can take. Gov. Charlie Baker proclaimed September Emergency Preparedness Month in conjunction with a nationwide preparedness campaign. The month also corresponds roughly with the peak Atlantic hurricane season, the 10-year anniversary of the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina and the start of the school year. MEMA said emergency kits are \"stocked with supplies that will help sustain individuals and families during disasters,\" and also encouraged people to stay informed, develop a plan and be involved in their communities.\n\n-- The annual commemoration of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, wherein planes out of Logan Airport were turned into weapons used to destroy the Twin Towers in New York City, will begin at 7:15 a.m. Friday, and include a ceremony in the House chamber for the Sweeney Award for Civilian Bravery.\n\nSATURDAY, SEPT. 5, 2015\n\nAND THEY'RE OFF: Live horse racing returns to Suffolk Downs on Saturday, with several races featuring locally trained and bred thoroughbreds, as well as local trainers and jockeys.
