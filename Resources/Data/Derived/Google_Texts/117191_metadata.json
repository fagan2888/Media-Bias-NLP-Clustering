Roni credited therapy with saving their marriage.\n\nIn-person therapy isn\u2019t always an accessible or reasonable option for people who need counseling. It can be costly and inconvenient. In some cases, the anxiety of talking about what might be an uncomfortable subject with a stranger in an in-person visit is enough to put people off of seeing a therapist.\n\nFor those reasons, mental health needs may be neglected. But in a technology-driven world where quick-hit messages are the way many people communicate, the option to chat online or text message a therapist, whenever you want, is a reality, if you can afford to pay out-of-pocket for the service.\n\nThe Talkspace app is one of those services that is making therapy much more available with digital, real-time support. In exchange for a weekly $25 fee, for which users are billed monthly, users get unlimited texting service. Video chat options are also available.\n\nNicole Amesbury, LMHC, is one of the more than 200 active therapists working with Talkspace. For her, this format has provided a new opportunity in helping others.\n\n\u201cText-based therapy affords people a different modality. We\u2019re not trying to replace face-to-face therapy,\u201d she says. \u201cBut there\u2019s a variety of people who can\u2019t tolerate or participate in face-to-face treatment, so they need someone to help them. There\u2019s something unique and valuable about the writing experience.\u201d\n\nShe shared a specific example of why this can work better than traditional therapy.\n\n\u201cIf someone was raped and experienced trauma from that, they might have hesitation about going out or being in any similar situation \u2013 a symptom of PTSD. By being able to come online, in your own home in a comfortable space is helpful. If I were to ask them a question, they can take as long as they need to respond to me \u2013 it\u2019s easier to work through trauma that way.\u201d\n\nThis is not a crisis hotline operation.\n\nCustomers work with the same licensed therapist for the duration of their session, but if they\u2019re unsatisfied they can pick another therapist. The idea is that because the new therapist can access the text message string from the previous sessions, they already have the patient\u2019s history, so the transitions are much smoother.\n\nHaving a convenient, anonymous service like Talkspace can be a useful tool for many types of people \u2013 from those who are constantly traveling to even those in the LGBTQ community who haven\u2019t yet felt comfortable to come out publicly.\n\nAs Roni pointed out in an interview, dealing with stigma and shame are a huge part of why people avoid seeing a therapist. With this mobile option, it eliminates that aspect and provides a safer experience for those willing to reach out for help.\n\nDespite the unlimited access patients have to the service, it doesn\u2019t mean that they will always get an instant response. The company provides a way for people to text whatever challenges they are dealing with at a given time. The therapist can then look at what a person wrote and respond accordingly.\n\nRoni noted that this format has multiple beneficial aspects. Not only do people have access to informed, rapid feedback, they also experience the benefits of what could be considered journaling \u2014 a practice many therapists recommend generally.\n\nIn some ways, this methodology resembles some traditional aspects of tending to what\u2019s going in on inside our minds, what might be troubling.\n\n\u201cIf you look way back to confession in the Catholic church, people are not looking directly at each other,\u201d Amesbury says. \u201cPeople want to be heard but they don\u2019t want to feel like they are being interrogated.\u201d\n\nThere are real benefits to be had through sharing our personal stories and working through our challenges. If it\u2019s made easier in a format catered to the modern generations, maybe more people will actually feel heard \u2013 even if it\u2019s through a text message.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Telehealth startup Talkspace provides therapy through its text message application.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "MedCity News", "description": "Telehealth startup Talkspace provides therapy through its text message application.", "title": "If you could get therapy through text messaging instead of an in-person visit, would you be more likely to do it?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Screen-Shot-2015-06-03-at-2.38.55-PM.png", "updated_time": "2015-06-26T10:44:33-04:00", "url": "http://medcitynews.com/2015/06/talkspace-therapy-psychology-mental-health-apps-text-messages/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Screen-Shot-2015-06-03-at-2.38.55-PM.png", "description": "Telehealth startup Talkspace provides therapy through its text message application.", "card": "summary", "title": "If you could get therapy through text messaging instead of an in-person visit, would you be more likely to do it? - MedCity News"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 148725768475669}, "google-site-verification": "xudQg7nxVR9ifmMTY4Tf-0wVtX9b6rWLQd0utCweGOc", "keywords": "weight loss, obesity, overweight,diabetes,massachusetts,medical devices,obesity,startups,healthcare innovation, medcity news,medcity news,san francisco, startups, life sciences,accelerator,rock health,startup advice,startup funding,patient monitoring system, motion sensors ,dc,healthcare it,washington,foodborne pathogens, diagnostics company, diagnostic platforms,minimally invasive surgery, laser surgery,cambridge,dealflow,hospitals,wellpoint, healthways, health and wellness, employee wellness programs,investing,wellness,medtronic, shanghai innovation center, china, r&d,china,mdt,minneapolis,minnesota,publics,twin cities,ulcerative colitis, abbott labs, humira,abbott labs,doctors,pharmaceuticals,skin disorders, pharmaceuticals, md anderson cancer center,cancer,texas,renal denervation, st. jude medical,st. jude medical,stj,emr, ehr, electronic health records, electronic medical records, certified emr,certified emr,ehr,electronic health records,electronic medical records,advanced cellular technology,amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,embryonic stem cells,geron corporation,lou gehrig\\'s disease,macular degeneration,regenerative medicine,spinal cord damage,value-based healthcare system, obamacare, fee-for-service model,california,cleveland,health insurance,insurance,ohio,pennsylvania,politics,cancer treatment options library, aetna, aet, healthcare it,aet,aetna,health it,phi,philadelphia,digital health, Mental Health, New York, New York City, Roni Frank, Talkspace, telepsychology, , MedCity News", "article": {"section": "Daily", "tag": "telepsychology", "published_time": "2015-06-03T14:58:59-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-26T10:44:33-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,width=device-width,user-scalable=no,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1e76\"", "article_summary": "In-person therapy isn\u2019t always an accessible or reasonable option for people who need counseling.\nIf people could text their therapist when they need them from their own home, would that make people more likely to use a therapist and use them more often?\nThe Talkspace app is one of those services that is making therapy much more available with digital, real-time support.\nThe company provides a way for people to text whatever challenges they are dealing with at a given time.\nThere\u2019s something unique and valuable about the writing experience.\u201dShe shared a specific example of why this can work better than traditional therapy."}
