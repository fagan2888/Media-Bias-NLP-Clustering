A man with Tulsa ties is on the loose after escaping from an Oklahoma City correctional facility. Carl J. Fisher escaped from the Clara Waters Community Correctional Facility on December 21, 2015.

Prison officials say a guard did a bunk check at 11 p.m. that night and discovered him missing. They searched for Fisher, but so far he hasn't been located.

He was serving three years for drug possession. Fisher has a criminal history that includes convictions for car theft, concealing stolen property and escape from confinement - as well as several additional drug charges.

Fisher is 33 years old, 6 feet tall and 165 pounds with brown hair and green eyes.

If you see Fisher or know where he is, call local law enforcement or the Fugitive Warrants Division at 866-363-1119.
