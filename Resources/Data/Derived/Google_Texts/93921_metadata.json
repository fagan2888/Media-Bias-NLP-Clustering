Stewart referred to the topics covered in the interview as a \"scandal grab bag.\"\n\nO' Reilly said those issues aren't important to the president or Stewart because they \"don't pertain to social justice or global warming.\"\n\n\"So, if I ask about those issues I'm a doofus, a scandal monger,\" O'Reilly said in a segment Wednesday night entitled, \"Making Jon Stewart understand America.\"\n\n\"The American people are being forced to accept Obamacare and right now, despite billions of dollars spent, it's still chaotic.\" O'Reilly asserted. \"I believe that might be an important issue. Are you hearing me out there in left-wing fantasy land? Good grief.\"\n\nBoth Stewart and O'Reilly have appeared on each other\u2019s shows before. The last time Stewart was on the \"The O'Reilly Factor\" just over a year ago, he referred to O'Reilly as FOX News' voice of sanity, though Stewart said that's like being \"the thinnest kid at fat camp.\"", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "barack-obama, lawrence-mercer-county, politics, news", "title": "Bill O'Reilly to Jon Stewart: 'Are you hearing me out there in left-wing fantasy land?'
