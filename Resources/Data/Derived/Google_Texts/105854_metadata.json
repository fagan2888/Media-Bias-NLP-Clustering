ProPublica reported that Cassel received about $235,000 in compensation and stock as a board member for Premier in 2013, and $189,000 as a board member for Kaiser in 2012.\n\nThe National Union of Healthcare Workers, whose members include 5,000 Kaiser employees in California, said it welcomed Cassel's move.\n\n\"This is a victory for patients and caregivers and a victory for transparency in the top echelons of the healthcare industry,\" Sal Rosselli, president of NUHW, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe National Quality Forum plays a huge role in our hospitals by defining the \u2018best practices\u2019 that our caregivers use. Healthcare workers and patients need to be certain that money from giant HMOs like Kaiser isn't corrupting NQF's decision-making process.\u201d\n\nALSO:\n\nObamacare enrollees hit roadblocks at doctors' offices\n\nAffordable Care Act will prompt some to work less, report says\n\nCalifornia health exchange pulls error-ridden physician list--again\n\nTwitter: @skarlamangla\n\nsoumya.karlamangla@latimes.com", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Kaiser Permanente board member quits amid questions over conflicts", "Description": "A board member of healthcare giant Kaiser Permanente has stepped down amid questions over a possible conflict of interest involving her role at a leading medical organization.
