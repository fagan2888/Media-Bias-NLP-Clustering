But Obama was clearly upset, berating the heckler during his speech.\n\nDuring his speech at the Betty Ann Ong Chinese Recreation Center in San Francisco, the President was interrupted by a young man shouting about how families were being split up by deportation. He called on Obama to stop the deportations.\n\n\u201cMr. President, please use your executive order to halt deportation\u2026\u201d the young man yelled. \u201cWe agree that we need to pass comprehensive immigration reform. At the same time, you have a power to stop deportation\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cActually, I don\u2019t,\u201d Obama snapped in response.\n\nSome members of the crowd tried unsuccessfully to block the man\u2019s outburst by chanting \u201cObama! Obama!\u201d as the President attempted to ignore the interruption and keep going. But the heckler continued, shouting \u201cStop deportation! Stop deportation!\u201d Members of the security team moved in to remove the heckler, but POTUS told them to let him stay.\n\nAfter expressing his understanding of the young man\u2019s passion, Obama then unleashed on him, turning to face the audience behind him.\n\nThe President condescendingly explained that if he could bypass Congress to achieve immigration reform, he would, but stressed that the United States is \u201ca nation of laws.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd so, the easy way out is to try to yell and pretend like I can do something by violating our laws,\u201d he criticized. \u201cAnd what I\u2019m proposing is the harder path, which is to use our democratic processes to achieve the same goal that you want to achieve.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut it won\u2019t be as easy as just shouting,\u201d he chastised.\n\nWatch the interaction below:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "President Barack Obama was heckled from an unusual source during his immigration speech on Monday -- a man among the group of people hand-selected to stand right behind POTUS on stage.
