Obamacare will be gone.\n\nWhat's the big fuss about Planned Parenthood?\n\nEvolving from the United States' first birth clinic in Brooklyn, NY, in 1921, Planned Parenthood has become the most important women's health organization in the country.\n\nIn 2013, Planned Parenthood clinics cared for 2.7 million patients, with 79 percent having incomes at or below 150 percent of the federal poverty line.\n\nThe most controversial of its services, abortion (3 percent of Planned Parenthood's total services) is often cited as a reason for the defunding.\n\nHowever, following the cascade of legislation from Roe v. Wade, the Hyde Amendment \u2014 initially established in 1976 \u2014 strictly prohibits the use of federal funding for abortions (unless the pregnancy is caused by incest or rape, or threatens the life of the mother).\n\nThus, this objection should be left as a non-issue.\n\nWhat does Planned Parenthood offer? How often are these services used?*\n\n\u2013 Breast and cervical cancer screening, including Pap smears (900,000 in 2013)\n\n\u2013 Sexually transmitted infection (STI/STD) testing and treatment (4.5 million in 2013)\n\n\u2013 Pregnancy tests (1 million in 2013)\n\n\u2013 Prenatal care for expectant mothers (18,684 in 2013)\n\n\u2013 Contraceptives (3.7 million in 2013)\n\n\u2013 Sex education (1.5 million per year)\n\n\u2013 Vasectomies (4,166 in 2013)\n\n\u2013 Abortions (327,653 in 2013)\n\n\u2013 LGBT services\n\n*Values are from 2013 study.\n\nSo, why should Millennials care?\n\nLet's face it: Many Millennials are financially struggling.\n\nThe US Census Bureau finds that one in five Millennials live in poverty, up from one in seven in the 1980s.\n\nAccording to the Department of Labor and EPI (Economic Policy Institute) reports, over 35 percent of Millennials are unemployed, and 18.3 percent of recent college graduates are underemployed (up from 9.9 percent in 2007).\n\nTaking all this into account, healthcare is usually the last of our priorities when pay day comes around.\n\nAfter rent, food and loans, there is a paltry amount left for other spending.\n\nIn fact, a 2015 study by PNC Healthcare found that 54 percent of Millennials forgo or delay medical care and treatment because of the costs (compared to 37 percent of the Baby Boomers).\n\nFurther compounding these values, women earn an average of $.79 for every dollar earned by their male counterparts.\n\nLet's add some medical expertise into the discussion.\n\nThe CDC estimates that there are 19.7 million new cases of STIs in the US yearly, with a total prevalence of over 110 million.\n\nThis directly costs us $15.6 billion per annum.\n\nAdditionally, one in two sexually active individuals will contract an STI by age 25.\n\nHowever, a survey of American physicians found that less than a third of patients routinely screen for STIs.\n\nThese are only the ones who show up to doctor's appointments.\n\nRemember the over 50 percent of Millennials who don't?\n\nScreening for breast and cervical cancer saves lives.\n\nThe National Cancer Institute has found the five-year survival of patients suffering from localized cervical cancer has jumped to 91.5 percent.\n\nThis jump has been largely attributed to increased, earlier screening and thus, treatment.\n\nPrenatal care for expectant mothers is undoubtedly essential for the well-being of the child and mother.\n\nPlanned Parenthood offers regular checkups, screenings for the baby and mother, ultrasounds, amnios or genetic testing and, most importantly, counseling.\n\nStudies note an increase of 40 percent in neonatal death from mothers without prenatal care.\n\nThe Guttmacher Institute found that publicly funded family planning avoided 2 million unintended pregnancies in 2013.\n\nWithout these services, unplanned births and abortion rates would have been 66 percent higher.\n\nSo, at the end of the day, being pro-life or pro-choice shouldn't matter.\n\nPlanned Parenthood is undoubtedly at the vanguard of promoting women's health.\n\nAs Millennials, we have a responsibility toward our future and our health.\n\nLet's not let politics get in the way of that.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It's time to pay attention.", "og": {"site_name": "Elite
