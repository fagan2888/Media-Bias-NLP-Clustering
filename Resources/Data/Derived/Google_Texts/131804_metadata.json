The location makes it possible for residents across Southern California to be seen by a health professional, Chrystal said.\n\nResidents from as far away as Riverside and even Indio have contacted the organization seeking information in order to attend the clinic.\n\nGenerally, the clinic draws everyone from the homeless to parents with children.\n\n\u201cIt literally runs the gamut,\u201d Chrystal said. \u201cWe don\u2019t ask questions. We just want to help them.\u201d\n\nThe Affordable Care Act his made it possible for many to enroll in health insurance programs, Chrystal said, but some people still don\u2019t have access to dental care or other services and can\u2019t afford them.\n\nThe clinic is made possible with the support of Focusing Philanthropy, a Los Angeles-based organization that screens non-profit groups that interested donors contribute to.\n\nOrganization representatives were present at a clinic California CareForce organized in Coachella recently and some others and walked away impressed with the work being done, said Elliott Gilson, president of Focusing Philanthropy.\n\nSo the organization asked its donors for help funding this weekend\u2019s clinic and they responded, he said.\n\nFairplex was selected as the site for several reasons, one being need.\n\n\u201cIt was placed out there because that whole area is under served\u201d when it comes to health services, Gilson said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOther groups have organized clinics in Los Angeles or communities to the west but not in the eastern end of Los Angeles County.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to have one in a slightly different geographic area,\u201d Gilson said.\n\nThose at the clinic who need follow-up care will be referred to one of several free or-low cost clinics, such as the Pomona Community Health Center.\n\nThe center will have representatives at the clinic to assist those with and without health insurance and will assist those without coverage to figure out what plans they qualify for, said Carmen Muniz, chief operations officer at the center.\n\nEvery day 300 to 500 volunteers will work at the clinic but additional dentists, licensed vocational nurses, licensed practical nurses and optometrists are still sought.\n\nThose interested in volunteering may go to www.californiacareforce.org, then click on volunteers, then go to Fairplex one, two or all three days of the clinic in the morning.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to bring anything. Just bring yourself,\u201d said Kathryn Quanstrom, a San Bernardino resident who is assisting with volunteer registration.\n\nPhysicians interested in volunteering should also register through the website and bring their stethoscopes and prescription pads, Chrystal said.\n\nPatients will be able to receive care in two of three areas \u2014 medical, dental or vision, Chrystal said.\n\nPatients can park at Gate 9 on the east side of White Avenue and line up at that gate. Tickets to enter the clinic will be issued between 3 and 3:30 each morning. Beginning at 5:30 a.m.,. small groups of patients will begin entering the clinic area for registration and will start being seen by health-care professionals at 6 a.m.\n\nA limited number of tickets will be issued each morning. Patients must be present when their ticket number is called.\n\nAdditional patient information is available by going to www.californiacareforce.org/Patients/PatientInformation.aspx.\n\nDetails on how to prepare for the day are spelled out on the website.\n\nPeople can stay in the parking lot if they do not want to leave Fairplex after being issued a ticket, according to a Fairplex spokeswoman.", "article_metadata": {"description": "POMONA >> Hundreds of health care professionals will be at Fairplex for three days starting Friday  morning to provide free health services to thousands of people as part of a three-day clinic organized by", "title": "Free health care to be offered for three days at Fairplex in Pomona", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailybulletin.com/health/20150709/free-health-care-to-be-offered-for-three-days-at-fairplex-in-pomona", "image": {"width": "1500px", "identifier": "http://www.dailybulletin.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LF/20150709/NEWS/150709458/AR/0/AR-150709458.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "1125px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Free health care to be offered for three days at Fairplex in Pomona"}, "twitter": {"domain": "dailybulletin.com", "description": "POMONA >> Hundreds of health care professionals will be at Fairplex for three days starting Friday  morning to provide free health services to thousands of people as part of a three-day clinic organized by", "title": "Free health care to be offered for three days at Fairplex in Pomona", "url": "http://www.dailybulletin.com/health/20150709/free-health-care-to-be-offered-for-three-days-at-fairplex-in-pomona", "image": {"src": "http://www.dailybulletin.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LF/20150709/NEWS/150709458/AR/0/AR-150709458.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@ivdailybulletin", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id551776550", "iphone": "id503648014", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.inlandvalleydailybulletin"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "keywords": "California CareForce,Fairplex,Pomona, Health", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "California CareForce,Fairplex,Pomona, Health"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe06ff\"", "article_summary": "POMONA >> Hundreds of health care professionals will be at Fairplex for three days starting Friday morning to provide free health services to thousands of people as part of a three-day clinic organized by California CareForce.\n\u201cIt was placed out there because that whole area is under served\u201d when it comes to health services, Gilson said.\nNeither identification nor insurance are to receive care, Chrystal said.\nPatients will be able to receive care in two of three areas \u2014 medical, dental or vision, Chrystal said.\nThose at the clinic who need follow-up care will be referred to one of several free or-low cost clinics, such as the Pomona Community Health Center."}
