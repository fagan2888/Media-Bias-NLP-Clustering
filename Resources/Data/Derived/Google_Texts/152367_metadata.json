How bad is it?\n\nIt\u2019s so bad even a \u201csafe\u201d Republican like Congressman Darrell Issa\u2019s numbers have tanked. You know it\u2019s bad when the local Democratic Party sends out fundraising emails talking about unseating Brian Bilbray in the last election and saying Issa\u2019s next.\n\nA Public Policy Polling (PPP) survey of 650 voters in the 49th Congressional district taken October 15 & 16 shows Rep. Issa with a 49-43 disapproval margin (9% undecided). For the first time ever, voters preferred a generic Democratic opponent in a theoretical match up, if only by 1%, well within the margin of error. And his constituents opposed the GOP\u2019s \u201cshut \u2018er down\u201d strategy by 62-32%.\n\nOf course Congressman Issa\u2019s so invincible that nobody would dare run against him, right? After all, he\u2019d probably convene hearings and issue subpoenas leading nowhere, like he\u2019s done on the IRS and Benghazi. Currently Issa\u2019s even trying to figure out why the government shut down in early October.\n\nToday\u2019s Voice of San Diego Morning Report mentions a UT-San Diego story saying Issa has already raised $2.7 million for his re-election effort. And writer Randy Dotinga says it\u2019s \u201cfunny\u201d as he buys into the UT line o\u2019 crap saying Issa has no opponent.\n\nThat\u2019s not true. Democrat Dave Peiser declared months ago and is raising money through the Act Blue web site. He\u2019s even been written up repeatedly at the progressive Dem site, Daily Kos, so it\u2019s not like Peiser\u2019s in hiding.\n\nI\u2019m just saying that\u2019s how bad the Republicans have screwed up. And if they keep up the \u201cgood work\u201d by blocking immigration reform and cutting Social Security, who knows?\n\nI\u2019m not saying Issa\u2019s beatable. I\u2019m not saying Peiser\u2019s a credible candidate. Yet.\n\nUPDATE: UT story now includes mention of Peiser:\n\nIssa\u2019s tenure as chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee ends in 2014 and he has not announced whether he will seek an eighth term. But if he does, he has more than $2.7 million in his campaign account to help stave off any challengers, such as Encinitas Democrat Dave Peiser, who says he intends to challenge Issa next year.\n\nThe 52-year-old Peiser owns an information technology consulting firm and plans to make an official announcement of his first-ever political office candidacy with the next two weeks.\n\n\u201cI feel I am a compelling candidate with a lot of deep connections in the community and I don\u2019t feel that he really represents the interests of our district,\u201d Peiser said.\n\nOn the National Scene\n\nLooking beyond the PPP poll, there are two other polls worth noting.\n\nVia Mother Jones:\n\nToday\u2019s ABC/Washington Post poll is the worst horror show yet for the Republican Party. Of the respondents:\n\n81 percent disapprove of the government shutdown.\n\n53 percent think Republicans are solely to blame (compared to only 29 percent blaming Obama).\n\n77 percent believe that Republicans only care about doing what\u2019s best for themselves, not what\u2019s best for the country.\n\nThen there\u2019s the USA Today/ Princeton Survey Research Poll. A mere 4% of the 1001 adults surveyed over the weekend say Congress would be changed for the worse if nearly every member was replaced next year.\n\nIn the aftermath of the shutdown, though, Republicans clearly are bearing the brunt of the blame. By 2-to-1, 39%-19%, those surveyed say Republicans deserve more blame, not Democrats. Thirty-six percent say the two parties share the blame equally.\n\nEven Republicans, presumably inclined to blame the other side, are divided about whether responsibility belongs to the Democrats are to both parties equally. That\u2019s not true among Democrats: Eight in 10 say the GOP is largely to blame.\n\nDemocrats by 2-1, 22%-11%, have a more favorable opinion of their party in the aftermath of the shutdown.\n\nThe ObamaCare Website Blues\n\nThe President went on TV yesterday to tell everybody he\u2019s angry about the problems with the Fed\u2019s website that serves as a portal to insurance options under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe UT-San Diego gave nearly all of its \u201cover the fold\u201d front page today to graphic calling attention to the problems at HealthCare.gov. And if you read their nearly daily sermons, you\u2019d think the end of the world was coming\u2014this from an organization that runs a horribly dysfunctional internet site that freezes regularly, can\u2019t search worth a damn and obviously has nobody supervising.\n\nNo doubt about it\u2013 there are issues with signing up for ObamaCare. Just how bad they are is just a matter of who\u2019s telling the story. And, as is true with the actual health insurance coverage at the end of that bumpy internet experience, there\u2019s mucho spin coming from the people who want to preserve the current system.\n\nAfter all, dying from breast cancer due to lack of health insurance caused by \u201cpre-existing condition\u201d corporate policies can\u2019t possibly be worse than a bad internet experience.\n\nReality vs. Hyped Horror Stories\n\nThe Pew Research Center surveyed Americans about signing up for health insurance this month and found, while there are generally negative impressions of the website comparable to what\u2019s being reported in the news media, 56% of those who\u2019d actually used it \u201csay they personally found the site to be very or fairly easy to use\u201d.\n\nThen there are the horror stories, and there\u2019s no better place than Fox News to find them. Sean Hannity had six people on his show recently to share their tales of woe about \u201cthe pain of Obamacare and the healthcare overhaul train wreck.\u201d\n\nViewers saw and heard about canceled policies, premium hikes, restrictions on the freedom to see a doctor of their choice, financial burdens upon their small businesses and so on.\n\nEric Stern smelled a rat. As a former senior advisor to Montana\u2019s Gov. Brian Schweitzer the stories didn\u2019t match up with the facts as Stern had learned them about the Affordable Care Act. He tracked down Hannity\u2019s guests and asked a few simple questions.\n\nAs he tells the story at Salon.com, none of those \u201cvictims\u201d had even shopped for insurance. The whole Hannity episode was complete and utter crap. Read the article.\n\nA Real Life Story\n\nAnother Fox news contributor did go to a government web site to sign up for insurance, and didn\u2019t get the results her editors no doubt expected. Freelancer Sally Kohn went to the New York state exchange website and encountered the much ballyhooed glitches\u2026\n\nBUT she found fifty plans with lower costs and better coverage than her current plan. And ten plans with a higher premium than her current insurance, but with lower deductibles.\n\nHer total time spent was four hours. She saved $5400 in premiums and deductables for next year and got better coverage out of the deal.\n\nThe Politics Behind the Web Site\n\nNPR reporter Julie Rovner looked into the back story on the development of the federal government\u2019s website. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be too surprised at what she found.\n\nSince the Affordable Care Act\u2019s health care exchanges launched to a long series of error messages Oct. 1, most of the \u201cwhat went wrong\u201d fingers have been pointing at software developers.\n\nBut some say there\u2019s more to it than that \u2014 that politics has played a role as well.\n\n\u201cIt is a mess and there\u2019s no sugarcoating it, and people shouldn\u2019t sugarcoat that,\u201d says Jay Angoff, who formerly ran the health exchange program for the Department of Health and Human Services. \u201cOn the other hand, people should remember that those who are in charge of the money HHS needs to implement the federal exchange are dedicated to the destruction of the federal exchange, and the destruction of the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of Crashing Web Sites\u2026\n\nThose of us that have kids getting ready to make the big leap to college can take small comfort in knowing that it\u2019s not just the feds who are having a problem with web-based sign up sites.\n\nFrom The Washington Post:\n\nA cascade of glitches in a major online college application program has frustrated prospective students across the country and prompted several universities to push back their fall deadlines, exposing vulnerabilities in the nation\u2019s college admissions system.\n\nMore than 515 colleges and universities, including the entire Ivy League and public flagships such as the University of Virginia, use the Common Application to help choose their incoming classes. The program, which handles millions of applications annually, was retooled this year in an attempt to make an inherently stressful teenage ritual a little easier. But the fourth online version of the Common App, which went live Aug. 1, has compounded the angst of many college-bound students.\n\nSoftware troubles and other technical difficulties have left students staring at frozen screens or led them to pay multiple fees for a single application. Others reported being shut out of their accounts entirely.\n\nPapa Doug Manchester\u2019s Reader? Not!\n\nCity Beat\u2019s Kelly Davis posted a story yesterday about an offer by higher ups at the UT-San Diego to buy the San Diego Reader.\n\nShe starts out by quoting an email from CEO John Lynch to staffers in Mission Valley:\n\nApparently, rumors are rampant that the UT is acquiring the Reader. Although there has been communication between the two ownerships, there is no transaction complete or forthcoming with the Reader.\n\nThis all started with an email exchange between Lynch and Reader publisher Jim Holman triggered by Don Bauder\u2019s Aug. 21 story, \u201cPapa Doug Manchester picks Siberian bride-to-be.\u201d (Tee-hee, read the story!)\n\nDavis emailed Holman. Here\u2019s her account:\n\n\u201cAfter the story went online there was a lively exchange of email between John Lynch and me about Don\u2019s story,\u201d Holman wrote, \u201cincluding what I interpreted as a threat.\u201d\n\nYikes.\n\nA week later, Lynch emailed Holman again, this time asking about buying the Reader.\n\n\u201cI responded that I was not interested,\u201d Holman said.\n\nCaring About North Park\n\nThe people behind the opposition to notorious Jack-in-the-Box\u2019s project at 30th and Upas are going one step further. In addition to a lawsuit winding its way through the courts, they\u2019re coming together to work on a new kind of community alliance with one focus: empowering neighborhoods to demand that land use laws be enforced.\n\nThey\u2019ve launched the Care About North Park website to keep people informed and have reached out to connect with a citizens group called Care About Clairemont. The group says they\u2019re \u201ceager to collaborate with other San Diegans who want our city government to uphold its laws and respect its communities.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the video they produced explaining in simple language what got them started on the road to community activism:\n\nOn This Day: 1844 \u2013 This day is recognized as \u201cThe Great Disappointment\u201d among those who practiced Millerism. The world was expected to come to an end according to the followers of William Miller. 1961 \u2013 Chubby Checker appeared on the \u201cEd Sullivan Show\u201d and performed \u201cThe Twist.\u201d 1975 \u2013 Air Force Technical Sergeant Leonard Matlovich was discharged after publicly declaring his homosexuality. His tombstone reads \u201d \u201cA gay Vietnam Veteran. When I was in the military they gave me a medal for killing two men and a discharge for loving one.\u201d\n\nDid you enjoy this article?
