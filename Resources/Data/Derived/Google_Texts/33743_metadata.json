She also makes some of her own by gluing on embellishments like wreaths and tinsel.\n\nMs. Reitmeyer is part of a growing group of what you\u2019d call sweater-preneurs. They are those who get their jollies by adding some fashion follies to people\u2019s holidays through designing ornate sweaters or reselling vintage ones. Some other good local go-tos for holiday gear include A Child\u2019s Wardrobe & Adults Too in Squirrel Hill, Highway Robbery vintage shop on the South Side and consignment stores.\n\nAnd the demand for these wacky wardrobe staples this time of year is going strong.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something fun about not taking yourself too seriously,\u201d says Jared Sullivan, chair of the Young Executive Council at the Rivers Club, Downtown. For the group\u2019s holiday get-together, it opted for a \u201cmerry-oke\u201d sweater party, complete with karaoke and, of course, quirky clothes. Some of the standouts: a gnome get-up that read \u201ctake me gnome tonight,\u201d gingerbread men with their limbs broken off exclaiming \u201coh snap!\u201d and some homemade creations with ornaments and candy canes stuck on them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like the second coming of Halloween,\u201d says Brian Miller, co-owner of Crow Point, Ind.-based UglyChristmasSweaterParty.com. \u201cThis is kind of an excuse to just have fun and be goofy.\u201d\n\nThe website started in 2005 as a blog that listed where ugly holiday sweater parties would be held and what people wore to them. Interest started to build, particularly when it came to where to find such gaudy gems. Like Ms. Reitmeyer, Mr. Miller and some friends found their local thrift store to be a treasure trove for seasonal sweaters seeking a new home. They sell these thrift store discoveries on their site, as well as new lines of holiday sweaters some mainstream brands have been churning out. This year Mr. Miller expects the site to sell 10,000 sweaters.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been incredibly successful,\u201d he says. A few years ago a literary agent approached Mr. Miller and his team about turning some of their website\u2019s content into an ugly Christmas sweater party book, which was published by Abrams and attracted the attention of \u201cThe Tonight Show With Jay Leno.\u201d\n\nOthers are not only using the silly sweaters to share humor but also to help others. Organizers of National Ugly Christmas Sweater Day \u2014 held annually on the second Friday of December \u2014 teamed this year with Save the Children\u2019s Make the World Better With a Sweater campaign. People were encouraged to wear their favorite holiday sweater, spread the word about the cause and make a $5 donation at savethechildren.org. The day was sponsored by Tipsy Elves, a brand that designs whimsical (and some naughty) holiday sweaters that was featured last year on the ABC television show \u201cShark Tank.\u201d\n\nBut no matter the reason that someone slips one on, it\u2019s just another way to channel the spirit of the season, says Wesley Flippo, National Ugly Christmas Sweater Day co-founder.\n\nIt\u2019s about \u201cputting people in their worst to bring out their best.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The demand for festively ugly fashions has resulted in unique parties devoted to them and more retailers that specialize in selling them.", "og": {"site_name": "Pittsburgh Post-Gazette", "description": "For thrift store enthusiast Leah Reitmeyer of North Versailles, there\u2019s nothing quite like uncovering a truly ugly, soaked in sequins, can\u2019t-help-but-stare holiday sweater. \u201cI would see all kinds of sweaters that I really thought were funny,\u201d she says.\u00a0\u201cI wanted to buy them but had no reason to buy them.\u201d But she bought them anyhow and decided to sell them.
