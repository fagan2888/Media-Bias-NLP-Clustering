Fort Morgan again will transform into the Christmas Capital of the Plains in coming weeks. On Tuesday night, the Fort Morgan City Council heard about the plans for this year's campaign. \"This will be our third year as the Christmas Capital of the Plains, and we're really excited,\" Fort Morgan City Manager Jeff Wells said. \"I think there's a good list of activities that people will be more than happy to come downtown and be involved in.\" During the campaign, the city, local media outlets, businesses and community organizations sponsor various events and activities. The idea is to draw people downtown for the events and maybe a little holiday shopping, too. \"I think most that have participated in or driven down Main Street during the holidays kind of enjoy what it has turned out to become,\" Fort Morgan Community Services Director Josh Miller said. One thing that will be different this year is that there will be a lot more lights, with the ones the city puts up on Main Street stretching from Riverview Avenue to Railroad Avenue, Miller said. \"All of Main Street will be wrapped in lights this year, similar to what we had done through the heart of downtown last year,\" he said. Like with the last two years, city residents should expect some street closures downtown for events on Thursday evenings and Saturdays, Miller said. And the city is adding a big, new event this year: golfing in City Park on Dec. 13. \"We will have a golf course and a driving range set up in City Park,\" Miller said. \"I don't want to give too much away because we want to draw people down to try to figure out how we can golf in City Park.\" However, he did offer up a couple details: \"There will be a big blowup Golfzilla, and kind of a whack-a-mole target and a variety of things to hopefully bring people downtown.\" Wayne Johnson, with MediaLogic Radio, also spoke to the council about Christmas Capital of the Plains plans. \"We're bringing in some, trying to bring in more activities and people into the downtown area,\" he said. \"So far, I think we've been pretty successful with it, so I'm excited about where it's at and where it's going.\" Johnson announced that there would be a campaign kick-off party Nov. 21 at Furniture Mart. The start time for this was still to be determined. \"I think it's a great opportunity to learn more and see some of the enthusiasm that's involved in that,\" Johnson said. He also mentioned the series of free movies on Saturdays at the Cover Theater, with the first one happening the weekend right after Thanksgiving. There will be one more of these than in previous years. \"We had enough sponsors to pay for extra week,\" Johnson said. \"We've had a lot of people step up and get excited about being involved in this. I think it's really good for our city.\" On Thursday nights, there will be special themed shopping nights downtown with giveaways and events, Johnson said. And on Dec. 6, MediaLogic Radio and the Fort Morgan Times will sponsor an Artificial Christmas Tree-Decorating Competition. \"It's going to be a hoot,\" Johnson said, challenging the council members and city staff to form teams and get involved in the competition, as well as other Christmas Capital events. Councilwoman Lisa Northrup said they would accept that challenge. A couple of the favorite Christmas Capital competitive events from the previous years will return: Ice Sculpting and the Rotary Club's Chili Cook-Off. \"That's become pretty competitive with some of the major corporations,\" Johnson said of the Ice Sculpting contest. And with the chili, the question is if Wells will be able to get a three-peat. \"Mr. Wells is a two-time defending champion,\" Johnson pointed out. \"You win three in a row, I think he needs to serve chili to you every week.\" Other fun things to bring people downtown on Thursdays and Saturdays are a Santa House, which will be set up where the Dinky Train used to be on the southwest corner of City Park, as well as horse-drawn carriage rides on Saturday afternoons. Viaero Wireless is sponsoring the Santa House, which will have Santa available to hear kids' Christmas wishes on Thursdays and Saturdays. \"Welcome to the Christmas Capital of the Plains,\" Johnson said. \"Come down every Thursday and Saturday.\" \"It sounds exciting,\" Councilman Damon Mussman said. While not formally a part of the Christmas Capital of the Plains campaign, there also will be the traditional Parade of Lights. Wells announced that this would be held the Monday night after Thanksgiving, Dec. 1. \"We'll be looking at potentially lighting the downtown at that point,\" he said, adding that it was the city's tradition. \"At the same time as the parade, we light up the trees and the downtown area.\" More information about the parade would be forth-coming from the Fort Morgan Chamber of Commerce and the city, Wells said.
