Freshman Coleman Key, opening with the Gold and the second offense before getting some snaps with the presumptive starters, was 17-of-36 for 337 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nThe bad news?\n\nWith new coach Mike Bobo\u2019s push-the-place no-huddle offense on display, the Green and Gold offenses had little trouble moving against the CSU defense, especially through the air, even with All-American receiver Rashard Higgins held out because of a minor hamstring issue. The Green ended up winning 38-34.\n\nWATCH: CSU\u2019s Mike Bobo on Colorado State spring scrimmage and Rams next quarterback\n\n\u201cThe guys competed and it was good to see us make some plays down the field, a lot of explosive plays,\u201d Bobo said. \u201cThe defense played OK in spots during the game, but we have to do a better job at (not) giving up explosive plays. Other than that, the guys competed, played hard and it was a good, competitive game and that\u2019s what I wanted.\u201d\n\nBobo said Stevens \u201cdid a nice job. He knew where he was going the whole game. He missed a couple, but that\u2019s going to happen, and I thought he was a lot more decisive in his throws today.\u201d And Key? \u201cColeman made some big plays as well,\u201d Bobo said. \u201cIf we can get his eyes in the right spot, he\u2019s got a chance to be a very good player as well.\u201d\n\nStevens threw 25 passes as Garrett Grayson\u2019s backup last season.\n\n\u201cI felt pretty good about the scrimmage,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cI thought I could have made a couple of better throws, but for the most part, I had a lot of completions for a lot of yards, as far as I have heard. \u2026 I feel like the last few weeks, it\u2019s been a learning curve that we all handled pretty well.\u201d\n\nKey, who redshirted last season, has the strongest arm among the quarterbacks, and that perhaps even was true a year ago with Grayson \u2014 likely to be a second-day choice (rounds 2-3) in the upcoming NFL draft \u2014 around. Key said of Bobo\u2019s offensive approach: \u201cEspecially with me being young, it\u2019s taken me a while to become comfortable with it, but I think I\u2019ve come a long way since the beginning of spring ball to get the concepts down and learning the system. \u2026 The first week or so, the first couple of days, things were moving so fast, I wasn\u2019t sure what I was looking for, and now things are starting to slow down. I know what I\u2019m doing. Fall camp is going to be a big test for me.\u201d\n\nTreyous Jarrells, seeking to succeed Dee Hart as the Rams\u2019 featured back, ran for 50 yards on 12 carries for the Green, but otherwise there wasn\u2019t much evidence of Bobo\u2019s goal to have the sort of balanced approach he oversaw as Georgia\u2019s offensive coordinator.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just trying to hide all our runs,\u201d Bobo said dryly. \u201cNo, what they do defensively kind of limits some things and we wanted to work the quarterbacks, really in all three scrimmages, and kind of see what we have and where we stand and evaluate those guys. And we\u2019re a little banged up at running back.\u201d\n\nTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost.com or twitter.com/TFrei", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Rams quarterbacks shine in Colorado State\u2019s Green and Gold spring game", "title": "Rams quarterbacks shine in Colorado State\u2019s Green and Gold spring game", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/04/18/rams-quarterbacks-shine-in-colorado-states-green-and-gold-spring-game/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150418__CSU-SPRING-GAME-2p1.jpg", "height": 447}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150418__CSU-SPRING-GAME-2p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-18T15:26:48+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-25T11:51:02+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Colorado State University"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdb9a\"", "article_summary": "WATCH: CSU\u2019s Mike Bobo on Colorado State spring scrimmage and Rams next quarterback\u201cThe guys competed and it was good to see us make some plays down the field, a lot of explosive plays,\u201d Bobo said.\nSophomore Nick Stevens, starting out with the Green and the first offense before some late-game shuffling, was 27-for-41 for 438 yards and four touchdowns.\nOther than that, the guys competed, played hard and it was a good, competitive game and that\u2019s what I wanted.\u201dBobo said Stevens \u201cdid a nice job.\n\u201cThe defense played OK in spots during the game, but we have to do a better job at (not) giving up explosive plays.\nFreshman Coleman Key, opening with the Gold and the second offense before getting some snaps with the presumptive starters, was 17-of-36 for 337 yards and two touchdowns."}
