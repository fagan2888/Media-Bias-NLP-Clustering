Three Kansas cities made a list of the 100 “best places to live” in the country, although Topeka wasn’t among them.

Overland Park ranked 17th, Manhattan was 70th and Lawrence was 74th on a list of the best cities compiled by Livability.com, a website that examines small and medium-sized cities in the United States. The rankings looked at more than 2,000 cities, so any city that made the top 100 was in the top 5 percent of pleasant places to live — at least according to some people’s taste.

The rankings are based on amenities such as farmers markets, golf courses and parks; having a moderate climate; varied terrain and access to water, which can make for better views; arts and cultural offerings; population diversity; income equality; school quality; average educational attainment; resident health, based on adult obesity rates, low birthweight babies and the number of doctors per 100,000 people; housing affordability and variety of housing options; crime; voter participation; volunteerism; length of average commutes; and walkability.

The website pointed out Overland Park’s diversity of housing options, low property taxes, highly ranked public schools, relatively educated adult population and amenities, including 83 parks and six sports facilities.

The rankings also noted Manhattan’s nightlife in Aggieville and medical care at Mercy Regional Medical Center, and Lawrence’s arts and music scene.
