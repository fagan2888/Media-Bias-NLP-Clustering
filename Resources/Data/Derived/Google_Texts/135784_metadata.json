A wave of consolidations is sweeping the industry, and the largest chains are changing focus as they face increasing competition from more niche stores. Online-only competitors like Amazon Fresh and FreshDirect are also gaining market share.\n\nThe changes could be good news for consumers, many of whom have qualms about the current in-store shopping experience. A survey of more than 27,000 subscribers in the May issue of Consumer Reports finds that although most consumers are satisfied overall, more than half had at least one complaint about their current store. Almost a third of customers had two or more problems with their grocer.\n\nSLIDESHOW: The 14 Best Supermarkets in America in 2014\n\nThe survey revealed that a few stores are doing a great job of satisfying their customers. The magazine graded 55 major chains based on the consumer survey and found that east-coast chain Wegmans ranked the best, with a score of 88 out of 100 possible points.\n\nAt the other end of the list, retail behemoth Wal-Mart scored the worst, receiving a paltry 67. Other poor-ranking scores included Shaw\u2019s (69), Pathmark (70), and Acme (70).\n\nConsumers are becoming far less loyal to their supermarkets and are increasingly willing to visit more than one store, picking up the basics at one supermarket, traveling to another for ethnic or gourmet foods, and filling out the rest of their needs with online shipments.\n\nThe supermarket ratings are based on consumer responses in four categories: service (including employee courtesy and checkout speed), perishables (food quality), price, and cleanliness.\n\n\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The supermarket as we know it is changing.", "title": "The 14 Best Supermarkets in America in 2014", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/04/01/14-Best-Supermarkets-America-2014", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/Costco_Reuters_Mike_Blake.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/04/01/14-Best-Supermarkets-America-2014", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/Costco_Reuters_Mike_Blake.jpg", "creator": "@bethbrav", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The supermarket as we know it is changing.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "SLIDESHOW: The 14 Best Supermarkets in America in 2014The survey revealed that a few stores are doing a great job of satisfying their customers.\nThe magazine graded 55 major chains based on the consumer survey and found that east-coast chain Wegmans ranked the best, with a score of 88 out of 100 possible points.\nThe changes could be good news for consumers, many of whom have qualms about the current in-store shopping experience.\nA wave of consolidations is sweeping the industry, and the largest chains are changing focus as they face increasing competition from more niche stores.\nThe supermarket ratings are based on consumer responses in four categories: service (including employee courtesy and checkout speed), perishables (food quality), price, and cleanliness."}
