Burwell, the lawsuit that contends the ACA only authorized federal subsidy payments in health insurance marketplaces created by the states \u2014 but not in the federal marketplace, HealthCare.gov, which is used by millions of people in New Jersey and 33 other states.\n\nThe court is expected to decide the case by the end of June.\n\nRELATED: Obamacare making a dent in N.J.'s number of uninsured, survey finds\n\nOpposition to the ACA is led by Congressional Republicans, who have voted numerous times to repeal the law, which passed in 2010 without a single Republican vote.\n\nThe NJPP study, for the first time, uses ZIP code data to break down by Congressional district the number of Jerseyans getting ACA subsidies \u2014 and who would lose them if the court rules against the HealthCare.gov subsidies.\n\nThe data show that \u201cNew Jerseyans in solidly Republican and solidly Democratic Congressional districts would be affected equally, suggesting that this should be a nonpartisan issue,\u201d Castro said. His analysis found that, as of Jan. 15, there were 88,313 New Jerseyans receiving subsidies in Congressional districts represented by Republicans, while 87,924 get subsidies in districts represented by Democrats.\n\nWhen HealthCare.gov launched nationwide in 2014, about 162,000 New Jerseyans used the federal website to buy health insurance.\n\nBut enrollment rose dramatically in the second year of Obamacare: About 253,000 New Jerseyans have so far used HealthCare.gov to enroll in a 2015 health plan.\n\nCastro said federal data show that about 84 percent of them, or 210,000, qualified for tax credits averaging $3,708, which would translate into an aggregate loss of $780 million in federal funds to New Jersey if those subsidies are struck down.\n\nCastro said the loss of federal subsidies would dramatically shrink the state\u2019s individual health insurance market, which includes those who use HealthCare.gov to buy coverage as well as those who buy health plans directly from insurers. He predicted that premiums would rise overall in the individual market, since only the sickest people keep their insurance and there are fewer healthy people to spread the risk.\n\nCastro estimated premiums would rise overall in the individual market by 47 percent, pushing up the average premium to $8,489, from $5,772, and that about 246,000 New Jerseyans would drop health coverage they could no longer afford.\n\nCastro\u2019s estimates are in line with those of other health policy experts.\n\nJoel Cantor, director of the Rutgers Center for State Health Policy, cited Urban Institute estimates that New Jersey would lose $727 million a year, 237,000 Jerseyans would lose their subsidies and 239,000 New Jerseyans would drop coverage if the Supreme Court outlaws the HealthCare.gov subsidies.\n\n\u201cIt is not an understatement to say that a ruling in favor of the plaintiffs in the King case would render the New Jersey direct-purchase health insurance market nonfunctional,\u201d Cantor told NJBIZ. \u201cOver 200,000 would drop coverage due to loss of subsidies and rising premiums. Those remaining in the market would see initial premium increases of perhaps 40 percent to 50 percent, leading to further exit of younger and healthier insureds and ultimately a marketwide death spiral.\u201d\n\nCantor said that, without the subsidies, \u201cany remaining coverage available on the individual market would be extremely expensive, with very high cost-sharing and very limited provider networks. Some or even most insurers would withdraw from the market, reversing the progress we've seen in increased competition. We may even see one or more insurers go out of business altogether.\u201d\n\nThe impact on small employer group plans is harder to predict, but some of those who drop their individual policies will look at purchasing a group health insurance plan, Cantor said.\n\nWhile Gov. Chris Christie is on record in opposition to the ACA, he agreed to the ACA-funded Medicaid expansion that has added about 390,000 to NJFamilyCare, the state Medicaid program.\n\nState-run exchanges can continue to award subsidy dollars, regardless of the Supreme Court ruling. In 2012, New Jersey\u2019s Democrat-controlled Legislature twice passed bills to create a state-run insurance exchange that were vetoed by Christie.\n\nCastro said New Jersey should again try to create a state exchange in the event the court rules to abolish subsidies in the HealthCare.gov marketplace.\n\nCastro said state officials \u201cideally should start planning for a possible state exchange. They may have to be up and running very quickly: They can\u2019t just wait until a (Supreme Court) decision is made.\u201d\n\nAnd, Castro said, \u201cIf the governor is not going to go for a (state) exchange, he has to have some kind of a medical emergency plan\u201d for New Jerseyans who will drop their health coverage if they lose the subsidy.\n\nThe state\u2019s health care industry should also begin contingency planning in the event the Supreme Court rules against HealthCare.gov subsidies, Castro said.\n\n\u201cIf people become uninsured, they will go to community health centers and to hospitals\u201d for medical care, Castro said.\n\n\u201cA lot of people are going to be in the middle of treatment\u201d when the Supreme Court issues its ruling in June, Castro said. \u201cIf you have a heart operation scheduled, does that mean you don\u2019t get the operation? The health care industry needs to be thinking about what this means to them and how they can try to deal with it.\u201d\n\nClick here to subscribe to the NJBIZ e-newsletters\n\nSarah Lechner, general counsel of the New Jersey Hospital Association, said, \u201cNJHA is watching the case closely, as the impact of a negative ruling would be devastating to New Jersey hospitals.\u201d\n\nLechner said the availability of subsidies was one of the key tenets of the ACA, and more than 80 percent of New Jersey residents who have signed up for commercial insurance through the federally facilitated marketplace have been deemed eligible for these subsidies.\n\n\u201cThe loss of those subsidies could jeopardize insurance coverage for thousands of individuals, which in turn would put a greater burden on hospitals to care for the uninsured,\u201d Lechner said. \u201cHospitals will continue to provide the care, but the ongoing fiscal hit to hospitals would be significant.\u201d\n\nJohn Sarno, president of the Employer Association of New Jersey stated, \"All employers are stakeholders in the success of the Affordable Care Act. Both employers and employees want and need good health coverage at affordable prices. More than half of New Jersey's small employers do not provide health coverage. Giving uninsured workers the opportunity to get covered and receive financial assistance to purchase a plan for themselves and their families benefits us all.\u201d\n\nDaniel Santo Pietro of the Latino Action Network stated, \u201cA ruling for King would have a devastating impact on the Latino community. Latinos are disproportionately uninsured and it has been difficult to get them enrolled. A loss of subsidies that made their coverage affordable would be a major setback that will push our low income population even further back and increase the disparity they suffer in our state.\u201d\n\nNJPP released its study of the impact of the Supreme Court case at a Monday news conference at the Statehouse in Trenton organized by the NJ For Health Care Coalition.\n\nOrganizations that participated in the news conference included New Jersey Citizen Action, the Anti-Poverty Network of NJ, the Statewide Parent Advocacy Network, the National Association of Social Workers-NJ, the National Council of Alcoholism and Drug Dependence-NJ and the Mercer Hispanic Association.\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act is working by making a difference in the lives of hundreds of thousands of people all across our country,\u201d Maura Collinsgru, health care program director for New Jersey Citizen Action, said in a statement from the coalition following the news conference. \u201cThis is not a case of King v. Burwell. This is a case of King versus the more than 200,000 New Jerseyans and others like them all across America who have health coverage because of tax credits.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe legal basis of the argument in this case is weak,\u201d added Renee Steinhagen, attorney for New Jersey Appleseed. \u201cWhen Congress wrote and passed the ACA, everybody \u2014 Republicans, Democrats and the Congressional Budget Office alike \u2014 agreed that the tax credits would be available in all states.\u201d\n\nALSO ON NJBIZ:\n\nYoung entrepreneur's company is all about turnover\n\nHospital groups blast proposed charity-care cut: Budget 'doesn't recognize ongoing challenges'\n\nBreaking Glass: Joseph Bottitta of Genova Burns urges women to hang out and talk feminism with the guys", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "NJBIZ", "description": "New Jersey would lose $780 million a year in federal health insurance subsidies, thousands would drop their health coverage because they couldn't afford it, and a shrinking pool of customers would dr", "title": "Loss of HealthCare.gov subsidies could have devastating effect on N.J., study says | NJBIZ", "url": "http://www.njbiz.com/article/20150302/NJBIZ01/150309974/loss-of-healthcaregov-subsidies-could-have-devastating-effect-on-nj-study-says", "image": "http://www.njbiz.com/storyimage/NJ/20150302/NJBIZ01/150309974/AR/0/AR-150309974.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "njbiz.com", "description": "New Jersey would lose $780 million a year in federal health insurance subsidies, thousands would drop their health coverage because they couldn't afford it, and a shrinking pool of customers would dr", "creator": "@bethfitzgerald8", "image": {"src": "http://www.njbiz.com/storyimage/NJ/20150302/NJBIZ01/150309974/AR/0/AR-150309974.jpg"}, "title": "Loss of HealthCare.gov subsidies could have devastating effect on N.J., study says | NJBIZ", "site": "@njbiz", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "New Jersey would lose $780 million a year in federal health insurance subsidies, thousands would drop their health coverage because they couldn't afford it, and a shrinking pool of customers would drive up health insurance premiums.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfeb6\"", "article_summary": "The state\u2019s health care industry should also begin contingency planning in the event the Supreme Court rules against HealthCare.gov subsidies, Castro said.\nWhen HealthCare.gov launched nationwide in 2014, about 162,000 New Jerseyans used the federal website to buy health insurance.\nThe NJPP study, for the first time, uses ZIP code data to break down by Congressional district the number of Jerseyans getting ACA subsidies \u2014 and who would lose them if the court rules against the HealthCare.gov subsidies.\nNew Jersey would lose $780 million a year in federal health insurance subsidies, thousands would drop their health coverage because they couldn't afford it, and a shrinking pool of customers would drive up health insurance premiums.\nBoth employers and employees want and need good health coverage at affordable prices."}
