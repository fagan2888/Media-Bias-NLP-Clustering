They arrived Sunday morning at the Russell H. Perry Animal Care Center in McKinney, which is acting as a hub.\n\nFrom there they will be relocated to several animal welfare groups including the Houston SPCA, WildRescue, Inc., San Diego House Rabbit Society, Too Many Bunnies (California), Bunny Buddies (Houston), Citizens for Animal Protection (CAP of Houston) and will be put up for adoption. WildRescue, Inc. coordinated the transfer of the rabbits to the various groups.\n\n\u201cA lot of people are looking for rabbits around Easter \u2026 but Easter is not a good time to add a spur of the moment pet\u201d unless you\u2019ve been thinking about it for a while and have researched their needs, Davies said.\n\n\u201cThey require different care from dog or cats. They are a lot more fragile and have dietary restrictions.\u201d\n\nTen of the rabbits will stay at the SPCA of Texas. They will become available to hop into a forever home in the coming days and weeks.
