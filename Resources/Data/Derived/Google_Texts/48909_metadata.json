Direct comparisons to the previous midterms, in 2010, were not available, but Facebook said there were 71.7 million election-related mentions by U.S. users during the 2012 presidential election.\n\nMarijuana reform measures were on the ballot in three states (Alaska, Florida and Oregon) and the District of Columbia on Tuesday, so it is perhaps not surprising that weed dominated election-related chatter across the social network.\n\n\u201cTaxes,\u201d \u201cObamacare,\u201d \u201ceducation\u201d and \u201cvoter fraud\u201d rounded out the top five election-related topics, according to Facebook.\n\nThe top Facebook posts from politicians were a bipartisan mixed bag. Republicans may have seized control of the Senate on Tuesday, but it was Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts who dominated the social space. Warren\u2019s Tuesday morning Facebook post -- which featured a photo of the Senator scanning a ballot at her local polling place -- went viral with more interactions than any other Election Day post from a politician. As of Wednesday morning, the post had 1,874 shares, 45,202 likes and 1,296 comments.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nRepublican Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin came in second with his own ballot-scanning photo, followed by Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, who posted an \u201cI Voted to Reclaim America\u201d meme. Republican Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin rounded out the top four politicians with an \u201cI Voted for Walker\u201d meme.\n\nFrom July 10 through the end of the day on Tuesday, some 43 million U.S.-based Facebook users made 272 million interactions regarding the midterm elections. How much of that chatter translated to actual votes is still a bit of a mystery, as official results are not available yet. Voter turnout was higher than usual in some key battleground states, but the lowest on record in others, according to early data.\n\nPhoto: Reuters/IBTimes\n\nBelow is the full list of the top posts from politicians and the most talked-about election-related topics on Facebook.\n\nTop Posts From Politicians (Nov. 4, 2014)\n\nElizabeth Warren\n\n\n\nPaul Ryan\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio\n\n\n\nScott Walker\n\nTop Issues Nationally (Nov. 4, 2014)\n\n1.
