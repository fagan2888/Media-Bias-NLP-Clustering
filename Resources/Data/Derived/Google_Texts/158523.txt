NEW YORK (AP) - The NHL has fined New Jersey Devils forward Tuomo Ruutu $5,000 for kicking the legs out from under Pittsburgh forward Matt Cullen.

The fine, announced by the league Wednesday, is the maximum allowed under the collective bargaining agreement.

Ruutu was issued a minor penalty for tripping after he “slew-footed” Cullen early in the third period of Pittsburgh’s 6-1 win on Sunday.
