He points to President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act as an example of this, saying that it will lure people out of the workforce and into government dependency.\n\nMitchell says that federal government policy in the United States has also undermined the incentive for individuals to save their money.\n\n\u201cWe need to look at the role of government,\u201d said Mitchell. \u201cLet\u2019s look at what happens if you save: the government taxes the stuffing out of you. We double tax savings, we double tax dividends, we double tax capital gains, we have a death tax and that\u2019s just on the tax side of the fiscal equation.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Welfare state spending increases income inequality, according to a report from the European Central Bank.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "Welfare state spending increases income inequality, according to a report from the European Central Bank.
