Others feel that their children will be able to take care of them, but that isn't always possible and can still be very expensive for those providing the care. It is also important to understand that the need for long-term care can go on for years with illnesses such as Alzheimer's disease.\n\nWhen should I buy LTC insurance?\n\nThe best time to buy LTC insurance is when you are young and healthy. Unfortunately, many people seem to wait as they don't feel they will need the coverage until they get older. The problem is that premium rates generally increase with age, and health issues may develop that could make a person uninsurable at a later age. And, approximately 40 percent of all long-term care patients are under age 65.\n\nWhat is the cost of waiting to buy?\n\nThe graphic at left provides an example for a 52-year-old female Pennsylvania resident looking at a policy offering a 4 percent inflation rider on $200 daily benefit with a 90-day elimination period and 3-year benefit.\n\nIf she waits until age 62 to buy the policy, and assuming that she will remain healthy, the cost of waiting is significant. The annual premium for comparable coverage will have increased from $3,487.64 at age 52 up to $7,636.83 at age 62. If the policy premiums are paid through age 85, this delay would ultimately cost her an additional $60,554.97 in premiums.\n\nHow much LTC coverage do I need to buy? and Do I need to include an inflation rider on my LTC policy?\n\nThe answers to these questions depend on many factors such as the type of long-term care facility you would want to live in and where it is located. Costs increase every year, so an inflation rider is recommended.\n\nTo get a better understanding of how rates can vary by area, visit the following website: www.genworth.com/costofcare.\n\nAdditional information can also be found in the NAIC Shopper's Guide to Long Term Care (http://naic.org/store_pub_consumer.htm).
