I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s too late to change seats.\n\nThe guy is wearing a camouflage jacket that doesn\u2019t quite hide the bulging middle-age belly straining at the faded Patriots T-shirt underneath. He\u2019s carrying a sign that reads \u201cLike a Cruz missile, Ted will destroy ISIS\u201d on one side and \u201cCruzin West\u201d on the other, a plea for the Texas senator to pick former Florida congressman Allen West as his vice-presidential candidate. He\u2019s loudly telling everyone within earshot that we need to start a Cruz/West chant at some point and is met with approving responses from some of the people around me.\n\nI decide not to move. If the Oath Keeper or anyone else spies my reporter\u2019s notebook and asks what outlet I\u2019m with, I\u2019ll say World Net Daily and hope no one pulls out an iPhone to check.\n\nIt\u2019s all part of the carnival atmosphere of a Ted Cruz event being held at Elm Street Middle School, an imposing Gothic building that, as I drove up in the dark amidst a driving rain, made me think of an insane asylum in a movie, a comparison that felt more than appropriate once I was inside. Old men in baseball caps bearing the names of military units, moms holding babies in one hand and Ted Cruz signs in the other. Three people by the stage waving flags (from left to right: American, Israeli, Gadsden). Two flat-screen TVs on either side of the stage are showing a campaign film of more cheering crowds, backed by patriotic music and conservative activist Brent Bozell talking about all the reasons he loves Ted Cruz.\n\nThis is the New Hampshire I came to find. This is the polished and professional political rally of the true believers, ecstatic in their fervor and their belief in the rightness of their cause. It\u2019s exhilarating and terrifying. As the late great Hunter S. Thompson might have said, this is the belly of the beast.\n\nCruz is often described as \u201coily,\u201d but that word doesn\u2019t really do him justice. In fact, he\u2019s so oleaginous he reminds one of the puddles covering the stained cement floor of a Jiffy Lube. It\u2019s not just a physical characteristic \u2013 though there is that; the man has a sheen about him \u2013 but also one of affect. When he strides out to a rapturous greeting from the crowd and walks along the edge of the stage slapping hands with people in the front row, it feels so studied that I can picture college-age Ted Cruz practicing this move in his Princeton dorm room.\n\nThe speech is filled with the usual bullshit that no one will call him on, even in a GOP debate, because all the candidates are trying to appeal to a base that has gone beyond reason and Earth\u2019s orbit. But it\u2019s worth rebutting a few of the lies here, if only for the benefit of future archaeologists picking through the ruins of our civilization if Ted Cruz winds up leading it.\n\nFor economic policy, Cruz has a plan to turbocharge the American economy. It seems to go something like this:\n\nRepeal Obamacare\n\nInstitute a flat tax on all personal and business income\n\nEconomic growth!!!!!\n\nNever mind that this plan would yank health insurance from millions of people and blow a hole in the deficit, adding mountains to the nation\u2019s $19 trillion debt that he decried elsewhere in his sermon. \u201cRepeal Obamacare\u201d and \u201cflat tax\u201d are words that appeal to the deepest, most primitive part of the conservative lizard brain. Any downsides can just be blamed on liberals later on.\n\nAnother Cruz proposal involves eliminating five major government agencies, including the Internal Revenue Service. Which raises the question: Who will collect the taxes that people and businesses would still be paying even with a flat tax in place? You may as well just tell the crowd you\u2019re eliminating taxes altogether.\n\nOn his proposal to \u201ccarpet-bomb\u201d ISIS, Cruz has been getting blasted by military leaders for weeks for not seeming to know that carpet bombing is actually wildly inaccurate. Cruz either does not know this, or more likely he does not care. I\u2019m betting on the latter.\n\nThat\u2019s because he needs this audience, and every other audience, to believe in the holy rightness of his crusade. And if this crowd is any indication, he\u2019s succeeding. This rally has the feel of a campaign that could go all the way, no matter how dangerous the proposals driving it are.\n\nBecause these are the true believers, and true believers know that they are right and everyone else is not only wrong, but evil and stupid. (When Cruz mocks some environmental protesters who briefly interrupt him, the man sitting directly behind me yells with unsuppressed fury, \u201cThey\u2019re Bolsheviks!\u201d I can almost feel the spittle on the back of my neck.) This is a darker place than the Donald Trump rally I attended the night before. There, one got the sense Trump\u2019s support was a mile wide but an inch deep. This, though, this is something more primal.\n\nIt\u2019s all enough to make one despair, and to pray to a God you don\u2019t believe in that something can stop this train, that some part of the GOP establishment can still rally to knock down this campaign or that there is a very finite percentage of even conservative voters to whom it will appeal. And also to get out of this auditorium before Cruz pulls a couple of vipers from a sack and everyone starts speaking in tongues.", "article_metadata": {"description": "There's nothing quite like a middle school auditorium positively overflowing with Cruz supporters.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Alternet", "description": "There's nothing quite like a middle school auditorium positively overflowing with Cruz supporters.", "title": "The Special Hell of a Ted Cruz Rally: What It's Like to Spend an Evening With the GOP's Oiliest Operator", "url": "http://www.alternet.org/election-2016/special-hell-ted-cruz-rally-what-its-spend-evening-gops-oiliest-operator", "image": "http://www.alternet.org/files/story_images/ted_cruz15_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "dc": {"title": "The Special Hell of a Ted Cruz Rally: What It&#039;s Like to Spend an Evening With the GOP&#039;s Oiliest Operator"}, "fb": {"page_id": 17108852506, "pages": 17108852506}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-06T17:20:00"}, "google-site-verification": "-yUzdOYz6i2iShII0x_PYzsvnhQUG2f751funoPlCNM", "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "article_summary": "The Special Hell of a Ted Cruz Rally: What It's Like to Spend an Evening With the GOP's Oiliest OperatorThere is a boisterous Oath Keeper leaking alcohol from every pore sitting three seats away from me in a Nashua, New Hampshire, middle school auditorium hosting a Ted Cruz town hall.\nOld men in baseball caps bearing the names of military units, moms holding babies in one hand and Ted Cruz signs in the other.\n\u201cRepeal Obamacare\u201d and \u201cflat tax\u201d are words that appeal to the deepest, most primitive part of the conservative lizard brain.\nIt seems to go something like this:Repeal ObamacareInstitute a flat tax on all personal and business incomeEconomic growth!!!!!\nWhich raises the question: Who will collect the taxes that people and businesses would still be paying even with a flat tax in place?"}
