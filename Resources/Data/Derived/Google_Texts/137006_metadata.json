A recent study published in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism found sildenafil \u2014 the drug that treats erectile dysfunction (ED) \u2014 can ward off type 2 diabetes in those with prediabetes, while reducing the risk of heart and kidney disease.\n\nIn the U.S., 29 million Americans have diabetes and three in 10 adults have prediabetes, according to the Society\u2019s Endocrine Facts and Figures report. Without intervention, 30 percent of people with prediabetes are likely to develop type 2 diabetes within five years. Dr. Nancy J. Brown, author of the study from Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville, Tenn., believes additional strategies, like sildenafil, are necessary to help slow the progression from prediabetes to diabetes.\n\n\"Weight loss and exercise regimens can be difficult to maintain, and some current medications have been limited by concerns about adverse effects. Sildenafil and related drugs could offer a potential avenue for addressing the rising number of diabetes diagnoses,\" she said in the press release.\n\nSildenafil, typically known for treating ED, works by inhibiting an enzyme that breaks down the natural blood vessel-relaxing chemical, cGMP. The drug has been proven to increase insulin sensitivity in mice, but the effect of the drug on humans with prediabetes has been unknown.\n\nSomeone who is insulin sensitive requires smaller amounts of insulin to lower blood sugar levels than someone who has a low sensitivity, or is insulin resistant. Insulin resistance occurs when there are high blood sugar levels in the body and the individual cannot produce enough insulin, or insulin does not function properly to clear sugar from the bloodstream. This can lead to the development of type 2 diabetes.\n\nBrown and her colleagues recruited 51 overweight participants with prediabetes to determine whether sildenafil can improve insulin sensitivity. The participants were given 25 milligrams of sildenafil three times per day or an inactive placebo for three months. They underwent a hyperglycemic clamp prior to and at the end of treatment to measure glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and their insulin sensitivity. Urine samples were also collected for measurement of albumin and creatinine, which are indicators of heart and kidney health.\n\nThe findings revealed the participants who were treated with sildenafil were more sensitive to the effects of insulin. Sildenafil also lowered levels of albumin in the urine than those who took the placebo. High levels of albumin in urine are a marker for the risk of kidney and heart disease.\n\nDrugs like sildenafil also affect the function of the inner lining of the blood vessels. This has a subtle effect on blood sugar metabolism and insulin resistance.\n\n\"Because existing drug therapies to prevent type 2 diabetes can have negative effects on the heart or be of limited use in patients with kidney disease, strategies to prevent diabetes without adversely affecting the risk of kidney and heart disease could have a large impact on public health,\" Brown said.\n\nViagra as a treatment for type 2 diabetes could be valuable for diabetic men who take the drug to treat ED. ED is a common occurrence in men with diabetes, because it is related to a decrease in the blood supply to the penis as well as damage to the nerves that are responsible for getting an erection, according to the Mayo Clinic. A decrease in testosterone production has also been identified as the cause in some men with diabetes.\n\nMen shouldn't rush to take the sex drug just yet, though. Researchers warn further research is still needed with larger clinical trials and over extended periods of time to determine if sildenafil could become an easier alternative for diabetes management and reduce the incidence of type 2 diabetes.\n\nSources: Ramirez CE, Hui N, Yu C et al.
