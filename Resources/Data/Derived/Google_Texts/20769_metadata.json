Dozens of corporations and faith-based nonprofits have sued over the rule, resulting in a Supreme Court decision known as \u201cHobby Lobby\u201d and two administrative attempts to satisfy faith-based nonprofits.\n\nFederal courts asked administration lawyers and the nonprofits to update their legal arguments after a series of actions this summer that advanced the debate \u2014 chiefly the ruling in the \u201cHobby Lobby\u201d case. It said closely held corporations can\u2019t be forced to pay for contraceptive care if the owners have a legitimately held religious objection.\n\nShortly after that, the court issued an order that said Wheaton College, a Christian institution, did not have to comply with the mandate for the time being, as challenges from nonprofits work their way through the appellate courts.\n\nPriests for Life said the Supreme Court\u2019s actions \u201cconfirm what Plaintiffs have argued all along: The Government substantially burdens the exercise of religion whenever it forces religious believers to violate their sincere religious beliefs.\u201d\n\nIt also said HHS\u2019s new waiver process still makes them complicit in providing services they object to on moral grounds, including morning-after pills that they deem to be abortifacients.\n\nThe government, though, said under the new rules the nonprofit \u201cmerely informs\u201d the administration of its objection, and it\u2019s the government that orders the insurer or third party administrator to provide contraceptive coverage.\n\n\u201cIt is one thing for plaintiffs to decline to provide coverage themselves,\u201d attorneys said in court briefs. \u201cIt is quite another to insist that they have a right to veto federal regulations that impose duties on other persons.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Another high-level litigant has formally rejected the Obama administration's latest attempt to water down an Obamacare mandate that requires most group health plans to cover birth control.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Another high-level litigant has formally rejected the Obama administration\u2019s latest attempt to water down an Obamacare mandate that requires most group health plans to cover birth control.", "title": "Priests for Life: We\u2019re not stopping our fight against birth control mandate, either", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/sep/17/priests-life-were-not-stopping-our-fight-against-b/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/07/02/corporations-as-peoplejpeg-01bf0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/07/02/corporations-as-peoplejpeg-01bf0.jpg", "description": "Another high-level litigant has formally rejected the Obama administration's latest attempt to water down an Obamacare mandate that requires most group health plans to cover birth control.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Priests for Life: We\u2019re not stopping our fight against birth con"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Law Crime, Politics, Religion Belief, Barack Obama, Supreme Court"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd92dd\"", "article_summary": "It said closely held corporations can\u2019t be forced to pay for contraceptive care if the owners have a legitimately held religious objection.\n\u201cIt is one thing for plaintiffs to decline to provide coverage themselves,\u201d attorneys said in court briefs.\nAnother high-level litigant has formally rejected the Obama administration\u2019s latest attempt to water down an Obamacare mandate that requires most group health plans to cover birth control.\n\u201cIn truth, the new regulations do nothing more than provide Plaintiffs with another avenue for violating their religion,\u201d attorneys wrote in court papers filed late Tuesday.\nAttorneys for Priests for Life, an anti-abortion ministry, told the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit that the latest tweak to the so-called contraception mandate \u201cimpermissibly facilitates\u201d coverage of objectionable contraceptives."}
