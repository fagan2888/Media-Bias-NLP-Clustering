Partridge\n\nGustavo Frazao / Shutterstock\n\nSince its inception one year ago, the Affordable Care Act has garnered its fair share of both friends and foes. And many have expressed mixed feelings: support for the ideas behind the Act, but complaints about its execution, and concerns about its costs. Obamacare also presents both challenges and opportunities for local businesses seeking to provide health care coverage for their employees.\n\nA forum held earlier this month by the Business Council of Westchester took a look at the impact of Obamacare one year after its launch\u2014and found that sentiments are still mixed.\n\nHere is what some of the featured panelists had to say:\n\nDennis Gonzalez, executive officer for Region 2 of the federal Health and Human Services Department, noted that roughly one-third of eligible Americans who were previously uninsured are now insured since the Affordable Health Care Act\u2019s rollout. New enrollees also seem to be spending less money, he pointed out: seven out of 10 are paying $100 or less a month on their premiums. \u201cIt\u2019s unrealistic to think the cost of health care is not going to go up next year,\u201d added Gonzalez. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen the lowest increase in health care premiums in 30 years.\u201d\n\nDanielle Holahan, Director of Policy and Planning, New York Health Exchange, offered these statistics: nearly 1 million New Yorkers enrolled in the New York Health Benefit Exchange in 2014, about 52% of which are from New York City. A statewide total of 3,106 businesses with 50 or fewer employees enrolled with insurance carriers offering plans on the exchange. Those businesses enrolled nearly 10,000 employees statewide. In Westchester County, 323 employees were covered in 2014 on group plans purchased on the Exchange. Holahan said the state has implemented a streamlined renewal process for individuals and businesses enrolled on the exchange. \u201cThere\u2019s minimal change in the product offerings from last year, and that\u2019s intentional,\u201d she said.\n\nCraig Hauben, Chief Sales and Marketing Officer, North Shore LIJ CareConnect, explained that healthcare providers are looking into different ways of providing services to keep costs down. North Shore-LIJ recently launched its own insurance company called CareConnect to cut out middleman costs and provide a more personalized care.\n\nGuy Leibler, President of Simone Healthcare Development, discussed his company\u2019s responses to changes in the healthcare industry. Simone is developing mixed-use environments to take advantage of \"people places\" and provide a quality experience for the patient and co-visitors, he explained.\n\nThe impact of the Affordable Care Act one year after its launch was the focus of a recent seminar held by The Business Council of Westchester. The event, which was held Nov. 20 at the Doubletree Hotel in Tarrytown, featured a panel of experts discussing the ACA\u2019s impact on business. The Keynote Speaker was Dennis E. Gonz\u00e1lez, Executive Officer, Office of the Secretary, Region II, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Panelists included Elisabeth Benjamin, Vice President of Health Initiatives, Community Service Society of New York; Craig Hauben, Chief Sales and Marketing Officer, North Shore LIJ CareConnect; Danielle Holahan, Director of Policy and Planning, New York Health Exchange; Guy Leibler, President, Simone Healthcare Development, and Mary Jane D. O'Connell, Ph.D., Associate Dean for Academic Affairs, Fordham School of Professional and Continuing Studies. Pictured, from left, Craig Hauben, Elisabeth Benjamin, Danielle Holahan, Dennis E.
