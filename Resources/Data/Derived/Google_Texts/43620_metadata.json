McCoy of the Knoxville News Sentinel\n\nSome Knox County school board members are still hearing from teachers and principals about their struggles to fill their absences with substitute teachers.\n\nThe issue was a main topic Monday at a lunch meeting held at Panera Bread on Cumberland Avenue by several board members who wanted to get together to talk about some items in between their regular scheduled meetings.\n\nAttending the meeting were board members Patti Bounds, Amber Rountree, Terry Hill and Doug Harris. They were joined by Tanya Coats, president of the Knox County Education Association, and Elizabeth Alves, the school system\u2019s assistant superintendent of curriculum and instruction.\n\n\u201cIt really spurred on because of being together at our (Bible study meetings), when we would start visiting and a subject would come up, but we can\u2019t talk about it,\u201d Hill said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been very, very aware of not violating any laws. So we said let\u2019s sit down and have lunch and talk about this.\u201d\n\nThe group discussed continuing the meetings and possibly even moving them to the evenings to allow other members the chance to attend.\n\nOne cause of the substitute teacher shortage has been a change the district has had to make as a result of the Affordable Care Act, which mandates health care benefits be provided if a substitute works more than a certain number of hours. As a result, the school system has restricted substitutes to working 120 hours a month.\n\nTo look at these issues and come up with recommendations, the school system has formed a 14-member committee, convened by Kathy Sims, the school system\u2019s chief human resources officer.\n\nSome of the recommendations included a substitute teacher recruitment fair and differential pay of $25 for substitutes who work at schools with a percentage of unfilled teacher absences of 15 percent or more and an additional $20 a day for subs who work on Mondays and Friday. Substitutes currently are paid $68 for certified positions.\n\nHill, who represents schools in part of the West part of the county, said she has heard that the differential pay has created another problem.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s made the schools in my district \u2026 they\u2019re losing their subs because the subs are holding out to see if they get to a school where they can get more money,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s hurting ours. One of the secretaries had to spend the first hour and a half of school calling, just calling trying to get subs in. I don\u2019t know if money will change that or not.\u201d\n\nHarris recommended looking at a company that manages substitutes based out of Nashville. The company is similar to a temp agency, he said.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is we have to get that filled,\u201d he said. \u201cIt pays the same ... they just know how to recruit. They have a computer system so you don\u2019t have to do all of that calling.\u201d\n\nBounds, who went to the substitute recruitment fair on Dec. 6, said she was encouraged by the turn out. She said she has also been talking to officials at the schools in the northwest part of the county, and those who are subbing.\n\n\u201cIs it solved? No. Is it better. I don\u2019t know,\u201d she said. \u201cFrom what I understand by talking to Kathy (Sims), it\u2019s improving and they\u2019re encouraged by that especially in some of those high needs schools but that\u2019s not helping your schools.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"title": "Substitute staffing top issue at school board members' gathering", "og": {"url": "http://www.knoxnews.com/news/education/substitute-staffing-top-issue-at-school-board-members-gathering-ep-828207717-353780631.html", "image": {"width": 482, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/lunch_11171222_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "height": 480}, "type": "article", "description": "Four Knox County school board members discussed the issue at a lunch meeting held at Panera Bread on Cumberland Avenue on Monday.", "title": "Substitute staffing top issue at school board members' gathering"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/lunch_11171222_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "description": "Four Knox County school board members discussed the issue at a lunch meeting held at Panera Bread on Cumberland Avenue on Monday.", "site": "https://twitter.com/knoxnews", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Substitute staffing top issue at school board members' gathering"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-kns-icon-144.png", "__sync_contentCategory": "premium", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccbd8\"", "article_summary": "By Lydia X.
