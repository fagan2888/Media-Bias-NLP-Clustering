We regret any inconvenience this may have caused. Our priority is to always provide our guests a great experience every day so they can enjoy our wings, beer and sports.\"\n\nSome economic experts said even though you may not see a charge from a business up front, you are still fronting the bill because companies are raising prices elsewhere.\n\nMadison Alewel - NewsChannel 10", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Amarillo, TX - Some Buffalo Wild Wings customers are noticing an extra charge on their bills that up til now has not been seen in the Panhandle.", "author": "Madison Alewel", "og": {"url": "http://www.newschannel10.com/story/27788195/affordable-care-act-surcharge-tacked-on-to-restaurant-bills", "image": "http://KFDA.IMAGES.worldnow.com/images/6388535_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Amarillo, TX - Some Buffalo Wild Wings customers are noticing an extra charge on their bills that up til now has not been seen in the Panhandle.", "title": "Affordable Care Act surcharge tacked on to restaurant bills"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KFDA.IMAGES.worldnow.com/images/6388535_G.jpg", "creator": "https://twitter.com/MadisonAlewel", "description": "Amarillo, TX - Some Buffalo Wild Wings customers are noticing an extra charge on their bills that up til now has not been seen in the Panhandle.", "card": "summary", "title": "Affordable Care Act surcharge tacked on to restaurant bills"}, "wnreadableurl": "affordable-care-act-surcharge-tacked-on-to-restaurant-bills", "ROBOTS": "Index,Follow,NoArchive", "date": "2015/01/07", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "owner": "KFDA", "KEYWORDS": "KFDA-TV, NewsChannel 10, Amarillo, Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, News, Weather, Sports, Doppler Dave, Severe Weather, Video", "wn-base": "IIS15", "news_keywords": "KFDA-TV, NewsChannel 10, Amarillo, Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, News, Weather, Sports, Doppler Dave, Severe Weather, Video"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf08f\"", "article_summary": "The Buffalo Wild Wings restaurants in both Amarillo and Lubbock recently attempted to pass their employee health insurance costs on to their customers by adding an Affordable Care Act surcharge.\nThe Howard Restaurant Group who owns the Buffalo Wild Wings said it implemented the surcharge instead of cutting employee hours or raising prices.\nAmarillo, TX - Some Buffalo Wild Wings customers are noticing an extra charge on their bill that up until now has not been seen in the Panhandle.\nAfter being contacted by NewsChannel 10 on Wednesday, Heather Leiferman, the director of public relations for Buffalo Wild Wings, Inc, released a statement saying, \"The health care surcharge at our franchised Buffalo Wild Wings in Lubbock and Amarillo has been removed.\nSome economic experts said even though you may not see a charge from a business up front, you are still fronting the bill because companies are raising prices elsewhere."}
