Surely, they\u2019d be overjoyed.\n\nIf they knew what those candidates would be saying, though, they\u2019d have been horrified.\n\nAn \u201cautopsy\u201d of that earlier election showed that Hispanics\u2014many of whom are conservative Catholics\u2014felt ignored and discredited by Romney, so they voted for Obama.\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s the Compliment Trump Gave the Pope After Being Slammed on Immigration\n\nRepublican National Committee chair Reince Priebus commissioned the party\u2019s \u201cGrowth and Opportunity\u201d project to see what went wrong and how to fix it. One of the key findings was that the Party had alienated the fastest-growing segment of the electorate: Hispanics.\n\n\u201cIt is imperative that the RNC changes how it engages with Hispanic communities to welcome in new members of our Party,\u201d the authors determined.\n\n\u201cIf Hispanic Americans hear that the GOP doesn\u2019t want them in the United States, they won\u2019t pay attention to our next sentence. It doesn\u2019t matter what we say about education, jobs or the economy; if Hispanics think that we do not want them here, they will close their ears to our policies. Hispanic voters tell us our Party\u2019s position on immigration has become a litmus test, measuring whether we are meeting them with a welcome mat or a closed door,\u201d the report found.\n\nTo move forward and grow the Party, they said, \u201cWe must embrace and champion comprehensive immigration reform. If we do not, our Party\u2019s appeal will continue to shrink to its core constituencies only. We also believe that comprehensive immigration reform is consistent with Republican economic policies that promote job growth and opportunity for all.\u201d\n\nRelated: Biden Won\u2019t Rule Out the Possibility of a Trump Victory\n\nSo, on its face, the prospect of having two men named Cruz and Rubio making legitimate runs for the GOP nomination would surely have heartened GOP leaders still reeling from Romney\u2019s defeat and worried about the party\u2019s future with Hispanic voters.\n\nFast forward to 2016, though, and whatever hopes the Party elders harbored for Hispanic outreach have been dashed against the reality of the GOP base. In an effort to court Republican primary voters, the three leading candidates for the GOP nomination have essentially surrendered all hope of appealing to the Hispanic community that party leaders wanted them to embrace.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s message that undocumented immigrants are rapists and killers who need to be deported en masse and then sealed behind a wall is resonating powerfully with a large segment of the primary electorate. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who also read the mood of the Party base correctly more than a year ago, has been railing against any policy that would allow undocumented immigrants to remain in the country as \u201camnesty.\u201d\n\nAnd candidates like former Florida governor Jeb Bush and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who have suggested treating undocumented immigrants humanely in line with American values, have been relegated to the second tier of the GOP primary.\n\nStill, Republicans are not alone in seeking an end to illegal immigration. A recent Monmouth University Poll showed that Republicans (73%) are much more likely than independents (47%) or Democrats (31%) to support building a wall.\n\nRelated: Clinton Sharply Challenges Sanders\u2019 Immigration Credentials in Nevada\n\nThe last of the top tier candidates, and the only one who has a recent history of advocating something other than immediate mass deportation, is Marco Rubio, and as the Washington Post\u2019s Greg Sargent pointed out, he appears to have abandoned one of his only remaining positions that offered a glimmer of hope to those in the country illegally.\n\nRubio had previously been one of the party\u2019s leading voices for immigration reform, joining the \u201cGang of Eight\u201d in the Senate, which engineered the passage of a major bipartisan immigration reform bill. He has since disavowed the proposal, saying that it was the best Republicans could get when the Democrats controlled the Senate, but not something he would support as president.\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s Delayed Action for Childhood Arrivals program allows some immigrants who were brought to the country illegally as children to live without fear of imminent deportation, so long as they don\u2019t break the law and meet other requirements. Rubio, just last year, said that he opposed DACA, but recognized that summarily ending the program would create massive and unnecessary upheaval.\n\nHowever, speaking to CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on Thursday, Rubio confirmed, \u201cI will, on my first day in office, get rid of it because it\u2019s unconstitutional. I was against it when the president did it. I remain against it now. It cannot be permanent policy. And I\u2019ve said that repeatedly.\u201d\n\nAt this point, if the RNC\u2019s determination that immigration policy is a \u201clitmus test\u201d with Hispanic voters still holds true, then it\u2019s hard to see what\u2019s left for them to hold on to among the Republican frontrunners. And if they were also correct to predict that the Party, without courting Hispanics, \u201cwill shrink to its core constituencies only,\u201d well, that\u2019s pretty bad news for the GOP.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "In an effort to court Republican primary voters, the three leading candidates for the GOP nomination have essentially surrendered all hope of appealing to the Hispanic community that party leaders wanted them to embrace.", "title": "With Rubio\u2019s Latest Flip-Flop, the GOP May Have Given Up on the Hispanic Vote", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/19/Rubio-s-Latest-Flip-Flop-GOP-May-Have-Given-Hispanic-Vote", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election-rubio_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/19/Rubio-s-Latest-Flip-Flop-GOP-May-Have-Given-Hispanic-Vote", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election-rubio_2.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "In an effort to court Republican primary voters, the three leading candidates for the GOP nomination have essentially surrendered all hope of appealing to the Hispanic community that party leaders wanted them to embrace.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "To move forward and grow the Party, they said, \u201cWe must embrace and champion comprehensive immigration reform.\n\u201cIf Hispanic Americans hear that the GOP doesn\u2019t want them in the United States, they won\u2019t pay attention to our next sentence.\nFast forward to 2016, though, and whatever hopes the Party elders harbored for Hispanic outreach have been dashed against the reality of the GOP base.\nRubio had previously been one of the party\u2019s leading voices for immigration reform, joining the \u201cGang of Eight\u201d in the Senate, which engineered the passage of a major bipartisan immigration reform bill.\n\u201cIt is imperative that the RNC changes how it engages with Hispanic communities to welcome in new members of our Party,\u201d the authors determined."}
