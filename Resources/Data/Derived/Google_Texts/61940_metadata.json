Yet even in the glow of the recent successes of the law is the looming question of what it will cost the country\u2014both to the government and consumers. It\u2019s quite clear that the arguments on health care in the U.S. moving forward will revolve around the issue of the law\u2019s affordability.\n\nA recent Kaiser Family Foundation study analyzed the \u201cbenchmark\u201d plan premium costs (second lowest-cost silver plan) in major cities across all states in the U.S. and revealed that a majority of those cities would be facing precipitous increases to their monthly health insurance premiums for 2016. The increase for 2016 was as high as 38.4 percent in Nashville.[2] These insurance marketplaces, or exchanges, a feature central to the ACA, had originally been designed to provide a place where those without employer-sponsored coverage or not eligible for Medicaid or Medicare could shop for health plans. The theory behind these exchanges was that competition amongst insurers participating on the exchange would keep the prices of those plans low.\n\nAt this point, however, it\u2019s unclear the extent to which this is actually working. In at least some of the cities analyzed by this study, premiums have been relatively stable. Additionally, the study found some cities which even saw decreases to their premiums, such as Chicago and Seattle. Yet the overall trend of increases paints a somewhat unsettling trend of rising premium costs. According to the White House, 86 percent of enrollees on the exchanges receive subsides from the federal government to help offset the costs of the mandate to purchase health insurance. Thus, the rising costs are increasing the fiscal responsibility of the government to help subsidize those plans.\n\nConcerns over the affordability of health insurance don\u2019t stop on the exchanges either. In addition to premium increases across the nation\u2019s health insurance marketplaces are potential challenges to the affordability of care for those enrolled in employer-sponsored plans, which represent roughly half of the total insured population. Although the average premiums under employer-sponsored plans have only experienced modest increases, the limit for deductibles has increased dramatically over the past several years. Put simply, the costs of care appear to be shifting from employers and onto employees.\n\nIncreased deductibles mean that the costs incurred from health related expenses will be increasingly absorbed by employees. From a financial perspective, the value of these plans to employees is clearly decreasing.\n\nOther notable gaps in the ACA\u2019s mission to provide affordable care to Americans include the \u201cfamily glitch\u201d in which employers are only responsible to provide affordable coverage to the individual employee and not their family, which affects roughly 4 million people and the Medicaid coverage gap created by the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in National Federation of Independent Businesses v Sebelius. This decision made Medicaid expansion in states optional, leaving more than 3 million low-income people without the means to attain coverage across the twenty non-expansion states. Childless adults who fall under the federal poverty line\u2014$24,250 for a family of four\u2014in those states receive no subsides from the federal government for health insurance. This is due to the fact that the law was built on the assumption that those people would be covered under Medicaid, so they are ineligible for any subsidies on the private market.\n\nThere can be no denying that the ACA has experienced great success in lowering the uninsured rate in the nation, nor should that accomplishment be undersold. However, recent cost increases in the exchanges, cost-shifting onto those enrolled in employer-sponsored plans, the family glitch, and the Medicaid coverage gap raises the issue of the law\u2019s affordability moving forward.\n\n[1] U.S. Census Bureau, \u201cHealth Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2014\u201d (September 2015).
