The easiest thing is to get cynical. The Republicans had a good night on Tuesday \u2014 but believe me when I tell you that our results were better because you stepped up, talked to your family and friends, and cast your ballot.\n\nI want you to remember that we\u2019re making progress. There are workers who have jobs today who didn\u2019t have them before. There are millions of families who have health insurance today who didn\u2019t have it before. There are kids going to college today who didn\u2019t have the opportunity to go to college before.\n\nSo don\u2019t get cynical. Cynicism didn\u2019t put a man on the moon. Cynicism has never won a war, or cured a disease, or built a business, or fed a young mind. Cynicism is a choice. And hope will always be a better choice.\n\nI have hope for the next few years, and I have hope for what we\u2019re going to accomplish together. If you do, too, join the Democratic Party, and let\u2019s keep building this movement:\n\nThank you so much.\n\nBarack Obama\n\nThe President may have intended to say \u201cour results, as bad as they were, were better than they would have been had you not stepped up, talked to your family and friends, and cast your ballot.\u201d\n\nBut that language would have led to the inevitable question \u2014 how much worse would it have been had the recipients of this email not voted for the President\u2019s policies, which the rest of the country soundly rejected?", "article_metadata": {"description": "DNC Email Signed by Obama: 'The Republicans Had a Good Night, But Our Results Were Better'", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "DNC Email Signed by Obama: 'The Republicans Had a Good Night, But Our Results Were Better'", "title": "DNC Email Signed by Obama: 'The Republicans Had a Good Night, But Our Results Were Better' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/11/09/Arrogant-Obamajpg.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2014/11/09/barack-obama-email-shows-he-s-in-denial-the-republicans-had-a-good-night-but-our-results-were-better/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "DNC Email Signed by Obama: 'The Republicans Had a Good Night, But Our Results Were Better'", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/11/09/Arrogant-Obamajpg.jpg", "title": "DNC Email Signed by Obama: 'The Republicans Had a Good Night, But Our Results Were Better' - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": ",Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "published_time": "2014-11-09T06:55:00-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe Republicans had a good night on Tuesday \u2014 but believe me when I tell you that our results were better because you stepped up, talked to your family and friends, and cast your ballot,\u201d the e-mail read.\nThe Republicans had a good night on Tuesday \u2014 but believe me when I tell you that our results were better because you stepped up, talked to your family and friends, and cast your ballot.\nThere are kids going to college today who didn\u2019t have the opportunity to go to college before.\nThere are millions of families who have health insurance today who didn\u2019t have it before.\nThe full email reads:The hardest thing in politics is changing the status quo."}
