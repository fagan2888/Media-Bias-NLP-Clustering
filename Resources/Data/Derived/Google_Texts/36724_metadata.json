(Copernicus Healthcare, 2015)\n\nIn it, Freeman calls for a universal healthcare single payer system.\n\nThis would be different from Obamacare, in that it would effectively push aside the health insurance corporations in favor of one public single payer.\n\n\u201cEmbedded structural wrongdoing is the biggest challenge,\u201d Freeman told Corporate Crime Reporter in an interview last week. \u201cIf somebody goes into a gas station and holds a gun on somebody and steals $100, that\u2019s easy to identify. But there is structural wrongdoing that costs the American consumers huge amounts of money \u2014 such as subsidizing profits for the oil companies that provide that gasoline.\u201d\n\n\u201cStructural wrongdoing is the most difficult to identify. Structural wrongdoing is the most difficult to understand. Corporate criminality is the most dangerous. It\u2019s the most evil because those in charge know what they are doing. They are not doing it because they need the $100 to feed their family or their drug habit. They are doing it because they can. And we end up with things like the banks being too big to fail and having to be bailed out.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the case of healthcare, we build the stealing into the whole structure of the system.\u201d\n\nAt the beginning of the book Freeman quotes from Paul Batalden \u2014 every system is perfectly designed to get the results that it gets.\n\n\u201cAnd in some ways, that\u2019s obvious. If you are getting certain results, then your system must be designed to get them,\u201d Freeman says.\n\n\u201cWe are getting profits for large corporations and individuals and not the health of the American people. And that is a result of the way the system is designed.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is successful in generating profits for people. It is not successful in providing optimal health for the American people.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying the system was designed to attain profits for health insurance companies,\u201d Freeman says. \u201cI\u2019m saying the system is perfectly designed to do what it does \u2014 whether that was the intent or not. I don\u2019t know what the intent was. But the result is that the system is designed to make large profits for many corporations and some individuals and not to improve health. And the health status of the American people by measure after measure is at the bottom when it comes to the seventeen wealthiest nations.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy proposal is that we move to a single payer system. That doesn\u2019t address all of the social determinants of health. The single payer system doesn\u2019t make poor people not poor any more. It doesn\u2019t create sidewalks in neighborhoods that don\u2019t have sidewalks. It doesn\u2019t reduce crime in neighborhoods with high crime. It doesn\u2019t build grocery stores that are convenient to people, or parks where people can exercise. But it does make healthcare available to everyone.\u201d\n\nFreeman admits up front that Obamacare was a bandaid approach, but he supported it.\n\n\u201cPeople got covered who previously weren\u2019t covered,\u201d Freeman said. \u201cSeveral million people who didn\u2019t have health insurance before were now covered by expanded Medicaid in the states that have it. Those people were suffering. This decreases their suffering. I know that is a liberal half baked sentiment, but it\u2019s a real thing when you see real people\u2019s suffering.\u201d\n\n\u201cI work a lot in a student run free clinic. We can do what we as individual doctors can do. But we can\u2019t pay for their hospitalization. If they need surgery, we can\u2019t pay for their surgery. If they need expensive drugs, we can\u2019t pay for their drugs. If they need imaging, we can\u2019t pay for that. I know a lot of those people, who were covered in the exchanges. If we had expanded Medicaid, a lot more people would be able to get the care they need. I don\u2019t have the heartlessness to say \u2014 we can\u2019t do that because it slows down the pressure for a true single payer reform.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are weak bandaids,\u201d Freeman said. \u201cWe do it because if you put a bandaid on something, maybe it stops the bleeding for a while.\u201d\n\nPolitics can be counterintuitive. Nebraska last week banned the death penalty, for example. Freeman is in Kansas, a red state. What kind of support is there for single payer in Kansas?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know of any polls on single payer here in Kansas or even of doctors in Kansas,\u201d Freeman says. \u201cThere are many doctors I know who are supportive of single payer. And some people in specialized medicine that I wouldn\u2019t have expected would support single payer \u2014 and they do. That\u2019s because the system is so irrational now. Individual hospitals and physicians or groups of physicians have to spend an enormous amount of money on staff to be able to file insurance claims, to appeal their insurance claims, to figure out which policy of the same company you have and how many co-insurances you have, whether you have met your deductible for the year. You have the administrative costs for both hospitals and doctors. They have to figure out what your insurance coverage is, how to get paid by them and how to appeal denials. Those costs are phenomenally high. And many doctors believe that single payer would be a better way.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would guess that in the Kansas legislature, there is not a lot of support for single payer or any other program that is about social justice.\u201d\n\n[For the complete q/a format Interview with Joshua Freeman, see 29 Corporate Crime Reporter 23(12), June 8, 2015, print edition only.]", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Corporate Crime Reporter", "description": "The American healthcare system is riddled with fraud.
