And yes, there's some video.\n\nThe Orange County Register reported that Frickman hightailed it to Dana Point Harbor while calling the Orange County Sheriff\u2019s Harbor Patrol on his radio. The deputies got Chrissie and daughter Courtney (who had been less seriously whacked) on their way for medical treatment and then managed to manhandle the bloody dolphin\u2014500 pounds according to CNN; 350 according to the Register\u2014back into the ocean. It swam off appearing no worse for the experience except for cuts on the nose and tail.\n\nThe Register quoted Mr. Frickman on lesson learned: \u201cFrom seven years watching them, dolphins have been so precise in their movements, but you just never know. Maybe you want to stay a bit farther away.\u201d Kudos to the Frickmans for understanding that wild animals can be unpredictable and ought not to be killed for it.\n\nPredisposed to side with our own species, most of us would say that saving wild animals is admirable behavior and saving human beings is even more admirable, especially when combined with sacrifice and risk. These would be the values underpinning Robert D. McFadden\u2019s New York Times obituary for Nicholas Winton, who walked on after 106 well-lived years. Winton compares to the better known Raoul Wallenberg and Oskar Schindler. Those men were British, Swedish and German respectively, but they had in common that they risked lives and fortunes to rescue as many fellow human beings as possible from the Shoah.\n\nWinton\u2019s work was particularly heartbreaking because he rescued children whose parents entrusted them to strangers. The United States, to its eternal shame, maintained strict limits on Jewish immigration, even after Kristallnacht.\n\nFelix S. Cohen, revered by Indian lawyers for authoring the Handbook of Federal Indian Law, floated a plan to resettle Jews in Alaska, but he could not make the political lift. The U.S. response to impending mass murder was dramatized in the book and movie, Voyage of the Damned, based on an actual attempt to rescue Jews, who were not allowed to disembark upon arrival in Cuba or in the United States. The Nazis had allowed the ship to make the attempt as a propaganda exercise, confident that this country would not accept Jewish refugees.\n\nThe Shoah brought out the worst in humanity. Hitler\u2019s conflation of the Jewish religion with \u201crace\u201d was not particularly controversial among the Allies. Noses rubbed in the result, we now lionize Oskar Schindler and teachers illustrate situational ethics by asking if it would be ethical to lie with the SS at the door asking \u201cHave you seen any Jews?\u201d\n\nThe Shoah also brought out the best in humanity. Britain had a program called Kindertransport, under which Jewish children could be admitted if they had a host family and a guaranteed return ticket. Sir Nickolas Winton exploited Kindertransport to rescue 669 children from Czechoslovakia ahead of the Nazi onslaught. Never has an honorary knighthood been more appropriate. R.I.P.\n\nNew York Governor Andrew Cuomo (D) interviewed on Morning Joe, opined that the marriage equality debate has been misunderstood. \u201cIt\u2019s not about the marriage; it\u2019s about the equality.\u201d My cousin Ray Sixkiller mused, \u201cThat\u2019s exactly how the bigots understand it.

Ted Cruz, told Sean Hannity that the Supreme Court decision failing to strike down Obamacare over a drafting error, \u201csome of the darkest 24 hours in our nation\u2019s history.\u201d Cousin Ray, never missing a chance for a shot at Cruz, deadpanned, \u201cFrom his point of view, this is the worst thing the SCOTUS has done since Brown v.
