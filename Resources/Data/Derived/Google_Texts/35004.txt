About 25 people gathered Saturday outside the Dallas County Jail to protest the death of Joseph Hutcheson, who died earlier this month after being restrained by sheriff’s deputies.

Sheriff’s officials said the peaceful crowd held a prayer vigil around 11 a.m. outside the lobby. About four people said a prayer inside the lobby, officials said.

Hutcheson, 48, lost consciousness and died in the lobby while in custody on Aug. 1. He had run into the building yelling that his wife was trying to hurt him, said Raul Reyna, a Dallas County sheriff’s spokesman.

The family has demanded Dallas County Sheriff Lupe Valdez release any videos of the incident and fire any deputies involved.

The case remains under investigation.
