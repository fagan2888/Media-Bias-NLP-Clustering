The justices were trying to determine whether the law makes people in all 50 states eligible for federal tax subsidies to cut the cost of insurance premiums. Opponents say that only residents of states that set up their own insurance markets can get federal subsidies to help pay the premiums.\n\nRoughly three dozen states did not set up their own exchanges and rely on the federal healthcare.gov. The Obama administration says it would make no sense to condition subsidies on where people live, and that doing so would set off a \"death spiral\" in which enrollment declines, driving premiums up and leaving only the sickest, and costliest, people insured.\n\nIn Alabama, 145,763 citizens obtained coverage through the Affordable Care Act this year, and 132,253 received subsidies. Insurance premiums will increase by an average of 321 percent for those who lose subsidies after the decision. Alabama has one of the highest percentages of consumers receiving subsidies, and some of the lowest prices for insurance on the exchange.\n\nIf the court rules against the subsidies, two-thirds of those who bought coverage using the tax credits are expected to drop the insurance.\n\nSome states are already creating back-up plans to save the subsidies if the court rules against the administration. Leaders in Pennsylvania and Delaware have created plans to fast-track approval of state-based exchanges that piggyback on Healthcare.gov, the federal exchange.\n\nBut in Alabama, which has rejected several elements of the law \u2013 including Medicaid expansion and the creation of an exchange \u2013 it may not be so easy to get a plan in place.\n\n\"One of the prerequisites is that a state has to want to be a state-based exchange, and several states have laws on the books that prevent that,\" said Cynthia Cox, associate director of health reform and private insurance at the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nStill, lawmakers aren't eager to take the subsidies away. Support for the Affordable Care Act surpassed opposition earlier this year, according to a poll conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nGOP contingency plans in Congress would restore the subsidies, but remove requirements that individuals or businesses purchase insurance plans. Those changes would critically undermine the healthcare law and could face resistance from the insurance industry, Cox said.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Elena Kagan, John Roberts, Anthony Kennedy, affordable care act, obamacare, news", "title": "More than 130,000 in Alabama could lose subsidies in Obamacare decision", "og": {"site_name": "AL.com", "description": "If the Supreme Court rules against the Obama administration, 132,253 people in Alabama will lose subsidies that make insurance affordable.
