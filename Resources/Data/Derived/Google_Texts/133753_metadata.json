If the addict stops using, he'll go through a world of hurt: depression, nausea, jitteriness and extreme flu-like symptoms.\n\nMost addicts can't bear the symptoms, so they keep getting more heroin.\n\nThose with money have the means to fund their death spiral. The odds are that they'll keep buying more heroin until they finally overdose fatally \u2014 as happened to actor Philip Seymour Hoffman a year and a half ago.\n\nThose who lack the funds frequently steal from family members or break into homes and businesses to fund their next fix \u2014 a bank a half-mile from my suburban home has been robbed four times in the past 18 months by heroin-addicted young men.\n\nThe only hope for all addicts is that they get professional counseling and make it through a few weeks of painful detox. Even under the best-case scenario, they will be addicts for life.\n\n\u201cThe mental addiction to opiates will be there forever, and relapse is not uncommon,\u201d said Gentile.\n\nThose who fail to make it through detox \u2014 or relapse after detox \u2014 face dire consequences. In 2012, Allegheny County had 288 overdose deaths \u2014 well up from 22 in 1984. The Allegheny County Medical Examiner's Office estimates that the number has jumped 25 percent in the past few years. USA Today reports that the U.S. suffers more than 44,000 fatal heroin overdoses every year.\n\nSo, how do we address this epidemic?\n\nPhysicians need to be better educated on the risks involved when prescribing pain medication. It would be helpful, too, to establish a central prescription repository, so that patients will be flagged if they attempt to get multiple pain medications from several doctors.\n\nPatients need to be aware of the incredibly addictive elements of prescription pain medication. Just because they are prescribed by a medical doctor does not mean they are worry-free. Patients should be wary of prescription pain medication and use it with extreme caution.\n\nMost importantly, if you are at a party and someone offers heroin to you, leave. It is possible to become an addict the very first time heroin is used.\n\nTo those who think they can use this incredibly addictive and destructive drug in a recreational manner, Gentile offered words of wisdom from a recovering addict he knows:\n\n\u201cIf your mind is weak enough to try heroin, your body is weak enough to become addicted to it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "There were so many people buying breakfast bags of heroin from street dealers one Philadelphia morning, the traffic came to a standstill  and the dealers cursed at anyone who dared honk..05/26/2016 19:32:29PM EST.", "author": "Tom Purcell", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "There were so many people buying breakfast bags of heroin from street dealers one Philadelphia morning, the traffic came to a standstill  and the dealers cursed at anyone who dared honk.", "title": "- America\u2019s Heroin Epidemic", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/tompurcell/2015/08/24/americas-heroin-epidemic-n2043002", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/167/59553735-febb-47a4-905a-94b28cb8e14d.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "There were so many people buying breakfast bags of heroin from street dealers one Philadelphia morning, the traffic came to a standstill  and the dealers cursed at anyone who dared honk.", "title": "- America\u2019s Heroin Epidemic", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/tompurcell/2015/08/24/americas-heroin-epidemic-n2043002", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/167/59553735-febb-47a4-905a-94b28cb8e14d.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "America\u2019s Heroin Epidemic, Tom Purcell, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "So recounted Lou Gentile, a former undercover operative for the Pennsylvania State Police Organized Crime Unit, as he told me about the pervasiveness of America's heroin epidemic.\n\u201cThey switch because street heroin is easier to source and significantly less expensive,\u201d said Gentile.\nPatients should be wary of prescription pain medication and use it with extreme caution.\nPatients need to be aware of the incredibly addictive elements of prescription pain medication.\n\u201cIn the past, heroin addicts tended to be street users who stood on street corners in impoverished areas,\u201d said Gentile, now CEO and founder of CSI Corporate Security & Investigations in Monaca."}
