In March 2012, the city council there changed its policies to allow short-term rentals \u2014 defined as rentals of less than 30 days \u2014 for any property owner who got a license, paid taxes on rental revenues and designated a local representative to deal with problems such as noise and trash, according the Daily News.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe city also brought in a company called VR Compliance to scour the Internet for Aspen vacation rentals and compare them to local licenses.\n\nSince then, an additional 30 property owners have registered with the city \u2014 15 as a result of identification by VR Compliance \u2014 bringing the total to 61. Those 30 additional rentals brought in $73,000 in 2013.\n\nAspen Finance Director Don Taylor said the costs to the city of the contract with VR Compliance is \"nominal,\" and while the extra revenue might not be much in Boulder, it's a lot to Aspen.\n\nHowever, he noted that some Aspen vacation rentals go for substantial sums, meaning the tax revenue off a small number of properties is also significant.\n\nThe issue of compliance was also an important one, he said.\n\n\"We had a long public process about whether to enforce zoning or loosen standards, and a decision was made to allow the rentals with some compliance overlay,\" he said. \"People were doing it in a bandit kind of way, and once that was out of the way, we got a lot of voluntary compliance.\"\n\nAt the same time, Taylor said Boulder might not want to take Aspen's liberal approach to vacation rentals.\n\n\"We are a resort town,\" he said. \"We live this every day. I'm not sure how a residential neighborhood in a city like Boulder might feel about this.\"\n\nIn the past, Boulder Finance Director Bob Eichem has said the cost of identifying vacation rentals would cancel out any additional revenue raised by taxing them, though he agrees their open operation in residential zones raises compliance questions.\n\nAspen's experience raises the possibility of identifying more vacation rentals for a relatively small cost, but the question of how to tax something that is illegal remains.\n\nSeveral Boulder City Council members said at a study session this week that they would like the city to look at requiring registration and then taxing vacation rentals.\n\nCity Manager Jane Brautigam said she will include a tax on vacation rentals on a list of possible November ballot measures she'll present to the council in April.\n\nThe city already has a lodging tax of 7.5 percent on hotel and motel room rentals that theoretically could apply to vacation rentals, but to avoid any possibility of a challenge under Colorado's Taxpayer Bill of Rights, Brautigam said she would recommend asking voters to approve a new tax.\n\nCity officials could then consider whether to allow vacation rentals in some areas.\n\nBoulder Mayor Matt Appelbaum said it's a difficult question, but the city can't keep ignoring widespread violations of its rules.\n\n\"A pretty significant amount of this is going on already, legal or not,\" he said. \"At a certain point, you either have to accept that something is going on and crack down on it, or you manage it the best you can and make sure it's licensed and deal with nuisance factors.\"\n\nCity Councilman Macon Cowles, who has frequently raised the matter of unlicensed vacation rentals, said there are numerous issues, starting with the safety of guests staying in homes that have never been inspected the way that hotels and motels are inspected.\n\nThere's also an equity issue with Boulder's hotels, which have to pay the lodging tax, and a question of neighborhood impact, whether from parking, noise or a constant influx of strangers.\n\nCowles said vacation rentals may also be inflating home prices and taking homes out of the general rental market because vacation rentals that are consistently rented generate a lot more revenue.\n\nCowles said he would like the city to study the impacts.\n\nMary Ann Mahoney, executive director of the Boulder Convention and Visitors Bureau, said her organization has been concerned about vacation rentals for a long time and would like the city to take the matter on.\n\n\"Hotels have to pay taxes and be inspected by their insurance adjuster for safety, and there are a lot of costs associated with that that the vacation rentals don't have to take on,\" she said. \"There is also the residents' sensitivity. They might want to know if there is a nightly rental down the street.\"\n\nAppelbaum said he doesn't know what the right policy is yet, but the issue isn't going away.\n\n\"Whatever we end up doing has to better reflect reality,\" he said.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_25148463/boulder-takes-new-look-at-vacation-rentals", "sailthru.author": "By Erica Meltzer ,  Camera Staff Writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:25148463:view"}, "startDate": "2014-02-16T15:00:00-0700", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "Boulder voters might be asked to approve a lodging tax on vacation rentals this November, though so far the practice remains illegal in all residential zones in the city.", "title": "Boulder takes new look at vacation rentals", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_25148463/boulder-takes-new-look-at-vacation-rentals", "image": "http://local.dailycamera.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/dailycamera.png", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "modificationDate": "2014-02-15T17:16:40-0700", "endDate": "2024-02-16T16:02:43-0700", "news_keywords": "Boulder News, Boulder News news, Boulder Colorado Boulder News news, Boulder Colorado news, Boulder News Boulder news, Boulder News Colorado news, US Boulder News news, world Boulder News news.", "byline": "By Erica Meltzer,", "pubDate": "2014-02-14T22:00:58-0700", "sailthru.date": "2014-02-16T15:00:00-0700", "sailthru.title": "Boulder takes new look at vacation rentals", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.section": "Boulder News", "description": "Boulder voters might be asked to approve a lodging tax on vacation rentals this November, though so far the practice remains illegal in all residential zones in the city.", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_25148463/boulder-takes-new-look-at-vacation-rentals", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "Boulder voters might be asked to approve a lodging tax on vacation rentals this November, though so far the practice remains illegal in all residential zones in the city.", "title": "Boulder takes new look at vacation rentals"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd239\"", "article_summary": "Several Boulder City Council members said at a study session this week that they would like the city to look at requiring registration and then taxing vacation rentals.\nCowles said vacation rentals may also be inflating home prices and taking homes out of the general rental market because vacation rentals that are consistently rented generate a lot more revenue.\nAt the same time, Taylor said Boulder might not want to take Aspen's liberal approach to vacation rentals.\nCity Council members, though, are paying close attention to the efforts of mountain towns to get a handle on their vacation rentals.\nCity officials could then consider whether to allow vacation rentals in some areas."}
