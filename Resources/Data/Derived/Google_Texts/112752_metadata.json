One wrong move and someone will surely explode over mention of Ferguson, same-sex marriage, or (gasp), Obamacare. While you wait for your crazy Aunt Bonnie to finish defending her racism over a plate of mashed potatoes, have another glass of Chardonnay and give thanks for these tweets that say everything you're thinking.\n\nWhy did the Fergusson decision have to come down 2 days before I have to make conversation with my parents for 4 days? \u2014 Guy Branum (@guybranum) November 25, 2014\n\nWaiting until everyone takes their first succulent bite of turkey to yell, \"You're all racist\" and storm out. \u2014 Louis Virtel (@louisvirtel) November 28, 2014\n\nMissed Connection: My mother. \u2014 Warren Holstein (@WarrenHolstein) November 29, 2014\n\nHappy Thanksgiving to everyone who still thinks it's safe to mix Tryptophan, alcohol & relatives. \u2014 John Fugelsang (@JohnFugelsang) November 27, 2014\n\nHappy Family Apology Day! \u2014 Paula Pell (@perlapell) November 28, 2014\n\nTo control the appetite on #Thanksgiving try drinking a full glass of water before the meal or ask my relatives to discuss race in America. \u2014 Danny Z\u00fcker (@DannyZuker) November 27, 2014\n\nThe turkey is dry and overcooked. THANKS, OBAMA!!!! \u2014 Top Conservative Cat (@TeaPartyCat) November 27, 2014\n\nCan't wait to go to my hometown bars tonight and see which Bruce Springsteen song everyone turned into. \u2014 Louis Virtel (@louisvirtel) November 27, 2014\n\nFeel free to ignore your family until Christmas.
