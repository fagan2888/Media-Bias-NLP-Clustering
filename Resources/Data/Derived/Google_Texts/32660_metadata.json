Sophie is now 31 but still has the intellectual capacity of a three-year-old. There were no concerns about drugs or boyfriends and no chance of having \u201cthe talk\u201d about sex with her. The hardest part for Sophie\u2019s Sydney-based parents was managing her periods. \u201cShe has an older sister and a younger sister and we tried to get her to use pads, but it just didn\u2019t work,\u201d said Merren Carter, Sophie\u2019s mother. \u201cPeople talk about stigma associated with menstruation but there was none of that at our house. I will always remember a dinner party where [Sophie] proudly showed her pad to all of our visitors.\u201d Merren and her husband, John Carter, put Sophie on Depo Provera birth control for five years. However, John, an endocrinologist and professor of medicine at the University of Sydney was concerned about the long-term risks of osteoporosis associated with the hormonal contraception. They began looking for an alternative solution. At first they considered endometrial ablation, a procedure that destroys the lining of the uterus, and reduces menstrual flow. They received approval from the Guardianship Tribunal of New South Wales, a governmental body that determines consent for special medical treatments for adults who are incapable of making their own decisions.\n\nHowever, the Carters decided not to go ahead with the procedure as it would have to be repeated. Instead they applied for Sophie to have a hysterectomy. The Guardianship Tribunal approved it and when Sophie was 21 she had the operation. Her limited independence is no longer compromised by menstruation, Merren said. Sophie continues to take swimming lessons without monthly interruptions and doesn\u2019t have to have pap smears, under general anesthetic, which many of Sophie\u2019s friends have to endure. The Carters consider themselves lucky. The Guardianship Tribunal concluded that the potential distress to Sophie\u2019s spiritual, mental, and physical health caused by menstruation justified the procedure. However, many of Sophie\u2019s mentally handicapped friends have had similar applications rejected and some have gone overseas, to New Zealand or Thailand, for hysterectomies. The committee said that it \"abhors\" suggestions that sterilization should be used to manage pregnancy risks due to sexual abuse. It is likely to get even more difficult for Australian parents in situations like the Carters\u2019 to get approval for sterilizing a disabled child. A July Senate committee report recommended that sterilizing disabled children without their consent should be banned unless it can be proven that the child is never likely to develop the capacity for consent. The report also recommended that taking children or attempting to take children overseas for a sterilization procedure should be a criminal offense. The report followed a 10-month inquiry, with submissions from parents, carers, human rights groups, and disability advocates. The committee\u2019s list of 28 recommendations include that the definition of an individual\u2019s capacity to consent be identical in every Australian state and territory, and that sex education information be targeted at the disability sector. In one of the recommendations, the committee said that it \u201cabhors\u201d suggestions that sterilization should be used to manage pregnancy risks due to sexual abuse. Sterilizing disabled people exudes more than a whiff of eugenics. It recalls U.S. policies in the 20th Century that led to the sterilization of more than 60,000 people by 1960, as well as the infamous Nazi \u201cLaw for the Prevention of Offspring with Hereditary Diseases,\u201d in 1933. But due to difficulty with menstrual management or a fear of pregnancy, carers often feel that sterilization is their only option. A 2003 study in the journal Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities Research Reviews about the ethics of involuntary sterilization of mentally handicapped people examined surveys from the 1980s and 1990s and found that roughly half of all parents with mentally disabled children have considered or would consider sterilizing their child. These decisions are often controversial. The 2006 Seattle \u201cAshley Treatment\u201d case, in which a hysterectomy, among other procedures, was used to stunt the growth of a six-year-old girl, who had static encephalopathy, is still contentious. Her parents decided on these treatments to ease the burden of caring for her. \u201cMost parents have mixed motives,\u201d said Douglas Diekema, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Washington and Seattle Children's Hospital, who wrote the study. \u201cClearly many of them do want some help with menstrual control, but they really, almost all of the time desperately want their child never to get pregnant\u2026 They are concerned about sexual abuse and their child been taken advantage of. Although a sterilizing procedure doesn\u2019t do anything to alter that possibility, what it does do is that it prevents, in their mind, a pregnancy on top of that.\u201d U.S. laws also vary from state to state. Diekema says that, generally, getting approval for the procedure is \u201cfairly restrictive\u201d throughout the country. Much like in Australia, the rate at which sterilization in disabled populations occurs is unknown. At the Seattle Children\u2019s Hospital, Diekema says one or two procedures are approved a year. Carolyn West, a fellow of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians and professional member of the New South Wales Guardianship Tribunal, said that approximately one to three procedures are approved yearly in the state. See Also Thinking About Pregnancy Like an Economist One of the committee\u2019s recommendations is to record the number of child sterilization cases in Australia \u201cin the same way in each jurisdiction.\u201d Even though the exact number of procedures are hazy, the figures seem to have been high enough to have caught the attention of the United Nations, which in its 2012 Conventions on the Rights of the Child Report, wrote that they were \u201cparticularly concerned\u201d that the sterilization of disabled women and girls continues in Australia and advised that the practice be banned for non-therapeutic purposes. The United Nations Special Rapporteur on torture has highlighted that forced sterilization of disabled women may constitute torture, or ill treatment. Submissions to the Australian Senate inquiry detailed some distressing instances of forced sterilization. One woman\u2019s father, who believed that she should not have children, told her she was going to the hospital to have her tonsils taken out. \u201cI did not have a sore throat afterwards,\u201d she told the committee. It was only when she was trying to have kids with a long-term partner that she had realized what happened. Her partner eventually left her because he wanted children. Another woman was forced to have a hysterectomy by her parents, even though she told them that she did not want to have the operation. Another disabled woman who was sterilized collected more than 100 strollers, as well as diapers, toys, and clothes for children that she would never have. Stella Young, a comedian and disability advocate who suffers from osteogenesis imperfecta, a congenital bone disorder, wrote in her submission that a specialist tried to convince her parents that a hysterectomy would be best for her, to avoid the \u201cinconvenience\u201d of menstruation. Young was just four years old at the time. \u201cMy parents, to whom I\u2019m eternally grateful, were horrified and rejected this \u2018advice,\u2019\u201d Young wrote.\n\nBut menstrual management played a big role in many submissions by parents and carers. One grandmother wrote that her granddaughter will not be able to manage her periods, when she starts menstruating, as she often \u201cfinger paints\u201d with and \u201csmears\u201d the contents of her diapers. One submission described how a woman remained in the bathroom at her place of employment with blood on her clothes due to the onset of her period. West said that the New South Wales Guardianship Tribunal will not approve a sterilization procedure for menstrual management or contraception except in life-threatening cases, or when there is a significant risk of harm to the health of the disabled person. For instance, if the bleeding leads to anemia, or if the hysterectomy is part of a cancer treatment. Instead the tribunal recommends using other methods of contraception. For some disabled people, intrauterine devices, may need to be inserted under a general anesthetic, and those who take the contraceptive pill may have breakthrough bleeds. In Sophie Carter\u2019s case, her parents successfully argued that they did not want to expose her to long-term risks associated with Depo Provera. \"Advocates who say she has the 'right' to have a child need to factor in her ability to be RESPONSIBLE for that child.\" \u201cThere are no methods of menstrual regulation or fertility regulation that are perfect, and there will be girls and women in whom specific methods are unsuitable. Alternatively there are a very small number who may have their best interests served with a hysterectomy and sterilization,\u201d said Michael Permezel, the president elect of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RANZCOG). Then there are the parents who believe their children are entitled to a sex life but are not necessarily capable of having children. In another submission, one woman describes how her 27-year-old daughter has a boyfriend but if she were to get pregnant, the child would be \u201cdead within a week.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Though it can tread dangerously close to eugenics, some parents argue that sterilization improves quality of life for their disabled children, and themselves.", "author": "Marina Kamenev", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "Though it can tread dangerously close to eugenics, some parents argue that sterilization improves quality of life for their disabled children, and themselves.", "title": "Sterilizing a Child, for a Better Life", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2013/09/rtr35wtt/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/09/sterilizing-a-child-for-a-better-life/279765/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbbdc\"", "article_summary": "It is likely to get even more difficult for Australian parents in situations like the Carters\u2019 to get approval for sterilizing a disabled child.\n\"Advocates who say she has the 'right' to have a child need to factor in her ability to be RESPONSIBLE for that child.\"\nA July Senate committee report recommended that sterilizing disabled children without their consent should be banned unless it can be proven that the child is never likely to develop the capacity for consent.\nThe report also recommended that taking children or attempting to take children overseas for a sterilization procedure should be a criminal offense.\nThen there are the parents who believe their children are entitled to a sex life but are not necessarily capable of having children."}
