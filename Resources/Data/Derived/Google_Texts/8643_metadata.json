Bill Lackey/Staff\n\nBy Andrew McGinn\n\nStaff Writer\n\nFrom the time he was 16, when he became a lifeguard at his hometown YMCA in Youngstown, Paul Weber knew he\u2019d never get bored working at the Y.\n\nThat\u2019s held true \u2014 at 51, he\u2019s been employed by a YMCA somewhere ever since.\n\nWith Weber\u2019s hire late this summer as CEO of the Springfield Family YMCA, he\u2019s in charge of his own Y for the first time.\n\nThe opportunity to lead what\u2019s believed to be the second-oldest YMCA in Ohio was actually the big draw for a man who believes wholeheartedly in the movement started nearly 170 years ago as the Young Men\u2019s Christian Association.\n\nDuring a recent interview, he was quick to marvel at the fact that Springfield\u2019s YMCA will celebrate its 160th anniversary in 2014, making it among the oldest YMCAs in the U.S.\n\n\u201cThat was an attractive and interesting piece of me coming here,\u201d Weber said.\n\nBut, despite its storied past, Weber wants to give the Springfield Family YMCA a brighter future than it has at present.\n\nThe facility\u2019s run of five CEOs in three years \u2014 Weber is No. 6 \u2014 resulted at one point in a $29,000 drop in United Way funding. On top of that, the roof still leaks.\n\n\u201cThe change in leadership is unsettling for folks,\u201d Weber explained, sitting below a water-stained ceiling tile in his office.\n\nWeber\u2019s immediate plans are to give the facility, located at 300 S. Limestone St., a blitzkrieg makeover later this month in the vein of TV\u2019s \u201cExtreme Home Makeover.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis Y\u2019s got really good bones,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just needs some leadership from someone who\u2019s been in the movement for 30-plus years.\u201d\n\nHe also wants to grow the facility\u2019s collaborative ties to other local organizations.\n\nAnd, now that the Affordable Care Act is being implemented, Weber envisions the YMCA helping people lower future insurance costs by focusing on preventative health issues.\n\n\u201cWhen there\u2019s one Y in a town,\u201d he said, \u201cthere\u2019s so much potential there.\u201d\n\nWeber last served as district vice president at the YMCA of Central Ohio in Columbus, where he oversaw four branches with 22,000 members and a budget of $8 million.\n\nIn all, the YMCA of Central Ohio has 14 facilities, 60 child care sites and two campsites, he said.\n\nBy comparison, the Springfield Family YMCA has little more than 4,000 total members, a budget of $1.4 million and one building.\n\nLowell Nees, interim CEO locally before Weber\u2019s arrival, told the Springfield News-Sun this summer that Weber is well-suited to meet the local Y\u2019s challenges.\n\n\u201cThe responsibilities here will include strategic planning and establishing what needs to be done,\u201d he said, \u201cand what directions the YMCA wants to take.\u201d\n\nWeber also came to Springfield in part because it reminds him a little of his hometown, he said. It was there that he found his calling at the local Y.\n\n\u201cIt was everything to me,\u201d he said.\n\nA graduate of Youngstown State University, he went on to work at YMCAs in Wooster, Des Moines, Iowa, and Austin, Texas.\n\nThe YMCA in Austin, in particular, had an interesting mix of members, including former Texas Gov. Ann Richards, during Weber\u2019s tenure.\n\nAustin\u2019s most colorful resident, Willie Nelson, was also a member. Weber only saw him work out a few times.\n\n\u201cThat was ugly,\u201d he said with a laugh.", "article_metadata": {"description": "From the time he was 16, when he became a lifeguard at his hometown YMCA in Youngstown, Paul Weber knew he\u2019d never get bored working at the Y.", "og": {"url": "http://www.springfieldnewssun.com/news/news/local/new-ymca-ceo-settles-in/nbF8L/", "image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2013/10/04/b3/4e/100613-YMCA.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "From the time he was 16, when he became a lifeguard at his hometown YMCA in Youngstown, Paul Weber knew he\u2019d never get bored working at the Y.", "title": "New YMCA CEO settles in"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/resize/120x120/img/photos/2013/10/04/b3/4e/100613-YMCA.jpg", "description": "From the time he was 16, when he became a lifeguard at his hometown YMCA in Youngstown, Paul Weber knew he\u2019d never get bored working at the Y.", "site": "@springfieldnews", "card": "summary", "title": "New YMCA CEO settles in"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "springfieldnewssun", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.springfieldnewssun.com/news/news/local/new-ymca-ceo-settles-in/nbF8L/"}, "cmg_revpath": "/re/292/2085210/news/news/local/new-ymca-ceo-settles-in/nbF8L/", "keywords": "springfield,SNShptop,SNShomepage,local,community", "google-site-verification": "8vJEEijbdFqCz5Jlhv2SIUUb093Tw1ZWl6RD1VU7ZsU", "news_keywords": "springfield,SNShptop,SNShomepage,local,community"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc705\"", "article_summary": "But, despite its storied past, Weber wants to give the Springfield Family YMCA a brighter future than it has at present.\nBy comparison, the Springfield Family YMCA has little more than 4,000 total members, a budget of $1.4 million and one building.\nWith Weber\u2019s hire late this summer as CEO of the Springfield Family YMCA, he\u2019s in charge of his own Y for the first time.\nPaul Weber, the new CEO of the Springfield Family YMCA.\nIn all, the YMCA of Central Ohio has 14 facilities, 60 child care sites and two campsites, he said."}
