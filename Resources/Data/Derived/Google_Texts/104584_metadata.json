There, outnumbered Democrats \u2014 and even some Republicans \u2014 spent hours taking maximum time to debate seemingly minor bills in a bid to kill scores more, including measures on gay marriage, abortion and Shariah law.\n\nThe practice, a tradition known in the Capitol as \u201cchubbing,\u201d imperiled the measures because midnight Thursday was the deadline for the House to tentatively pass its own bills.\n\nOn the big issues that could blow up the session, much of the action took place behind the scenes. There were outward signs, though, as four bills linked to a grand compromise became unstuck Thursday. Gov. Greg Abbott, who has monitored the negotiations, told reporters that he hopes for a tax-cut agreement within 24 hours.\n\nLt. Gov. Dan Patrick and Speaker Joe Straus have largely talked past one another all year, culminating in a blow-up at a weekly breakfast session late last month. So, the hard task of finding an exit strategy fell to two senators and two House allies of Straus.\n\nThey have spent days trying to end a weeks-long impasse on tax cuts and several unrelated issues, such as guns and law enforcement along the Texas-Mexico border. While the two chambers have some differences on those matters, the biggest obstacles to a deal appeared to be pride of authorship and bragging rights about whose bill eventually passes.\n\n\u201cIf we can get some resolve on all those moving parts, I think we can get there,\u201d said Sen. Kevin Eltife of Tyler, a moderate-conservative Republican from Tyler who has emerged as a lead Senate negotiator.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re close to an agreement on tax cuts,\u201d Eltife said after he and Senate GOP Caucus Chairman Kelly Hancock of North Richland Hills left a meeting on the House side of the Capitol. \u201cIt\u2019s still in flux. \u2026 We\u2019re working on all options, but we\u2019re close.\u201d\n\nThe chambers have been far apart on taxes for months. Both want to slash the \u201cfranchise tax\u201d that businesses pay. But the Senate favored cutting homeowners\u2019 property taxes, while the House has strongly backed cutting the state sales tax for the first time in Texas history.\n\nThe emerging compromise would give the House its slightly larger version of the business tax cut and the Senate part of its property break. The sales tax would remain unchanged.\n\nDay of contrasts\n\nThe flurry of behind-the-scenes deal-making contrasted with the slow grind on the House floor, as Democrats tried to run out the legislative clock.\n\nRep. Ken Sheets, R-Dallas, described the Democrats\u2019 chubbing tactic as the \u201cpractice of utilizing Texas House procedure, rules and the back mike to delay the clock.\u201d The term\u2019s origin is disputed, but it\u2019s a point of pride for some.\n\n\u201cMr. Speaker, I would like to speak On, For, and Against the bill,\u201d Rep. Terry Canales, D-Edinburg, wrote proudly on Twitter with the hash tags \u201c#chub\u201d and \u201c#billbutcher.\u201d\n\nDemocrats\u2019 chief target was a bill that would stop county clerks from issuing a marriage license to a same-sex couple or recognizing such a marriage from another state \u2014 even if the U.S. Supreme Court rules otherwise.\n\nBut they also were motivated by other bills down the calendar on human trafficking training for personnel at abortion clinics, limiting Obamacare exchange-issued coverage of abortions, making sure Texas courts don\u2019t recognize Shariah law and letting clergy refuse to conduct gay weddings.\n\nBy 10 p.m. Thursday, with just two hours left, there were 35 bills on the House calendar ahead of Magnolia GOP Rep. Cecil Bell\u2019s marriage license bill. By that time, the House was disposing of only four bills an hour.\n\nDemocrats weren\u2019t the only ones stalling. Republicans also clogged up the process, wasting hours of debate this week on minor bills that ultimately failed.\n\nOutside the chamber, though, negotiators were working assiduously to complete a deal, said Rep. Charlie Geren, a Fort Worth Republican who is part of Straus\u2019 leadership team.\n\nOn Thursday, the Senate Finance Committee largely gutted but advanced a House-passed bill on taxes and fees dedicated to specific purposes.\n\nThat\u2019s an important component of a grand compromise, as it shows continuing commitment to greater budget transparency, a House priority, said Rep. Drew Darby, R-San Angelo, the bill\u2019s author.\n\nBy repealing $339 million of occupational fees, the House-passed bill also would help bring the price tag of the tax-cut package to about $4.2 billion, he noted.\n\nBoth the House and Senate passed costlier tax relief plans. But the compromise would shave $850 million from the Senate package\u2019s two-year price tag of $4.45 billion. That\u2019s because it would offer a more modest increase in homestead exemptions on school property taxes \u2014 taking the exemptions, now $15,000, to $25,000. The Senate wanted $33,250 next year and $34,913 in 2017.\n\nEltife and the House\u2019s other lead negotiator, Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dennis Bonnen, would not discuss details of the tax deal.\n\n\u201cWe are having positive conversations,\u201d said Bonnen, an Angleton Republican. \u201cEvery time we have another positive conversation, we come closer to an agreement.\u201d\n\nGun issues\n\nOn guns, there also were signs of a thaw.\n\nThe House Homeland Security and Public Safety Committee approved a Senate-passed campus carry bill to allow licensed Texans to carry concealed handguns in most state university buildings. Meanwhile, the Senate State Affairs panel scheduled a Monday hearing on the House-passed open carry bill. It would let Texans with the appropriate license carry handguns openly in a shoulder or belt holster.\n\nBonnen and Sen. Brian Birdwell, R-Granbury, huddled to work out differences on their border security bills, Eltife said.\n\nBirdwell, who heads a Senate subcommittee on border security, scheduled a hearing on Bonnen\u2019s House-passed bill for Monday.\n\nEltife said other issues that are part of the session-ending compromise include how to carry out the chambers\u2019 agreement that a public corruption prosecutorial unit should be stripped from heavily Democratic Travis County and a Senate-passed requirement that at least 60 percent of a local governing body support any increase in property tax revenue.\n\nThe senator said plans to boost highway funding without raising taxes are a separate set of negotiations, though they are proceeding smoothly.\n\nBonnen said \u201cthere are no deadlines\u201d for wrapping up the endgame talks. He acknowledged the movement on the bills on occupational fees, guns and border security.\n\n\u201cWhat those are, are signs of important bills making progress in the system,\u201d he said.\n\nFollow Robert T.
