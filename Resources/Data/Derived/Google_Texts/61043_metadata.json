The group wrote, \u201c9 kids every day will never have another birthday\u201d on a chalkboard, displayed for all to see.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nAccording to PolitiFact Oregon, the real number from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) shows 7.81 deaths daily for those who fall under the Brady Campaign\u2019s \u201ckids\u201d age range. But the problem with that age range is that it includes 19-year-old adults.\n\nThe CDC\u2019s \u201cown metrics\u201d show that \u201cabout half of all youth gun deaths\u201d from 2007 to 2011 are for the age group of 18 to 19. And when \u201cunintentional\u201d firearm-related injuries are isolated, \u201croughly 46 percent\u201d is for the age group of 18 to 19, as well.\n\nRemove these and there is \u201can average of 4.76 unintentional gun [firearm] injuries each day and 3.85 [firearm-related] deaths.\u201d\n\nThe 3.85 number is considerably lower than the claim that 9 children are killed each day.\n\nPolitiFact Oregon contacted the Brady Campaign\u2019s Heidi Yewman about these figures, and \u201cshe acknowledged that the number presented at the Vancouver rally was incorrect.\u201d\n\nFollow AWR Hawkins on Twitter @AWRHawkins.
