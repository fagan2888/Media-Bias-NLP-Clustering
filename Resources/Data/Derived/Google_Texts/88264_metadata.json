It won\u2019t put anybody back to work, necessarily, but at least it will keep the Island boiling come election time, which promises to be anything but boring.\n\nRepublicans and their conservative super-PACS, whether run by Karl Rove or somebody of his ilk, have promised to spend millions of dollars to defeat the Democratic incumbent, Rep. Tim Bishop (D-Southampton), who\u2019s been representing New York\u2019s 1st Congressional District since 2003. They reportedly coughed up $4 million two years ago and lost. By the time that race was over, $10 million may have been spent by both sides. This fall\u2019s contest might cost even more, some observers predict.\n\nThe GOP believes Bishop is more vulnerable this time thanks to Obamacare. Their most likely contender, state Sen. Lee Zeldin (R-Shirley), has been hammering that message home repeatedly in his fundraising. But Zeldin still has to fend off a well-financed challenge from George Demos, a former U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission prosecutor who ran for Congress in the 2010 Republican primary before losing out to wealthy entrepreneur Randy Altschuler.\n\nThe headaches with the Affordable Care Act certainly are widely known now but local voters might be sick of hearing about them by November. House Republicans have already voted 47 times in vain to repeal Obamacare, but it\u2019s apparently the only issue they really want to run on, even if they can do nothing but complain about it.\n\nRice Rolls the Dice\n\nThanks to the recently announced retirement of Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, the race in New York\u2019s 4th Congressional District is suddenly wide-open this fall, but it may not be as heated as Bishop\u2019s contest out east if the popular Nassau County District Attorney Kathleen Rice is the Democratic candidate to replace her. McCarthy has been waging a long-running fight against the National Rifle Association over gun control, and on that issue Rice has pledged to follow in her footsteps.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve spent my career combating gun violence and advocating for families and communities in need,\u201d Rice said in a statement to the Press. \u201cI\u2019m running because we need more independent problem solvers in Congress who share these values and who care about people, not partisan politics.\u201d\n\nHer spokesman, Eric Phillips, said that Rice is \u201csomeone who can work well with Democrats and Republicans.\u201d\n\nOf all the Democrats running in Nassau last fall, Rice was the only one to win countywide. She trounced her Republican opponent by 18 points. But her relations with her Democratic Party chairman, Jay Jacobs, have soured recently over her refusal to bring criminal charges against former Nassau County Police Commissioner Thomas Dale for ordering the politically motivated arrest of a Roosevelt man who had testified against a long-shot county executive candidate.\n\n\u201cWe used to be very good and close friends,\u201d Jacobs tells the Press, adding that \u201cshe should win. She stands an excellent chance.\u201d Since Rice beat the longtime Republican incumbent, Denis Dillon, in 2005, Jacobs observed, \u201cshe has not had a competitive race.\u201d\n\nAt this point, Rice is not the official nominee for her party\u2014Nassau County Legislature Minority Leader Kevan Abrahams has also expressed an interest in the Congressional seat\u2014but the Republicans haven\u2019t made their pick, either. Topping their list was Hempstead Town Supervisor Kate Murray, who was being wooed by Nassau Republicans to enter the race but waited until early Friday evening before the Super Bowl to say she would not rise to the occasion and run for Congress.\n\nSo now the spotlight shifts to two Republican men reportedly interested in running but whom McCarthy had soundly beaten: Legis. Fran Becker Jr. of Lynbrook and attorney Frank Scaturro of New Hyde Park. In 2012, her victory margin was 30 points. Considering that Gov. Andrew Cuomo won the district with 63 percent of the vote in 2010 and that he\u2019ll be on the ballot this fall, the Republican candidate, no matter who he or she is, looks to be facing an uphill climb despite the home-court advantage of the vaunted Nassau Republican Machine.\n\nIt\u2019s a different dynamic in Suffolk\u2019s East End, where Bishop has more of a balancing act appeasing his constituents\u2014and his party.\n\nBishop to Crown\n\nInterestingly, Bishop and three other New Yorkers in swing districts were among the 39 House Democrats who crossed party lines late last year to vote for a Republican bill allowing health insurers to resume selling low-cost policies that have been cancelled because they didn\u2019t provide all the coverage required under the new law. That initiative grew out of President Obama\u2019s misguided promise that \u201cYou can keep your health insurance policy if you like it.\u201d As the conservative attack ads describe it: \u201cThey lied to you!\u201d\n\nPerhaps Bishop voted with the Republicans to inoculate himself from the negative campaign virus to come, but he explained it differently:\n\n\u201cThis was not a vote against the health reform law,\u201d Bishop told the Press in an email, \u201cbut a vote to ensure the intent of Congress when we passed it with a grandfather clause for existing plans. I, along with the President of the United States, said that people could keep their plan if they liked it, and for some people, that turned out not to be true. I voted for the bill because I stand by my statements, and this bill was a way to assist those that were losing their plans.\u201d\n\nNationally, Democrats hope they can change the subject and use the economy against their opponents, by drumming up support to raise the minimum wage, extend long-term unemployment insurance (this affects at least 10,000 Long Islanders) as well as enact immigration reform (and there are countless undocumented workers in the 1st District and elsewhere on the Island).\n\nStrange Bedfellows\n\nAnother factor to give the GOP pause this time around is that bipartisanship seems to be Cuomo\u2019s singular achievement in Albany, if you can believe the most powerful elected Republican in New York, state Senate co-leader Dean Skelos (R-Rockville Centre).\n\nAnd Skelos clearly has his hands full trying to keep state Senate Republicans in power\u2014especially since Zeldin is giving up his seat to run against Bishop and recently state Sen. Charles Fuschillo (R-Merrick) retired to take a job running a nonprofit. In 2012, President Obama carried both state Senate districts by more than 55 percent of the vote. Skelos is relying on a shaky coalition of Republicans and four members of the Independent Democratic Conference for support.\n\n\u201cHe is the co-majority leader now only because he has some dissident Democrats [voting with him],\u201d says Jacobs. \u201cHe does not have the senate majority!\u201d\n\nRight now, Legis. David Denenberg (D-Merrick) looks poised to run for Fuschillo\u2019s vacated seat in the 8th Senate District. Jacobs says that Denenberg \u201cis the most popular Democrat in that area\u201d and that he has bipartisan appeal.\n\nBut Skelos remains confident, his spokesman Scott Rief says, that his Long Island colleagues will all be Republicans, no matter whose names are on the November ballot, given that the last time Democrats ruled the Senate, they let New York City politicians shift school aid from the suburbs, impose an unpopular MTA commuter tax and take away the STAR rebate checks.\n\nJacobs concedes that the race to fill Zeldin\u2019s state Senate seat will be \u201ccompetitive.\u201d His counterpart in Suffolk County, Democratic Chairman Rich Schaffer, hasn\u2019t picked a candidate but the two leading contenders are Patchogue Mayor Paul Pontieri and Adrienne Esposito, the executive director of the Citizens Campaign for the Environment. On the Republican side, Brookhaven Councilman Tim Mazzei, former Assemblyman Dean Murray, Islip Town Board Member Anthony Senft and Islip Supervisor Tom Croci are being considered. A decision should be made by February\u2019s end, according to Jesse Garcia, Brookhaven Republican chairman.\n\nBy all accounts, Zeldin will make this Congressional race more competitive than he did in 2008 when Bishop trounced him by 16 percentage points (58 percent to 42 percent). In 2010, Zeldin parlayed suburban anger over the MTA payroll tax to oust the Democratic state senator, Brookhaven\u2019s popular former supervisor Brian Foley, and Zeldin has been staking out local positions on rolling back the Common Core Curriculum as well as repeating his opposition to the payroll tax that seem to resonate with his constituents.\n\nBut there\u2019s something about the East End district that attracts do-overs.\n\nThe 2012 race was a repeat between Bishop and millionaire entrepreneur Randy Altschuler, who had fallen 600 votes short in 2010. But two years later Altschuler lost more ground, losing by almost five percentage points, 52.4 to 47.5.\n\nThis time around, Zeldin has the blessing of the local party officials. But George Demos is not to be denied. He reportedly has $2 million in his coffers and has gotten the support of former Gov. George Pataki. By contrast Zeldin reported recently that he had $307,315 on hand, and Bishop said he had $565,456, according to their filings with the Federal Election Commission.\n\nDemos lost a Republican primary to Altschuler and he may not win the party\u2019s nod this year, either. But he certainly promises to be entertaining, if one of his recent 30-second campaign spots is any indication. It linked Bishop to President Obama and Toronto\u2019s crack-smoking mayor, Rob Ford, asking viewers if they\u2019re \u201ctired of politicians?\u201d Demos claims he\u2019s \u201cnot a politician.\u201d Few observers would dispute that.\n\nOne issue sure to be heard more about\u2014even though Bishop dealt with it two years ago\u2014is that the Office of Congressional Ethics was looking into whether the Congressman had helped hedge fund magnate Eric Semler get an environmental permit to launch fireworks at his son\u2019s bar mitzvah in exchange for a campaign donation.\n\n\u201cAfter the fact, after I got the permit, I did receive a request for a donation,\u201d Semler told Politico in August 2012. \u201cTim never said anything to me about a donation. I didn\u2019t know he was running for re-election\u2026I would love to support a guy like that.\u201d\n\nHow all these issues will play out in November remains to be seen.\n\nFor more of Senior Editor Spencer Rumsey\u2019s honest take on the vagaries of L.I. and national politics, the merits of single-malt scotch and Lindsay Lohan, check out his blog \u201cRumsey Punch.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Spencer Rumsey", "og": {"site_name": "Long Island News from the Long Island Press", "description": "Partisan politics will put Long Island voters in the crosshairs in 2014.", "title": "Long Island Will Be A Hotbed of Politics in 2014 - The Players, The Seats, The Stakes", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 420, "identifier": "https://www.longislandpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Screen-Shot-2014-02-05-at-5.02.24-PM.png", "height": 470}, "updated_time": "2014-02-05T17:06:46-04:00", "url": "https://www.longislandpress.com/2014/02/06/long-island-will-be-a-hotbed-of-politics-in-2014-the-players-the-seats-the-stakes/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Partisan politics will put Long Island voters in the crosshairs in 2014.", "title": "Long Island Will Be A Hotbed of Politics in 2014 - The Players, The Seats, The Stakes", "image": "https://www.longislandpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Screen-Shot-2014-02-05-at-5.02.24-PM.png", "creator": "@spencerbrumsey", "site": "@longislandpress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 122297088961}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/longislandpress", "section": "Featured News", "tag": "Tim Bishop", "published_time": "2014-02-06T09:00:36-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-05T17:06:46-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdeff3\"", "article_summary": "In 2012, President Obama carried both state Senate districts by more than 55 percent of the vote.\nDavid Denenberg (D-Merrick) looks poised to run for Fuschillo\u2019s vacated seat in the 8th Senate District.\nTheir most likely contender, state Sen.
