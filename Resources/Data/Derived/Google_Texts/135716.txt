* Via Steven Dennis, Congressional Republicans are using their noodles to come up with interesting legislative strategies:

Republicans in Congress are exploring a way to enact a repeal of Obamacare and other parts of their agenda soon after a new Republican president takes the oath of office in 2017. Several Republicans said they’re discussing the possibility of adopting a budget this year that would let the next president’s agenda — including top goals like repealing Obamacare — bypass a Democratic filibuster at the very start of the year. Republicans used a similar move early this year to send a bill repealing much of Obamacare and defunding Planned Parenthood to President Barack Obama, who vetoed it. The strategy would allow Republicans who control the House and Senate to put just such a bill on the desk of a new president if their party wins the White House, without having to grind through months of budget process. To succeed, Republicans need the Senate parliamentarian to let them use rules set by a budget resolution into the next Congress.

Just to be clear, this would mean immediately tossing tens of millions of people off their health coverage, bringing back denials for pre-existing conditions, and generally throwing the entire American health care system into chaos, while they then start to consider how they might go about “replacing” what they’ve repealed with some super-terrific new plan. The word “backlash” doesn’t even begin to describe what would ensue.

* And that’s not all the fun stuff that’s going on with congressional Republicans:

Congressional leaders thought last year’s two-year spending deal would pave the way for a simple budget season ahead of the election in November. They were wrong. The same group of conservatives that drove former House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) to resign amid a government spending fight last year are now threatening to rebel against the upcoming House Republican budget over $30 billion in spending that Boehner helped secure. They want current Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wisc.) to back out of the last year’s bipartisan agreement and reset spending targets at a lower level despite Ryan’s recent pleas for a more united party.

As I’ve said many times, for these people the substantive conservative goals they espouse aren’t really the point. The point is fighting. When you’re fighting you have purpose, you have direction, you have meaning. But waiting to fight another day? No fun at all.

* Via Natalie Jackson, there are no fewer than seven new polls out today of the Republican race in New Hampshire. I averaged their results, and here’s what they show: Trump 31, Rubio 16, Cruz 13, Kasich 11, Bush 9, Christie 5, Fiorina 4, Carson 3.

* The Democratic debate last night brought in 4.5 million viewers, which is not bad, except for the fact it was the least-watched debate of the campaign so far.

* Maggie Haberman reports on why Donald Trump’s uncompromising stance on immigration could find a ready audience in New Hampshire.

* Eric Bradner reports that in the past, Bernie Sanders has actually worked pretty hard bringing in money for Democrats from those “millionaires and billionaires,” and has also benefited from the party’s spending on his behalf.

* Rosalind Helderman has a good explainer on the ins and outs of whether Hillary Clinton can release the transcripts of her Wall Street speeches if she chooses to do so.

* Francis Wilkinson argues that Sanders threatens to pull the Democratic Party away from the rationalism and relative moderation that have characterized it of late, and turning it into a mirror image of the Republican Party.

* Dahlia Lithwick reports that the Supreme Court may finally take a case deciding whether it’s okay for states to ban assault weapons.

* Kevin Drum says the argument between Clinton and Sanders about who’s more progressive and who’s more electable is kind of silly, because we all know the answers to both questions.

* At The Week, I examined the Republican presidential candidates’ ongoing effort to alienate minority voters to the greatest extent possible.

* And Catherine Rampell explains the two big reasons Millennials love the 74-year-old Bernie Sanders.
