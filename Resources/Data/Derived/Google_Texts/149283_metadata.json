Marco Rubio has work himself to do with conservatives.\u201d\n\nAlthough Rubio has backed away from his previous work on the Gang of Eight immigration reform bill, he continues to support a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants after the southern border is secure.\n\nChristie suggested Rubio was a hypocrite for attacking him, citing a debate moment when the Florida Senator lectured former Florida Governor Jeb Bush for his negative campaigning.\n\n\u201cI just wonder what happened to the Marco who so indignantly looked at Jeb Bush and said, \u2018I guess someone must have convinced you that going negative against me helps you,\u2019\u201d he said in an interview on Bloomberg\u2019s With All Due Respect on Tuesday. \u201cI guess that same person must now have convinced Marco that going negative against Chris Christie is what he needs to do.\u201d\n\nConservative Solutions, the super PAC supporting Rubio, released two ads criticizing Christie\u2019s conservative credentials, highlighting Christie\u2019s appearance with President Obama after Hurricane Sandy and hitting him for expanding Medicaid under Obamacare.\n\n\u201cChris Christie could well be Obama\u2019s favorite Republican governor,\u201d one ad says, highlighting Christie\u2019s record in New Jersey. Another ad reminds voters of the \u201cBridgegate\u201d scandal in New Jersey, suggesting that a potential Christie presidency would be similar.\n\nWhen asked about the ads on the campaign trail, Rubio defended them as accurate.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t have another president that supports Common Core or gun control or expanding Obamacare,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Christie argued that Rubio\u2019s negative ads will fail.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t think Marco Rubio\u2019s going to be able to slime his way to the White House,\u201d Christie said in his interview with the Post. \u201cHe wants to put out a whole bunch of negative ads? Go ahead. I hope that he will acknowledge at some point that I couldn\u2019t care less.\u201d\n\nUPDATE:\n\nIn a statement to Breitbart News, Rubio spokesperson Alex Conant fired back at Christie for attacking a conservative instead of defending his own record.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s interesting that Gov. Christie would rather attack conservatives than defend his own record supporting common core, gun control and expanding Obamacare. If Christie was honestly \u2018telling it like it is\u2019, he would say there is nothing inaccurate about the new ads and stop attacking Marco.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "New Jersey Gov.
