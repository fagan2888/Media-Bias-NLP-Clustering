"Insurance companies and quite frankly, Obamacare insurance, is based on recommendations made by governmental agencies,” Dr. Eric Cubin, a Radiologist said.

According to the United States Preventive Task Force service, the new recommendation for women to get mammograms is biannually between the ages of 50 and 74.

Breast cancer is diagnosed in about 200,000 women every year and kills 40,000 and mammograms are designed to spot cancer early.

The Government Advisory Panel says they changed the age because women under 40 can come up with false positives so it's more beneficial at the age of 50.

There is debate over the new recommendations, with some radiologists saying it's starting too late. The American Cancer Society recommends starting mammograms at the age of 45 and getting them every year, but with the new recommendations it may not be covered under your insurance anymore.

"Insurance companies and quite frankly, Obamacare insurance, is based on recommendations made by governmental agencies,” Dr. Eric Cubin, a Radiologist said. “So in this case, the United States Preventive Task Force Service is the governmental agency that they're listening to and so they'll base their payment for procedures and studies and screening on what the preventive task force service says."

For patients with a family or personal history of cancer the mammograms may still be covered.
