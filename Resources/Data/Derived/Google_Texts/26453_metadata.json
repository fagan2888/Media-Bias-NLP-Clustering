Foothill Blvd. Rialto\n\nRegistration numbers for Covered California in San Bernardino County soared in a report recently issued by Covered California.\n\nAs of Jan. 31, the county reached 96 percent of its goal for the March 31 deadline, up from the 45 percent level reported at the end of December, which was the lowest in the state for numbers released late last year.\n\nCovered California is the state\u2019s marketplace for the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. In a partnership with the California Department of Health Care Services, the newly created state agency is charged with creating a new health insurance marketplace for businesses and individuals.\n\nOnce significantly behind Fresno and Riverside counties, San Bernardino County has blasted ahead of both.\n\nRiverside County registered 61 percent while Fresno County has hit the 75 percent mark in the most recent state figures, up from 58 percent and 47 percent, respectively, in the Dec. 31 report.\n\nThe increase for San Bernardino County was the result of increasing staff to answer consumer calls, adding phone lines, improving website efficiency, expanding its live Web chat function and upgrading its Spanish-language Web pages, said Edith Lara-Trad, a regional spokeswoman for Covered California.\n\nTotal enrollment is now 34,428, just 1,264 persons shy of the county\u2019s goal of 35,692 people.\n\nSign-ups for this year will cease after March 31, but resume again in the fall for coverage in 2015.\n\n\u201cThey are moving in the right direction, but there is a lot of work yet to do,\u201d said Alex Barrios, spokesman for state Sen. Norma J. Torres, D-Chino.\n\nThe people who were \u201cbanging down the door\u201d wanting health insurance coverage have already signed up, he said.\n\n\u201cThe real work begins now,\u201d he said, as far as reaching those who haven\u2019t signed up.\n\nLast month, Torres introduced S.B. 972, bipartisan legislation to change the composition of Covered California\u2019s board of directors.\n\n\u201cCovered California needs help improving its customer service, fixing technology glitches and enrolling a high number of Latinos and young consumers,\u201d Torres said in a prepared statement. \u201cAccountability starts at the top. After almost three years on the job, it is indisputable that this board of directors needs additional expertise to provide oversight of staff in areas where improvement is needed.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nS.B. 972 would increase the number of board members from five to seven, with the two additional board members being appointed by the governor.\n\nThe bill would add marketing of health insurance products, information technology system management, consumer service delivery research and best practices to the list of areas of expertise.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Registration numbers for Covered California in San Bernardino County soared in a report recently issued by Covered California.As of Jan. 31, the county reached 96 percent of its goal for the March 31 deadline, up from the 45 percent level repor", "title": "Covered California numbers soar in San Bernardino County", "og": {"url": "http://www.sbsun.com/health/20140309/covered-california-numbers-soar-in-san-bernardino-county", "image": {"width": "512px", "identifier": "http://local.sbsun.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/sbsun_new.png", "height": "512px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Covered California numbers soar in San Bernardino County"}, "twitter": {"domain": "sbsun.com", "description": "Registration numbers for Covered California in San Bernardino County soared in a report recently issued by Covered California.As of Jan. 31, the county reached 96 percent of its goal for the March 31 deadline, up from the 45 percent level repor", "title": "Covered California numbers soar in San Bernardino County", "url": "http://www.sbsun.com/health/20140309/covered-california-numbers-soar-in-san-bernardino-county", "image": {"src": "http://local.sbsun.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/sbsun.png?052016"}, "site": "@sbsun", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id563372734", "iphone": "id503662617", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.sanbernardinosun"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "keywords": "Covered California,San Bernardino County, Access to health care", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Covered California,San Bernardino County, Access to health care"}, "article_summary": "RialtoRegistration numbers for Covered California in San Bernardino County soared in a report recently issued by Covered California.\nCovered California Signups Molina Healthcare is hosting Covered California enrollment events San Bernardino County next week.\nOnce significantly behind Fresno and Riverside counties, San Bernardino County has blasted ahead of both.\nCovered California is the state\u2019s marketplace for the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\nThe increase for San Bernardino County was the result of increasing staff to answer consumer calls, adding phone lines, improving website efficiency, expanding its live Web chat function and upgrading its Spanish-language Web pages, said Edith Lara-Trad, a regional spokeswoman for Covered California."}
