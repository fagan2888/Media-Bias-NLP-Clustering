Some conservatives want Trey Gowdy to be Speaker. His office has responded.

Rep. Trey Gowdy has become a sensation on the Right, with his no-nonsense style and committee hearing takedowns of Obama officials garnering him praise and attention.

His high profile helped start chatter about a possible run for the House Speakership — but his office has indicated that the South Carolina Republican has no interest.

“He is not interested in any leadership positions and believes one can have influence without the title,” Gowdy’s spokeswoman, Amanda Duvall, told The Hill newspaper.

Gowdy held visible positions in the committee ranks during the 113th Congress, which stretched from 2013 to this year. He became one of the most quoted watchdogs on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, which has been become prominent during President Obama’s scandal-laden second term. He chaired an immigration subcommittee on the House Judiciary Committee. And Speaker John Boehner named him to lead the special House committee investigating Benghazi.

Boehner reappointed Gowdy to the position for the next Congress.

“I look forward to the definitive report Chairman Gowdy and the Select Committee will present to the American people,” the Speaker said.

That’s quite a haul for a House representative who has only been in Congress since 2011.

Still, conservatives dissatisfied with Boehner’s leadership have consistently searched for an alternative, and Gowdy has been a hot name of late.

As reported by the Washington Examiner, the Tea Party Leadership Fund launched a campaign in September to elevate Gowdy to the Speakership. Supporters and activists on social media helped continue the discussion. One member of Congress, Rep. Walter Jones (R-N.C.), said he would be behind a Gowdy bid.

But if some elements of the Right are looking for a Boehner alternative, they’ll have to search elsewhere.
