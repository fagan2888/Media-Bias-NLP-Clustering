MEDICATIONS COME AT HIGH COST

The price patients pay for drugs is affected by cost categories, or tiers, set by their insurer. Some insurers put all or most drugs for HIV and AIDS, cancer and other chronic conditions in high-cost tiers, according to a recent study that examined midrange “silver” plans sold on state and federal insurance exchanges in eight states. The study also found that more drugs were placed in high-cost tiers for 2015 plans than for 2014 plans.

Note: The eight states in this study represent 60% of U.S. population enrolled in exchanges in 2014.

HIV MEDICATION TIERING ON THE ILLINOIS EXCHANGE

The eight insurers that sell health plans on the federal exchange in Illinois place drugs into cost tiers differently. A higher tier indicates higher costs.

Note: The insurer Assurant was omitted because it does not use a numbered tier system. Assurant classifies five of the listed drugs as nonpreferred brand-name drugs, which are in other plans’ third and fourth tiers. The rest are preferred brand-name drugs and are cheaper.

MONTHLY COST COMPARISONS

These examples compare various costs for four silver plans sold on the exchange, including the price of Atripla, a common single-pill treatment for HIV. Costs for Atripla through the Coventry and Humana plans are based on average wholesale prices and do not account for discounts insurers negotiate with drugmakers.
