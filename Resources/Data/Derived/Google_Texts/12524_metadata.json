One way to do that is through a pass band filter.\n\n\u201cIn part of the electromagnetic spectrum we have visible light, which we can see with our eyes,\u201d Paulson said.\n\nAnother part of the spectrum has lower gigahertz frequencies.\n\n\u201cLike your cell phone, your computer chips, those all work at gigahertz frequencies,\u201d Paulson explained.\n\nPaulson received his post-graduate degree at the University of Utah, where his masters\u2019 thesis was in the field of terahertz filters. His main focus now is finding a way to use the frequencies to improve communication.\n\n\u201cEverybody now has a smart phone, everybody's downloading videos, everybody's consuming a lot of data,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said that in the future, cell phone towers might be devices affixed to buildings or light posts rather than standalone structures, and instead of downloading at 100 megabits per minute, you might be able to download at speeds of up to a gigabit per second.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s sort of an untapped potential that exists,\u201d he said.\n\nThe terahertz research at the University of Utah is headed by Professor Nahata, and it is funded by the Material Research Science Engineering Center.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve done is created filters that work in the terahertz region, where only certain frequencies of the terahertz light will go through the filter, and the other frequencies are either attenuated or reflected back,\u201d he said.\n\nThe filters are printed with different ratios of silver and black carbon inks.\n\n\u201cWhen we print with this silver ink, these structures become conductive,\u201d Paulson said.\n\nAlthough terahertz radiation can be used for other things, such as security and medical technology, Paulson says he's focusing on something else.\n\n\u201cTrying to create communication systems where we can have increased bandwidth that will allow people to have more access to data and a more connected experience,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "SALT LAKE CITY \u2013 University of Utah engineers have discovered a filter for wireless communications that could one day allow cell phone users and internet surfers to download data a thousand times faster.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=324152525", "og": {"site_name": "fox13now.com", "description": "SALT LAKE CITY \u2013 University of Utah engineers have discovered a filter for wireless communications that could one day allow cell phone users and internet surfers to download data a thousand times f\u2026", "title": "U of U engineer working on technology with potential to make download speeds a thousand times faster", "url": "http://fox13now.com/2015/03/08/u-of-u-engineer-working-on-technology-with-potential-to-make-download-speeds-a-thousand-times-faster/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "https://localtvkstu.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/promo250141121.jpg", "height": 360}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://localtvkstu.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/promo250141121.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@fox13now", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@fox13now"}, "keywords": "news, bandwidth, internet speeds, university of utah", "msapplication-tooltip": "News for Salt Lake City, Ogden, Provo and beyond", "p": {"domain_verify": "a9bc8fabb9f6cda780dcd354edb426e8"}, "fb": {"pages": 75831650585}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "application-name": "fox13now.com", "google-site-verification": "avVLxvtHokA_r9gaDC1cvuQNhoxzcJHtFAJItW79fPI", "msvalidate.01": "9CC50DB4C5614EA88B5CFA75E33AAB02", "article": {"publisher": "http://fox13now.com/facebook/", "published_time": "2015-03-09T03:53:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-09T03:53:21+00:00", "author": "http://fox13now.com/facebook/"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://fox13now.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/98a0a4875aa0281a51f538da86df31aa?s=16", "news_keywords": "terahertz radiation, gigahertz, bandwidth research, download speeds,"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9e17\"", "article_summary": "\u201cLike your cell phone, your computer chips, those all work at gigahertz frequencies,\u201d Paulson explained.\nPaulson received his post-graduate degree at the University of Utah, where his masters\u2019 thesis was in the field of terahertz filters.\nAlthough terahertz radiation can be used for other things, such as security and medical technology, Paulson says he's focusing on something else.\n\u201cIn part of the electromagnetic spectrum we have visible light, which we can see with our eyes,\u201d Paulson said.\nTwo years ago, Andrew Paulson started thinking of ways to tap into terahertz radiation, which is a band of frequencies in the electromagnetic spectrum."}
