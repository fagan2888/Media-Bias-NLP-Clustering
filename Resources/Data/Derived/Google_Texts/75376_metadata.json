But what if Ted Cruz wins the nomination? Does Glenn come crawling back?\u201d Carr wonders.\n\nCarr, who is syndicated in 20 markets around New England, recently returned to WRKO in Boston as his flagship station, after four months at nearby WMEX.\n\n\u201cIt is premature for Glenn Beck to leave the Republican Party,\u201d Judson Phillips, founder of Tea Party Nation, tells Breitbart News.\n\n\u201cWe have one final battle in front of us. If the GOP goes full RINO in 2016, nominates Jeb Bush and tries to crush the conservative wing, then it is time for conservatives to vote with their feet. But if we can get a conservative nominee and start replacing leadership, then all is not lost,\u201d Phillips adds.\n\nDan Schultz, a conservative Republican activist in Arizona, is also unimpressed by Beck\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cHe could have spent the last six years actually encouraging his listeners to get involved in the political process by becoming voting members of the Republican Party \u2013 precinct committeemen. But that would have detracted from his business model. He\u2019s part of the \u2018Conservative Grievance Industry.\u2019 All he does is point out problems; he never once offers any \u2018we the people\u2019 real solutions,\u201d Schultz tells Breitbart News.\n\nBeck, the fourth most listened to talk radio host in the country, has had a significant influence on Republican primary battles in 2010, 2012, and 2014, but by his announcement seems to have removed himself as a factor in any 2016 primary contest.\n\nWhy not, critics wonder, stay and fight within the party to ensure that a conservative candidate is nominated? Since the nominee won\u2019t be selected until June of 2016, Beck is, in effect, giving up on a fight that still has one year and three months left before the bell rings.\n\nBy leaving the playing field now, Beck increases the chances that the GOP will nominate an establishment \u201cmoderate\u201d such as Jeb Bush, rather than a more conservative Ted Cruz, Ben Carson, Rand Paul, or Scott Walker.\n\n\u201cIf Glenn and those who share his views don\u2019t like the current state of the Republican Party what have they done to change it?\u201d George Rasley, editor of Richard Viguerie\u2019s ConservativeHQ.com asked on Thursday.\n\n\u201cAssuming Beck is serious in his declaration, what are his alternatives? As a conservative (he self-identifies as a libertarian), what viable options does he have to throw his support and money behind?\u201d Mike Miller at IJ Review asked.\n\nConservativeHQ.com\u2019s Rasley pressed further.\n\n\u201cA political party is made of people \u2013 it is not a set-in-stone institution immune to change \u2013 if you change the people you can change the party,\u201d Rasley wrote.\n\n\u201cWe conservatives are tantalizingly close to achieving the goal Buckley, Goldwater and Reagan set before us \u2013 taking over the Republican Party,\u201d Rasley wrote.\n\n\u201cToday, conservatives are like the Biblical Israelites who could not get to the Promised Land until that generation of failed/flawed leaders had passed from the scene. And, likewise, conservatives are not going to get to the political Promised Land until we get new principled leaders,\u201d Rasley concluded.\n\nRasley\u2019s boss, conservative icon Richard Viguerie, expressed the view of stay and fight conservatives best in his 2014 book, Takeover: The 100-Year War for the Soul of the GOP and How Conservatives Can Finally Win It.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the primaries, stupid!\u201d Viguerie wrote. The phrase has become a battle cry among Tea Party activists gearing up for yet another set of Republican battles in 2016.\n\nBut not all conservatives are criticizing Beck\u2019s move.\n\n\u201cGlenn Beck\u2019s frustration with the Republican Party is what conservatives have been feeling for some time now,\u201d Drew Ryun of the Madison Project tells Breitbart News.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re extremely disappointed in the GOP and their continual capitulation. They campaign on conservative principles yet legislate as liberals. I think we\u2019ll see more conservatives follow Glenn\u2019s lead,\u201d Ryun added.\n\nIn politics, perception of power is often as important as the ability to actually exercise power.\n\nThe challenge conservatives frustrated with the steady increase of centralized power face is determining the most effective strategy to limit that advance.\n\nRick Moran at American Thinker is not sure what, if any, impact Beck\u2019s decision will have. But, like Ryun, he thinks other conservatives may follow his example.\n\n\u201cBeck has a big influence on the Republican base and is a huge booster of the Tea Party,\u201d Moran wrote on Thursday.\n\n\u201cBut in practical terms,\u201d he added, \u201cthe impact on Republican politics of Beck\u2019s decision to leave is muted.\u201d\n\n\u201cCongressional Republicans aren\u2019t done screwing things up yet, so Beck may have some company shortly. It isn\u2019t just immigration and Obamacare that Republicans in Congress are dropping the ball on,\u201d Moran adds. \u201cBudget, taxes, sequestration, defense spending \u2013 the whole gamut of issues near and dear to conservative\u2019s hearts are being fumbled by GOP lawmakers. They have failed to translate their overwhelming victory last November into a conservative agenda. They have failed to put Obama and the Democrats on the defensive despite their advantages.\u201d\n\nGlenn Beck has chosen to leave the current playing field where he is perceived to exercise influence and power. It remains to be seen if his decision to leave the GOP will increase or decrease his ability to influence the political arena.\n\nIn the broader scheme of things, what Glenn Beck does or does not do may not matter much.\n\nWhen it comes to returning the country to its constitutionally limited government roots, what really matters is how millions of average citizens choose to use their time and energy between now and November 2016\u2013and beyond.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Conservatives Take Exception to Glenn Beck's 'Premature Evacuation' from the GOP", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Conservatives Take Exception to Glenn Beck's 'Premature Evacuation' from the GOP", "title": "Conservatives Take Exception to Glenn Beck's 'Premature Evacuation' from the GOP - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/02/glenn-beck-glasses-AP.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2015-03-20T07:30:26-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/03/20/conservatives-take-exception-to-glenn-becks-premature-evacuation-from-the-gop/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Conservatives Take Exception to Glenn Beck's 'Premature Evacuation' from the GOP", "title": "Conservatives Take Exception to Glenn Beck's 'Premature Evacuation' from the GOP - Breitbart", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/02/glenn-beck-glasses-AP.jpg", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Ben Carson, ConservativeHQ.com, Drew Ryun, Glenn Beck, Howie Carr, Jeb Bush, Madison Project, Rand Paul, Republican 2016 Presidential Primaries, Richard Vigurie, Scott Walker, Ted Cruz,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-03-20T07:00:15-07:00", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "modified_time": "2015-03-20T07:30:26-07:00", "tag": "Ted Cruz", "categories": "Big Government,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf638\"", "article_summary": "In the broader scheme of things, what Glenn Beck does or does not do may not matter much.\n\u201cIt is premature for Glenn Beck to leave the Republican Party,\u201d Judson Phillips, founder of Tea Party Nation, tells Breitbart News.\nDan Schultz, a conservative Republican activist in Arizona, is also unimpressed by Beck\u2019s decision.\n\u201cWe conservatives are tantalizingly close to achieving the goal Buckley, Goldwater and Reagan set before us \u2013 taking over the Republican Party,\u201d Rasley wrote.\n\u201cGlenn Beck\u2019s frustration with the Republican Party is what conservatives have been feeling for some time now,\u201d Drew Ryun of the Madison Project tells Breitbart News."}
