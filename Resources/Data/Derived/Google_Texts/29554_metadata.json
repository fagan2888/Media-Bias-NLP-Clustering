Then she moved on.\n\nNot to the next romance, but to something she could plan for: the children she deeply desired and would still have. With or without her ex.\n\n\u201cI was married,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought I was on the way to having a child.\u201d\n\nIt didn\u2019t turn out that way, so the Bethesda, Maryland- based anesthesiologist gathered up the kind of money that would usually buy a new car and submitted to blood tests and hormone injections that she flinchingly gave herself. Last year, at 39, Angelo became a freezer, joining the growing ranks of women putting their eggs on ice as a way of girding for life\u2019s great unknowns. Now, her dreams rest in a row of nitrogen tanks at Shady Grove Fertility, a clinic in a beige office park in Rockville. In the future, perhaps with a partner, she will be able to return for them and proceed with her childbearing plans. Even if she waits a decade, her eggs, doctors say, remain just as they were when she froze them \u2014 whatever Angelo\u2019s age, they will still be a vibrant 39.\n\nAmong urban women in their 30s, freezing is trending. Suddenly, many women \u201cnow have a friend of a friend who has frozen,\u201d says Sarah Elizabeth Richards, a journalist who has had eggs frozen twice and written the book \u201cMotherhood, Rescheduled.\u201d\n\nOnly two years ago, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine lifted the \u201cexperimental\u201d label long attached to egg freezing, giving women a way to extend their reproductive potential past the natural expiration date. Since then, \u201cmore clinics are offering it,\u201d Richards says.\n\nLarge corporations are catching on, too, tossing in egg freezing as a perk to enlist female talent: Last month, Facebook and Apple became the first to announce that they would each offer $20,000 for the reproductive treatments.\n\nIn Silicon Valley and in Manhattan (the town that can\u2019t seem to get over \u201cSex and the City\u201d), empowered ladies have begun picking up informational packets along with cocktails at \u201cegg-freezing parties.\u201d Even Kim Kardashian has reportedly frozen and, naturally, had the whole thing filmed for reality-TV posterity.\n\nIt can cost a woman $12,500 to $18,000 at Shady Grove to put away enough eggs to bolster her chances of having a baby one day. And yet, as the women who freeze know, the investment carries the real possibility of delivering no return at all.\n\nThe women who are freezing defy the stereotype of the start-up worker or body-conscious singleton hoping to squeeze a few extra years out of her career or her 26-inch waistline before a baby. They are not rescheduling pregnancy the way you would an appointment for highlights. The choices they\u2019re making are far more nuanced.\n\nFor women who still hope to meet cute and fall in love before pregnancy, egg freezing has one little-discussed selling point: It gives them time not just for careers but also to meet the right partner, a tricky business as more people postpone marriage or other committed relationships.\n\n\u201cIf you ask women who have frozen their eggs why they did it, I thought the two things \u2014 probably neck-and-neck with each other \u2014 would be that they haven\u2019t found the right partner, and career reasons,\u201d says Joseph Doyle, a reproductive endocrinologist at Shady Grove. \u201cBut almost all of them, when you ask them, it\u2019s that they haven\u2019t found the right partner.\u201d\n\nPERSONAL MOTIVES\n\nOn a sunny Saturday morning in November, dozens of smartly dressed women in fitted blazers and layered scarves file into a Washington design center for Shady Grove Fertility\u2019s first egg-freezing \u201cconference.\u201d\n\nSeveral have come alone. A few arrive with partners. One has brought her mother, others are with friends.\n\nMoney is on everyone\u2019s mind, but among the diverse crowd, which includes D.C. natives, women from the Deep South and others from as far away as Thailand, there are dozens of personal motives.\n\nThe industry largely discourages women in their 20s, who are still likely to meet someone and have children naturally, from freezing. Most women arrive at the Shady Grove offices a full decade later, although, Doyle adds, younger women are increasingly choosing to freeze.\n\nAt 28, Ann Morgan may be one of them. It\u2019s not concern about conceiving a baby, but about having a second and a third, that has brought her and her husband to the conference. Morgan wants to go to graduate school, but that choice means that they will need to plan how to space out their children. Back home in Thailand, she had never heard of egg freezing. If she and her husband choose to freeze, she says with a laugh, she will have to find a way to explain it to her parents.\n\nA 34-year-old woman who asks to be identified only as Jea says that a friend struggling to conceive cornered her and urged her to consider egg freezing.\n\n\u201cKnowing what we\u2019re going through now,\u201d she says her friend told her, \u201cI would have done it when I was your age.\u201d\n\nAnd there\u2019s an outlier: Al Curtis of Alexandria, Virginia, who came with his girlfriend. She is older than he is, he says, glancing at her warmly.\n\n\u201cWhen I was 22 and in college, there was no way I could envision myself sitting here right now. But life hasn\u2019t gone at all how I envisioned it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou adapt as life adapts, and this is one of the things, thankfully, life has adapted to. We\u2019re blessed to have this opportunity. '\n\nNO GUARANTEES\n\nEgg freezing may be a blessing, but it\u2019s by no means a panacea.\n\nThe doctors at Shady Grove like to pull out a chart during consultations. At the top, it shows 10 frozen eggs, about half the number doctors usually recommend extracting from a woman younger than 37. (For older women, the suggested number shoots to as many as 30.) At each stage, from thawing to implantation, viability evaporates. At the bottom of the chart, after the eggs have been fertilized, just two excellent candidates \u2014 now embryos \u2014 remain.\n\nThe odds of implantation for each of those, Doyle will explain to patients, is 50-50.\n\nUntil recently, the most common choice for women and couples unable or unwilling to conceive naturally was IVF, a method of fertilizing and implanting embryos. Egg freezing was largely reserved for young egg donors and women about to embark on aggressive cancer treatments. Like IVF, freezing begins with the harvesting of a woman\u2019s eggs but stops short of fertilization; only when women are ready to conceive are their eggs thawed, fertilized and implanted (to the tune of $6,800).\n\nThe birthrate among women electively freezing their eggs is still fuzzy.\n\n\u201cYou can go ahead and freeze some eggs, and the woman feels great, because, \u2018Oh, I\u2019ve got some eggs in the bank,\u2019 \u201d says Mitchell Rosen, a reproductive endocrinologist and director of the Fertility Preservation Center at the University of California at San Francisco. \u201cBut it\u2019s not about feeling great at that time, it\u2019s about when she comes back and uses them, does it work?\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s really no data on that, doctors say, in part because this generation of freezers has yet to claim its eggs.\n\nIn the meantime, the risks associated with freezing are reportedly few, and data from Italy (where the procedure has been around longer because of the Catholic Church\u2019s opposition to freezing embryos) supports the idea that freezers can go home with babies, Rosen says. The benefit, the possibility of having a baby at 40, 50 or even later could be huge.\n\nSTOPPING THE CLOCK\n\nRosen says that initially, he was uncomfortable doing elective egg freezing.\n\n\u201cI felt guilty, almost, because I didn\u2019t want to give this false sense of hope,\u201d he says.\n\nHis biggest fear is that freezing will encourage women to stop trying on their own, even though the odds remain in favor of the woman who attempts to conceive naturally beginning at 35. The one who returns to thaw her eggs at 45 will have at most only one or two chances at pregnancy.\n\nAs freezing\u2019s popularity grows, it raises some sore points for women, not least the question of the expense that separates those who won\u2019t have to give up on dreams of motherhood from those who will.\n\nThere are understandable fears, too, that employers will offer an egg-freezing benefit as a kind of Trojan horse \u2014 a maneuver that will leave women no option other than to delay childbearing or be left behind at work.\n\nAnd then there are women for whom egg freezing isn\u2019t the answer, says Melanie Notkin, author of the memoir \u201cOtherhood.\u201d Some of the dozens of women Notkin interviewed were aware of the technology, but \u201cdidn\u2019t want to do it,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cTo them it felt like throwing in the towel. If they didn\u2019t do it the way they\u2019d envisioned it \u2014 finding a guy, falling in love, getting married \u2014 they felt like they were giving up on that dream. They don\u2019t want to freeze their eggs, and it\u2019s not because they don\u2019t want to be mothers. It\u2019s not how they want to be mothers.\u201d\n\nAs a doctor, Angelo knows her investment offers no guaranteed return. But she would recommend freezing in a heartbeat to a younger woman on the fence about having children.\n\n\u201cImagine a world where the clock doesn\u2019t tick for women,\u201d Angelo says. \u201cYou could technically have children at any age. It\u2019s such a wonderful gift to women, to take the pressure off them.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2014/12/20141121-AMX-EGG-FREEZING211-e1420561761734.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda025\"", "article_summary": "Egg freezing was largely reserved for young egg donors and women about to embark on aggressive cancer treatments.\nMost women arrive at the Shady Grove offices a full decade later, although, Doyle adds, younger women are increasingly choosing to freeze.\nSTOPPING THE CLOCKRosen says that initially, he was uncomfortable doing elective egg freezing.\nBack home in Thailand, she had never heard of egg freezing.\nNow, her dreams rest in a row of nitrogen tanks at Shady Grove Fertility, a clinic in a beige office park in Rockville."}
