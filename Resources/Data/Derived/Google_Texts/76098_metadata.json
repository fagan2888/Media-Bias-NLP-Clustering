He spent 12 years in the U.S. House of Representatives, sent there by voters from one of South Carolina\u2019s most conservative districts. The American Conservative Union gave him an approval rating of 93. The Christian Coalition gave him a 100.\n\nHe opposed just about everything that President Barack Obama proposed, even though he did refuse to call Obama a socialist. The folks back home loved him anyway.\n\nBut then, in his words, \u201cI committed heresy.\u201d He told people that climate change is real. Words like that have consequences. In 2010, in a primary runoff, the good people of his state\u2019s 4th District voted against this otherwise down-the-line conservative by 71-29 percent.\n\n\u201cIn my first six years (in Congress), I said that climate change was hooey, a figment of Al Gore\u2019s imagination,\u201d Inglis said. \u201cAll I knew was that if he was for it, I was against it. But then I saw the science. Climate change is real. Let\u2019s do something about it.\u201d\n\n\u2756 \u2756 \u2756\n\nInglis was in Tampa on Thursday to speak at the University of South Florida and to make a case for what he calls a conservative, free-enterprise approach to this issue.\n\nHe is the executive director of the Energy and Enterprise Initiative, which favors the elimination of all fuel subsidies and what he calls a \u201crevenue-neutral tax swap\u201d \u2014 tax carbon dioxide emissions, eliminate taxes of income and capital.\n\nIt\u2019s an idea worth discussing, one that rewards lower emissions and encourages responsible growth.\n\n\u201cConservatives see the environmental left as people who want to eat bugs, walk and destroy the economy,\u201d he said. \u201cBut really, they just haven\u2019t seen a solution they like yet. What they see are big-government initiatives that cost them a lot of money, so they say, \u2018What problem?\n\n\u201cMaybe they should listen to the insurance companies that are studying this very closely and setting their actuary tables by the data.\u201d\n\n\u2756 \u2756 \u2756\n\nAcknowledging the problem is, well, a problem \u2014 especially in Tallahassee, where it apparently is policy that officials cannot say the words \u201cclimate\u201d and \u201cchange\u201d in the same sentence. Judging by that and the message South Carolina voters sent to Inglis, denial has become institutionalized.\n\nI don\u2019t think you can dismiss the impact of relentless mockery by conservative talk radio hosts and bloggers on this issue. People hear words like \u201cjunk science\u201d and assume anyone saying the opposite must be liberal scum out to confiscate their SUV.\n\nAnger drives radio ratings and keeps talk show hosts on the air, and a conservative host won\u2019t get far by telling listeners, \u201cNo, we ought to believe scientists on this one.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they realize they\u2019re being played,\u201d Inglis said. \u201cI don\u2019t think they realize these are entertainers. They think these are Rush\u2019s (Limbaugh) sincere beliefs.\u201d\n\nHe told of calling into a local radio station manager in South Carolina after hearing the host complain that he was basically approaching an endorsement for Obamacare. This, after Inglis posted 17 reasons to oppose that measure.\n\n\u201cThe manager told me, \u2018The best way to destroy a talk show is to make the host a fact-checker,\u2019 \u201d Inglis said.\n\nDear reader: Back away from the keyboard for just a second. No need to remind me how MSNBC hosts are just as one-sided. Of course they are. Their message may be from the extreme opposite, but the tactics of fear and division are the same.\n\nThat\u2019s how we get political purity tests for candidates from both major parties. Anyone who doesn\u2019t check all the boxes gets kicked off the boat. And that\u2019s how you get leaders in Tallahassee who won\u2019t even say the magic words because they might be accused of political heresy like Bob Inglis was.", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Fri, 27 Mar 2015 01:01:00 -0400", "Description": "Bob Inglis is a Republican who preaches the gospel of gun rights, lower taxes and less government.
