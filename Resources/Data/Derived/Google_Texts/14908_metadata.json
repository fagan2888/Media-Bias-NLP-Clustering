He laid out his findings in a paper published in 2005 in the Neurosurgery journal.\n\nThe forensic pathologist said repeated hits to the head in high-impact contact sports like football have long-term health risks, especially for children.\n\n\"There are other options you can choose from,\u201d Omalu said. \u201c(Like) swimming. A retired NFL player said to me one day, 'Take the ball from your son and give him a racket.'\"\n\nThe research made some waves within the National Football League.\n\nOmalu told the audience that after his paper was published, the NFL accused him of being a criminal and a fraudulent doctor. But the league has since revised its rules toward concussions.\n\nJerry Bell, who played tight end for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the 1980s, was in the audience. He said in spite of the danger, it's hard to change the culture surrounding football.\n\n\"You can change the concussion protocol, you can sit people out a week, you can say you can't go back into the football game, but you can't stop the head trauma and that's the key and that's the one thing that this game can't change,\" Bell said. \"I don't think they can change that.\"\n\nThe movie \"Concussion\" opens in theaters on Christmas Day.", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "A doctor who will be portrayed by actor Will Smith in the upcoming movie, \"Concussion,\" told a Tampa audience how his research into brain injuries has", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/concussion-doctor-speaks-tampa-ahead-movie-premiere", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/healthnewsfl/files/styles/medium/public/201512/omalu_concussion2.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A doctor who will be portrayed by actor Will Smith in the upcoming movie, \"Concussion,\" told a Tampa audience how his research into brain injuries has", "title": "\"Concussion\" Doctor Speaks in Tampa Ahead of Movie Premiere"}, "story_id": 458458735, "twitter": {"site": "@HealthNewsFL", "card": "summary", "creator": "@DaylinaMiller"}, "author": "Daylina Miller", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "&quot;Concussion&quot; Doctor Speaks in Tampa Ahead of Movie Premiere"}, "nid": 12877, "datePublished": "2015-12-04", "keywords": "concussion, concussions, CTE, Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy, Bennet Omalu, National Football League, NFL, USF", "wordCount": 388, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "A doctor who will be portrayed by actor Will Smith in the upcoming movie, \"Concussion,\" told a Tampa audience how his research into brain injuries has dramatically changed how professional football approaches players.\nOmalu told the audience that after his paper was published, the NFL accused him of being a criminal and a fraudulent doctor.\nJerry Bell, who played tight end for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the 1980s, was in the audience.\nOmalu discovered CTE in 2002 when he performed an autopsy on the brain of Hall of Fame center Mike Webster.\nThe movie \"Concussion\" opens in theaters on Christmas Day."}
