A leading healthcare improvement company, Premier conducts the biannual survey to highlight major trends affecting healthcare providers and the industry at-large.\n\nNearly half of survey respondents \u2013 primarily health system CEOs, chief financial officers and chief operating officers \u2013 believe the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and population health management are having the biggest impact on their organization\u2019s ability to deliver care.\n\nExpanding and integrating high-value post-acute care networks is an important step in the population health transition, cited by 95 percent of executives as a key area of focus over the next three years. But 94 percent of respondents believe creating these networks is the greatest challenge their systems will face over the same timeframe.\n\n\u201cThe ACA unleashed a number of alternative payment policies that incent providers to move toward accountability for the health of a defined population,\u201d said Michael J. Alkire, chief operating officer at Premier. \u201cAs healthcare continues to transition from an acute-care hospital focus toward an integrated system of providers, the creation of high-value post-acute care networks is essential for success within alternative payment models, such as bundled payment programs and accountable care organizations (ACOs).\u201d\n\nRetail care\n\nShifting payment policies also have providers exploring where, how and with whom to partner and interact to enhance population health. For example, many health systems are recognizing the value of a retail approach, with 66 percent projecting their organization will own or operate its own retail pharmacy in the next three years, up from 54 percent in fall 2015.\n\n\u201cA key aspect of population health is meeting the patient where they are and providing affordable care options at each level of need,\u201d Alkire said. \u201cIncreasingly, we\u2019re seeing providers looking to build their own capabilities to reduce variability and create the standard for how care is provided across the entire episode.\u201d\n\nHealth IT\n\nHealth information technology (IT) has consistently been the area where respondents projected significant capital investments over the last five years. When asked to rank areas of high capital spend, 84% of respondents chose health IT.\n\nHaving interoperable data across the entire continuum of care \u2013 including employed and affiliated physician networks \u2013 is critical for providers to seamlessly manage population health. While 68 percent of executives say their organizations are successfully accessing ambulatory data from employed physician networks, just 38 percent feel they\u2019re successfully accessing data from affiliated or non-employed physician networks.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one thing for providers in the same organization using the same systems to successfully share data; integrating data across disparate systems is something else altogether,\u201d said Alkire. \u201cMany affiliated practices lack the proper incentives to invest in high-cost data sharing agreements and interoperable interfaces. We urgently need public policies that require health IT interoperability standards so that providers can access data from any system.\u201d\n\nThe supply chain and population health\n\nThough often overlooked in population health discussions, the supply chain presents significant opportunities for providers to improve care efficiency and effectiveness as they create alternative payment models.\n\nHealth IT can play a critical role in unifying systems for a holistic view of purchasing across the entire continuum. But many health systems are operating disparate software systems for procurement, accounting, contract management and finance across their facilities. This creates system-wide blind spots that can seriously hamper product standardization and other efforts to improve efficiency. Such issues are magnified by the growth of affiliated physician practices, which have led to complexities for supply chain management, according to 54 percent of respondents.\n\nThere\u2019s no place where enhancing standardization is more important than with physician preference items (PPI), which account for 60 percent of all medical and surgical supply spend. Getting all physicians to standardize around a single lowest cost device is a challenge. Yet, it\u2019s one that executives are addressing head-on, with 96 percent expecting to further standardize PPI purchases over the next three years.\n\n\u201cBy marrying all the functions associated with purchasing across the continuum on a single IT platform, materials managers can close gaps and generate the significant savings needed to succeed in the new world of payment reform and cost cuts,\u201d said Alkire.\n\nAbout the Economic Outlook survey\n\nPremier\u2019s Economic Outlook survey highlights emerging economic and industry trends impacting health systems.
