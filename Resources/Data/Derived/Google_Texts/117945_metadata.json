(Photo: 2010 CNBC photo)\n\nFor nearly 50 years, the Remington Model 700 rifle has been the preferred choice for millions of hunters, shooting sports enthusiasts and military and law enforcement personnel.\n\nOUR VIEW: Amid court secrecy, guns continued to kill and wound\n\nDespite emotional reporting of baseless and unproven allegations and plaintiff lawyer assertions, several undisputed facts remain:\n\nThe Model 700 is the most popular, reliable, accurate and trusted bolt-action rifle in the world, with over 5 million rifles produced and billions of rounds fired over nearly five decades.\n\nThe Model 700 is the firearm of choice for elite shooters from America's military and law enforcement communities, and has been the platform for the United States Marine Corps and the U.S. Army precision sniper weapon systems for over two decades, both of which specifically require the \"Walker\" trigger mechanism.\n\nThe Model 700, including its trigger mechanism, has been free of any defect since it was first produced and, despite any careless reporting to the contrary, the gun's use by millions of Americans has proven it to be a safe, trusted and reliable rifle.\n\nBoth Remington and experts hired by plaintiff attorneys have conducted testing on guns returned from the field which were alleged to have fired without a trigger pull, and neither has ever been able to duplicate such an event on guns which had been properly maintained and which had not been altered after sale.\n\nRemington takes safety very seriously. We support hunter safety and other educational programs nationwide, and include with every Remington firearm the \"Ten Commandments of Firearm Safety,\" which urgently remind every gun owner that if proper firearms safety rules are followed, no accidental injuries would ever occur.\n\nThe men and women who build, own and shoot the Remington Model 700 take great pride in a product that, over the last half century, has set the bar for safety, reliability and performance.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1AY50Ie", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Remington Arms, which declined to provide an opposing view, issued this statement on Sept. 7, 2010:", "og": {"site_name": "USA TODAY", "description": "Remington Arms, which declined to provide an opposing view, issued this statement on Sept. 7, 2010:", "title": "Remington Arms: A safe, trusted, reliable rifle", "url": "http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2014/12/28/remington-arms-model-700-cnbc-editorials-debates/20980165/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Remington Arms, which declined to provide an opposing view, issued this statement on Sept. 7, 2010:", "title": "Remington Arms: A safe, trusted, reliable rifle", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f936ea70a6e1972c41bbc9159ef752bdc6c46465/c=323-0-879-556&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2014/12/28/USATODAY/USATODAY/635553928727086855-OPPOSE.JPG", "creator": "@usatoday", "site": "@usatoday", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "fb": {"app_id": 215046668549694}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Topics/Editorials and Debates", "gci-categories": "Topics/Editorials and Debates", "gci-asset-type": "story", "title": "Remington Arms: A safe, trusted, reliable rifle", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4cf73147e87d243f3eb176cc0617943cc6207a9e/c=303-0-722-558/local/-/media/2014/12/28/USATODAY/USATODAY/635553928727086855-OPPOSE.JPG", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/afd6791f85cef2a7bd35b920d045b8e457a7a4b3/c=323-0-879-556/local/-/media/2014/12/28/USATODAY/USATODAY/635553928727086855-OPPOSE.JPG", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/966e4d7548c30ea45a487590c06984361a186108/c=285-0-1024-556/local/-/media/2014/12/28/USATODAY/USATODAY/635553928727086855-OPPOSE.JPG", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ede4709d3fd9ae3ffa005d7807700e0a394c5c31/c=0-0-984-556&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2014/12/28/USATODAY/USATODAY/635553928727086855-OPPOSE.JPG", "publishtime": "2014-12-28T19:51:30.107000-05:00", "shorthed": "Remington: Safe, trusted, reliable rifle", "articleid": 20980165, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/33817be64005b21405170b0527bb715bf102f6f6/c=0-0-984-556/local/-/media/2014/12/28/USATODAY/USATODAY/635553928727086855-OPPOSE.JPG", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/79a8f03301144166ef433389d16e6f3c6e15e836/c=328-0-639-556/local/-/media/2014/12/28/USATODAY/USATODAY/635553928727086855-OPPOSE.JPG"}}, "news_keywords": "Remington Arms, Model 700, CNBC, editorials, debates,"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3605\"", "article_summary": "Remington Arms, which declined to provide an opposing view, issued this statement on Sept. 7, 2010:A Remington Model 700 rifle in 2010.\n(Photo: 2010 CNBC photo)For nearly 50 years, the Remington Model 700 rifle has been the preferred choice for millions of hunters, shooting sports enthusiasts and military and law enforcement personnel.\nThe Model 700, including its trigger mechanism, has been free of any defect since it was first produced and, despite any careless reporting to the contrary, the gun's use by millions of Americans has proven it to be a safe, trusted and reliable rifle.\nWe support hunter safety and other educational programs nationwide, and include with every Remington firearm the \"Ten Commandments of Firearm Safety,\" which urgently remind every gun owner that if proper firearms safety rules are followed, no accidental injuries would ever occur.\nThe men and women who build, own and shoot the Remington Model 700 take great pride in a product that, over the last half century, has set the bar for safety, reliability and performance."}
