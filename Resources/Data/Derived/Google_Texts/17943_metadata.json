He has taken center stage as a cast member with the traveling production of the musical \u201cThe Phantom of the Opera,\u201d which opened Wednesday at Tampa\u2019s Straz Center.\n\n\u201cI came like any other immigrant,\u201d Viveros said. \u201cMy dad had come to America a year before my mom and myself. My dad saved money for us to travel to the United States.\u201d\n\nTheir immigration status remained the same \u2014 illegal immigrants \u2014 until Viveros was in high school. Reflecting back on the time of that status change, he still can feel the relief.\n\n\u201cI had kept it a secret for many years,\u201d he said. \u201cMy parents were afraid that if I told anyone they would tell immigration about us. So, finally, that fear was gone.\u201d\n\nViveros and his mother became naturalized American citizens the same day. But they didn\u2019t turn their backs on their Colombian past, he said. His parents insisted they speak Spanish and remember their heritage while embracing the world around them.\n\nPersistence and ambition are values Viveros inherited from his parents, he said, adding that music always was a part of his life.\n\n\u201cI do not remember Christmastime without carols and singing them to everyone,\u201d he said. \u201cI do not know a dinner or a family party without dancing with my aunts.\u201d\n\nHe also has vivid memories of his mother salsa dancing while doing chores.\n\n\u201cAnd when I was doing my homework, I always listened to music,\u201d he said. \u201cEven when we watched television, we\u2019d put on music. Unknowingly, all this instilled a love of music in me, so I decided that\u2019s what I wanted to do professionally.\u201d\n\nThe first step, however, was an audition at the LaGuardia High School in New York, which specializes in the performing arts. The same school was featured in the Broadway hit \u201cFame.\u201d There, his voice and his command of several languages came together.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s different to have a love of music and slowly start training the voice,\u201d he said, \u201cwhile also learning to sing in three languages. Initially, I wanted to be an opera singer, then I decided to do musical theater,\u201d Viveros said.\n\nHis studies continued at the State University of New York. There, while performing in musicals, he spotted the supporting role of Ubaldo Piangi he now plays in \u201cPhantom.\u201d\n\n\u201cUbaldo is a character so unbelievable, the principal tenor,\u201d he said. \u201cI had moved to Los Angeles because I wanted to start a career on TV, but when I was offered this role I couldn\u2019t say no.\u201d\n\nViveros said his high point on stage came a year ago.\n\n\u201cI was in Philadelphia, when my grandparents, my aunts, my brothers, my whole family got to see \u2018The Phantom of the Opera,\u2019 he said. \u201cThey had all seen Frank, the singer who travels, before, but they had never seen anything like this production. That day, I saw my mom and my dad smiling. It was an achievement for them because I would not be here without them.\u201d\n\nViveros, who communicates with fans via Twitter at @Frrankly, said this production of \u201cPhantom\u201d has been modernized somewhat. It includes the latest in high-tech stage presentation.\n\n\u201cThe story has not changed and the music is the same, but the way the story is being told has changed,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is new technology that did not exist in 1988. It is a new ghost.\u201d\n\nmwarren@centrotampa.com\n\n(813) 259-8037", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sat, 20 Dec 2014 23:06:50 -0400", "Description": "TAMPA \u2014 At age 4, Frank Viveros left Colombia to join his father in New York City for a better life \u2014 but one shrouded in secrecy because the family lived as illegal immigrants.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "TAMPA \u2014 At age 4, Frank Viveros left Colombia to join his father in New York City for a better life \u2014 but one shrouded in secrecy because the family lived as illegal immigrants.", "title": "Colombian immigrant sings his way into \u2018Phantom\u2019", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/news/politics/colombian-immigrant-sings-his-way-into-phantom-20141220/", "image": {"width": 1794, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20141220/ARTICLE/141229935/EP/1/1/EP-141229935.jpg", "height": 2466}, "updated_time": "2014-12-20T23:06:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "TAMPA \u2014 At age 4, Frank Viveros left Colombia to join his father in New York City for a better life \u2014 but one shrouded in secrecy because the family lived as illegal immigrants.", "title": "Colombian immigrant sings his way into \u2018Phantom\u2019", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20141220/ARTICLE/141229935/AR/0/AR-141229935.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2014-12-20T23:06:50Z-04", "modified_time": "2014-12-20T23:06:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca592\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe story has not changed and the music is the same, but the way the story is being told has changed,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI was in Philadelphia, when my grandparents, my aunts, my brothers, my whole family got to see \u2018The Phantom of the Opera,\u2019 he said.\nHe has taken center stage as a cast member with the traveling production of the musical \u201cThe Phantom of the Opera,\u201d which opened Wednesday at Tampa\u2019s Straz Center.\nPersistence and ambition are values Viveros inherited from his parents, he said, adding that music always was a part of his life.\nInitially, I wanted to be an opera singer, then I decided to do musical theater,\u201d Viveros said."}
