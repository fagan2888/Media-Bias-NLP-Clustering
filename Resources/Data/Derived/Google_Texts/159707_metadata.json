That the justices are \u201cnot-so-reclusive\u201d has been news itself. There\u2019s even a website dedicated to tracking the justices\u2019 many speaking engagements across the country and world.\n\nThe problem isn\u2019t that the justices speak too little, it\u2019s what happens when they voice any kind of personal opinion. When Roberts used a baseball analogy at his confirmation hearing, he was attacked in dozens of law review articles about it. When Scalia gave a candid interview to New York magazine, he was mocked for his religious beliefs. As for his not being willing to review amicus briefs, friend-of-the-court submissions at the Court are at record highs, and all of the justices, including Scalia, regularly cite the briefs in their opinions. With respect to Kennedy, I always thought that world travel and meeting people from other cultures broadened one\u2019s horizons?\n\nLithwick similarly paints the Court\u2019s building as fostering isolation, including the lack of cameras during oral arguments and that the \u201cjustices closed off the giant bronze doors at the front of the building, above which the words Equal Justice Under Law are engraved.\u201d Everyone who saw what HBO's John Oliver did with the Court\u2019s audio recordings of the arguments\u2014portraying the justices as nine talking dogs\u2014can imagine why the justices might be reluctant to introduce video. And, really, do we want the next generation of Supreme Court advocates playing to the cameras? I can see it now: \u201cIf Obamacare isn\u2019t a tax, the statute you must axe.\u201d\n\nAs for the front entrance, I did enjoy walking up the marble steps like Rocky and pushing through the doors. But security trumps my cinematic fantasy\u2014and at least they didn't permanently close a street like the White House did. Try walking up to the iron gates at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue without an appointment and ask to stroll around the West Wing. The Supreme Court lets visitors do that every day. Changing an entrance to an exit and having a few metal detectors seems a small price to protect the entire third branch of government.\n\nLithwick ends with what seems to be the real beef with \u201cthis group of Ivy-trained Washington insiders\u201d: recent controversial decisions by the Roberts Court. I don\u2019t agree with all of the high court\u2019s decisions either, but most of the Court\u2019s decisions aren\u2019t the ones covered in the newspapers or hyped at the end of the term. They involve workaday circuit splits on highly technical, prosaic legal questions that require experience and brainpower to resolve. I\u2019ve worked on several such cases. The justices protected veterans against an inept VA, overturned a death sentence issued by a broken Alabama capital system, and issued decisions protecting workers alleging discrimination. These didn\u2019t get splashy media coverage or inspire protests and counter-protests outside One First Street\u2014but they did require nine \u201cdazzling minds\u201d and \u201cjudicial thoroughbreds\u201d to resolve.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "I\u2019m a longtime fan of Slate's Dahlia Lithwick and her coverage of the Supreme Court.
