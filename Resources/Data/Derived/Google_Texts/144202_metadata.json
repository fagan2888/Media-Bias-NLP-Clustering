Minuteman Health, the Massachusetts CO-OP (which stands for consumer operated and oriented plan) is a non-profit insurer that was supposed to provide lower-cost insurance in local markets, but according to the latest estimates, Minuteman is facing serious financial issues.\n\nCO-OPs like Minuteman rely on having enough members to offset their costs, which as start-up health care organizations, can be quite substantial. Minuteman estimated that they need roughly 40,000 members \u201cjust to break even,\u201d and expected to sign-up 30,000 in their first year. Instead, they signed up less than 2,000 their first year. Last year they reached 14,000 (only 35 percent of their breakeven enrollment) and they hope to have 23,000 by the end of 2016, which is likely overly optimistic given the markets they are operating in.\n\nMinuteman was one of the 23 insurers launched two years ago as part of Obamacare, with $2.4 billion in seed money from taxpayers. Minuteman got $156 million to get off the ground, a now they\u2019re facing the same struggles that have led to more than half of the CO-OPs shutting down.\n\nIn yet another moment of candor, Massachusetts\u2019 most notorious health advisor, Jonathan Gruber, said that \u201cthe CO-OP program was a risky venture from the outset, given how difficult it is for new companies to develop provider networks and compete with established insurance companies. But he said it was a risk worth taking,\u201d because \u201cit could pay off by giving consumers access to affordable insurance.\u201d\n\nAccess to affordable insurance was the selling point for all of Obamacare, a plan that Gruber had a key role in creating, and passed because of, as he put it, \u201cthe stupidity of the American voter,\u201d but it wasn\u2019t voters who passed it and supported it.\n\nAs a board member of Massachusetts\u2019 Health Connector, the state\u2019s state-based exchange, Gruber oversaw a disastrous rollout and collapse of one of Obamacare\u2019s most ballyhooed state marketplaces. What was supposed to be an easy way for people to sign up for affordable health insurance turned out to be a system that couldn\u2019t perform as promised.\n\nNow the Massachusetts CO-OP also looks doomed to fail. Between the collapse of the Connector, the resulting depressed enrollment, and millions of dollars in risk adjustment payments to companies like Blue Cross Blue Shield, Minuteman is struggling to stay afloat.\n\nIn order to keep prices down, Minuteman\u2019s \u201cnetwork of doctors and hospitals excludes the state\u2019s biggest providers, including Partners HealthCare and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.\u201d This may be one of the reasons for lower than expected enrollment.\n\nThe company\u2019s former chief financial officer told the Boston Globe,\n\n\u201cIn Massachusetts, the narrow network is an unpopular product,\u201d Fallon said, \u201cand the people who do pick it, it\u2019s because they don\u2019t anticipate any health care needs.\u201d\n\nIn a previous interview, health care expert, Josh Archambault also told the Boston Globe, Minuteman has \u201ca huge challenge to be long-term sustainable, and given the track record of the other co-ops around the country, there doesn\u2019t appear to be others that have cracked the nut quite yet.\u201d\n\nMany of us warned that these co-ops couldn\u2019t survive, regardless of how well intentioned they might have been. Progressives may try to manipulate the markets, and prop them up with billions in taxpayer dollars, but eventually they collapse.\n\nIf this trend of co-op failures continues it\u2019ll only be a matter of time before I\u2019m right back here reporting another failed Obamacare co-op \u2013 only the names and number of affected insured will change.\n\n________________________________________\n\nKristina Ribali is the Senior Coalitions Director for the Foundation for Government Accountability.
