It marks one of the first instances of a security company acknowledging the U.S. government may have been involved in propping open a backdoor into a product.\n\nThe type of encryption \u2013 a particular random number generator endorsed by the U.S. government \u2013 previously has been shown to be vulnerable to hacks. But documents recently leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden suggested the U.S. intelligence agency had played a role in creating a backdoor in the standard.\n\nRSA had set that standard as a default setting in some of its security products, including all versions of its \u201cData Protection Manager,\u201d which encrypts sensitive data.\n\n\u201cTo ensure a high level of assurance in their application, RSA strongly recommends that customers discontinue use,\u201d of the encryption standard, RSA said in an email sent to customers seen by the Wall Street Journal. It is providing guidance to customers on how to change the default settings.\n\nIn the email to developers, RSA never mentions NSA, but references a \u201cdebate\u201d around the encryption in question.\n\nThe change in policy does not affect RSA\u2019s flagship SecurID tokens, used by millions of workers for secure access to their corporate networks.\n\nThe National Institute of Standards and Technology endorsed the affected encryption standard in 2006. But this month, it said it would reopen a debate over whether to still back it, following the most recent Snowden leaks.\n\nNews of RSA\u2019s move was reported earlier by ArsTechnica and Wired.\n\nRSA\u2019s full email, provided by a company official, is below.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "RSA Security privately told customers Thursday to ditch an encryption algorithm that reportedly contains a flaw engineered by the National Security Agency.", "title": "RSA: Don\u2019t Use Encryption Influenced by NSA", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2013/09/19/rsa-dont-use-encryption-influenced-by-nsa/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/MK-CB182_RSABT_D_20130226171110.jpg"}, "site": "WSJD", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Tech", "article.headline": "RSA: Don\u2019t Use Encryption Influenced by NSA", "description": "RSA Security privately told customers Thursday to ditch an encryption algorithm that reportedly contains a flaw engineered by the National Security Agency.", "article_section": "Tech", "author": "Danny Yadron", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Digits Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Digits", "article.summary": "RSA Security privately told customers Thursday to ditch an encryption algorithm that reportedly contains a flaw engineered by the National Security Agency.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2013-09-20T01:18:03-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-158", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2013/09/19/rsa-dont-use-encryption-influenced-by-nsa/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-DGB-29478", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Tech", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "RSA Security privately told customers Thursday to ditch an encryption algorithm that reportedly contains a flaw engineered by the National Security Agency.", "title": "RSA: Don\u2019t Use Encryption Influenced by NSA", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2013/09/19/rsa-dont-use-encryption-influenced-by-nsa/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Digits", "article.id": "BL-DGB-29478", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2013-09-20T01:18:46-04:00"}, "article_summary": "In the email to developers, RSA never mentions NSA, but references a \u201cdebate\u201d around the encryption in question.\n\u201cTo ensure a high level of assurance in their application, RSA strongly recommends that customers discontinue use,\u201d of the encryption standard, RSA said in an email sent to customers seen by the Wall Street Journal.\nThe National Institute of Standards and Technology endorsed the affected encryption standard in 2006.\nRSA Executive Chairman Art Coviello Bloomberg NewsRSA Security, a division of EMC, privately told customers Thursday to ditch an encryption algorithm that reportedly contains a flaw engineered by the National Security Agency.\nThe type of encryption \u2013 a particular random number generator endorsed by the U.S. government \u2013 previously has been shown to be vulnerable to hacks."}
