But according to a study published in the National Institutes of Health\u2019s journal Environmental Health Perspectives, these alternatives may be just as bad.\n\nTo investigate, lead author, Chun Z. Yang, and colleagues analyzed 455 BPA-free plastic containers such as storage products and food containers. \u201cAlmost all commercially available plastic products we sampled \u2014 independent of resin, product, or retail source \u2014leached chemicals having reliably detectable EA, including those advertised as BPA-free,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cIn some cases, BPA-free products released chemicals having more EA than did BPA-containing products.\u201d\n\nThe findings raise the possibility that EA-related health outcomes may not necessarily be limited to BPA. According to Dr. Laura Vandenberg, a professor of environmental health sciences at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, any chemical that influences the endocrine system may bring with it a number of consequences.\n\n\"We know that there's a cost when we mess with the levels of these hormones in our bodies, regardless of how we do it,\" she said, speaking to Mother Jones. \"Even small changes early in life can alter brain and organ development and set us up for disease later on.\"\n\nBPA, Plastics, and Your Health\n\nPeer-reviewed research both rejects and supports the link between BPA. For example, a study with mice published earlier this year in the journal Endocrinology found that hormonal changes in utero may triple a child\u2019s risk of developing prostate cancer.\n\n\"The amount of BPA we fed the mice was equivalent to levels ingested by the average person,\" Dr. Gail Prins, lead author and professor of physiology at the University of Illinois at Chicago, explained. \"We didn't feed them exorbitantly high doses.\"\n\nConversely, the FDA typically rejects these studies, citing flawed methodology. As of 2014, the agency still considers BPA a safe chemical.\n\nBy suggesting that all commercial plastic may carry similar risks, Yang\u2019s study offers an uncomfortable solution to the debate.\n\nSource: Yang CZ, Yaniger SI, Jorda C, Klein DJ, Bittner GD.
