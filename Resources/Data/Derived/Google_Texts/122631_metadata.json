It has taken me six years to convince Dad that Conservatism is much better for everyone than Liberalism. Dad is old school with basic beliefs. Democrats are for the working class little guy. Republicans are for the rich. Oh, and Republicans are also racists.So, you can imagine the challenges I faced trying to re-educated him. Dad believed the Tea Party was racist because he heard it on CNN. I said,Dad chuckled.I know what you are thinking. Lloyd, why haven't you turned your dad on to Fox News? I have tried. I do not know why he rejects Fox and conservative talk radio. Still, I am working on it folks. I am working on it.With the biased MSM as his main news source, Dad is a low-info voter. I have been working on Dad, educating him one issue at a time. Dad is a good guy, warm and compassionate. I am trying to get him to use his common sense and instincts for right and wrong rather than getting caught up in the Democrats' and MSM emotional manipulative spin on issues.We chatted about illegal immigration. Dad has been a Christian pastor for over 50 years. He is still the pastor of four churches; driving several miles to visit the sick and shut-ins.Dad chuckled. I do not recall Dad ever turning away anyone in need.Mom was frustrated with people who did not want to contribute in anyway to Dad's ministry; never attending a single service or listening to a sermon. All they were interested in was the freebies available at the church; food, clothing and so on. They wanted Rev. \"My-cus-sin\" (Marcus), never did get his name right, to perform their weddings and funerals for free. They expected Dad to show up at their homes or hospitals in the middle of the night in times of crisis, despite never setting one foot in Dad's church. Still, Dad faithfully did it all. He was functioning on a higher level; God's Love.I told Dad that the illegals flooding across our borders have the same we're-just-here-to-take mindset that frustrated mom. They do not want to assimilate. Heck, they could not give a rat's derriere about what it means to be an American. Illegals proudly fly their Mexican flag and are offended when our kids wear American flag t-shirts to school on Cinco de Mayo. http://bit.ly/1unBI1I Illegals receive entitlements that are unavailable to U.S. Citizens. They have no desire, nor is there a pressing need for them to learn English.While liberals claim that poor humble illegals are quaking in their boots \"hiding in the shadows,\" illegals are boldly and arrogantly protesting in our streets, demanding entitlements and that they not be deported. http://wapo.st/11l2Ofx Illegals claim a moral right to be in our country, while blatantly breaking and ignoring our laws.The spin promoted from the bully pulpits of the MSM and White House is anyone who does not turn a blind eye to illegals breaking our laws, making demands and abusing our system is a hardhearted racist.Meanwhile, a mysterious polio-like illness has paralyzed 75 kids across America. http://usat.ly/1qN18Cj A rare Enterovirus D68 is causing an outbreak across 45 states sickening nearly 700, mostly children. http://bit.ly/1vfytwN Illegal alien minors are also spreading dengue fever, swine flu, tuberculosis and possibly Ebola. http://bit.ly/1kCUyuR Obama's open border policy has delivered over 300,000 illegals, 75,000 of them are children who directly entered schools across America without proper examinations and so on. http://bit.ly/VNWUlk It has been exposed that many of the illegals are gang members and drug dealers. http://bit.ly/1q8ZOyN As inconceivable as this is to imagine, it does appear that one man, exploiting the historical aspect of his presidency to break the law at will, may be allowed to fundamentally transform America. Obama via executive order unilaterally imposed amnesty for 5 million illegals, plus the 75,000 children who invaded our country and their parents. http://bit.ly/1uE8WGSIf Republicans do not stop Obama's insanity, one characterless out-of-control arrogant evil liar will fundamentally transform America. That is totally unacceptable.Years ago, I wrote a satirical article to illustrate illegal immigration and how we are expected to deal with it. I was shocked that many people thought my fictional scenario was true. Their reaction spoke to how crazy, brain dead and emotion driven the topic of illegal immigration has become and what people think of our government.In my fictional parable, I came home to discover that a family had taken up residency in my backyard storage shed. Displaying remarkable arrogance and a sense of entitlement the squatters refused to leave arguing that they were simply seeking a better life. Their TV, computers and etc were powered with an electrical cord plugged into the exterior outlet of my home.Infuriated, I asked the police and City Hall to remove the trespassers from my property. Upon local government discovering the race of my invaders, I was accused of being selfish, cruel and using the law to hide my hateful racism. Suddenly, I began witnessing a migration of my trespassers' relatives and friends into my backyard; littering my property with tents, makeshift shelters and old vehicles.The city cited me for numerous code violations which included all the dangerous electric cords and bizarre hook-ups into my electrical power source. I was ordered to immediately upgrade my electrical power to meet the needs of my current and potential new residents. http://bit.ly/1Hc2SPN From that point in my imaginary tale, the pandering to my trespassers by my local government got even more outrageous. You get the idea. Folks, this is exactly what is happening in our national home, America. Illegals are showing up and making outrageous demands. The Obama Administration is siding with them. The reality of the situation is just that simple.Imagine, \"Jeopardy\" game show host Alex Trebek saying,If we do not politically stop him, the correct Final Jeopardy question will be, \"Who is Barack Hussein Obama?\"\u00a9 Lloyd Marcus", "article_metadata": {"description": "After six years of putting up with his eldest son actively working with those crazy racist white folks in the Tea Party against the first black president, my 86 year old black dad has finally begun to understand why"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddeef\"", "article_summary": "Executive amnesty: will we allow one man to fundamentally transform America?\nhttp://bit.ly/1uE8WGSIf Republicans do not stop Obama's insanity, one characterless out-of-control arrogant evil liar will fundamentally transform America.\nhttp://bit.ly/1q8ZOyN As inconceivable as this is to imagine, it does appear that one man, exploiting the historical aspect of his presidency to break the law at will, may be allowed to fundamentally transform America.\nI have been working on Dad, educating him one issue at a time.\nI am working on it.With the biased MSM as his main news source, Dad is a low-info voter."}
