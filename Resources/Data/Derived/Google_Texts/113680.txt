A woman who botched dental procedures is facing felony assault and other charges after investigators found out she was not a licensed doctor.

Valbona Yzeiraj, 45, worked as an office manager at Dr. Jeffrey Schoengold’s office at 3800 Independent Ave., according to Bronx DA Robert Johnson.

“Dr. Val” claimed to have received medical training in her native Albania, but is not licensed to practice medicine in the U.S.

Yzeiraj performed procedures in 2012 and 2013 that left a root canal patient with an infection, and another with “persistent pain” two years after the procedure.

Schoengold fired Yzeiraj after he found she was practicing on patients when he was out of the office, but prosecutors said she tried to take money from the office.

Yzeiraj pleaded not guilty to charges of assault in the second and third degrees, unauthorized practice, attempted grand larceny and reckless endangerment.
