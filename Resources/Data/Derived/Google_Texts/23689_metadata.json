The Social Security Disability Insurance trust fund could run out of money in as soon as two years, government officials say.\n\n\u201cWe should fulfill our promises to the men and women who serve, but we need to streamline these duplicative programs,\u201d said Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., who requested the study.\n\nVeterans groups disagree. They say the retirement money was earned for years of service in the military, while disability payments are compensation for service-related injuries and wounds.\n\nIn most cases, veterans who receive a combination of benefits are severely disabled. About 4 in 5 veterans who got triple payments had a disability rating of at least 50 percent, the GAO said. Nearly half of those receiving triple payments were at least 60 years old.\n\nLouis Celli Jr., a Washington representative for the American Legion, said critics of the multiple benefits are \u201cmisguided and uninformed.\u201d He said the report \u201cshould simply be filed in the category of one of Sen. Coburn\u2019s parting shots to loyal upstanding American patriots who have sacrificed so much for this country.\u201d\n\nCoburn, a longtime critic of government spending, is retiring at the end of the year. He said in an interview that the report raises legitimate questions about whether disability benefits are getting to those who truly need them.\n\n\u201cThis is billions of dollars a year in duplicative payments,\u201d Coburn said. \u201cWe ought to reassess and say, `Are we doing more than take care of people in need?\u2019 I\u2019m not against the military. I don\u2019t think they should be triple dipping.\u201d\n\nMost Americans would find it hard to understand how someone making $86,000 a year in tax-exempt VA income qualifies for Social Security Disability Insurance, when civilian workers are disqualified from the program if they make as little as $13,000 a year, Coburn said.\n\nOnly 17 percent of those who received multiple forms of compensation had suffered a combat-related disability, according to the GAO.\n\nVeterans have long been exempted from rules that deny Social Security benefits to anyone with other income exceeding $13,000 a year.\n\nBut until the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, veterans were barred from receiving both military retirement pay and Department of Veterans Affairs\u2019 disability benefits. Under a Civil War-era statute, the Pentagon docked retirement pay dollar-for-dollar up to the amount of disability benefits from the VA.\n\nWith bipartisan support, Congress changed that law in 2002, gradually restoring military retirement pay to veterans also drawing disability benefits from the VA.\n\n\u201cOur nation\u2019s status as the world\u2019s only superpower is largely due to the sacrifices our veterans made in the last century,\u201d Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., said in March 2002 when the bill was being debated.\n\n\u201cRather than honoring their commitment and bravery by fulfilling our obligations, the federal government has chosen to perpetuate this longstanding injustice,\u201d Reid said. \u201cQuite simply, this is disgraceful and we must correct it.\u201d\n\nAt the time, then-Sen. John Warner, R-Va., a former Navy secretary, posed a question to fellow senators: \u201cHow can we ask the men and women who have so faithfully served to sacrifice a portion of their retirement because they are also receiving compensation for an injury suffered while serving their country?\u201d\n\nWarner acknowledged that the change would have \u201csignificant cost,\u201d but added; \u201cIs the cost too high? I think not.\u201d\n\nAbout 3 percent of the nation\u2019s 1.9 million military retirees collect all three benefits, the GAO said.\n\nThe report did not recommend changes to the program. The VA said in a response that it \u201cgenerally agrees\u201d with the report\u2019s conclusions.
