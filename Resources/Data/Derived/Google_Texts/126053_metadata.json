He does not use the term as popularly conceived, e.g. rationing under Obamacare. Rather, he refers to triage boards in organ transplant medicine. From, \u201cDeath Panels: Can We Handle the Truth?\u201d\n\nIn December, I defended the term \u201cdeath panel\u201d on this blog. Specifically, I demonstrated that we already have, and for over 50 years have had, quite a number of tribunals that act as death panels. For example, at least daily, UNOS denies potentially life-saving organ transplant requests. While the term \u201cdeath panel\u201d has a pejorative connotation, the essential concept and function is necessary. Particularly in situations of strict scarcity, life and death decisions must be made. They are made. And they will continue to be made.\n\nBut that isn\u2019t what people are concerned about in the Obamacare death panel debate, particularly since organ triage is generally based on the individual circumstances of each patient, not pre-determined invidiously via bureaucratically decreed category.\n\nStill, Pope seems to support death panels beyond organ transplant triage, as conceived by Bill Gates\u2013whose opinion I criticized here last week. This, even though we don\u2019t have \u201cstrict scarcity\u201d regarding interventions such as end-of-life care\n\nBill Gates rightly observed that we must deny even effective and life-saving medical technology to some people\u2026 Death panels, while tragic, save lives. And their existence, while grotesque and incomprehensible to many, saves lives. We don\u2019t want the truth, because deep down in places we don\u2019t talk about at parties, we want death panels.\n\nNo, death panels aren\u2019t necessary in the this context, and will not \u201csave lives\u201d\u2013particularly when we are expanding coverage for non essentials and life-style enhancers.\n\nLet\u2019s see, life extending cancer chemo or Viagra? Not a tough choice.\n\nCLICK LIKE IF YOU\u2019RE PRO-LIFE!\n\nBut I agree with Pope. Get this debate out in the open. It is the only way to stop true technocracy-controlled death panels from ever being formed.\n\nLifeNews.com Note: Wesley J.
