ORANGEBURG, S.C. (AP) â€” A white man who was the police chief in a small South Carolina town has been charged with murder in the 2011 shooting death of an unarmed black man.

Richard Combs worked in Eutawville when 54-year-old Bernard Bailey came to Town Hall to argue about his daughter's broken-taillight ticket. Combs and Bailey briefly fought, and the police chief shot Bailey twice in the chest.
