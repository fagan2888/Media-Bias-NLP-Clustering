Thad Cochran and state Sen. Chris McDaniel has seen both outside groups and the campaigns themselves get locked into an advertising war centered on two big issues: federal spending and the conservative credentials of both candidates.\n\nShould voters on Tuesday give another six years to a senator who\u2019s brought billions of dollars in spending from Washington? Or should the keys be handed over to an attorney and former radio host who promises to be a real conservative representing the nation\u2019s poorest state?\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nCochran\u2019s advertising strategy now is almost all about what he can do for the state and his sway over federal dollars. Since he hasn\u2019t faced such a tough race in a long time, he\u2019s re-introducing himself to many voters and reminding them what\u2019s he done for them.\n\nOne ad that the campaign has run in heavy circulation in the past week, called \u201cMore For Mississippi,\u201d shows Cochran sitting in the living room of his Oxford, Miss., cabin and talks up his past work to support \u201cour aerospace industry, shipbuilding, military bases, research and development and agricultural breakthroughs.\u201d The screen lists twenty institutions or companies that have benefited from federal largess, including \u201cCatfish and Cotton Research\u201d in Stoneville, Miss.\n\n\u201cThad Cochran\u2019s strong leadership makes it happen. He\u2019s a powerful voice for our state. Let\u2019s keep him working for us,\u201d the narrator intones.\n\nThere\u2019s not one mention of \u201cconservative\u201d in the ad, which may be indicative of an apparent strategy to get moderate Republicans and Democrats to vote for him in Tuesday\u2019s run-off.\n\nCochran\u2019s ads, made by Stuart Stevens\u2019 firm Strategic Partners & Media and Frontier Strategies run by Quinton Dickerson and Josh Gregory, play heavily on the senator\u2019s personal likeability and easy-going nature.\n\nBut Cochran\u2019s campaign also recently released a harsh attack ad against McDaniel with clips of him saying things on his former radio show such as: \u201cIt\u2019s so interesting to see this woman, basically using her \u2026 breasts to run for office\u201d and \u201cMamacita. Hey hot momma. \u2026 You\u2019re a fine looking young thing.\u201d\n\nThe ad ends with McDaniel yelling \u201cI\u2019m not done! I\u2019m not done!\u201d and the narrator assertively says: \u201cChris McDaniel \u2013 You are done,\u201d the last three words highlighted in red text.\n\n\u201cMcDaniel spent hundreds of hours on radio,\u201d said a Cochran campaign source. \u201cAbout 10 hours have come out so far, the rest would be were he the nominee. And people can make their own decision about what they think of it, and whether or not it\u2019s what they want in their next senator.\u201d\n\nHis campaign has also shifted away from previous ads that hit hot-button conservative issues. Before the primary, it ran ads bragging about his opposition to \u201cObamacare\u201d and that he had been endorsed by the NRA.\n\n\u201c[They are trying] to change the electorate to bring in more liberal Democrats,\u201d said a McDaniel campaign source. \u201cThey have focused much more on sort of a more general-election type strategy, reaching out to Democrats, much less on ideology.\u201d Democrats who didn\u2019t vote in their June 3 primary are eligible to vote in the runoff.\n\nAll these ads have inundated the state in recent days and weeks, and it\u2019s hard for voters to get a respite from them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a total barrage,\u201d said Dan Davis, president of Jackson-based political consulting firm Southern Research Group, some of whose clients support Cochran. On Wednesday night when watching a local TV news program, he saw three ads in a row: one Cochran, one McDaniel, and one McDaniel supporting super PAC.\n\nWith the race neck-and-neck and only a small number of voters who haven\u2019t made up their minds, the ads saturating the airwaves are targeting an exceedingly small number of people while at the same time reminding supporters to show up.\n\nMcDaniel\u2019s campaign ads have largely touched on national themes, instead of spelling out what specifically he would do for voters. McDaniel drew flack for telling POLITICO in February that relief for Hurricane Katrina would not have been \u201can easy vote to cast.\u201d\n\nThe one ad that McDaniel\u2019s campaign currently has on the air, created by the firm Cold Spark Media, has upbeat music and tells the viewer they made history on June 3. The words \u201cEndorsed by Sarah Palin\u201d appear on the screen in the final few seconds.\n\n\u201cChris McDaniel is a proven conservative leader with an agenda for Mississippi: repeal Obamacare entirely, reduce the national debt, cut taxes and term limits for all our politicians,\u201d the narrator says.\n\nMcDaniel knows that voters who care most about federal projects probably aren\u2019t going to back him. So his ads attempt to frame the choice in terms more favorable to him.\n\n\u201cYou have to figure out what your message is, you have to figure what message works, and you need to hammer that message home and everything else is a distraction,\u201d said the McDaniel source.\n\nFeeling the wind at their backs, outside groups supporting McDaniel with advertising are similarly emphasizing ideology over state-specific issues. One of the groups spending the most money is the Club for Growth, which is putting money into radio ads and mailers as well as traditional television spots.\n\nTheir ad playing now, called \u201cEntitled,\u201d has a somber female narrator saying: \u201cIt\u2019s sad what happened to Thad Cochran. He served well but after five decades he\u2019s lost touch.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn Washington, he votes with the liberals on spending, on judges, even on funding Obamacare\u201d and shows pictures of Harry Reid, President Obama and Nancy Pelosi to try to tie Cochran to people deeply unpopular in Mississippi. The ad\u2019s faint background shows Obama\u2019s campaign logo.\n\nThe ad doesn\u2019t mention Cochran\u2019s opposition to the ACA before and since it passed.\n\nA key statistic that\u2019s cited in some of the anti-Cochran ads is his number of years in Washington: 41. The figure seems to suggests to voters that they should think Cochran, at 76, is too old for another term, although the ads don\u2019t say that outright because Cochran is personally very likeable in the state.\n\nVery conservative groups such as Our Country Deserves Better PAC, Senate Conservatives PAC, Family Research Council\u2019s PAC and The Madison Project have also jumped into the action against him.\n\nThe most unusual ad? The \u201cNow or Never PAC\u201d is spending $90,000 on a radio spot that capitalizes on Cochran\u2019s comment last week that he did \u201call kinds of indecent things with animals\u201d as a kid growing up.\n\nThe ad uses the audio of Cochran\u2019s comment and adds the loud sound \u201cBaaaahhh.\u201d The narrator then says: \u201cTell Thad Cochran you\u2019re no farm animal. And you are not going to take being on the receiving end of his so-called fun any longer.\u201d\n\nThe Cochran campaign source said that outside groups were attempting a \u201chostile takeover of the state so they can own it.\u201d But Cochran has received outside support too.\n\nGroups like the National Association of Realtors and the U.S. Chamber of Congress that have a financial stake in Cochran remaining in office are also on the air, with the Chamber bringing in a big-time closer: NFL legend Brett Favre.\n\nHowever, one pro-Cochran group, the Mississippi Conservatives PAC, has stepped away from TV advertising in the campaign\u2019s final days.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more important to put our money into organization than it is to put into TV ads,\u201d said Henry Barbour, who runs the PAC and is the nephew of former Miss. governor Haley Barbour. \u201cWe don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to flip a lot of people at this point. It\u2019s a whole lot more about turning people out and identifying people that did not vote last time.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe organization, frankly, in the primary [last time around] was just weak, and part of that was just complacency, and the McDaniel campaign was very energized [with its] people working hard,\u201d he said.\n\nThe PAC, however, is putting in targeted small amounts of money on mailers, Internet radio ads and Facebook ads, according to FEC records. The message they\u2019re driving is the same as the Cochran campaign: he brings home the bacon.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The fight is centered on federal spending and the conservative credentials of both candidates.", "og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The fight is centered on federal spending and the conservative credentials of both candidates.", "title": "The Cochran-McDaniel ad wars", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/06/thad-cochran-chris-mcdaniel-ads-federal-spending-conservative-credentials-108180.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/05/29/140529_thad_cochran_chris_mcdaniel_ap_605.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "keywords": "Elections,Thad Cochran,2014 Elections,Campaigns,Chris McDaniel,Political Ads,Campaign Ads", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/daniellippman"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1a98\"", "article_summary": "\u201c[They are trying] to change the electorate to bring in more liberal Democrats,\u201d said a McDaniel campaign source.\nThe message they\u2019re driving is the same as the Cochran campaign: he brings home the bacon.\nThe PAC, however, is putting in targeted small amounts of money on mailers, Internet radio ads and Facebook ads, according to FEC records.\n\u201cMcDaniel spent hundreds of hours on radio,\u201d said a Cochran campaign source.\nMcDaniel\u2019s campaign ads have largely touched on national themes, instead of spelling out what specifically he would do for voters."}
