Courtesy photo\n\nAs CEO of the Lebanon-based Dartmouth-Hitchcock system, Dr. James N. Weinstein undoubtedly has a unique perspective on what ails New Hampshire\u2019s, and the nation\u2019s, health care system.\n\nWeinstein oversees a $1.6 billion health care system that includes Dartmouth-Hitchcock medical center, a network of clinics in New Hampshire and Vermont and a partnership with the state\u2019s only medical school, the Geisel School of Medicine, that serves a patient population of 1.5 million.\n\nUnder his leadership, Dartmouth-Hitchcock has worked to forge partnerships with other providers throughout the region, all part of his effort to create a \u201csustainable health system\u201d \u2013 a system that offers the best care to patients at a lower cost.\n\nQ. How do you see the state of health care in New Hampshire today?\n\nA. I see the state as an opportunity, in the sense that we need some new models to deliver care in New Hampshire, and I think the models we\u2019re working on with Dartmouth-Hitchcock have local, regional and national implications.\n\nWhat we need to create in New Hampshire is a sustainable health system, not a healthcare system, and we need to do that with three particular strategies. It would have to be population-based \u2013 what do the people of New Hampshire need, not what the health care systems offer. And we need to offer the infrastructure that provides the lowest cost to the most people.\n\nHealth care is not a business with a financial model that we should be thinking about in the traditional sense. It\u2019s about real people that have real problems. Whether it\u2019s a Boston hospital or a Salem hospital or a North Country hospital, we need to be thinking about what system we can best integrate to have the best resources and use the best resources.\n\nQ. What do you mean by a population-based system?\n\nA. By population-based, I mean it\u2019s not market-based. We need to be looking at people across communities, not just at specific geographical locations that some would call a market share strategy. Right now, the fee-for-service model is a competitive, market-driven model. I don\u2019t think that creates a sustainable health system for New Hampshire or any state.\n\nWhat we need is to determine how to aggregate and bring communities together to the benefit of many and the detriment of none. We need to focus on value, not volume, and create a system that makes patients well-informed and only provides them with what they want and need.\n\nQ. Is that what Dartmouth-Hitchcock and other providers are aiming for with your ventures with Harvard Pilgrim Health Care?\n\nA. Those partnerships, Benevera Health and Elevate Health, are good examples of a population-based, value-based strategy that creates a sustainable health system. We are looking at what the population needs, and provide those services at a premium so the cost is lower to the consumer than it is on the market.\n\nThey involve bringing together a not-for-profit health plan, like Harvard Pilgrim, and a not-for-profit health care system, like Dartmouth-Hitchcock, to create a high-value, low-cost, sustainable health system \u2013 not a health care system.\n\nQ. Is this model being used elsewhere?\n\nA. Others are trying to create it. There are systems that have health plans and they take care of populations in their plans. They are trying to do this with the Blues, Cigna, Medicare and Medicaid. But above all, payer engagement is very important if we are truly going to achieve a population-based health system.\n\nQ. By \u201cpayer engagement,\u201d for the most part you mean employers.\n\nA. This is crucial to understand. New Hampshire employers know better than anyone that the health system we have today is unsustainable. The issue in New Hampshire is to allow small businesses to grow and young people to stay in the state and grow more jobs. I think creating a sustainable health system is part of creating a new economy in the region. It will allow small businesses to spend less for health care so they can then spend more money on jobs for more people.\n\nQ. Did the Affordable Care Act have anything to do with making this move toward a sustainable health care system?\n\nA. The ACA was a happy coincidence. We were on this path before the ACA came into being. But I worry about the ACA not being sustainable because if the federal government stops supporting expanded Medicaid enrollment, the model is not sustainable.\n\nThe point is, we have to create a sustainable system for New Hampshire, whether the government supports it or not.\n\nQ. It seems like a tall order.\n\nA. In my mind, this isn\u2019t just about health care. What I believe we are doing is creating the next Industrial Revolution that really says, \u201cHow does America, and New Hampshire, move into the next several decades with high rates of employment, new jobs and a bright future?\u201d\n\nThis is much bigger than just the health care system. We have been winnowing away at the \u201cNew Hampshire advantage.\u201d What we need to do is create a future for the state that is vibrant and growing.\n\nThink about it: The cost of health care has long been an economic challenge in New Hampshire, but after we address the health care system, we can then begin to address the education system, and create a stronger economy. I\u2019m talking about housing, I\u2019m talking about education, the economy.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"app_id": 357619467597909}, "description": "\u2018Creating a sustainable health system is part of creating a new economy in the region.
