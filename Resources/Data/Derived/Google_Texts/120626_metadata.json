Supporters of the A.C.A. have argued in favor of expanding the insurance program Medicaid to cover adults who earn up to 138 percent of the poverty level\u2014but so far twenty-one states have decided against such an expansion. For the most part, governors of those states have given the same explanation: they simply cannot afford to pay for their share of the program.\n\nBut in new research\u2014based on decades of previously confidential data\u2014Kellogg School assistant professor of strategy Craig Garthwaite and his coauthors find that when the population of uninsured Americans increases, hospitals end up bearing the cost by providing uncompensated care. In fact, their results suggest that each additional uninsured person costs local hospitals $900 per year.\n\nThat means hospitals are effectively serving as \u201cinsurers of last resort\u201d within the American healthcare sector by providing care to uninsured patients who cannot afford to pay their medical bills. \u201cPeople are still going to the emergency room,\u201d Garthwaite says, \u201cand they are still receiving treatment\u2014so the cost is still there. When governments do not provide health insurance, hospitals must effectively provide it instead.\u201d\n\nInsurers of Last Resort\n\nDemand for uncompensated care is what Garthwaite calls relatively \u201cinelastic\u201d\u2014it remains constant regardless of changes in healthcare supply. To demonstrate this, he and his coauthors Tal Gross of Columbia University and Matthew Notowidigdo of Northwestern University looked at 359 hospital closures from 1987 through 2000. Whenever a hospital closed, the uncompensated care costs for nearby hospitals rose significantly, suggesting that there was a nearly complete spillover effect. \u201cAgain, the cost does not go away,\u201d Garthwaite says. \u201cIt\u2019s passed on to the remaining hospitals.\u201d\n\n\u201cPreviously, it wasn\u2019t clear exactly what kind of role nonprofit hospitals were playing. This demonstrates that they\u2019re serving to fill in the gaps in the social safety net.\u201d\n\nRelated Reading Freed from Employment Lock Obamacare may lead people to choose to leave the labor market Plenty of Costs, Plenty of Benefits A Q&A with Craig Garthwaite about the new insurance exchanges How Poverty Damages Health Anti-poverty programs boost recipients\u2019 well-being\n\nThe spillover arises because the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, passed in 1985, requires that hospitals treat all individuals in need of emergency care regardless of their insurance status.\n\nThe government does provide some compensation to hospitals for treating low-income patients. Most of it is in the form of Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) payments, which, according to federal law, are owed to any qualified hospital that serves a large number of Medicaid and uninsured patients. But the research shows it is not enough to offset hospital costs. \u201cThe DSH payments are less than the uncompensated care that\u2019s provided,\u201d explains Garthwaite.\n\nNor does the cost fall on those who hold private insurance policies, as many policymakers assume. \u201cThere\u2019s this idea that hospitals simply pass on the costs of uncompensated care to privately insured patients by raising prices,\u201d Garthwaite says\u2014a phenomenon known as \u201ccost-shifting,\u201d which some have also interpreted as a \u201chidden tax\u201d on all Americans.\n\n\u201cWe show evidence that it\u2019s not true. If it were true, we wouldn\u2019t see profits fall\u2014but we see profits fall meaningfully following an increase in the share of the population that is uninsured.\u201d Beyond the empirical evidence, though, Garthwaite says it is not clear that hospitals could shift costs in the way many policymakers assume they do. \u201cHospitals are sophisticated financial organizations,\u201d he says. \u201cIf raising prices would have made them more money, they would have already raised prices.\u201d\n\nUltimately, hospitals are left to absorb at least two-thirds of the cost of all of this uncompensated care, the researchers estimate.\n\nBurden on Nonprofits\n\nInterestingly, nonprofit hospitals end up absorbing the bulk of this care. A majority of private hospitals in the United States\u2014more than 70 percent\u2014are nonprofit firms and therefore expected to provide a \u201ccommunity benefit\u201d in exchange for tax relief. One key component of this community benefit is charity care for indigent patients. For-profit firms do not face a similar community-benefit standard.\n\nThis means that when there are changes in the supply or demand of healthcare services to the poor, most of the burden\u2014in terms of uncompensated care costs\u2014falls on nonprofit hospitals, a finding that sheds new light on the role nonprofits play in the healthcare industry. In contrast to what many believe, nonprofit hospitals are not simply for-profits in disguise. \u201cPreviously, it wasn\u2019t clear exactly what kind of role nonprofit hospitals were playing,\u201d he says. \u201cThis demonstrates that they\u2019re serving to fill in the gaps in the social safety net.\u201d\n\nThe authors note that this burden on hospitals should not be seen as a foregone conclusion that results from health care being a necessary service. \u201cGrocery stores also sell a vital product that is partially financed by the government through food stamps,\u201d Garthwaite says. \u201cBut grocery stores that accept food stamps are not required to provide \u2018uncompensated food\u2019 for people who aren\u2019t eligible for food stamps or who have already used their monthly benefits.\u201d In both cases\u2014healthcare and food stamps\u2014the government deals with private firms to offer this assistance, but only in the healthcare sector do private firms incur costs beyond what the government compensates for.\n\nThe Costs of Disenrollment\n\nThe fact that hospitals, not governments, bear this cost has profound implications for the debate over Medicaid expansion. For evidence of what happens when millions of people lose their insurance, Garthwaite and his coauthors look at two recent case studies of large-scale disenrollment.\n\nIn 2005, citing severe budget constraints, Missouri and Tennessee both chose to cut back their public insurance programs. The disenrollments had a significant impact on local hospitals. In Missouri, whose program mostly supported low-income parents, the cost of uncompensated care was estimated at $556\u2013786 for each newly uninsured citizen. In Tennessee\u2014where four percent of the non-elderly population lost its public insurance\u2014the uncompensated care cost reached $1,048\u20131,678. (Tennessee\u2019s population was more costly because it included people who could afford to buy their way onto the state health insurance, but who may have had preexisting conditions).\n\nGiven that public insurance benefits hospitals as much low-income patients, it is no wonder that hospital groups are lobbying for its expansion. \u201cWe even see state hospital associations offering to pay more taxes,\u201d Garthwaite says. \u201cYou don\u2019t hear industry organizations say that very often.\u201d\n\nGarthwaite says this research was meant to understand the true cost of public insurance programs. \u201cWe want a debate about the Affordable Care Act and the Medicaid expansion and public insurance in general to be based on economic facts,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are people who say it costs too much. What do we mean when we say it costs too much?\u201d\n\nFor policymakers who want to balance state budgets while also offering public health insurance, factoring in the costs of uncompensated care might help them make more informed decisions about how to design statewide programs. \u201cThere will always be a minimum level of care that people are going to consume,\u201d Garthwaite says. \u201cSo we need to have a conversation about how to most efficiently provide that care\u2014otherwise we\u2019re left with sloppy arguments. Choosing to ignore this population doesn\u2019t mean the cost of that care is ever going to go away.\u201d\n\nPhoto credit belongs to Taber Andrew Bain.
