Tucson Police are investigating a body found at Kennedy Park on the city's southwest side. Sgt. Pete Dugan says officers were called out shortly before 1 p.m. Saturday, and when they arrived, they found the body of a man in his 20s.





The area near Ajo and Mission is taped off right now as crime scene investigators are gathering information.







Dugan says there are no signs of foul play and that they are not treating the case as a homicide. The man is apparently known as a transient.
