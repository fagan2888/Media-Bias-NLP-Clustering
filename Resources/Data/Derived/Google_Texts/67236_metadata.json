Bankrupt, the hospital recently sold to South Nassau Communities Hospital in nearby Oceanside.\n\nThere is little access to emergency services for the beachfront community of Long Beach \u2013 the medical center was the only hospital on the thin barrier island, which has just three exit points to nearby towns.\n\nMany Long Beach residents felt another hospital should be built in its place. But Mark Bogen, senior vice president of finance and CFO at South Nassau, said his organization disagrees, and they\u2019re using demand forecasting to help them make the decision.\n\n[See also: Forecasts for future health spending.]\n\nBefore Hurricane Sandy, only 50 percent of residents used the emergency department, Bogen said. Only 35 percent sought inpatient care there and less than 10 percent used the hospital when needing surgery of any kind. According to Crain\u2019s New York Business, revenue during the year before the storm was $55 million, not enough to cover its $59 million in expenses.\n\nAfter the storm, the community of more than 30,000 full-time residents shrunk: Nearly one-quarter of residents never returned, choosing to stay full-time in their winter homes in the South. Since then, the community has tried to bring in young families to fill the gaps.\n\n\u201cWe need to know how to bring in services but do it in a financially responsible way,\u201d Bogen said. \u201cOur belief is that with changing tides of healthcare reform where so much is moving to outpatient care, the need to build a hospital is not really there.\u201d\n\nWe see fewer inpatient bed need models than before \u2013 not too many hospitals are looking to expand.\n\nAdam Powell, consultant and president of Payer+Provider Syndicate, recently worked with a healthcare client to determine a staff development plan based on potential demand in 2014 and 2019. He examined the organization\u2019s primary service area population, its market share and out-of-area draw to determine its potential patient volume. Then he calculated how many physicians would be needed to treat that population to get an idea of potential physician demand.\n\nThe organization had estimated what the demand would be, but working through the process officially gave them a lot of data and a consistent picture to back up their assumptions, he said.\n\nDemand forecasting can be used to understand staffing needs, determine if beds need to be added or subtracted, if new hospitals or freestanding facilities should be built or if service lines can be introduced or removed. Hugo Finarelli, Jr., senior vice president of Health Strategies and Solutions Inc., said some of the more common forecasting his organization sees now include demand assessments for freestanding emergency rooms and ambulatory care centers, and understanding the need for specialty services like bone marrow transplants or pediatric heart transplants.\n\n[See also: Recession, reform disrupt hospital strategic planning efforts.]\n\n\u201cWe see fewer inpatient bed need models than before \u2013 not too many hospitals are looking to expand,\u201d he said. \u201cOrganizations want to understand freestanding ED services and physician needs if they are going to get into population health management.\u201d\n\nFinarelli said demand forecasting can help predict trends for at least three years, but not much longer than five years out. Once you get beyond five years in a changing industry like healthcare, \u201cyou are just guessing,\u201d he said.\n\nBobbi Brown, vice president of finance for Health Catalyst, a data warehousing and analytics group based in Salt Lake City, said much of this data can be created in-house. Information on metrics like use rates can be gathered from Medicare, payers or professional societies, she said. The planning department or finance staff can gather the information, and the whole management team must sign off on assumptions regarding things like population growth and technology development.\n\n\u201cYou have to look at the data and \u2018beat up on it\u2019 with higher-ups to understand what will help get the population that we serve the services they need,\u201d Brown said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/healthcare-providers-increase-reliance-demand-forecasting", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/generic-hospital-building-feature.gif", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "An increasing number of healthcare organizations are turning to demand forecasting, crunching numbers to help them determine potential device usage, patient demand and even to decide whether or not to build new facilities.", "title": "Healthcare providers increase reliance on demand forecasting"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/generic-hospital-building-feature.gif"}, "description": "An increasing number of healthcare organizations are turning to demand forecasting, crunching numbers to help them determine potential device usage, patient demand and even to decide whether or not to build new facilities.", "site": "@HC_Finance", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Healthcare providers increase reliance on demand forecasting"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Predicting the future healthcare needs of a community isn\u2019t easy, as demographic shifts and rapid changes in policy can make it hard to see immediate needs, let alone issues down the road.&#13; That\u2019s why more providers are turning to demand forecasting, crunching numbers to help them determine potential device usage, patient demand and even to decide whether or not to build a new healthcare facility.", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd399d\"", "article_summary": "That\u2019s why more providers are turning to demand forecasting, crunching numbers to help them determine potential device usage, patient demand and even to decide whether or not to build a new healthcare facility.\nAn increasing number of healthcare organizations are turning to demand forecasting, crunching numbers to help them determine potential device usage, patient demand and even to decide whether or not to build new facilities.\nBut Mark Bogen, senior vice president of finance and CFO at South Nassau, said his organization disagrees, and they\u2019re using demand forecasting to help them make the decision.\nAdam Powell, consultant and president of Payer+Provider Syndicate, recently worked with a healthcare client to determine a staff development plan based on potential demand in 2014 and 2019.\nThen he calculated how many physicians would be needed to treat that population to get an idea of potential physician demand."}
