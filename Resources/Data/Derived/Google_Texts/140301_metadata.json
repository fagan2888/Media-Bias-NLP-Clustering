They feel as if they had a major systems failure, a major management failure, and they\u2019re trying to get back on track.\"\n\nIt is not the first time that Obama has met with MSNBC hosts at the White House. Last December, he met with Maddow, Al Sharpton, Lawrence O'Donnell and Ed Schultz (Huffington Post editor-in-chief Arianna Huffington was also in the 2012 meeting).\n\n\n\nThis time around, the White House has been embroiled in controversy over Obamacare. The introduction of the health care program has been plagued by healthcare.gov glitches and insurance policy cancellations.\n\nRelated on HuffPost: Barack Obama Style Evolution Barack Obama Style Evolution\n\n1 of 52 1971 Obama (back row) Share this slide:\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Lawrence O'Donnell, Ed Schultz, Ezra Klein and Juan Williams reportedly met with President Obama at the White House on Thursday. \n\nFox News' Ed Henry t...", "sailthru.expire_date": "2013-11-22 15:29:11 -0500", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "Lawrence O'Donnell, Ed Schultz, Ezra Klein and Juan Williams reportedly met with President Obama at the White House on Thursday. \n\nFox News' Ed Henry t...", "title": "MSNBC Hosts, Juan Williams Reportedly Meet With Obama", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/21/msnbc-obama-juan-williams-white-house-meeting_n_4318440.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1027945/images/o-JUAN-WILLIAMS-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HuffPostMedia", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1027945/images/o-JUAN-WILLIAMS-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "description": "Lawrence O'Donnell, Ed Schultz, Ezra Klein and Juan Williams reportedly met with President Obama at the White House on Thursday. \n\nFox News' Ed Henry t...", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "MSNBC Hosts, Juan Williams Reportedly Meet With Obama"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-11-21 15:29:11 -0500", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=4318440", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "media", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "juan williams white house,MSNBC Obama,white house meeting,white house msnbc,Obama MSNBC,white house juan williams,msnbc white house", "article": {"section": "Media", "tag": "juan williams white house,MSNBC Obama,white house meeting,white house msnbc,Obama MSNBC,white house juan williams,msnbc white house", "published_time": "2013-11-21 15:29:11 -0500", "modified_time": "2013-11-22 09:30:20 -0500"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "article_summary": "Related on HuffPost: Barack Obama Style Evolution Barack Obama Style Evolution1 of 52 1971 Obama (back row) Share this slide:\nLawrence O'Donnell, Ed Schultz, Ezra Klein and Juan Williams reportedly met with President Obama at the White House on Thursday.\nIt is not the first time that Obama has met with MSNBC hosts at the White House.\nThis time around, the White House has been embroiled in controversy over Obamacare.\n\"I met with other senior officials at the White House, I can tell you they are in full fight mode over the Affordable Healthcare Act right now,\" he said."}
