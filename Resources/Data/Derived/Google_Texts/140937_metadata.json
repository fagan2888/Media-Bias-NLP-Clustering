Another is a review of what happened during the government\u2019s most recent shutdown, in the mid-1990s.\n\nWhile President Obama and essentially every Capitol Hill lawmakers have expressed their unwillingness to force a shutdown next month -- the deadline is just days away with no sign of a deal between the Democrat-controlled Senate and the Republican-led House, which Obama would have to approve.\n\nAnd the situation -- which typically gets resolved before the deadline -- is further complicated this time by the House voting Friday to pay for everything in the federal budget but the president\u2019s signature health care law, known as ObamaCare.\n\n\u201cWe had victory today,\u201d House Speaker John Boehner said after the vote. \u201cThe House has listened to the American people. Now it's time for the U.S. Senate to listen.\u201d\n\nSuch a plan has effectively no chance of passing the Senate and undoubtedly would be vetoed by Obama, similar to when President Clinton vetoed Congress\u2019 plan in 1995, triggering the country\u2019s longest and most-recent shutdown.\n\nThe shutdown lasted 21 days -- from December 16 to January 1996 -- resulting in the furlough of several hundred thousand federal employees and had a negative impacted that rippled across several sectors of the economy.\n\nPresident Obama said Saturday: \u201cThere\u2019s \u2026 a faction on the far right of the Republican Party who\u2019ve convinced their leadership to threaten a government shutdown if they can\u2019t shut off the Affordable Care Act. Some are actually willing to plunge America into default. \u2026 Well, that\u2019s not happening.\u201d\n\nAmong the other likely and immediate impacts of the shutdown would be the closure of hundreds of national parks, tens of thousands of daily visa applications going unprocessed and hiring freezes for federal law enforcement agencies, according to the advisory.\n\nA prolonged shutdown has the potential to shutter federal courts and other, more essentials services. And Obama warned Saturday that military personnel, including those deployed overseas, will not get their paychecks on time.\n\nEarlier this week, Office of Management and Budget Director Sylvia Burwell sent a letter to federal agencies ordering them to make contingency plans for a possible shutdown.\n\nThe letter stated Congress still has enough time to prevent a lapse in funding but \"prudent management\" requires that the government get ready.\n\nThe letter was also sent as a second Washington battle looms \u2013 negotiations on raising the federal debt ceiling before the country defaults on its debts.\n\n\u201cThe United States of America is not a deadbeat nation,\u201d the president said Saturday in his weekly address. \u201cWe are running out of time to fix this.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"prism.subsection1": "executive", "classification": "/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/EXECUTIVE/Cabinet,/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/EXECUTIVE/Homeland Security,/FOX
