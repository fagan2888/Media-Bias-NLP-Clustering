Once upon a time, though, you had to be slightly more surreptitious if you wanted your music released. The tracks that follow all worm their metaphorical way into your fruit basket, as it were. (And I\u2019ve stuck pretty much to songs that are double entendre all the way through, thus the absence of Led Zeppelin\u2019s \u201cLemon Song\u201d and other numbers that whip out the double entendre for a line or two, but lack the full staying power.)\n\nBo Carter, \u201cPlease Warm My Wiener\u201d\n\n\n\nEarly blues performer Bo Carter often performed with influential string band the Mississippi Sheiks. On his own, he recorded so many double entendres it\u2019s a wonder he could keep his bananas separate from his biscuits. \u201cPlease Warm My Wiener\u201d is one of the juiciest entries in the large genre of double entendre meat songs. They don\u2019t feel right cold.\n\nSwallows, \u201cIt Ain\u2019t the Meat\u201d\n\n\n\nAnother meat song, this delivered by Irving Turner\u2019s baritone fronting the classic vocal group the Swallows. The entendre gets an extra little push of double when it\u2019s couched in the innocent motion of doo-wop.\n\nBessie Smith, \u201cI Need a Little Sugar in My Bowl\u201d\n\n\n\nAs popular as meat may be, the sugary stuff is even more so. Bessie Smith starts out like she\u2019s singing one of her great mournful blues numbers, but she soon gets into the growling, moaning spirit of double entendre. \u201cI need a little mmm-hmmm\u201d speaks for itself. And of course, \u201ccome on hard papa\u201d thrusts right over that line into not needing an entendre at all. (And speaking of avoiding entendre, I would be remiss to not point you to Lucille Bogan\u2019s not at all coy, filthy, filthy blues, \u201cShave \u2018Em Dry.\u201d)\n\nKelis, \u201cMilkshake\u201d\n\n\n\nEven though you can just sing about sex without getting cute, Kelis demonstrates that there\u2019s still a virtue to subtlety \u2014 if \u201csubtlety\u201d is the right word, exactly. The video doesn\u2019t stint on the visual entendres either, from the doubled cherries in the glass to Kelis oscillating her upper bits suggestively as she intones \u201cmilkshake\u201d at the 1 minute mark.\n\nVan Halen, \u201cI\u2019m Your Ice-Cream Man\u201d\n\n\n\nDavid Lee Roth is so oleaginous here that John Brim\u2019s old blues slides out of Chicago all the way to Las Vegas. I think he actually switches the line from \u201cflavors\u201d to \u201cfavors\u201d at the end there, when he\u2019s reiterating what he\u2019s got that will satisfy.\n\nVictoria Spivey and Lonnie Johnson, \u201cToothache Blues\u201d\n\n\n\nThis is where you end up after all those Kelis milkshakes and Van Halen ice creams, I suppose. Blues singer Spivey and jazz guitarist Johnson fill various cavities, provoking moans, groans, and sighs long before Donna Summer. Part 2 goes on in the same vein \u2014 \u201cwhen I start to drilling, momma don\u2019t scream and shout,\u201d\u2026\u201dOh, doctor!\u201d If you just can\u2019t get enough of the dentist, you can check out the similarly themed \u201cLong John Blues\u201d by Dinah Washington.\n\nWynonie Harris, \u201cKeep On Churnin\u2019 (Till the Butter Comes)\u201d\n\n\n\nJump blues shouter Wynonie Harris recorded a number of double entendres, but I think this is the most joyfully shocking in the specificity of its lubrication metaphor. It also manages to be a kind of double double entendre, touching (if that\u2019s the right word) on both food and animals, the most popular topics for outrageous innuendo.\n\nLightnin\u2019 Hopkins, \u201cLet Me Play With Your Poodle\u201d\n\n\n\nWestern swing performer Hank Penny also recorded the song, but I think Lightnin\u2019 Hopkins\u2019 wonderfully rollicking version suits best the theme of rollicking with that thing. Hopkins makes sure you know that he means \u201cyou little poodle dog,\u201d not whatever else it was you were thinking of.\n\nThe Cramps, \u201cDaisys Up Your Butterfly\u201d\n\n\n\nLux Interior does his Elvis impersonation on a cracked retro-rockabilly double entendre that I\u2019m pretty sure Elvis wouldn\u2019t have wanted any part of. \u201cI myself believe in whatever comes in handy,\u201d indeed.", "article_metadata": {"description": "From \"It Ain't the Meat\" to \"Let Me Play with Your Poodle,\" the sneakiest sex songs in the history of music VIDEO", "author": "Noah Berlatsky", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "From \"It Ain't the Meat\" to \"Let Me Play with Your Poodle,\" the sneakiest sex songs in the history of music VIDEO", "title": "The 19 greatest double entendre songs", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/28/the_19_greatest_double_entendre_songs/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/prince2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "From \"It Ain't the Meat\" to \"Let Me Play with Your Poodle,\" the sneakiest sex songs in the history of music VIDEO", "creator": "@hoodedu", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/prince2.jpg", "title": "The 19 greatest double entendre songs", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "The 19 greatest double entendre songs", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, aerosmith, Bo Carter, Editor's Picks, lists, Music, OutKast, Prince, Van Halen, Video", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0390\"", "article_summary": "\u201cPlease Warm My Wiener\u201d is one of the juiciest entries in the large genre of double entendre meat songs.\nIt also manages to be a kind of double double entendre, touching (if that\u2019s the right word) on both food and animals, the most popular topics for outrageous innuendo.\n(And I\u2019ve stuck pretty much to songs that are double entendre all the way through, thus the absence of Led Zeppelin\u2019s \u201cLemon Song\u201d and other numbers that whip out the double entendre for a line or two, but lack the full staying power.)\nThe Cramps, \u201cDaisys Up Your Butterfly\u201dLux Interior does his Elvis impersonation on a cracked retro-rockabilly double entendre that I\u2019m pretty sure Elvis wouldn\u2019t have wanted any part of.\nBessie Smith starts out like she\u2019s singing one of her great mournful blues numbers, but she soon gets into the growling, moaning spirit of double entendre."}
