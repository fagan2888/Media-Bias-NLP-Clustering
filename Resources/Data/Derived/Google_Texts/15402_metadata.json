But Democrats don\u2019t control Congress, and won\u2019t control it again until Obama is no longer president. Under the circumstances, it stands to reason that when Obama proposes progressive policies like these, he\u2019s playing a longer game\u2014guiding Democrats on the Hill as they battle against Republican budgets, or laying out a menu of policies for his successor, who might have better luck with Congress.\n\nThe Atlantic\u2019s David Frum, once a speechwriter for President George W. Bush, posits that Obama\u2019s real aim in proposing policies he knows Republicans will reject is to limit Hillary Clinton\u2019s options, lest she be tempted to regress toward a mushier centrism. \u201cEvery time the president advances a concept that thrills his party\u2019s liberal base, he creates a dilemma for Hillary Clinton. Does she agree or not? Any time she is obliged to answer, her scope to define herself is constricted,\u201d Frum explains. \u201cObama\u2019s highest priority over the next two years seems to be \u2026 to force Hillary Clinton to campaign and govern on his terms.\u201d\n\nThis would be a more compelling argument if the White House and the burgeoning Clinton campaign weren\u2019t closely aligned\u2014if Obama were promoting ideas that offended Hillary Clinton\u2019s brain trust, or if his consigliere, John Podesta, wasn\u2019t leaving the White House to staff up and guide the Clinton campaign. Frum assumes that Clinton, the 2016 candidate, will see the country\u2019s political challenges no differently than when she ran for president before the economic crisis in 2008, or when she represented New York state as a senator for two terms starting in 2001.\n\nMost of the evidence points in a different direction. Yet if Obama and Clinton are more closely aligned than people assume, he wouldn\u2019t need to use his State of the Union to confine her, but rather to begin the process of priming the public for her campaign. And that\u2019s not strictly a matter of testing voter appetite for various policy ideas, but of building a case before the public that Democrats have had better economic ideas all along and that a Democratic approach to national policy deserves to reap the benefits of incumbency.\n\nTuesday\u2019s State of the Union was thus a single component of a project that\u2019s much more meaningful than budget brinksmanship or the 2016 campaign\u2014to establish the parameters of the economic debate for years and years, the way Ronald Reagan\u2019s presidency lent supply-side tax policy and deregulation a presumption of efficacy that shaped not just Republican, but Democratic policy for two decades.\n\nSeven years into Obama's presidency, the U.S. economy is finally growing rapidly enough to boost his popularity and to sell the country on the idea that Obama\u2019s peculiar brand of ostentatious incrementalism\u2014building out and improving existing institutions, directing resources through them to the middle class\u2014has worked, and should serve as a beacon not just for liberals, but for conservatives aspiring to recapture the presidency.\n\n\"At every step, we were told our goals were misguided or too ambitious; that we would crush jobs and explode deficits,\" Obama said. \"Instead, we\u2019ve seen the fastest economic growth in over a decade, our deficits cut by two-thirds, a stock market that has doubled, and health care inflation at its lowest rate in fifty years.\"\n\nThis is a depressing possibility for Obama\u2019s political nemeses, including for progressives who believe his administration has been too solicitous of Wall Street and business interests and thus too encumbered\u2014or even tainted\u2014to topple corrupt systems and replace them with ones that respond to public needs.\n\nThey are right to be depressed. Because Republicans will excitedly reject them, the liberal policies Obama outlined in his address have come in for the most attention. But none of them is particularly radical. The remainder of Obama\u2019s presidency, as outlined Tuesday, will leave us no closer to a fundamental restructuring of Wall Street, or to economic institutions that will distribute income and wealth much more evenly.\n\nBut it could have been much worse. Republicans spent the entirety of Obama\u2019s first term (and most of his second) in the grip of a prophesy that every one of Obama\u2019s significant achievements would contribute to an American cataclysm. That these predictions haven\u2019t materialized now makes it easier for Obama to champion his own legacy at conservatism's expense.\n\nIt could have turned out much differently for Democrats, though. If Mitt Romney had won the presidency in 2012 and caught the wave of economic growth we\u2019re now experiencing\u2014after cutting both income taxes and domestic spending, and eliminating the Affordable Care Act\u2014conservatives would have draped him in Reagan\u2019s cloak, and the public would have warmed once again to the kinds of policies that George W. Bush\u2019s presidency briefly discredited.\n\nObama wants his presidency to pay the same dividends. Tonight we got a glimpse of what it will look like if and when Democrats ultimately cash in.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "These are lines President Barack Obama hoped to deliver years ago.\"The verdict is clear,\" he said in Tuesday night's State of the Union address. \"Middle-class economics works.
