And the resulting volume, Crippled America, very much reads like a book that was written in three months while its author spent most of his time doing other things.\n\nCrippled America is a child\u2019s book report on Donald Trump: conversational in tone and remarkably low on detail. It is the novelization of a five-month campaign spent filling stadiums and offering bold pronouncements with very little supporting information. It is exactly the book on Trump\u2019s candidacy we might have expected, and undoubtedly the book we deserve.\n\nThe lack of specifics\u2014or even a basic grasp of our reality\u2014offered by Trump\u2019s broadly defined platform has been a major criticism of his campaign, and this book will do nothing to quiet that criticism. In 169 pages, you will not find any details, or vagaries, that he hasn\u2019t already articulated on The View or Morning Joe.\n\nLike how Trump believes the U.S. should \u201cget back the jobs we\u2019ve lost to other countries\u201d:\n\nAnswer: Start by negotiating better trade agreements with our \u2018friendly\u2019 partners.\u201d We have to bring jobs back from places like China, Japan, and Mexico. We have to stand up and be tough. In too many ways we\u2019re giving away the greatest market in the world\u2014the American consumer.\n\nOr on how to replace the Affordable Care Act:\n\nWe should hire the most knowledgable people in the world on this subject and lock them in a room\u2014and not unlock the door until they\u2019ve agreed on the steps we need to take.\n\nThe book also mirrors Trump\u2019s spoken mannerisms. It makes ample use of exclamation points when he finds someone or something absurd, like this exchange with the president of The Club for Growth, David McIntosh, whom the book clearly identifies by his title but for some reason refuses to name:\n\nA week later we received a letter from him reading, \u201cAs we both know, it is business owners who create jobs\u2014not the government. Then he asked for a million dollar donation. A million dollars!\n\nOr when he wants you to know he is outraged:\n\nAmericans want to work. We have a great work ethic in this country. The problem is that when young people look for their first good jobs, or people who have lost their jobs look for new ones, they can\u2019t find any. The jobs aren\u2019t there. They\u2019ve vanished!\n\nOr when he feels he has been underestimated:\n\nI have proven everybody wrong. EVERYBODY!\n\nThe book is incredibly good at making you feel like Trump is speaking directly to you. In fact, Crippled America is one of the only books I\u2019ve ever read, if not the only book I\u2019ve ever read, that I experienced as an audio book. The short, staccato sentences. The over-reliance on banal adjectives (\u201cterrible,\u201d \u201cnice,\u201d \u201cbeautiful\u201d) to describe the world. Waiting \u201con line,\u201d not \u201cin line.\u201d You don\u2019t read it so much as it is read to you, a collection of audio clips that you have heard somewhere already, a sound board whose buttons stick.\n\nWhich is really the thing about Crippled America: you have already read this novelization of the Donald Trump show.\n\nIn every chapter, I found myself struck by the extent to which I had internalized his views and general concerns: Trump wants to build a big, beautiful wall along the Mexican border, but that wall will also have a big, beautiful door to let people in; he will assemble the most muscular, best military in the world so that we will never have to use it; he believes Common Core is bad; he plans to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act with \u201csomething terrific;\u201d Syrian refugees have no place in the United States because they could cause \u201cproblems;\u201d LaGuardia airport is bad; he cherishes women.\n\nI didn\u2019t even have to page back through the book or refer to my notes to confirm these points. I just know them. They are in my bones. Which is exactly how Trump\u2014probably the shrewdest master of stagecraft in this election\u2014wants it.\n\nIn a book full of vague policy pronouncements and sometimes comically bizarre anecdotes (Trump thwarting a wind farm in Scotland in order to preserve the view from one of his golf courses is somehow tied into a chapter on energy and the environment), his awareness of his own power to massage and hold the public\u2019s attention offers one of Crippled America\u2018s most lucid moments:\n\nI use the media the way the media uses me\u2014to attract attention. Once I have that attention, it\u2019s up to me to use it to my advantage. I learned a long time ago that if you\u2019re not afraid to be outspoken, the media will write about you or beg you to come on their shows. If you do things a little differently, if you say outrageous things and fight back, they love you. So sometimes I make outrageous comments and give them what they want\u2014viewers and readers\u2014in order to make a point. [\u2026] I have a mutually profitable two-way relationship with the media\u2014we give each other what we need. And now I am using that relationship to talk about the future of America.\n\nBut after three months of leading the Republican field, recent polls, coinciding with the release of his new book, show Trump dropping to second place. Voters can be fickle like that. The reality television personality turned presidential candidate may not know much about foreign or domestic policy, but he knows enough about the entertainment economy to recognize that his stock is down. And if people aren\u2019t buying, to borrow one of the many business metaphors laced throughout Crippled America, you\u2019re eventually going to go out of business.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://fusion.net/wp-content/themes/fusion-theme/assets/images/favicons/browserconfig.xml?v=1462067892199", "msapplication-TileColor": "#da532c", "description": "Trump's \"Crippled America\" is exactly the book on Trump's candidacy we might have expected, and undoubtedly the book we deserve.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Fusion", "description": "Donald Trump announced his presidential candidacy in the middle of June; the publisher of his new book,\u00a0Threshold Editions, a conservative imprint of\u00a0Simon & Schuster, announced the release date in late September.", "title": "You Have Already Read Donald Trump's Brand New Book", "url": "http://fusion.net/story/226141/donald-trump-new-book-crippled-america/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://i1.wp.com/fusion.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/gettyimages-495466510.jpg?resize=1200%2C630&quality=80&strip=all", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Donald Trump announced his presidential candidacy in the middle of June; the publisher of his new book,\u00a0Threshold Editions, a conservative imprint of\u00a0Simon & Schuster, announced the release date in", "title": "You have already read Donald Trump's brand new book", "url": "http://fusion.net/story/226141/donald-trump-new-book-crippled-america/", "image": "http://i1.wp.com/fusion.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/gettyimages-495466510.jpg?resize=560%2C294&quality=80&strip=all", "site": "@fusion", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Fusion.net", "pocket-site-verification": "81a5587d6c56043280b2554922f43d", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6a5260d31ead375c331934cb6df4833"}, "fb": {"app_id": 796694167041552}, "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://fusion.net/wp-content/themes/fusion-theme/assets/images/favicons/mstile-144x144.png?v=1462067892199", "application-name": "Fusion.net", "msvalidate.01": "0EABD001D404EA9DDE2025E9E4F14CAF", "google-site-verification": "BKw_9qDU04u2w1WoNF53fplAwWXVK_DJ1b6rZDR5u-M", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "donald trump new book, donald trump recent book, donald trump crippled america review, donald trump ben carson polls, what is the name of donald trump's new book, donald trump president speech, donald trump immigration, donald trump mexico wall"}, "article_summary": "It is exactly the book on Trump\u2019s candidacy we might have expected, and undoubtedly the book we deserve.\nCrippled America is a child\u2019s book report on Donald Trump: conversational in tone and remarkably low on detail.\nWhich is really the thing about Crippled America: you have already read this novelization of the Donald Trump show.\nIn fact, Crippled America is one of the only books I\u2019ve ever read, if not the only book I\u2019ve ever read, that I experienced as an audio book.\nAnd if people aren\u2019t buying, to borrow one of the many business metaphors laced throughout Crippled America, you\u2019re eventually going to go out of business."}
