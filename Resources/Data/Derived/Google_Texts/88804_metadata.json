He wanted her European identity card. The marriage was arranged so the 23-year-old Pakistani groom could gain the right to live and work in Europe.\n\nBalogova was promised a clean place to stay in Britain and maybe even some money. But she says within days of arrival, she was moved from Manchester to Glasgow in Scotland, where she was kept in an apartment with her future husband. When he wasn\u2019t around, his younger brother would stand over her, and her identity documents were taken away.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t let me out at any time. He told me it was not possible to go out there,\u201d said Balogova, a shy, petite Gypsy woman who spoke reluctantly, never making any eye contact when she was interviewed. \u201cOnce a week we went out together. I was never allowed to go alone.\u201d\n\nEach year, dozens of women like Balogova from the poorer corners of eastern Europe are lured to the West for sham marriages.\n\nThe men, who authorities say are often Asian or African, pay large sums because they want to live, work or claim benefits more easily in their chosen country and move freely within Europe. The brokers, often organized criminal gangs, take most or all of the profits. And the women sometimes end up trapped in a foreign country with nothing.\n\nThis relatively new form of trafficking comes at a time when Britain continues to tighten its borders, and politicians across western Europe are clamoring for tougher curbs to immigration. Illicit marriages to get around these laws are becoming more common, including direct arrangements between grooms and women as well as the sale of brides.\n\nIn Britain, one of several countries where the brides show up, the number of women suspected of being trafficked for sham marriages in 2013 doubled from the year before to 45, according to the National Crime Agency. And Europol last year identified this type of crime as an \u201cemerging phenomenon.\u201d\n\nMost brides get paid-for trips to Britain, Ireland, Germany and the Netherlands, and some don\u2019t fully realize what they\u2019ve gotten themselves into until they arrive. Women have been held captive until their marriage papers are signed, abused by their \u201chusband\u201d and his friends, used for sex and drug trafficking or even made to marry more than once, according to European authorities and charities.\n\n\u201cDepending on the case, a woman can be sold for thousands of euros,\u201d said Angelika Molnar, an anti-trafficking specialist at Europol. \u201cI can tell you it is lucrative.\u201d\n\nIn Latvia, trafficking for sham marriages is considered so serious that the government is leading a European Commission-funded international program to combat it. Of the 34 trafficking victims lured abroad from the Baltic state recorded last year, 22 were for sham marriages, according to Laisma Stabina, anti-trafficking coordinator at the country\u2019s Interior Ministry.\n\nThe numbers are still tiny compared to the thousands of cases of fake marriages reported each year to Britain\u2019s Home Office, where brides agree to wed for money and are considered accomplices. But officials acknowledge that the trafficking of brides is hard to track.\n\n\u201cI think the problem is much bigger than we realize, because we only see a small percentage of the offenses being committed,\u201d said Phil Brewer, head of Scotland Yard\u2019s trafficking and kidnap unit. \u201cThere is still not a big understanding of the signs.\u201d\n\nTo understand why the women do it, you need only go to Balogova\u2019s village.\n\nBalogova, like most women trafficked from Slovakia, comes from a destitute Roma, or Gypsy, settlement. It lies on Slovakia\u2019s border with Ukraine and Hungary, and is home to about 250 Gypsies, Europe\u2019s poorest minority group. Most of the tin huts have no plumbing, the lanes are muddy, the houses are grimy, and the water from a rusty well is contaminated.\n\nNicholas Ogu, a social worker, says he knows of several others from Balogova\u2019s village who were married in Britain. The trade, as he called it, is controlled by a Gypsy gang that recruits the jobless and poorly educated with offers of good earnings abroad. The women become bogus brides or go into prostitution, while the men typically end up in forced labor.\n\n\u201cThey lure them, sometimes offer them a flight ticket, sometimes they go by bus or car,\u201d said Ogu. \u201cThey arrange the wedding \u2026 when the men got what they need, they get rid of them.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Brides for sale: European women lured for sham marriages", "title": "Brides for sale: European women lured for sham marriages", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Brides for sale: European women lured for sham marriages", "title": "Brides for sale: European women lured for sham marriages", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/26/brides_for_sale_european_women_lured_for_sham_marriages/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/slovakia-eu-trafficked-brides.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Brides for sale: European women lured for sham marriages", "title": "Brides for sale: European women lured for sham marriages", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/slovakia-eu-trafficked-brides.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sylvia Hui and Karel Janicek", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "I was never allowed to go alone.\u201dEach year, dozens of women like Balogova from the poorer corners of eastern Europe are lured to the West for sham marriages.\n\u201cI can tell you it is lucrative.\u201dIn Latvia, trafficking for sham marriages is considered so serious that the government is leading a European Commission-funded international program to combat it.\nOf the 34 trafficking victims lured abroad from the Baltic state recorded last year, 22 were for sham marriages, according to Laisma Stabina, anti-trafficking coordinator at the country\u2019s Interior Ministry.\nIllicit marriages to get around these laws are becoming more common, including direct arrangements between grooms and women as well as the sale of brides.\nThe women become bogus brides or go into prostitution, while the men typically end up in forced labor."}
