Russ Feingold (D-Wis.), who is challenging Johnson for his Senate seat.\n\nThe posting of the article violated U.S. code, as well as Senate Ethics Committe rules on not using the Senate Internet for partisan reasons, the group alleges.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Johnson's office posted an article that took issue with a PolitiFact story that evaluated statements made by Feingold in June.\n\nThe fact-checking website had categorized as \"mostly true\" Feingold's assertion that \"my opponent is opposed to all government-assisted student loans.\"\n\nThe reply on Johnson's website, posted under the \"In the News\" section, fired back, saying that \"the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\u2019s PolitiFact franchise seems to have a hard time being honest about what words mean. It's not surprising then that they've found a kindred spirit in former Sen. Russ Feingold.\"\n\nThe American Democracy Legal Fund, which sent its complaint to Sens. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) and Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), said that \"though ostensibly addressed to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\u2019s franchise, PolitiFact, the article is in fact a partisan political attack and response to Senator Russ Feingold.\"\n\nThe group concludes: \"Senator Johnson\u2019s actions warrant further investigation by this committee. Accordingly, we respectfully request that the Committee undertake a preliminary inquiry immediately.\"\n\nJohnson is one of the most vulnerable Republicans up for reelection next year.\n\nFeingold entered the Senate race in mid-May and raised $2.2 million, during the Federal Election Commission's latest quarter. Johnson raised $2 million during the same quarter.\n\nJohnson\u2019s office didn\u2019t respond to request for comment.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The American Democracy Legal Fund accuses Ron Johnson of violating the Senate's Internet policy.", "description": "The American Democracy Legal Fund accuses Ron Johnson of violating the Senate's Internet policy.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Floor Action"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The American Democracy Legal Fund accuses Ron Johnson of violating the Senate's Internet policy.", "title": "Outside group files complaint against GOP senator", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/250343-outside-group-files-complaint-against-gop-senator", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/johnsonron_020415gn.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-08-05T15:07:01-04:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2015-08-05T15:07-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/250343-outside-group-files-complaint-against-gop-senator", "dcterms.date": "2015-08-05T15:02-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Elliot Smilowitz", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "author": "Jordain Carney", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Ron Johnson, Russ Feingold,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-05T15:02:39-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-05T15:07:01-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/250343-outside-group-files-complaint-against-gop-senator", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The American Democracy Legal Fund accuses Ron Johnson of violating the Senate's Internet policy.", "card": "summary", "title": "Outside group files complaint against GOP senator"}, "dcterms.title": "Outside group files complaint against GOP senator"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbddb\"", "article_summary": "ADVERTISEMENT Johnson's office posted an article that took issue with a PolitiFact story that evaluated statements made by Feingold in June.\nThe group concludes: \"Senator Johnson\u2019s actions warrant further investigation by this committee.\nThe posting of the article violated U.S. code, as well as Senate Ethics Committe rules on not using the Senate Internet for partisan reasons, the group alleges.\nThe reply on Johnson's website, posted under the \"In the News\" section, fired back, saying that \"the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\u2019s PolitiFact franchise seems to have a hard time being honest about what words mean.\nThe group says an article posted on the senator's website \u2014 and subsequently removed \u2014 was a \"partisan political attack\" against former Sen.
