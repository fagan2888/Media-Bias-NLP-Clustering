Global oil prices fell slightly in response.\n\nThe union did not elaborate on why it decided to return to work. It was not immediately clear if there would now be talks with the government on the dispute.\n\nThe strike may presage more discontent in Kuwait this year as the government, running a budget deficit because of low oil prices, seeks to rein in lavish spending on wages, social welfare and food and energy subsidies for its citizens.\n\nThe cabinet has been considering measures since last year, including hikes in prices of gasoline, other fuels and utilities, but has acted more slowly than other Gulf states in implementing such reforms because they could be opposed in parliament.\n\nOil production fell as low as 1.1 million barrels per day (bpd) during the strike, which was not joined by non-Kuwaiti workers in the industry. Previously, Kuwait's output was about 3 million bpd.\n\nOutput recovered to 1.6 million bpd on Wednesday from 1.5 million bpd on Tuesday, a Kuwaiti industry source told Reuters.\n\nSix supertankers lined up at Kuwait's crude export terminal to load oil on Wednesday in anticipation of a return to normal, shipping data on Thomson Reuters Eikon showed.\n\nState refiner Kuwait National Petroleum Co (KNPC) will resume its maximum production capacity in under three days, its spokesman Khaled al-Asousi told Reuters. KNPC is currently refining 530,000 bpd; before the strike, its output was 930,000 bpd.\n\n(Reporting by Ahmed Hagagy; Writing by Andrew Torchia; Editing by Andrew Torchia and Mark Potter)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Thousands of Kuwaiti workers agreed to return to work from Wednesday morning after sta", "title": "Kuwait says may resume normal oil output three days after strike ends", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/20/Kuwait-says-may-resume-normal-oil-output-three-days-after-strike-ends", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/kuwait-oil-strike_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/20/Kuwait-says-may-resume-normal-oil-output-three-days-after-strike-ends", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/kuwait-oil-strike_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Thousands of Kuwaiti workers agreed to return to work from Wednesday morning after sta", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1d75\"", "article_summary": "Output recovered to 1.6 million bpd on Wednesday from 1.5 million bpd on Tuesday, a Kuwaiti industry source told Reuters.\nGlobal oil prices fell slightly in response.\nPreviously, Kuwait's output was about 3 million bpd.\nKNPC is currently refining 530,000 bpd; before the strike, its output was 930,000 bpd.\nState refiner Kuwait National Petroleum Co (KNPC) will resume its maximum production capacity in under three days, its spokesman Khaled al-Asousi told Reuters."}
