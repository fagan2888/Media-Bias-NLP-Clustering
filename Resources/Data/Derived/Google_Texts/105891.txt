A McPherson man wanted for first-degree murder was arrested Friday night in Wichita.

Samuel N. Darrah was wanted for the death of 39-year-old James Croft in November of 2014. Croft's body was found in his car in a ditch near the town of Galva.

U.S. Marshals discovered Darrah was staying at a home in the 800 block of South Lorraine in Wichita. Officers located him hiding inside a false wall in the residence around 11 p.m. and took him into custody.

Darrah, 45, is currently being held in the Sedgwick County jail on a $500,000 bond.

Two others were previously taken into custody in connection to Croft's death: Clinton Bascue and Kamra Kay Farrell. Bascue was sentenced to life in prison after pleading no contest to murder. Farrell was charged with murder in April. Thereâ€™s no word on her next court appearance.
