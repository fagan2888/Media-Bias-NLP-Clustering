That\u2019s a fact.\n\nCongress held hearings \u2014 embarrassing hearings. Three top Internal Revenue Service officials resigned. No heads rolled, but for the Obama administration, and the lawless Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., that amounted to a major scandal. Even White House spokesman Jay \u201cCircus\u201d Carney called the IRS\u2018 actions \u201cinappropriate.\u201d Fact.\n\nSPECIAL COVERAGE: Tea Party Voices\n\nBut President Obama, in an interview last week with sycophant Chris Matthews, now says the entire scandal was made up by the media.\n\n\u201cWhen we do things right, they don\u2019t get a lot of attention,\u201d the president said, no doubt sending a thrill up the MSNBC host\u2019s leg. \u201cIf we do something that is perceived at least initially as a screw-up, it will be on the nightly news for a week.\u201d\n\nLike, say, deploying the nation\u2019s tax watchdog to target political opponents? Just a \u201cscrew-up.\u201d\n\nYou bet. Manufactured in the media.\n\n\u201cIf, on the other hand,\u201d Mr. Obama said, \u201d you\u2019ve got an office in Cincinnati in the IRS office that, I think for bureaucratic reasons, is trying to streamline what is a difficult law to interpret about whether nonprofit is actually a political organization, deserves a tax exempt agency [sic], and they\u2019ve got a list. Suddenly everyone is outraged.\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019ll point out there are some so-called progressives and, you know, perceived to be liberal commentators who during that week just were outraged at the possibility that these folks, you know, had been at the direction of the Democratic Party, in some way discriminated against tea party folks. You know, that is what gets news. That\u2019s what gets attention.\u201d\n\nUh, yeah. That\u2019s what \u201cgets news.\u201d In fact, that\u2019s also what gets presidents impeached (see Nixon, Richard re: Watergate).\n\nLike Benghazi, when Obama officials like Susan E. Rice, Hillary Rodham Clinton \u2014 even the president himself \u2014 tried to make up a narrative that the attack on a U.S. diplomatic compound was spontaneous and only about some obscure YouTube video, the story that America\u2019s top officials tried to ply on the IRS scandal was that a few rogue workers had committed some transgressions. No scandal here, they said.\n\nOf course, that was the red flag. No one knew? (Of course, that is the mantra of the Obama administration \u2014 no one ever knows anything. They had three years to build the Obamacare website, and when it didn\u2019t work, well \u2026 No one knew! Sheesh, get off our backs!)\n\nAlthough the president is busy trying to change the subject, this time to income inequality, the IRS story just won\u2019t disappear. Last week, Rep. Darrell E. Issa, chairman of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, had simply had enough. He called out the IRS\u2018 chief counsel, William Wilkins, for saying \u201cI don\u2019t recall\u201d a staggering 80 times during his congressional testimony last month.\n\n\u201cYour memory consistently failed when you were asked about information you shared with the Treasury Department,\u201d the lawmaker wrote. \u201cYour failure to recollect important aspects of the Committee\u2019s investigation suggests either a deliberate attempt to obfuscate your involvement in this matter or gross incompetence on your part.\u201d\n\nFunny, the Obama administration, in Year 5, is totally fine with \u201cgross incompetence.\u201d Many warned that these guys weren\u2019t ready for prime time. They said they were.\n\nBut really, they weren\u2019t. And like with Obamacare, all they can say is it\u2019s not our fault. Worse, no one seems to know anything. But as everyone knows, ignorance is no excuse.\n\n\u2022 Joseph Curl covered the White House and politics for a decade for The Washington Times and is now editor of the Drudge Report.
