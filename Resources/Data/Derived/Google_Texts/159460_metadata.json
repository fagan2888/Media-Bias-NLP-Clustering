But due to rising expenses, including the cost of opening the Children\u2019s Hospital, anticipated operating income in next budget year is expected to drop to $52.5 million, or 3.5 percent.\n\nThat projection comes even as total net operating revenue is expected to grow to $1.5 billion \u2014 up from $1.3 billion in 2015 and $1.4 billion in 2016. Those increases, according to UIHC administrators, largely are tied to massive volume growth \u2014 admissions to the UI Hospitals and Clinics have gone up 3,898 over the past six years, and patients discharged have surged 33,894 during the same period.\n\nThe hospital\u2019s total weekday average daily census is up nearly 100 patients from two years ago \u2014 it sits at 654 to date this year.\n\nIts peak daily census since January occurred in March, when the hospital reported 698 inpatients, documents show. The university boasts 728 staffed beds, meaning a 698 census represents 96 percent occupancy.\n\n\u201cThat is almost gridlock,\u201d said Ken Kates, associate vice president and chief executive officer for UIHC. \u201cWe are staffing every possible bed we can open in Iowa City.\u201d\n\nThe hospital is implementing several initiatives to deal with the high census, including increasing staff, adding specialists and moving toward growing capacity. Administrators are converting one floor of the Helen K. Rossi Volunteer Guest House \u2014 which provides lodging and services to families of patients \u2014 into 13 new observation beds.\n\nAnd it\u2019s renting 14 rooms at a nearby hotel for those families who would have stayed at the Rossi House. As a result of the new Children\u2019s Hospital opening, 61 more private beds in the main hospital will be converted by summer 2018.\n\nWith other potential opportunities to add beds, the hospital\u2019s capacity could grow to 856 beds by the 2019 budget year, according to Kates.\n\nWhen asked to explain the growth, UIHC administrators credited changes enacted through the Affordable Care Act, more coordination and referrals with providers and an improved economy.\n\n\u201cWhen the economy is better, people use health care,\u201d said Jean Robillard, vice president for medical affairs with UI Health Care.\n\nAt the same time revenue continues to grow, expenses also are increasing \u2014 with total operating expenses swelling from $1.15 billion in 2015 to $1.24 billion in the current year to a projected $1.37 billion in the next year.", "article_metadata": {"Description": "The Gazette | COUNCIL BLUFFS - University of Iowa Health Care patient rates will increase 6 percent in the next budget year, which administrators for the $1.9 billion enterpr", "og": {"site_name": "The Gazette", "description": "COUNCIL BLUFFS - University of Iowa Health Care patient rates will increase 6 percent in the next budget year, which administrators for the $1.9 billion enterprise said will help them keep pace with the rising cost of doing business and the opening of the new UI Children's Hospital later this year.", "url": "http://www.thegazette.com/subject/news/education/higher-education/university-of-iowa-health-care-rates-to-climb-6-percent-20160421", "image": "http://www.thegazette.com/storyimage/GA/20160421/ARTICLE/160429925/AR/0/AR-160429925.jpg", "article": {"section": "Default"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thegazette.com/subject/news/education/higher-education/university-of-iowa-health-care-rates-to-climb-6-percent-20160421", "description": "COUNCIL BLUFFS - University of Iowa Health Care patient rates will increase 6 percent in the next budget year, which administrators for the $1.9 billion enterprise said will help them keep pace with the rising cost of doing business and the opening of the new UI Children's Hospital later this year.", "site": "@gazettedotcom", "title": "University of Iowa Health Care rates to climb 6 percent"}, "fb": {"app_id": 163646090334606}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "bt": {"modDate": "2016-04-21T20:44:00-05:00", "type": "thegazette_default", "pubDate": "2016-04-21T16:16:31-05:00", "title": "University of Iowa Health Care rates to climb 6 percent"}, "MobileOptimized": 320, "apple-touch-fullscreen": "yes", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWhen the economy is better, people use health care,\u201d said Jean Robillard, vice president for medical affairs with UI Health Care.\nWhen asked to explain the growth, UIHC administrators credited changes enacted through the Affordable Care Act, more coordination and referrals with providers and an improved economy.\nAs a result of the new Children\u2019s Hospital opening, 61 more private beds in the main hospital will be converted by summer 2018.\nCOUNCIL BLUFFS \u2014 University of Iowa Health Care patient rates will increase 6 percent in the next budget year, which administrators for the $1.9 billion enterprise said will help them keep pace with the rising cost of doing business and the opening of the new UI Children\u2019s Hospital later this year.\nBut due to rising expenses, including the cost of opening the Children\u2019s Hospital, anticipated operating income in next budget year is expected to drop to $52.5 million, or 3.5 percent."}
