In what announcers said was the fastest finish in tour history, cyclist Juan Magallanes, 33, crossed the finish line of the 2015 El Tour de Tucson in 3:54:59.72, while Ramon Juarez, 31, crossed at almost the same instant in 3:54:59.90.

Hot on their heels, so to speak, was the tandem bike team of Chris DeMarchi and Phil Tintsman, ages 44 and 41 respectively, who crossed the finish at 3:55:00.56 and 3:55:00.63. The tandem led for much of the race.

The announcers said this is the fastest finish in tour history, and it was a photo finish at that.
