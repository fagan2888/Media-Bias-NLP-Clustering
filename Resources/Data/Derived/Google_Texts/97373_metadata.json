But it should also be remembered as the year another established order was forever altered by change, dissent and revelations of its corruption.\n\nFor years, an out-of-touch establishment has dominated education policy too. A well-funded elite has labeled public education as generally a failed enterprise and insisted that only a regime of standardized testing and charter schools can make schools and educators more \u201caccountable.\u201d Politicians and pundits across the political spectrum have adopted this narrative of \u201creform\u201d and now easily slip into the rhetoric that supports it without hesitation.\n\nBut in 2013 a grassroots rebellion growing out of inner city neighborhoods from Newark to Chicago and suburban boroughs from Long Island to Denver began to counter the education aristocracy and tell an alternative tale about schools.\n\nThe education counter-narrative is that public schools are not as much the perpetrators of failure as they are victims of resource deprivation, inequity in the system and undermining forces driven by corruption and greed. In other words, it wasn\u2019t schools that needed to be made more accountable; it was the failed leadership of those in the business and government establishment that needed more accountability.\n\nThe uprising has been steadily growing into an Education Spring unifying diverse factions across the nation in efforts to reverse education policy mandates and bolster public schools instead of punishing them and closing them down.\n\n2015 became the year the uprising reached a level where it forever transformed the hegemonic control the reformers have had on education policy.\n\nMost prominently, No Child Left Behind, the federal law that\u2019s been driving education policy since 2001, was replaced with a new law, the Every Student Succeeds Act, that reverses many of the edicts of NCLB or leaves them up in the air for states and courts to decide.\n\nAlso, comments made by establishment presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will reverberate through the election in 2016. Specifically, at a town hall held in South Carolina, broadcast by C-SPAN, Clinton responded to a question about charter schools by saying, \u201cMost charter schools, I don\u2019t want to say every one, but most charter schools, they don\u2019t take the hardest-to-teach kids. Or if they do, they don\u2019t keep them.\u201d A week or so later, Clinton transgressed the status quo again by remarking, in a conversation with members of the American Federation of Teachers, \u201cI have for a very long time also been against the idea that you tie teacher evaluation and even teacher pay to test outcomes. There\u2019s no evidence. There\u2019s no evidence.\u201d\n\nOrganizations and individuals connected to wealthy donors to the Democratic Party were appalled, but the truth is out, and skepticism about education policy prescriptions touted as necessary \u201creforms\u201d to the system has now left the fringe and become mainstream.\n\nThe bigger, more important story emerging from 2015 is that the American public is increasingly at odds with a reform movement that seeks to remake schools into an image promoted by wealthy private foundations, influential think tanks and well-financed political operations such as the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC).\n\nThe evidence against the education establishment\u2019s case piled up as the year rolled on, and the narrative of public education policy will never be the same.\n\nBlows to the Testocracy\n\nTake the issue of standardized testing. The idea that school improvement should be about enforcing uniform measures of test score outcomes across the nation had a particularly bad year in 2015.\n\nAs Seattle classroom teacher and public school activist Jesse Hagopian explains in an article for the National Education Association, standardized tests became the focal point of widespread scorn and dissent.\n\nMore than 620,000 public school students around the U.S. refused to take standardized exams. Also, numerous states ended high school graduation tests, and dozens of universities and colleges reduced or eliminated test requirements for their admissions process.\n\nThe backlash to standardized testing prompted changes in federal policy as well, including the revision of NCLB. As Hagopian writes, \u201cESSA deposes one of the cruelest aspects of the test-and-punish policy under NCLB: the so-called \u2018Adequate Yearly Progress\u2019 annual test score improvement requirement that labeled nearly every American school failing.\u201d\n\nAlso, as Hagopian notes, President Obama, acknowledging the growing resistance to testing, \u201cannounced in October that \u2018unnecessary testing\u2019 is \u2018consuming too much instructional time.\u2019 This announcement came as a surprise given Obama\u2019s support for policies like Race to the Top that contributed to the proliferation of high-stakes testing. The reversal of rhetoric was a result of the mass opt-out movement and will surely embolden authentic-assessment activists in the coming year.\u201d\n\n\u201cPressure from parents, students, teachers, school officials, and community leaders began turning the tide against standardized exam overuse and misuse during the 2014-2015 school year,\u201d declares a report from the National Center for Fair and Open Testing (FairTest.org).\n\nFairTest\u2019s report highlights \u201cassessment reform victories\u201d in numerous states where officials suspended or significantly revised testing policies and created \u201calternative systems of assessment and accountability\u201d that \u201cdeemphasize standardized tests.\u201d\n\nThink Progress, the action center of the left-leaning Beltway think tank the Center for American Progress, also reports on the overturn of the testocracy in its review: \u201cthese education protests got results in 2015.\u201d\n\nNoting the growing opt-out movement in Colorado, New Jersey, Indiana, Michigan, South Carolina, Pennsylvania, Oregon and Wisconsin, the Think Progress writer highlights New York in particular, \u201cwhere 20 percent of students opted out of tests in 2015. The number of New York students opting out quadrupled from [2014].\u201d\n\nReform Is Losing the Left\n\nNew York in particular provides an example of how education reform may fare in the near future, at least in left-leaning states where leaders have been persuaded by big-money donors to crack down on public schools and educators.\n\nLed by Governor Andrew Cuomo and his former state education chief, now currently acting U.S. Secretary of Education, John King, the Empire State had been a model for reform ideology, being among the first to implement the Common Core and its associated tests and pursuing a harsh new model for evaluating teachers, in which 50 percent of teachers\u2019 performance rating was tied to students\u2019 test scores.\n\nBut recently Cuomo made \u201ca complete about face\u201d on education, observes a recent op-ed in a New York press outlet. The writer \u2013 Billy Easton, executive director of the Alliance for Quality Education, a progressive New York state organization \u2013 notes that Cuomo had made his test-based teacher evaluation system the \u201ctop legislative priority in 2015\u2033 and had claimed it was \u201done of the greatest legacies for me and the state.\u201d\n\nBut the evaluation system had angered teachers and parents and helped spur the test boycotts noted above. Seeing his public approval numbers plummeting, Cuomo engineered, according to Easton, a redo on the evaluation system that prompted the state education authority to place a moratorium on test-based teacher evaluations.\n\nEaston believes Cuomo\u2019s actions in New York are likely too little, too late \u2013 arguing that he has been \u201cthe author of his own demise on education issues.\u201d That may be, but far more likely, other Democratic Party governors are bound to notice how reform policies like those carried out in New York have now lost the left and are rapidly growing out of favor with the public at large.\n\nOf course, in states and districts where test-based teacher evaluations are already established in the policy landscape, teachers will likely feel the effects of these systems for some time. So the fight over teacher evaluations will go state by state in the years ahead.\n\nBut as new reports continue to call these flawed and unfair evaluations into question, there will be more examples of these systems being overturned.\n\nReform Fads Don\u2019t Work\n\nUsing test scores to evaluate teachers \u2013 one of the pillars of the reform movement \u2013 is not the only policy idea going out of favor. Using the scores to evaluate the viability of local schools is running into more opposition as well\n\nIn Tennessee, also an early adopter of reform fads, leaders had put into place a system that used student scores on standardized tests to pronounce schools as \u201cfailing\u201d and provide the rationale for the state to take over management of the schools by an appointed board. What follows these takeovers, invariably, is that the agency, whose officials are handpicked by conservative lawmakers, transfers the schools to privately operated charter management organizations.\n\nIn Tennessee, the state takeover agency is called the Achievement School District, but the model is being adopted under other guises by many other states.\n\nNow Tennessee\u2019s much-lauded takeover program has run into \u201cpolitical trouble\u201d according to a recent article in Education Week.\n\n\u201cSeveral Democratic state lawmakers,\u201d according to the article, \u201cwill propose bills this upcoming legislative session to either shut down the turnaround district, which mostly is based in Memphis, or severely limit its authority to take over schools.\u201d\n\nThe legislature\u2019s Black Caucus, the representatives of the communities most often targeted by the takeovers, are helping to lead the pushback.\n\nIn Memphis, where the ASD has charterized more than two dozen schools, parents are leading the fight as well. As Chalkbeat Tennessee reports, members of the district\u2019s neighborhood advisory councils have called the takeover process a \u201cscam\u201d and claimed the method for taking over their neighborhood schools \u201cwas rigged in favor of pairing struggling schools with charter operators.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "After years of attacks on teachers and public education, Americans are catching up to the real story in our schools", "author": "Jeff Bryant", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "After years of attacks on teachers and public education, Americans are catching up to the real story in our schools", "title": "We\u2019re onto the phony education reformers: Charter school charlatans and faux reformers take it on the chin", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/01/09/were_onto_the_phony_education_reformers_charter_school_charlatans_and_faux_reformers_take_it_on_the_chin/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/01/gates_rhee_duncan.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "After years of attacks on teachers and public education, Americans are catching up to the real story in our schools", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/01/gates_rhee_duncan.jpg", "title": "We\u2019re onto the phony education reformers: Charter school charlatans and faux reformers take it on the chin", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "We\u2019re onto the phony education reformers: Charter school charlatans and faux reformers take it on the chin", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Charter schools, Education, public schools", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The evidence against the education establishment\u2019s case piled up as the year rolled on, and the narrative of public education policy will never be the same.\n2015 became the year the uprising reached a level where it forever transformed the hegemonic control the reformers have had on education policy.\nTopics: Charter schools, Education, public schools2015 will forever be remembered as the year the political establishment was shaken by the populist-driven presidential candidacies of Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders.\nFor years, an out-of-touch establishment has dominated education policy too.\nThe uprising has been steadily growing into an Education Spring unifying diverse factions across the nation in efforts to reverse education policy mandates and bolster public schools instead of punishing them and closing them down."}
