That we are living in a \u201cnew Gilded Age\u201d is a commonplace that is rapidly becoming a clich\u00e9. The former senator and secretary of state\u2019s words affected me because they reminded me of the days when talking about a \u201cNew Gilded Age\u201d was the opposite of trite; when it was an affront to what every responsible person knew to be true. Specifically, I thought of the mid-1990s, when my colleagues and I at The Baffler magazine used the phrase to describe the era presided over by Hillary Clinton\u2019s husband Bill. We inscribed the expression in the subtitle of our 1997 anthology, \u201cCommodify Your Dissent: The Business of Culture in the New Gilded Age.\u201d\n\nI did not invent the term, of course. \u201cThe Gilded Age\u201d was the title of an 1873 Mark Twain novel about political corruption; from there it became a label for the crude form of capitalism that prevailed from the 1870s to about 1900. The phrase \u201cNew Gilded Age,\u201d meanwhile, began showing up in print occasionally in the 1980s to describe the wealth-worship of the Reagan years; I myself picked it up from Kevin Phillips, who wrote in \u201cThe Politics of Rich and Poor\u201d that \u201cThe 1980s were a second Gilded Age.\u201d\n\nSince 1997, however, the expression has gone from obscure to ubiquitous. In 2000, it was used as the title of a New Yorker anthology; in 2002 Paul Krugman employed it in memorable fashion in a New York Times Magazine story, and then went on to make it one of his recurring catchphrases. In recent years it has been used to describe everything from the supercharged prosperity of Washington, D.C., to the complicated relationship between plutocrats around the world. But above all the phrase \u201cnew Gilded Age\u201d denotes inequality on the grand scale\u2014the lush, Vanderbiltian lives of the One Percent and the increasingly desperate lot of everyone else.\n\nOne of the reasons the phrase appealed to me, 17 years ago, was my belief back then that there was something essentially brutal about raw capitalism; if the nation was to suppress the regulations and the workers\u2019 organizations that had tamed the beast over the years\u2014even if we did so with the best of intentions\u2014the economy would return quite naturally to its savage, Gilded Age habits. Mainstream opinion of the 1990s held the exact opposite, however: That those regulations and those workers\u2019 organizations were no longer needed because we had entered a \u201cNew Economy\u201d in which the old rules no longer applied. Perfect information was building perfect markets wherever you turned. The Dow and the NASDAQ were mounting toward unbelievable highs, and our leaders assured us that it was all because history had turned a corner and the common people had been financially enlightened in some miraculous way.\n\nHas there ever been an episode of economic mania so delusional and, ultimately, so destructive? In those days, CEO salaries were smashing every precedent in living memory and yet here were our thought leaders, telling us that what was really happening was a consummation of the nation\u2019s democratic promise. For me, meanwhile, Mark Twain\u2019s phrase seemed exact, almost clinical: What everyone thought to be a golden age was in fact merely gilded.\n\nIt is gratifying after all these years to find that Hillary Clinton likes the phrase too, but her confirmation is a little hard to take when I recall how the \u201990s actually felt. As I looked around back then, it seemed like the 19th century was bursting out all over. Thanks to a ferocious Illinois labor dispute that caught my attention in those days, I understood that unions were barely able to protect their members, let alone the middle class. Thanks to a number of fundraising scandals\u2014admittedly, minor scandals by the standards of today\u2014the nation was learning what politicians would do for lobbyists and donors. The point that really nailed the Gilded Age comparison, however, was the obvious return of monopoly in industry after industry. The concentration of media ownership, a development facilitated by Clinton\u2019s 1996 telecom deregulation, was particularly scary: The Nation magazine ran a big chart showing who owned whom in the \u201cNational Entertainment State\u201d; I myself called it the \u201cCulture Trust.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The gilded age Clinton now laments had its roots in the dark side of Bill's economic record.
