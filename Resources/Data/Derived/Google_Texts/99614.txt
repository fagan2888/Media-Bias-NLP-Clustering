Donald Trump’s doctor claims the presidential candidate ‘has no history of ever using alcohol or tobacco products’.

Doctor Harold Bornstein then goes on to suggest that, if successful in his bid for the White House, Trump ‘will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency’.

The medic has been caring for the 69-year-old billionaire since 1980 and credits his ‘astonishingly excellent’ blood pressure and all round tip top health to his lack of tobacco and alcohol consumption.

But, what’s this? There’s something strange afoot because hordes of Twitter users have managed to find images of Donald Trump holding champagne flutes containing bubbly light gold looking liquid.

Others just used the opportunity to relentlessly mock Trump:
