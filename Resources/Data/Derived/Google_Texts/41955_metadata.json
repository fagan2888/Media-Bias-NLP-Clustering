Bill Haslam\u2019s administration is that Tennessee is open for business.\n\nThat attitude has led to unprecedented growth, especially in the Nashville area, leading to a boom in jobs, record-setting tourism numbers and population growth because people want to live, work and play in Middle Tennessee.\n\nNashville has appeared on numerous national publications\u2019 lists for quality of life, jobs, recreation and food, fashion and music culture.\n\nTourists and investors from London to Tokyo to Ottawa have sought to strengthen ties with the Volunteer State.\n\nHowever, that progress is in peril if Tennessee lawmakers decide that they want to join a handful of other states seeking to humiliate and marginalize its minorities, be it because of religion, sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\nThat could send the message that Tennessee is not serious about being open for business. In turn, that will have serious effects on the growing economy.\n\nButch Spyridon, CEO of the Convention & Visitors Corp., said it plainly: \u201cWhen the state starts introducing legislation that affects our ability to do business, it is not helpful and needs to be rethought. Our success in the hospitality industry is predicated on a welcoming and friendly environment. We don\u2019t need to do anything to diminish or hinder the success that is driving the state\u2019s economy.\u201d\n\nThat includes legislation in the Tennessee General Assembly seeking to require students in public schools and colleges to use bathrooms that correspond to the sex listed on their birth certificate. It is a slap in the face to transgender individuals, blatant ignorance of intersex individuals, and a burden on educators who would be effectively forced to verify the genitalia of their students before letting them use the facilities.\n\nNorth Carolina is already seeing the backlash for its bathroom bill. PayPal has canceled its plan for a global operations center in Charlotte.\n\nAs quoted in the Wall Street Journal, CEO Dan Schulman said: \u201cThe new law perpetuates discrimination, and it violates the values and principles that are at the core of PayPal\u2019s mission and culture. As a result, PayPal will not move forward with our planned expansion into Charlotte.\u201d\n\nImagine if a CEO said the same thing about Tennessee. Imagine if that led to producers of the popular TV show \u201cNashville\u201d filming elsewhere even as the state is looking to invest $8 million to keep the show in the city for a fifth season. That show has helped tell the city\u2019s story across the globe.\n\nThis will not be a proud moment in Tennessee history if we, through our lawmakers, choose to embrace a legacy of discrimination, not just because of the business the state will lose, but because it is the inhumane thing to do.\n\nRecall the backlash that faced Indiana in 2015 over its Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which forced lawmakers and the governor to revise it and water down its effect of allowing business owners to discriminate against others based on religious beliefs.\n\nLegislators have already effectively endorsed Christianity as the religion of the state by passing the Bible bill last week, which Haslam will hopefully veto.\n\nHe also will hopefully veto any legislation that seeks to discriminate against the citizens he is charged to protect.\n\nIf Tennessee is truly open for business, it would be open for business to all people, not just those deemed worthy by the majority of legislators.\n\nOpinion Engagement Editor David Plazas wrote this editorial on behalf of The Tennessean Editorial Board. Call him at 615-259-8063, email him at dplazas@tennessean.com or tweet to him at @davidplazas.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nA Feb. 21 editorial titled \u201cFear, loathing drive anti-gay bills in Tennessee\u201d called out six of those discriminatory bills. Here is the latest on three bills that are still actively being debated.\n\nBathroom restriction bill: House Bill 2414/Senate Bill 2387\n\nSponsors: Sen. Mike Bell, R-Riceville, and Rep. Susan Lynn, R-Mt. Juliet\n\nPurpose: This bill would restrict bathroom use in public schools and colleges based on the sex listed on one\u2019s birth certificate. The state faces a $1 billion federal penalty for Title IX gender discrimination violation.\n\nStatus: This had been set aside to summer study but was revised by a House committee. It will next be considered by the Senate Finance, Ways and Means Committee on Tuesday.\n\nCounselor protection bill: House Bill 1840/Senate Bill 1556\n\nSponsors: Sen. Jack Johnson, R-Franklin, and Rep. Dan Howell, R-Georgetown\n\nPurpose: This bill would allow therapists and counselors to turn away clients who express \u201cgoals, outcomes, or behaviors that conflict with sincerely held religious beliefs,\u201d in violation of the American Counseling Association\u2019s code of ethics. They would be required to refer potential clients to other professionals.\n\nStatus: Passed in the Senate on Feb. 17. Passed in the House on Wednesday.\n\nLynn also sponsored House Joint Resolution 0529, expressing the sense of the General Assembly that it opposes the Supreme Court\u2019s Obergefell v. Hodges same-sex marriage ruling in 2015.\n\nStatus: Passed by the House on March 3. The Senate Judiciary Committee approved it on March 29 and recommended a Senate vote.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://tnne.ws/1S3CjS9", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Lawmakers have approved or are considering bills that foster discrimination, could hurt the economy.", "og": {"site_name": "The Tennessean", "description": "Lawmakers have approved or are considering bills that foster discrimination, could hurt the economy.", "title": "Is Tennessee still open for business?", "url": "http://www.tennessean.com/story/opinion/editorials/2016/04/10/tennessee-still-open-business/82742518/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/tennessean.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Lawmakers have approved or are considering bills that foster discrimination, could hurt the economy.", "title": "Is Tennessee still open for business?", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/cda7bbcdf9e0ad01e8c3f3b072a26e274272e95c/c=271-0-1330-1059&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/04/07/Nashville/Nashville/635956243419741177-Closed-for-Business.jpg", "creator": "@tennessean", "site": "@tennessean", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600028886", "fb": {"app_id": 121487414583460}, "viewport": "width=1070", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/davidplazas"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Subjects/Discrimination", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Subjects/Discrimination", "title": "Is Tennessee still open for business?", "author": "David Plazas", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion/editorials", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4aa2e242a0be71eee59526c73f953390bb7dbfbe/c=403-0-1197-1059/local/-/media/2016/04/07/Nashville/Nashville/635956243419741177-Closed-for-Business.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2aa5df3f089858edcd020a7bf891a9c4ea18a896/c=271-0-1330-1059/local/-/media/2016/04/07/Nashville/Nashville/635956243419741177-Closed-for-Business.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1d1af59e4871e3c8a1b28ad088e71c13d42fa136/c=96-0-1504-1059/local/-/media/2016/04/07/Nashville/Nashville/635956243419741177-Closed-for-Business.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5b414b0818e9a69a6f40ea04efea5ffde55c9abf/c=0-78-1600-982&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2016/04/07/Nashville/Nashville/635956243419741177-Closed-for-Business.jpg", "publishtime": "2016-04-10T07:01:22.483000-05:00", "shorthed": "Is Tennessee still open for business?", "articleid": 82742518, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2835cc412d9365e6e6bc3fa56efa59760a7712a1/c=0-78-1600-982/local/-/media/2016/04/07/Nashville/Nashville/635956243419741177-Closed-for-Business.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3ff21643ec16fb5467b6cb9f37640afbef63b402/c=503-0-1096-1059/local/-/media/2016/04/07/Nashville/Nashville/635956243419741177-Closed-for-Business.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "LGBT, transgender, bathroom bill, PayPal, Tennessee news"}, "article_summary": "If Tennessee is truly open for business, it would be open for business to all people, not just those deemed worthy by the majority of legislators.\nBathroom restriction bill: House Bill 2414/Senate Bill 2387Sponsors: Sen.
