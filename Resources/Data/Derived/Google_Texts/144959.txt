‘Tis the season for basketball’s rumor mill as high schools are wrapping up and colleges are headed into the postseason.

A large one gaining steam is that Rodney Billups, the former George Washington High star who also played at the University of Denver, will be announced as the Pioneers’ new coach on Monday. It would be a switch from assisting Tad Boyle at the University of Colorado.

Another is that Rudy Carey, the longtime Denver figure in boys basketball, was perhaps going to bid on the vacancy heading Cherry Creek’s boys in Greenwood Village. However, Carey said on Saturday there’s nothing to it and he’s happy to remain at Denver East.

Carey, second in state annals in career victories, did allow that he’d like to see his son, David, get consideration for a college spot.

“He’s qualified,” Carey said. “He has coached the past three Mr. Colorado Basketball choices and he has a mind for the game. He knows how to handle himself.”

The younger Carey, who played for his father at Manual and Denver East in the first part of the 1990s, has served as an assistant coach with the Angels and he headed the former Montbello. As an assistant with Denver East, he helped to tutor Dominique Collier, now at CU and a two-time Mr. Colorado Basketball (by The Denver Post) and the past season’s winner, family relative Brian Carey, now at Texas Southern.

“David would be an asset to a college program both as an assistant and a recruiter, and he knows how to handle kids,” Rudy Carey said. “He’s not afraid to give them discipline and they need it.”
