Grim successfully avoided a Cesarean section. . (Heidi de Marco/Kaiser Health News) ( Heidi de Marco/Kaiser Health News )\n\nNEWPORT BEACH, Calif.\u2014 Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian, one of the largest and most respected facilities in Orange County, needed to move quickly.\n\nA big insurer had warned that its maternity costs were too high and it might be cut from the plan\u2019s network. The reason? Too many cesarean sections.\n\n\u201cWe were under intense scrutiny,\u201d said Dr. Allyson Brooks, executive medical director of Hoag\u2019s women\u2019s health institute.\n\nThe C-section rate at the time, in early 2012, was about 38 percent. That was higher than the state average of 33 percent and above most others in the area, according to the California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative, which seeks to use data to improve birth outcomes.\n\nWithin three years, Hoag had lowered its cesarean section rates for all women to just over a third of all births. For low-risk births (first-time moms with single, normal pregnancies), the rate dropped to about a quarter of births. Hoag also increased the percentage of women who had vaginal births after delivering previous children by C-section.\n\nIn medicine, this qualifies as a quick turnaround. And the story of how Hoag changed sheds light on what it takes to rapidly improve a hospital\u2019s performance of crucial services, to the benefit of patients, insurers and taxpayers.\n\nDecreasing C-sections results in \u201cbetter health to mothers and better health to babies and lower costs,\u201d said Stephanie Teleki, senior program officer at the California HealthCare Foundation, which helped fund the data collection and analysis by the California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative. \u201cThat\u2019s like a nirvana moment in health care.\u201d\n\nExperts have long been troubled by the wide variation of C-sections among hospitals nationally. (In California, the rates range from 18 percent to 56 percent.) Certainly there are instances in which C-sections are typically recommended \u2013 such as a baby in breech position. But the disparities suggest that decisions are being driven by factors other than medical necessity \u2013 such as doctors\u2019 time constraints and malpractice concerns.\n\nOver the past few years, there has been a coordinated push to cut C-section rates in other states and in births covered by Medicaid, the health coverage program for low-income Americans.\n\nAcross California, data publicly released by the California HealthCare Foundation, the Pacific Business Group on Health and others in the past few years have underscored the differences in how hospitals handle maternity care.\n\nDespite the increased transparency, however, many hospitals don\u2019t act until dollars are at stake, said Dr. Elliott Main, medical director of the California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative. That\u2019s what happened with Hoag, which Main said is now becoming a model for others.\n\n\u201cIn quality improvement, we call it \u2018the burning bridge,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t just stay still. You\u2019ve got to move.\u201d\n\nFocus on Physicians\n\nAt Hoag, where more than 6,000 babies are born each year, Brooks and other administrators knew that they had to focus on changing the mindset and behavior of physicians. \u201cHospitals don\u2019t do C-sections, doctors do,\u201d she said.\n\nSo they took some aggressive steps. First, they shared the data with all the physicians in the department without names \u2014 then decided to reveal the names. Suddenly, everyone knew who had exceeded or come in under the average.\n\n\u201cThere was a lot of upheaval,\u201d Dr. Jeffrey Illeck, a community OB-GYN and the hospital\u2019s obstetrics department chair. \u201cNone of us want to look bad in front of our peers. \u2026 And some looked horrible.\u201d\n\nSome physicians reacted with surprise and frustration. Initially, many attributed the high rates to the patients, saying they were older, had more complicated pregnancies or demanded scheduled C-sections.\n\nDr. Amy VanBlaricom, an OB-GYN who delivers about 25 to 30 babies a month, said she wasn\u2019t opposed to sharing the data. But she said doctors were worried that the rates would be used to penalize them rather than to drive improvement.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very heated,\u201d she said. \u201cWe should use this data as an opportunity rather than a polarizing topic.\u201d\n\nVanBlaricom already tracked her own rates, which she said fell in the middle of the pack, and has only seen a small drop since. But she said being aware that Hoag is monitoring the C-sections has changed how she thinks about her practice and has encouraged her to let women remain in labor longer.\n\nThat\u2019s what Hoag administrators were aiming for \u2013 a realization among doctors that C-sections should not be undertaken lightly. They carry surgical risks, including serious infection and blood clots, and require longer hospital stays.\n\n\u201cDoctors and patients look at cesareans as an easy way to time the birth,\u201d said Dr. Marlin Mills, chief of perinatology at the hospital. \u201cBut a C-section is not benign. It\u2019s a big surgery.\u201d\n\nThe costs are also well-documented. Surgical births cost nearly $19,000, compared to about $11,500 for vaginal births, according to the Pacific Business Group on Health, (PBGH) an organization of employers that is also working to bring down C-section rates around the state.\n\nPBGH worked with the hospital on the financial side. It enlisted the help of some of the biggest local employers, including Disney, and another insurer, Blue Shield, to adjust payments so the hospital didn\u2019t earn more from elective C-sections than vaginal births.\n\nHoag took other steps, too:\n\nNew scheduling rules: In the past, doctors could simply call in with the woman\u2019s due date and schedule the birth. Now, they have to fill out a detailed form, with some requests needing special approval.\n\nIn the past, doctors could simply call in with the woman\u2019s due date and schedule the birth.

Expanded its use of \u201claborists\u201d: A new obstetrics emergency room is staffed around the clock with doctors specifically assigned to monitor women in labor, deliver babies and respond to emergencies.\n\nDr. Alex Deyan, who delivered more than 500 babies at the hospital last year, used to turn away patients who wanted vaginal births after cesarean sections. With a busy private practice, Deyan said he couldn\u2019t always be immediately available if labor didn\u2019t go as expected and a woman needed a C-section. That changed with the laborist program.\n\n\u201cHaving in-house doctors 24/7 is a huge benefit,\u201d Deyan said. \u201cI can be a little more patient.\u201d\n\nGood for Patients Too\n\nHolly Grim appreciated Hoag\u2019s approach. She knew she didn\u2019t want a C-section with her second baby. Her first labor at another hospital in December 2013 was long and painful and ended with a cesarean section that kept her in the hospital for days. Her son was healthy, but she said, \u201cthis wasn\u2019t exactly how I had it planned \u2013 not even close.\u201d\n\nThis time, she needed to get back on her feet quickly so she could chase after her 16-month-old. She decided to switch to a doctor at Hoag. And in early April, she got her wish \u2014 giving birth naturally to an 8-pound girl, Agnes.\n\nThe day after Agnes was born, the family was packing up to go home. She didn\u2019t have any restrictions on lifting or driving, and she wasn\u2019t in severe pain. This, she said, is how childbirth is supposed to be.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m feeling really good,\u201d she said as she nursed Agnes, wrapped in a blanket decorated with pastel footprints. \u201cI\u2019m relieved I\u2019ll be able to run around after my son.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The hospital's tools included sharing each doctor's c-section rate with the entire obstetrics department.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"How One Hospital Brought Its C-Section Rate Down In A Hurry\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2015\\/05\\/10\\/how-one-hospital-brought-its-c-section-rate-down-in-a-hurry\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-05-10 09:01:10\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-05-11 09:12:39\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":25735,\"author_id\":\"240\",\"author_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"author_display_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"tags\":[\"Women's Health\"],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\",\"Tests &amp; Treatments\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2015\\/05\\/hoag-5-e1431121041697.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "The hospital's tools included sharing each doctor's c-section rate with the entire obstetrics department.", "title": "How One Hospital Brought Its C-Section Rate Down In A Hurry", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2015/05/10/how-one-hospital-brought-its-c-section-rate-down-in-a-hurry/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2015/05/hoag-2-400x267.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "women\\'s health", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Hoag also increased the percentage of women who had vaginal births after delivering previous children by C-section.\n\u201cHospitals don\u2019t do C-sections, doctors do,\u201d she said.\nThe C-section rate at the time, in early 2012, was about 38 percent.\nFor low-risk births (first-time moms with single, normal pregnancies), the rate dropped to about a quarter of births.\nIf patients want an elective C-section, they have to sign a consent form in the doctor\u2019s office that details the risks."}
