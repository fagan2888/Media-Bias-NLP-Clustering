For all those people out there who viewed the hacked nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence and numerous other celebrities that appeared online over the weekend, there is now a way to absolve yourself of your guilt.





Reddit users have set up a donations page on the Prostate Cancer Foundation’s website where people who viewed the photos can donate money “in honor of” Lawrence and the other celebrities. So far, the campaign, which has been promoted on the subreddit dedicated to the leak called “The Fappening,” has raised more than $6,000:

The joke, according to some of the Redditors donating to the cause is that since masturbation can help reduce the risk of prostate cancer, Lawrence has done her part to support the cause in the past.

As of Tuesday afternoon, the Reddit group is the top fundraiser for the PCF’s Safeway Foundation $1 Million Matching Grant Challenge.
