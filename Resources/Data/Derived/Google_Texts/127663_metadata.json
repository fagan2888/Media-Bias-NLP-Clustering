And yet if I had been asked to pre-select the winner, I would have drafted it.\n\nDean Wareham: I listened to that Daft Punk album all summer long. I suppose it\u2019s vapid, about as vapid as \u201cRock Around the Clock\u201d or \u201cSexual Healing.\u201d But I enjoy those songs too.\n\nI think Daft Punk has about as much soul as an aspirin commercial, and I don\u2019t think it makes me old to say so. I do like the Dawn of Midi album. And they are young. I think Daft Punk makes \u201cLet\u2019s Dance\u201d sound effervescent it\u2019s so dead inside, so calculated, so EXPENSIVE. The simulation of the human makes me want crawl under a rock. I want the actual, not the fraudulent, even if it\u2019s clever and shiny.\n\n\u201cSexual Healing\u201d has a great melody, and a great singer, and I would argue neither of these is present here (except perhaps during the Paul Williams number on \u201cRandom Access Memories\u201d). And if they were present, ephemerally, it would be because the French robots PURCHASED these things. And: I could make the argument that the lyrics of \u201cSexual Healing\u201d are the very opposite of vapidity. Perhaps dreadfully earnest, but not vapid.\n\nOK, you don\u2019t have to like it, but I will point out that this Daft Punk album (unlike their earlier ones) was recorded with real human beings; drummers, guitar players (including the guitarist who played on \u201cLet\u2019s Dance,\u201d but I guess you knew that). In fact a lot of Daft Punk fans were bitching about this when the album was released, that the record sounded old-fashioned. The Grammys are a joke but I think they got it right with \u201cGet Lucky.\u201d\n\nAnd maybe \u201cSexual Healing\u201d is the wrong choice for vapid lyrics. And most singers don\u2019t stack up to Marvin Gaye. And lyrics (especially in English) are not a strength for French bands. But I will leave you with this Lou Reed quote (from a guest DJ spot on WPIX in 1978): \u201cI like mindless disco . . . they say the lyrics are stupid and repetitious. So what\u2019s wrong with that? So is lying in the sun. Not everything has to be serious.\u201d\n\nI, too, like some disco. (Although if we are speaking of black music from the \u201970s I would rather listen to funk almost any day.) But I think an ahistorical imitation of disco that is created by a massive roundup of session players (yes, Nile Rodgers, et al.) does not square with art; it\u2019s just slavish imitation. About as interesting as Interpol\u2019s imitation of Joy Division, or Counting Crows\u2019 imitation of Van Morrison, etc. For me, the appearance of Pharrell Williams, a singer of almost no interest at all, is a sign of this imitativeness. Anyone, with the right Rolodex, could make this record.\n\nIn that main, this was the substance of our Facebook exchange. (And I am leaving out some fruitful ripostes from others, including my friend Harper Simon, who has a great and humane point of view on these issues.) At this point, I challenged Dean Wareham to a full-throated debate on the subject of Daft Punk. And this debate now appears below.\n\nDean Wareham: I accept your challenge. And I see your point about Counting Crows and Interpol being imitations of Van Morrison and Joy Division, respectively. But I am going to posit that Daft Punk are to disco what Sergio Leone is to the western: derivative, certainly, but dazzling and inventive, also.\n\nI suppose I could concede that \u201cGet Lucky\u201d is not a great \u201csong,\u201d per se; it will sound pretty silly with just piano or acoustic guitar. But it did not win song of the year at the Grammys. It won record of the year \u2014 an award supposedly given to the best performance or recording (though the history of the award is pretty awful over the last 40 years). Song of the year went to Lorde, a 17-year-old from New Zealand who was essentially poking fun of every rapper and rock star sitting at the Grammy Awards. \u201cRoyals\u201d is about sitting at home in a shit town listening to people sing about champagne and diamonds, and feeling very disconnected from them. And it is a song that can be covered (there is a very funny version on YouTube sung by a sad clown).\n\nI\u2019ve grown a little tired of \u201cRoyals\u201d at the moment, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever get tired of \u201cGet Lucky.\u201d It is six minutes of ecstasy (that is, if you have been listening to the superior album version, not the radio edit). And you are right that it is a triumph of sound (or perhaps a triumph of groove), rather than of songwriting. It\u2019s a simple song, a sex song. It appears to be about hooking up with a special person at a dance club (which is probably the best place to hear it, too). She\u2019s up all night to the sun / I\u2019m up all night to get some. Some what? And yes, it\u2019s all about the groove being played by Nile Rodgers, but whether he appears as himself, or as a facsimile of himself, his playing is so tasty on this song \u2014 and wherever he appears on the album \u2014 that he elevates everyone around him. Still, my favorite moment, among many enjoyable moments in this song, occurs about three minutes in; that\u2019s when the robotic Vocoder voice enters and you know you are in the presence of Daft Punk\n\nI\u2019m glad you mentioned KC & the Sunshine Band. \u201cGet Lucky\u201d has basically the same message as \u201cGet Down Tonight,\u201d and this too was probably written for the dance floor. KC and the Sunshine band are not my favorite disco act, but they seem to have played an important role in that movement. I would point to \u201cRock Your Baby,\u201d a defining song in the history of disco. It\u2019s not officially KC and the Sunshine Band \u2014 George McCrae sings and gets the credit \u2014 but they wrote and produced it. Their guitarist Jerome Smith\u2019s rhythm guitar track is a thing of beauty, and surely you hear echoes of that in the sound and patterns of Nile Rodgers. And according to my former drummer Stanley Demeski, \u201cRock Your Baby\u201d was the first radio hit to feature both a drum machine and a live drummer. Perhaps for you this is the moment everything started going downhill.\n\nDoesn\u2019t \u201cFamily Affair\u201d have the first drum machine on a top-40 hit? Oh, but maybe no live drummer too. As I have argued in the past (see my book, \u201cOn Celestial Music\u201d) the insistence on drum machines in black music is different from the use of drum machines in robotically inspired white dance music. I will concede that \u201cGet Lucky\u201d does fuse black music (Chic, in particular, but disco generally), with robot music, dehumanized white music that prizes its lack of humanism. But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s good.\n\nI can\u2019t find the vocoder interesting here because I already know about the vocoder from Kraftwerk (about whom I have mixed feelings, too). I also know about the vocoder from \u201cTrans\u201d by Neil Young. That album, which is fascinating in its meanness of spirit and its ahistorical mashing-up of traditions, seems to hate the vocoder in a way, and to render inert a naive, unreflective use of the vocoder. But the French robots apparently do not know about \u201cTrans,\u201d or rather, they are too cynical to care about \u201cTrans,\u201d and they bank (it\u2019s the operative word here) on the audience\u2019s lack of knowledge about the history of the vocoder. So they use it again and again like a neurological tic, and given that this vocoder section is the only appearance on this song of the actual robots rather than their surrogates\u2014the musicians who are hired to make the song sound as though it has actual soul\u2014it is inadequate as a sign of the auteurs.\n\nIn short, yes, Nile Rodgers appears here, and he seems to sound just like Nile Rodgers, or, at least, a Nile Rodgers who is mostly out of date, and the vocoder appears, and it sounds exactly like other robot-iterations of vocoder, and then there is the lyric, which you allude to above, and which is exactly as stupid as a KC and the Sunshine band lyric (and it keeps making me want to ask Why do you have to stay up all night in order to get lucky? Couldn\u2019t you have gotten lucky at 12 or 1?), indicating that this is a song assembled entirely from hitherto-existing pseudo-musical gestures.\n\nAnd I haven\u2019t gotten to the vocals yet. For me, Pharrell always sounds like one of the instances in which producers or composers sing who aren\u2019t really confident or interesting singers, like Bacharach singing his own songs, or Malcolm McLaren\u2019s later recordings on which he occasionally sang. He\u2019s a placeholder for a better singer, and it\u2019s a measure of the inadequacy of the album that he is the best that Daft Punk could do. Either that, or they actually wanted a not-very-good singer for their hit, as an acknowledgment that their whole project is bankrupt (which I sometimes suspect is the motive here). He is the barometer for what a mediocre singer sounds like (I only like him on the N.E.R.D. albums), and here performs to type, until the song gets to its B section, where they pile on the Earth, Wind & Fire harmonies. (What do you make of Earth, Wind & Fire\u2019s suppression of the serial comma, by the way?) This EWF passage is so exactly imitative of the harmonic intervals, and those falsetto harmonies of EWF, that it\u2019s almost laughable. Laughable if not so transparently cynical. Philip Bailey should be getting royalties on this song. Given that there is not one new thing on \u201cGet Lucky,\u201d not one new gesture, not one idea, whether in terms of arrangement, composition or performance, not one idea about music, where is the space in which its qualities are admirable. Where would the admiring take place?\n\nMeanwhile, I concede my shocking inability to get song of the year straight as regards the Grammys (I do not and have not watched them in years and years), but I am looking forward to talking about the rest of the album, if you are willing, because the rest is far worse.\n\nI find much to enjoy just in the first 30 seconds of \u201cGet Lucky.\u201d I don\u2019t know if you can call it admirable (yes, you can) but it works on my ears. It\u2019s a simple bag of tricks; they build it up, they break it down, removing the rhythm section and then bringing it back, much as Chic might have done, or the Rolling Stones in \u201978, or the Clash a couple of years later \u2014 anyone creating an extended dance mix. And these are pleasurable moments; the moment the bass reenters is tasty, and for me the entrance of the robo-vocal is surprising and exciting. Up \u2019til then it could be anybody. The track is a triumph of production and musicianship. New gestures? Not so much. Still, I don\u2019t think anyone else has done it better than this. And this is what Daft Punk do \u2014 they mine yesterday\u2019s trash, they recycle tired sounds but recombine them in new ways, and generally with humor and musical intelligence.\n\nIs it black music or white music? Well, like KC & the Sunshine band, or Giorgio Moroder and Donna Summer, it is both. And yes, they paid for it \u2014 just like any other big pop artist pays for session musicians \u2014 and yes, the album was expensive to make. They are operating much like David Bowie did on \u201cYoung Americans\u201d; he traveled to Philadelphia in search of the Philly soul sound, and enlisted Luther Vandross and Carlos Alomar. As you say, Steely Dan\u2019s \u201cAja\u201d album was equally expensive. That is an album which I can grudgingly respect for its musicianship and shiny grooves, when I hear it on the radio. But I won\u2019t put it on in the house; it makes me want to jump out the window. \u201cAja\u201d is an authentic \u201970s downer. \u201cRandom Access Memories\u201d is an upper.\n\nYou\u2019re right: Neil Young makes a complete mess of the vocoder on \u201cTrans.\u201d It doesn\u2019t suit his voice, but rather it destroys him; he sounds like some rock guy goofing around with a new toy. I imagine Daft Punk are well aware of that album; they seem to have a deep knowledge of trashy music from the \u201970s. Is the vocoder (or the Talkbox, which can generate a similar effect) their neurological tic? We know they did not invent it, and yet it is one of their signature sounds, part of their identity since their first hit in 1997 \u2014 \u201cAround the World.\u201d I think they are entitled to use it whenever they please, and we should not judge them for the fact that a thousand bad producers copied the effect in the years that followed.\n\nPerhaps you think this is their great flaw: the French dudes can\u2019t sing \u2014 especially in English \u2014 so they are reduced to either 1) bringing in guest vocalists or 2) hiding their voices behind a vocoder. Well yes, this is certainly an issue; it\u2019s something they have to deal with on each album. The same is true of of their counterparts in Air, another brilliant French duo who are not natural singers, which is why their best tracks are instrumental, or make use of a single word or phrase (see their recent song \u201cLove\u201d). But surely this absence of a singer is what makes Daft Punk what they are, and not just another band fronted by a guy who stands in front and sings about his feelings.\n\nIs Pharrell really a mediocre singer? You are not alone in this opinion, but personally I think he does a real nice job on his two tracks (and on his recent single \u201cHappy\u201d). He has a sweet, silky, natural-sounding voice, and he doesn\u2019t over-emote or stretch his vowels out to eternity like every other pop singer does these days. If you want \u201cgood\u201d singers, you can watch \u201cThe Voice\u201d on TV. They let you know how good they are every step of the way.\n\nThe rest of the album? We could start with the opener, \u201cGive Life Back to Music,\u201d which features Nile Rodgers at his best (whether he\u2019s out of date or not) or the stupendous \u201cLose Yourself to Dance\u201d (Williams\u2019 other vocal performance on the album). But I\u2019m afraid really this would just be the same discussion. You\u2019ll tell me it\u2019s just another copy of Chic with stupid lyrics about dancing. I\u2019ll answer that I like the groove, that I love the vocoder vocal that pans from left to right behind Pharrell\u2019s lead, and the way the backing vocals are arranged. I can\u2019t tell you how many guitarist friends went running to figure out how Nile Rodgers played that riff (OK, there were just two of us). I do know one other person who hates this song \u2014 my neighbor, she called at 2 a.m. to tell me that the bass was making her walls shake.\n\nDo you want to tell me what\u2019s so horrible about \u201cGiorgio by Moroder\u201d and \u201cTouch\u201d? Both clock in around 9 minutes, and both are pretty over-the-top, so there is a lot for you to hate.\n\nOK, I need to concentrate on your first paragraph for a moment, Dean, and then perhaps I will let go of \u201cGet Lucky\u201d (noting, in passing, that you do not dispute the Earth, Wind & Fire charge in my note above). If the simple buildup-and-breakdown methodology were enough for a song to be generally interesting, then any dance mix would be interesting. And perhaps this is the basic assertion of electronic dance music (which is what Daft Punk used to be), that any assertion of four-four is compelling, and enough to make you want to move. I find four-four tyrannical a lot of the time (which is why, e.g., I revere \u201cTrout Mask Replica,\u201d or the music of Ornette Coleman), and it is not a foregone conclusion that this is inherently compelling to me at all. But what about the dance floor, you say? I am reminded of Frank Zappa, on \u201cRoxy and Elsewhere,\u201d saying to audience members who had climbed up onto the stage to dance that if they could dance to this, they could really dance. I have no objection to dance (I like dancing, and at one time thought I was good at it), and I have no objection to dance music, I just don\u2019t agree with the idea that in order for music to be danceable that it has to have a certain neo-fascist time signature without rhythmical variation, most of it played, these days, by machines. To me this is the sound of corporate enterprise more than it is the sound of music.\n\nI physically and emotionally cannot understand the idea that four-on-the-floor is more interesting, or more danceable, and, relatedly, I can\u2019t understand that building up and breaking down is inherently interesting. I do love a break beat in hip-hop, mainly because I love the drumming on a break beat, but a break beat in EDM is just a chance for the digital processor to show that it can play 64th notes, or 128th notes, and all that does, for me is display the prowess of a computing device. And: The breakdown is a feature of all popular music (been to a square dance lately?), and therefore the breaking up and breaking down should recommend other idioms as well. But does not apparently. Which suggests that it is not the breakdown, unless there is something special about this particular building up and breaking down on \u201cGet Lucky.\u201d (P.S., what if Nile Rodgers\u2019 guitar part is sampled there? Then it\u2019s not a matter of physically playing the part. For me, it\u2019s important to remember the role that digital programming has in the vaunted organic sound of \u201cRandom Access Memories.\u201d)\n\nAnd then one last thought about the singing. Of course I\u2019m not saying bad singing renders a song uninteresting. There is a great range of \u201cbad\u201d singers I find enormously interesting, even profoundly moving: David Thomas, Don Van Vliet, Shane McGowan, Yoko Ono, Sun Ra, Neil Young, Patti Smith, Kim Gordon. And \u201cThe Voice\u201d often makes me want to run screaming from the room (see my recent review of Leona Lewis on the Talkhouse for more on this subject). I think Pharrell, however, is an example of a bad good singer instead of being an example of a good bad singer. The French robots might be bad good singers, but we will never know, because they hide behind the vocoder. Perhaps this is the secret of the vocoder, generally. Kraftwerk is hiding behind it because of the weakness of their vocals (though they sang a bit back in the day), and Daft Punk is hiding behind it, and all the hip-hop guys who seem to have fallen asleep at the mixing console while depressing the autotune button are hiding behind the autotuner, all to eliminate what\u2019s human about the playing, the actual sound of human beings playing the music and singing the melodies, on the occasions where there are actual melodies. But that\u2019s what makes music a human art form. The sound of humans.\n\nMy contention would be along the lines of Joe Strummer, who I believe said, after \u201cSandinista!\u201d: \u201cWe have to stop ripping off black music.\u201d I don\u2019t think Strummer was saying that there was something maladroit politically about playing black music (or a white refraction of black music), although there have been moments when that was a fruitful way of thinking about certain \u201ccrossover\u201d artists (Macklemore being the example du jour); I think Strummer was saying, in effect, Have we bothered to investigate fully what\u2019s here at hand? Part of my problem with the Hollywood sound of the very expensive \u201cRandom Access Memories\u201d (meaning, in this argument, the selective forgetting of one\u2019s origins) is that it conceals what is French, or it makes the argument that what is French is only \u201cripping off black music,\u201d when that is far from the truth. There\u2019s a whole history of African-American jazz and soul artists going to France for more respect (Nina Simone comes to mind), there\u2019s a whole history of French artists (Django Reinhardt) borrowing American idioms and bringing something nativist to them. But I feel like there\u2019s a quantum change in \u201cRandom Access Memories,\u201d in that what the French robots bring to the proceedings is that absence of the nativist. They bring superior hiring capabilities, and astute marketing.\n\nOne last observation and then I leave off for the day: How should we interpret the line \u201cGive Life Back to Music\u201d in the song of the same name? It\u2019s the opening track on the album \u201cRandom Access Memories,\u201d and therefore it seems like it has rhetorical importance. It starts with some more very effective rhythm guitar playing, and it has that annoying Wurlitzer arpeggio thing that is a characteristic of a lot of Bee Gees stuff from the mid-\u201970s, and right away the faceless robot voice comes in with an utterly vapid lyric that repeats over and over (like in \u201cWe Are Family\u201d), \u201cLet the music do tonight/just turn on the music/the music of your life/give life back to music.\u201d It has a sample of people on the dance floor, presumably, celebrating the deep and trenchant truths of the song. Longtime fans who dislike the fact that Daft Punk have abandoned what was \u201cpunk\u201d about the monotonous simplicity and minimalism of their early electronica presumably see this song as a rallying cry for this slightly disappointing album. Live musicians! So retrogressive! Give life back to music! How conservative! But I take it as a seriously ironic expression of the intent of the album. You say you think the album is in some way funny, and I would be interested to hear in what way is it funny, because for me it\u2019s more ironic than funny, and/or funny mainly in its very traditional irony. When a robot tells me to \u201cgive life back to music,\u201d I find it seriously ironic, and risible mainly in the shamelessness of its affront. Because there is so little for me on this album that feels like it has human life about it.\n\nI do, in fact, definitely want to talk about the Giorgio Moroder song, and especially the Paul Williams song (\u201cTouch\u201d), which is the one song I unabashedly like on the record, and \u201cMotherboard,\u201d which actually has some nice drumming on it. And strings! The irony! Do you want to start there?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Joyous, celebratory pop? Or soulless, vapid, plagiarized?
