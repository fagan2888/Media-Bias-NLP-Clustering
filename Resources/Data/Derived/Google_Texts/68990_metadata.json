That money goes back out to the agencies in our community who help serve the people in the community,\" said Taylor.\n\nVolunteers say because of all the bad publicity Panama City Beach received over Spring Beak, they wanted to come out to show tourists that Panama City Beach is still a family destination and locals care about our beaches.\n\n\"I think that if we come out here and show the tourists that are out here that we're cleaning up, we care. We do care we want to keep it beautiful for the people that come visit,\" said volunteer, Allenay Simpson.\n\nMany families used the opportunity as a learning experience for their kids.\n\n\"We thought it would be fun for them to give back and do something for their community that is tangible that they can see,\" said volunteer, Sabrina Parker.\n\nRon Jon Surf Shop donates up to $1,500 to United Way during the clean up. Ron Jon also raffled off a $400 surf board during the clean up this afternoon.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Panama City Beach's sugar white sands attract thousands of tourists to our shores every year, but in order to keep our beaches beautiful, they have to stay clean.
