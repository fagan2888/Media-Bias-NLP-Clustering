As Republican presidential candidates make bellicose demands for carpet-bombing and the use of torture, Sestak can show why such positions harm our standing in the world and support our enemies.\n\nFinally, Sestak knows how to be a leader. Democrats in Congress could use effective leaders.\n\n|Ted Lieverman, Philadelphia\n\nMcGinty would build on Obama's gains\n\nAs a teenager in 2008, I was inspired by then-Sen. Barack Obama's message of hope and change. I stepped up to join his presidential campaign then and again in 2012, reenergized by his tireless efforts to bring our country out of the Great Recession and to expand Americans' access to health care.\n\nLast week, Obama and Vice President Biden announced their support for Katie McGinty for Senate. Biden said her voice \"is sorely needed . . . to advocate for equal pay for women, a raise in the minimum wage, college affordability, and a quality education for every child.\"\n\nThe stakes are too high to sit out this race. This year's election will give Pennsylvanians a critical opportunity to pick a senator who will put the needs of hardworking residents above all else.\n\nThere is no endorsement I respect more than that of Obama. We deserve a leader who will defend and build on the work of our president and vice president to expand opportunity.\n\n|Jana Korn, Philadelphia, jana.korn@gmail.com", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "news", "og": {"url": "http://articles.philly.com/2016-04-07/news/72105521_1_joe-sestak-vice-president-biden-president-obama", "type": "article", "site_name": "philly-archives", "description": "ISSUE | CAMPAIGN 2016  Sestak offers experience, leadership  I've been a strong supporter of the Obama administration, but I was surprised to see President Obama and Vice President Biden jump into...", "title": "Letters: Sestak brings leadership; McGinty, Obama's backing"}, "fb": {"admins": 100001837105818, "app_id": 174828689230209}, "description": "ISSUE | CAMPAIGN 2016  Sestak offers experience, leadership  I've been a strong supporter of the Obama administration, but I was surprised to see President Obama and Vice President Biden jump into"}, "article_summary": "We deserve a leader who will defend and build on the work of our president and vice president to expand opportunity.\nLast week, Obama and Vice President Biden announced their support for Katie McGinty for Senate.\n|Ted Lieverman, PhiladelphiaMcGinty would build on Obama's gainsAs a teenager in 2008, I was inspired by then-Sen.
