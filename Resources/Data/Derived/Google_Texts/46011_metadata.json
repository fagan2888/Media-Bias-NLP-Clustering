Pregnancy, however, was not included under the federal law.\n\nMomentum for including pregnancy began to build earlier this year. But a consumer advocacy campaign seeking the rule change failed when Department of Health and Human Services secretary Sylvia Matthews Burwell denied the request, saying Medicaid could cover some qualifying low-income women and that others could sign up during the regular enrollment period.\n\nNew York City Comptroller Scott Stringer issued a report earlier this year outlining the barriers to health care access for pregnant women, and partnered with the legislation\u2019s sponsors, Senator Liz Krueger and Assemblywoman Aravella Simotas, to push for the bill\u2019s passage.\n\nThe legislation faced some opposition from groups such as the state Business Council and the insurance industry, which said it could create a slippery slope that would allow a number of conditions to become qualifying events for exchange enrollment.\n\nBut it faced no real opposition from lawmakers.\n\nUnder the legislation, women would become eligible to enroll from the point at which their pregnancies are certified through a blood test. The coverage would then be retroactive.\n\nIn a statement, Krueger called it \u201ccommon sense legislation.\u201d\n\nWomen\u2019s reproductive rights advocates also hailed the bill\u2019s passage.\n\n\u201cToday the New York State Legislature acted in the best interests of New York State by connecting pregnant women to insurance coverage at a time when access to health care is extremely critical to the health and long-term well-being of women and their children,\u201d Carol Blowers, interim C.E.O. of Family Planning Advocates of New York said in an emailed statement. \u201cAllowing pregnant woman to obtain health insurance removes a barrier that kept our most vulnerable New Yorkers at risk.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/albany/2015/06/8570450/bill-expand-health-coverage-pregnant-women-approved", "image": "http://www.capitalnewyork.com/sites/default/files/A%20-%20Liz%20Krueger_0.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Bill to expand health coverage for pregnant women approved"}, "robots": "all", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "Classifies pregnancy as a 'qualifying event'"}, "article_summary": "\u201cAllowing pregnant woman to obtain health insurance removes a barrier that kept our most vulnerable New Yorkers at risk.\u201d\nALBANY\u2014A bill allowing pregnant women to enroll in New York State\u2019s health exchange unanimously passed the Assembly Wednesday night and now heads to Governor Andrew Cuomo for his signature.\n\u201cToday the New York State Legislature acted in the best interests of New York State by connecting pregnant women to insurance coverage at a time when access to health care is extremely critical to the health and long-term well-being of women and their children,\u201d Carol Blowers, interim C.E.O.\nThe bill, which the Senate unanimously approved earlier Wednesday, would make New York the first state to classify pregnancy as a \u201cqualifying event\u201d for enrollment in the state\u2019s health exchange.\nUnder the legislation, women would become eligible to enroll from the point at which their pregnancies are certified through a blood test."}
