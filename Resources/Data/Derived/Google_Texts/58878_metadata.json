(AP) - Wild-horse advocacy groups are criticizing federal land managers\u2019 plans to permanently remove over 750 mustangs from the Nevada range beginning late next month.\n\nBut the organizations are split on the Bureau of Land Management\u2019s plans to treat as many as 250 mares with the fertility-control drug PZP-22 before releasing them back to the wild.\n\nThe agency plans to remove 460 horses from the Pine Nut Mountain, Fish Creek and Little Fish Lake herd management areas in its Carson City and Battle Mountain districts and 310 horses from the Humboldt and Wood Hills herd areas in its Winnemucca and Elko districts.\n\nThe removals are needed to reduce an overpopulation of wild horses on public lands, said Joan Guilfoyle, division chief of the Bureau of Land Management\u2019s Wild Horse and Burro Program. Herds grow at an average rate of 20 percent a year and can double in size every four years, according to the bureau.\n\n\u201cThe welfare of wild horses is always a top priority for the BLM and we remain committed to providing humane care and treatment as we and our contractors conduct gather operations in Nevada,\u201d Guilfoyle said in a statement.\n\nThough activists are unified in their opposition to the horses\u2019 removal, they offer differing opinions on the wisdom of injecting mares with PZP-22.\n\n\u201cPZP should never be used on wild horses,\u201d said Anne Novak of California-based Protect Mustangs. \u201cIt\u2019s made from slaughterhouse pig ovaries and shouldn\u2019t be injected into wild mares because it\u2019s risky and sterilizes them after multiple use.\u201d\n\n\u201cInjecting them with PZP is taking away their freedom to live as nature intended. Genetic variability is needed for survival but PZP messes with that \u2026 You shouldn\u2019t give a restricted-use pesticide to native wild horses who are underpopulated,\u201d she added.\n\nBut Deniz Bolbol of the American Wild Horse Preservation Campaign noted the National Academy of Sciences recommended the use of PZP birth control in a report to the Bureau of Land Management last year.\n\n\u201cYes, we strongly believe the BLM could and should use the PZP birth control vaccine as a proven and humane alternative to removals,\u201d she wrote in an email. \u201c(But) the BLM continues to vastly underutilize this cost-effective approach and sadly continues the unsustainable and cruel roundups and removal of mustangs from the wild.\u201d\n\n\u201cApplying PZP to only 250 mares in populations of horses that number in the thousands is insufficient to control and reduce population growth. It is clear the BLM is dead set on continuing roundups and not to humanely manage horses on the range,\u201d Bolbol added.\n\nAdvocacy groups say the Bureau of Land Management continues to \u201cstockpile\u201d horses at a growing cost to taxpayers with more mustangs now living in overflowing holding facilities than on the range. Government-funded pastures hold horses that aren\u2019t adopted by the public.\n\nAbout 47,500 mustangs reside in corrals and pastures in the West and Midwest compared with nearly 41,000 horses that lived in the wild as of November, according to the federal agency\u2019s latest figures. Nevada is home to over half of the free-roaming horses in 10 Western states.\n\nBudget constraints prompted the bureau to remove 1,863 wild horses and burros from the range during the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, down from 4,176 in 2013 and 8,255 in 2012.
