(WTVR) \u2013 President Barack Obama sat down with CBS 6 reporter Tracy Sears for a one-on-one interview Wednesday afternoon. The president answered questions during an eight-minute window. In that time we asked questions you wanted answered.\n\nPlease enable Javascript to watch this video\n\nTracy Sears: First of all, we have seen you a lot in Virginia this past presidential election and in Virginia in the past campaigning for various Democrats running for office, including Senator Tim Kaine. We haven\u2019t seen you with Terry McAuliffe just yet. Will we?\n\nPresident Obama: As you\u2019ve noticed, there\u2019s a lot of stuff going on around here. Trying to make sure we reopen the government and make sure America pays its bills. But as you might expect, I strongly support Terry McAuliffe. I think he\u2019s going to be a terrific governor for Virginia and as soon as we get this out of the way, I think you\u2019ll see a whole bunch of folks campaigning actively to make sure Mr. McAuliffe becomes the next governor.\n\nPlease enable Javascript to watch this video\n\nTracy Sears: There is so much at stake with this shutdown, particularly in Virginia where we have so many federal workers. How do you see -- or what do you see as the biggest impact to Virginia, to the Commonwealth right now.\n\nPresident Obama: Well, as you mentioned, there are a lot of people who work for the federal government. And one of the most frustrating things I\u2019ve seen in the political rhetoric is people denigrating federal workers. These are the folks who help veterans get what their benefits, help to keep us safe, help keep our water clean, help small businesses get loans. They work really hard. They don\u2019t deserve what\u2019s happening right now with this government shutdown. Right off the bat, you\u2019ve got hundreds of thousands of people across the country who aren\u2019t sure about their paychecks.\n\nThat also has an economic impact. It means the restaurants in Virginia, maybe they\u2019re not getting as many customers because some of those federal workers are worried and holding back on spending. It means that businesses who provide services to the federal government. They\u2019re not getting paid, so that may have an impact on their payroll. So the ripple effects of this across the board are particularly damaging for this area, for Virginia.\n\nThat\u2019s why what I\u2019ve said repeatedly is this is completely unnecessary. The reason we are where we are right now is because Speaker Boehner, the House Republicans, thought that they could get leverage in budget negotiations \u2013 or defund the Affordable Care Act: Obamacare \u2013 by taking us to the brink and essentially trying to hold the entire U.S. economy hostage.\n\nAnd what I\u2019ve said is, I\u2019m happy to negotiate \u2013 and Democrats have shown themselves happy to negotiate -- on any issue, but you can\u2019t threaten to shut down the government as means of getting leverage in negotiations. You\u2019ve got to take that off the table and I think most people understand that.\n\nTracy Sears: The House Majority leader said to us earlier this morning that he wants you to come to Capitol Hill. He wants to sit down. He wants to negotiate. He says it is your inability to do that that has caused this shutdown in the first place.\n\nPresident Obama: Look, anybody who has been following this understands that I meet and talk with John Boehner all the time. And we\u2019re prepared to negotiate on anything. I\u2019ve said that publically repeatedly. I saw him just last week and talked to him just yesterday.\n\nThe issue is not whether or not we can negotiate. The problem here is that in a normal negotiation, there are things I think are really important to help us grow the economy: making sure our infrastructure, our roads and bridges are rebuilt, making sure that early childhood education is funded so that young people have a chance to get ahead. And John Boehner has other proprieties.\n\nAnd in a normal negotiation another situation, you\u2019d sit there and you\u2019d say, ok, this is what you want, this is what I want. Nobody is going to get 100 percent of what they want. What Mr. Boehner has essentially said is unless I get what I want \u2013 completely -- then I\u2019m not going to reopen the government.\n\nWell, I don\u2019t understand, and I don\u2019t think most Americans understand, why do you need to shut down the government in order to have a negotiation? That doesn\u2019t make sense, I think, to most people. If most folks are having an experience\u2026 you know you\u2019re selling your house. The buyer offers you one price and you\u2019re offering to sell it for another. And the buyer says, well unless you take my price, I\u2019m going to burn down your house. I don\u2019t think people would call that a negotiation. They would say that doesn\u2019t make sense.\n\nWhat we need to do right now is, don\u2019t harm the American people. Put folks back to work. Reopen the government. Make sure America is paying its bills. And we\u2019re then in a position where we can have a good negotiation about how we move this country forward. I\u2019m eager to do that and I\u2019ve been asking the speaker to do this for the last year.\n\nTracy Sears: The sticking point here is health care reform, and there is a lot of concern and you met with Virginia workers back in 2009 when you were campaigning and you said too many families are being crushed by health care premiums. And you said in Virginia if they like their health care premiums they can keep them.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen since the passage of the ACA, premiums have increased; employers like the University of Virginia have dropped spousal support. Companies like Home Depot, community colleges have taken full time staff and made them part time. Are these anticipated consequences?\n\nPresident Obama: A lot of this stuff has been happening for the last year several years, that doesn\u2019t have to do with the Affordable Care Act, in fact premiums for the last three years have gone up at a slower rate than in any time in the last 50 years. So the problem that we had for a long time is that employers have found health care costs really burdensome, they\u2019ve been loading up off costs on to workers for a very long time.\n\nThey only thing the ACA has done is create a marketplace for people who don\u2019t have health care. What it\u2019s done is it\u2019s said you can now go and buy health care and its competitive, and it gives you choices, and if you still can\u2019t afford It, then we\u2019re going to provide you a tax credit to help you buy it.\n\nAnd what we\u2019ve already seen are thousands of people in Virginia who are currently benefiting and getting health insurance for the first time. And what we\u2019ve also seen is the system is beginning to get more efficient.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean that we are out of the woods. A lot of people are still hurting because there premiums are going up, their employers are shifting costs to them. That\u2019s why we have to keep working to improve the health care system. But that\u2019s not because of the ACA.\n\nTracy Sears: There are a couple of people from our viewers. Jennifer Moore asks: \u201cWhy are you going to fine people for not having health care, when in reality if we could afford health care then we would have it in the first place.\u201d\n\nPresident Obama: Well this is what is called the individual mandate and here\u2019s the problem.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have health care but you get sick and you go to the hospital, and those costs. Shifted onto people how do have health insurance.\n\nIn fact the average family pays thousands in premium per year that are hidden subsidies for people who haven\u2019t bought health care.\n\nSo what we\u2019ve said is that we are going to make health care more affordable with the ACA and what you get is a really good health care plan for less than your cellphone bill. So a lot of people say that they can\u2019t afford it and then they\u2019ve got a cellphone bill and they\u2019ve got a cable bill.\n\nFor less than a cellphone bill you can get this coverage.\n\nIf you still can\u2019t afford it you, we\u2019ll provide you with tax credits to buy it and if you still can\u2019t afford it after that we will give you a hardship waiver, because you\u2019ve shown you still can\u2019t afford it. But if you can afford it, then what you can\u2019t do is not buy health insurance and then have other people subsidize it.\n\nThe other part of this that\u2019s important is that unless you have everybody as part of a plan that are purchasing health insurance, you can\u2019t guarantee people with pre-existing conditions that they can get health insurance and one of the most important things about the ACA is that we now have a guarantee that even if you\u2019ve been sick before, even if you\u2019ve had breast cancer before, even if you\u2019ve had some kind of illness before\u2014but you\u2019re healthy now\u2014you are still able to buy health insurance that an insurer cannot deny you and you\u2019re basically charged the same as everybody else.\n\nBut the only way you can do that is make sure everyone is getting health insurance. That\u2019s a popular thing; everybody thinks you shouldn\u2019t get barred from insurance because of preexisting conditions.\n\nCBS 6 interactive producer Alix Bryan was also in Washington providing LIVE updates from the nation's capital.
