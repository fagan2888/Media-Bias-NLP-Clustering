WEST PALM BEACH — The only televised debate between Rep. Patrick Murphy, D-Jupiter, and Republican challenger Carl Domino produced clashes over Obamacare, immigration, U.S. ground troops in Iraq — and whether their congressional race is limited to the two names on the ballot or is a referendum on President Barack Obama.

Murphy and Domino debated for half an hour with WPTV anchor Michael Williams on Friday night. The debate will air on WPTV Channel 5 at 10 a.m. Sunday.

Representing a Republican-leaning district at a time when Obama’s popularity is plunging, Murphy has highlighted his willingness to vote with Republicans on some issues, including delays to some provisions of the Affordable Care Act, investigating the Benghazi attacks and finding email-losing IRS official Lois Lerner in contempt of Congress.

But Murphy voted against outright repeal of Obamacare, favors an immigration pathway to citizenship that Domino calls “amnesty” and voted with the rest of the Democratic caucus for Nancy Pelosi as speaker when the 113th Congress convened.

Given the national climate, Domino hopes that’s enough to sink Murphy in this year’s midterm.

“Barack Obama said it best: ‘You’re not voting for my name on the ballot. You’re voting for my policies.’ Patrick Murphy has been a strict adherent to those policies,” Domino asserted at the close of the debate.

“I think it’s our names on the ballot,” Murphy interjected as time ran out.
