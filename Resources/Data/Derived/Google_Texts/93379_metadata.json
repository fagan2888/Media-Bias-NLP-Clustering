In an introductory video last week, Dickerson suggested that taxes could be one subject the group could help simplify and make easier to understand.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The White House is giving new information about the minds behind the U.S. Digital Service.", "description": "The White House is giving new information about the minds behind the U.S. Digital Service.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Julian Hattem", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The White House is giving new information about the minds behind the U.S. Digital Service.", "title": "White House adds names to tech strike team", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/216253-white-house-adds-names-to-tech-strike-team", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-08-29T13:20:31-04:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2014-08-29T13:20-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/216253-white-house-adds-names-to-tech-strike-team", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2014-08-29T13:16-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Julian Hattem", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-29T13:16:09-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-29T13:20:31-04:00"}, "keywords": "US Digital Service,Mikey Dickerson,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/216253-white-house-adds-names-to-tech-strike-team", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The White House is giving new information about the minds behind the U.S. Digital Service.", "card": "summary", "title": "White House adds names to tech strike team"}, "dcterms.title": "White House adds names to tech strike team"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe4b1e\"", "article_summary": "The White House is giving new information about the minds that make up its new digital task force.\n\u201cThe Digital Service team and [the White House Office of Management and Budget] will work in collaboration with agencies to improve and simplify government digital services.\n\u201cThe U.S. Digital Service was created to replicate the success Dickerson had righting HealthCare.gov in other places where the government interacts with people over the Web.\n\u201cWe are continuing to build a team of tech experts that have mastered a variety of disciplines, including design, procurement, human resources, and finance,\u201d he wrote.\nAnother one is Jennifer Anastasoff, founder of a startup that tries to bring business leaders into state and local government."}
