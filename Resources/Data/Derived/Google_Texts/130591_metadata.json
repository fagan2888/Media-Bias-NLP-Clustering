Eisenhower believed that Confederate General Robert E. Lee should be a Role Model for American youth and they should emulate his qualities.\n\nRobert Edward Lee was born January 19, 1807 to Revolutionary War hero Henry \u201cLight Horse Harry\u201d Lee III and Anne Carter Lee at Stratford Hall in Westmoreland County Virginia. He attended the United States Military Academy at West Point where he graduated 2nd in the class of 1829 without a single demerit. Lee served in the U.S. Army for nearly 32 years.\n\nAt the beginning of the War Between the States (Civil War) he was offered command of the U.S. Army by Abraham Lincoln. He knew that Lincoln\u2019s invasion of the Southern States was unconstitutional, illegal, immoral, and criminal. He had to make a choice to either defend the Constitution or the Union. He made the correct decision to defend the Constitution.\n\nRobert E. Lee assumed command of the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia on June 1,1862 and the command of all 3 Confederate Armies in early 1865. After the collapse of the nation Confederate States of America he told his soldiers \u201cGo Home And Be Good Americans\u201d. He accepted the position of President of Washington College in Lexington Virginia. At a time when he desperately needed money a Northern Insurance Company offered him $50,000 for the use of his name. He declined saying \u201cmy name and heritage is about all I have left and it is not for sale\u201d. Robert Edward Lee died on October 12, 1870.\n\nNo finer example of a Southern gentleman and leader exists whose positive impact was so great during and after the war. His superb character as a Christian gentleman stood out in his life as a man, husband, father, citizen, soldier, and a leader. These qualities greatly impressed many notable men.", "article_metadata": {"rating": "general", "description": "General Robert E.
