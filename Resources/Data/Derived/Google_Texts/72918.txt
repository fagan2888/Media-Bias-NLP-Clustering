Fox News’ Stacey Dash took to her Facebook page this week to apologize for a recent comment she made about “bad girls” in which critics accused her of blaming rape victims.

“I apologize to anyone who believed I was blaming the victims of these horrible acts,” the former “Clueless” actress wrote Monday.

Ms. Dash was criticized for comments she made last week about University of Virginia sororities being banned from attending fraternity events.

“I just think it’s ridiculous, and I think it’s a good thing for the good girls … women to be told, ‘Stay home. Be safe,’ ” she said Friday. “The other bad girls — bad women — or the ones who like to be naughty, might go out and play and get hurt, and then, you know. But the other thing about this is that it then blames the alcohol instead of the person who over-drinks. It’s the same thing with guns. Guns don’t kill people; people kill people. Alcohol doesn’t get you drunk; you get yourself drunk.”

Ms. Dash explained in her Facebook post that she, too, is a victim of abuse and that the comment was simply a “failed attempt at humor.”

“After a failed attempt at humor about ‘good girls’ and ‘naughty girls,’ during my recent appearance on Outnumbered, I transitioned to the very serious issue of men blaming alcohol for their vile behavior,” she wrote. “LET ME BE CLEAR: I am a victim of physical and sexual abuse. My point was that there IS NO EXCUSE for a man taking advantage of women under any circumstances. I believe that these universities focusing on alcohol consumption as a means to stop evil behavior takes the focus off the real issue of the objectification of women and how that can be prevented.”
