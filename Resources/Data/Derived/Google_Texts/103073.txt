The healthcare sector has always been a good place to look for stocks to buy for the long term. After all, demographics alone will support growth for decades as nearly 80 million baby boomers retire. And now that the Affordable Care Act is the law of the land, healthcare companies are benefiting from millions of new customers who were previously uninsured.

Of course, some stocks to buy always have better growth or risk-reward prospects than others, and that goes even for defensive stocks such as those found in the healthcare sector.

For starters, itâ€™s not like the potential of healthcare stocks has been kept secret over the last few years. The case for finding healthcare stocks to buy because of aging has been an investing theme for a decade or more. And as for the Affordable Care Act, plenty of healthcare stocks started to rise well in advance of its ultimate implementation.

That said, healthcare spending is rising at such as sharp and steady clip that investors need to be on the lookout for healthcare stocks to buy that have plenty more upside ahead. The percentage of money Americans spend on healthcare sets a new record high every year. In 1990, 15% of all consumer spending went to healthcare. By 2009, that figured topped 20% and has inched up every year since.

The healthcare sector is wide and deep with stocks to buy, ranging from medical device manufacturers to real estate investment trusts (REITs), but they all should benefit from record consumer spending on healthcare.

Here are five stocks to buy to participate in this powerful trend:
