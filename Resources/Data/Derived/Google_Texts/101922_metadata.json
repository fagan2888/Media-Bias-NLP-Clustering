United, a Major League Soccer team, is going to be helping to publicize Obamacare's new exchange. Wait, you may be asking \u2014 how can this be happening? Earlier this summer, the Obama administration, attempting to copy a Massachusetts campaign to use the Red Sox to publicize Romneycare, floated a plan to enlist the National Football League to raise awareness of the new health care exchanges. In response, Republican leaders sent a threatening letter to the NFL warning it to stay out. And, for good measure, it sent the same letter to all the other major leagues: Major League Baseball, National Basketball Association, National Hockey League, Professional Golf Association, and NASCAR.\n\nExcept (and I certainly didn't notice this at the time) the list of leagues the Republicans threatened does not include Major League Soccer \u2014 reflecting either the Republicans' failure to realize that Major League Soccer exists, or a principled refusal to recognize soccer as a legitimate sport. I didn't think it was possible to find a way to make Republicans hate soccer more than they already do, but it associating it with Obamacare may just do it.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#000", "description": "Boehner and McConnell score their own goal.", "generator": "the-factory", "og": {"site_name": "Daily Intelligencer", "description": "Boehner and McConnell score their own goal.", "title": "Republican Hatred for Obamacare Undermined by Republican Hatred for Soccer", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/09/gop-obamacare-hate-undermined-by-gop-soccer-hate.html", "image": "http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/slideshows/2012/11/david-beckham-galaxy/76155684_10.w1200.h630.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Boehner and McConnell score their own goal.", "creator": "@jonathanchait", "image": "http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/slideshows/2012/11/david-beckham-galaxy/76155684_10.w190.h190.2x.jpg", "title": "GOP Obamacare Hate Undermined by GOP Soccer Hate", "site": "@intelligencer", "card": "summary"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Daily Intelligencer", "fb": {"app_id": 120608177953522}, "msapplication-TileImage": "//cache.nymag.com/media/di/icon.144x144.png", "application-name": "Daily Intelligencer", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "the national interest, politics, obamacare, john boehner, mitch mcconnell", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NewYorkMag", "tag": "the national interest,politics,obamacare,john boehner,mitch mcconnell", "published_time": "2013-09-12T14:41:00.000Z", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/JonathanChaitPublic"}, "topics": "topics-test, the national interest, politics, obamacare, john boehner, mitch mcconnell", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe03cd\"", "article_summary": "D.C.
