It\u0092s the third year of open enrollment for these subsidized plans, established by the Affordable Care Act. Many Texans still oppose the law, even though the state is home to the most uninsured people in the country, 4.4 million residents.\n\nThe uninsured rate in Texas is 19 percent. There are multiple reasons: the number of low-wage jobs in Texas that don\u0092t offer benefits, cultural and language barriers, and political opposition to health reform. Another reason is that Republican leaders have not expanded Medicaid to more poor people, as 30 other states have done. That part of the law is optional, but by declining the expansion, Texas loses out on billions of dollars in federal funds every year.\n\nThere is growing pressure for Texas to expand Medicaid, and supporters are now looking for the right political message that could bring the parties together.\n\nFor the moment, Republicans still consider the Affordable Care Act to be political kryptonite. Senator Ted Cruz continues to criticize it. Attorney General Ken Paxton just filed another lawsuit attacking part of it. Governor Greg Abbott has said he won\u0092t consider the Medicaid expansion, because he considers Medicaid a dysfunctional entitlement program that should not be allowed to expand.\n\nHelpful links Houston-area assistance and upcoming enrollment events: Enroll Gulf Coast National enrollment website and hotline: Healthcare.gov Find a licensed insurance broker or agent: National Association of Health Underwriters zip code search.\n\nIn Houston, local leaders want the expansion. Harris County Judge Ed Emmett, a moderate Republican, has supported it for years. The CEO of the taxpayer-supported Harris Health System, George Masi, says he needs the revenue that Medicaid expansion would bring. He\u0092s had to lay off more than 100 employees, and cut back on charity care.\n\n\u0093What is even more profound is that money is going to other states that expanded Medicaid, like New York, California, Connecticut,\u0094 Masi said. \u0093And so the taxpayer of Texas is being penalized, if you will, for not taking advantage of that option.\u0094\n\nBy emphasizing the impact on taxpayers, Masi and others are framing the issue in terms of economics rather than humanitarian concerns.\n\n\u0093We call it a paradigm shift,\u0094 Masi added. \u0093It\u0092s a different way of thinking.\u0094\n\nGovernment leaders and health advocates from across Houston point out that the costs of caring for the uninsured fall heavily on local institutions. Those patients strain the budgets of hospitals, first responders, and even jails.\n\nLast week, Masi welcomed the the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services to Houston, where she toured a Harris Health clinic.\n\nSecretary Sylvia Burwell said she is willing to work with state leaders to craft a unique Medicaid plan for Texas. She\u0092s done that with other Republican governors.\n\nShe, too, dangled the economic benefits of accepting more federal money under the law. She pointed to Kentucky, which did expand Medicaid .\n\n\u0093In Kentucky alone, which is obviously a much smaller state than the state I\u0092m now visiting, the expectation is we will see an increase of 40,000 jobs by 2021 and $30 billion into the state\u0092s coffers. So that\u0092s something,\u0094 Burwell said.\n\nIn 2013, the Texas legislature took no action on Medicaid expansion. The same thing happened this year.\n\nBut more voices are starting to push for change, according to Ken Janda, who runs Community Health Choice, a not-for-profit insurance company in Houston.\n\nJanda said the Texas Medical Association and the Texas Hospital Association are both being more vocal on the issue, as is the Texas Association of Business. The federal Medicaid funds would help the state budget, and inject revenue into the medical sector of the economy.\n\n\u0093Doctors\u0092 offices are able to hire more people. Pharmacies are able to hire more people. That becomes an economic multiplier,\u0094 Janda said.\n\nCounty budgets would benefit as well, because they support safety-net clinics and public hospitals such as Ben Taub, part of the Harris Health system.\n\n\u0093If Texas expanded Medicaid, we would be able to look at reducing local property taxes across the board in all counties, or use those dollars for something besides healthcare,\u0094 said Janda.\n\nJanda says the new emphasis on economics could eventually bring the parties together.\n\n\u0093There is some interest now by some Republican state senators because of the potential to reduce local property taxes,\u0094 he added.\n\nJanda isn\u0092t naming names yet. He also says don\u0092t expect to see any movement on this issue until after the 2016 presidential election. But he says he is \u0093guardedly optimistic\u0094 that Republicans will be willing to discuss a possible Medicaid expansion after that.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Affordable Care Act", "description": "Supporters of more Medicaid in Texas are increasingly arguing for the financial benefits", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/2015/11/01/125587/open-enrollment-for-obamacare-starts-rhetoric-shifts-on-texas-debate-over-medicaid-expansion/", "type": "article", "site_name": "Houston Public Media", "description": "Supporters of more Medicaid in Texas are increasingly arguing for the financial benefits", "title": "Open Enrollment For Obamacare Starts; Rhetoric Shifts On Texas Debate Over Medicaid Expansion | Houston Public Media"}, "org_id": 220, "twitter": {"description": "Supporters of more Medicaid in Texas are increasingly arguing for the financial benefits", "creator": "@houstonpubmedia", "url": "https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/2015/11/01/125587/open-enrollment-for-obamacare-starts-rhetoric-shifts-on-texas-debate-over-medicaid-expansion/", "title": "Open Enrollment For Obamacare Starts; Rhetoric Shifts On Texas Debate Over Medicaid Expansion", "site": "@houstonpubmedia", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Carrie Feibel", "wordCount": 766, "datePublished": "2015-11-01T05:49:22+00:00", "fb": {"admins": 37511993, "app_id": 1520489194943572, "pages": 27589213702}, "bitly-verification": "7777946f1a0a", "article": {"section": "News", "tag": "uninsured", "published_time": "2015-11-01T05:49:22+00:00"}, "keywords": "Affordable Care Act, Health & Science, News, Affordable Care Act, medicaid, obamacare, texas, uninsured", "google-site-verification": "QOrBnMZ1LXDA9tL3e5WmFUU-oI3JUbDRotOWST1P_Dg", "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "But he says he is \u0093guardedly optimistic\u0094 that Republicans will be willing to discuss a possible Medicaid expansion after that.\nGovernor Greg Abbott has said he won\u0092t consider the Medicaid expansion, because he considers Medicaid a dysfunctional entitlement program that should not be allowed to expand.\nThat part of the law is optional, but by declining the expansion, Texas loses out on billions of dollars in federal funds every year.\nThe CEO of the taxpayer-supported Harris Health System, George Masi, says he needs the revenue that Medicaid expansion would bring.\nAnother reason is that Republican leaders have not expanded Medicaid to more poor people, as 30 other states have done."}
