Walt Disney Imagineering, of which Pausch had once been a member, makes Disney theme parks, resorts, attractions, cruise ships, real estate developments and regional entertainment venues worldwide.\n\n\u201cIt's been a lifelong dream to become an Imagineer,\u201d Ho said. \u201cRandy Pausch was a huge reason I came to Pittsburgh and moved myself across the country.\u201d\n\nHo and teammates Angeline Chen, 20, a junior of Cupertino, Calif., Christina Brant, 23, of Canfield, Ohio, and John Brieger, 21, of Sacramento, Calif., took first place in the national competition that combines creativity with engineering skills. The students were among 24 finalists from six universities.\n\nThe theme of this year's 23rd annual contest was to design an experience for a large city that transforms it for the enjoyment of its citizens and visitors. The experience had to take advantage of the infrastructure.\n\nThe CMU undergraduates won the contest with \u201cAntipode,\u201d a two-week festival of cultural exchange in Bangkok and Lima, Peru. Magical \u201cwhispering trees\u201d serve as portals and leak out memories between the two cities.\n\nThe team examined aspects of each city's culture, such as the masks their people wore.\n\n\u201cBasically, we believe that through learning about another culture, you learn about your own culture by examining differences and similarities,\u201d Brant said.\n\nThe competitors were judged on a 15-minute presentation complete with renderings, architectural drawings and maps.\n\nSecond place went to California Institute of the Arts for \u201cTime Embassy,\u201d an attraction that allows guests to experience Rome during the Italian Renaissance in a time-traveling taxi. UCLA took third place for \u201cIlhavela,\u201d an extravaganza that leads visitors and locals on a chase through Rio de Janeiro.\n\nCMU finished second last year and in 2012.\n\nThe top team won $3,000 plus $1,000 to be divided among the sponsoring university or organizations. The six teams of finalists visited Walt Disney Imagineering in Glendale, Calif., from Jan. 27-31.\n\nBill Zlatos is a staff writer for Trib Total Media.
