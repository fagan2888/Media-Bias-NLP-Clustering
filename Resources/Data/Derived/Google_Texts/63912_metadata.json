Republicans are quick to seize on rate hikes as further proof that President Barack Obama\u2019s signature law isn\u2019t doing enough to hold down health care costs for the average consumer.\n\nInsurers in California have submitted initial rates for 2017, but the final figures won\u2019t be known until July after state officials conduct private negotiations.\n\nUse Our Content This story can be republished for free ( details ).\n\nPeter Lee, executive director of Covered California, underscored that the estimate was preliminary but said some one-time factors under the Affordable Care Act mean \u201c2017 will be an adjustment year\u201d for rates.\n\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t put too much focus on this 8 percent number when we will know the reality in two months,\u201d Lee told California Healthline on Tuesday. \u201cThere are a number of reasons 2017 will have higher rate increases than the last few years. But we believe in California we won\u2019t see the significant headwinds many other states are experiencing.\u201d\n\nLee said the expiration this year of two federal programs that have helped health insurers offset expensive medical claims and cover sick patients in general will affect premium rates across the country. In addition, he cited ever-increasing medical costs, particularly for expensive specialty drugs.\n\nThe nation\u2019s largest health insurer, UnitedHealth Group, already has said it will exit all but a handful of state exchanges after suffering substantial losses on individual policies.\n\nLee declined to comment on whether UnitedHealth has submitted a bid to continue selling in Covered California next year.\n\nHealth-policy experts said the California rate projection mirrors an upward trend around the country as health insurers reassess their pricing and strategy under Obamacare.\n\n\u201cNone of us should be surprised to see average rate increases that are slightly higher than last year,\u201d said Sabrina Corlette, a research professor at Georgetown University\u2019s Center on Health Insurance Reforms. \u201cIt\u2019s still really difficult to discern where we will end up.\u201d\n\nRobert Laszewski, a health care consultant in Alexandria, Virginia, and a frequent critic of Covered California, said Californians will be fortunate if the 8 percent projection holds up.\n\n\u201cThat is not a troubling rate increase,\u201d he said. \u201cCalifornia is coming back toward the average. A bunch of states would die for just an 8 percent increase in 2017.\u201d\n\nA bigger concern, Laszewski said, is the tepid growth in Covered California\u2019s enrollment and what that may mean for future premiums.\n\nAs part of its proposed budget for the next fiscal year, starting July 1, the state exchange expects its annual enrollment to grow by only 2 percent over the next year to 1.34 million. Covered California counts about 1.4 million as currently enrolled but that figure is expected to drop to 1.32 million as of June 30 through normal attrition as people get insurance elsewhere or drop coverage.\n\nSign-ups are crucial for keeping a diverse mix of enrollees and spreading the insurance costs across a pool of healthy and sick policyholders.\n\nAbout 3 million Californians remain uninsured, but fewer than 1.4 million of them are eligible for premium subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, according to the exchange\u2019s proposed budget.\n\nLee said California already boasts one of the healthiest risk pools in the country, which insurers have cited as a main reason for the lower-than-average rate increases the past two years. He said the exchange signs up hundreds of thousands of new enrollees each year, but that\u2019s offset by high turnover as many people leave the marketplace for job-based coverage, Medicare or Medicaid.\n\nThe average tenure of a Covered California enrollee is about 25 months, according to exchange data.\n\nOver time, Covered California expects the gradual increases in the state\u2019s minimum wage to $15 an hour could shift more low-income people from Medi-Cal, the state\u2019s Medicaid program, to subsidized exchange policies as their pay increases. By 2020, the exchange expects to reach enrollment of 1.52 million.\n\n\u201cCalifornia grew very rapidly in the first few years and now we have reached a cruising altitude after three years. We are projecting modest net growth,\u201d Lee said. \u201cI think any questions about the sustainability [of exchanges] are just pure hot air.\u201d\n\nCovered California\u2019s five-member board will discuss the proposed $308 million budget at a meeting Thursday and vote on it next month.\n\nThe proposed budget for 2017 is 8 percent lower than the current year budget, reflecting the slower enrollment growth and the fact that Covered California must operate next year without federal startup funds for the first time.\n\nThe exchange is planning to draw on $58 million in reserves for operations, and it wants to raise its surcharge on customer policies to 4 percent of premiums, up from 3.4 percent now, or $13.95 per member per month.\n\nCovered California doesn\u2019t receive money from the state\u2019s general fund and relies on policyholder assessments to pay for marketing, service center operations and other expenses.\n\nHealth insurers have urged the exchange not to pass on any unnecessary costs to consumers.\n\n\u201cPrice is the number one factor impacting consumers when they enroll, so we must always keep an eye toward affordability,\u201d said Charles Bacchi, chief executive of the California Association of Health Plans. \u201cWe urge Covered California to move cautiously before increasing this fee and look for cost savings.\u201d\n\nThe exchange is proposing to spend $2 million to establish an ombudsman program to help resolve customer service problems.\n\nConsumer groups have criticized Covered California for failing to fix long-standing enrollment and tax-related errors that have blocked people from getting coverage and left some with unforeseen bills.\n\nLast month, federal lawmakers called on Covered California to resolve a problem that has caused some pregnant women to be dropped from their health plans and enrolled in Medi-Cal without notice or consent.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely, some consumers have had problems with customer service,\u201d Lee said. \u201cWe are making significant investments to do better.\u201d\n\nThis story was produced by Kaiser Health News, which publishes California Healthline, a service of the California Health Care Foundation.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The projected \u00a0increase in premiums is expected to draw national attention in an election year -- especially from foes of the Affordable Care Act.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "Kaiser Health News", "description": "The projected \u00a0increase in premiums is expected to draw national attention in an election year \u2014 especially from foes of the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Obamacare Premiums In California May Rise 8 Percent Next Year, State Predicts", "url": "http://khn.org/news/obamacare-premiums-in-california-may-rise-8-percent-next-year-state-predicts/", "image": {"width": 770, "identifier": "https://kaiserhealthnews.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/covered-california-enrollment-770.jpg", "height": 513}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://kaiserhealthnews.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/covered-california-enrollment-770.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@khnews", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@khnews"}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://khn.org/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico", "application-name": "Kaiser Health News", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WordPresscom", "published_time": "2016-05-11T13:21:52+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-11T18:33:35+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "El-hccfbhMd9lv-h8wAfp8Qu5KhqI8hjJMi1-CefIoQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe are making significant investments to do better.\u201dThis story was produced by Kaiser Health News, which publishes California Healthline, a service of the California Health Care Foundation.\nLee declined to comment on whether UnitedHealth has submitted a bid to continue selling in Covered California next year.\nHealth-policy experts said the California rate projection mirrors an upward trend around the country as health insurers reassess their pricing and strategy under Obamacare.\n\u201cThere are a number of reasons 2017 will have higher rate increases than the last few years.\nConsumer groups have criticized Covered California for failing to fix long-standing enrollment and tax-related errors that have blocked people from getting coverage and left some with unforeseen bills."}
