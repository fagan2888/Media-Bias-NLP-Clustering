Trump held a rally at West Chester University\u2019s Hollinger Field House at 4 p.m. on Monday, April 25.\n\nTrump spoke on a variety of topics, including his proposed border wall, illegal immigration, drugs coming in from Mexico, Obamacare, the veterans, education and his opponents in the Republican primary.\n\nDescribing the success of his campaign, Trump said, \u201cThere\u2019s a movement going on.\u201d\n\nHe spoke about the massive success of his campaign, referencing crooked polls that he beat and the 17 Republicans who were originally running for president. Amidst a cheering crowd, Trump spoke of his plan for jobs.\u201cWe\u2019re not going to let foreign countries steal our companies,\u201d said Trump. He cited that Pa. has lost more than 35 percent of its manufacturing jobs since 2001.\n\nTrump also said he would increase jobs. He said, \u201cYou leave us, you fire all of our people, you think you\u2019re going to go to Mexico and sell [your products] back. Well, there will be consequences.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on debt and trade relations, he said, \u201cChina is sucking the life out of us. I don\u2019t blame China; I do business with China. China is great. I blame our politicians!\u201d\n\nAnother major issue in the Trump campaign focuses on illegal immigration. Trump said, \u201c[Politicians are] bringing in people from Syria. We don\u2019t know them.\u201d His plan involves having the Gulf states pay for a safe zone in Syria.\n\nTrump also referenced the tragic deaths of several people who had been raped and killed by illegal immigrants in the last several months, as an example of the need for stricter boarder control. Trump spoke of drugs pouring in over the southern borders as well.\n\nReferring to our 19 trillion dollars in debt, Trump said it was due to \u201cbad trade deals.\u201d He, on the other hand, said, \u201cI\u2019m self-funding my own campaign. It\u2019s a lot of money, and I\u2019ve spent less than anybody else essentially, and I\u2019m in first place by a lot.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re last on the list in education, but first on the list for cost per pupil,\u201d Trump said about education reform. He also said he would get rid of Common Core.\n\nAs president, Trump said he would also increase funding for our military. \u201cWe going to un-deplete our depleted military. No one\u2019s going to mess with us, and we\u2019re never going to have to use it. Other than [when we] knock out ISIS.\u201d This was met with roaring cheers from the crowd.\n\nOther than policy issues, Trump spoke about his opponents in the presidential race. He referred to Ted Cruz as \u201clying Ted\u201d and John Kasich as \u201c1 in 42 Kasich,\u201d referencing Kasich\u2019s losses. He referred to them joining forces as a \u201ccollusion.\u201d\n\nTrump said about Kasich, \u201cDid you ever see a man eat like this\u201d while he mimicked Kasich. \u201c[The food] is falling out of his mouth. That\u2019s not presidential.\u201d Later, he again referenced this, saying, Kasich is a \u201cstubborn guy who eats like a slob and shouldn\u2019t have press conferences while he\u2019s shoving [food] down his throat.\u201d\n\nWhen speaking on the \u201crigged\u201d political system, Trump said, \u201cIt\u2019s almost as crooked at Hillary Clinton.\u201d The crowd cheered in approval. He said that Bernie Sanders has no chance of winning against her, unless she\u2019s indicted for her email scandal and foundation scandal.\n\nTrump spoke kindly of Bernie and referenced the media, saying Bernie couldn\u2019t win, in spite of his many wins throughout the country. Then, however, Trump said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to run against a communist.\u201d\n\nHe said that the only way Cruz or Kasich have a chance is a second ballot, but his campaign would win on the first. While speaking on his opponents, someone in the crowd shouted, \u201cTalk about the real issues.\u201d The crowd jeered as the person was thrown out, and Trump said, \u201cGo home to your mother.\u201d\n\nTrump encouraged the crowd to vote in the primary tomorrow. He said that in many years, they will consider it the greatest vote they have ever cast. \u201cYou are going to be proud of your president, but I don\u2019t care about that. You are going to be proud of your country!\u201d he said.\n\nOverall, thousands gathered to see the candidate speak. Trump said there were \u201cnine thousand people outside\u201d who couldn\u2019t get into the rally.\n\nDoors for the rally opened at 1 p.m. and the line quickly went around the block. Before Trump came to stage, gatherers chanted things like \u201cBuild that wall,\u201d \u201cWe want Trump,\u201d and \u201cUSA\u201d while music played.\n\nWhen the rally was initially announced on campus, multiple protest Facebook pages cropped up, including: \u201cDump Trump,\u201d \u201cA Peaceful Protest Against an Unpleasant Man,\u201d and more.\n\nInterim President, Chris Fiorentino, explained that Public Safety would be present for the event to ensure everyone\u2019s safety.\n\nIn response to protests from students about the university allowing Trump to hold the rally, Fiorentino also said, \u201cThe bigger and perhaps more complex concern relates to the emotional safety of our students, faculty and staff. With regard to that concern, a university should not be an intellectual safe space. Rather, students should be exposed to diverse ideas and prepared with the skills to assess their merits.\u201d\n\nOn the day of the rally, hundreds of students also gathered on Church Street to protest. Students held signs like, \u201cNo more walls\u201d and yelled things like, \u201cTrump hates women.\u201d Students played instruments and chanted.\n\nTheresa Kelly is a fourth-year student majoring in English literature secondary education.
