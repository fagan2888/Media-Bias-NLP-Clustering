House Republicans are targeting both this week with an obscure procedural move that could finally advance opposition bills to President Barack Obama's desk.\n\nThe procedure is called budget reconciliation, and legislation advanced that way cannot be filibustered in the Senate, is subject only to limited amendments and needs only simple majority votes to pass, according to House and Senate rules.\n\nIt would then be up to Obama to veto the measures, which he would be all but certain to do. But the process would move two cherished GOP goals through the Senate, pushing them further than they've ever gotten before.\n\n\u201cObamacare remains as unpopular as ever, and this package gives us our best shot to put a repeal bill on the president\u2019s desk,\" said Brendan Buck, a spokesman for House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), who is leading the Obamacare attack and rolled out his plans Monday.\n\nCongress set up the moves last spring when it passed a budget plan that included reconciliation provisions -- essentially instructions for various committees to draw up legislation targeting the Affordable Care Act and other unspecified issues. Senate committees are expected to take similar steps to those in the House.\n\nRyan's legislation targets the ACA by ordering the repeal of several key parts of the law, including the mandate for people to purchase health care, the cost-controlling Independent Payment Advisory Board, a tax on medical devices, and the so-called \"Cadillac plan\" tax on high-cost health insurance.", "article_metadata": {"description": "House Republicans have a plan to get their bills past the Senate.", "sailthru.expire_date": "2015-09-29 14:02:39 -0400", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "House Republicans have a plan to get their bills past the Senate.", "title": "GOP To Launch New Assault On Obamacare, Planned Parenthood", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gop-republicans-obamacare-planned-parenthood_us_560965d2e4b0768126fe3f35", "image": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/5609669b1900002f00fde8ab.jpeg?cache=gbldqko06m", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "House Republicans have a plan to get their bills past the Senate.", "creator": "@mmcauliff", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/5609669b1900002f00fde8ab.jpeg?cache=gbldqko06m", "height": 1000}, "title": "GOP To Launch New Assault On Obamacare, Planned Parenthood", "site": "@HuffPostPol", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-09-28 14:02:39 -0400", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_560965d2e4b0768126fe3f35", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "Obamacare,Affordable Care Act,ACA,budget reconciliation,Paul Ryan,fred upton, Obamacare Repeal,Planned Parenthood,Republicans,GOP,2016 election,Elections 2016,Barack Obama", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "Obamacare,Affordable Care Act,ACA,budget reconciliation,Paul Ryan,fred upton, Obamacare Repeal,Planned Parenthood,Republicans,GOP,2016 election,Elections 2016,Barack Obama", "published_time": "2015-09-28 14:02:39 -0400", "modified_time": "2015-09-30 11:09:46 -0400", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/MichaelGMcAuliff"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf932\"", "article_summary": "WASHINGTON -- Planned Parenthood and Obamacare are probably the two things the GOP hates most.\nBut the process would move two cherished GOP goals through the Senate, pushing them further than they've ever gotten before.\nHouse Republicans are targeting both this week with an obscure procedural move that could finally advance opposition bills to President Barack Obama's desk.\nIt would then be up to Obama to veto the measures, which he would be all but certain to do.\nSenate committees are expected to take similar steps to those in the House."}
