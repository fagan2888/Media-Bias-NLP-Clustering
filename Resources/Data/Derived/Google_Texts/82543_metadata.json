The organization \u201creinforces the bonds that we already had as combat veterans,\u201d he said.\n\nEach member has a \u201croad name,\u201d such as Farmer, Popcorn, Rev Ray or Animal. On their motorcycle vests, each wears a pin depicting a dinosaur, because this, Strecker said, is a \u201cdinosaur club\u201d with no legacy memberships. Once these members die out, the organization will end. The youngest member is 60.\n\nOnly those who served a combat tour in Vietnam can belong. Navy veterans who were in the Vietnam theater, or zone, and Air Force veterans who flew in the combat zone also can be members. Strecker said the group obtains each applicant's military record from the federal government to verify that he served in the Vietnam War.\n\nIn Country Vets Motorcycle Club raised about $20,000 over the past year from chili feeds, hog roasts, motorcycle poker runs and other fundraisers to give money to American Legion homes, VA hospitals, homeless veterans centers and other veterans' causes.\n\nStrecker said Vietnam War veterans typically arrived in American airports alone from the war, a far different scene from the ceremonies and greetings that have welcomed veterans over the past 20 years from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nVietnam veterans fought in an unpopular war. Strecker said he changed out of his military uniform and into civilian clothing as soon as he landed in the United States because he anticipated derision.\n\nRoy \u201cJudge\u201d Love of the Elkhorn area, the Nebraska state president of In Country Vets Motorcycle Club, said World War II was viewed as a heroic war and it frustrated him to \u201cget told I wasn't in a real war.\u201d\n\nThe wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have brought on a change in attitude toward all veterans, Strecker said, and they now are thanked for their service. Some members of the organization find this odd, Strecker said.\n\nThey take more comfort from the presence of others who fought in the Vietnam War. Strecker said: \u201cWe wanted to associate with men that went through what we went through.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Omaha.com", "description": "A group strictly for Vietnam veterans formed 19 years ago to share a love of riding, support one another and raise money for vets of all wars.", "title": "In motorcycle club, Vietnam veterans find open roads and open arms", "url": "http://www.omaha.com/news/in-motorcycle-club-vietnam-veterans-find-open-roads-and-open/article_377bd689-38e0-5e04-a64d-38cff8490cb1.html", "image": "http://omaha.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/og-image.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@OWHnews", "card": "summary"}, "description": "A group strictly for Vietnam veterans formed 19 years ago to share a love of riding, support one another and raise money for vets of all wars.", "fb": {"app_id": 117714391577072}, "keywords": "news", "google-site-verification": "gE-kSjgMAF16OyUU3QCB0Ap0PQnFlh5oPdueJO6D2cQ", "news_keywords": "news"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde8bc\"", "article_summary": "Only Vietnam War veterans know what they endured in the war and after they came back.\nThey take more comfort from the presence of others who fought in the Vietnam War.\nAnd so a group called the In Country Vets Motorcycle Club, strictly for Vietnam veterans, formed 19 years ago to share a love of riding, support one another and raise money for vets of all wars.\nStrecker said the group obtains each applicant's military record from the federal government to verify that he served in the Vietnam War.\nVietnam veterans fought in an unpopular war."}
