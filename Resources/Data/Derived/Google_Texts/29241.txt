INDIANOLA, Iowa (AP) - A 20-year-old counselor at a church youth camp in southern Iowa has been accused of sexually assaulting a colleague.

Warren County sheriff’s deputies have arrested Asa Bruss, of Cedar Falls, and were holding him Friday in the county jail. He faces four counts of sexual abuse. Online court records don’t list the name of an attorney who could be contacted to comment on Bruss’ behalf.

An 18-year-old counselor at Wesley Woods Camp and Retreat Center in Indianola told deputies that Bruss had sexually abused her at the camp last month.

The camp is run by the Iowa Conference of the United Methodist Church. A conference spokesman, Arthur McClanahan, says camp counselors go through a rigorous background check and that parents should feel safe in sending their children to the camp.
