His comments were in stark contrast to the dire warnings issued last week from National Security Director James Clapper, as well as increasingly grim reports coming from the region.\n\nDuring an interview on ABC\u2019s This Week that aired Sunday morning, Kerry described a more optimistic outlook of the U.S.\u2019s fight against ISIS than Pentagon officials have indicated.\n\nRelated: Carter Says Plan to Destroy ISIS Just Needs \u2018Tweaking\u2019\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re growing in the capacity on the ground,\u201d Kerry said. He also acknowledged that while progress is being made in Iraq, Syria is proving more challenging.\n\n\u201cEach time the Iraqis have now gone forward in an offensive effort, together with allies, the coalition, we have routed ISIL,\u201d Kerry said. \u201cIn Iraq, they have gained back a significant percentage of the area that ISIL is controlling.\u201d\n\nHis statements came weeks after the White House sent a war authorization to Congress that includes a three-year Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF). It has been criticized by Republicans who say President Obama\u2019s request doesn\u2019t go far enough to destroy ISIS, since it limits the use of forces on the ground.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner said on CBS\u2019s Face the Nation on Sunday morning that U.S. boots will have to be on the ground in order to defeat the vicious terror group. \u201cSomebody\u2019s boots have to be on the ground,\u201d he said.\n\nRelated: ISIS Burns 8000 Rare Books and Manuscripts in Mosul \u200b\n\nHowever, the White House has distanced itself from advocating for the use of ground troops \u2013 fearing mission creep. Instead, it\u2019s relying on airstrikes and building up Iraqi forces to defeat ISIS, which Kerry contends is working so far.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a great deal of energy and effort being put into this and I am confident that over time, we will beat, we will, indeed, degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL, yes,\u201d Kerry said.\n\nLast week Clapper told Congress that in 2014, terror attacks reached their highest level since the Pentagon has tracked them. The majority of the attacks have come from ISIS.\n\nRelated: 9 ISIS Weapons That Will Shock You\n\nClapper told the Senate Armed Services Committee that airstrikes and Iraqi forces have weakened ISIS but that the group remains a \u201cformidable and brutal threat\u201d as it tries to spread its ideology across the world. It wants to \u201ccreate both the substance and maybe more importantly the image of this global-scale caliphate.\u201d\n\nSeparately, the FBI\u2019s top counterterrorism official, Michael Steinbach, told lawmakers last week the U.S. is losing the fight against ISIS online.\n\nThe group, Steinbach said, \u201chas proved dangerously competent at employing online tools for its nefarious strategy.\u201d That strategy includes sharing videos of beheadings and violent executions of its hostage across the Internet.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Secretary of State John Kerry insists the U.S.", "title": "Kerry Insists U.S. Is Winning Against ISIS", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/01/Kerry-Insists-US-Winning-Against-ISIS", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/07252014_ISIS.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/01/Kerry-Insists-US-Winning-Against-ISIS", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/07252014_ISIS.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Secretary of State John Kerry insists the U.S.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Related: Carter Says Plan to Destroy ISIS Just Needs \u2018Tweaking\u2019\u201cWe\u2019re growing in the capacity on the ground,\u201d Kerry said.\nSecretary of State John Kerry insists the U.S. is on its way to success in the effort to destroy ISIS in Iraq and Syria.\n\u201cEach time the Iraqis have now gone forward in an offensive effort, together with allies, the coalition, we have routed ISIL,\u201d Kerry said.\nInstead, it\u2019s relying on airstrikes and building up Iraqi forces to defeat ISIS, which Kerry contends is working so far.\nDuring an interview on ABC\u2019s This Week that aired Sunday morning, Kerry described a more optimistic outlook of the U.S.\u2019s fight against ISIS than Pentagon officials have indicated."}
