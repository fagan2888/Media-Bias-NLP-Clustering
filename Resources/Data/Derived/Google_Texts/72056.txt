Fuquay-Varina is gearing up for the grand opening of the town's first splash pad, posting a live cam of the construction and rules for the spot.

The celebration is set for 10 a.m., Wednesday, at South Park, 900 S. Main St. Admission and activities are free. The morning includes a ribbon-cutting ceremony, ice pops, T-shirts (one per person) and bounce houses. Admission to the splash pad will continue to be free this summer. It's slated to stay open through Labor Day and possibly beyond depending on the weather.

The 6,000-square-foot splash pad is shaped like a pentagon and includes lots of jets of streaming water from more than 35 water features. The water won't be continually spraying. It starts shooting out the water when it's in use.

Fuquay-Varina has a live cam of the construction so you can follow the progress of the splash pad construction. Vortex Aquatic Structures International, Inc., the leading design and manufacturer in the industry, helped Fuquay put the splash pad together.

The town also is installing a new picnic shelter in the park next month and upgrading the playground this fall.

The town has published some rules and regulations for the splash pad, which will be under video surveillance and regularly monitored. Here are the rules, according to the town's website:
