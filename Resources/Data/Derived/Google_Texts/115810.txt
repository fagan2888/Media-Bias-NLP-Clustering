Former Fairview High School star wide receiver Kenny Bell was drafted by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the fifth round with the 162nd pick in the 2015 NFL draft.

The 6-foot-1, 185-pound Bell is the son of former Denver Broncos’ Ken Bell. The 23-year-old had 181 catches for 2,689 receiving yards and 21 touchdowns during his four-year career at the University of Nebraska.

“I had talked to the coaching staff at the combine,” Bell said to the media after being drafted. “I loved everything about the Bucs staff. I’ve actually got a hometown friend, (tight ends) coach Jon Embree, who’s a close family friend of mine. There wasn’t much of an inkling, but I can’t really explain how excited I am to be a Buccaneer.

“It’s a dream come true, to say the least.”

Bell was a Denver Post All-Colorado selection in high school.
