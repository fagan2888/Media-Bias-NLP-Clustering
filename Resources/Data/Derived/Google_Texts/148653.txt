A video that’s gone viral shows Iron Man actor Robert Downey Jr. giving a young Central Florida boy, Alex Pring, a bionic arm that looks like Iron Man’s. That arm was made by a non-profit group called Limbitless.

Its founder, Albert Manero, is a University of Central Florida engineering graduate student and a Fulbright Scholar working toward his PhD.

He spoke with 90.7’s Nicole Creston.
