Tallahassee, FL-- A few local players were guests of the Florida State Seminoles yesterday at Doak Campbell Stadium.

Bay sophomore standout defensive end Janarius Robinson ended up leaving with the offer of a lifetime.

Janarius met with Seminoles head coach Jimbo Fisher and officially received a scholarship offer from the defending national champions.

The 6'5", 224 pound Tornado who finished last season with six sacks already has offers from Clemson, Tennessee, and USF.

He was joined in Tallahassee by teammate, offensive lineman Christian Gainer, who the Noles didn't offer, but are actively looking at.

Janarius' Twitter avatar shows a picture of himself in his #81 Bay High jersey, as well as the new Seminole logo he had even before FSU made their offer official.
