(REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst)\n\n4244343\n\n\u201cEveryone is entitled to his own opinion,\u201d former Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan liked to say, \u201cbut not to his own facts.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, when it comes to the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision on Hobby Lobby, Americans are getting more of the former and less of the latter.\n\nIn this case, a fairly moderate decision exempting the owners of a company who want to exercise their rights of conscience \u2014 their hope misguided or noble, to be conscientious objectors in the sexual revolution \u2014 should have been universally applauded but has instead been demonized as \u201canti-woman.\u201d\n\nThe facts are these: Hobby Lobby is a chain of arts and crafts stores, which, upon discovering that the Affordable Care Act, aka ObamaCare, would mandate it provide birth control products, decided to offer just 16 of the 20 FDA-approved contraceptive options (covering only the drugs they viewed as \u201cpreventive,\u201d while not covering the four they believe to be abortifacients).\n\nJustice Samuel Alito, who authored the majority opinion, declared that closely held corporations (thought to be family-owned and not publicly traded) could not be forced to pay for contraceptive coverage that violated their deeply held religious beliefs.\n\nThe 5-4 decision was based on the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, bipartisan legislation signed by President Bill Clinton in 1993. In short, the decision declares that the mandate \u201cimposes a substantial burden on religious exercise\u201d and that there are \u201cother ways in which Congress or HHS could equally ensure that every woman has cost-free access to the particular contraceptives at issue here and, indeed, to all FDA-approved contraceptives.\u201d\n\nThis is all nuanced, but you wouldn\u2019t know that by the reaction of some of America\u2019s feminists, who instantly sought to misrepresent the decision. And I\u2019m not talking about Ms. Magazine \u2014 or random people on Twitter who might not have known better. Everyone from filmmaker and actress Lena Dunham to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton got it wrong, and one presumes, at least in some cases, intentionally.\n\nIn a tweet heard \u2019round the world, Dunham declared, \u201cWomen\u2019s access to birth control should not be denied because of their employer\u2019s religious beliefs.\u201d This would be a valid point were it not for the fact that nobody can deny women birth control. Hobby Lobby was already covering 16 of the 20 options; women always had the right to purchase whatever they wanted from the drug store on their own and, as Alito argued in his majority opinion, the government might likely decide they have a compelling interest to pay for the contraception.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very troubling that a salesclerk at Hobby Lobby who needs contraception, which is pretty expensive, is not going to get that service through her employer\u2019s health-care plan because her employer doesn\u2019t think she should be using contraception,\u201d said Hillary Clinton at the Aspen Ideas Festival this week \u2014 a canard which earned her \u201cTwo Pinocchios\u201d from the Washington Post\u2019s fact checker.\n\nRather than applauding the government\u2019s flexibility in making an accommodation for people of faith, the Left decided to play identity politics. The decision \u201cfeatured all three women justices ruling for the workers, and all five Catholic men ruling for the corporation,\u201d observed a writer at The Nation \u2014 one of many who thought it appropriate to cite the gender and religion of the Justices in the majority.\n\nThe really bad news is that there continues to be a major incentive for activists and politicians to stoke division and anger \u2014 even when that requires constructing a simplistic, or even false, narrative. The Hobby Lobby decision (and the reaction to it) is merely the latest example of this unfortunate trend.\n\nHaving invented a bogus \u201cwar on women\u201d concept to help defeat Mitt Romney in 2012, one can only imagine that whoever is unlucky enough to run against Hillary Clinton will be tagged as a misogynistic troglodyte who encourages gender pay inequality \u2014 and perhaps even rape?\n\nUnfortunately, we the people are the collateral damage in this supposed \u201cwar on women.\u201d And if the most brutal wars are so-called\u201dcivil\u201d wars, pitting brother against brother, then pitting male against female, husband against wife, is simply unconscionable.\n\n\u201cTo make an omelette you need not only those broken eggs but someone \u2018oppressed\u2019 to beat them,\u201d observed Joan Didion in her classic 1972 essay, The Women\u2019s Movement. She was, perhaps, ahead of her time in figuring out the Left\u2019s political strategy for winning the future: \u201cThey had invented a class; now they had only to make that class conscious.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Matt K.
