In participating states, a student\u2019s parents would still be required to contribute some amount of money (dependent on the family\u2019s income) and the student would be expected to work 10 hours a week to help pay for school. Students would also pay for books, housing and other expenses, so Clinton\u2019s proposal falls short of the universal \u201cdebt-free\u201d college proposed by many liberal advocates. Still, the rest of students\u2019 tuition would be state-funded, thereby eliminating the need to take out loans for tuition itself. And under this system, the millions of students who receive Pell Grants could use them to offset some non-tuition expenses, so that bloc of students could graduate with little out-of-pocket college cost and no debt.\n\n\u201cUnder my plan, tuition will be affordable for every family,\u201d Clinton said at a town hall meeting in New Hampshire. \u201cStudents should never have to take out a loan to pay for tuition at their state\u2019s public university.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t Clinton\u2019s first policy address since launching her campaign, but it\u2019s arguably her most ambitious: the \u201cNew College Compact\u201d would cost $350 billion over the course of a decade. But given the size of our economy and federal budget, investing $35 billion a year in covering tuition costs is arguably a manageable sum and money well spent.\n\nIndeed, as she often does, Clinton characterized the initiative as an economic growth strategy, arguing yesterday that \u201cmaking college affordable and available\u201d is \u201cone of the single biggest ways we can actually raise incomes.\u201d\n\nLike any national initiative worth pursuing, implementing the \u201cNew College Compact\u201d would be difficult. Not only would Republicans oppose these investments reflexively, but much of Clinton\u2019s plan is built on a federal-state partnership \u2013 Clinton believes, accurately, that one of the key drivers of high tuition costs is states cutting back on higher-ed spending. Her plan helps states by expanding federal investments, but it also expects to help keep costs down at state colleges and universities.\n\nAnd any plan that\u2019s dependent on states\u2019 cooperation can be inherently tricky, as Affordable Care Act proponents can tell you.\n\nAs for Clinton\u2019s Republican rivals, many of them complained about the \u201cNew College Compact.\u201d Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) described it as \u201c a 20th-century outdated model,\u201d which seemed odd given that nothing resembling Clinton\u2019s plan existed in the 20th century.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Hillary Clinton's \"New College Compact,\" making higher education more affordable, is her most ambitious initiative to date.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/under-my-plan-tuition-will-be-affordable-every-family", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "Hillary Clinton's \"New College Compact,\" making higher education more affordable, is her most ambitious initiative to date.", "title": "'Under my plan, tuition will be affordable for every family'", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/under-my-plan-tuition-will-be-affordable-every-family", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/rtx1ne2j.jpg?itok=j1EDJSVC", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/under-my-plan-tuition-will-be-affordable-every-family", "image": {"width": 830, "identifier": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/rtx1ne2j.jpg?itok=ryVL6OeE", "height": 553}, "title": "'Under my plan, tuition will be affordable for every family'", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Hillary Clinton's \"New College Compact,\" making higher education more affordable, is her most ambitious initiative to date."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2015-08-11T08:00:20-04:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "steve-benen", "tags": "democrats,education,education-policy,election-2016,elections,higher-education,hillary-clinton,rachel-maddow-show", "title": "'Under my plan, tuition will be affordable for every family'", "published": 1, "date": "08/11/2015 08:00:20 EDT", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/under-my-plan-tuition-will-be-affordable-every-family"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/steve.benen"}, "abstract": "Hillary Clinton's \"New College Compact,\" making higher education more affordable, is her most ambitious initiative to date.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Democrats, Education, Elections, Election 2016, Education Policy, Higher Education, Hillary Clinton"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb79f\"", "article_summary": "\u201cUnder my plan, tuition will be affordable for every family,\u201d Clinton said at a town hall meeting in New Hampshire.\nStill, the rest of students\u2019 tuition would be state-funded, thereby eliminating the need to take out loans for tuition itself.\nAnd any plan that\u2019s dependent on states\u2019 cooperation can be inherently tricky, as Affordable Care Act proponents can tell you.\nBut given the size of our economy and federal budget, investing $35 billion a year in covering tuition costs is arguably a manageable sum and money well spent.\nHer plan helps states by expanding federal investments, but it also expects to help keep costs down at state colleges and universities."}
