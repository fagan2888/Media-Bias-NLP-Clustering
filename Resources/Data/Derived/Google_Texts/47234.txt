What could business do to improve the business climate in the U.S.?

ROBERT PLANT: The need to improve the business climate in the U.S. is not just an economic imperative but an ethical one. For the last few decades, the prevailing business model has been to export manufacturing to external sites of production, predominantly in Asia. However, while the benefits of low-cost sourcing lead to a virtuous cycle of low-cost products, higher profits and in the short term happy shareholders, it also leads to a negative spiral of skill erosion, innovation decay, intellectual-property leakage and unemployment over the long term. As such, the emphasis on outsourcing has to be reconsidered and a more balanced sourcing approach adopted if the country is to prosper over the long term, provide jobs for its population and build a skill base for the future.

The initial buds of this are being seen as leading firms such as Ford and Caterpillar have embraced reshoring. This is not just a noble act on their part. It is based on sound economics as well as an eye on the future. These and other companies have embraced new technologies, methods of production and re-engaged with their communities to enable this to happen.

GE, another reshoring pioneer, opened a plant in Louisville, Ky., to produce their GeoSpring Water Heater. The plant has enabled the company to cut the price of the heater to consumers 20% below the costs of an Asian sourced product.

Business leaders, therefore, should look closely at embracing reshoring for their own products as well as using their lobbyists to promoting it within the political-legislative arena. The “Made in the U.S.A.” model has benefits for both the firms and the population within which they reside, building a better society and prosperous economy for all.
