Bill O'Reilly has Arsenio Hall's stamp of approval.

When Hall stopped by the HuffPost Live studio to chat about his new talk show, he told host Marc Lamont Hill he watched Hill appear several times on O'Reilly's show, where the pair sparred over various issues. Hall said he admires O'Reilly's willingness to have Hill back again and again no matter the outcome of their conversation.

"Bill has battled with you more than once, which means even though you defeated him sometimes, he's game to have somebody smart there to do it with him," Hall said.

The comedian praised O'Reilly for not seeking out guests he knows he can beat in a debate.

"He could have said, 'Bring me a sacrificial lamb. ... I need somebody right off the plantation,'" Hall said. "But the bottom line is he let you keep coming, which let me know something about him -- he really wants to allow there to be two distinct sides. I like that."
