Bicha said 76 percent of Coloradans on Medicaid and 40 percent of those who receive food assistance also are working.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"They may not have access to full-time jobs or enough hours in the work that they are doing,\" he said. \"You can work full time in Colorado at minimum wage and still be eligible for food assistance.\"\n\nBirch said as Colorado has leaned in on the Affordable Care Act and created its own solutions, officials have chosen to modernize parts of the system. One of those things this year will be changing the name \"Medicaid\" to \"Health First Colorado.\"\n\n\"What we know is people get treated differently sometimes when there's a poverty stigma attached,\" she said. \"We are pleased that the Affordable Care Act allowed us to get almost 94 percent of Colorado covered.\"\n\nShe said nearly 3,300 adults in Fremont County were able to become covered through the expansion of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\"Those folks are paid for with 100 percent federal funds, but it brought jobs to this county and it created more economic opportunities to get jobs, to get dental services to become healthier to get back to work, and it helped us financially in the state,\" she said.\n\nThe initiative brought $3.82 billion into the state, created 31,000 new jobs and increased annual household earnings by $643.\n\nBirch said Medicaid or CHP+ members may download the PEAKHealth mobile app to find a doctor, view their Medicaid card, keep information up to date and more.\n\nParticipants must have an account on Colorado.gov/PEAK. Medicaid and CHP+ members can create a PEAK account anytime at Colorado.gov/PEAK.
