Lawmakers have bitterly sparred over the measure \u2014 Democrats say Republicans tucked abortion restrictions into the measure, while GOP senators note that the Hyde Amendment has long been on the books as a provision to prevent abortion funding. However, both parties will come to the table once again during a vote scheduled for 11 a.m.\n\nThe measure sparked intense lobbying from Planned Parenthood, which joined Senate Democrats in filibustering the bill. However, the politicking by pro-abortion interests on the Senate floor reflects a desperate effort by the abortion lobby to protect its bottom line over victims of human trafficking. During a press conference yesterday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called on Democrats to stop blocking the bill. \u201cThis ridiculous fight over language that they\u2019ve already voted for frequently in the past really needs to stop so we can move forward with this very important human trafficking bill,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cThis is no minor issue, and once we do that, then we\u2019ll move on to consider the president\u2019s nominee for Attorney General.\u201d Planned Parenthood and abortion groups continue to oppose the measure. \u201cThe Senate should protect victims of human trafficking but should not do so at the expense of women\u2019s access to safe and legal abortion,\u201d said Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood.\n\nAcross the board, the abortion giant\u2019s actions show that the latest political maneuvering is business as usual. The corporation\u2019s legacy of cover-up demonstrates its willingness to protect its bottom line over victims of human trafficking. Richards\u2019 statements are a reflection of Planned Parenthood\u2019s egregious profiteering, placing abortion above protecting vulnerable women and children.\n\nPlanned Parenthood has been caught repeatedly aiding and abetting child sex-traffickers, covering up lawbreaking and sending victims back into the arms of their sexual abusers.\n\nLive Action undercover investigations expose the abortion giant\u2019s willingness to help pimps obtain secret abortions for their child sex slaves. In abortion facilities across the country, Planned Parenthood employees illegally offered to help child sex-traffickers by knowingly providing them abortion, birth control, and STD testing.\n\nTime and time again, Live Action\u2019s undercover cameras exposed how Planned Parenthood is not only willing to cover up cases of human trafficking and child sexual abuse, but offers vulnerable victims abortion as the healing solution to an act of violence.\n\nPlanned Parenthood\u2019s latest round of abortion politics solidifies a long history of profiting off of victims. After all, it\u2019s abortion-first ideology trumps all.\n\nUpdate: The vote scheduled for 11am has been canceled. There will be no vote until next week.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Live Action News", "description": "923 Like889 Tweet26 +18 A\u00a0revived battle over human trafficking legislation will resume\u00a0today in the U.S. Senate, with lawmakers contending over a provision of the bill that would prevent abortion\u00a0funding.
