The parents of freelance journalist James Foley, who was the first American hostage to be killed by ISIS, believe that Barack Obama could have done more to save their son but chose not to

“The government wasn’t really telling us anything. It was all classified,” Foley’s mother Diane Foley said during an appearance on America’s Newsroom on Friday, blasting the Obama administration for “poor” communication.

She continued:

“We didn’t feel Jim was a priority, even though we were told that from the very beginning that he was and just to trust that everything was being done. But we don’t have very much evidence of that… No one seemed to be accountable for these four Americans who were captive together. No one could give us answers.”

“Jim was very hopeful and confident that our government would find a way,” she added. “We don’t want Jim to have died in vain.”
