It\u2019s not a coincidence that Republicans have held off voting on Zika funding until the crisis has already cost at least one life and destroyed at least one American child with microcephaly. The more desperate people are for protection against this threat, the more of their lobbyists\u2019 wish lists they can add to the bill.\n\nThere have been exactly zero congressional hearings on the proposed trucking rule changes. None. That testimony Dana Logan gave about the accident that ended four lives? That was an attempt to get Congress to at least listen to drivers before extending the hours. It didn\u2019t work.\n\nDemocrats tried this week to cut Zika funding into a separate bill. That was blocked by Republicans who know a gravy train when they see it.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) took to the floor Wednesday to argue that the larger bill could easily get tied up in Congress\u2019 dysfunctional process, and be stalled until the fall \u2014 well after the money will be needed. The Zika spending should be broken out, they argued. But Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) objected, and instead asked her to modify her request in a way that Republicans might prefer.\n\nWhat did Cornyn\u2019s \u201cpreferred language\u201d include? All together now: gutting Obamacare.\n\nThe difference between Republican panic over Ebola and Republican slow-walking Zika funding? With Ebola, Republicans knew as well as anyone there was no real threat at that time, so they could play it up as much as they liked; turn it into another excuse to claim President Obama was \u201cweak\u201d for not closing the airports, sounding the alarms, and shooting a missile at someone.\n\nWith Zika there really is a crisis. And a real threat to real children? That\u2019s something they\u2019re not going to waste. That\u2019s an opportunity that doesn\u2019t come along every day. Clean Water Act? Trucking Safety? Hell, this thing might be worth a pipeline. Or maybe a few million acres of oil leases. Work the phones, boys. It\u2019s fundraising season.\n\nOh, eventually they\u2019ll pass some funding for fighting mosquitoes. Not enough to do the job\u2014that would be effective government, and if there\u2019s one thing they can\u2019t allow, it\u2019s a government that even appears to be working\u2014but they\u2019ll pass enough to go home and take credit for it. But it\u2019s not going to come without a price.\n\nMeanwhile, over in the House, they\u2019ve actually passed their bill which provides less than 1/3 of the requested funds.\n\nHouse Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers (R-Ky.) repeatedly took to the floor on Wednesday to reject claims from Democrats \u2013 as well as some Republicans in vulnerable Southern states \u2013 that the bill will insufficiently fund the U.S. response to the virus threat. \u201cThis is wholly adequate, it\u2019s more than adequate in terms of money,\u201d Rogers said minutes before the vote.\n\nThe bill gets it\u2019s money by gutting funds already allocated for fighting Ebola in Africa. But most of the bill simply comes from re-naming a bill to relax regulation of pesticides.\n\nHouse Republicans are renaming a bill that fights environmental regulations on pesticides and reframing it to fight the Zika virus. ... The pesticide bill, introduced last year by Rep. Bob Gibbs (R-Ohio), would prohibit the EPA from requiring permits to spray pesticides near bodies of water as long as the application has been approved by a state and the pesticides themselves are federally approved.\n\nSteal some Ebola funding. Slap a little lipstick on a pesticide bill. Call it a done.\n\nJust wait. There are still Senate votes and a whole conference committee ahead. If Republicans wait until enough people are infected, maybe they really can get Democrats to agree to weaken Obamacare.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Daily Kos", "description": "It\u2019s not enough for Republicans to\u00a0hijack Zika funding and use it as an excuse to gut the Clean Water Act.\u00a0Before they\u2019ll agree to save the lives of both children and adults threatened by Zika, they want another payment.
