(Robert Casillas /Staff Photographer)\n\nTwo local health care programs have teamed up to offer at-risk and low-income residents integrated behavioral and medical health services at a single health center in Harbor Gateway.\n\nA grand opening ceremony was held Wednesday for the Torrance Health and Wellness Center, which lauds itself as a one-stop shop for receiving psychotherapy, occupational therapy and psychiatry services along with primary medical care, immunizations, HIV testing, dental care and family planning.\n\nStaff from South Bay Family Health Care, one of the county\u2019s leading community clinics offering quality, low- and no-cost health care, and SSG\u2019s Occupational Therapy Training Program join forces at the center, located at 19401 S. Vermont Ave.\n\nThe clinic is centered on a simple premise \u2014 mental and physical health are symbiotic.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t fix the physical if you don\u2019t take care of the mental, emotional and spiritual. We can\u2019t just treat the top of the iceberg, we have to treat the cause,\u201d said Bernard Hardy, chief medical director of South Bay Family Health Care. \u201cMost of the people having issues with diabetes and stuff like that have underlying psycho-social issues.\u201d\n\nHardy noted that Los Angeles County has the highest risk of secondhand smoke exposure for youth, and the highest incidence of the young not getting immunizations.\n\nHardy and others said the center is located in an area in dire need of comprehensive health services.\n\n\u201cWe have the most diverse population. We have kids whose parents, because of psycho-social situations, have mental instability, and the kids suffer emotional hurt,\u201d Hardy said. \u201cThat impacts their compliance. They miss school, they don\u2019t perform as well.\u201d\n\nSuzanne Afuso-Sugano, division director of OOTP, said the occupational therapy program has been in the Vermont Avenue location for many years, offering mental health services. But staff members were concerned that their patients might not be getting their primary health care needs met.\n\n\u201cWe were trying to get them to go to the doctor, and that might not be happening,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause they\u2019re familiar with our therapists and coming to (our clinic), they are more likely to come here.\u201d\n\nKonza Mitchell, clinical services manager of South Bay Family Health Care, said they have some patients who have never been to a doctor or received vaccines and they\u2019re already 7 or 8 years old.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll probably see patients who have never been seen by a pediatrician,\u201d she said. \u201cOur goal is to see as many patients as we can and get all kids vaccinated.\u201d The new center has a psychiatrist, primary care doctors, therapists, social workers and others on site to meet everyone\u2019s needs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the sensory room, therapists will conduct a profile of children with behavioral problems to see if the behavior is tied to sensory problems.\n\nIn another room, clinical therapists offer parent-child interaction therapy. The parent and child in one room, a wall covered in double-sided glass, interact together while a therapist observing from behind a glass wall doles out advice and instructions in the parent\u2019s earpiece. The therapy is targeted toward children with \u201cextreme behavior\u201d such as yelling, hitting and throwing toys.\n\nThe center also includes a clinical room, counseling rooms with large leather couches and even a large youth center down the hallway with a pool table, air hockey, full kitchen and a Wii.\n\nThe Health and Wellness Center accepts MediCal, Obamacare and private insurance. If a patient does not have insurance, they charge a $50 fee, Mitchell said. Currently, the new center will only offer primary care services to those 21 and under, but they hope to expand the medical services to adults soon. The behavioral and occupational therapy services are available for children and adults.\n\nHardy said he feels the creation of the center is a moral thing.\n\n\u201cThis is something we have to do,\u201d he said. \u201cHow we treat our people when they\u2019re sick is a measure of what kind of society we are.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Two local health care programs have teamed up to offer at-risk and low-income residents integrated behavioral and medical health services at a single health center in Harbor Gateway.A grand opening ceremony was held Wednesday for the Torrance H", "title": "Harbor Gateway health clinic will offer behavioral, medical services to low-income, at-risk residents", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailybreeze.com/business/20140611/harbor-gateway-health-clinic-will-offer-behavioral-medical-services-to-low-income-at-risk-residents", "image": {"width": "1500px", "identifier": "http://www.dailybreeze.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LI/20140611/NEWS/140619867/AR/0/AR-140619867.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "973px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Harbor Gateway health clinic will offer behavioral, medical services to low-income, at-risk residents"}, "twitter": {"domain": "dailybreeze.com", "description": "Two local health care programs have teamed up to offer at-risk and low-income residents integrated behavioral and medical health services at a single health center in Harbor Gateway.A grand opening ceremony was held Wednesday for the Torrance H", "title": "Harbor Gateway health clinic will offer behavioral, medical services to low-income, at-risk residents", "url": "http://www.dailybreeze.com/business/20140611/harbor-gateway-health-clinic-will-offer-behavioral-medical-services-to-low-income-at-risk-residents", "image": {"src": "http://www.dailybreeze.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LI/20140611/NEWS/140619867/AR/0/AR-140619867.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@DailyBreezeNews", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id551753330", "iphone": "id503015160", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.torrancedailybreeze"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "health care,health clinics,South Bay,Torrance, Hospital and clinic services", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "health care,health clinics,South Bay,Torrance, Hospital and clinic services"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf5bd\"", "article_summary": "(Robert Casillas /Staff Photographer)Two local health care programs have teamed up to offer at-risk and low-income residents integrated behavioral and medical health services at a single health center in Harbor Gateway.\nCurrently, the new center will only offer primary care services to those 21 and under, but they hope to expand the medical services to adults soon.\nBut staff members were concerned that their patients might not be getting their primary health care needs met.\nHardy and others said the center is located in an area in dire need of comprehensive health services.\nThe behavioral and occupational therapy services are available for children and adults."}
