Lamar Smith (R-Texas), chairman of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee, in a statement. \u201cThe study could be used to expand EPA\u2019s control far beyond interstate waters, stripping away the power of states and allowing the EPA to regulate virtually every mud puddle in America. The EPA should slow down, and allow a full and fair review of the study in context by the public and independent scientists.\u201d\n\nSmith added that his committee will \u201cclosely evaluate\u201d the report to make sure it was guided by \u201cindependent, objective and transparent\u201d science.\n\nA new regulatory effort would not be the EPA\u2019s first attempt. The agency and the Army Corps of Engineers have previously prepared guidance on which waters were covered by the federal law, but that effort had languished under review at the White House since 2011.\n\nSen.
