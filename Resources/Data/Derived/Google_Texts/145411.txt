GREENVILLE, S.C. (AP) â€” Ted Cruz says that when it comes to immigration, he has never supported granting "amnesty" or "legalization" to people in the United States illegally.

He's half right.

Cruz once advised a White House working group that crafted President George W. Bush's ultimately unsuccessful 2004 immigration overhaul. That sought to offer temporary work visas to millions of people in the country illegally.

He also was Texas state chairman of a Hispanic organization that advocated for Bush's proposal.

And, as senator in 2013, Cruz sought to amend Marco Rubio's sweeping immigration overhaul. He opposed the possibility of citizenship, but not legalization for people here illegally

The issue proved thorny for Cruz in past Republican debates. It could again when the candidates square off Saturday in Greenville, with the South Carolina primary looming.
