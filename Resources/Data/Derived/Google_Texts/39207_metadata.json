The forecast\u2019s survey found 46 percent of employers plan to hire temporary or contract workers in 2015, up from 42 percent in last year\u2019s survey.\n\nIn addition, 56 percent of employers hiring temporary workers plan to transition some into full-time, permanent employees.\n\nThe survey also found that 36 percent of employers plan to add full-time, permanent headcount in 2015, up significantly from 24 percent who planned to hire in 2014 and the best outlook from the survey since 2006. Nine percent plan to decrease staff levels \u2014 down from 13 percent last year \u2014 while 48 percent anticipate no change and 8 percent are unsure of plans.\n\n\u201cHiring in 2014 has been broad-based, including encouraging activity among small businesses and hard-hit sectors like manufacturing and construction,\u201d said Matt Ferguson, CEO of CareerBuilder. \u201cThe amount of companies planning to hire in 2015 is up 12 percentage points over last year, setting the stage for a more competitive environment for recruiters that may lend itself to some movement in wages.\u201d\n\nAccording to the survey, hiring for science, technology, engineering and math occupations will continue to be strong with 31 percent of hiring managers planning to create jobs in these areas over the next 12 months, up from 26 percent last year.\n\nThe top five areas cited for hiring cited by hiring managers include:\n\nSales: 36 percent Customer service: 33 percent Information technology: 26 percent Production: 26 percent Administrative: 22 percent\n\nCompanies also expect to add more headcount in emerging fields. Examples include:\n\nCloud, mobile or search technology\n\nCyber security\n\nManaging and interpreting big data\n\nAlternative energy sources\n\nAnti-terrorism\n\nRobotics\n\nThe survey found five trends to watch in 2015 include:\n\nMinimum wage increasing: Forty-five percent of employers expect to raise the minimum wage within their organizations in 2015. Of these employers, 53 percent will raise it by $2 or more per hour while 32 percent will raise it by $3 or more. Forty-seven percent will limit the increase to $1 or less. The majority of employers, 69 percent said they will pay $10 or more per hour, 39 percent will pay $12 or more and 18 percent will pay $15 or more. Small businesses ramping up: Twenty-nine percent of small businesses with 250 or fewer employees expect to add full-time, permanent employees, up from 22 percent last year. Seven percent will downsize, an improvement from 9 percent last year. Education requirements becoming stricter: Twenty-eight percent of companies say they\u2019re now hiring workers with master\u2019s degrees for positions that had been primarily held by workers with four-year degrees. Thirty-seven percent are now hiring workers with college degrees for those that had been primarily held by workers with high school diplomas, 65 percent of these employers attributed this to the skills required for positions evolving within their firms. Part-time jobs increasing: Twenty-three percent of employers expect to recruit part-time works over the next 12 months, up six percentage points over last year. While various factors will influence this trend, 14 percent of all employers stated they will likely hire more part-time workers in 2015 due to the Affordable Care Act. Cubicle walls coming down: Thirteen percent of employers reported that their companies are implementing an open space floor plan with no cubicle walls in 2015.\n\nThe survey was conducted online within the US by Harris Interactive on behalf of CareerBuilder among 2,192 hiring managers and human resource professionals.
