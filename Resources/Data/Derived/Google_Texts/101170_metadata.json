It concludes that 36 out of the 48 parks have unhealthy air at times, with the 12 parks most harmed by air pollution all having unhealthy air at times and regularly blanketed by haze that reduces the visible scenery. On average, park visitors can\u2019t see 50 miles of scenery\u2014the length of Rhode Island\u2014due to haze pollution. Each of the 12 parks earned grades of \u201cD\u201d or worse in at least one category.\n\nSequoia National Park and Kings Canyon National Park tied for the title of \u201cmost harmed park\u201d with failing grades for healthy air and Ds for visibility and changing climate. Everglades National Park in Florida came in second, followed by Joshua Tree National Park in California, and Carlsbad Caverns National Park in New Mexico.\n\nFour parks\u2014Joshua Tree, Sequoia, Kings Canyon and Yosemite\u2014regularly have air that is known to be unhealthy for park visitors and rangers, sometimes for as long as a month or more each year, usually during the summer when the number of visitors and vacationers peak. Job listings for Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks, including indoor positions, warn that the parks \u201cmay pose human health problems due to air pollution.\u201d\n\nThe National Park Service recommends that park goers check the air quality of any national parks they plan to visit by consulting Airnow.gov, using the NPS website and looking up air quality in nearby zip codes. Some of the parks, such as Rocky Mountain, Sequoia and Kings Canyon, also send out alerts and advisories on social media.\n\nThe parks do play an important role in preserving the environment. The National Park Service and the United States Geological Survey say that national parks in the lower 48 states absorb carbon dioxide emissions equal to 3.1 million passenger cars annually, a pollution reduction equivalent to removing all the cars from Oregon, Kansas and West Virginia.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Your summer getaway to a national park might not be quite the pristine nature vacation", "title": "Summer Travel Alert: 12 Most Polluted National Parks", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/03/Summer-Travel-Alert-12-Most-Polluted-National-Parks", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Shenandoah-pollution.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/03/Summer-Travel-Alert-12-Most-Polluted-National-Parks", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Shenandoah-pollution.jpg", "creator": "@SuelainMoy", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Your summer getaway to a national park might not be quite the pristine nature vacation", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd18bf\"", "article_summary": "Everglades National Park in Florida came in second, followed by Joshua Tree National Park in California, and Carlsbad Caverns National Park in New Mexico.\nYour summer getaway to a national park might not be quite the pristine nature vacation you had in mind.\nSequoia National Park and Kings Canyon National Park tied for the title of \u201cmost harmed park\u201d with failing grades for healthy air and Ds for visibility and changing climate.\nIt concludes that 36 out of the 48 parks have unhealthy air at times, with the 12 parks most harmed by air pollution all having unhealthy air at times and regularly blanketed by haze that reduces the visible scenery.\nA recently issued report from the National Parks Conservation Association finds that polluted air \u201chas found its way to the highest peaks and most remote corners of the National Park System, from Everglades and Acadia to Joshua Tree and Denali.\u201dRelated: Five Ways Road-tripping Families Can Save MoneyThe report, \u201cPolluted Parks: How Dirty Air Is Harming America\u2019s National Parks,\u201d examined 48 national parks across three categories: ozone levels, haziness and the impacts of climate change."}
