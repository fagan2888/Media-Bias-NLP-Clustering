Urgent care centers stock all of the common antibiotics, and most will be able to fill a prescription for the patient before he or she leaves the appointment.\n\n\n\nShort-Term Pain Medications : If a patient goes into an urgent care clinic with an injury such as a slipped disk or severe back pain, some urgent care clinics will be able to prescribe short-term pain medications. However, not all urgent care centers are allowed to prescribe pain medications, and there are some that will prescribe based on the patient\u2019s condition.\n\n\n\nOne-Time Maintenance Medications : For patients in need of a maintenance medication because they ran out of refills, the urgent care clinic will most likely not provide them with a full refill, but can give the patient a one-time dose until he or she is able to get in touch with a doctor for a refill on that medication. Certain one-time medications available include cholesterol medications, blood pressure medications, and medications to treat diabetes.\n\n\n\nAsthma and Allergy Medications : For patients visiting an urgent care clinic for allergies or asthma, the physician will be able to prescribe appropriate medications. Long-term allergy medication recommendations can also be made.\n\n\n\nAntiviral Medication : Antiviral medications, such as those to treat the flu, are available at urgent care clinics. Patients who think they have the flu should get checked out as soon as possible in order for the antiviral medication to work properly.\n\n\n\nMedications for Stomach Conditions : Patients who suffer with stomach issues, such as constipation or acid reflux, may be able to go to an urgent care clinic for a short-term medication for 30 days or less until they are able to see their primary physician or a gastrointestinal specialist.\n\nOne of the many great conveniences of urgent care clinics is that many have their own pharmacy, which eliminates the patient\u2019s need to go to another location after a visit. Urgent care clinics also accept most insurance plans, which provides flexible, and affordable prescriptions.Doctors that work at these urgent care clinics are able to prescribe medications just as a primary care physician would.
