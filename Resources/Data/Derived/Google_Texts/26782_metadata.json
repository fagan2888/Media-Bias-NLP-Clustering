During the day, she drives a bus for Madison County Transit while her son, Cody Pointer, attends the William Bedell Achievement and Resource Center in Wood River. When she returns from work, she diligently assists in his needs. Pointer is fed through a tube and is allergic to both soy and milk. Because of this, Thrasher feeds him an amino-based diet. That diet costs upwards of $3,000 a month, and is nearly impossible to maintain with state-funded Medicaid.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to keep him living with us, but the state is making it too difficult,\u201d Thrasher said.\n\nThe most recent problem came with a bout of acid reflux. Due to the feeding tube situation, Pointer has battles with several ailments, such as acid reflux. Thrasher said doctors advised crushing over-the-counter antacids for Pointer\u2019s reflux, which Thrasher said would not suffice. She said her son required Omeprazole, a prescription antacid, which would cost as much as $271 a month.\n\nLuckily, Thrasher said she was awarded a coupon from a nurse to lower the cost to just below $80 a month.\n\n\u201cThe pharmacist said the state only pays $9 per month,\u201d Thrasher said. \u201cMy son is currently suffering because of $9. The state is not paying these people.\u201d\n\nState payments may also be behind Thrasher\u2019s inability to find a long-term personal physician. She said many physicians are not aware of her son\u2019s condition and have no idea how to go about treatment. She said, because of the state\u2019s inability to pay Medicaid, Pointer has not gotten the care he requires to thrive.\n\n\u201cOne time I was dropped by a physician with only three days worth of milk for him and no prescription,\u201d Thrasher said. \u201cLast year, when they all dropped me, I said, \u2018OK, I\u2019ll get new doctors.\u2019 The doctors were not getting paid, so they\u2019re going to quit.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cmilk\u201d described by Thrasher is a specially-concocted formula for those who cannot feed themselves and have difficulties processing lactose and soy. That milk is the majority of the $3,000-a-month diet Pointer requires. Thrasher said she is not sure how she may receive her next supply of milk. Many of the medical supply distributors providing the special milk are going out of business due to lack of state funding.\n\n\u201cEvery time I call them, I expect to be dropped,\u201d Thrasher said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be shocked or surprised.\u201d\n\nThrasher once attempted to supplement Pointer\u2019s Medicaid with her own insurance through her employer. Due to federal law and the Affordable Care Act, or as it is commonly called, \u201cObamacare,\u201d she was unable to add another insurance plan to Pointer\u2019s Medicaid, despite her assertion it could no longer suffice.\n\nCurrently, Thrasher is reconsidering her where she resides and her son\u2019s residence. She said she has cared for him, fed him and changed his diapers for 21 years, but may have to leave those responsibilities to someone else if her current woes continue.\n\n\u201cI am thinking about setting down my keys, foreclosing on my house and leaving here,\u201d she said.\n\nWhere would Thrasher go? Well, like more than 100,000 other people, Thrasher is considering leaving Illinois. She has a daughter and son-in-law in Ohio, and found an affordable apartment she could rent in Fort Wayne, Indiana. With an Indiana address, Pointer would be eligible for a group home in that state.\n\n\u201cIf he\u2019s in a group home, they would be required by law to make sure he gets the milk he needs,\u201d Thrasher said.\n\nBecause she could not bear to have her son alone in another state, Thrasher said she would be forced to leave her job and her home to live with him. If she stays under the current financial climate, however, Thrasher is worried for the health of her son, as well as her own.\n\n\u201cOne day, I had to stop the bus because my jaw was tightening, and my chest hurt,\u201d Thrasher recalled. \u201cI thought I was having a heart attack because of all the stress this is putting me through.\u201d\n\nOnce she arrived at the doctor, she was told she had a dangerously-high resting pulse of 97 beats per minute. She attributed her health episode to her current predicament in caring for her son.\n\nThis scenario isn\u2019t new for Thrasher, however, she said the state has been less-than-upstanding with her son\u2019s situation for the past eight years. When asked what the state could do to help her situation, Thrasher thrust her arms toward the sky with a frustrated smile and said simply: \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nReach reporter Cory Davenport at 618-208-6447.\n\nThrasher is struggling to ensure her mentally and physically disabled son can thrive despite the state\u2019s budget impasse\n\nBy Cory Davenport [email protected]\n\nSingle mother Julie Thrasher embracing her son, Cody Pointer, who suffers from mental and physical delay.
