It\u2019s time to do something about it.\n\nAdvertisement - story continues below\n\nWe recently celebrated Independence Day. From that initial struggle against the British to the present day, we have honored our military veterans for their courageous sacrifice in helping keep us free.\n\nSadly, many of these veterans have recently seen their courage \u201crewarded\u201d with a gun ban. And this concerns all gun owners, because what is happening to our veterans through the Veteran\u2019s Administration can happen to you someday through ObamaCare.\n\nBut the problem with military veterans is not new. For nearly twenty years, Gun Owners of America has been keeping you informed about the anti-gun atrocities being performed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the Justice Department against law-abiding veterans.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nThe idea was first hatched during the Bill Clinton administration. And it works like this:\n\nWhen a veteran, as a result of a traumatic experience abroad, seeks disability benefits and/or counseling, the VA moves to appoint a guardian to manage that veteran\u2019s financial affairs.\n\nUnder illegitimate Bill Clinton interpretations by the ATF, this \u201cinability to handle his (or her) financial affairs\u201d would make the veteran \u201cmentally defective\u201d under 18 U.S.C. 922 (g) (4), and hence legally barred from owning a gun or ammunition.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nUnfortunately, another so-called pro-gun group worked with anti-gun Senator Chuck Schumer in 2007 and 2008 to pass the Veterans Disarmament Act, which codified these unlawful actions into statutory law.\n\nWND.com reported recently that people who live with veterans are now being ordered not to possess a gun. And get this: some veterans are being told they can \u201cbuy back\u201d their gun rights by forgoing their VA benefits!\n\nOne veteran, who is an attorney and who has studied this problem closely, said: \u201cthis is illegal and is called extortion.\u201d\n\nCurrently, there could be as many as 200,000 military veterans who have been affected by this gun ban. It\u2019s time to do something about it.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nFor specific action steps you can take to help our veterans get their guns back, visit: GunOwners.org\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by the owners of this website.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Currently, there could be as many as 200,000 military veterans who have been affected by this gun ban.
