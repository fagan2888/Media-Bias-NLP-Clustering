The others were Tiger Woods, Jack Nicklaus and Bobby Jones, three of the game\u2019s greatest players.\n\nBoy Wonder appears on his way to belonging in that group.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think in my wildest dreams I\u2019d have a summer like this,\u201d said McIlroy, only the seventh player to win the last two majors of the year. \u201cI played the best golf of my life. I really gutted it out today.\u201d\n\nBut one of the greatest shows on soggy turf came with a most peculiar ending.\n\nThree shots behind going to the back nine, McIlroy rallied to take the lead and then hit a 9-iron from the fairway bunker to 10 feet for birdie on the 17th hole for a two-shot lead going to the par-5 18th. Because of a two-hour rain delay earlier, darkness was falling quickly and it wasn\u2019t certain McIlroy would be able to finish.\n\nMcIlroy was allowed to hit his tee shot before Mickelson and Rickie Fowler had reached their drives. Both were only two shots behind, still in the game. McIlroy came within a yard of hitting in a hazard right of the fairway.\n\nThen, the PGA of America allowed McIlroy to hit his second shot. Mickelson and Fowler had to stand to the side of the green.\n\n\u201cWe were cool with hitting the tee shot,\u201d Fowler said. \u201cWe weren\u2019t expecting the approach shots.\u201d\n\nFowler had a 50-foot eagle attempt to tie for the lead. He was well off the mark, and missed the short birdie putt attempt that cost him his third straight runner-up finish in a major. Mickelson was short of the green, and his chip came within inches of dropping for an eagle that would have tied him for the lead.\n\nMickelson appeared upset that they had to wait to finish the hole \u2014 not standard procedure in a PGA Tour event \u2014 and he made two references in a TV interview that this is the only championship the PGA of America runs all year.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t affect the outcome of the championship at all, I don\u2019t think,\u201d Mickelson said. \u201cIt\u2019s not what we normally do. It\u2019s not a big deal either way.\u201d\n\nMickelson closed with a 66 and was runner-up for the ninth time in a major.\n\nFowler became the first player in history to finish in the top five at all four majors without winning one. He closed with a 68 and tied for third with Henrik Stenson, who fell out of a share of the lead by missing a 3-foot par putt on the 14th hole. Stenson shot a 66.\n\nMcIlroy hit his second shot into a bunker, and he had to two-putt from 35 feet for the win. He lagged the first one to tap-in range, and the major was his. McIlroy repeatedly pumped his fist before letting out a scream above the gallery that had been treated to one of the best shows ever in a major.\n\nHe won his first two majors by eight shots at the 2011 U.S. Open and 2012 PGA Championship. Only a month ago, McIlroy took a six-shot lead into the final round of the British Open and completed a wire-to-wire win with only a brief scare.\n\nThis was his first big test, and it took some of his best golf to come through.\n\n\u201cI think I showed a lot of guts out there to get the job done,\u201d he said.\n\nThe winning shot turned out to be that 9-iron from the bunker and the birdie putt on the 17th hole that gave him a two-shot lead, the largest margin for anyone on a day when as many as five players claimed a share of the lead.\n\nIt might not have been possible without a 3-wood on the par-5 10th hole.\n\nStanding in the fairway, McIlroy watched Fowler drain a 30-foot birdie putt to take the outright lead. McIlroy was 281 yards away, slightly uphill, and his short caught the left side of the fairway and rolled onto the green before stopping 7 feet away for an eagle that got him back in the game.\n\nMickelson holed a 10-foot birdie putt on the 11th hole to tie Fowler, and it looked to be his day when he rolled in a 30-foot par putt on the 12th. Stenson hit a bold shot to the island-green 13th for a short birdie to tie for the lead, only to fall back.\n\nMcIlroy caught the leaders with a birdie on the 13th.\n\nNone of the other contenders made another birdie the rest of the way until it was too late.\n\nAll that was left after an exhausting day of raw emotions was the coronation. Not since Woods in 2008 has anyone won three straight tournaments, and they were big ones for McIlroy \u2014 the British Open, a World Golf Championship and the PGA Championship. He played them in a combined 48-under par.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s better than everyone else right now,\u201d Mickelson said.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb57d\"", "article_summary": "LOUISVILLE, Ky. \u2014 The challenge finally arrived for Rory McIlroy, and he was better than ever Sunday to win the PGA Championship.\nHe was well off the mark, and missed the short birdie putt attempt that cost him his third straight runner-up finish in a major.\nMcIlroy hit his second shot into a bunker, and he had to two-putt from 35 feet for the win.\nStanding in the fairway, McIlroy watched Fowler drain a 30-foot birdie putt to take the outright lead.\nMcIlroy was allowed to hit his tee shot before Mickelson and Rickie Fowler had reached their drives."}
