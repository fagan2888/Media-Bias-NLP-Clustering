Trump, in response to a question on why people should vote for him instead of Carson, said, “Because I will make the best trade deals, I will be strongest and best on the military. I will get rid of Obamacare. You know, Ben wants to knock out Medicare. I heard that over the weekend. He wants to abolish Medicare. And I think abolishing Medicare, I don’t think you’re going to get away with that one. And it’s actually a program that’s worked. So, it’s a program that some people love, actually. So, if you look at what’s going on with our country, if you take a look at the horrible deals that we’ve made, including the Iran deal, including, even you take a look on a different subject, Sergeant Bergdahl. We get Bergdahl, they get five of the killers that they’ve wanted for a long period of time. I mean, you know, it’s — the whole thing is ridiculous. And that’s why people are just so unhappy. I will make some of the great trade deals. I will bring our jobs back. I’ll bring our money back. I’ll bring our manufacturing back. Ben cannot do that.”
