Do you think that he could be the nominee? If he were the nominee, would you be comfortable supporting him?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll support the Democratic nominee whoever it is,\u201d Feingold responded. \u201cI\u2019ve worked with Bernie Sanders. He\u2019s an honorable person, he is a committed progressive and I agree with him on many issues.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn fact, Bernie and I were holding out for an even stronger bill on the Affordable Care Act,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe wanted a single-payer \u2013 we wanted an option to opt in, a public option.\u201d\n\nAfter the slip-up, Roll Call asked a Feingold spokesman if the Democratic candidate supports a single-payer approach.\n\n\u201cThere can be an honest debate about how to achieve\u201d universal coverage, spokesman Michael Tyler answered. He added that if Feingold were to win the election, he does not plan to push for single-payer health care.\n\n\u201cRight now, Russ is focused on increasing access to health care through the framework of the ACA,\u201d Tyler said.\n\nDespite Feingold\u2019s abrupt backtrack during the event, the former Wisconsin senator, who spent 18 years in Washington, called for a single-payer health care system as far back as 1992 and as recently as 2009, when he said the \u201cultimate goal\u201d of health care is to eventual lead to a system that looks like single-payer.\n\nAmelia Chass\u00e9, press secretary for America Rising PAC, said that Feingold is so desperate to get back to Washington that he\u2019ll abandon his positions to win the election and deceive the people of Wisconsin.\n\n\u201cFormer Senator Feingold\u2019s desperation to get back to Washington, D.C. has reached a new low \u2013 not only will he flip flop on his fundraising pledges; he\u2019s now showing he will abandon his policy principles in his craven bid to win his old senate seat.\u201d said Chass\u00e9.\n\n\u201cSenator Feingold\u2019s cynical attempt to deceive Wisconsin voters about his long-held support for an extreme Canadian-style health care plan is proof of political ambition run amok.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Russ Feingold said that as talks of the Affordable Care Act were underway, he and Bernie Sanders were holding off for an even stronger bill.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "Wisconsin Democratic Senate candidate Russ Feingold appeared at Marquette Law School recently and said that as talks of the Affordable Care Act were underway, he and Bernie Sanders were holding off fo", "title": "Russ Feingold Abruptly Stops Himself From Saying He Supports Single-Payer Health Care", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/politics/russ-feingold-abruptly-stops-himself-from-saying-he-supports-single-payer-health-care/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Russ-Feingold-150x150.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Wisconsin Democratic Senate candidate Russ Feingold appeared at Marquette Law School recently and sa", "creator": "@JoeSchoffstall", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Russ-Feingold-150x150.jpg", "title": "Russ Feingold Abruptly Stops Himself From Saying He Supports Single-Payer Health Care", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID", "pages": 282024895179874}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "He added that if Feingold were to win the election, he does not plan to push for single-payer health care.\n\u201cRight now, Russ is focused on increasing access to health care through the framework of the ACA,\u201d Tyler said.\n\u201cSenator Feingold\u2019s cynical attempt to deceive Wisconsin voters about his long-held support for an extreme Canadian-style health care plan is proof of political ambition run amok.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve worked with Bernie Sanders.\nIf he were the nominee, would you be comfortable supporting him?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll support the Democratic nominee whoever it is,\u201d Feingold responded."}
