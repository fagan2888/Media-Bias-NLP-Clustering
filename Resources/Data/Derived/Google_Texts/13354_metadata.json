Had nothing to do with fundraising #AlsoPSUReadingComprehensionAppearsToBeWeak.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt this rate your diploma won\u2019t be recognized, Moron,\u201d he said in a tweet to @dave_seidel.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t make [expletive] up, Sonny. You\u2019ll wind up running Penn State,\u201d he said in a tweet to @EricOwensFS.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to thank the students and alums of Penn State for proving my point about the mediocrity of their education and ethics,\u201d Mr. Olbermann said in a general tweet to his 537,000 followers.\n\nOn Tuesday, ESPN said in a statement that \u201cit was completely inappropriate and does not reflect the views of ESPN. We have discussed it with Keith, who recognizes he was wrong. ESPN and Keith have agreed that he will not host his show for the remainder of this week and will return on Monday. The annual tradition of THON and the efforts of the students of Penn State to fight pediatric cancer should be applauded.\u201d\n\nMr. Olbermann also apologized on Twitter, saying, \u201cI was stupid and childish and way less mature than the students there who did such a great fundraising job.\u201d\n\nAll of Mr. Olbermann\u2019s insulting tweets remained on his page as of Tuesday afternoon.", "article_metadata": {"description": "ESPN has suspended Keith Olbermann for the rest of the week after he went on a Twitter rant against Penn State students.", "Author": "Jessica Chasmar", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "ESPN has suspended Keith Olbermann for the rest of the week after he went on a Twitter rant against Penn State students.", "title": "Keith Olbermann suspended by ESPN after Twitter rant against Penn State students", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/feb/24/keith-olbermann-suspended-by-espn-after-twitter-ra/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2012/04/08/20120408-161618-pic-272355613.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2012/04/08/20120408-161618-pic-272355613.jpg", "title": "Keith Olbermann suspended by ESPN after Twitter rant against Penn Stat", "description": "ESPN has suspended Keith Olbermann for the rest of the week after he went on a Twitter rant against Penn State students.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Entertainment Culture, Education, Keith Olbermann, Twitter, Espn"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb2af\"", "article_summary": "ESPN has suspended Keith Olbermann for the rest of the week after he went on a Twitter rant against Penn State students.\nHe then went on a long rant against his Twitter critics, calling Penn State students \u201cmorons,\u201d \u201cgoobers\u201d and saying their degrees are worthless.\nYou\u2019ll wind up running Penn State,\u201d he said in a tweet to @EricOwensFS.\nOn Monday, a Penn State alum tweeted to Mr. Olbermann the phrase \u201cWe Are!\u201d and a link to an article about students raising more than $13 million to fight pediatric cancer.\n\u201cNo, Son,\u201d Mr. Olbermann said to one critic."}
