Detecting an \u201coverwhelming smell of raw marijuana,\u201d officers spent hours searching the vehicle and found no contraband.\n\nBut they did discover an empty secret compartment.\n\nFor that, police hauled Gurley, who has no criminal record, off to jail. Gurley became the first person arrested under a new Ohio statute that makes it a crime to \u201cknowingly operate \u2026 a vehicle with a hidden compartment \u2026 used or intended to be used to facilitate the unlawful concealment \u2026 of a controlled substance.\u201d\n\nLawmakers in Ohio are not alone in enacting or envisioning bans on unauthorized empty space. California, Georgia, Illinois, and Oregon have similar prohibitions on the books. Legislators in Iowa, Maryland, and New Jersey may add them this session. Similar bills have been filed in Delaware, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Virginia in recent years.\n\nGurley\u2019s arrest struck more than a few people as an abuse of power. George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley calls the incident \u201cpart of the expanding criminalization of America where virtually any act can be charged as a crime by police.\u201d\n\nIn drug cases, hidden compartment laws give prosecutors one more charge to pile onto the same offense\u2014beyond traditional counts like possession and intent to distribute. \u201cSuch proliferation of counts allows prosecutors to force people to plead guilty to avoid long potential sentences,\u201d writes Turley, on his blog.\n\nAs Gurley\u2019s case shows, however, motorists risk criminal charges independent of any other illicit activity. (Though police eventually did find a misdemeanor amount of marijuana in the pocket of Gurley\u2019s passenger, the discovery took place after both of them had already been arrested, according to Reason\u2019s Ken Silva. \"Without the hidden compartment law, we would not have had any charges on [Gurley],\" a state trooper told the local news station.)\n\nIn addition to fines and prison time, Illinois law and New Jersey\u2019s bill threaten another penalty: civil asset forfeiture. (Two bills killed in the Virginia General Assembly this year would have as well.)\n\nWith civil forfeiture, police are under no obligation return a seized vehicle if prosecutors decide not to proceed with a criminal case or if the jury decides to acquit. Once police take a vehicle, property owners generally must file a lawsuit to get it back.\n\nPolice and prosecutors naturally like this arrangement; they usually get to keep seized vehicles or the profits from auctioning them off. But the process is a nightmare for property owners, who are considered guilty until proven innocent.\n\nHidden compartment laws contain scant protections for law-abiding folk, who may have perfectly legitimate reasons to conceal valuables in a secret compartment. Maybe you park in a high-crime area. Perhaps you carry large amounts of cash for your church or small business. Or, from personal experience, maybe you go for a hike and don\u2019t want to risk losing your keys or wallet in the wilderness, but the plastic roof of your friend\u2019s Wrangler is easily penetrated.\n\nUsed-car owners could also be at risk. If police discover a secret nook you didn\u2019t know about, you\u2019re looking at arrest, at the very least. (Interestingly, Iowa\u2019s bill shields car dealers, but not car purchasers, from prosecution.)\n\nBack in Ohio, because Norman Gurley was driving a friend\u2019s car, the grand jury may not have been convinced that he both had knowledge of the hidden compartment and that he intended to use it for nefarious purposes at some point in the future.\n\nBy now, the grand jurors should have decided whether the state has enough evidence to put Gurley on trial. But Gurley\u2019s attorney and the Lorain County prosecutor\u2019s office did not return phone calls requesting comment, and the public docket at the county\u2019s Court of Common Pleas is mum on the question of an indictment.\n\nRegardless, the man has spent several months contemplating prison time\u2014and likely has some legal bills to boot. As police like to say, you can beat the rap, but you can\u2019t beat the ride.\n\nAnd in Illinois and New Jersey, they might take your ride.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "In drug cases, hidden compartment laws give prosecutors one more charge to pile onto the same offense, and contain scant protections for law-abiding folk.", "title": "The 'Crime' of Having a Hidden Compartment in Your Car", "url": "http://reason.com/archives/2014/02/16/the-crime-of-having-a-hidden-compartment", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/mc/_external/2014_02/hidden-compartment.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Last fall, Ohio state troopers pulled 30-year-old\nNorman Gurley over for speeding.
