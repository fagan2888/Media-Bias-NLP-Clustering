Charles E. Grassley on Wednesday.\n\nPHOTOS: U.S. Open 2015: PGA Tour WAGs\n\nThe IRS\u2019s chief lawyer had reached that conclusion in 2000, and the agency has newly confirmed it, Mr. Koskinen said.\n\nMr. Grassley called that a mockery of the law and said he will try to write a bill specifically prohibiting it.\n\n\u201cThe tax code shouldn\u2019t reward those who broke our immigration laws,\u201d the Iowa Republican and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee said in a statement.\n\nPHOTOS: Top earning dead celebrities\n\nThe tax issue has become one of several flash points over Mr. Obama\u2019s deportation amnesty, which grants tentative legal status, Social Security numbers and work permits to illegal immigrants who qualify. The newly legalized workers would also likely be eligible for driver\u2019s licenses, and could even be more attractive than native-born workers to some employers trying to figure out ways to save money under Obamacare mandates.\n\nMr. Koskinen has previously said that illegal immigrants must be able to prove they worked off-the-books in order to claim the EITC, and it\u2019s unclear how many of the population Mr. Obama is aiming to cover would be able to offer such proof.\n\nThe three-year time frame is part of general tax law, allowing anyone who didn\u2019t file to go back and claim a refund for up to three previous year\u2019s worth of taxes.\n\nBut the IRS lawyer\u2019s ruling creates an odd circumstance where illegal immigrants who cheated by not paying taxes before can see if they would benefit from refunds. If they do benefit, they could file, but if they don\u2019t benefit they could continue to avoid taxes for those years.\n\nMr. Obama\u2019s new amnesty program does not require payment of back taxes.\n\nCongress is currently snared in a fight over Mr. Obama\u2019s deportation amnesty, with House Republicans insisting it be ended and trying to tie continued funding for the Homeland Security Department to provisions that would halt the amnesty.\n\nDemocrats are universally opposed, and Senate Republicans, caught in the middle, have begun to side with Democrats, arguing that homeland security money must keep flowing no matter what.\n\nA federal court has put Mr. Obama\u2019s expanded amnesty on hold, finding that the president likely skirted federal law in issuing the new policy without first going through a period of public comment and review.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The IRS is defending its decision to let illegal immigrants claim up to three years' refunds on income even if they never paid income taxes, telling Congress in a new letter last week that agency lawyers have concluded getting a Social Security number triggers the ability to go back and ask for previous refunds.", "Author": "Stephen Dinan", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The IRS is defending its decision to let illegal immigrants claim up to three years\u2019 refunds on income even if they never paid income taxes, telling Congress in a new letter last week that agency lawyers have concluded getting a Social Security number triggers the ability to go back and ask for previous refunds.", "title": "IRS defends paying refunds to illegals who never filed taxes", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/mar/2/irs-defends-refunds-illegals-never-filed-taxes/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/04/11/irs.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/04/11/irs.jpg", "title": "IRS defends paying refunds to illegals who never filed taxes", "description": "The IRS is defending its decision to let illegal immigrants claim up to three years' refunds on income even if they never paid income taxes, telling Congress in a new letter last week that agency lawy", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Politics, Social Issues, Internal Revenue Service, Congress, John Koskinen"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfe5e\"", "article_summary": "But the IRS lawyer\u2019s ruling creates an odd circumstance where illegal immigrants who cheated by not paying taxes before can see if they would benefit from refunds.\nMr. Obama\u2019s new amnesty program does not require payment of back taxes.\nIf they do benefit, they could file, but if they don\u2019t benefit they could continue to avoid taxes for those years.\nA federal court has put Mr. Obama\u2019s expanded amnesty on hold, finding that the president likely skirted federal law in issuing the new policy without first going through a period of public comment and review.\nMr. Grassley called that a mockery of the law and said he will try to write a bill specifically prohibiting it."}
