Atlas and John F. Cogan, both senior fellows at the Stanford University's Hoover Institution, argue that the ACA has led to rising health insurance premiums, fewer provider choices for consumers and industry consolidation that is likely to drive up costs. But there are ways to combat these trends, they write.\n\nRecent research from Carnegie Mellon University, for instance, has shown that high-deductible plans can lower healthcare spending without later increasing visits to the emergency department or hospitalizations. Such plans allow insurance coverage to fulfill its core purpose of protecting individuals from the risk of major, unplanned medical expenses, according to Atlas and Cogan.\n\nHSAs, meanwhile, allow consumers to put aside tax-free money in an individually owned account to pay for treatment and services. Because they require consumers to pay for care themselves, HSAs can encourage individuals to be selective about their healthcare spending choices and push providers for price transparency. In fact, the same Carnegie Mellon study found that a combination of high-deductible plans and HSAs can reduce healthcare spending by 15 percent every year, the article notes.\n\nIn order to encourage the use of these two key elements for an ACA fix, the government should raise the maximum allowable contribution for HSAs and expand the breadth of services and products that consumers can purchase with them, Atlas and Cogan write. Further, the government should eliminate the ACA's restrictions on high-deductible plans and regulations regarding who can open an HSA account.\n\nPerhaps \"one of the most realistic changes\" to the ACA, however, could come from a repeal of the law's planned expansion of the small-group market, FierceHealthPayer has reported.\n\nRepublican candidates also have their own ideas, such as Scott Walker's plan to extend refundable tax credits to help individuals pay for private health insurance based on their age, or Donald Trump's idea to sell insurance plans across state lines.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the opinion piece\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nSmall-group market rules change may be GOP's best chance to alter ACA\n\nNo shortage of GOP alternatives to ACA, but no consensus either\n\nHow Republican presidential candidates plan to replace the ACA\n\nThe trouble with letting insurers sell plans across state lines", "article_metadata": {"description": "Now that repairing or replacing the Affordable Care Act has become a \"realistic possibility,\" any new plan to fix the healthcare system should feature two key elements: High-deductible plans and health savings accounts, according to an\u00a0opinion piece\u00a0published by the\u00a0Wall Street Journal.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthPayer", "description": "Now that repairing or replacing the Affordable Care Act has become a \"realistic possibility,\" any new plan to fix the healthcare system should feature two key elements: High-deductible plans and health savings accounts, according to an\u00a0opinion piece\u00a0published by the\u00a0Wall Street Journal.", "title": "High-deductible plans, health savings accounts could repair the ACA", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthpayer.com/story/high-deductible-plans-health-savings-accounts-could-repair-aca/2015-09-02", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthpayer.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "healthpayer", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "keywords": "ACA repeal,Affordable Care Act,Financial Management,health savings accounts,high-deductible plans,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,Operations & Business Management", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Financial Management,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,Operations & Business Management"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8101\"", "article_summary": "Further, the government should eliminate the ACA's restrictions on high-deductible plans and regulations regarding who can open an HSA account.\nRecent research from Carnegie Mellon University, for instance, has shown that high-deductible plans can lower healthcare spending without later increasing visits to the emergency department or hospitalizations.\nIn fact, the same Carnegie Mellon study found that a combination of high-deductible plans and HSAs can reduce healthcare spending by 15 percent every year, the article notes.\nNow that repairing or replacing the Affordable Care Act has become a \"realistic possibility,\" any new plan to fix the healthcare system should feature two key elements: High-deductible plans and health savings accounts (HSAs), according to an opinion piece published by the Wall Street Journal.\nSuch plans allow insurance coverage to fulfill its core purpose of protecting individuals from the risk of major, unplanned medical expenses, according to Atlas and Cogan."}
