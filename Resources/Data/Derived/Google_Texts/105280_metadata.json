(Craig Lassig/Reuters)\n\nResponding to what she called a \u201cquiet epidemic\u201d of heroin and prescription opiate abuse, Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton proposed a $10 billion plan Wednesday to treat addicts and curb incarceration for nonviolent drug offenses.\n\nThe program, much of which would be funded by the federal government, would also help get a life-saving rescue drug into the hands of more emergency responders to improve the odds for overdose victims.\n\nThe plan, announced in an op-ed in the Manchester, N.H., Union Leader newspaper, grew out of months of discussion of national drug addiction at Clinton campaign events in New Hampshire, Iowa and elsewhere. The topic comes up nearly every time Clinton engages voters in public, and she has made the scourge of drug addiction a part of her stump speech.\n\nIn the op-ed, Clinton recounted her discussion with a retired doctor in New Hampshire in April, just after she entered the 2016 race.\n\n\u201cHe said his biggest worry was the rising tide of heroin addiction in the state, following a wave of prescription drug abuse,\u201d Clinton wrote. \u201cTo be candid, I didn\u2019t expect what came next. In state after state, this issue came up again and again \u2014 from so many people, from all walks of life, in small towns and big cities.\u201d\n\n[Presidential candidates are actually talking about America\u2019s heroin issue]\n\nHer proposal would widen access to treatment and recovery programs, chiefly through a new $7.5 billion federal-state spending package. States that meet new federal tests for treatment and other resources would get $4 from the federal government for every $1 spent.\n\nPart of that cost would be offset, Clinton\u2019s campaign maintains, by reduced costs in the prison and criminal justice systems if fewer low-level drug offenders were behind bars.\n\nClinton cited statistics showing that only 10 percent of the 23 million addicted Americans are getting treatment, and that in 2013, more Americans died from overdoses than car crashes.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, deaths involving heroin increased from 3,041 in 2008 to 8,260 in 2013, the latest statistics available.\n\n\u201cThis is not new. We\u2019re not just now 'discovering' this problem,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBut we should be saying enough is enough. It\u2019s time we recognize as a nation that for too long, we have had a quiet epidemic on our hands.\u201d\n\nPeople with addiction have found that treatment facilities are full and insurance companies won't cover the cost. The Affordable Care Act mandates that insurance plans make substance abuse and mental health treatment essential benefits, but treatment is often hard to come by and barriers to accessing it remain.\n\nAlso Wednesday, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican presidential contender, released a new television ad casting treatment for drug addiction as a \u201cpro-life\u201d issue.\n\n\u201cFor those whose lives we have a chance to save, I want us to try to save those lives,\u201d Christie says in the ad. \u201cBecause I believe every one of those lives is a precious gift from God.\u201d\n\nKatie Zezima contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Democratic presidential front-runner is proposing a $10 billion plan to treat addicts and curb incarceration for nonviolent drug offenses.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/anne.gearan", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The Democratic presidential front-runner is proposing a $10 billion plan to treat addicts and curb incarceration for nonviolent drug offenses.", "title": "Hillary Clinton\u2019s $10 billion plan for treating drug addiction", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/09/02/hillary-clintons-10-billion-plan-for-treating-drug-addiction/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2015-09-01/AP/Health_Overhaul_New_Tax-06f4c.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@agearan"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/09/02/hillary-clintons-10-billion-plan-for-treating-drug-addiction/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "clinton drug treatment, hillary clinton", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/anne.gearan"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "clinton drug treatment, hillary clinton"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd200e\"", "article_summary": "Chris Christie, a Republican presidential contender, released a new television ad casting treatment for drug addiction as a \u201cpro-life\u201d issue.\nDemocratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton addresses the Democratic National Committee (DNC) Summer Meeting in Minneapolis, Minn., on Aug. 28.\nThe plan, announced in an op-ed in the Manchester, N.H., Union Leader newspaper, grew out of months of discussion of national drug addiction at Clinton campaign events in New Hampshire, Iowa and elsewhere.\n\u201cHe said his biggest worry was the rising tide of heroin addiction in the state, following a wave of prescription drug abuse,\u201d Clinton wrote.\nThe topic comes up nearly every time Clinton engages voters in public, and she has made the scourge of drug addiction a part of her stump speech."}
