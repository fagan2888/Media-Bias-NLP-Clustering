Today is the first Memorial Day in 14 years that the United States is not engaged in a major ground war.\u201d\n\nThe administration has delayed plans to draw down U.S. forces from Afghanistan, keeping a contingent of about 9,800 troops in there until sometime next year to train Afghan forces amid continued security concerns.\n\nAnd in Iraq, Mr. Obama is resisting calls to send more troops to train and advise Iraq forces besieged by the Islamic State guerrilla army.\n\nThe president said U.S. troops are still in harm\u2019s way, in spite of the official end of America\u2019s combat role in the war in Afghanistan.\n\n\u201cThis may be the first Memorial Day since the end of our war in Afghanistan, but we are acutely aware as we speak, our men and women in uniform still stand watch, still serve and still sacrifice around the world,\u201d he said. \u201cSeveral years ago, we had more than 100,000 troops in Afghanistan. We\u2019ll continue to bring them home, and reduce our forces further down to an embassy presence by the end of next year. But Afghanistan remains a very dangerous place. As so many families know, our troops continue to risk their lives for us.\u201d\n\nDefense Secretary Ashton Carter, who introduced the president at Arlington, said nearly 200,000 U.S. service members are stationed overseas on this Memorial Day.\n\n\u201cTroops of such caliber demand great leaders, and there\u2019s no doubt they have one in our commander-in-chief,\u201d Mr. Carter said. \u201cHe cares deeply about the safety, welfare and dignity of our men and women in uniform and their families.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the president placed a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns at Arlington.\n\nHouse Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Jeff Miller, Florida Republican, also paid tribute on Memorial Day to America\u2019s service members \u201cwho gave their lives so we could live ours in peace.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey defeated fascism in Europe and imperialism in the Pacific,\u201d Mr. Miller said. \u201cThey countered communism in Korea and Vietnam. And today, they fight Islamic extremism. They have made America a beacon of hope for countless people around the world and a place we are proud to call home.\u201d\n\nGen. Martin E. Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the act of remembrance should be a yearlong devotion.\n\n\u201cAnd what of next week, and next month? What should we do then?\u201d he said. \u201cRemember. Take a moment to think of those who did not survive their wounds, who did not return home.\u201d\n\nMr. Obama said the holiday is a time to honor those Americans who have given their lives since 9/11, including more than 2,200 who died in Afghanistan. He said Arlington is \u201cis a reflection of America itself.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a reflection of our diversity \u2014 men and women of all backgrounds, all races and creeds and circumstances and faiths, willing to defend and die for the ideals that bind us as one nation,\u201d Mr. Obama said.\n\nThe president also met Monday with Gold Star families, who have lost a loved one in service to the country. He said they represent \u201cthe best of who we are.\u201d\n\n\u201cMost Americans don\u2019t fully see, don\u2019t fully understand the sacrifice made by the 1 percent who serve in this all-volunteer armed forces \u2014 a sacrifice that preserves the freedoms we too often take for granted,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cFew know what it\u2019s like to take a bullet for a buddy, or to live with the fact that he or she took one for you. But our Gold Star families, our military families, our veterans \u2014 they know this, intimately.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama used the Memorial Day holiday to remind Americans Monday that it's the first such annual observance since the 9/11 terrorist attacks that U.S. combat troops aren't fighting a major war on distant battlefields.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "President Obama used the Memorial Day holiday to remind Americans Monday that it\u2019s the first such annual observance since the 9/11 terrorist attacks that U.S. combat troops aren\u2019t fighting a major war on distant battlefields.", "title": "In Memorial Day tribute to fallen troops, Obama cites his role in ending wars", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/25/memorial-day-obama-cites-his-role-ending-wars/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/25/773ddb3259267f17770f6a70670056cc.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/25/773ddb3259267f17770f6a70670056cc.jpg", "description": "President Obama used the Memorial Day holiday to remind Americans Monday that it's the first such annual observance since the 9/11 terrorist attacks that U.S. combat troops aren't fighting a major war", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "In Memorial Day tribute to fallen troops, Obama cites his role in endi"}, "Author": "Dave Boyer", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "War Conflict, Politics, Afghanistan, Memorial Day, Arlington"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4345\"", "article_summary": "\u201cFor many of us, this Memorial Day is especially meaningful,\u201d Mr. Obama told a crowd of about 5,000 at Arlington National Cemetery on Monday.\nAnd in Iraq, Mr. Obama is resisting calls to send more troops to train and advise Iraq forces besieged by the Islamic State guerrilla army.\nPresident Obama used the Memorial Day holiday to remind Americans that it\u2019s the first such annual observance since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks that U.S. combat troops aren\u2019t fighting a major war on distant battlefields.\nThe president said U.S. troops are still in harm\u2019s way, in spite of the official end of America\u2019s combat role in the war in Afghanistan.\n\u201cTroops of such caliber demand great leaders, and there\u2019s no doubt they have one in our commander-in-chief,\u201d Mr. Carter said."}
