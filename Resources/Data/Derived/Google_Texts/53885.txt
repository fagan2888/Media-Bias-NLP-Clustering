Bob Morgan, 34, a Northern Illinois University College of Law alumnus, has been named to the third annual “Double Chai in the Chi: 36 Under 36″ list of young Jewish movers and shakers in Chicago. The letters of the Hebrew word “Chai,” which means “life,” also represent the number 18.

Morgan, whose role with the Illinois Department of Public Health has him working fervently on issues related to the Affordable Care Act and medical marijuana regulation, serves on the board of the Anti-Defamation League and the public policy committee of the National Fragile X Foundation.

He also volunteers with the Illinois Special Olympics and is an advocate against bullying.

Presented by the Jewish United Fund/Jewish Federation of Metropolitan Chicago’s Young Leadership Division (YLD) and Oy!Chicago, an outreach website for Chicago 20- and 30-somethings, the list shines a spotlight on the faces of Chicago’s Jewish future and recognizes the amazing contributions of this generation. The young professionals featured are noted for making a difference through their work, giving back in their free time, and earning notoriety in the Jewish community and beyond.

“We were overwhelmed by both the volume and exceptionally high quality of the nominations this year,” said Stefanie Pervos Bregman, founding editor and blogger-in-chief for Oy!Chicago. “If this list is any indication, the future of Chicago’s Jewish community is incredibly bright.”

“This is not just a list honoring those who have had tremendous professional, monetary, or business success; nor is it a reflection of observance or participation in Judaism,” said Joe Seigle, former YLD president and one of last year’s winners. “This list reflects people who, through both their professional and philanthropic endeavors, make the Jewish community stronger and more vibrant.”
