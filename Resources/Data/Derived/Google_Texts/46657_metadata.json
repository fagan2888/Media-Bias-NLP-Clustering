Previously, world health authorities believed the only samples left were in high security laboratories in Atlanta, Ga., and Russia\u2019s Novosibirsk, Siberia, but were surprised to find the six unaccounted for freeze-dried virus vials lying abandoned in cardboard boxes.\n\nThe disease has plagued human populations for thousands of years, until it was declared eradicated in 1980, thanks to a vaccination. The Associated Press reports the vials, which were found at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md., are sealed tight and no one has been neither infected nor can anyone find records of why or when the disease was stored in there to begin with. Smallpox can be deadly even after it is freeze-dried and stored. However, it needs to be kept cold to remain alive and dangerous.\n\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention Deputy Director Stephan Monroe said the vials may have been sitting there since the 1950s in room temperature, so it is unknown if the disease poses a health threat. \"We don't yet know if it's live and infectious. It's possible it could be inactivated because of long length of storage,\" Monroe told Fox News.\n\nSmallpox accounted for more than 300 million deaths in the 20th century, according to The College of Physicians of Philadelphia, with symptoms including fever, lethargy, headache, sore throat, and vomiting. Then, eventually, a rash spread through the face and body, and sores formed in the inside of the mouth, throat, and nose. After a few weeks, after fluid-filled pockets of skin grew over large areas of skin, scabs formed, and severe permanent scarring was left behind for the lucky that survived.\n\nThe debate about whether or not to destroy all found samples of smallpox has a long history in medicine. Many scientists believe the deadly virus should be completely destroyed in order to wipe it off the earth, while others believe it could be needed for research to improve vaccinations and treatments.\n\nIn May, the World Health Organization (WHO) met and decided to postpone the destruction of smallpox stocks. The health ministers, representing 194 member states, decided to set up a third advisory committee after the board was clearly divided and couldn\u2019t reach a conclusion by the end of the day.\n\nWHO\u2019s 1967 eradication efforts were a success after sending freeze-dried vaccinations to the 30 countries in need of a cure. Once they developed a system, they monitored and investigated the cases in each country. The outbreaks were then contained and ongoing research took fear\u2019s place until last week's discovery surprised everyone.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "smallpox, vials, found, unaccounted, cardboard, boxes, unknown, if, disease, alive", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Smallpox vials were found in a Maryland NIH laboratory, and researchers don't know where they came from.", "title": "Mystery Box Of Smallpox Vials Found, Puzzling World Health Leaders", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/smallpox-vials-found-unaccounted-cardboard-boxes-unknown-if-disease-alive-291936", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/08/vials-containing-smallpox-found-abandoned-and-unrecorded.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Smallpox vials were found in a Maryland NIH laboratory, and researchers don't know where they came from.", "title": "Mystery Box Of Smallpox Vials Found, Puzzling World Health Leaders", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/smallpox-vials-found-unaccounted-cardboard-boxes-unknown-if-disease-alive-291936", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/08/vials-containing-smallpox-found-abandoned-and-unrecorded.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/08/vials-containing-smallpox-found-abandoned-and-unrecorded.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-07-08T15:07:01-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-08T15:06:59-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Smallpox vials were found in a Maryland NIH laboratory, and researchers don't know where they came from."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd09d\"", "article_summary": "WHO\u2019s 1967 eradication efforts were a success after sending freeze-dried vaccinations to the 30 countries in need of a cure.\nPreviously, world health authorities believed the only samples left were in high security laboratories in Atlanta, Ga., and Russia\u2019s Novosibirsk, Siberia, but were surprised to find the six unaccounted for freeze-dried virus vials lying abandoned in cardboard boxes.\nIn May, the World Health Organization (WHO) met and decided to postpone the destruction of smallpox stocks.\nThe disease has plagued human populations for thousands of years, until it was declared eradicated in 1980, thanks to a vaccination.\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention Deputy Director Stephan Monroe said the vials may have been sitting there since the 1950s in room temperature, so it is unknown if the disease poses a health threat."}
