The innovation could open the door to medical devices and other electronics that are tough, but eco-friendly.\n\nWhy would anyone want to turn spider silk into wire? Many modern electronics are constructed with non-biodegradable plastics that, while durable, are harmful for the environment. Plastics coat steel wires for suspension brides and are found in countless everyday gadgets.\n\nThe researchers turned to spider silk as a possible replacement. The plan made sense, given spider silk is as strong as steel and as impenetrable as Kevlar; however, it\u2019s not a great conductor of electricity. To instill this property into the spider silk, the researchers coated each strand with carbon nanotubes, which are themselves nano-sized ropes made of the hardy element.\n\nScanning Electron Microscope (SEM) image of a bent carbon nanotubes coated spider silk fibre.

High-Performance Materials Institute.\n\nThe sleek arachnid threads were collected from golden silk spiders, Nephila clavipes, which are common in the southern regions of the U.S. These spiders produce long strands \u2014 up to 3 feet \u2014 making their silk easier to gather.\n\nAfter being coated with carbon, the super-spider silk was 300 times stronger than before, as well as more flexible and versatile. It also has a lifting strength that is 50 times stronger than muscle. These strands should, in theory, be extremely resilient against wear and tear, but ultimately biodegradable.\n\nPhotograph of spider silk fibres after coating with amine functionalised MWCNTs (f-CNTs).

Such a conductor could function as a building block for electronics destined for implantation in the body.\n\nWhat are carbon nanotubes?\n\nA couple of kinks need to be worked out before \u201csuper spider silk\u201d becomes a mainstream material. The spider silk can stretch when pulled, and the scientist found that extending by more than 50 percent dampened its electrical conductivity. Humidity caused a similar problem, but they found that adding extra layers of carbon nanotubes could prevent this effect.\n\nSource: Steven E, Saleh WR, Lebedev V, et al.
