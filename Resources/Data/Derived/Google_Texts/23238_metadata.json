The Tigers captured their first win in the National Collegiate Hockey Conference this season and improved to 5-13-1 overall and 1-8-1 in league play. The Mavericks fell to 14-6-3 overall and 8-4-1 in the NCHC but remained in first place in the league standings.\n\nFejes scored his first goal of the game to even the game at 2-apiece at the 7:27 mark of the second period when he took a centering pass from Jaccob Slavin and sent a one-timer past Omaha goalie Kirk Thompson. That goal came just 82 seconds after Omaha\u2019s Tyler Vesel scored to give the Mavericks their only lead of the contest at 2-1.\n\nSlavin picked up his second assist of the game 53 seconds into the third period when Sam Rothstein knocked home a power-play goal to give CC the lead for good at 3-2. Slavin won a battle along the boards and found Scott Wamsganz at the side of the net. Wamsganz tried to redirect the puck past Thompson but it slid across the front of the net to Rothstein, who put it in the open net.\n\nFejes made it 4-2 with an impressive individual play at the 10:20 mark of the final period. He stole the puck at his own blue line, carried it along the boards and beat Thompson top shelf from the left circle for his second-career two-goal game.\n\nThe Tigers withstood a furious Omaha comeback in the final minutes, but not before UNO\u2019s Jake Guentzel cut the lead to 4-3 with a power-play goal with 3:31 remaining after CC\u2019s Zach Aman was called for tripping and with Thompson on the bench in favor of an extra attacker. Then, just over a minute later, the Tigers\u2019 Alex Roos was called for hooking but his team killed that power-play opportunity, also with Thompson (20 saves) on the bench.\n\n\u201cThis was a huge win for us tonight,\u201d said CC head coach Mike Haviland. \u201cWe have really matured as a group.\u201d\n\nSlavin, who posted three points for the second consecutive game, opened the scoring with a wrister from the slot on the power play that beat Thompson at 6:05 of the opening frame. UNO\u2019s Brian O\u2019Roarke was called for a 5-minute major for interference 30 seconds earlier after a shot to the head of CC\u2019s Michael King. King did not return to the game. Rothstein and Bradley (two points each) assisted on Slavin\u2019s goal.\n\n\u201cSlavin was outstanding tonight,\u201d said Haviland. \u201cWe have talked about simplifying our power play and getting pucks on the net and that\u2019s what he did.\u201d\n\nIan Brady tied the game at 1-all at the 16:03 mark of the first period, beating CC\u2019s Tyler Marble on a 5-on-3 rush after two CC players collided and fell behind the Omaha net. Marble, who had 23 saves in CC\u2019s 4-1 victory over UConn on Jan. 6, finished Friday\u2019s game with 26 saves for his fourth win of the season.\n\nThe same two teams will battle Saturday, Jan. 17, beginning at 7:07 p.m.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Hunter Fejes scored twice, including an unassisted game-winning goal midway through the third period, to lead Colorado College to a 4-3 upset victory over No. 7 Nebraska Omaha", "language": "english", "author": "CC Media Relations", "og": {"description": "Hunter Fejes scored twice, including an unassisted game-winning goal midway through the third period, to lead Colorado College to a 4-3 upset victory over No. 7 Nebraska Omaha", "title": "Colorado College Upsets No. 7 Nebraska Omaha, 4-3", "url": "http://www.kktv.com/sports/headlines/Colorado-College-Upsets-No-7-Nebraska-Omaha-4-3-288944801.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/F67/8B3/F678B3A8A7064B90B0DFDCFC9A78B5B2", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/025/3B4/0253B4685C204A8A91D8BDB3B5456C9E.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kktv.com", "description": "Hunter Fejes scored twice, including an unassisted game-winning goal midway through the third period, to lead Colorado College to a 4-3 upset victory over No. 7 Nebraska Omaha", "creator": "@kktv11news", "url": "http://www.kktv.com/sports/headlines/Colorado-College-Upsets-No-7-Nebraska-Omaha-4-3-288944801.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/cchockey.jpg", "title": "Colorado College Upsets No. 7 Nebraska Omaha, 4-3", "site": "@kktv11news", "card": "summary"}, "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Colorado College Upsets No. 7 Nebraska Omaha, 4-3", "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "gUw-UdhXT7u-BunNWfQWA_t3azu7BEGubOcNT6HddJQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Colorado College Upsets No 7, Nebraska Omaha"}, "article_summary": "COLORADO SPRINGS, COLO. -- Hunter Fejes scored twice, including an unassisted game-winning goal midway through the third period, to lead Colorado College to a 4-3 upset victory over No.\n7 Nebraska Omaha Friday night at The Broadmoor World Arena.\nThe Mavericks fell to 14-6-3 overall and 8-4-1 in the NCHC but remained in first place in the league standings.\nThe Tigers captured their first win in the National Collegiate Hockey Conference this season and improved to 5-13-1 overall and 1-8-1 in league play.\nThat goal came just 82 seconds after Omaha\u2019s Tyler Vesel scored to give the Mavericks their only lead of the contest at 2-1."}
