The Daily Show’s Samantha Bee investigated why Medicare spent $172 million on penis pumps in the last five years without any apparent objection from Republicans – even as they shriek about the contraception mandate for women in the Affordable Care Act.

Some of our favorite Fox News personalities come in for a ribbing here: Kimberly Guilfoyle, Sean Hannity and Mike Huckabee. Each was shown carping about having to pay for people’s “sexual choices” as Guilfoyle put it. Yet Bee couldn’t find a single instance of complaint about the penis pump.

NARAL’s Ilyse Hogue explained to Bee, “Statistics show that probably some members of our Congress have a vested interest in having penis pumps covered by Medicare.”

Bee displayed an array of photos of Congressmen and asked, “What would all these gray-haired, old Rip Van Winkles possibly have to gain by not raising objections to penis pumps? Oh, yeah. No, I get it."

Hilarious.
