New York is the latest state to reject President Barack Obama's so-called healthcare "fix." Gov. Andrew Cuomo said there was no need for insurance companies to restore canceled policies that do not meet the minimum requirements under Obamacare.The insurance companies quickly agreed with the governor, according to the New York Post. "Let’s move forward," said Leslie Moran, spokeswoman for the New York State Health Plan Association.The president last week called on insurance companies to extend canceled policies for at least a year, but insurers aren't required to comply.In New York, where the Post reported 100,000 residents had received cancellation notices, Cuomo said the state-run insurance-exchange website is working well and that people facing cancellations will be able to pick up new and better coverage in the Obamcare marketplace.“We haven’t had the kind of issues in New York in our exchange that they’ve had nationwide. Our program has actually been working well. The website has been working well,” Cuomo said, according to the Post.Washington was the first state to reject the president's fix, which came in response to criticism that he failed to keep his promise that people would be able to keep their existing coverage plans if they chose to do so.Washington Insurance Commissioner Mike Kreidler all but said the president's move was not "in the interest of keeping the consumer protections we have enacted and ensuring that we keep health insurance costs down for all consumers."State health officials in Rhode Island also rejected Obama's call for one-year renewals of canceled plans, saying the state had invested too much effort in a rigorous screening process to ensure that insurance policies met the requirements spelled out in the Affordable Care Act, the Providence Journal reported.
