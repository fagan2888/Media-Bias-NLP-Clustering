I currently have the New American Standard Bible. How accurate is this? What are your thoughts on the New English Translation?\n\nNote: This is a direct response to our immediately preceding Religion Q & A : \"Why were some verses removed from the New Testament?\"\n\nTHE RELIGION GUY\u2019S ANSWER:\n\nThere are so many different English translations in today\u2019s alphabet soup of a marketplace that Dale\u2019s dilemma is common. Other responses to the August 16 Religion Q & A show there\u2019s considerable anxiety out there, but the Religion Guy reassures readers they can rely upon any of the modern mainstream translations. That includes Dale\u2019s NASB and NET. Not to say there aren\u2019t important variations in wording that today\u2019s Bible readers should know about and ponder, so it\u2019s good to have a couple or three translations handy. And one blessing of our Internet age is that you can compare 52 English translations, verse by verse, at that familiar website -- www.biblegateway.com.\n\nLoose paraphrases like \u201cThe Living Bible,\u201d \u201cThe Message,\u201d or J.B. Phillips\u2019 elegant \u201cThe New Testament in Modern English\u201d are valuable for fresh thinking and enjoyable reading. But they aren\u2019t Bibles. Then we have actual Bibles that are not paraphrases but lean toward \u201cdynamic equivalence\u201d translation that aims at clear comprehension and flow of thoughts. That\u2019s an OK choice but serious students and seminarians, at least, should own a translation with more literal renderings of the original Greek and Hebrew such as Dale\u2019s NASB (more on that version below).\n\nAnother example is the Revised Standard Version (1952, 2nd edition 1971). The RSV is often the Religion Guy\u2019s preference for journalistic writing because of closeness to familiar phrasing from the ever-popular King James Version of 1611, wide ecumenical acceptance and many years of usage. The RSV phrasing in turn underlies a current evangelical favorite, the English Standard Version (ESV) of 2001.\n\nMany editions include study aids that explain the text. These can be very helpful and are usually interesting, but readers should be aware that any add-ons are interpretations, not Holy Writ as such. As mentioned, another consideration in choices is that a translation may lean toward thought-for-thought ease of understanding, or toward word-for-word literalness. Then there\u2019s the lively debate over use of gender-inclusive language, featured especially in the National Council of Churches\u2019 New Revised Standard Version (NRSV) of 1989, a favorite of \u201cmainline\u201d Protestants.\n\nTurning to Dale\u2019s specific query, both versions he mentions were produced by non-denominational foundations with an Evangelical Protestant flavor that affirm the Bible\u2019s \u201cinerrancy\u201d (error-free nature not only in spiritual but historical aspects).\n\nContinue reading \"A common modern dilemma: Which Bible to use?\" by Richard Ostling.", "article_metadata": {"description": "DALE\u2019S QUESTION:\r\n\r\nI am no longer sure which Bible to use.
