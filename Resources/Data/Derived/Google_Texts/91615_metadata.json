The plan has an annual deductible of $250 per individual and $750 for a family. For a doctor\u2019s office visit, the charge is $20. For most other services, patients will pay 10 percent of the cost until they reach the out-of-pocket limit of $1,500 for an individual and $4,500 for a family.\n\nPreviously, Harvard employees paid a portion of insurance premiums and had low out-of-pocket costs when they received care.\n\nMichael E. Chernew, a health economist and the chairman of the university benefits committee, which recommended the new approach, acknowledged that \u201cwith these changes, employees will often pay more for care at the point of service.\u201d In part, he said, \u201cthat is intended because patient cost-sharing is proven to reduce overall spending.\u201d\n\nThe president of Harvard, Drew Gilpin Faust, acknowledged in a letter to the faculty that the changes in health benefits \u2014 though based on recommendations from some of the university\u2019s own health policy experts \u2014 were \u201ccausing distress\u201d and had \u201cgenerated anxiety\u201d on campus. But she said the changes were necessary because Harvard\u2019s health benefit costs were growing faster than operating revenues or staff salaries and were threatening the budget for other priorities like teaching, research and student aid.\n\nIn response, Harvard professors, including mathematicians and microeconomists, have dissected the university\u2019s data and question whether its health costs have been growing as fast as the university says. Some created spreadsheets and contended that the university\u2019s arguments about the growth of employee health costs were misleading. In recent years, national health spending has been growing at an exceptionally slow rate.\n\nIn addition, some ideas that looked good to academia in theory are now causing consternation. In 2009, while Congress was considering the health care legislation, Dr. Alan M. Garber \u2014 then a Stanford professor and now the provost of Harvard \u2014 led a group of economists who sent an open letter to Mr. Obama endorsing cost-control features of the bill. They praised the Cadillac tax as a way to rein in health costs and premiums.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDr. Garber, a physician and health economist, has been at the center of the current Harvard debate. He approved the changes in benefits, which were recommended by a committee that included university administrators and experts on health policy.\n\nIn an interview, Dr. Garber acknowledged that Harvard employees would face greater cost-sharing, but he defended the changes. \u201cCost-sharing, if done appropriately, can slow the growth of health spending,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to be prepared for the very real possibility that health expenditure growth will take off again.\u201d\n\nBut Jerry R. Green, a professor of economics and a former provost who has been on the Harvard faculty for more than four decades, said the new out-of-pocket costs could lead people to defer medical care or diagnostic tests, causing more serious illnesses and costly complications in the future.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s equivalent to taxing the sick,\u201d Professor Green said. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any government in the world that would tax the sick.\u201d\n\nMeredith B. Rosenthal, a professor of health economics and policy at the Harvard School of Public Health, said she was puzzled by the outcry. \u201cThe changes in Harvard faculty benefits are parallel to changes that all Americans are seeing,\u201d she said. \u201cIndeed, they have come to our front door much later than to others.\u201d\n\nBut in her view, there are drawbacks to the Harvard plan and others like it that require consumers to pay a share of health care costs at the time of service. \u201cConsumer cost-sharing is a blunt instrument,\u201d Professor Rosenthal said. \u201cIt will save money, but we have strong evidence that when faced with high out-of-pocket costs, consumers make choices that do not appear to be in their best interests in terms of health.\u201d\n\nHarvard\u2019s new plan is far more generous than plans sold on public insurance exchanges under the Affordable Care Act. Harvard says its plan pays 91 percent of the cost of services for the covered population, while the most popular plans on the exchanges, known as silver plans, pay 70 percent, on average, reflecting their \"actuarial value.\u201d\n\n\"None of us who protested was motivated by our own bottom line so much as by the principle,\u201d Ms. Lewis said, expressing concern about the impact of the changes on lower-paid employees.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn many states, consumers have complained about health plans that limit their choice of doctors and hospitals. Some Harvard employees have said they will gladly accept a narrower network of health care providers if it lowers their costs. But Harvard\u2019s ability to create such networks is complicated by the fact that some of Boston\u2019s best-known, most expensive hospitals are affiliated with Harvard Medical School. To create a network of high-value providers, Harvard would probably need to exclude some of its own teaching hospitals, or discourage their use.\n\n\u201cHarvard employees want access to everything,\u201d said Dr. Barbara J. McNeil, the head of the health care policy department at Harvard Medical School and a member of the benefits committee. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to be restricted in what institutions they can get care from.\u201d\n\nAlthough out-of-pocket costs over all for a typical Harvard employee are to increase in 2015, administrators said premiums would decline slightly. They noted that the university, which has an endowment valued at more than $36 billion, had an unusual program to provide protection against high out-of-pocket costs for employees earning $95,000 a year or less. Still, professors said the protections did not offset the new financial burdens that would fall on junior faculty and lower-paid staff members.\n\n\u201cIt seems that Harvard is trying to save money by shifting costs to sick people,\u201d said Mary C. Waters, a professor of sociology. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why a university with Harvard\u2019s incredible resources would do this.
