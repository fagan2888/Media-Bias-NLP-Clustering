An elderly woman died this morning after a fire broke out in her Richland home.

The Allegheny County medical examiner's office and the county fire marshal were on the scene at 1037 Woodhill Drive.

The one-alarm blaze was reported at 3:09 a.m.

A mother and two daughters lived in the home, according to neighbors.

One daughter had to jump from a second story window to escape. Both were taken to hospitals.

The mother did not escape. Her body was removed this morning.

The medical examiner's office said her name would not be released today because dental records are needed to confirm her identity.

Neighbors said they heard two loud booms around 3 a.m. and speculated that oxygen tanks may have exploded.

County Emergency Services Chief Alvin Henderson Jr. said the cause and origin probably would not be known today.

Richland Fire Chief Jim Kelly said his firefighters arrived to find the house completely ablaze. They entered and for around 20 minutes tried to fight the fire from inside and out, but the heat became too intense.

The fire was suppressed after about an hour.
