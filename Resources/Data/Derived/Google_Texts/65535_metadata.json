HRAs allow employers to reimburse employees for eligible medical and insurance expenses. Which medical expenses are covered under an HRA? This article outlines qualified HRA medical expenses for 2015.\n\nWhat's Covered Under an HRA?\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service (IRS) establishes guidelines for what types of medical expenses may be reimbursed tax-free through an HRA. These expenses are outlined in IRS Publication 502. Common expenses are outlined below.\n\nWithin what the IRS says is reimbursable, an employer can restrict categories further. For example, an employer may set up an HRA to reimburse only out-of-pocket medical expenses not covered by their group health insurance plan.\n\nJust remember that each employer\u2019s HRA is different. Employers can choose to customize their HRA with different monthly allowances, varying allowances by class of employee, and specific reimbursable and non-reimbursable expenses (within the IRS guidelines). The HRA Plan Documents will always specify what type of expenses the HRA covers.\n\nEmployers are also customizing their HRAs (and other medical reimbursement plans) to be compliant with new Obamacare rules. In some cases, this includes modifying what is reimbursable or how the HRA is structured.\n\nRelated - What You Need to Know About HRAs and Obamacare\n\nHRA Qualified Medical Expenses for 2015\n\nSo, what exactly is covered under an HRA?
