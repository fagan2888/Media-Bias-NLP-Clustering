The number of companies offering insurance on Ohio\u2019s exchange has jumped from 12 to 16, assuaging concerns that competition would decrease, rather than increase under the new law. The new entries include Dayton-based Premier Health, a health network that is branching out into the insurance market for the first time, and a CO-OP called InHealth Mutual.\n\nCO-OP stands for consumer operated and oriented, an alternative model of health insurance that was set up by the original Affordable Care Act law.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve often thought about us as co-ops being very much like the credit union of health insurance,\u201d says InHealth CEO Jesse Thomas. \u201cWe are really owned by policy holders, we are governed by policy holders, and we don\u2019t look to make a profit like the for-profit companies that are publicly traded.\u201d\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, passed in 2010, created a loan program to fund these customer-owned health plans, but many have been slow to get off the ground and most states still don\u2019t have them. The CO-OP concept grew out of demand for a public option, a policy idea that was overwhelmed by the push to keep health insurance provision in the United States entirely in the private market.\n\nThomas says InHealth will offer services in all 88 counties of Ohio, and by the end of 2015 more than half of its board will have to be people who hold policies with the company. He says the goal throughout has been to be consumer-driven, and to specifically address the needs of Ohio\u2019s uninsured and underinsured residents. If the company finds itself with a surplus, that will go towards reducing premiums or improving care.\n\nAverage premium rates for plans available on the Ohio marketplace have gone up slightly since last year, although some plans have actually gotten cheaper. People can go to healthcare.gov to look at prices starting now; a \u201cwindow-shopping\u201d option allows you to preview the premium price, although it won\u2019t calculate your subsidy. This year\u2019s open enrollment period runs just three months, from Nov. 15, 2014 to Feb. 15, 2015, and deadline extensions are significantly less likely now that the website has been up and running for more than a year.\n\nThose don\u2019t get health coverage in 2015 will face even steeper tax penalties than the first year. Ohio residents under 65 are eligible for marketplace subsidies from the federal government if they make between 138 and 400 percent of the federal poverty level. Those who make above that can shop on the marketplace but won't get subsidies; those who make below that are likely eligible for Medicaid.\n\nLewis Wallace is WYSO's managing editor, substitute host and economics reporter.
