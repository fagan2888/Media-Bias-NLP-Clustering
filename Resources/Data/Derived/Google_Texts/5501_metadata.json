The presumptive GOP nominee has not named any advisers with notable health care policy experience, and few names have emerged as possible picks for top administration jobs \u2014 and some wouldn't want to serve a President Trump.\n\nBut a few names are being floated as potential HHS secretary \u2014 particularly Ben Carson, given his medical pedigree and strong support for Trump. The other names in the ether: Florida Gov. Rick Scott, who rose to prominence as CEO of hospital chain Columbia/HCA, and former Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, who held a top HHS post in the administration of George W. Bush and who was a sworn enemy of Obamacare while he was governor. All three have expressed support for Trump now that he's the presumptive nominee.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThose three names are just speculation at this point. Health care policy wonks are pretty much unanimous in saying they\u2019ve had no interactions with the Trump campaign and don\u2019t have a credible clue who he might turn to orchestrate his health care policy.\n\n\u201cWho the hell knows?\u201d said Thomas Scully, who served as CMS administrator under President George W. Bush. \u201cUnpredictable is the most you can say.\u201d\n\nTrump has backed some unorthodox ideas for a Republican \u2014 promising to provide health care to everyone, supporting negotiations over what Medicare pays for prescription drugs and simultaneously vowing to repeal Obamacare \u2014 leading some to suggest his picks for top jobs could also be surprising.\n\n\u201cHis philosophy on most things is pretty moderate,\u201d Scully said. \u201cYou\u2019d probably find he\u2019d surprise a lot of people by picking a lot of moderates and maybe even Democrats.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s incendiary rhetoric and lack of governing experience leads many to believe he\u2019ll have trouble attracting the best and brightest to his administration. And some high-profile conservative thinkers are already ruling out a post in the Trump administration.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d never consider doing it because I think the person at the top of the government would be really unfit for the job,\" said James Capretta, who oversaw health care programs at OMB during George W. Bush's first term.\n\nBut Dan Mendelson, president of Avalere Health, thinks that will change if Trump actually is in line for the presidency. In particular, Mendelson thinks jobs running agencies such as CMS or FDA could be attractive if Trump picks someone with little governing experience to oversee HHS.\n\n\u201cI would expect those picks to be very functional and people who know how to do their jobs,\u201d said Mendelson, who served in the Clinton administration. \u201cIn a world where the HHS secretary is more a visionary, or more of a political pick, the operating division heads get more authority and are able to operate more autonomously, and that would be my expectation for a Trump administration.\u201d\n\nSeveral health care policy wonks suggested Trump might look to the private sector for top posts given his business background and disdain for the Washington establishment. But Tom Miller, of the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute, pointed out there would also need to be a trove of mid-level officials who actually know how the giant bureaucracy works, which could present an opportunity for ambitious GOP congressional staffers.\n\n\u201cPunch their ticket for a couple of years in the executive branch and then they come back out on K Street,\u201d Miller predicted. \u201cThat\u2019s the food chain of health policy.\u201d\n\nMany conservative health care policy experts, who overwhelmingly supported other candidates in the primary contest, are still processing the reality that Trump will be the nominee. The Manhattan Institute\u2019s Avik Roy, who advised the campaigns of former Texas Gov. Rick Perry and Sen. Marco Rubio, said he doesn\u2019t plan to vote for Trump in November.\n\n\u201cI honestly don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d Roy said. \u201cI\u2019m not a fan of Hillary either.\u201d\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean, however, that he\u2019s ruled out serving in a Trump administration if that comes to pass.\n\n\u201cIf the president asks you to serve, I don\u2019t think you just dismiss it out of hand,\u201d Roy said. \u201cI think you have to take it seriously and consider it.\u201d\n\nAuthors:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Health care policy wonks are pretty much unanimous in saying they\u2019ve had no interactions with the Trump campaign and don\u2019t have a credible clue who he might turn to orchestrate his health care policy.", "title": "The guessing game begins over Trump's health care picks", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/trumps-track-record-offers-few-clues-about-health-care-picks-222960", "image": "http://static.politico.com/ae/0a/ed7566544f6eab677b4bd96b3e8d/donald-trump-9-gty-1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Health care policy wonks are pretty much unanimous in saying they\u2019ve had no interactions with the Trump campaign and don\u2019t have a credible clue who he might turn to orchestrate his health care policy.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "| Getty The guessing game begins over Trump's health care picksA Donald Trump administration is likely to prove as unorthodox as his campaign \u2014 and that extends to the health care realm.\nHealth care policy wonks are pretty much unanimous in saying they\u2019ve had no interactions with the Trump campaign and don\u2019t have a credible clue who he might turn to orchestrate his health care policy.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the food chain of health policy.\u201dMany conservative health care policy experts, who overwhelmingly supported other candidates in the primary contest, are still processing the reality that Trump will be the nominee.\n\u201cI\u2019m not a fan of Hillary either.\u201dThat doesn\u2019t mean, however, that he\u2019s ruled out serving in a Trump administration if that comes to pass.\nAnd some high-profile conservative thinkers are already ruling out a post in the Trump administration."}
