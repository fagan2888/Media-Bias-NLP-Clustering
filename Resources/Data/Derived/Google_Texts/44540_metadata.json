John McCain for his U.S. Senate seat brought her plucky, long-shot campaign to Payson with an appearance before the Payson Tea Party last week.\n\nStaunchly conservative, Mohave County state senator Dr. Kelli Ward attacked McCain as out of touch and too liberal, while blasting the Affordable Care Act, Common Core academic standards and any attempt to regulate firearms.\n\nPollsters say McCain is vulnerable in the Republican primary, despite having served for 30 years in the Senate and as the Republican presidential candidate against Barack Obama. He has been censured by the Gila County Republican Party, as well as the Maricopa County Republican Party \u2014 mostly for supporting comprehensive immigration reform.\n\nThe Duke University educated primary care physician said, \u201cWe really need to change the status quo in Washington, D.C. But if we keep electing the same people \u2014 and Senator McCain has been there for 30 years \u2014 can we expect a different outcome? You guys know the definition of insanity \u2014 and that\u2019s just insane.\u201d\n\nShe spoke for nearly two hours, fielding a variety of questions. She heads the Senate Education Committee and got involved in a complicated and sometimes bitter confrontation between State Superintendent of Public Instruction Diane Douglas and Gov. Doug Ducey, both Republicans. The two have clashed about who controls the staff at the state department of education and whether the state should completely withdraw from Common Core standards or modify them to suit state needs.\n\nCommon Core\n\nSen. Ward carried a bill that would have clarified who controlled the department of education staff, but the effort at conciliation fell apart when the rift between Ducey and Douglas deepened into a lawsuit.\n\nOne questioner said he\u2019d heard that the funding for Common Core comes from Saudi Arabia and that students would end up reciting Muslim prayers under its provisions.\n\nWard responded, \u201cCommon Core is an example of a federal takeover \u2014 if not an international takeover \u2014 of education. They don\u2019t call it Common Core in China, but it\u2019s exactly the same.\u201d\n\nWhen she tried to explain the idea behind the national academic standards developed by educators and consultants under the umbrella of the National Council of Governors she said, \u201c(My) friend said, \u2018That\u2019s communism, that\u2019s communism straight up\u2019 and he lived under it.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018I lived in a place where people could knock on your door and take you away and no one would ever see you again.\u2019\u201d\n\nShe added that many people who listen to left-wing talk radio programs are unabashed socialists. \u201cWhen you listen to how extreme they are you understand why we\u2019re going in a downward spiral.\n\n\u201cI want to fight for our representative Republic, our system of the free market, our great Constitution.\n\n\u201cYou have to have people who are willing to fight for that against the extremes \u2014 the people who want to be Europe \u2014 or worse \u2014 want to be communists. I want to pull Common Core up by the roots.\u201d\n\nImmigration reform\n\nShe also took a strong position against comprehensive immigration reform as supported previously by McCain, which would combine tough enforcement measures on the border with a guest worker program and some means by which people who have lived her for a long time illegally could seek to eventually legalize their status.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to hear about comprehensive immigration reform \u2014 it\u2019s a code word for amnesty,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we can reward people who have come here illegally. We have to secure our borders so we know who is coming and going.\u201d\n\nOne questioner asked whether she considers criminal checks for people who buy guns an infringement of constitutional rights.\n\nShe said she had sponsored a state law that would essentially bar regulation of guns, which didn\u2019t make it through the Legislature. She said of the Second Amendment guarantee of the right to bear arms, \u201cThat right shall not be infringed and it comes from our Creator and that\u2019s that.\u201d\n\nClive Bundy trip controversy\n\nShe also talked about her trip to Nevada to talk with Clive Bundy and his supporters during a standoff with federal authorities, after the rancher for years refused to pay grazing fees for his cattle to graze on public lands.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s common knowledge I was here. That\u2019s one of the things the opposition has already polled and they think it\u2019s a bad thing. I went there to support our Constitution. I support our First Amendment right to free speech \u2014 that\u2019s why it\u2019s so great to be in the United States. Look at what happened in China in Tiananmen Square. So I went up there to do just that. There were people with guns. They were not pointing guns at the federal government. They were just armed. It was kind of scary.\u201d\n\nHealth care reform\n\nWard also spoke strongly against Arizona\u2019s participation in the health exchanges, which have provided health insurance for millions of people through the Affordable Care Act. The legislation allowed states to set up insurance exchanges, but provided for federally run health exchanges if states decided not to set up their own. A federal lawsuit now before the U.S. Supreme Court would deny insurance subsidies to people that have a federal, rather than a state exchange \u2014 including Arizona. Another lawsuit brought by state lawmakers seeks to repeal Arizona\u2019s decision to expand eligibility for health coverage through the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System for people making up to 100 percent of a federal poverty wage.\n\n\u201cIf the court case passes and I think it should, those subsidies will go away and Obamacare will crumple in on itself. It cannot stand. Guess what: As soon as that court case comes through, we are going to be pressured to take the federal heroin \u2014 the money. Heroin is a very dangerous substance. One time of using it can leave you addicted and dead. That\u2019s where we are as a society. But there\u2019s a chance to make it crumple if we are strong.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The doctor-turned-state-senator challenging Sen.
