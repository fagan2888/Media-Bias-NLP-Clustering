Ms. McCray, whose husband has assigned her a taxpayer funded staff, has taken to dropping in on administration officials meeting to discuss children\u2019s issues, a role the electorate neglected to confer on her. Never mind. At a recent meeting she asked for permission to sing to the assembled pols, and treated them to a lullaby she had used with her own children, presumably to emphasize the importance of music to children. After what could only be characterized as an obligatory round of applause, reports the New York Times, the administration aides \u201ctaken with Ms. McCray\u2019s impromptu performance\u201d decided to record her lullaby, which \u201cwill soon be featured in a promotion about early childhood development.\u201d Talent will out.\n\nOf course, none of this first lady stuff will be relevant should Hillary Clinton succeed in bringing her family back to the White House, along with her private email server. We have had no experience with a First Gentleman, so one hopes Bill will take Margaret Thatcher\u2019s husband, Denis as a model. Denis always kept out of the limelight: his motto, \u201cAlways present, never there.\u201d With the exception of an outburst or two -- refusing to act as escort to Winnie Mandela at an official function being one such. His money-making career ended when his wife became Prime Minister, and she in turn prepared his breakfast whenever her travel schedule permitted. It is, of course, uncertain that Bill has the capacity for self-effacement that Denis exhibited. If Hillary proves a less attractive campaigner than Bill, we may never know.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Bill de Blasio,Hillary Clinton,Michelle Obama,Irwin M.
