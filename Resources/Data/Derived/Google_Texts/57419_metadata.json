The charity's name is in reference to the 22 veterans who commit suicide each day. The ring, which is designed to be worn on the trigger finger, is a \u201csilent salute\u201d to veterans.\n\nTrump after he donned the ring.\n\nAfter the veterans from 22Kill departed the stage, Trump then invited Diamond and Silk, who went viral for their \"Stump for Trump\" video, to the stage. They spoke for a short while before Trump returned.\n\nMysteriously, mere minutes after receiving the ring and placing it on his right index finger, the ring had vanished.\n\nNote the bare ring finger\n\n22Kill took to their Twitter to defend their involvement in the rally, noting that it was not an endorsement.\n\nWe're not saying that #22KILL supports #Trump... We're saying that Trump supports #22KILL \u2014 #22KILL (@022KiLL) January 29, 2016\n\nMeanwhile, what actually happened to the ring is currently unknown. It's entirely possible that the ring was too big, but it's kind of strange he couldn't keep it on for more than a few minutes.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Where did it go?.05/27/2016 8:06:46AM EST.", "author": "Christine Rousselle", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Where did it go?", "title": "Christine Rousselle - Donald Trump Receives 'Honor Ring' From Veterans' Charity; Immediately Removes It", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/christinerousselle/2016/01/28/donald-trump-receives-honor-ring-from-veterans-charity-immediately-removes-it-n2111634", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/28/72340e93-c97a-4ee0-981c-fa9ad66dd6f0.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Where did it go?", "title": "Christine Rousselle - Donald Trump Receives 'Honor Ring' From Veterans' Charity; Immediately Removes It", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/christinerousselle/2016/01/28/donald-trump-receives-honor-ring-from-veterans-charity-immediately-removes-it-n2111634", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/28/72340e93-c97a-4ee0-981c-fa9ad66dd6f0.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Donald Trump Receives 'Honor Ring' From Veterans' Charity; Immediately Removes It, Christine Rousselle, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "We're not saying that #22KILL supports #Trump...
