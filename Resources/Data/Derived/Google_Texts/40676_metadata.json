Kennedy during his show \u201cReal Time\u201d on Friday. But in doing so, the outspoken liberal slammed President Ronald Reagan, comparing \u201csex machine\u201d Kennedy to \u201camiable square\u201d Reagan.\n\nWaiting until the end of his show to pay tribute to JFK, who was assassinated 50 years ago Friday, Maher contrasted the two Presidents in his \u201cNew Rules\u201d segment, offering high praise for Kennedy and coining Reagan as a boring President who advocated for the rich. While many on the Right claim Reagan to be the \u201cRepublican\u2019s Kennedy,\u201d Maher said they couldn\u2019t be more wrong.\n\n\n\n\u201cRepublicans must be given some credit today for not saying out loud what they\u2019re really thinking: that [Kennedy] really wasn\u2019t all that great. Now I disagree, but in the interest of reaching across the isle, let me admit, I get that. I do,\u201d he said. \u201cYou just don\u2019t get a lump in your throat for John F. Kennedy. You get a lump in your throat for Ronald Reagan. He\u2019s the Republican\u2019s Kennedy.\u201d\n\nMaher referenced a comment made by 2008 Republican Vice Presidential nominee Sarah Palin, who said the GOP was lacking a Ronald Reagan today and noted if there was a Reagan-esque political, she would put her faith in him.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s quite a hold on someone. After all, when Reagan was elected, Sarah Palin was barely 16, probably pregnant but still in third grade,\u201d Maher countered.\n\nThe host then reiterated what he believed to be the difference between Republicans and Democrats.\n\n\u201cWe have Kennedy, you have Reagan,\u201d Maher said. \u201cWe have marijuana. You have Metamucil. We want gays in the military. You want them in the airport restroom.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cReal Time\u201d host went on to make a host of comparisons between the two Presidents, noting Kennedy was cooler, younger and ambitious, while Reagan was old, outdated and boring.\n\n\u201cBut can we on this day at least agree that Kennedy was cooler? I mean, sorry, but our liberal icon was a smart, sexy war hero who said he wanted to go to the moon,\u201d Maher said. \u201cYours is an old fuddy duddy who tried to rock denim. Our guy was Don Draper. Yours was Rooster Cogburn.\u201d\n\nThe outspoken liberal continued his monologue, saying, \u201cKennedy\u2019s time was the time of \u2018ask not what your country can do for you.\u2019 Reagan\u2019s was the time of \u201cgreed is good.\u2019 JFK was far from perfect. But he was a true wit and a sex machine and he knew how to wear a pair of shades. Reagan was an amiable square in a cowboy hat who had sex with a woman he called \u2018Mommy.'\u201d\n\nMaher closed his show with saying that no matter how much Republicans claim Reagan to be their Kennedy, Democrats, in the end, walk away victorious.\n\n\u201cLove him or hate him, we win,\u201d he said. \u201cRepublicans can call Reagan their Kennedy all they want. But it\u2019s like calling Miller High Life the champagne of beers. \u2026 Our Kennedy, is Kennedy.\u201d\n\nCheck out the segment below.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "HBO host Bill Maher paid a touching tribute to late President John F.
