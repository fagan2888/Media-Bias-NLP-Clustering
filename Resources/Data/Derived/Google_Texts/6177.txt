It’s time for Denver to go back to its 100-year legacy of big ideas and optimism. Begin with a few simple rules:

• Substitute the word “mobility” for “traffic and transportation.” Moving people and goods from place to place depends on location and adjacencies. In a dense urban environment, optimal mobility accommodates a balance of pedestrians, bicyclists, vehicles and transit.

In suburban or rural areas, mobility adapts to different scales and modes. Applying the same priorities, rules and measures to Denver’s urban grid makes as much sense as building light rail from Rocky Ford to Olathe.

• Sin boldly, then beg forgiveness. Local, state and federal regulatory agencies are risk-averse. And an exhaustive process and institutional caution muzzle progress. Rather than carefully examining every possible metric of what may be transformative, experiment with a pilot project and examine the results. If it works, implement. If it doesn’t, adjust.

• Walk and chew gum. The Platte River, the National Western, Interstate 70 and Brighton Boulevard are one piece of a larger city and region, not four pieces of a single initiative. Downtown Denver’s edges should not begin at Colfax and Broadway and end behind Union Station at the Central Main Line. Extend downtown’s perimeter southeast to Speer and Colorado and northwest to I-25 and Brighton Boulevard/East 40th Avenue.

•

Restore every downtown street to two ways, from Cleveland Place to Wewatta, including 14th, 15th, 17th, 18th and 19th Streets. If improving circulation on these streets doesn’t make the Central Business District safer and more appealing to residents, retailers and visitors, put cars back on the 16th Street Mall, along with dedicated bike lanes and a trolley.

• Connect downtown and Cherry Creek with transit. Begin with pop-up transit, accessible through a phone app for Uber-style buses. For example, San Francisco’s Leap Transit or Boston’s Bridj, six- to 10-person coaches with comfortable seats and WiFi. If the pilot is successful, build Bogotá-style bus rapid transit, connecting Colfax, Speer and University Boulevard and link Denver’s key commercial centers with a safe, clean and efficient alternative to the single-person vehicle. To ensure seamless transitions, locate bike shares, Cars2Go and pedestrian connections next to every station.

Other priorities:

• Build a large festival park adjacent to the Platte River, at the southwest quadrant of the National Western Stock Show site. The amenity would restore the integrity of neighborhood-serving parks, including City Park and Civic Center.

• Transform the infrequently occupied historic Carnegie Library to a boutique hotel with a grand public restaurant on the main floor, including an outdoor terrace on the south. Twenty-four-hour activity solves a lot of problems.

• Add a first-rate dining spot and open the beautiful lobby bars in the Ellie Caulkins Opera House when the hall is dark. At the same time, transform the under-used sculpture park behind the Denver Performing Arts Complex to an inviting public square by adding shade trees, seating areas, and engaging outdoor rooms.

Finally, change Denver’s motto from the Mile High City to No Penalty for Delight!

“Make no little plans; they have no magic to stir men’s blood and probably themselves will not be realized. Make big plans; aim high in hope and work.” — Daniel Hudson Burnham (1846-1912)
