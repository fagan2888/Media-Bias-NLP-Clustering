On Thursday, to deal with some of the grousing about canceled insurance plans, President Obama announced an administrative fix to allow people to keep those crummy plans (that they think they like) for up to a year. This should quiet some of the complaints within his own party, though certainly not Republicans, who will just find another reason to attack Obama and health care reform.\n\nOne hopes this fix will put the focus back on making Obamacare implementation as successful and effective as possible.\n\nIt\u2019s certainly not there yet. On Wednesday, the Obama administration announced that just more than 106,000 Americans had enrolled in health insurance plans through Obamacare exchanges, and another 975,000 people had shopped for plans but not enrolled in a selection yet. No one is cheering these numbers \u2014 well, no one except those Republicans who didn\u2019t want anyone to have access to affordable, quality private health insurance options in the first place.\n\nThe 106,000 enrollments are well below the 500,000 the White House had originally projected for this period before launch of the exchanges. The brouhaha over canceled insurance plans has muddied an otherwise positive law. But all of the above should be put in a broader context \u2014the context of enrollment in past comparable insurance systems, the context of what health insurance was like before the Affordable Care Act passed, and the context of its opponents\u2019 repeated lies meant to distort and destroy Obamacare.\n\nSo, here are a couple of handy charts to help you understand the reality of Obamacare and separate fact from fear-mongering.\n\nCHART 1: Romneycare enrollment\n\nLooking for an analog to what Obamacare enrollment might look like nationwide? Look no further than Massachusetts, which implemented a mini-version of Obamacare under then-Gov. Mitt Romney. In 2007, Romneycare wasn\u2019t even plagued by a bum website rollout \u2014 and enrollment was still gradual, as shown in this chart and explained by Jonathan Cohn at The New Republic.\n\nIt can be expected that people who need Obamacare the most \u2014 either because they\u2019re sick or because they\u2019re sick of their current expensive individual insurance \u2014 will enroll first, but everybody else, especially those who are currently uninsured, will wait until the last minute to sign up before they face the individual mandate penalty. Plus, even people who want their new plan to kick in on January 1, 2014, have until December 15 to enroll in a plan.\n\nAlso, choosing among the many options in the Obamacare exchanges does take time \u2014 which might explain, for instance, why almost 1 million people have logged into the exchange but not yet chosen an insurance option. With time, those numbers can be expected to grow.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "https://ionenewpittsburghcourier.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/health6420-300.jpg?w=150", "sailthru.author": "CNN", "description": "by Sally Kohn (CNN) -- The Obamacare website might still be slow, but the politics and context of Obamacare are shifting rapidly.
