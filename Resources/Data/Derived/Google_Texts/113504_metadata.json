An audio recording surfaced of President Barack Obama rehearsing the song with Colbert during the taping of the show\u2019s December 8 episode. Colbert and Obama were singing the song backstage, not realizing that their microphones were still on.\n\nHowever, Obama\u2019s duet with Colbert didn\u2019t make it to the show\u2019s final broadcast.\n\nDespite that, Obama was still a big part of Colbert\u2019s farewell lap, with the TV host choosing the President of The United States as the guest for one of his final shows before he takes over The Late Show. The two had an undeniable rapport that was apparent ever since his first guest appearance, way before Obama became president.\n\nEarlier in the episode, President Obama took over Colbert\u2019s \u201cThe Word\u201d segment.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been taking a lot of shots at my job, I\u2019ve decided to take a shot at yours,\u201d Obama said before starting the monologue. He poked fun at the Republicans, Obamacare, and even himself. \u201cNation,\u201d Obama began in true Colbert fashion. \u201cAs you know, I, Stephen Colbert, have never cared for our president. That guy is so arrogant. I bet he talks about himself in the third person.\u201d\n\nAfter the skit, Obama returned for a more traditional interview.\n\n\u201cWhen I go home, Michelle, Malia and Sasha give me a hard time,\u201d he told Colbert. \u201cThere are no trumpets, and they tease me mercilessly.\u201d In an example of the good-natured ribbing Colbert is known for, he made fun of Obama\u2019s string of civilian nominees for the secretary of defense. \u201cYou have employed a lot of people \u2013 mostly as secretary of defense,\u201d Obama joked.\n\nThe episode, which was taped at George Washington University, was a special episode Colbert dubbed: \u201cStephen Colbert Presents: Mr. Colbert Goes to Washington D.C. Ya Later, Legislator; Partisan is Such Sweet Sorrow: A Colbert Victory Lap.\u201d\n\nBefore making a name for himself as the host of The Colbert Report, Stephen Colbert was an improv comic and comedy writer who began his career at the famed Second City improv theater. In 1997, he joined the cast of The Daily Show as the fictional conservative pundit named\u2026 Stephen Colbert. His tenure lasted until 2005, when Comedy Central gave Colbert his own show.\n\n[Image via YouTube]", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"We'll Meet Again\" was picked as Stephen Colbert's farewell song for The Colbert Report, and while the star-studded performance featured people like George", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "\u201cWe\u2019ll Meet Again\u201d was picked as Stephen Colbert\u2019s farewell song for The Colbert Report, and while the star-studded performance featured people like George", "title": "Stephen Colbert And President Obama Singing \u2018We\u2019ll Meet Again\u2019 Surfaces Online", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/1697011/stephen-colbert-and-president-obama-singing-well-meet-again-surfaces-online/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/stephen-colbert-and-barck-obama.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-22T02:41:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-22T02:51:39+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/stephen-colbert-and-barck-obama.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2014-12-22T02:41:25+00:00", "fb": {"app_id": 164157850314499, "pages": 71179904752}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "barack obama,colbert report finale,comedy,comedy central,president obama,stephen colbert,the colbert report,the decree,the word,tv show,tv", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/stephen-colbert-and-barck-obama.jpg", "height": 409, "width": 670}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "\u201cWe\u2019ll Meet Again\u201d was picked as Stephen Colbert\u2019s farewell song for The Colbert Report, and while the star-studded performance featured people like George"}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce481\"", "article_summary": "The episode, which was taped at George Washington University, was a special episode Colbert dubbed: \u201cStephen Colbert Presents: Mr. Colbert Goes to Washington D.C.\nIn 1997, he joined the cast of The Daily Show as the fictional conservative pundit named\u2026 Stephen Colbert.\nEarlier in the episode, President Obama took over Colbert\u2019s \u201cThe Word\u201d segment.\nAn audio recording surfaced of President Barack Obama rehearsing the song with Colbert during the taping of the show\u2019s December 8 episode.\n\u201cAs you know, I, Stephen Colbert, have never cared for our president."}
