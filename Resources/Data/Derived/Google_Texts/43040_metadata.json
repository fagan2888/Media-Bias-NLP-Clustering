It is a demographic that enrollment workers and government officials have found hard to crack as they have set about signing up millions of Americans for coverage under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\n\nEnrollment for year two of the law ends Sunday, and the proportion of Hispanics signed up is expected to rise, although not by much. The federal government reported in January that about 10 percent of enrollment at the time was Hispanic or Latino, 3 percentage points better than at the same point last year.\n\nThe stakes are high for the Obama administration, which is seeking to get more people insured under the law and to garner more support among Hispanics. The group is projected to represent almost a third of the U.S. population by 2060, up from 17 percent in 2013.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to work to figure it out and reach the community,\u201d the U.S. health secretary, Sylvia Mathews Burwell, said in an interview today in Austin, Texas.\n\nHispanics say they are underrepresented in the law\u2019s insurance programs both for reasons common to many Americans and particular to their community. Many don\u2019t feel they need insurance, think the law\u2019s offerings will be too expensive, or find enrollment to be too confusing.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s the Law\u2019\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s some that don\u2019t want to pay for insurance because they don\u2019t need it because they\u2019re healthy,\u201d Irma Palos Diaz, 48, said in an interview before signing up at a clinic in south San Antonio run by CentroMed, a nonprofit health system subsidized by the federal government that serves mostly low-income people. \u201cWhat can we do? It\u2019s the law.\u201d\n\nMore than 30 percent of the U.S. uninsured population was Hispanic in 2013, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, a Menlo Park, California, research group. Yet only about 11 percent of people who used the federal healthcare.gov system in 2014 and chose to report their ethnicity identified themselves as Hispanic or Latino, according to the government.\n\nVictoria Cortez-Casillas, 41, said many Hispanics find the law intimidating and \u201cdon\u2019t know how to ask the question.\u201d They need personal help, she said, which is in short supply nationwide.\n\n\u201cThey haven\u2019t had someone come to them and explain it to them very well,\u201d she said in an interview after signing up at CentroMed.\n\nEnglish Memo\n\nEnrollment workers say another concern, specific to Hispanics, is that by signing up they many put undocumented family members in danger of deportation. Federal officials took that concern so seriously that in October 2013 they published a memo promising immigration authorities wouldn\u2019t use enrollment data.\n\n\u201cThey first released it only in English,\u201d said Jose Plaza, national director of Latino engagement for Enroll America, which organizes enrollment efforts in Texas and 10 other states. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t making its way down to the Latino community.\u201d\n\nWhile the memo has since been translated into Spanish, its existence is still largely unknown outside Washington. Local officials in San Antonio were surprised to hear of it.\n\nCulturally Competent\n\nMore than 94,000 people in San Antonio have so far enrolled for year two of the Affordable Care Act, and most of them are assumed to be Latino, given the city\u2019s demographics. The city\u2019s enrollment organization, called EnrollSA, has won notice in Washington for its work with Hispanics.\n\n\u201cYou have to think first about being culturally competent with our population,\u201d Andrea Guajardo, community health director at Christus Santa Rosa Health System and a co-chair of EnrollSA, said in an interview. The group is funded by Guajardo\u2019s hospital system and another local health system, Methodist Healthcare Ministries.\n\nOne example: On March 31 last year, technically the deadline to sign up, 4,000 people showed up at San Antonio\u2019s Alamadome at an EnrollSA event. Overwhelmed officials had to schedule many of them for follow-up meetings at CentroMed\u2019s southside clinic.\n\n\u201cWe created what we called a golden ticket,\u201d Guajardo said: yellow notecards of no official value, numbered 1 to 1,000, given to people turned away from the Alamadome. Many people handed over their unnecessary tickets when they reported to their follow-up meetings at CentroMed, Guajardo said.\n\n\u201cIt really did make them feel comfortable and assured they were going to be served,\u201d she said.\n\nFace to Face\n\nThe government isn\u2019t likely to significantly dent the uninsured Hispanic population without pouring many more resources into contacting Latinos personally, Hector De La Torre, executive director of the Transamerica Center for Health Studies, a research group based in Los Angeles, said in a phone interview.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve done all the TV commercials; they\u2019ve done all the stuff on the Internet,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is not going to reach the audience they\u2019ve left here. You really do have to go into those communities and see them face to face.\u201d\n\nAbout 1.1 million people had used the Spanish-language version of healthcare.gov by Feb. 6 and another 1.1 million called the federal government\u2019s Spanish-language help line -- \u201ca strong number,\u201d De La Torre said.\n\n\u201cThere were absolutely some improvements,\u201d he said.\n\nMore Mobile?\n\nBurwell said she would assess how her department can improve its work with Latinos after the close of enrollment this year, when the government learns more about the demographics of Affordable Care Act subscribers. The department knows that the group prefers personal assistance but is still trying to pinpoint how most Latinos sign up, she said.\n\n\u201cOne thing we do know is -- so they use more mobile, the Latino population uses more mobile,\u201d she said. \u201cIs that because they don\u2019t have access to other -- is their access to mobile? Is that because they\u2019re younger people? We don\u2019t actually know.\u201d\n\nDiaz, who said she earns about $400 every two weeks making tortillas for a local Mexican restaurant, emerged from her enrollment session with a plan from Ambetter, a Centene Corp. subsidiary, that she found affordable: $26.49 a month and a $500 limit on her annual out-of-pocket expenses, with $1 co-payments to see her primary care physician or fill generic prescriptions.\n\nSorting through options took her close to two hours, however, and she said she wasn\u2019t thrilled about committing to the monthly payment. Without assistance, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have signed up,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Alex Wayne", "twitter": {"description": "South San Antonio, where street signs for pawn shops and car-title lenders loom over strip malls and the ruins of a Spanish mission, should be fertile ground for Obamacare, a law built to extend health coverage to the working poor.", "title": "Latinos Elude Obamacare in Struggle to Lure Growing Population", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-13/latinos-elude-obamacare-in-struggle-to-lure-growing-population", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/isbnfGm75OAg/v4/-1x-1.jpg", "site": "@business", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-author": "Alex Wayne", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "Health,San Antonio,Law", "news_keywords": "Health,San Antonio,Law", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-13/latinos-elude-obamacare-in-struggle-to-lure-growing-population", "parsely-title": "Latinos Elude Obamacare in Struggle to Lure Growing Population", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-02-13T20:17:16.133Z", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "South San Antonio, where street signs for pawn shops and car-title lenders loom over strip malls and the ruins of a Spanish mission, should be fertile ground for Obamacare, a law built to extend health coverage to the working poor.", "parsely-tags": "Health,San Antonio,Law,Region: Global,Page: article", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.bwbx.io/business/public/images/favicons/mstile-144x144-bbd2101292.png", "date": "2015-02-13T20:17:16.133Z", "parsely-section": "science-energy", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "og": {"site_name": "Bloomberg.com", "description": "South San Antonio, where street signs for pawn shops and car-title lenders loom over strip malls and the ruins of a Spanish mission, should be fertile ground for Obamacare, a law built to extend health coverage to the working poor.", "title": "Latinos Elude Obamacare in Struggle to Lure Growing Population", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-13/latinos-elude-obamacare-in-struggle-to-lure-growing-population", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/isbnfGm75OAg/v4/-1x-1.jpg", "type": "website"}, "fb": {"status": "South San Antonio, where street signs for pawn shops and car-title lenders loom over strip malls and the ruins of a Spanish mission, should be fertile ground for Obamacare, a law built to extend health coverage to the working poor."}, "parsely-post-id": "NJOOUV6K514V01", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "parsely-image-url": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/isbnfGm75OAg/v4/-1x-1.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb3fe\"", "article_summary": "\u201cOne thing we do know is -- so they use more mobile, the Latino population uses more mobile,\u201d she said.\nThe group is funded by Guajardo\u2019s hospital system and another local health system, Methodist Healthcare Ministries.\nThe group is projected to represent almost a third of the U.S. population by 2060, up from 17 percent in 2013.\n\u201cYou have to think first about being culturally competent with our population,\u201d Andrea Guajardo, community health director at Christus Santa Rosa Health System and a co-chair of EnrollSA, said in an interview.\nIt\u2019s the law.\u201dMore than 30 percent of the U.S. uninsured population was Hispanic in 2013, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, a Menlo Park, California, research group."}
