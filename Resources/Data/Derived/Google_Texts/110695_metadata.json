Wojciech Jaruzelski, a survivor of a Siberian labor camp, was an unlikely servant to the Soviet Union and its communist ideology.\n\nPoland\u2019s last communist leader, the general in tinted glasses who was best known for his 1981 martial law crackdown on the Solidarity union, died Sunday at age 90 after a long struggle with cancer and a recent stroke.\n\nBorn into a patriotic and Catholic Polish milieu, Jaruzelski and his family were deported to Siberia by the Red Army during World War II. That harsh land took his father\u2019s life and inflicted snow blindness on Jaruzelski, forcing him to wear dark glasses.\n\nDespite his suffering at Soviet hands, Jaruzelski faithfully imposed Moscow\u2019s will on his subjugated nation until communism crumbled across the region in 1989.\n\nPoland is still deeply divided over whether to view Jaruzelski as a traitor who did Moscow\u2019s dirty work or as a patriot who made an agonizing decision to spare the country the bloodshed of a Soviet invasion.\n\nJaruzelski stirs up these emotions for his defining act: His 1981 imposition of martial law, a harsh crackdown aimed at crushing the pro-democracy Solidarity movement founded months earlier by Lech Walesa.\n\nCommenting on his death, Walesa called him a \u201cgreat man of the generation of betrayal.\u201d\n\n\u201cThose times were complicated. I\u2019m leaving the assessment to God,\u201d he said.\n\nJaruzelski preferred to be remembered for the negotiations he backed eight years later that helped dismantle the regime and set Poland on track to become a thriving democracy.\n\nThe image of Jaruzelski in his olive military uniform announcing martial law on state television remains iconic to Poles. Straight-backed and betraying no emotion, he announced martial law and the outlawing of Solidarity, the first independent labor union in the communist bloc.\n\nJaruzelski, who headed the government from 1981-85 and the party from 1981 until the communist regime\u2019s collapse in 1989, repeatedly defended his decision.\n\n\u201cThe greater evil would have been a (Soviet) intervention,\u201d he said in 2005.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1336\"", "article_summary": "WARSAW, poland \u2014 Gen.
