Connie Miller, a 52-year-old entrepreneur, lived alone on her Denton County ranch when she received the news that she had breast cancer.\n\n\u201cI had scheduled my annuals, and I knew I had a pea-sized lump in my right breast,\u201d Miller said. \u201cAfter the mammogram, the nurse took me aside and said, \u2018We need to take you across the hall for an ultrasound.\u2019\u201d\n\nAt first, Miller thought the medical team was being a little aggressive with their concern until the ultrasound raised several red flags. Not only did she have a tumor, it was of the triple-negative variety and it required surgical removal.\n\nBreast cancer affects 1 in 8 women and kills more than 40,000 per year, according to BreastCancer.org.\n\nTriple-negative breast cancer, however, poses its own unique threats in women \u2014 and men \u2014 with this type of tumor.\n\nMost treatment for breast cancer targets estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2. Triple-negative tumors lack these receptors, severely decreasing the patient\u2019s treatment options.\n\nAfter hearing her diagnosis and getting a second opinion, Miller started making arrangements for treatment. By that point, her tumor had grown to the size of a golf ball.\n\nMiller\u2019s best friend, Allison Barton of Krum, took Miller to Previty Clinic for Surgical Care in Beaumont for treatment on the recommendation of another friend, Lisa Saulsberry. Saulsberry happens to be the first assistant to the general surgeon, Dr. Garrett Peel, who works at the Beaumont clinic.\n\nMiller calls Barton her \u201cbest friend ever,\u201d and the two made the 300-mile journey together.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s comforting to know that your best friend is watching over you during surgery,\u201d Miller said.\n\nEven though the tumor was successfully removed, its triple-negative status remained a point of concern for doctors. After the surgery, Miller still had to face radiation treatment and chemotherapy.\n\nBoth types of therapy are painful and grueling for the people who suffer through them. Miller had to do two radiation treatments a day for an entire week after her surgery.\n\n\u201cI just slept,\u201d she said. \u201cAll I did was sleep.\u201d\n\nWhile chemotherapy has proven to be an effective cure for various types of cancer, Miller hit another hurdle during her treatment. Her body had an adverse reaction that caused her to cough so severely that she even broke a rib at one point.\n\nThe doctors ended her treatment a week early. Round 2 of chemo treatment didn\u2019t prove to be much better, as the concoction of chemicals caused her to break out into a rash over most of her body.\n\nTo top it off, the chemotherapy caused damage to her heart and lungs. In total, Miller had three extended stays in the hospital.\n\nAfterthoughts\n\nEven though Miller\u2019s cancer is gone, she has gained a new perspective. She credits her support network for helping her battle the disease, but she sadly reflects on the relationships that were also cut out of her life.\n\n\u201cSome of your best friends walk away. For whatever reason, who knows? But maybe it\u2019s because they can\u2019t handle it,\u201d Miller said. \u201cAt the same time, friends you didn\u2019t know you had step forward and become a pillar of strength.\u201d\n\nWhile losing friends remains the biggest disappointment that Miller faces, she also has much to say about certain charity organizations and foundations.\n\nEven though her business had gone under, she received very little help from any local or national nonprofits because she says she had \u201ctoo many assets.\u201d If it wasn\u2019t for the insistence of her mother and brother, she wouldn\u2019t have even registered for \u201cObamacare\u201d \u2014 something she considers to be the saving grace of her struggle.\n\n\u201cI was so afraid of losing my ranch,\u201d Miller said. \u201cI came within one month\u2019s payment of foreclosing on my home. Being unemployed, I didn\u2019t qualify for any public assistance. I tried everything.\u201d\n\nA cancer-free tomorrow\n\nMiller\u2019s journey through the white, fluorescent-lit hospital hallways has come to an end. After making a full recovery, she decided it was time to get back to living by completing her bucket list. She recently was in Michigan riding horses and reconnecting with her family and currently is on a trip to Japan.\n\nIn a twist that could come straight out of a Nicholas Sparks novel, while Miller was receiving her treatment, she met David Harris, a lay minister in the United Methodist Church. In the beginning, he was there to offer her prayers and support \u2014 often driving five hours to sit with Miller in the \u201cchemo chair.\u201d\n\nMiller found comfort in his visits and after spending time with him over this past year, the two are engaged to be married.\n\n\u201cWho meets somebody in a chemo chair, right?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Breast cancer patients depend on insurance and support systems to overcome the disease, and while breast cancer has a survival rate of more than 80 percent, the cost can be crippling for some.
