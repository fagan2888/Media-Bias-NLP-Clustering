The retired neurosurgeon, who has quietly toured political hot spots like Iowa and New Hampshire but has yet to announce a PAC or do much obvious fundraising, is the second choice to Romney, ahead of better-known (and better funded) potential GOP candidates like Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, Rand Paul or Ted Cruz.\n\nFor today\u2019s Long Read we at Washington Whispers helpfully offer a Ben Carson Primer to help those unfamiliar with the good doctor (and his somewhat unorthodox political views) get up to speed. We begin with a few fast facts from TIME magazine, which you can find by clicking here; it\u2019s baseline stuff about Carson\u2019s background, his medical career and which Oscar-winning actor played him in a Hollywood biopic a few years back.\n\nIt\u2019s not difficult to understand Carson\u2019s appeal: his up-from-poverty story appeals to conservatives, he\u2019s the only candidate this side of Rick Santorum openly espousing hard-core Christian values, which evangelicals love. Yet despite his hardscrabble upbringing and his legendary career performing brain surgery on children, to say that Carson\u2019s been an outspoken critic of Obamacare is an understatement:\n\nYet Carson really set conservative hearts aflutter in 2012 with what they saw as a truth-to-power speech he delivered before President Barack Obama at the National Prayer Breakfast:\n\nHaving collectively heard a stump speech or two since 1938, the Whispers staff found the speech entertaining but pretty mild \u2013 Carson never addresses Obama directly, doesn\u2019t look at the president during his remarks and even makes a pitch for what sounds like universal, cradle-to-grave health care, right around the 20-minute mark.\n\nBut what conservatives \u2013 and neglected evangelical voters \u2013 heard in the 30-minute speech was Carson delivering a withering critique of government, the welfare state, taxes and godlessness in American life, delivered to the face of president they believe embodies all those evils.\n\nAnd that\u2019s without even discussing Carson\u2019s race. Republicans see him as the \u201canti-Obama,\u201d a candidate of color with the kind of charisma and backstory that can break the Democrats\u2019 hammerlock on minority voters.\n\nFurther propelling Carson: A \"Draft Ben Carson\" movement that has raised hundreds of thousands of dollars and generated some attention for the would-be candidate. The organization has set up shop in Iowa, and the web site insists it has a statewide organization already in place should the doctor decide to toss his surgical cap into the ring.\n\nIf you\u2019re tempted to buy stock in Ben Carson for President, however, you might consider the liabilities as well as the assets in Carson\u2019s ledger.\n\nGoogle \u201cBen Carson and controversy\u201d and you\u2019ll find dozens of different stories regarding his views \u2013 and public remarks \u2013 on creationism (he believes in it), the violence in Ferguson (he thinks feminists are partly to blame) and less than enthusiastic views on gay rights. His remarks have gotten Carson prime spots on conservative radio and Fox News, but have led to his dis-invitation as a commencement speaker at Johns Hopkins University, where he was director of pediatric neurosurgery.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Washington Whispers [News]", "title": "Long Read: Run, Ben, Run", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Evangelical conservatives pray for Ben Carson to run for president.
