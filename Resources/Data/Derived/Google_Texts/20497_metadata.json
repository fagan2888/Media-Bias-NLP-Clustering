The first-ever court case alleging sex discrimination in a health care setting, filed in 2014, has been allowed to move forward.\n\nLast month, a judge in the case refused to grant Fairview Health System\u2019s motion for a delay pending the conclusion of OCR\u2019s investigation into the same incident underlying the case. The patient in this case is seeking financial damages as well as changes to Fairview\u2019s policies and procedures for transgender patients.\n\nOCR\u2019s July 14 settlement with TBHC was just one of two the agency announced last month; the other, issued July 10, calls for St. Elizabeth\u2019s Medical Center in Massachusetts to pay $218,400 and comply with a one-year corrective action plan to \u201ccure gaps\u201d in its \u201cHIPAA compliance program\u201d (see story, p. 1).\n\nActions Carry Deadlines\n\nOCR\u2019s announcement of the settlement provides no details regarding the complaint beyond that the patient was roomed with a male; the agency did not respond to questions from RPP about the case. Both OCR and TBHC issued short statements about the settlement, and they also contained no additional information.\n\nThe agency \u201cwas pleased to come to a voluntary agreement with TBHC, resolving a complaint filed by a transgender individual alleging discrimination on the basis of sex,\u201d OCR says in the statement to RPP. The agency noted that Section 1557 has been effective since the law\u2019s enactment, and OCR has been accepting and investigating complaints under this authority,\u201d and emphasized that \u201chospitals are barred from discriminating on the bases of race, national origin, disability, age, and sex, including gender identity and sex stereotyping.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, Jonathan Weld, acting CEO, says TBHC is \u201cextremely proud of the services we provide to all of our patients and were pleased to be able to resolve this issue with the OCR. We welcome transgender patients and look forward to many more years of serving them and the rest of our community.\u201d\n\nUnder a section in the agreement titled \u201cGeneral Obligations and Revision, Development and Implementation of Policies and Procedures,\u201d OCR specifies both broad and specific requirements, with deadlines attached to most of them.\n\nFor example, the hospital agreed that it would \u201cprovide all individuals with the full and equal enjoyment of the services, privileges, facilities, advantages, and accommodations of TBHC without discrimination\u201d and \u201cshall not discriminate on the basis of sex, which includes gender-based discrimination.\u201d\n\nWithin three months of the signing of the agreement, TBHC must \u201crevise all of its policies, procedures, regulations, and related documents and materials related to discrimination\u201d to state that it will not engage in \u201cgender-based discrimination.\u201d\n\nIt also must state that \u201cevery patient has the right to competent, considerate and respectful care that fosters their dignity and comfort and is free from all forms of discrimination\u201d and the right to \u201cprivacy and confidentiality during medical treatment or other rendering of care within TBHC.\u201d These statements must also be posted around TBHC\u2019s facilities, \u201cprovide the process for filing and resolving grievances about discrimination\u201d and list contact information for a responsible official.\n\nA related provision, which Gordon at Lambda hailed as particularly progressive, holds the hospital to account for not discriminating against individuals with an \u201cassociation\u201d to a transgender patient.\n\nImplementation May Prove Challenging\n\nThe agreement states TBHC \u201cshall not deny equal services, accommodations, or other opportunities to any individual because of the known relationship of the individual with a person based on the person\u2019s sex, including gender identity, gender expression, and nonconformity with gender stereotypes.\u201d\n\nDuring the next two years, TBHC must report to OCR on its progress implementing the terms of the agreement. It will be subject to other enforcement actions if it fails to complete the requirements to the satisfaction of OCR.\n\nTechnological challenges alone may make putting the requirements in place difficult, HIPAA expert Apgar tells RPP, and CEs could ironically end up violating a transgender patient\u2019s privacy rights under HIPAA.\n\nNew policies for intake, admitting and room assignment are based on processes of \u201cafford[ing] an opportunity for a Patient to provide both a legal and a preferred name, as well as the opportunity for an individual to identify their sex and/or gender, including transgender status (e.g. \u2018Transgender Female/Male-to-Female\u2019 or \u2018Transgender Male/Female-to-Male.\u2019\u201d\n\nEHRs May Be a Problem\n\nTBHC must document the patient\u2019s preferences, the settlement states. But Apgar says he doesn\u2019t believe most electronic health record (EHR) systems have data fields that can accommodate such information. \u201cTo my knowledge, EHRs aren\u2019t that sophisticated. Most can record sex, but the additional details regarding gender status, etc. would likely be noted in the chart notes,\u201d he says. \u201cThat means anyone with access to the chart notes would see the details.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, transgender patients may want to reveal their status to some treatment providers but not others. In this case, CEs will need to segregate this information or run the risk of violating the privacy rule.\n\nThis might push the limits of IT security, Apgar adds. \u201cSome EHRs have the ability to restrict access to certain portions of the record or set up \u2018break the glass\u2019 that notifies the treating provider that a patient\u2019s record has been accessed by another provider with access to the EHR. That wouldn\u2019t necessarily stop someone from looking.\u201d\n\nHe likens this to \u201can area where CEs need to pay as much attention to as what is often called especially sensitive health information such as HIV/AIDS, mental health, genetics, etc.,\u201d adding that \u201cthere need to be some improvements in EHRs to permit easier segregation of sensitive data.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the \u201cminimum necessary\u201d standard will also come into play in certain situations. For example, there may be no need for an emergency department physician to know a person is transgender to stitch up a cut or attend to a broken arm.\n\n\u201cCEs should make every effort to limit access to sex/gender identity information, including transgender status, to only those practitioners who really need access for treatment purposes and if it\u2019s necessary when assigning the patient the proper room,\u201d Apgar says. If the required documentation defaults to paper, CEs will need to address the need for heightened safeguards, he adds.\n\nHospital-Wide Reforms Are Recommended\n\nSome of the provisions in the settlement mimic those outlined in a 2013 report, Creating Equal Access to Quality Health Care for Transgender Patients: Transgender-Affirming Hospital Policies, developed by a group of organizations including Lambda Legal and the Human Rights Campaign Foundation. (For more information, see http://www.lambdalegal.org/blog/20131105_transgender-affirming-hospital-....)\n\nLambda\u2019s Gordon told RPP her organization has \u201cconfirmation\u201d from OCR officials that the agency utilized its report on transgender policies for hospitals. Although she praised the agreement, Gordon said it leaves out many specifics and is \u201cnot as robust or explicit\u201d as the policies Lambda and the other groups recommend.\n\nFor instance, under the agreement TBHC must not discriminate in its rooming policy. But OCR doesn\u2019t say what that means. The Lambda report, in contrast, recommends that, if single rooms are not possible, patients be placed with patients whose gender matches how they \u201cself-identify.\u201d The new settlement also does not address how bathroom access will be handled.\n\nNevertheless, she and others, including Kristen Eckstrand, M.D., Ph.D., founding chair of a transgender advisory committee for the Association of American Medical Colleges, say the settlement signals a new day for transgender patients, who studies show face significant hurdles in obtaining health care.\n\nEckstrand, former director of Vanderbilt University\u2019s Program for LGBTI Health, tells RPP the settlement is exciting for its \u201cpotential\u201d to influence other hospitals to take action. The agreement will help educate the health care community about a topic that is \u201cso new,\u201d she says. \u201cThere is not always a good understanding of what discrimination means,\u201d she adds.\n\nThe requirements for training of staff will be critical, Eckstrand points out, so that medical staff know how to respond \u2013\u2013 in a nondiscriminatory way \u2014 once the patient\u2019s status is established. \u201cPeople who are trans know that it is very scary to come out. In health care there is also a privacy issue,\u201d she says, and patients shouldn\u2019t have to reveal this status unless they want to.\n\nACA Provision \u2018Makes a Big Difference\u2019\n\nJill Gaulding, co-founder of the law firm Gender Justice, which is representing the Minnesota patient alleging discrimination, tells RPP she was \u201cpleased to see the measures implemented by the Brooklyn Hospital Center in response to OCR\u2019s investigation.\u201d She adds that \u201cSection 1557 is making a big difference in people\u2019s lives.\u201d\n\nIn court documents, Gaulding argues that the complaint to OCR filed by her client was separate from the lawsuit. Her client, Jacob Rumble, is seeking \u201cmonetary damages [that] are available within this lawsuit, and not the OCR proceedings,\u201d the filings state.\n\nFairview Health System and the emergency room physician who treated Rumble have denied the allegations of discrimination.\n\n\u00a9 2015 by Atlantic Information Services, Inc.
