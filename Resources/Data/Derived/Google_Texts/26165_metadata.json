This time, the agency parodied \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d complete with a fake Donald Trump (and a really bad wig.)But unlike other training videos, \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d spoof, which cost $10,000, was never shown to employees, since the conference was cancelled.\n\nThe video was released at the request of Rep. Charles Boustany, Jr.(R-LA),the chair of the House Ways and Means subcommittee which oversees the IRS, who demanded that the agency release all of its training videos, the time employees spent producing them and the production costs.\n\nMonths ago, I demanded the IRS come clean about the time and money it spent to produce these frivolous videos. While we may have no answers, we do have an endless supply of what appears to be the IRS\u2019 idea of entertainment,\u201d Boustany said.\n\nRELATED: SCANDAL-SCARRED IRS BLEW $50 MILLION ON MEETINGS\n\nBoustany\u2019s request came on the heels of a Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) audit of conference spending that revealed the agency had spent more than $60,000 on two parody videos for one conference in 2010.\n\nThe IRS distanced itself from the \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d spoof saying it was made two years ago under different leadership and \u201cdoes not reflect the stringent policies the IRS now has in place to ensure that all training videos are made at the lowest possible cost and with appropriate content.\"\n\nThe agency added that it has slashed its spending on video production by 90 percent this year and plans to spend about $139,000. That\u2019s compared to the $2.2 million it spent making videos last year.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Remember when the Internal Revenue Service spent thousands of tax dollars on a bizarre", "title": "IRS Wastes Millions on Bizarre Training Videos", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/09/09/IRS-Wastes-Millions-Bizarre-Training-Videos", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Donald%20Trump.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/09/09/IRS-Wastes-Millions-Bizarre-Training-Videos", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Donald%20Trump.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Remember when the Internal Revenue Service spent thousands of tax dollars on a bizarre", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7f36\"", "article_summary": "On Friday, the House Ways and Means Committee introduced another expensive IRS training video that was produced for a 2011 conference.\n)But unlike other training videos, \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d spoof, which cost $10,000, was never shown to employees, since the conference was cancelled.\nMonths ago, I demanded the IRS come clean about the time and money it spent to produce these frivolous videos.\nRemember when the Internal Revenue Service spent thousands of tax dollars on a bizarre Star Trek parody for \u201ctraining purpose?\u201dWell, there\u2019s more where that came from.\nThat\u2019s compared to the $2.2 million it spent making videos last year."}
