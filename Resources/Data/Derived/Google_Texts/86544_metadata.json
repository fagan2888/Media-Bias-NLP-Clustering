The website puts minority enrollment at 5,567, or 17.1 percent, without specifying what constitutes a minority or giving a breakdown.\n\nRacial tensions in Missouri flared last year when a white policeman in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson killed an unarmed young black man and a grand jury brought no charges against the officer. The shooting kindled nationwide soul-searching about the treatment of blacks by law enforcement.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "US, University of Missouri, Turmoil", "pubdate": "2015-11-09T11:43:40", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "Long-simmering protests at the University of Missouri over matters of race and discrimination got a boost over the weekend when at least 30 black football players announced they will not participate in team activities until the university system's president is removed.For...", "title": "Missouri President Quits Over Campus Racism", "url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/US-University-of-Missouri-Turmoil/2015/11/09/id/701232/", "type": "article", "image": "http://www.newsmax.com/CMSPages/GetFile.aspx?guid=38796b0b-83a5-46a5-ba03-c443482ec447&SiteName=Newsmax", "page_id": 85452072376}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/US-University-of-Missouri-Turmoil/2015/11/09/id/701232/", "title": "Missouri President Quits Over Campus Racism", "description": "Long-simmering protests at the University of Missouri over matters of race and discrimination got a boost over the weekend when at least 30 black football players announced they will not participate in team activities until the university system's president is removed.For...", "site": "Newsmax"}, "fb": {"admins": 100002083767056, "app_id": 323020797885219}, "msvalidate.01": "FAF1322EC761685A5DD9344A1C19E82A", "epoch": 1447069420, "google-site-verification": "Jt2HUKgzJJw9VwIQJv31ETytuvNNm5ypTWN6j0nYvHM", "keywords": "US, University of Missouri, Turmoil", "article": {"section": "Newsfront", "published_time": "2015-11-09T11:43:40"}, "original-source": "http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/US-University-of-Missouri-Turmoil/2015/11/09/id/701232/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "description": "Missouri President Quits Over Campus Racism"}, "article_summary": "The University of Missouri's president announced he would step down on Monday after protests over his handling of racial tensions on campus rocked the school.\nProtests on campus have been led by a group called ConcernedStudent1950, which says black students have endured racial slurs and believes white students benefit from favoritism in many aspects of campus life.\nRacial tensions in Missouri flared last year when a white policeman in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson killed an unarmed young black man and a grand jury brought no charges against the officer.\nThe university's black football players had refused to practice or play until President Tim Wolfe stepped down, and some teachers and students had threatened to walk out of class.\nThe high-profile resignation is the latest shock to the state of Missouri, and the United States at large, which has been roiled for the past year or so by racial tensions after police shot and killed an unarmed black teenager in the state."}
