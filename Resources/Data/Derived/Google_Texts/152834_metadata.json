And it goes well beyond that, Malone said.\n\n\u201cOne thing you know every night about Will Barton, he\u2019s going to bring great effort, energy, and he\u2019s going to compete. I just love the makeup that he has, his passion for the game and how hard he plays. I think that\u2019s contagious for the rest of the guys as well.\u201d\n\nThe Nuggets acquired the 6-foot-5 Barton last season at the trade deadline from Portland in exchange for Arron Afflalo, among others.\n\nBarton flourished in his couple of months with the Nuggets and re-signed as a free agent. He got his first start of the season Friday night at Golden State and responded with a jack-of-all-trades line of 19 points, eight rebounds, five assists, and two steals. He was 2-of-4 from beyond the 3-point line.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m starting fresh,\u201d Barton said. \u201cAnd they embraced me when I came here in the trade. So it was like I wanted to come back and get a full year under my belt and show the fans really, really what I can do. I think I teased them last year and it\u2019s just a great feeling, a great vibe from the front office to the players. Everybody wanted me back. So it was just like \u2018Let\u2019s get it done.\u2019 \u201c\n\nHe signed a three-year, $11 million contract and immediately shifted his focus toward making constant improvement.\n\n\u201cWith me it\u2019s just all about staying consistent with my shot, whether it\u2019s threes or pull-up jumpers or things like that,\u201d Barton said. \u201cAnd just getting better overall in my game and evaluate myself, being critical everyday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m one of the guys that\u2019s hardest on myself. So, every game, every day, even practice. No matter if coach tells me I had a great practice I always think there\u2019s something I could have done better.\u201d\n\nMalone has deployed Barton in a number of ways, having him play everything from shooting guard to power forward, even some ballhandling duties.\n\n\u201cI just want to be on the court,\u201d Barton said. \u201cI know I\u2019m a guard at heart, but different lineups, different situations, coach trusts me to go in there and play the four or the three or point, whatever it may be to go out there, get a win and make plays.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s my game \u2014 rebounding, scoring, getting some assists, getting out and running, steals, anything. My job is to go fill the stat sheet up.\u201d\n\nChristopher Dempsey: cdempsey@denverpost.com or @dempseypost\n\nPORTLAND AT DENVER 7 p.m. Monday, ALT; 950 AM\n\nSpotlight on C.J. McCollum:\n\nAn early leader for Most Improved Player in the league, the reality is C.J. McCollum, a former lottery pick, is just getting a chance to play. He\u2019s averaging 34.3 minutes per game this season, a whopping 18 more minutes per game than last season, and he\u2019s making them count with averages of 22.2 points, 4.3 rebounds and 3.5 assists. McCollum is shooting 47.2 percent from the field and 46.2 percent from the 3-point line.\n\nNOTEBOOK\n\nNuggets:\n\nThe Nuggets went small to start the game at Golden State on Friday night, but don\u2019t expect that against Portland, which starts beefy center Mason Plumlee in the middle. The Nuggets started Kenneth Faried at center against smallish Golden State, and inserted Will Barton at small forward. \u2026 Nuggets center Joffrey Lauvergne (back) remains questionable.\n\nTrail Blazers:\n\nThis is the second of a back-to-back for the Trail Blazers, who played at home Sunday against the Detroit Pistons. \u2026 Portland has won eight consecutive games against Denver, half of those at the Pepsi Center. \u2026 Losing LaMarcus Aldridge hasn\u2019t taken the steam out of Portland\u2019s offense, which going into Sunday, was averaging 103 points per game.\n\nChristopher Dempsey, The Denver Post", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Nuggets guard Will Barton fills whatever role Denver needs", "title": "Nuggets guard Will Barton fills whatever role Denver needs", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/11/08/nuggets-guard-will-barton-fills-whatever-role-denver-needs/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151108__Will-Bartonp1.jpg", "height": 470}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151108__Will-Bartonp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-08T23:06:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-20T04:56:17+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cOne thing you know every night about Will Barton, he\u2019s going to bring great effort, energy, and he\u2019s going to compete.\n\u201cThat\u2019s my game \u2014 rebounding, scoring, getting some assists, getting out and running, steals, anything.\n\u2026 Nuggets center Joffrey Lauvergne (back) remains questionable.\nNuggets coach Michael Malone calls Will Barton his jack of all trades, and a quick look at his statistics shows why.\nBarton flourished in his couple of months with the Nuggets and re-signed as a free agent."}
