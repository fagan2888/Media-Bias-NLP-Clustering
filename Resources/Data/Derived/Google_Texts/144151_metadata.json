Cupp has come out swinging against progressive atheists.\n\nIn a clip (see above) for CNN\u2019s \u201cCrossfire,\u201d she argues that conservative atheists are \u201cbetter\u201d than liberal nonbelievers. What\u2019s more, Cupp says, those on the right respect and tolerate atheists more than liberals do.\n\nShe\u2019s wrong, and here are three reasons why.\n\nFact: Atheists are still political outcasts.\n\n\u201cIt seems like there\u2019s this idea perpetuated by atheists that atheists are somehow disenfranchised or left out of the political process,\u201d Cupp says. \u201cI just don\u2019t find that to be the case.\u201d\n\nSurvey data contradict Cupp.\n\nFor instance, a 2014 Pew Research study found that Americans are less likely to vote for an atheist presidential candidate than any other survey category\u2014even if they share that candidate\u2019s political views.\n\nFaring better than atheists: candidates who have engaged in extramarital affairs and those with zero political experience.\n\nAnd unless she recently had a change of heart, Cupp herself falls in line with the majority of Americans. In 2012 she said, \u201cI would never vote for an atheist president. Ever.\u201d\n\nWhile atheists are making political inroads, we\u2019re also still on the margins in a number of ways. Cupp concludes the clip by saying, \u201cI think our atheists are better than yours.\u201d\n\nApparently they\u2019re still not good enough to be president.\n\nFact: Conservatives are hostile toward atheists.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s another myth: that conservatism is somehow hostile to atheism,\u201d Cupp says. \u201cI\u2019m a conservative atheist (and) I\u2019ve felt very welcomed.\u201d\n\nBut Cupp goes beyond arguing that conservatives broadly welcome nontheists\u2014she also argues that liberals are less accepting of atheists.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d go so far as to say conservatism is far more intellectually honest and respectful of atheism than liberalism has been,\u201d she says.\n\nAgain, Pew\u2019s surveys suggest otherwise.\n\nWhile the number of people who say they wouldn't vote for an atheist candidate sits at 70% among Republicans, that number drops to 42% among Democrats. (\u201cProgressive,\u201d \u201cliberal,\u201d and \u201cDemocrat\u201d certainly aren\u2019t synonyms, but there is overlap.)\n\nOf course, conservative hostility toward atheists goes beyond voting for a presidential candidate.\n\nEarlier this year, the group American Atheists announced plans to sponsor a table at CPAC, the country\u2019s largest annual gathering of conservatives. But within hours, after a number of conservatives spoke out against their inclusion, they were promptly uninvited.\n\nMany of the most prominent anti-atheist voices\u2014including Sarah Palin, Erick Erickson, Mike Huckabee and Newt Gingrich\u2014are conservative politicians and commentators, and I have yet to hear many other conservatives (Cupp included) condemn their anti-atheist remarks.\n\nOn the other hand, a number of political moderates and liberals have welcomed nontheists.\n\nIn 2009, for example, President Barack Obama became the first commander in chief to reference nonbelievers in an inaugural address. The next year, his administration became the first to meet with representatives from the atheist community.\n\nOverall, a much larger percentage of the religiously unaffiliated (a category that includes many atheists) identify as liberal than conservative.\n\nIn 2012, Pew reported that 61 percent of nonreligious Americans are either Democrat or lean Democrat, while just 27 percent identify as or lean Republican.\n\nIf it truly were the case that conservatives are much more \u201crespectful of atheism,\u201d I would expect to see more Republican atheists.\n\nFact: Most liberals respect religious diversity.\n\n\u201cConservatives appreciate an intellectual diversity,\u201d Cupp says. \u201cIn contrast, on the left it seems as though there is this knee-jerk embrace of what is more like a militant hostility to faith.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019ve been paying attention to Cupp\u2019s arguments so far, this one should be a bit confusing. Which is it? Are liberals hostile toward atheists\u2014or the religious? (Or are liberals just hostile toward everyone?)\n\nBut religious diversity is actually significantly greater among Democrats\u2014for example, Pew reported in 2011 that just 11% of Muslims affiliate with Republicans, while 60% identify as or lean Democrat.\n\nBy contrast, as much as 74% of GOP voters identify as Christian, according to recent surveys and polls.\n\nFinally, Cupp lifts up self-identified progressive Bill Maher\u2014who has said, among other things, that religious believers have a \u201cneurological disorder\u201d\u2014as an example of liberal intolerance.\n\nI should give credit where it\u2019s due: Cupp is partially right here. Maher\u2019s take on religion is problematic and should be condemned.\n\nBut his views certainly aren\u2019t representative of most of the progressive atheists I know. Suggesting that Maher speaks for atheism is like saying Pat Robertson represents all of Christianity.\n\nIn the end, I\u2019m not arguing that progressives are perfect. We have plenty of our own issues and aren\u2019t as welcoming of atheists or some believers as we could be.\n\nBut to say that we\u2019re less tolerant of religious and nonreligious diversity than conservatives? Well, that\u2019s just hard to believe.\n\nChris Stedman is Executive Director of the Yale Humanist Community, author of \"Faitheist,\" and atheist columnist for Religion News Service.
