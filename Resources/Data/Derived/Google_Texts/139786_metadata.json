It\u2019s open enrollment again for Obamacare, this time for 2015 coverage. Analysts will carefully count the new enrollments, and the number will become another talking point for proponents of the law who promised that it would significantly expand private health insurance coverage.\n\nYet that\u2019s not how the law is shaping up in reality. Rather than helping those who lack insurance, the law\u2019s far greater impact has been to shift already-insured people into lower-quality, government-controlled health plans by massively expanding Medicaid (the dysfunctional insurance program meant for those with the lowest incomes) and by offering Obamacare plans through exchanges, which mimic the worst characteristics of the Medicaid program.\n\nConsider the numbers: In the first two quarters of 2014, 6.1 million people were added to the Medicaid program. Another net 2.5 million people enrolled in private health insurance during that time, but the new plans available in the Obamacare exchanges \u2013 while technically private \u2013 look and function more like Medicaid plans with limited networks, low physician reimbursement, and high public costs.\n\n[SEE: Political Cartoons on Obamacare]\n\nA McKinsey and Co. study shows that 70 percent of Obamacare plans offer \u201cnarrow\u201d or \u201cultra-narrow\u201d networks. (Compared to 23 percent of large-group non-Obamacare plans.) This means that, because there are few providers available in these new plans, patients face significant barriers to actually receiving the care they need. They are technically insured, but face restricted access to care.\n\nThis is direct result of Obamacare\u2019s requirements. Because the law requires that all insurance plans offer certain benefits, and because the law regulates how insurers can share costs with consumers, insurance companies have no way to cut costs other than on the back end, by limiting which providers are \u201cin-network\u201d and by reducing reimbursements to those providers.\n\nIn a recent nationwide survey of doctors, 23.5 percent said that they would not accept Obamacare plans at all. While some doctors surveyed were never asked to participate in Obamacare plans (perhaps because of the narrow networks), others cited low and uncertain reimbursements as their main reason for avoiding Obamacare plans. These are the same reasons why many physicians have been avoiding the Medicaid program for years. Even if doctors choose to participate in Medicaid or Obamacare, they may cap the number of patients they accept in these plans, to protect themselves financially.\n\n[READ: Taking Aim at Obamacare's Edges]\n\n\u201cThe exchanges have become very much like Medicaid,\u201d said Andrew Kleinman, president of the Medical Society of the State of New York, as quoted in USA Today. Some health policy wonks have referred to these plans as \u201cMedicaid Plus.\u201d\n\nAnd like Medicaid, the Obamacare exchange plans come with enormous public costs. In fact, these two coverage-expanding provisions come with the highest price tags in the law: the federal government expects to spend $792 billion on the Medicaid expansion and about $1 trillion on the exchanges in the next 10 years.\n\nMedicaid participants do not pay a premium, and most exchange enrollees pay only part of theirs. Fully 86 percent of exchange enrollees pay subsidized rates.\n\nSo essentially, Obamacare has added enormously to public health spending, and as a result, more people have lower-quality health plans. McKinsey and Co. also reports that only 26 percent of the 2014 exchange enrollments were of those who were previously uninsured.\n\n[READ: Jonathan Gruber's Got a Point]\n\nIt didn\u2019t have to be this way. A far better method for expanding coverage would have been to directly subsidize the consumers who need it \u2013 rather than subsidizing the insurance companies who carry them \u2013 and then to allow those consumers to spend the subsidy on the insurance plan of their choice. There\u2019s no need for government-run exchanges, and there\u2019s no need for the federal government to promulgate onerous regulations and benefit mandates on all participating plans.\n\nNot surprisingly, this should be the solution in Medicaid too. Instead of a government-run insurance program, direct subsidies should be targeted at those who are truly unable to afford health care, so that they can take those dollars into a competitive market and buy high-quality insurance plans that don\u2019t limit their access to physicians.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Op-Ed [Opinion]", "title": "Obamacare Exchanges Are Looking Like Dysfunctional Medicaid", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Obamacare's exchanges are looking a lot like Medicaid, and that's not good for anyone.", "title": "Medicaid Wrapped In an Obamacare Bow", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2014/12/15/obamacare-exchanges-are-looking-like-dysfunctional-medicaid", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/6c/9f79091cf1feba849e90f3c3d8f139/media:a401edf39c264e539db2ba7556bb6cdbHealthOverhaulOpenEnrollment.JPEG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "Obamacare's exchanges are looking a lot like Medicaid, and that's not good for anyone.", "card": "summary", "title": "Obamacare Exchanges Are Looking Like Dysfunctional Medicaid"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "opinion", "date_published": "Dec. 15, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Hadley Heath Manning,Affordable Care Act,health care reform,public health,picks,Op-Ed [Opinion]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Obamacare's exchanges are looking a lot like Medicaid, and that's not good for anyone."}, "article_summary": "While some doctors surveyed were never asked to participate in Obamacare plans (perhaps because of the narrow networks), others cited low and uncertain reimbursements as their main reason for avoiding Obamacare plans.\nSome health policy wonks have referred to these plans as \u201cMedicaid Plus.\u201dAnd like Medicaid, the Obamacare exchange plans come with enormous public costs.\n[SEE: Political Cartoons on Obamacare]A McKinsey and Co. study shows that 70 percent of Obamacare plans offer \u201cnarrow\u201d or \u201cultra-narrow\u201d networks.\nConsider the numbers: In the first two quarters of 2014, 6.1 million people were added to the Medicaid program.\nIn a recent nationwide survey of doctors, 23.5 percent said that they would not accept Obamacare plans at all."}
