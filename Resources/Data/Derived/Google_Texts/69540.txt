Hours after the initial 6:50 a.m. call, firefighter continued spraying water onto the home from their ladder trucks as flames lept up the side of two chimney.

Greenville Fire Rescue Chief Eric Griffin said the fire was coming from back left side of home near a bedroom and that a lack of water in the area made it difficult to get the fire under control.

"Having one hydrant presented a major problem today," Griffin said. "We had to make some adjustments to contain the fire to one part of the house."

Griffin added one person was home at the time the fire started.

Neighbors said that woman ran from the house asking for someone to call 911. She escaped the fire uninjured.

There is no word yet on a cause for the blaze, but fire investigators were on scene.
