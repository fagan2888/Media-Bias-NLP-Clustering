When they do, they\u2019re not sure what to say, according to a national poll released Thursday.\n\nSuch discussions are becoming more important as baby boomers reach their golden years. By 2030, an estimated 72 million Americans will be 65 or over, nearly one-fifth of the U.S. population.\n\nMedicare now reimburses doctors $86 to discuss end-of-life care in an office visit that covers topics such as hospice, living wills and do-not-resuscitate orders. Known as \u201cadvance care planning,\u201d the conversations can also be held in a hospital.\n\nPayment for such discussions was initially included in the Affordable Care Act, but removed because of the controversy over so-called death panels. Medicare ultimately changed its policy, independently of Obamacare, to allow reimbursement for the end-of-life planning sessions.\n\nThe poll of 736 primary care doctors and specialists, including 202 in California, examined their views on advance care planning and end-of-life conversations with patients. Among the findings:\n\nWhile 75 percent of doctors said Medicare reimbursement makes it more likely they\u2019d have advance care planning discussions, only about 14 percent said they had actually billed Medicare for those visits.\n\nThree quarters also believe it\u2019s their responsibility to initiate end-of-life conversations.\n\nFewer than one-third reported any formal training on end-of-life discussions with patients and their families.\n\nMore than half said they had not discussed end-of-life care with their own physicians.\n\nThe survey was commissioned by The John A. Hartford Foundation, the California Health Care Foundation and Cambia Health Foundation. (California Healthline is an editorially independent publication of the California Health Care Foundation.)\n\nThe general survey has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.6 percentage points. For the internist/primary care provider sample, margin is plus or minus 4.5 percentage points. For specialists, plus or minus 6.0 points.\n\nPatients and their families increasingly want to talk about end-of-life care with their physicians well before facing a terminal illness, studies have shown. Most also want to die at home rather than in a hospital, although cultural differences influence end-of-life preferences.\n\nPolicy analysts are urging more end-of-life conversations not just to accommodate patients\u2019 desires, but to save money on aggressive medical interventions that patients and their families don\u2019t want and that won\u2019t prolong life.\n\nA recent study found nearly 40 percent of American patients dying with cancer received at least one chemotherapy treatment in the six months before they died, more than in six other countries studied. An average of about $18,500 was spent on U.S. hospital costs for patients in their last six months.\n\nNearly a quarter of the physicians in the national poll said that the electronic health records they\u2019re required to use don\u2019t have a place to include patients\u2019 end-of-life preferences. Even when electronic health records signaled that a patient had an advance care directive, nearly a third of doctors reported they couldn\u2019t access its actual contents.\n\nAnd doctors who received their medical training years ago say they rarely focused on how to talk to patients about end-of-life care, although medical education is improving in that regard.\n\nPhysicians in large medical systems may find more support than those in private practice. At Kaiser Permanente in Northern California, physicians receive training in end-of-life discussions and have time to carry them out, said Dr. Ruma Kumar, the HMO\u2019s regional medical director of supportive care services.\n\nKaiser Permanente looks to nurse practitioners, registered nurses and social workers to work with patients on various stages of what the HMO calls \u201clife care planning.\u201d The HMO also offers a website to guide people through the process.\n\nKumar said Kaiser encourages both doctors and patients to think of end-of-life planning \u201cas a routine part of care, just like you\u2019d get a mammogram or colon cancer screening.\u201d\n\nThis story was produced by Kaiser Health News, which publishes California Healthline, a service of the California Health Care Foundation.
