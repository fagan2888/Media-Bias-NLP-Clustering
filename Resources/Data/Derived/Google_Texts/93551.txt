Lockett and Warner are challenging the constitutionality of the state law allowing the state Corrections Department to shield its source of pentobarbital, a barbiturate used in Oklahoma's lethal injection process, and whether or not a change allowing the use of pentobarbital was a violation of the Oklahoma Administrative Procedures Act.
