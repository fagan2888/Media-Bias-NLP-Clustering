Snow should be falling throughout the state by nightfall.\n\nDavid Robinson, the state climatologist at Rutgers University, said the way low pressure waves trek across the state would affect whether the storm is merely an annoyance or something more formidable in the state\u2019s northern regions.\n\n\u201cIf the cold air comes in too strong it\u2019s going to push the snow to the south,\u201d he said. \u201cWe won\u2019t know how this thing behaves until these waves of low pressure get closer to the East Coast.\u201d\n\nThe Weather Service has mapped a snow band extending southwest from the middle of both Ocean and Burlington counties and into Salem and Cumberland counties, and Philadelphia and Delaware.\n\n\u201cIt may not amount to more than a two- to four-inch nuisance\u201d in northern New Jersey, Robinson said.\n\nBut at least 8 inches of snow are expected along the snow band, which stretches from Monmouth and Middlesex counties to points west.\n\n\u201cIn South Jersey they\u2019re looking for 10 to 14\u201d inches, Robinson said. The Weather Service cautions that \u201csignificant amounts\u201d of sleet could fall just south of the snow band and establish a thin sheet of ice on the ground as today\u2019s temperatures fall.\n\nThe coast will also be buffeted by wind gusts that could reach up to 40 mph through Monday, when the snowfall will end gradually from northwest to southeast, the Weather Service said.\n\nRegardless of precipitation, near-record cold will have settled over the state Monday night, the agency said.\n\nOvernight lows will hover in the single digits and teens, although winds could make it feel much colder.\n\nTuesday should be slightly warmer, the Weather Service said, with Wednesday becoming cloudy but warmer. Thursday, though, will bring another low pressure system, this time from the Gulf of Mexico, and possibly more snow and rain.\n\nStar-Ledger staff writer David Giambusso contributed to this report", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "'@mobile','@river','deep-freeze','nj-snow','nj-weather'", "title": "Stormy Sunday: Some parts of New Jersey could get as much as 14 inches of snow", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Stormy Sunday: Some parts of New Jersey could get as much as 14 inches of snow\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2014/03/stormy_sunday_some_new_jersey_could_get_as_much_as_14_inches.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2014/03/snow-forecast-weather-jerseyjpgpng-12c831fb7d5766e4.png\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"12329391\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-03-02T00:29:14Z\", \"author\": \"Richard Khavkine\", \"tags\": [\"@mobile\",\"@river\",\"deep-freeze\",\"nj-snow\",\"nj-weather\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.nj.com/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2014/03/14393432-thumb_square_large.png", "description": "Meteorologists are saying as much as 14 inches of snow could fall in southern New Jersey by the time the storm moves on late Monday.", "card": "summary", "site": "@njdotcom"}, "article_date_updated": "Sunday, March 02, 2014,  1:59 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.nj.com/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2014/03/snow-forecast-weather-jerseyjpgpng-12c831fb7d5766e4.png\", \"author_name\": \"RichardKhavkine\", \"author_nickname\": \"Richard Khavkine\", \"author_id\": \"9827199\", \"source_blog_name\": \"New Jersey Real-Time News\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "Meteorologists are saying as much as 14 inches of snow could fall in southern New Jersey by the time the storm moves on late Monday.", "title": "Stormy Sunday: Some parts of New Jersey could get as much as 14 inches of snow", "url": "http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2014/03/stormy_sunday_some_new_jersey_could_get_as_much_as_14_inches.html", "image": "http://media.nj.com/design/alpha/img/logo_njo.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Saturday, March 01, 2014,  7:31 PM", "article_author": "Richard Khavkine", "Description": "Meteorologists are saying as much as 14 inches of snow could fall in southern New Jersey by the time the storm moves on late Monday."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde6a3\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIn South Jersey they\u2019re looking for 10 to 14\u201d inches, Robinson said.\nThursday, though, will bring another low pressure system, this time from the Gulf of Mexico, and possibly more snow and rain.\n\u201cIt may not amount to more than a two- to four-inch nuisance\u201d in northern New Jersey, Robinson said.\nBut at least 8 inches of snow are expected along the snow band, which stretches from Monmouth and Middlesex counties to points west.\nTuesday should be slightly warmer, the Weather Service said, with Wednesday becoming cloudy but warmer."}
