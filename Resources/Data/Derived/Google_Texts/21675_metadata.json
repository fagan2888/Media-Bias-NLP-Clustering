(AP Photo/Bob Leverone)\n\nThe Clemson football program has already won the publicity national championship for 2015. The undefeated Tigers were No. 1 wire-to-wire over the six weeks of the College Football Playoff rankings, hosted the ESPN \u201cGameDay\u201d crew and made three Sports Illustrated covers and the Heisman Trophy show.\n\nIf Dabo Swinney isn\u2019t winning a Coach of the Year award, he is hosting a stadium-sized pizza party.\n\n\u201cPeople say athletics is the front porch of a university and Clemson\u2019s front porch looks pretty good right now,\u201d said Dr. Raymond Sauer, president of the North American Association of Sports Economists and an Economics professor at Clemson. \u201cThat kind of positive publicity is pretty hard to purchase. It\u2019s hard to quantify that but it gives the university a national presence, not just a regional presence.\u201d\n\nBut while the 13-0 run to a College Football Playoff date with No. 4 Oklahoma in the Dec. 31 Orange Bowl no doubt gives the football program a boost, it doesn\u2019t guarantee the athletic department upcoming annual profits. And, contrary to popular belief, the university as a whole might feel little if any positive financial impact.\n\nThe short-term key for Clemson? Leverage.\n\nLong-term key? Keep winning.\n\nFootball success comes with only a few guarantees.\n\nAmong them:\n\n\u2018Self-contained\u2019 profit, and loss.\n\nDeshaun Watson, quarterback and Heisman finalist, has been worth more than $2 million to Clemson this season, said Dr. Robert Brown, a professor of Economics at the University of California at San Marcos who has studied college athlete values for two decades. He bases his theory on a star player\u2019s impact on things like ticket sales, TV revenue and game concessions.\n\n\u201cAs a Heisman Trophy candidate and with Clemson having the year that they\u2019re having, (Watson\u2019s) value is probably well beyond $2 million,\u201d Brown said.\n\nOf course, that\u2019s just the tip of the Clemson cash haul. Just for making a semifinal playoff game, the Tigers earn $6 million for the ACC and stand to make much more money under the bowl revenue distribution plan. Clemson home attendance (81,751 average) ranked No. 14 nationally and was almost equal to 2014 (81,752).\n\nClemson, USC red ink\n\nMost athletic departments plow their football profits back into the program or other sports upgrades. That\u2019s not such a bad thing \u2014 new facilities, new planes for recruiting, various upgrades.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a bonanza for the university as a whole, per se,\u201d Sauer said. \u201cThe money side of things is mostly self-contained to the athletic department. That\u2019s a truism that goes back a long way in college athletics.\u201d\n\nBut as a recent Washington Post story shows, it rarely means black ink for athletic departments or schools even as revenues soar, mostly thanks to TV money. The 25 Power Five conference athletic departments that ran deficits in 2014 included Clemson ($3 million) and South Carolina ($2.8 million).\n\nThe impact beyond athletics is minimal or murky.\n\nIn theory, more athletic success equals more exposure for a school, which leads to more applicants, which usually means better applicants, and smarter students can lead to valuable prestige for academic departments.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s certainly the story. It\u2019s possible,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThere has been some research on that but there hasn\u2019t been a consensus to show the direct connection there. Does it translate into things like research grants? Probably not.\u201d\n\nStill, there are positives.\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s a Final Four run in basketball or an undefeated football season, you get a bigger applicant pool,\u201d Sauer said. \u201cThat allows you to either be more selective, or if you\u2019re trying to grow your student numbers a little bit, you can do that without having a drop-off in quality. That part of the equation is well-studied.\u201d\n\n\u2018Have to keep working\u2019\n\nStriking when the ranking is hot is critical, but doesn\u2019t guarantee more winning.\n\n\u201cThe best way to leverage success is to develop donors, hit them when excitement is high and passions are keen,\u201d said Dr. Thomas H. Regan, a professor in the University of South Carolina\u2019s Department of Sport and Entertainment Management. \u201cBoth philanthropic and transactional development have to be worked to gain maximum financial benefit.\u201d\n\nClemson is on the right track with that lifeblood tandem, donations and recruiting. Swinney helped break ground last month for a long-planned $55 million football complex \u2014 aka Dabo World \u2014 that includes a mini version of The Hill. As if Clemson recruiting for the Class of 2016 wasn\u2019t going well enough, Swinney this month got commitments from two of the top quarterbacks in the Class of 2017, Hunter Johnson of Brownsburg, Ind., and Chase Brice of Loganville, Ga.\n\nAs everyone in sports knows, maintaining excellence isn\u2019t easy. South Carolina skidded to a 3-8 football record this year, two seasons after a third straight 11-2 finish.\n\n\u201cYou have to keep working,\u201d Sauer said. \u201cIf you can sustain an excellent program, that will feed back in a number of ways. No question, their apparel and licensing revenues will increase. For the long term, they will probably be able to get better deals on those contracts if they can continue to be in the limelight.\u201d\n\nClemson is two games away from a different kind of limelight.\n\n\u201cA championship will bring a national exposure to Clemson much greater than the first (1981) national championship,\u201d Regan said.\n\nWhich will likely lead to more perks inside the football complex and a new athletic department jet, though not necessarily any new fountains, greenhouse grants or reduced tuition.\n\nFollow Gene Sapakoff on Twitter @sapakoff", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Sapakoff: Myths, deficits and monetizing Clemson\u2019s No. 1 run, Sports, \r\nSportsClemson, \r\nFP LatestNews, \r\nrsssports, \r\nGene Sapakoff, \r\nGene Sapakoff, CFP,Clemson,College Football Playoff,Dabo Swinney,Deshaun Watson,Dr. Raymond Sauer,Dr. Robert Brown,Dr. Thomas Regan,Oklahoma Sooners,Orange Bowl", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "The Clemson football program has already won the publicity national championship for 2015.
