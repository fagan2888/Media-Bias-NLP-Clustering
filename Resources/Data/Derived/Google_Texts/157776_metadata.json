And we got it.\u201d\n\nBut in Tehran, Iran\u2019s top leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Saturday the historic nuclear deal won\u2019t change Iran\u2019s policy towards the \u201carrogant\u201d United States. He said Iran will continue to support its allies in the Middle East including the Lebanese Hezbollah, Palestinian resistance groups and the Syrian government.\n\nSEE ALSO: Iran\u2019s hardliners take to Tehran for holiday march: \u2018America is the Great Satan\u2019\n\nHis remarks were greeted by customary chants of \u201cDeath to America,\u201d a feature of public ceremonies since the Islamic revolution of 1979 which toppled the U.S.-backed shah.\n\n\u201cOur policies toward the arrogant U.S. government will not change,\u201d Khamenei said at a prayer gathering in Tehran marking the end of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan.\n\nThe agreement among the U.S. and other world powers is aimed at curbing Iran\u2019s nuclear program in return for lifting international and U.S. economic sanctions. The president said it\u2019s the surest way to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon.\n\nMany Republicans and some Democrats in Congress are expressing concern that the accord doesn\u2019t require Iran to dismantle its nuclear facilities and that prompt international inspections are not guaranteed. More than two-thirds of all House Republicans have already signed onto a resolution disapproving of the agreement, with the measure likely to get a vote in early September.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz, Texas Republican and a candidate for the GOP presidential nomination in 2016, said he\u2019ll block Mr. Obama\u2019s diplomatic nominees and hold up State Department authorizing legislation unless Congress can consider the accord before the U.N. Security Council acts on it.\n\nCongress has 60 days to review the deal, and Mr. Obama has vowed to veto any legislation that would overturn the agreement. The president said he\u2019s confident he has the stronger argument.\n\n\u201cI welcome all scrutiny. I fear no questions,\u201d he said in his address.\n\nMr. Obama said he\u2019ll also make his case on Tuesday at the annual Veterans of Foreign Wars convention in Pittsburgh.\n\n\u201cAs commander-in-chief, I make no apology for keeping this country safe and secure through the hard work of diplomacy over the easy rush to war,\u201d the president said. \u201cNobody understands the true cost of war better than those who\u2019ve actually served in this country\u2019s uniform.\u201d\n\nAdministration officials say it would be \u201cdevastating\u201d for U.S. standing in the world if Congress rejects the accord. The president said killing the agreement also would be dangerous.\n\n\u201cWithout this deal, there would be no limits on Iran\u2019s nuclear program,\u201d he said. \u201cThere would be no monitoring, no inspections. The sanctions we rallied the world to impose would unravel. Iran could move closer to a nuclear weapon.\u201d\n\n\u2022 This article is based in part on wire-service reports.", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama said Saturday that opponents of his administration's nuclear deal with Iran are engaging in \"overheated and often dishonest arguments\" to derail the accord.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "President Obama said Saturday that opponents of his administration\u2019s nuclear deal with Iran are engaging in \u201coverheated and often dishonest arguments\u201d to derail the accord.", "title": "Obama says Iran nuke deal will make world safer while Iranians chant \u2018death to America\u2019", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jul/18/obama-says-iran-nuke-deal-will-make-world-safer-wh/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/07/06/KerryObama.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/07/06/KerryObama.jpg", "description": "President Obama said Saturday that opponents of his administration's nuclear deal with Iran are engaging in \"overheated and often dishonest arguments\" to derail the accord.", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama says Iran nuke deal will make world safer while Iranians chant &"}, "Author": "Dave Boyer", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Iran, Ali Khamenei, Congress"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThis deal will make America and the world safer and more secure,\u201d Mr. Obama said in his weekly address.\nMr. Obama said he\u2019ll also make his case on Tuesday at the annual Veterans of Foreign Wars convention in Pittsburgh.\nPresident Obama said Saturday that opponents of his administration\u2019s nuclear deal with Iran are engaging in \u201coverheated and often dishonest arguments\u201d to derail the accord.\nAnd we got it.\u201dBut in Tehran, Iran\u2019s top leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Saturday the historic nuclear deal won\u2019t change Iran\u2019s policy towards the \u201carrogant\u201d United States.\nCongress has 60 days to review the deal, and Mr. Obama has vowed to veto any legislation that would overturn the agreement."}
