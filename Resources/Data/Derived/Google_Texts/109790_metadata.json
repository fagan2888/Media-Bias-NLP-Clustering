Young almost single-handedly lassoed Oklahoma State by scoring 23 of his team\u2019s 26 points during a nine-minute stretch on either side of halftime \u2014 lifting the Ducks from four down to eight up \u2014 and tied it off with a dunk as vicious as anything his dad, Michael Young, threw down during his days as a member of Phi Slamma Jamma.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just my teammates trusting me,\u201d Young, the Pac-12 Conference player of the year, said after a 79-73 win. \u201cThey found me, got me the ball, set good screens, and I knocked down open shots. But I really commend my team for getting me open.\u201d\n\nActually, just convincing Young to bring his talents to Eugene was no small feat. He played his high school ball at Houston\u2019s Yates High \u2014 like his father \u2014 and then began his college career just down the road at the University of Houston, where Michael Young made his name as a player and was working as director of basketball operations. After his sophomore year, both Youngs left the Cougars program for different reasons. Joseph, already a rising star and intrigued by the run-and-gun style at Oregon and across the Pac-12, lit out for the Northwest and became an instant hit with the Ducks.\n\nYoung\u2019s heroics came on the heels two other notable father-son connections from Thursday. That\u2019s when UCLA\u2019s Bryce Alford channeled father Steve\u2019s sharpshooting skills and made nine of 11 three-pointers against SMU, including hoisting a final attempt resulting in the controversial goaltending call that decided the game. Then there was R.J. Hunter\u2019s last-second deep 3-pointer for Georgia State that sealed the upset over Baylor and gave his father, Ron, his greatest coaching win yet.\n\nFor all that, a good pedigree is not an absolute guarantee of victory. Witness Wyoming\u2019s Larry Nance Jr., whose father, Larry Sr., was a star at Clemson and in the NBA. But his son\u2019s Cowboys got thumped by Northern Iowa, a loss that left the senior center fighting back tears and so devastated at playing his last game that Nance couldn\u2019t speak.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Who\u2019s your daddy?
