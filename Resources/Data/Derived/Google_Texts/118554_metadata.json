Not when Black people like Kevin McGill are still being harassed and imprisoned and it all appears to be sanctioned by the state.\n\nAccording to ABC News 7:\n\n\u201cA sanitation worker in an Atlanta suburb is behind bars for getting to work too early. Kevin McGill was sentenced to 30 days in jail for violating a Sandy Springs ordinance that says workers can only haul trash between the hours of 7am and 7pm. McGill was cited for picking up the trash just after 5am one morning. He says he could not believe when the prosecutor asked the judge for the maximum punishment. \u201cI was stunned. I didn\u2019t know what to think. I was shocked,\u201d he said. The prosecutor, Bill Riley, makes no apologies for locking sanitation workers up. \u201cFines don\u2019t seem to work,\u201d Riley said. He says they are a nuisance to sleeping residents. McGill had only been on the job for three months. Now he has to spend the next 14 weekends in jail, while he works during the week\u2026 after 7am.\u201d\n\nThis small town Georgia prosecutor sounds like a terrorist, who is using the justice system to inflict as much personal retribution and paternalism his little evil heart can dish. And it is not only costing the taxpayers (who will foot a sizable portion of McGill\u2019s stay in county), but also McGill who more than likely be hit with not only court fees, but might now have to explain to all his future employers his brief time in jail \u2013 that\u2019s if he can get past the application process.\n\nOf course, the bigger tragedy here is that these stories about how poor (and that includes the working poor) and Black people are abused by law enforcement and our court system are not unusual in America. The Ferguson report is proof of that. And yet McGill\u2019s story is treated incidentally and told almost in a humorous fashion. There is no expos\u00e9 into the local district attorney\u2019s office or questions asked about the actual ethics of his prosecution or even commentary about the larger question of prosecutorial abuse. That aspect of the story, and stories like it, are always glossed over. Always.\n\nJust like in President Obama\u2019s Selma speech.\n\nIn most of the mainstream press, President Obama drew particular high praises for beautifully articulating both the spirit and struggle associated with the Civil Rights era. In particular, he points how marchers were often condemned as \u201ccommunists, half-breeds, outside agitators, sexual and moral degenerates, and worse \u2013 everything but the name their parents gave them.\u201d\n\nLikewise:\n\n\u201cAs is true across the landscape of American history, we cannot examine this moment in isolation. The march on Selma was part of a broader campaign that spanned generations; the leaders that day part of a long line of heroes. We gather here to celebrate them. We gather here to honor the courage of ordinary Americans willing to endure billy clubs and the chastening rod; tear gas and the trampling hoof; men and women who despite the gush of blood and splintered bone would stay true to their North Star and keep marching toward justice.\u201d\n\nAnd yet many would argue that the march has continued on into Ferguson, New York, L.A., Cleveland and other points ravaged by police abuse and violence \u2013 an issue which only seems to have gotten considerably worse over the last 50 years. In fact, more Black men are in prisons today than there were in the time pre-Civil Rights era.\n\nIn the speech President Obama acknowledges these injustices, as well as the findings in the Ferguson report. He also reminds us that these injustices are \u201c woefully familiar\u201d and \u201cevoked the kind of abuse and disregard for citizens that spawned the Civil Rights Movement.\u201d\n\nBut in the next breath, President Obama then argues that things have gotten better since Selma. And that Ferguson is not \u201cendemic, or sanctioned by law and custom like it was pre-Civil Rights Movement.\u201d More specifically he tells the crowd:\n\n\u201cWe do a disservice to the cause of justice by intimating that bias and discrimination are immutable, or that racial division is inherent to America. If you think nothing\u2019s changed in the past fifty years, ask somebody who lived through the Selma or Chicago or L.A. of the Fifties. Ask the female CEO who once might have been assigned to the secretarial pool if nothing\u2019s changed. Ask your gay friend if it\u2019s easier to be out and proud in America now than it was thirty years ago. To deny this progress \u2013 our progress \u2013 would be to rob us of our own agency; our responsibility to do what we can to make America better.\u201d\n\nIt is true that we have Black CEOs running Fortune 500 companies and gay Black friends who are now able to say they\u2019re gay openly, but the real question is how many of those Black CEOS and gay Black friends can walk the streets freely without threat or fear of harassment by the police based solely off the color of their skin? I bet if we posed that question to the same groups, very few would speak of progress.\n\nThe point here is that what happened in Selma was more than about getting across the bridge to register to vote, just like what happened Ferguson is more than about a single kid who was mercilessly killed in the street by an overzealous police officer. But rather those marches were an indictment of an entire predatory system, which not only views Black people as subhuman. but also actively treats Black people like profit and revenue.\n\nThe same predatory system of oppression, which created peonage and sent many of our ancestors post-slavery and Reconstruction right back into bondage. The same predatory system, which created literary tests, taxes and engaged in flat-out fraud to deny people\u2019s constitutional right to vote. And the same predatory system, which today continues to punish and exploit people like McGill, whose only real crime is being Black under the jurisdiction of a white man with an ax to grind.\n\nWhat happened in Selma and in Ferguson wasn\u2019t just about all colors of people uniting and fighting to change America. But both those narratives were and are also about state-sponsored violence. We should speak that. We should speak that entire truth.\n\nIn the speech, President Obama spoke favorably of the young people throughout history, particularly the young people in Soweto, Burma, Tusnia and the kids in Ferguson who\u2019d risen up in similar fashion to demand change. He also acknowledged that true progress, \u201crequires the occasional disruption, the willingness to speak out for what\u2019s right and shake up the status quo.\u201d\n\nAnd yet as President Obama waxed poetic about the bravery of the young disruptors of the status quo, he fails to mention the responsibility his office holds in disruption of this status quo and facilitating progress. Instead he treats himself as an outsider and an observer pointing out everybody else\u2019s burdens and responsibilities. Almost as if to say, you rainbow-colored bunch of young people keep on marching and I guess someone will eventually come along and be bold about things. Someday.\n\nAs clearly, it will not be now and with this president. As pointed out by Dr. Stacey Patton in Dame Magazine:\n\n\u201cAs MSNBC reports, Obama fielded a question about why the DOJ didn\u2019t charge Wilson by saying that, \u201che had \u2018complete confidence and [stood] fully behind\u2019 the DOJ\u2019s decision regarding Wilson, whom said he killed Brown in self-defense. \u201cWe may never know exactly what happened, but Officer Wilson\u2014like anyone else who is charged with a crime\u2014benefits from due process and a reasonable-doubt standard,\u201d Obama said. \u201cIf there is uncertainty about what happened then you can\u2019t just charge him anyway, just because what happened was tragic,\u201d Obama added, noting that it was \u201can objective, thorough, independent federal investigation.\u201d\n\nAnd in many respects, seeing the nation\u2019s first Black president being lead across the Edmund Pettus bridge by motorcade is a powerful symbol of King Jr.\u2019s realized dream. Likewise, listening to him evoke the names of Sojourner Truth, Mary Lou Hamer, Langston Hughes, John Lewis, among others is nothing short of magical.\n\nBut shit is real out here and we are way past the point of symbolism. And the commemoration of Selma was the perfect time for Obama to talk about what he and Eric Holder could be doing in their last days to fix policies and make both the prosecution and dismantling of these rogue police departments possible. Instead he takes the political coward\u2019s way out and tells everyone to go vote instead.\n\nThe problem is that we all did: for you.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Charing Ball she explains Why President Obama's Selma Speech Was So Disappointing in a time where she feels we need some serious, concrete action.", "og": {"site_name": "MadameNoire", "description": "Charing Ball she explains Why President Obama's Selma Speech Was So Disappointing in a time where she feels we need some serious, concrete action.", "title": "Why President Obama's Selma Speech Was So Disappointing", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 388, "identifier": "http://d236bkdxj385sg.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Why-President-Obamas-Selma-Speech-Was-So-Disappointing-feat.jpg", "height": 414}, "url": "http://madamenoire.com/517142/why-president-obamas-selma-speech-was-so-disappointing/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://d236bkdxj385sg.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Why-President-Obamas-Selma-Speech-Was-So-Disappointing-feat.jpg"}, "description": "Did you listen to his remarks?
