PE Firms Abraaj and TPG Invest in Saudi Restaurant Chain, Spotlighting Middle East Interest

This is one of several deals in the Middle East for Abraaj, which is considered the largest PE investor in the region, but the first for TPG

Private equity firm TPG is making its first Saudi Arabian deal, joining forces with Middle East-focused PE firm the Abraaj Group to invest in Saudi Arabian food chain Kudu.

The target, Kudu, is a Saudi Arabian food group that has fast food and fast-casual restaurants, as well as coffee shops across the country, that sell sandwiches, hamburger, breakfast items, kids' meals and beverages. The group has five brands with more than 290 locations. Greg Helton, formerly of Burger King and Popeyes, has been put in place as Kudu's CEO.

Dubai-based Abraaj and Forth Worth, Texas-based TPG made the investment through a jointly-owned group. The firms say the space is ready to grow, in part due to an increase in disposable incomes in the area.

The Abraaj Group, considered the Middle East's largest private equity firm, focuses ontje investing in emerging markets in Africa, Asia, Latin America, the Middle East and Turkey. The firm landed on our Latest PE Fundraising Efforts list in February, and bought a stake in YÃ¶rsan Group, a Turkish dairy products business, in January 2014.For more on Abraaj, see 10 Emerging Markets to Watch: Turkey.
