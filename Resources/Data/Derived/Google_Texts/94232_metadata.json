This is the best league in the world, so I can\u2019t take anything for granted. I have to come to work again tomorrow. Tomorrow is another day, and I have to keep working hard and build on that.\u201d\n\nHishon was promoted from the fourth line to the third in the second period when winger Dennis Everberg suffered a likely season-ending shoulder injury.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s awesome to see,\u201d Avs captain Gabe Landeskog said of Hishon\u2019s goal. \u201cHe\u2019s been through a few injuries, a tough time. But he\u2019s never given up, always wanted to develop and keep going. In the (11) games he has played, you can see the skill, patience and vision he has with the puck.\u201d\n\nCenter Ryan O\u2019Reilly, who scored the Avs\u2019 second goal, said Hishon\u2019s goal might have been \u201cthe best first goal I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Reilly played a big part in one of Colorado\u2019s best offensive sequences in franchise history. In an otherwise poor offensive season, the Avalanche has put two goals together quicker than any team in franchise history.\n\nOn Feb. 16 at Arizona, Cody McLeod and Matt Duchene scored nine seconds apart, tying a franchise record.\n\nAnd Jarome Iginla and O\u2019Reilly matched the feat against the Predators.\n\nIginla scored on a high wrist shot from the left circle at 15:52 of the second period after accepting a rink-wide pass from Tyson Barrie, tying it 1-1 with his team-leading 27th goal.\n\nO\u2019Reilly won the ensuing face- off, and Landeskog took possession near the Predators\u2019 blue line. Landeskog dished to O\u2019Reilly, and No. 90 took a couple strides before ripping a slap shot inside the left post.\n\nThe momentum didn\u2019t last long.\n\nAvs defenseman Jan Hejda was called for interference with five seconds left in the second period, and Preds defenseman Ryan Ellis scored on the power play early in the third.\n\nShortly thereafter, the Avs got a big break when referees negated a Nashville goal on the premise that goalie Semyon Varlamov was interfered atop the paint. But replays showed Varlamov caught an edge and tripped himself.\n\nFootnote. Avs forward Daniel Briere missed his eighth consecutive game with a foot injury and is not likely to play in what figures to be the final two games of his NHL career. Briere, 37, is a pending unrestricted free agent who is stuck on 307 career goals, plus 53 in the postseason.\n\nMike Chambers: mchambers@denverpost.com or twitter.com/mikechambers", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Joey Hishon\u2019s first NHL goal sends Colorado to win", "title": "Joey Hishon\u2019s first NHL goal sends Colorado to win", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/04/07/joey-hishons-first-nhl-goal-sends-colorado-to-win/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150321__Joey-Hishonp1-1.jpg", "height": 465}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150321__Joey-Hishonp1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-07T21:46:48+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-25T07:53:39+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf820\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI couldn\u2019t ask for any more for that to come in a win,\u201d Hishon said of his first goal \u2014 and first NHL regular-season point.\nThe 2010 first-round draft pick, who was out of hockey for 19 months because of postconcussion symptoms, scored his first career NHL goal \u2014 the game-winner \u2014 in a 3-2 triumph over the playoff-bound Nashville Predators at the Pepsi Center.\nAvs forward Daniel Briere missed his eighth consecutive game with a foot injury and is not likely to play in what figures to be the final two games of his NHL career.\nBriere, 37, is a pending unrestricted free agent who is stuck on 307 career goals, plus 53 in the postseason.\n\u201cIt\u2019s awesome to see,\u201d Avs captain Gabe Landeskog said of Hishon\u2019s goal."}
