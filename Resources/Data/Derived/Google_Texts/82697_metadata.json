I wanted public option. That wasn\u2019t the consensus of the House and the Senate. So that didn\u2019t pass.\u201d\n\nThe White House announced Tuesday that 7 million people had signed up for Obamacare-approved insurance plans, the goal believed needed to cover the cost of the law, after the March 31 deadline to sign up for coverage.\n\nWhite House press secretary Jay Carney said Monday he did not know how many of the new enrollees previously did not have health insurance, a key factor.\n\nA reported 4.2 million Americans had their health insurance plans canceled because of Obamcare regulations. If both numbers are correct, more people have signed up for Obamacare than lost their insurance.\n\nPelosi said in response to a question from TheBlaze that taking care of the uninsured was just one goal of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act that passed in 2010, which mandated that individuals buy and employers provide health insurance or pay a federal fine.\n\n\u201cThe measure is twofold. It measures how many people have access to quality, affordable health care and insurance than who didn\u2019t,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cThe really important reason to do the Affordable Care Act \u2026 was the cost of health care in our country was unsustainable. It was unsustainable to small businesses, to individuals, to corporate America, its a competitive issue internationally and also to state and local and certainly to the federal budgets.\u201d\n\nPelosi said the law will save money on health spending, but seemed to address the widely reported increase in premiums.\n\n\u201cEven if they pay a little more in some cases, they\u2019re getting much better care,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cThey no longer have preexisting conditions as a barrier to getting access to care. This is about the quality and affordability \u2014 and affordability, that\u2019s why it has that name. It\u2019s affordable to individuals, to businesses and to the public sector. We\u2019ve already decreased the rate of increase in Medicaid, the cost of Medicare and the rest. This thing again is not just about who has it and who doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s who has what and many more people now have affordable, quality health care.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "gplus-count": 2, "twitter": {"description": "House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said Tuesday that the Founding Fathers would be pleased with Obamacare because it means that Americans can pursue happiness without being stuck with a job just to have health insurance.    \u201cThere have been critics [of the law] and there have been...", "title": "Nancy Pelosi: Founding Fathers Would Be Glad Obamacare Is Letting People Pursue Their Happiness", "url": "http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/04/01/nancy-pelosi-founding-fathers-would-be-glad-obamacare-is-letting-people-pursue-their-happiness/", "image": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/600x399.jpg", "creator": "@FredLucasWH", "site": "@theblaze", "card": "summary", "account_id": 1512944287}, "keywords": "nancy, pelosi, founding, fathers, would, glad, obamacare, letting, people, pursue, their, happiness", "sailthru.tags": "barack-obama, government, nancy-pelosi, obamacare, politics, white-house, author-fred-lucas, site-theblazecom", "facebook-count": 625, "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "msapplication-TileColor": "#282b2d", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/wide310x150.png", "categories": "barack-obama,nancy-pelosi,obamacare,white-house,government,politics", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/medium150x150.png", "comment-count": 149, "description": "House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said Tuesday that the Founding Fathers would be pleased with Obamacare because it means that Americans can pursue happiness without being stuck with a job just to have health insurance.    \u201cThere have been critics [of the law] and there have been...", "sailthru.guid": "theblazecom/788201", "linkedin-count": 1, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/small70x70.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/large310x310.png", "fb": {"admins": 517831498}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.theblaze.com/", "viewport": "width=device-width", "og": {"site_name": "The Blaze", "description": "House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said Tuesday that the Founding Fathers would be pleased with Obamacare because it means that Americans can pursue happiness without being stuck with a job just to have health insurance.    \u201cThere have been critics [of the law] and there have been...", "title": "Nancy Pelosi: Founding Fathers Would Be Glad Obamacare Is Letting People Pursue Their Happiness", "url": "http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/04/01/nancy-pelosi-founding-fathers-would-be-glad-obamacare-is-letting-people-pursue-their-happiness/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/600x399.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 399}, "type": "article"}, "dc.date": "2014-04-01T16:18:57+00:00", "twitter-count": 143}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde8f6\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe really important reason to do the Affordable Care Act \u2026 was the cost of health care in our country was unsustainable.\nIt\u2019s who has what and many more people now have affordable, quality health care.\u201d\nIt measures how many people have access to quality, affordable health care and insurance than who didn\u2019t,\u201d Pelosi said.\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said Tuesday that the Founding Fathers would be pleased with Obamacare because it means that Americans can pursue happiness without being stuck with a job just to have health insurance.\n\u201cEven if they pay a little more in some cases, they\u2019re getting much better care,\u201d Pelosi said."}
