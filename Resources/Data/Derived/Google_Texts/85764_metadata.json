Bruce Rauner and legislative leaders was pushed back to Dec. 1, the governor issued ground rules and had even assigned issues to those attending.\n\nThe good government groups that called for the sit-down want it to be a fully public discussion of the issues that have led to the state budget impasse. Rauner, however, has proposed having what amounts to opening and closing debate statements be public, with the meeting itself behind closed doors.\n\nRauner suggested the meeting, held at the behest of the Illinois Campaign for Political Reform, take place in his Springfield office beginning at 8:30 a.m. Wednesday, putting it 200 miles from the Chicago media glare. A pool camera would broadcast the first hour of the meeting, including the governor's opening remarks and 10 minutes for each leader to make their own statement.\n\nThe Republican governor also suggested topics for each to focus on, which seemed to pit some leaders against one another. In the House, he suggested Democratic Speaker Michael Madigan focus on taxes and revenue while GOP Leader Jim Durkin would talk about the need for \"reform\" before raising taxes.\n\nRauner said Senate President John Cullerton should talk about overall spending levels, pension reform and Chicago's financial crisis, while Senate GOP Leader Christine Radogno should discuss ways to improve the job climate. Rauner said he would focus on term limits, redistricting and property taxes, though he acknowledged \"these are only suggested topics.\"\n\nAfter that, the meeting with be closed to the public \"so we can continue with constructive negotiations in private,\" Rauner wrote in a letter released late Friday.\n\nA Cullerton spokeswoman said the Senate president will attend and \"is committed to working with all parties in search of the most productive forums for progress on the budget.\"\n\nMadigan has to attend an out-of-town funeral, according to a statement a spokesman issued Saturday night. So the Wednesday meeting is now scheduled for Dec. 1. Same rules apply, according to Rauner's office however.\n\nIn late June, Rauner vetoed much of the out-of-whack budget Democrats sent him. Rauner Republicans and Madigan Democrats have been at loggerheads since then, though something like 90 percent of state spending is going out the door due to a series of court orders and laws. Rauner wants approval of his pro-business, union-weakening agenda before he's willing to consider a tax hike to balance a state budget that's billions short following the January rollback of a 2011 state income tax hike.\n\nRauner wants Democrats to approve measures to weaken union rights in collective bargaining, limit worker rights in injury claims against employers and make Illinois' civil lawsuit system less friendly to plaintiffs. Democrats are allied with unions and trial lawyers and balk at the changes, suggesting they would hurt middle-class workers.
