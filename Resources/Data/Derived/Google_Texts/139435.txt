The latest numbers for sign-ups through the federal health insurance marketplace created under the Affordable Care Act show the government is just a quarter of the way to its goal of 9 million enrollees.

The Congressional Budget Office originally predicted 2015 open enrollment – the second round of enrollment under the law – would bring 13 million sign-ups. Days before sign-ups began on Nov. 15, officials with the Department of Health & Human Services projected enrollments to reach between 9 and 9.9 million.

The department's latest release of Web traffic for HealthCare.gov and sign-ups through the site counts stats through Friday, while Monday was the first deadline for sign-ups. Enrollees needed to select a plan before that day to have coverage at the beginning of 2015, although the period for open enrollment doesn't actually end until Feb. 15.

Of the 2.5 million people who have picked a plan, 1 million did so during the week that ended Friday – the fourth week of open enrollment. Officials expected sign-ups to surge leading up to the deadline, as they did last year.

But the administration is still far off from its projection. At the close of the fourth week, it was 25 percent of the way to 9 million enrollees, with nearly 2.5 million plans selected. However, applications for more than 4 million consumers seeking coverage have been submitted so far.

Website traffic and call center volume in the fourth week, meanwhile, were similar to the first week of open enrollment. It's likely the next release of traffic numbers will show a big spike as Americans rushed to finish selection in the last days before Monday.
