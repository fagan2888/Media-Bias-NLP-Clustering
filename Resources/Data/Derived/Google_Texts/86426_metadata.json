It did not say what potential security risks drones or other aircraft could pose during the pope\u2019s visit.\n\nThe number of unauthorized drown flights in the United States has jumped over the past year, raising concerns that the devices could collide with commercial aircraft or be used as a weapon in a targeted attack.\n\nREAD: Philadelphia prepares for mega event: hosting Pope Francis\n\nDrones have flown dangerously close to airliners, transported illegal drugs into the United States from Mexico and caused a security scare at the White House.\n\nAlong with the aircraft restrictions, city officials on Thursday released details about on-the-ground security during the pope\u2019s visit, including public transportation shutdowns, blocking off a 4-square-mile (10 sq km) area in central Philadelphia and management of security by the Secret Service, which protects the president and visiting heads of state.\n\nMayor Michael Nutter joked in a news conference that those expecting to have close contact with the pope might be disappointed.\n\nREAD: Want to ride the train to see the pope?
