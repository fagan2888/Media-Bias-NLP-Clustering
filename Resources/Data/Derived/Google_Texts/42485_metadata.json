There should be a way to protect that,\u201d NII Professor Isao Echizen told The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Japan Real Time blog, adding that the latest model \u201cis the world\u2019s first product\u201d to use a new type of technology to take on spy software, and in the form of a sporty, even fashionable look.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, this offering isn\u2019t expected to weigh too heavily on consumers\u2019 wallets either, reportedly coming in at around $240.\n\nImage: Federal Bureau of Investigation. more >\n\nBut as clothing and accessories aim to counter facial-recognition programs, the algorithms that run the software used to identify individuals also are gaining ground.\n\nNEC Corp., an international biotech group that boasts being among the world\u2019s top suppliers of facial-recognition program, NeoFace, said its software has recently been upgraded to become 28 percent more accurate than before.\n\n\u201cFaced with ever-increasing threats, as well as the need for improved customer engagements and loss prevention, public safety agencies (such as law enforcement, border control, immigration) and enterprises around the world are increasingly turning to facial recognition, a highly reliable and accurate identification method,\u201d Raffie Beroukhim, vice president of NEC Corp. of America\u2019s Biometrics Solutions Division, said in a statement.\n\nAdam Harvey, a New York City-based artist, has dabbled in similarly designed wearables for years, and in 2013 released a line of countersurveillance \u201cstealth wear\u201d that included anti-drone garments and pockets that can prevent radio frequencies from penetrating clothing.\n\nIn the case of the Privacy Visor, Mr. Harvey told The Washington Times that the LEDs appear to exploit a vulnerability that exists in certain types of security cameras that lack infrared cutoff filters. Since the product only works on the infrared spectrum, he said, a camera that is not sensitive to certain light would still be able, in theory, to identify a wearer without complications.\n\nNevertheless, he added that an increase in spying evidenced across the board may get consumers to stock up on clothing and accessories designed with privacy in mind.\n\n\u201cI do believe anti-surveillance fashion and wearables have a chance at becoming mainstream,\u201d Mr. Harvey said, adding that he expects a \u201ctipping point in culture when designs that may seem eccentric now will become normalized.\u201d\n\n\u201cConstantly being watched over by mass surveillance, whether it\u2019s government or corporate, can cause anxiety \u2026 I see anti-surveillance design as a field that explores \u2026 and hopefully overcome, the challenges of living in total surveillance societies,\u201d he continued.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Scientists in Japan say they're preparing to release a \"Privacy Visor,\" an over-the-ear contraption that's worn like ordinary eyeglasses but modeled to make it difficult for facial recognition technology to identify whomever is underneath.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Scientists in Japan say they\u2019re preparing to release a \u201cPrivacy Visor,\u201d an over-the-ear contraption that\u2019s worn like ordinary eyeglasses but modeled to make it difficult for facial recognition technology to identify whomever is underneath.", "title": "\u2018Privacy Visor\u2019 goggles trick facial recognition tech", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/12/privacy-visor-goggles-trick-facial-recognition-tec/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/12/PRIVACY.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/12/PRIVACY.jpg", "description": "Scientists in Japan say they're preparing to release a \"Privacy Visor,\" an over-the-ear contraption that's worn like ordinary eyeglasses but modeled to make it difficult for facial recognition technol", "card": "summary", "title": "\u2018Privacy Visor\u2019 goggles trick facial recognition tech"}, "Author": "Andrew Blake", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Technology Internet, National Institute Of Informatics, Adam Harvey"}, "article_summary": "In the case of the Privacy Visor, Mr. Harvey told The Washington Times that the LEDs appear to exploit a vulnerability that exists in certain types of security cameras that lack infrared cutoff filters.\nScientists say they\u2019re preparing to release a \u201cPrivacy Visor,\u201d an over-the-ear contraption that\u2019s worn like ordinary eyeglasses but modeled to make it difficult for facial-recognition technology to identify whomever is underneath.\nThe Tokyo-based National Institute of Informatics (NII) has tried to release privacy visors in the past, but a prototype put on display in 2013 relied on bursts from nearly a dozen LED lights that are invisible to the eye but trick surveillance tech.\n\u201cWe are often told not to unveil our personal information to others, but our faces are also a type of an ID.\nWhat\u2019s more, this offering isn\u2019t expected to weigh too heavily on consumers\u2019 wallets either, reportedly coming in at around $240."}
