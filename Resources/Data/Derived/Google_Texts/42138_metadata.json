They walk through a polished lobby, down dim hallways and settle themselves in rows in plain, wood-paneled classrooms. Here, they sit at the vanguard of the Communist Party of China.\n\nThese rising Communist Party members from across the country have come to the China Executive Leadership Academy Pudong (CELAP) in Shanghai as part of the party\u2019s decade-long effort to introduce its own elite to foreign ideas. Outside these walls, President Xi Jinping\u2019s government is campaigning to scrub Western influence from classrooms, but here some 10,000 party loyalists each year hear from top Western scholars and executives about management techniques, media relations, urban development and innovation.\n\n\u201cIt does no harm for top leaders to get to know different ideas in the world,\u201d said Zhang Xuezhong, who was barred from teaching at East China University of Political Science and Law in 2013, after publishing an article critical of the government. \u201cThe Communist Party expects the people it rules to be ignorant, but they would not expect themselves to be like this.\u201d\n\nAs China seeks to play a more decisive role on the global stage, such exposure is becoming more important \u2014 at least for those at the forefront of transforming China\u2019s economy and international role. For everyone else, education has become an ideological battleground, where destabilizing Western values must be vanquished lest they weaken the party\u2019s grip on power.\n\n\u201cYoung teachers and students are key targets of infiltration by enemy forces,\u201d Education Minister Yuan Guiren wrote in a January essay. Around the same time, he told university officials to bar \u201cteaching materials that disseminate Western values,\u201d state-run news agency Xinhua reported. His remarks came shortly after Beijing issued new guidelines ordering universities to promote loyalty to the party, core socialist values, and the teachings of Xi himself.\n\nMeanwhile, Westerners continue to march through CELAP, bringing with them an uncontrollable parade of ideas.\n\nOver 470 government leaders, business executives and academics from over 30 countries have taught at CELAP, according to the school, which says it has partnered with Harvard Business School, the Wharton School, Columbia Business School, Oxford University and Berkeley\u2019s Haas School of Business.\n\nFormer prime ministers Gordon Brown of the United Kingdom, Julia Gillard of Australia and the late Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore have visited. Former World Bank President Robert Zoellick and former U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson have given lectures. The school also has tie-ups with IBM China and Procter & Gamble China.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very unusual institution in China,\u201d said Oxford University\u2019s Nicholas Morris, who has taught at CELAP for a decade. \u201cThis institution\u2019s job is to help Chinese leaders understand Western practice.\u201d\n\nShanghai has long been China\u2019s window on the world \u2014 the leafy streets of its old French concession strike some Chinese visitors as \u201cexotic\u201d \u2014 and the cadre academy in Shanghai\u2019s new Pudong area was founded to focus on innovation, reform and management . The place reeks of exceptionalism. There is the soaring French architecture. The fleet of chefs and long reflective pools. There\u2019s even a huddle of swans on a pond ringed with weeping willows.\n\nLocated near the intersection of \u201cSplendid\u201d and \u201cCareer\u201d streets, the school can accommodate up to 800 cadres for one- to three-week courses, CELAP officials said. Thousands of party schools across China form an important network for maintaining control over the party\u2019s more than 86 million members, improving governance and incubating new ideas, according to China historian David Shambaugh.", "article_metadata": {"description": "China teaches top cadres Western ideas despite backlash", "title": "China teaches top cadres Western ideas despite backlash", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "China teaches top cadres Western ideas despite backlash", "title": "China teaches top cadres Western ideas despite backlash", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/03/china_teaches_top_cadres_western_ideas_despite_backlash/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/china-elite-cadre-school.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "China teaches top cadres Western ideas despite backlash", "title": "China teaches top cadres Western ideas despite backlash", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/china-elite-cadre-school.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Erika Kinetz", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc9b3\"", "article_summary": "Around the same time, he told university officials to bar \u201cteaching materials that disseminate Western values,\u201d state-run news agency Xinhua reported.\nFor everyone else, education has become an ideological battleground, where destabilizing Western values must be vanquished lest they weaken the party\u2019s grip on power.\nHere, they sit at the vanguard of the Communist Party of China.\nThe school also has tie-ups with IBM China and Procter & Gamble China.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very unusual institution in China,\u201d said Oxford University\u2019s Nicholas Morris, who has taught at CELAP for a decade."}
