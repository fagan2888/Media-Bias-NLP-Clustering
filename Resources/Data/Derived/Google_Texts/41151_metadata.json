Shown here are Katie Chance (Dragon), Maggie & Mattie Wilson (Dragonettes), Mackenzie Roberts (Princess Fiona), Bobby Guenther (Shrek), Nick Meyer (Donkey) and Stevie Hollander (Lord Farquaad), (Photo: Submitted )\n\nIt\u2019s summertime! Quick quiz: What\u2019s the first \u201csummertime song\u201d that pops into your head? Mine: \u201cSummertime Summertime\u201d by The Jamies. That catchy doo-wop ditty was first released in 1958, but most of us know it from its use in various TV commercials.\n\nI read the lyrics to the original song and, just between you and me, I don\u2019t know how The Jamies escaped summer school! The brother/sister duo sing: \u201cWell, are you comin\u2019 or are you ain\u2019t?/ You slow pokes are my one complaint /Hurry up before I faint / It\u2019s summerti-i-ime.\u201d\n\nThe next time a grammar fanatic complains about grammatical shortcomings of modern-day lyrics, kindly forward the \u201cSummertime\u201dlyrics to him/her! The song has other gems, such as \u201cWe\u2019ll, shut them books/ And throw \u2019em away/ Say goodbye to dull school days. ... It\u2019s Summertime!\u201d\n\nHere are a few local entertainment options for your summertime enjoyment (soundtrack optional):\n\nBravo Creative Arts Center\u2019s award-winning youth theater group will present one of its largest undertakings ever \u2014 \u201cShrek The Musical.\u201d\n\nMore than 100 of our area\u2019s talented kids are participating in Bravo\u2019s 30th theatrical production.

Yet, sometimes we forget that we need to be nurtured as well,\u201d Jones said. \u201cWe open the door for women to encounter the heart of God and the joy of even if for just a few hours, feeling like a kid again.\u201d\n\nFor more information, visit www.reclaiminghearts.com.\n\nAnd you\u2019ll certainly want to mark your calendar for the 40th annual Bethlehem UMC fish fry.
