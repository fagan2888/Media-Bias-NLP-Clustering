(Photo: Staff photo/Russ Zimmer)Buy Photo\n\nVictims of superstorm Sandy hope a new law requiring New Jersey to share more information with homeowners will make life away from home \u2014 however much longer that is \u2014 a little bit easier.\n\nLast week, Gov. Chris Christie signed S-2825 into law, something that wasn't a sure thing. He had vetoed similar legislation in the past.\n\nOn Wednesday, the bill's sponsor, Senate President Steve Sweeney, D-Gloucester, and recovery advocates gathered in Belmar to take a victory lap.\n\nThe Sandy transparency bill, as its authors have taken to calling it, is designed to provide homeowners in the Reconstruction, Rehabilitation, Elevation and Mitigation (RREM) program \u2014 and RREM's sister program for low- and moderate-income residents \u2014 with a better understanding of where they are in the rebuilding process. That's welcome news to as many as 9,000 homeowners.\n\nHighlights of the new law include:\n\n\u2022 RREM and LMI grantees should expect a customized timeline that breaks down when their project will receive payments;\n\n\u2022 a majority of homeowners in the rebuilding programs to receive at least half of their grant money by the end of this year;\n\n\u2022 the state is required to explore ways to use disaster aid already in hand, but committed elsewhere, to be used instead for homeowners who are ready to rebuild but have not had funds released.\n\nBuy Photo Belmar Mayor Matt Doherty introduces New Jersey Senate President Steve Sweeney, D-Gloucester, during a news conference Wednesday on a new Sandy law.

Martino spoke Wednesday about how the new law could have saved his family from a deluge of stress.\n\n\"My nightmare began on Thanksgiving 2014 when we were told by our builder to move out so our home could be raised \u2014 110 days went by with nothing being done and zero information given to me, except for lies from my builder,\" Mangino said.\n\n\"Knowing is the most important thing,\" he added. \"Now we can plan ahead.\u201d\n\nRuss Zimmer: 732-557-5748, razimmer@app.com\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1NFrSRc", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Victims of superstorm Sandy\u00a0hope\u00a0a new law requiring\u00a0New Jersey to share more information with homeowners will make life away from home \u2014 however much longer that is\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a little bit easier.", "og": {"site_name": "Asbury Park Press", "description": "Victims of superstorm Sandy\u00a0hope\u00a0a new law requiring\u00a0New Jersey to share more information with homeowners will make life away from home \u2014 however much longer that is\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a little bit easier.", "title": "Steve Sweeney talks new Sandy law in Belmar", "url": "http://www.app.com/story/news/local/monmouth-county/sandy-recovery/2015/08/19/steve-sweeney-sandy-transparency-belmar/31981361/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/app.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Victims of superstorm Sandy\u00a0hope\u00a0a new law requiring\u00a0New Jersey to share more information with homeowners will make life away from home \u2014 however much longer that is\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a little bit easier.", "title": "Steve Sweeney talks new Sandy law in Belmar", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/81cca9e094838b27f8890034983c0c257ff43f0f/c=71-0-728-657&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/08/19/NJGroup/AsburyPark/635755949009481106-IMG-2078.PNG", "creator": "@AsburyParkPress", "site": "@AsburyParkPress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600068887", "fb": {"app_id": 116172675120111}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/russ.zimmer.3"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "sandy, superstorm sandy, hurricane sandy, transparency, belmar, steve sweeney, new jersey, democrats, nj"}, "article_summary": "Buy Photo NJ Senate President Steve Sweeney, left and Belmar Mayor Matt Doherty, both Democrats, walk on the Belmar boardwalk after a Wednesday morning news conference on a new Sandy law.\nBuy Photo Belmar Mayor Matt Doherty introduces New Jersey Senate President Steve Sweeney, D-Gloucester, during a news conference Wednesday on a new Sandy law.\nOn Wednesday, the bill's sponsor, Senate President Steve Sweeney, D-Gloucester, and recovery advocates gathered in Belmar to take a victory lap.\nMartino spoke Wednesday about how the new law could have saved his family from a deluge of stress.\n(Photo: Staff photo/Russ Zimmer)Buy PhotoVictims of superstorm Sandy hope a new law requiring New Jersey to share more information with homeowners will make life away from home \u2014 however much longer that is \u2014 a little bit easier."}
