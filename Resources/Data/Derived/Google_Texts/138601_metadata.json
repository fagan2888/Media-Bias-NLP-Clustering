Loomis, OD, then president-elect, addressed a question on the future of private independent optometry from an attendee at the session, \u201cA Conversation With the AOA Board.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will look differently in 15 to 20 years,\u201d Loomis told the audience. \u201cOver 80% of MDs now don\u2019t work independently; they work for a hospital system. Optometry has a long history of independent practice. What we will see in the future is more group practices.\n\n\u201cThe cost of one doctor running a practice and seeing just a handful of patients a day is not sustainable with reimbursements the way they are,\u201d he continued. \u201cI think it\u2019s important to always be a part of the larger system. It\u2019s important for optometry to affiliate with Accountable Care Organizations and recognize their role as a primary eye care professional.\u201d\n\nSteven Loomis\n\nLoomis said the number of ophthalmologists is decreasing. \u201cIt will be more critical for optometry to step in and take care of the needs of the population,\u201d he said. \u201cThe difficulty is being sure we continue to integrate into the system.\u201d\n\nTrustee Robert C. Layman, OD, said AOA Excel provides tools to equip optometrists to remain independent if they so choose.\n\nAnother attendee pointed to the difficulty today\u2019s new graduates encounter paying off their student debt.\n\nSamuel D. Pierce, OD, current secretary-treasurer, also pointed to AOA Excel\u2019s career center that matches students seeking opportunities with doctors needing associates.\n\n\u201cAOA Excel has a program that will assist new graduates in financing a practice purchase,\u201d he said.\n\nAOA Federal Relations Committee chair Roger Jordan, OD, added from the audience that pending federal legislation involving the National Health Service Corps will allow students to serve for a few years and have loans forgiven.\n\nNewly elected vice president Christopher J. Quinn, OD, added: \u201cIt\u2019s very important for everyone, the senior practitioner as well as the student, to recognize the investment they have made in their education and translate that to the value of services they provide. Be careful about accepting payment that is less than the value of your services. Low reimbursement is only a function of what you\u2019re willing to take.\n\n\u201cComprehensive eye exams are a good value to the health care system; we save money in the long run,\u201d he added. \u201cWe have to get that message out to the payers.\u201d\n\nPresident-elect Andrea P. Thau, OD, said: \u201cYou can\u2019t help patients if you go out of business. Some of my colleagues have dropped some of the lower paying plans and they say they\u2019re working less and making more money now.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have to be a good business person,\u201d trustee William T. Reynolds, OD, said. \u201cIt will be different for every insurance and office.\u201d\n\nLoomis noted that AOA members, on average, have a higher income than non-AOA members \u2013 $37,000 a year for practice owners, he said.\n\nQuinn said the AOA MORE (Measures and Outcomes Registry) \u201cwill be an important tool allowing you as a provider and us as a profession to demonstrate value to get reimbursement. In 2019 the new reimbursement system will be the Merit-Based Incentive Payment System (MBIPS), and PQRS and meaningful use will all be integrated into MBIPS.\n\n\u201cThe system will allow payment bonuses of 9% to 12%,\u201d he continued. \u201cFor every provider who\u2019s getting a bonus, there will be a provider getting a penalty. The registry will allow us to collect PQRS and meaningful use data.\u201d\n\nQuinn said the development of the registry has been \u201can expensive undertaking but a tremendous benefit\u201d that is included with AOA membership. Non-members pay $1,800 per year, and the AOA hopes \u201cit will be a member recruitment tool \u2013 once they do the math,\u201d he said.\n\nQuinn added: \u201cWe have a stunning statistic; when there\u2019s evidence to support a new technique or procedure or clinical care, it takes 17 years for providers to fully adopt and incorporate that technology or technique into their practice. I think the registry will accelerate that process.\u201d\n\nCommittee member Jordan added from the audience that the registry will provide a large amount of evidence-based data to support its advocacy efforts.", "article_metadata": {"page_type": "Document", "site_name": "healiotwo", "description": "SEATTLE &ndash; Optometry&rsquo;s Meeting attendees had a unique opportunity to present questions directly to the entire American Optometric Association Board of Trustees and hear the board&rsquo;s stance on issues ranging from the future of private practice to the Affordable Care Act to the profession&rsquo;s demographic shift.\nAOA President Steven A.
