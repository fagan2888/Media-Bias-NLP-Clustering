On June 9 a B-1B crew, flying too high to detect signals worn by American forces, dropped two bombs that killed the soldiers and an Afghan sergeant.\n\nThe decision by Lt. Gen. Charles Cleveland, who heads Army Special Operations Command, is tantamount to a rejection of U.S. Central Command\u2019s official investigation as it pertained to his soldiers: Capt. Derrick Anderson, the \u201cA\u201d team commander, and Master Sgt. Travis Zellmann.\n\nSEE ALSO: Obama marks end of Afghan mission as \u2018milestone\u2019\n\nAir ForceMaj. Gen. Jeffrey Harrigian, a trained combat pilot and lead investigator, had called for charges against the two Green Berets \u201cif warranted.\u201d Gen. Harrigian listed what he considered their mistakes: lack of mission rehearsal, faulty radios and poor situational awareness.\n\nThe Green Berets, from the 5th Special Forces Group at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, submitted a rebuttal to Gen. Cleveland. They rejected the criticisms and argued that Gen. Harrigian\u2019s report contained glaring inaccuracies.\n\nThe two Special Forces soldiers asserted the bombing deaths were solely the fault of a B-1B bomber flight crew and an Air Force ground controller. They also argued the strategic bomber is ill-suited for the complex mission of close air support, which requires pilots to identify \u201cfriendlies\u201d and the enemy in crowded combat.\n\nSEE ALSO: Afghans fleeing war now face brutal winter\n\nGen. Harrigian\u2019s investigation revealed the four crew members showed incompetence in how to conduct CAS as well as in how to use their identification sensors. The Air Force Joint Terminal Attack Controller who was positioned with the Green Berets relayed inaccurate information to the bomber.\n\nThe Air Force has been reviewing whether to discipline the four officers and one enlisted man, who has since left the service.\n\nGen. Cleveland, a career Green Beret, sided with his men. He notified them Christmas Eve that he will take no adverse action.\n\n\u201cAfter carefully reviewing all of the information, the Commanding General of U.S. Army Special Operations Command, Lt. Gen. Charles T. Cleveland, decided not to relieve the team leader and team sergeant of the Special Forces Operational Detachment Alpha that was involved in the June 9th, 2014 friendly fire incident in Afghanistan. However, steps will be taken to significantly reduce the chances of this type of incident from happening again,\u201d the general\u2019s public affairs office said in a statement released to The Washington Times.\n\nA spokesman said the two will not face disciplinary action.\n\nThe day before the bombing, Capt. Anderson, his \u201cA\u201d team conventional U.S. soldiers and Afghan forces embarked on an enemy clearing operation in the Gaza Valley, Zabul Province. The aim was to rid the area of the Taliban before the presidential runoff election.\n\nThe mission completed by the next night, and in 100-degree heat, the unit prepared for the arrival of Chinook helicopters to take them back to a forward operating base.\n\nThe men came under enemy fire. The B-1B arrived and commenced a 5-mile orbit at 12,000 feet. The JTAC called in a strike. Two 500-pound bombs fell directly on the five Americans and one Afghan, who had positioned themselves on a ridge near the landing zone to return fire.\n\nKilled were Staff Sgt. Jason McDonald, Staff Sgt. Scott Studenmund, Spec. Justin Helton, Cpl. Justin Clouse and Pvt. Aaron Toppen.\n\nGen. Harrigian\u2019s investigation uncovered what could be considered a tragic comedy of errors.\n\nThe Americans wore infrared strobes to identify them as friendly in night operations. The B-1B crew repeatedly told the JTAC on the ground they could not see the strobes at the point of muzzle flashes on the ridge.\n\nIn a bizarre mix-up, the crew was trying to see the strobes through the plane\u2019s high-definition \u201csniper pod,\u201d which did not have the technical ability to see them.\n\nEven worse, one of the pilots reported he could not see strobes using his night vision goggles, the one system on the plane that could see the signal. The trouble was, at a 5-mile orbit, the plane was too far away \u2014 outside of the goggles\u2019 maximum range by about 1,000 meters.\n\nNot seeing any strobes, the pilots figured the men positioned on the ridge must be the enemy and dropped the bombs.\n\n\u201cWe never saw a strobe,\u201d a B-1B crew member later said.\n\nAt no time during the plane\u2019s circling did the crew apparently ask each other why they were not seeing strobes since they were being told that the Americans were wearing the devices.\n\nMaking matters worse, the JTAC encountered repeated problems in radio communications with the B-1B yet had no trouble speaking with other aircraft, such as an AC-130 gunship that arrived shortly before the bombing. Experts say the bomber is not suited for such tactical communication in mountainous terrain that rises as high as 12,000 feet.\n\nThe JTAC himself made a critical mistake: He told the bomber the Americans were 300 meters away from the ridge line when they were not.\n\nThe Times reported Oct. 29 that the JTAC was told on June 1 he had been selected for involuntary discharge. His career was marked by disciplinary problems. The Times learned that when he was interviewed by investigators, he showed a lack of basic knowledge of targeting procedures for close air support.\n\nThe Air Force, against stiff resistance in Congress, is attempting to retire the one plane dedicated to close air support \u2014 the storied A-10 Warthog. The Air Force has listed the B-1B as one of its replacements.\n\nThe A-10 flies lower than the B-1B, its pilots are schooled in the CAS mission, and they always wear night vision goggles at a distance that can see strobe signals.\n\nSen. John McCain, Arizona Republican and the incoming chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said at a press conference that those five soldiers might be alive today if an A-10 had arrived instead of the B-1B.\n\nSen. Kelly Ayotte, New Hampshire Republican and a committee member, told The Times, \u201cWhen our ground troops are taking fire from the enemy and call for help, our nation has a responsibility to provide the best possible close air support, and on June 9, 2014, in Afghanistan, our nation failed to do so, and the results were tragic and entirely avoidable.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Army's top special operations officer has cleared two Green Berets of wrongdoing in the worst case of \"friendly fire\" fatalities in the long Afghanistan war.", "Author": "Rowan Scarborough", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The Army\u2019s top special operations officer has cleared two Green Berets of wrongdoing in the worst case of \u201cfriendly fire\u201d fatalities in the long Afghanistan war.", "title": "Green Berets cleared in Afghanistan friendly fire deaths", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/28/green-berets-cleared-in-afghanistan-friendly-fire-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/29/5228992280_63f36a08d4_o.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/29/5228992280_63f36a08d4_o.jpg", "title": "Green Berets cleared in Afghanistan friendly fire deaths", "description": "The Army's top special operations officer has cleared two Green Berets of wrongdoing in the worst case of \"friendly fire\" fatalities in the long Afghanistan war.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "War Conflict, Jeffrey Harrigian, Afghanistan, Air Force, Charles Cleveland"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe64eb\"", "article_summary": "The Green Berets, from the 5th Special Forces Group at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, submitted a rebuttal to Gen.
