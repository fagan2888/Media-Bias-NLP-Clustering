Looking for something for your true love? Three French hens, two turtle doves and a partridge in a pear tree aren't cheap gifts, apparently. According to PNC Wealth Management's annual Christmas Price Index, the cost of a set of gifts this year is only slightly higher than last yearâ€”$27,673, if purchased in stores.

PNC Wealth Management has been doing the Christmas Price Index for more than three decades. The Christmas Price Index is a spin-off of the Consumer Price Index, which measures the change in price of an assortment of goods over time.

Associated Press published the fully-itemized breakdown of the costs of the gifts mentioned in the song. The biggest price increase came with the "geese a laying," which were $150 more than they were last Christmas season.

Here is a look at the full set of prices from PNC Wealth Management: - Partridge, $20; last year: $15 - Pear tree, $188; last year: $184 - Two turtle doves, $125; last year: same - Three French hens, $181; last year: $165 - Four calling birds (canaries), $600; last year: same - Five gold rings, $750; last year: same - Six geese-a-laying, $360; last year: $210 - Seven swans a-swimming, $7,000; last year: same - Eight maids a-milking, $58; last year: same - Nine ladies dancing (per performance), $7,553; last year: same - 10 lords a-leaping (per performance), $5,348; last year: $5,243 - 11 pipers piping (per performance), $2,635; last year: same - 12 drummers drumming (per performance), $2,855; last year: same

While I don't think many people will be asking for lords a-leaping or swimming swans this year, this is a cute and easy-to-understand way to explain basic economic principles.
