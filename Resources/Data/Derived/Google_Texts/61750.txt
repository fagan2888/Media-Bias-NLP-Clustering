"The contract is still in place," the spokeswoman said. "We are looking at rescheduling the delivery of the first plane, which was planned for this year."

She added that there were no details of the new delivery schedule.

Bloomberg had earlier cited an Airbus executive as saying the delivery delay was no big surprise given the turbulence in the Russian market.

Transaero has ordered four of the superjumbos.

The Airbus spokeswoman said the delay would not affect Airbus' plans to breakeven on the A380 program this year.
