The company said the program complies with health care-related laws, including the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe EEOC has requested a temporary injunction to stop the employee testing, which was scheduled to begin last week at various sites across the country.\n\nHoneywell, based in Morristown, New Jersey, was started in Minneapolis and remains a big employer in the Twin Cities area.\n\nLike other companies, Honeywell embraced the so-called wellness movement to prod employees into better shape and to lower health care-related costs.\n\nThe EEOC said that Honeywell\u2019s new program creates up to $4,000 in penalties for employees unless they and their spouses take blood and medical tests that can identify smoking, diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity and other health problems. They include the loss of $1,500 in company contributions to health savings accounts, a $500 medical plan surcharge, a $1,000 tobacco surcharge and a $1,000 spousal tobacco surcharge.\n\nThe suit is the third one in three months that the EEOC has filed accusing companies of setting up \u201cinvoluntary\u201d employee medical or wellness programs, said Laurie Vasichek, an attorney for the agency. Honeywell\u2019s tests and threatened penalties go too far because they are not job-related and are not consistent with any business necessity, she said.\n\n\u201cThe thing that is important about these cases is not that they are wellness or health programs, but that the company is requiring testing and asking disability questions when it\u2019s not job-related,\u201d Vasichek said. \u201cThey can only do that in situations where it\u2019s voluntary for the employee to answer.\u201d\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Honeywell announced the new biometric testing program in August and September. The agency received complaints and subsequently asked the company to drop penalties for employees who don\u2019t submit to the tests. Honeywell didn\u2019t agree to that, according to the suit.\n\nIn a statement, Honeywell denied any wrongdoing and said the screening and wellness program \u201care in strict compliance with both HIPAA and the Affordable Care Act\u2019s guidelines.\u201d\n\nThe company also said, \u201cThe Chicago EEOC office is unfamiliar with the details of our wellness programs and woefully out of step with the health care marketplace and with the core intent of the ACA to provide expanded access and improved health care to all Americans. The incentives in our wellness programs are pro consumer and have delivered demonstrably better health care outcomes for employees and their families.\u201d\n\nHoneywell said in an email the wellness program aims to motivate employees and that the company does not share medical data with insurance providers.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://detne.ws/1wZ8wzh", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "benefit rules Honeywell medical test wellness spouses mandatory health screeing", "og": {"site_name": "Detroit News", "description": "benefit rules Honeywell medical test wellness spouses mandatory health screeing", "title": "Honeywell sued for mandatory medical tests for benefits", "url": "http://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/personal-finance/2014/11/03/honeywell-sued-medical-tests/18391895/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/detroitnews.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "benefit rules Honeywell medical test wellness spouses mandatory health screeing", "title": "Feds sue Honeywell over mandatory medical tests for benefits", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/detroitnews.png", "creator": "@detroitnews", "site": "@detroitnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=904391631", "fb": {"app_id": 175422022549521}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": ""}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc7e8\"", "article_summary": "Minneapolis \u2014 Federal officials are challenging new benefit rules at Honeywell Inc. that create monetary penalties unless employees and spouses take medical tests.\nThe agency received complaints and subsequently asked the company to drop penalties for employees who don\u2019t submit to the tests.\n\u201cEmployees will be penalized if they or their spouses do not take the biometric tests,\u201d the complaint said.\nLike other companies, Honeywell embraced the so-called wellness movement to prod employees into better shape and to lower health care-related costs.\nHoneywell, based in Morristown, New Jersey, was started in Minneapolis and remains a big employer in the Twin Cities area."}
