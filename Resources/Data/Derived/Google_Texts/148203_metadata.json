When is this going to stop?\u201d He estimates area homeowners have spent about $50,000 on lake maintenance.\n\nThe county has installed 12 stormwater pipes from neighborhoods encompassing about 1,600 acres into the 125-acre lake, which is north of State Road 60, between Seffner-Valrico and Valrico roads.\n\nRecently, Beth Bravis, whose house backs up to Lake Valrico, learned the county plans to install another pipe \u2014 through her yard \u2014 that will send stormwater into the lake from nearby Front Street. It is the last of $1.7 million in stormwater improvement projects the county has undertaken in the area during the past dozen or so years to combat street flooding.\n\n\u201cOur biggest beef is they treat it like a retention pond, yet when we reach out, they won\u2019t give any assistance with spraying or anything,\u201d Bravis said. \u201cYears ago they helped with hydrilla control.\u201d\n\nThe county\u2019s answer: It\u2019s a private lake for which the government is not responsible for aesthetic maintenance. And, as far as water quality, the lake is in better shape than many, Hillsborough environmental officials say.\n\nResidents find that laughable, saying Lake Valrico is in good shape only because of the money they have invested.\n\n\u201cWe do this (dump stormwater runoff) all over the county in hundreds of water bodies,\u201d said county Engineer Mike Williams. Wherever water flowed before development, the county sends runoff today, he said. It is considered a natural drainage area.\n\nThat\u2019s not good enough for area residents who say they shouldn\u2019t have to pay to clean up the lake when it gets inundated with road and yard runoff from outside of the neighborhood.\n\nA few weeks ago, Tim Norstrem returned home from vacation to find a sign in his yard at the edge of the lake. It warned: \u201chigh bacteria levels, health risk present, no swimming, wading or fishing.\u201d County officials said a sewer overflow, caused by a grease blockage on Jan. 25 sent a small amount of raw sewage into the lake. The only notice Norstrem got was the sign, he said.\n\n\u201cEveryone else\u2019s runoff is going into our lake, but when we ask the county for help, we get nothing.\u201d He points to glass bottles, prescription pill bottles and other roadway litter that has found its way into Lake Valrico through one of the stormwater pipes.\n\n\u201cWe never did aquatic weed control (in Lake Valrico) on any formal or regular basis,\u201d said David Glicksberg, manager of the county\u2019s Environmental Services department. \u201cWe did help them one time, about eight years ago or so. They wanted help with hydrilla, and the county made a deal with them where they paid for the herbicides and we had staff apply it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t maintain for aquatic weeds, but we do maintain for function,\u201d Williams said. If drains get clogged up where they come into the lake or out of it, toward Lake Thonotosassa, the county will come in and clean up those areas, he said.\n\nAs for litter, Glicksberg said the county tries to keep it out of the drainage system as best it can. \u201cLitter, everywhere, has an impact,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a hard problem to solve.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrash has been coming into the lake for years,\u201d Norstrem said. \u201cWe have pushed a few different times and nothing has ever happened. Seems that unless we want to pony up some cash for an environmental attorney and engineer, we just continue to get patronizing lip service from the county.\u201d\n\nyhammett@tampatrib.com\n\n(813) 259-7127", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sat, 05 Apr 2014 20:27:42 -0400", "Description": "BRANDON \u2014 People living around Lake Valrico once had an amicable relationship with officials who would come out to test the water quality and treat the lake for aquatic weeds and mosquitoes.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "BRANDON \u2014 People living around Lake Valrico once had an amicable relationship with officials who would come out to test the water quality and treat the lake for aquatic weeds and mosquitoes.", "title": "Lakeside residents say government shouldn\u2019t play it both ways", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/brandon/lakeside-residents-say-government-shouldnt-play-it-both-ways-20140405/", "image": {"width": 4000, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140405/ARTICLE/140409421/EP/1/1/EP-140409421.jpg", "height": 2662}, "updated_time": "2014-04-05T20:27:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "BRANDON \u2014 People living around Lake Valrico once had an amicable relationship with officials who would come out to test the water quality and treat the lake for aquatic weeds and mosquitoes.", "title": "Lakeside residents say government shouldn\u2019t play it both ways", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140405/ARTICLE/140409421/AR/0/AR-140409421.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2014-04-05T20:27:42Z-04", "modified_time": "2014-04-05T20:27:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Residents find that laughable, saying Lake Valrico is in good shape only because of the money they have invested.\n\u201cWe never did aquatic weed control (in Lake Valrico) on any formal or regular basis,\u201d said David Glicksberg, manager of the county\u2019s Environmental Services department.\nThat\u2019s not good enough for area residents who say they shouldn\u2019t have to pay to clean up the lake when it gets inundated with road and yard runoff from outside of the neighborhood.\n\u201cWe do this (dump stormwater runoff) all over the county in hundreds of water bodies,\u201d said county Engineer Mike Williams.\n\u201cThey (Hillsborough County officials) have spent exactly zero on our lake since then,\u201d said Donald Cornett, who has lived near the lake his entire life."}
