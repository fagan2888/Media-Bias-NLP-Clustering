An hour later, Coleman had a WellCare card that paid for hospital tests, which found that 4-year-old Alexsis had an unusual bladder problem.\n\nSuch one-by-one life changes are the ground-level stakes ushered in by the election last week of businessman Matt Bevin as Kentucky's next governor. The first Republican elected to the office in 48 years, he wrapped his campaign around a pledge to dismantle Kynect, the state's response to the federal health-care law. If he follows through, the Bluegrass State would go from being perhaps the nation's premier ACA success story to the first to undo the law's results, razing a state insurance exchange and reversing its considerable expansion of Medicaid.\n\nDuring his first news conference since his unexpected victory, Bevin named abolishing Kynect as a top priority, again contending that the state can't afford it. He said change would come in \"a thoughtful way\" and made clear that people on Medicaid would pay more for their care - but left other details of his intentions blurry.\n\nStill, the broad contours of his condemnation of the ACA are creating a quandary here in remote Pike County, where 55 percent of voters supported Bevin even though the county benefits greatly from the health-care changes he plans to rescind.\n\nDennis Blackburn Jahi Chikwendiu / The Washington Post Dennis Blackburn, 56, greets his daughter, Amber Lynn Justice, at his home in South Williamson, Ky.

The 56-year-old mechanic hasn't worked since he lost his job 18 months ago at a tire company that supplies a diminishing number of local coal mines. \"The old guy had to go home,\" Blackburn says of his layoff.\n\nHe has a hereditary liver disorder, numbness in his hands and legs, back pain from folding his 6-foot-1-inch frame into 29-inch mine shafts as a young man, plus an extra heartbeat - the likely vestige of having been struck by lightning 15 years ago in his tin-roofed farmhouse.\n\nBlackburn was making small payments on an MRI he'd gotten at Pikeville Medical Center, the only hospital in a 150-mile radius, when he heard about Big Sandy's Shelby Valley Clinic. There he met Fleming, who helped him sign up for one of the managed-care Medicaid plans available in Kentucky.\n\nOn Election Day, Blackburn voted for Bevin because he is tired of career politicians and thought a businessman would be more apt to create the jobs that Pike County so needs. Yet when it comes to the state's expansion of health insurance, \"it doesn't look to me as if he understands,\" Blackburn said two days later. \"Without this little bit of help these people are giving me, I could probably die. . . . It's not right to not understand something but want to stamp it out.\"\n\nEmbracing Obamacare\n\nKentucky is the only state in the South that wholeheartedly placed in motion all the ideas for spreading access to health care envisioned by the ACA's authors. During the fall of 2013, when the federal HealthCare.gov enrollment system began as a software mess, Kynect was orderly, signing up people for private health plans and Medicaid.\n\nWhen 2014 arrived, President Barack Obama invited Gov. Steve Beshear to sit in the first lady's box for the State of the Union address and lauded him as \"a man possessed when it comes to covering his commonwealth's families.\"\n\nBy the end of that year, census figures show, no other state had as large a one-year decrease in uninsured residents. In a state of 4.4 million people, 500,000 gained coverage because of Kynect - four in five through Medicaid.\n\nThe effects were particularly dramatic in this Appalachian county, where many coal jobs have vanished and the poverty rate is 23 percent. From 2013 to 2014, the proportion of residents lacking health coverage plummeted by half - from 13 percent to 6.6 percent.\n\nThe main driver of that achievement: the whopping 7,500 people who joined Medicaid as the state widened eligibility under the health-care law.\n\nFleming has single-handedly enrolled more than 1,000 individuals and families. As a \"Kynector,\" one of the foot soldiers trained to help people sign up for ACA insurance, she has stood with fliers in front of the local Wal-Mart and at Pikeville's Hillbilly Days Festival, at churches and food banks, at the county seat's two small colleges and at drug treatment centers.\n\nMany enrollees are now sending referrals to her, people such as Tiffany Coleman. Coleman works a couple of days a month as a secretary for Appalachian Title Research off Main Street in Pikeville. She used to be a media specialist in a nearby school district until budget cuts ended her job and she decided to stay home with her toddler. Not long after, her husband, Jeremy, switched to a truck-driving job with Coca-Cola that paid $17 an hour and offered health insurance.\n\nHis new insurance card had arrived in the mail just before Alexsis got sick. But when Coleman took her to Pikeville Medical Center, she was astounded to learn that the coverage had not yet begun.\n\nEven now, Kentucky rules allow her to keep WellCare, a Medicaid managed-care plan, as a backup. Coleman is near the end of a high-risk pregnancy that requires her to get frequent shots. WellCare picks up all but a few dollars of the $200 monthly co-pay that her husband's work insurance requires for the shots.\n\nAnd WellCare still helps cover the cost of a pediatric urologist at a Lexington hospital whom Alexsis sees every three months.\n\nThe doctor's visits cost $3, medicine $1 per prescription - amounts that Coleman can manage even if she can't always pay the electric bill on time.\n\nWhat's next for Kentucky?\n\nAlong Route 23 through Pike County, a billboard for Kynect touts \"Happy teeth. Healthy bodies.\" If Bevin carries out his intentions, the billboard will be gone. So will Fleming and the other Kynectors.\n\nOutgoing Gov. Beshear, a Democrat, created Kynect and broadened Medicaid by executive order. A new governor, however, cannot undo them on his own.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Concern in coal country over next Kentucky governor's Obamacare plans", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Washington Post", "author": "Washington Post", "og": {"site_name": "chicagotribune.com", "description": "Amid the coal fields of eastern Kentucky, a small clinic that is part of the Big Sandy Health Care network furnishes daily proof of this state's full embrace of the Affordable Care Act .", "title": "Concern in coal country over next Kentucky governor's Obamacare plans", "url": "http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/ct-kentucky-governor-obamacare-20151109-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56410352/turbine/ct-kentucky-governor-obamacare-20151109", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp04.18", "twitter": {"site": "@chicagotribune", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "Kentucky governor Matt Bevin, Bevin Obamacare, Kentucky Medicaid expansion", "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=383137151, app-argument=http://www.chicagotribune.com/deeplinkid/84977634", "fb": {"page_id": 5953023255, "app_id": 306836229411287}, "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2015-11-09", "Description": "Republican Matt Bevin campaigned for Kentucky governor on a pledge to dismantle Kynect and reverse the state's Medicaid expansion.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Kentucky governor Matt Bevin, Bevin Obamacare, Kentucky Medicaid expansion"}, "article_summary": "Amid the coal fields of eastern Kentucky, a small clinic that is part of the Big Sandy Health Care network furnishes daily proof of this state's full embrace of the Affordable Care Act.\nNot long after, her husband, Jeremy, switched to a truck-driving job with Coca-Cola that paid $17 an hour and offered health insurance.\nThere he met Fleming, who helped him sign up for one of the managed-care Medicaid plans available in Kentucky.\nYet when it comes to the state's expansion of health insurance, \"it doesn't look to me as if he understands,\" Blackburn said two days later.\nEmbracing ObamacareKentucky is the only state in the South that wholeheartedly placed in motion all the ideas for spreading access to health care envisioned by the ACA's authors."}
