Doc closes practice bc of Obamacare?\u2013> MT @darab_ic: pic.twitter.com/sATWeC1ANc \u2014 Amanda Carpenter (@amandacarpenter) December 10, 2013\n\nDr. Stephen Kiteck of Somerset, Ky., said he is closing his practice because of a federal regulation that would require he transition from paper to electronic records.\n\nKiteck said the cost of the transition would be \u201ctoo much of a burden to overcome,\u201d adding that he did not want to \u201cmake a long-term investment\u201d in his practice, BuzzFeed reported.\n\nThe switch would also cost \u201cthousands of man hours or woman hours to get the records on the computer,\u201d he said.\n\nKiteck said he tried to get an exemption from requirement from the Department of Health and Human Services, but was ultimately unsuccessful.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: The requirement that Kiteck switch from paper to electronic isn\u2019t because of Obamacare. It\u2019s because of a regulation found in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (i.e. the stimulus), the BuzzFeed report adds, citing the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\nThe regulation, which all medical professionals are required to comply with by 2014, was designed as a cost-cutting measure for doctors. However, according to The New York Times, the cost-cutting part hasn\u2019t exactly worked out as planned.\n\nAlso, it\u2019s worth noting that Kiteck said in a recent interview that he is preparing to retire and that he and his staff are nearly \u201ccomputer illiterate,\u201d according to Opposing Views.\n\nKiteck said his Obamacare ad, which was placed in Kentucky\u2019s \u201cCommonwealth Journal,\u201d was mainly to let his patients know he plans to close his practice. The Kentucky doctor is required by law to give them at least 30 days notice.\n\nSo although it would be accurate to say the doctor is closing his office due to a regulation written under President Obama, it would be inaccurate to blame the closing on Obamacare.\n\nThe doctor\u2019s office did not immediately respond to TheBlaze\u2019s request for comment.\n\nHere\u2019s a video of Kiteck explaining his ad:\n\n\u2013\n\nFollow Becket Adams (@BecketAdams) on Twitter\n\nFeatured image screen grab.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "gplus-count": 5, "twitter": {"description": "A Kentucky doctor announced in an ad this week that he would be closing his practice \u201cdue to the policies of Obamacare,\u201d President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health care law.
