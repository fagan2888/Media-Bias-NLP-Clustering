It\u2019s different from the republican and democrats, but I think it takes the best of both: low taxes and small government, but individual freedom, personal freedom and I don\u2019t think either party stands for that combination. So that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to offer the voters of West Virginia this year. A new choice. We can do something different! Thank you very much.\u201d John Buckley approaches person after person during an outdoor concert in downtown Charleston earlier this summer, shaking hands and presenting each with a pamphlet.\n\nBuckley hails from New Orleans, Louisiana, but now resides in Hardy County. He\u2019s running for the seat long-time Senator Jay Rockefeller is vacating.\n\nHe caught the political bug early and has been developing his political compass ever since.\n\n\u201cPoliticians these days don\u2019t lead, they follow,\u201d Buckley said, \u201cThey should stand up for what THEY think is right, and the prescription to solve problems and issues.\u201d\n\nPolitical history:\n\nBuckley served one term as a Republican in the House of Delegates for in the state of Virginia in 1979. Afterwards he went on to get a law degree and eventually spent 12 years as a career law clerk, assisting judges researching issues and writing opinions with the US Court of Federal Claims in Washington DC. Buckley retired from the position and decided to get back into politics. But over the years, he fell away from the Republican Party.\n\nSmall government, free enterprise, individual freedoms, Buckley is running a campaign for Libertarians. He says he\u2019s not in the race just to make a statement. He wants to give people a viable third option.\n\nPlatform Issues:\n\nBuckley staunchly supports\n\nthe right to bear arms\n\nan end the war on drugs\n\nmarriage equality (Buckley is one of the only openly gay candidates running for senate.)\n\ntotal repeal of the Affordable Care Act\n\n\u201cI think [the Affordable Care Act] is going to ruin the economy and the healthcare system in this country. The federal government shouldn\u2019t be in the position of health care. That should be left to citizens solving the health care issue on the local and state levels. We shouldn\u2019t have a federal department of health and human services,\u201d Buckley said.\n\nOn Energy and Environment:\n\nBuckley is also waving the War on Coal banner. His solution to what he says is an administrative war on coal is to make any actions of agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency contingent upon the approval of congress.\n\nBuckley says balancing the needs of our economy and the needs of the environment are not mutually exclusive.\n\n\u201cI think there is Global Warming. How much there is, I don\u2019t know and I\u2019m not a scientist.\u201d\n\nBuckley said in the decade or more it might take for things to go really wrong on the global scale, we shouldn\u2019t stunt economic growth\u2014which, he says, is what fuels all technologies that will allow us to cope with the coming environmental disasters. In the meantime, Buckley is very excited about natural gas development in the northeast. He says the natural gas boom brings the promise of energy independence, and maybe more.\n\n\u201cLook what fracking has done. The administration can take quite a number of steps that can put the United States on an independent posture, energy-wise, and allow us to be an energy exporter across the world, and to then use that clout to help ease some of these sources of international discord.\u201d\n\nBuckley is looking forward to November when, he says, in the privacy of the voting booth voters will surprise everyone.", "article_metadata": {"category": "News", "description": "\u201cI\u2019m a candidate for the third party called the Libertarian party.
