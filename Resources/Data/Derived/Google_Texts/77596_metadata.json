Among them: Global government, planetary wealth redistribution from Western taxpayers to their governments, the United Nations \u201csustainable development\u201d scheme known as Agenda 21, an \u201cinternational climate regime,\u201d and economy-crippling energy-rationing policies in the West, as well as much more power for their oftentimes brutal regimes in \u201cglobal governance\u201d institutions such as the UN and the IMF. UN boss Ban Ki-moon was there to cheer them along.\n\nAs The New American reported on June 20, the governments called for what they termed a \u201cNew World Order to Live Well.\u201d This article will focus on their specific demands. The final declaration was signed by the so-called \u201cGroup of 77 plus China,\u201d which despite the name now includes more than 130 governments and autocracies ruling over nations constituting some 60 percent of humanity \u2014 from North Korea and Cuba to Zimbabwe, China, and everywhere in between. The text of the agreement offers a great deal of insight into what their sought-after \u201cNew World Order\u201d would look like: It bears striking resemblance to the new order outlined by Western globalists.\n\nMuch attention was focused on the UN\u2019s so-called \u201cpost-2015 development agenda.\u201d The G77 plus China regimes, echoing the UN, said it must be \u201cglobal in nature and universally applicable to all.\u201d As The New American reported in February, the UN already has big plans for its post-2015 \u201cagenda,\u201d much of it outlined in a radical report produced with the key assistance of Obama policy architect and extreme Big Government-monger John Podesta. Among other points, the official UN document calls for to planetary authorities to \u201cprofoundly and dramatically\u201d alter the \u201cworldview\u201d and \u201cbehavior\u201d of every person on Earth. All of it must be done under the guise of shackling humanity to the UN-managed \u201cuniversal sustainable development agenda.\u201d\n\nMultiple attacks on fundamental human rights were also on the Bolivian \u201cNew World Oder\u201d summit agenda. Unsurprisingly considering the membership list \u2014 dozens of the G77 regimes censor or outright control the media \u2014 even freedom of the press came under fire in the final declaration. \u201cWe call for an end to the use of media in any way that might disseminate distorted information against States members of the Group of 77 in complete disregard of the principle of international law,\u201d they claimed. It was not immediately clear which \u201cinternational law\u201d purportedly prohibits reporting on the crimes and brutality of the world\u2019s dictators.\n\nAs usual, \u201csustainable development\u201d \u2014 a nebulous term that can essentially be summarized as world government, central planning, and the complete transformation of human civilization under UN guidance \u2014 was also a key talking point for the regimes. \u201cWe stress the need to further mainstream sustainable development at all levels,\u201d they said. \u201cWe recall the outcome of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development ... and decide to accelerate the implementation of our respective commitments in this regard as contained in [the UN global sustainability plot known as] Agenda 21.\u201d The New American magazine reported extensively on the UN \u201cConference on Sustainable Development\u201d and its extreme agenda for humanity from Rio de Janeiro.\n\nGlobal governance, the euphemism employed by globalists worldwide to describe their vision of a planetary government, probably received more attention than any other single subject aside from sustainability. The despot-controlled UN General Assembly must also have more power, they said. \u201cWe reaffirm the central position of the General Assembly as the chief deliberative policymaking and representative organ of the United Nations, as well as the role of the Assembly in global matters of concern to the international community, as set out in the Charter of the United Nations,\u201d the regimes claimed, calling for a stronger UN.\n\n\u201cWe stress the importance of the central role of the United Nations in global economic governance,\u201d the declaration continues, demanding a bigger say in the emerging world government for the G77 plus China regimes. \u201cNew attempts must now be made to establish proper global economic governance, with the full voice, representation and participation of developing countries in discussions and decision-making.\u201d The despot-dominated UN General Assembly, where the G77 bloc controls almost two thirds of the votes, should become an \u201cemblem of global sovereignty,\u201d they added in the final agreement.\n\nThe regimes also called for \u201ca properly regulated international financial sector\u201d and for \u201ccapital markets to be mobilized to achieve sustainable development.\u201d Indeed, the focus on globalizing the regulatory regime \u2014 especially when it comes to matters of \u201cglobal economic governance\u201d \u2014 received special attention all throughout the final agreement. Even youth unemployment and worker-training programs, though, should be conducted by the UN under a \u201cglobal strategy,\u201d the declaration said.\n\nA long-running globalist theme among the establishment in the West and in the Third World involves empowering the International Monetary Fund to become a sort of global central bank in charge of a planetary currency. First, however, the Obama administration, Putin, the Communist Chinese regime, European governments, and Third World dictators are demanding that rulers of poorer countries \u2014 primarily autocrats \u2014 be given a much larger voice in how the emerging global monetary authority should operate. With only the U.S. Congress now standing in the way, the regimes reiterated their demands in the G77-China declaration.\n\nCalling for the \u201creform process\u201d over governance of Bretton Woods institutions to be finalized as soon as possible, the final agreement also demanded a \u201cmore ambitious\u201d and \u201caccelerated plan\u201d to give dictators more power. They should be allowed to participate and vote in all discussions on \u201cinternational monetary reform and in the operation of the new arrangements for special drawing rights in the International Monetary Fund (IMF),\u201d the declaration said. \u201cIn this regard, we call on the General Assembly to launch a process to reform the international financial and monetary system.\u201d\n\nCurrently, the global monetary system is dominated by the U.S. Federal Reserve and its U.S. dollar, which serves as the global reserve currency. If the G77 and their allies in the West get their way, however, that will soon change. \u201cWe affirm that the current world financial and economic crisis and its consequences for development have exposed the gaps and failures in global economic governance, including within the international financial institutions, and the urgent need for a global, universal and integrated response by the international community,\u201d the declaration continued.\n\nDemands for global currency printing followed. \u201cAlso the reform should encompass liquidity creation, including improvement in the special drawing rights for developing countries,\u201d the declaration said. By \u201cliquidity creation,\u201d they mean printing fiat currency out of thin air like central banks. Special Drawing Rights, meanwhile, are the proto-global currency already issued by the IMF, with their value based on a basket of currencies. Of course, if the Fund is allowed to emit its own \u201cliquidity,\u201d or fiat currency, the world will officially have the planetary central bank that has long been sought by globalists everywhere. The implications are historic and monumental, as self-styled global authorities would be able to fund their machinations without the need for taxpayer funding now provided by national governments.\n\nDictators and Third World governments, though will not be enough, so Western nations with a semblance of freedom and self-government remaining must also get on board. \u201cWe urge developed countries to show real political will, so that in the process of reform of the United Nations, including the strengthening and revitalization of the General Assembly as an emblem of global sovereignty, it can improve its capabilities and capacities to fully implement its mandates and ensure the effective delivery of its programme in the social, environmental and economic development fields,\u201d the declaration continued, claiming the UN has \u201cunquestioned legitimacy.\u201d It was not clear where populations were demanding a UN better able to enforce its \u201cmandates,\u201d but dictators and the Obama administration are fully on board.\n\nLike the European and American establishment, the tyrants focused a great deal of attention on inequality \u2014 much of it caused by their own plundering and enslavement of their subjects. \u201cWe call for global actions to reduce inequalities at all levels,\u201d the regimes said in their declaration, acknowledging the poverty under their rule but attributing it to everything and anything other than their tyranny. \u201cWe therefore urge countries, including through the support of international cooperation, to scale up efforts to provide equal access to opportunities and outcomes to all levels of society in accordance with national policies\u2026. We affirm that any benefit from economic growth has to be equitably shared.\u201d\n\nThe regimes also touted \u201cuniversal health coverage,\u201d demanding that \u201cdeveloped countries and relevant international organizations\u201d provide the \u201cfinancial resources and technology\u201d to make it happen. In other words, Western taxpayers must finance a sort of global ObamaCare for the world. \u201cWe urge the international health authorities and organizations, especially the World Health Organization (WHO), to take urgent action,\u201d they continued. International and regional \u201cauthorities\u201d also have a duty to feed people living under the G77 regimes, according to the declaration. \"Affordable\u201d and \u201cacceptable\u201d modern methods of \u201cfamily planning\u201d are also needed, they added.\n\nMore taxpayer funding from the West to Third World governments for a broad array of other causes \u2014 no strings attached \u2014 is also required, they claimed. \u201cWe stress that developed countries must meet and scale up their existing official development assistance,\u201d the declaration said, demanding that taxpayers in the West fork over at least one percent of their economic production to Third World regimes. \u201cThe global financial and economic crisis cannot be an excuse to avoid fulfilling existing aid commitments by developed countries and to make further commitments.\u201d All of that \u201cfinancial assistance\u201d must be handed over to those regimes \u201cwithout conditionalities,\u201d they added, saying previous debts should also be written off.\n\nDespite demanding much more wealth from Western taxpayers, the G77 plus China regimes reiterated their demands for governments ruling over wealthier and freer populations to destroy their economies under the guise of fighting non-existent man-made global warming. \u201cWe recall that climate change is one of the most serious global challenges of our times,\u201d they said without pointing out the failure of every UN climate model. \u201cWe emphasize that developed countries must take robust and ambitious mitigation commitments, with ambitious quantitative targets for limiting and reducing emissions, as required by science and mandated by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.\u201d It was not clear how \u201cscience\u201d could \u201crequire\u201d something, but the UN Climate czar previously said Communist China was doing it right.\n\nThe G77 regimes also demanded at least $100 billion per year from Western taxpayers to deal with the discredited notion of human-caused \u201cglobal warming,\u201d which has been on \u201cpause\u201d for 18 years and counting. They also said their willingness to act on \u201cglobal warming\u201d was contingent on Western politicians cooperating with the extortion demands \u2014 something governments in the West appear likely to do as part of their own efforts to create a UN climate regime complete with taxes on the essential-to-life gas carbon dioxide. While some Western governments have distanced themselves from the hysteria, the Obama administration has been charging full-speed ahead.\n\nFrom the G77 Declaration, it is clear that the ambitions for a \u201cNew World Order\u201d represent a very insidious plot. If implemented, liberty, national sovereignty, free markets, God-given rights guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution, and values held dear by Americans would all have to give way to a new system. Despite Western and Eastern globalists\u2019 open and very public support for the \u201cNew World Order\u201d envisioned by Third World despots, the American people still have the ability to crush it. Getting the U.S. government out of the UN, for example, would break the back of the plot, setting it back decades or more. However, that will happen only if American voters and their representatives demand it as vociferously as the world\u2019s dictators are pushing their nightmarish vision for humanity.\n\nAlex Newman, a foreign correspondent for The New American, is currently based in Europe.
