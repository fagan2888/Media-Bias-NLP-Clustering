( Kenneth Jessen / For the Reporter-Herald )\n\nAn example of an early roadside tourist business is located along Aspen Brook.\n\nIn 1905, the Reichardt Stage Road was constructed as a direct route to from Estes Park to Lily Lake.\n\nIn 1907, Ann Wolfram homesteaded the land were the teahouse is located and received title in 1915, the year Rocky Mountain National Park was established. Her small homestead cabin still stands on the property.\n\nWolfram constructed the teahouse in about 1913 for passing travelers and sold Indian handicrafts as well as refreshments. The original building was made of logs, but there have been several additions to convert the structure into a home.\n\nWolfram added a proper home on the property in 1938 and a bunkhouse in 1940.\n\nShe also owned a curio shop in Estes Park and is recognized as one of the area's pioneer female entrepreneurs.\n\nAfter Wolfram left the business, the teahouse and its associated buildings changed hands several times until it was purchased by the National Park Service in 1985.\n\nTo reach the Wigwam Teahouse requires a hike of over two miles from Lily Lake using the Storm Pass Trail dropping down 700 feet to Aspen Brook.\n\nThe first part of the trail is through a dense forest. It then opens out into a meadow where there are the ruins of the Jimmy Field cabin. The teahouse is located below in a second meadow near the park boundary. (Access from below is restricted by private property.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKenneth Jessen has been a Loveland resident since 1965. He is an author of 20 books and more than 1,600 articles.
