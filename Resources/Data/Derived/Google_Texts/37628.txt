Soldiers at Fort Bragg got-r-done today, with a little help from Larry the Cable Guy. The comedian surprised the troops, meeting with wounded warriors and putting on a show:

So awesome. And while Larry the Cable Guy was there to give something back to our brave soldiers, one family had a gift for him:
