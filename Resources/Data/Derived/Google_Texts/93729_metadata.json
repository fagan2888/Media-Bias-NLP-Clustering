I\u2019m so excited to leave, but so sad to leave the people at @CraigHospital.\u201d\n\nShe hashtagged the post: #idontlikegoodbye.\n\nAt the news conference, Van Dyken-Rouen said she\u2019ll continue on social media.\n\nAmong the toughest elements of her life going forward, she said, is the uncertainty surrounding severe spinal injuries.\n\nShe said she has asked the question: \u201cWill I ever walk again?\u201d And she\u2019s frustrated by the answer: \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nShe plans to be active in raising awareness about spinal-cord injuries, especially those that have \u201cno cure.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d love to see a cure for this sometime in my lifetime,\u201d she said. \u201cI know we will.\u201d\n\nVan Dyken-Rouen\u2019s husband, Tom Rouen, a former Denver Broncos punter, was by her side Thursday, as he has been daily since the accident near their Arizona home. The couple joked about Amy looking forward to driving after she leaves the hospital.\n\n\u201cIt scares me a little,\u201d Tom Rouen said.\n\n\u201cBut it did before \u2014 that\u2019s nothing new,\u201d Van Dyken-Rouen quickly added.\n\nTom said he\u2019s not surprised by Amy\u2019s attitude, determination and effort since the accident.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just what we do,\u201d he said. \u201cAs athletes, we just get up every day and work hard. That is what we are taught over our whole lives.\u201d\n\nVan Dyken-Rouen, a Cherry Creek High graduate, was the first American woman to win four gold medals in one Olympiad, the 1996 Summer Games in Atlanta.\n\nIn the 2000 Sydney Olympics, she earned two more gold medals \u2014 in the 400 freestyle relay and 400 medley relay.\n\nVan Dyken-Rouen on Thursday referred to herself as a \u201cproud paraplegic.\u201d\n\nShe admitted that her life is now filled with new challenges, but she\u2019s feeling \u201cempowered.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to try everything, I want to do everything,\u201d she said. \u201cFly, free bird, fly!\u201d\n\nKieran Nicholson: 303-954-1822, knicholson@denverpost.com or twitter.com/kierannicholson", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Olympian Amy Van Dyken-Rouen released from Craig Hospital", "title": "Olympian Amy Van Dyken-Rouen released from Craig Hospital", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/14/olympian-amy-van-dyken-rouen-released-from-craig-hospital/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140814__CD14VANDYKEN254xp1.jpg", "height": 467}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140814__CD14VANDYKEN254xp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-14T12:28:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T11:35:43+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0d50\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI can\u2019t wait to get out in the world,\u201d a smiling Van Dyken-Rouen said during a noon news conference at the hospital.\nA thankful, excited, emotional Amy Van Dyken-Rouen was cut loose from rehabilitation at Craig Hospital on Thursday \u2014 and the world champion swimmer is looking forward to new conquests.\nThursday morning, Van Dyken-Rouen tweeted: \u201cJust said good bye to my night techs.\nThe couple joked about Amy looking forward to driving after she leaves the hospital.\n\u201cBut it did before \u2014 that\u2019s nothing new,\u201d Van Dyken-Rouen quickly added."}
