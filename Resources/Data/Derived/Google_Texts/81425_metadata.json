Women are more likely to seek medical care and use health care regularly than men are. They have unique and very different needs regarding their anatomical and hormonal makeup. Women also have unique psychological issues; they experience twice the rate of depression as men, regardless of race or ethnic background.\n\nOver the past year, the pharmacotherapy landscape has undergone much change in the field of women\u2019s health. Here are overviews of those changes and insights into the contributions pharmacists can make to the health of their women patients.\n\nBone health\n\nBone health is an area of much recent drug-related activity. Conjugated estrogens and bazedoxifene (Duavee\u2014Pfizer) was approved by FDA last year for both moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause and prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Odanacatib, developed by Merck & Co., is awaiting approval after its Phase III clinical trial was published in 2013.1 Romosozumab, which inhibits osteoblast activity, is currently in a Phase III clinical trial comparing its efficacy and safety with that of alendronate.\n\nThe National Osteoporosis Foundation published a new Clinician\u2019s Guide to Prevention and Treatment of Osteoporosis, which included a recommendation on adequate intake of calcium (1000\u20131200 mg/d) and vitamin D (800\u20131000 IU/d) to reduce the risk of fracture.2 \u201cPharmacists can educate patients to not try to get vitamin D from the sun, which will increase the risk of skin cancer, but rather to get it from food sources or supplementation,\u201d said Sally Rafie, PharmD, BCPS, Medication Safety Specialist, University of California at San Diego (UCSD) Health System, and Assistant Clinical Professor of Health Sciences, UCSD Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences.\n\nBisphosphonates are also included in the recommendation, but with a limited duration of therapy of 3 to 5 years in low-risk patients due to emerging safety concerns, chiefly osteonecrosis of the jaw during prolonged therapy.\n\nCardiovascular outcomes\n\n\u201cA lot of older women are worried about getting breast cancer, but they are seven to eight times more likely to die of heart disease than breast cancer,\u201d Rafie said. \u201cObesity is now a big problem, as one-third of women in the United States are obese, and it is only going to get worse.\u201d\n\nA recent study demonstrated that inactivity among a large cohort of Australian women was the highest attributable risk factor for heart disease compared with high body mass index, smoking, and high blood pressure.3 \u201cGirls are getting obese now due to inactivity, which is a big concern,\u201d added Rafie. \u201cWe have to approach this problem not just as a weight issue but as overall well-being. [Our clinic] has a team-model approach to taking care of our patients, which includes dietitian, pharmacist, and other providers [who] can send a message to the patient from multiple angles.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are doing a good job at monitoring the use of hormonal replacement therapy for postmenopausal symptoms,\u201d said Christina M. Madison, PharmD, BCACP, AAHIVP, Associate Professor of Pharmacy Practice at Roseman University of Health Sciences, and Clinical Pharmacy Faculty member at the Southern Nevada Health District in Las Vegas. \u201cFor some women, it does make a difference in their quality of life, so it might be warranted for short-term use at a low dose,\u201d Rafie said. New data have emerged for using paroxetine for menopausal vasomotor symptoms. Paroxetine 7.5 mg safely reduces the frequency and severity of menopausal vasomotor symptoms persistently through 24 weeks of treatment, a study showed.4\n\nAccess to reproductive health care\n\nFifty percent of all pregnancies in the United States are unintended, according to Rafie. Sometimes it\u2019s a question of access to service, according to Madison. In 2012, 15% of women lacked health insurance, \u201cwhich should hopefully be addressed by the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Rafie said. California has progressive medical care in helping women better manage their reproductive health; the state administers a program called Family Planning, Access, Care, and Treatment (Family PACT), which provides a comprehensive family planning service to 1.8 million low-income families, without any shared costs.5 \u201cFor every dollar we invest in [Family PACT], we save $9,\u201d Rafie added.\n\nPharmacists\u2019 roles in women\u2019s health are also increasing in the nation\u2019s most populous state. California\u2019s 2013 law expanding pharmacists\u2019 scope of practice includes furnishing self-administered hormonal contraceptives (HCs), independently ordering and administering routine vaccinations, and furnishing prescription medications for international travelers.\n\nAdherence to HCs\n\n\u201cAdherence is an issue with oral contraception. \u2026 Women are missing two to three pills per cycle, but we don\u2019t have a good system set up for women to ensure [their] continuous use,\u201d said Rafie. This nonadherence may contribute to the unnecessary use of emergency contraceptives (ECs). \u201cWe also know that copper intrauterine devices (IUDs) are the most effective ECs and can potentially get the patient to see a physician for other health-related concerns since they have to be inserted by a health care provider,\u201d Rafie said.\n\nThe removal of EC age restrictions and behind-the-counter checkpoints has given women the opportunity to prevent potentially unintended pregnancy; however, it also results in bypassing an important opportunity for pharmacists to educate patients about sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and future contraceptive methods, as well as to screen for any signs of mental health issues, sexual assaults, or domestic violence.\n\nSTIs and HPV immunization\n\n\u201cThe incidence of STIs has plateaued, but we are still seeing an increase in HIV infections, disproportionately affecting women of color,\u201d said Madison. \u201cPart of the issue is a lack of early comprehensive sex education in schools about the transmission and prevention of STIs. A number of states are opting for \u2018abstinence-only\u2019 education in lieu of sex education.\u201d\n\nAccording to CDC\u2019s Sexually Transmitted Disease Surveillance 2012, released in January 2014, the most prevalent STIs are chlamydia and gonorrhea, with peak incidence among 15- to 24-year-olds.6 Syphilis increased by 11% over a single year primarily because of increased rates in gay and bisexual men; women in relationships with bisexual men are at risk secondarily. Nearly 20 million new STIs occur each year, with 50% in young people aged 15 to 24 years. Of more than 110 million STIs currently in the United States, nearly 80 million cases are caused by human papillomavirus (HPV), making it the most common STI in the country.\n\n\u201cWe offer HPV vaccination in our public health department\u2019s Sexual Health Clinic to improve vaccination rates in at-risk men and women,\u201d said Madison. \u201cSince Tdap [diphtheria and tetanus toxoids, and acellular pertussis vaccine] is mandated in the state of Nevada to the sixth grade, HPV is also offered at the same visit to boys and girls, thereby increasing the vaccination rate.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are finding that people do not complete the vaccination course,\u201d Rafie added. \u201cFor unknown reasons, they do not get the second or third dose of HPV.\u201d Because immunization records are not currently shared with community pharmacies in most cases, patients\u2019 regular pharmacists cannot intervene and help increase the adherence rate for completion of HPV immunization. \u201cIf we can expand immunization scope of practice within the community pharmacy, this would definitely be helpful,\u201d Rafie added.\n\nWomen older than 26 years sometimes inquire about receiving HPV vaccine. \u201cA clinic can make a decision based on the FDA labeling, but if the patient is able to pay for the vaccination, she should get it,\u201d Rafie said. \u201cIn theory, if she has not had any sexual encounters, she could also be able to get the vaccine, [because the age cutoff] is so arbitrary,\u201d Madison added. \u201cIf women are able to complete the vaccine regimen within 6 months of turning 27 years old, we still vaccinate them even though they have already been sexually active because we don\u2019t know to which strain they have been exposed. The vaccination can cover 70% of all cervical cancer. In development is a vaccine to cover the other 30% caused by strains beyond 6, 11, 16, and 18.\u201d CDC publishes information for patients about HPV and how to discuss the vaccination with children.7\n\nPregnancy and lactation\n\nMedication-related problems during pregnancy and fetal exposure to medications are of significant concern for all parties involved. According to CDC, about 90% of women take at least one medication during pregnancy, and 70% take at least one prescription medication. Over the past 30 years, use of prescription medications during the first trimester of pregnancy has increased by more than 60%. Information about teratogenic and lactation risks to the fetus is not always clear-cut with medication use. Many women do not realize they are pregnant until they are 6 to 8 weeks along, when the major fetal organs have begun or completed forming.\n\n\u201cOne of the problems with the current pregnancy categories is that they do not take into account the dose and duration of the drug therapy received during the pregnancy,\u201d Madison said. Clinicians have been waiting for a final rule on pregnancy and lactation labeling that FDA proposed in 2008, which would change the current system of letter designation to provide a more evidence-based summary of the risks and clinical considerations for clinicians. The proposed rule also addresses lactation risks in a similar manner.8 Pharmacists can use a free database called LactMed, provided by the National Institutes of Health both online and as a mobile application, to access peer-reviewed and referenced information on the effects of maternal medication use on infants.9\n\nReferences", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "American Pharmacists Association", "description": "When it comes to health care, men really could be from Mars and women from Venus.", "title": "Women\u2019s health issues: 2014 update", "url": "http://www.pharmacist.com/women-s-health-issues-2014-update", "image": "/sites/default/files/images/APhA-footer-logo.png", "updated_time": "2014-06-01T21:10:45-04:00", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-05-28T15:04:13-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-01T21:10:45-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "When it comes to health care, men really could be from Mars and women from Venus.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfde6\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe offer HPV vaccination in our public health department\u2019s Sexual Health Clinic to improve vaccination rates in at-risk men and women,\u201d said Madison.\nWomen are more likely to seek medical care and use health care regularly than men are.\nHere are overviews of those changes and insights into the contributions pharmacists can make to the health of their women patients.\nWhen it comes to health care, men really could be from Mars and women from Venus.\nIn 2012, 15% of women lacked health insurance, \u201cwhich should hopefully be addressed by the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Rafie said."}
