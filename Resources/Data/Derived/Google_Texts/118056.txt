Long Beach architectural styles

These are the primary types of architecture used in Long Beach buildings.

 Queen Anne: First appearing at at the 1876 Philadelphia Centennial Exposition, this architecture style is recognizable for its turrets, domes and cupolas, and complex roofs with shingled gables, and many have bay windows. Queen Anne homes were typically built from 1885 to 1910.

 Mission revival: Inspired by California's missions, this style became popularized after two railroad companies used it for their stations and hotels. This style is characterized by rounded arches, tiled roofs and a lack of ornamentation. Mission revival homes were common from 1890 to 1920.

 American Foursquare: Often described as "boxlike," the American Foursquare features overhanging eaves and exposed rafters and large porches. This style was popular from 1894 to 1910.

 Prairie: A group of architects in the Chicago area, including Frank Lloyd Wright, developed this style. Prairie-style homes were popular in the Midwest. This style of architecture is characterized by wide eaves, large porches and geometric patterns. Prairie homes were common from 1900 to 1922.

 Tudor revival: Medieval England inspired this style. Tudor revival buildings often have steep roofs, tall chimneys, stone or brick accents and arched windows. Tudor revival homes were popular from 1900 to 1942.

 Craftsman bungalow: These homes became available to middle-class families through mail-order houses and were affordable and easy to construct. Wide windows and doors, brick and stone foundations, wood siding and porch piers are typical with craftsman homes. This style was common from 1902 to 1925.

 Spanish Colonial revival: The creation of this type of architecture, like with mission revival, comes from the effort to restore California's missions and create a unique identity for the region. Some cities passed laws requiring new buildings to conform to this style. Spanish Colonial revival homes and buildings often have a stucco exterior, round or square towers and cupolas and red tiled roofs. This style was common from 1915 to 1942.

 Art deco: Also knows as the Zig Zag Moderne, most buildings that use this style are commercial. After Long Beach's devastating 1933 earthquake, many buildings were rebuilt in the art deco style. Art deco architecture uses bronze, copper and other metals alongside glass, brick and terra-cotta and emphasizes vertical lines. This style was common from 1925 to 1941.
