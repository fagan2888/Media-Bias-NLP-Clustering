The Office of Legal Counsel has released a 4,000-page memorandum setting forth the constitutional and statutory justifications for this controversial executive action, rooted largely in the authority granted to him under Article II, Section 2 of the U.S. Constitution, as well as the Eighth Amendment and also the Perdue Family Farms Charter. Moreover, as the OLC memo notes, presidents have been pardoning turkeys for decades. As the OLC opinion further indicates, the president\u2019s constitutional authority to pardon turkeys may well date back all the way to the Lincoln administration, pursuant to President Lincoln\u2019s son Tad pleading with his father to let the turkey destined for the family\u2019s Christmas dinner live. Lincoln cheerily allowed the turkey to roam the White House, and the family feasted on a Tofurky in its stead.\n\nDahlia Lithwick Dahlia Lithwick writes about the courts and the law for Slate, and hosts the podcast Amicus.\n\n\n\nObama\u2019s Republican critics were quick to denounce presidential claims that the turkey pardon authority rests squarely within the enumerated powers of the executive branch. Sen. Ted Cruz published an op-ed in Politico titled \u201cObama Is Not a Monarch\u201d in which he excoriated Obama\u2019s plan to pardon the turkey as \u201clawless.\u201d In it, Cruz posited that despite widespread popular resistance to turkey amnesty, \u201cPresident Obama appears to be going forward. It is lawless. It is unconstitutional. He is defiant and angry at the American people. If he acts by executive diktat, President Obama will not be acting as a president, he will be acting as a monarch.\u201d\n\nOther Republicans pondered what might ensue if millions of turkeys were spontaneously granted amnesty. Some warned that a wave of unauthorized turkeys will soon flood the country, trailing illegal giblets and stuffing, and taking up space on supermarket shelves that should have been held by Americans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner tweeted, \u201cThe president has said before that \u2018he's not a king\u2019 & he\u2019s \u2018not an emperor,\u2019 but he sure is acting like one.\u201d Former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum called the turkey pardon \u201cjust another in a long line of power grabs by this administration.\u201d\n\nAnd Michele Bachmann, in a Nov. 20 email fundraising appeal for her PAC, charged President Obama with going far beyond giving lawless turkeys amnesty, affording them the actual rights and privileges of full citizenship: \u201cWhat could more fundamentally transform our nation than making our precious American citizenship\u2014and the rule of law\u2014merely commodities to be dispensed with as our Imperial President sees fit, flooding our land with illegal turkeys which will forever alter our way of life?\u201d Bachmann also added that the newly pardoned turkeys would soon be able to vote: \u201cThe Democrats are licking their wounds after their terrible defeats this month, and are viewing these millions of illegal turkeys as the delicious shock troops for their leftist agenda.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the most damning critique came from Sen. Tom Coburn, who warned on Capital Download that the lawless presidential turkey pardon could lead to widespread anarchy and violence. \u201cThe country\u2019s going to go nuts, because they\u2019re going to see it as a move outside the authority of the president, and it\u2019s going to be a very serious situation,\u201d said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to see\u2014hopefully not\u2014but you could see instances of anarchy. ... You could see violence.\u201d\n\nIn the heat of the debate, amid threats of criminal sanctions, impeachment, and defunding the Department of Agriculture, conservatives pondered where this amnesty would end. \u201cFirst you pardon a turkey, then you\u2019re giving clemency to a sweet potato pie, and where does it end?\u201d wondered Rush Limbaugh. \u201cIf the Congress had wanted turkeys pardoned, don\u2019t you think they would have passed a law?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.subheadline": "Will the president\u2019s turkey pardon start a wave of unauthorized poultry immigration?", "fb-share": "Will the President\u2019s Turkey Pardon Start a Wave of Unauthorized Poultry Immigration?", "sailthru.author": "Dahlia Lithwick", "description": "This week, President Obama will pardon a turkey in advance of the Thanksgiving holiday.
