Do they forget that he did raise taxes, that he made an agreement with Tip O\u2019Neill on Social Security, that Ronald Reagan said [the] 11th commandment is you don\u2019t speak ill of your fellow Republicans?\u201d In the theme of invoking these compromises, McCain also said raising taxes should be an on the table as part of entitlement reform. \u201cLook, you have to put everything on the table,\u201d he said when asked if a package could include taxes. \u201cIf you don\u2019t put everything on the table, then the opposite side says, \u2018OK, but we\u2019re not going to agree to, say, raising the retirement age.\u2019 \u201c\n\nRule one among amnesty fans like Maverick: \u201cAmnesty\u201d is bad. They oppose amnesty. To them, as long as there are some preconditions to securing legal status for illegals \u2014 learn English, pay your back taxes, blah blah blah \u2014 then the process isn\u2019t \u201camnesty.\u201d Why would McCain choose to use that word in describing Reagan\u2019s immigration measure in 1986? You could, of course, argue that what Reagan did was even more lax than what McCain\u2019s Gang of Eight proposed, i.e. that Reagan\u2019s law was a true amnesty whereas McCain\u2019s really isn\u2019t, but why would Maverick want to draw that distinction when he\u2019s ostensibly praising Reagan here? He seems to be saying that Reagan\u2019s more moderate moments were a good thing \u2014 he compromised and he got stuff done, unlike that incorrigible wacko bird Cruz who\u2019s always scheming for ways to shut down the government. Sounds like he\u2019s sort of claiming Reagan for the center-right, including his record on tax hikes and, er, \u201camnesty.\u201d\n\nRight? He surely doesn\u2019t mean this in a \u201cReagan had his flaws too\u201d way. Here\u2019s what he said to another reporter this afternoon when pressed on Paul and Cruz:\n\nSen. John McCain, R-Ariz., weighed in on the debate between Sens. Rand Paul, R-Ky., and Ted Cruz, R-Texas, over Ronald Reagan\u2019s foreign policy legacy. \u201cI knew Ronald Reagan,\u201d McCain said to the Washington Examiner. \u201cThey\u2019re no Ronald Reagan. OK? They\u2019re not.\u201d Reagan, McCain said, actually reached across the aisle to work with Democrats on national security issues as well as domestic concerns. \u201cRonald Reagan used to have drinks with Tip O\u2019Neill,\u201d he said. \u201cRonald Reagan made an agreement on Social Security that raised taxes.\u201d\n\nMaybe that\u2019s the next rhetorical move on immigration reform from Republican supporters: Win one for the Gipper. (It\u2019s all yours if you want it, Team Rubio.) In that case, is it fair to assume that McCain also agrees with Paul that Reagan was a more complex figure on foreign policy than he\u2019s typically given credit for? I take it Maverick would resist, claiming that Reagan was a superhawk in the McCain mold instead, but there\u2019s just no way that\u2019s true. Show of hands: Who thinks President McCain would have withdrawn from Lebanon after the 1983 Marine barracks bombing? (He did vote against extending the Lebanon mission in the early 80s, but for complex reasons. And the older McCain seems considerably more hawkish than the younger version.) Who thinks President McCain would have withdrawn from anywhere once U.S. troops were in the field? In the McCain foreign-policy cosmology, withdrawal is always proof of a lack of resoluteness and therefore a gesture of provocative weakness. Pulling out under fire only emboldens the enemy. Which raises the question: Who among the three, McCain, Cruz, and Paul, is closest to the Reagan foreign-policy tradition? Or do we not know enough about the latter two to make any judgment yet?\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Oh my.", "title": "McCain on Ted Cruz: Have these self-proclaimed Reagan Republicans forgotten that Reagan gave amnesty to three million illegals?", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/03/11/mccain-on-ted-cruz-have-these-self-proclaimed-reagan-republicans-forgotten-that-reagan-gave-amnesty-to-three-million-illegals/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-11T22:41:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-11T23:42:48+00:00"}, "keywords": "amnesty, compromise, cruz, immigration, mccain, paul, reagan, taxes,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0fb8\"", "article_summary": "McCain on Ted Cruz: Have these self-proclaimed Reagan Republicans forgotten that Reagan gave amnesty to three million illegals?\n\u201cDid they forget that Ronald Reagan gave amnesty to three million Americans?\n\u201cI knew Ronald Reagan,\u201d McCain said to the Washington Examiner.\nWhich raises the question: Who among the three, McCain, Cruz, and Paul, is closest to the Reagan foreign-policy tradition?\n\u201cRonald Reagan used to have drinks with Tip O\u2019Neill,\u201d he said."}
