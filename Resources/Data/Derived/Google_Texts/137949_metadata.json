Once seen as the long-term answer for the Nationals at second base, he\u2019ll report to spring training next month back in a prove-it mode. That\u2019s fine with him.\n\n\u201cThe biggest thing is I know if I\u2019m given a fair opportunity to win my job, I can win my job,\u201d Espinosa said during a visit with the media at Saturday\u2019s NatsFest.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never asked for anything to be handed to me. If I get a fair opportunity to win my job, I feel I can do it.\u201d\n\nEspinosa, 26, hit 21 home runs in 2011 and 17 more in 2012. He played exceptional defense. Even going into the 2013 season with a rotator cuff issue, there was no reason to project the season would be as miserable as it ended up being for him.\n\nHe was hit by a pitch by Atlanta\u2019s Paul Maholm on April 14. The original diagnosis was a bone bruise. Nope. It was a broken wrist, which wasn\u2019t revealed until weeks later. When Espinosa was finally sent to the minors on June 2, he was carrying a batting average of .158 with only three home runs.\n\n\u201cMentally, it was really tough,\u201d Espinosa said. \u201cHaving success in the big leagues, I always felt I contributed a lot to the team, to just being completely off the map. Knowing I couldn\u2019t do anything. I couldn\u2019t swing the bat. I couldn\u2019t do anything.\u201d\n\nIt would be easy for the Nats to just move on, to pencil in Anthony Rendon at second base and maybe find a trade partner who would take on Espinosa, or try to fit him into a utility role.\n\nEither of those options may still happen, but the Nats aren\u2019t all that eager to just give up on a still-young player who showed so much promise when healthy. General manager Mike Rizzo and new manager Matt Williams have reached out to Espinosa several times this offseason, assuring him he\u2019d get that fair chance he wanted.\n\n\u201cHis head\u2019s in the right place, yes,\u201d Rizzo said. \u201cHe has a great attitude and he has worked extremely hard this offseason. He has great skills and tools and is a guy who has proven he can play and perform at the big league level and he\u2019s going to come to spring training with a great attitude and ready to take a job and make a team.\u201d\n\nWilliams has had conversations with most of his players since being named to replace Davey Johnson. He wanted to establish a line of communication with Espinosa, to let him know the opportunity would be there.\n\nTwo years after driving in a league-high 122 runs in 1990, Williams had a season with a .227 average and only 66 RBI.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been that guy,\u201d Williams said. \u201cSometimes it starts going that way and you can\u2019t stop it. So I understand that. What got me out of it, what gets most players out of it, is just the ability to relax and play. That\u2019s what I want him to do. We\u2019re going to give him a lot of reps at short, a lot of reps at second base, get him a lot of at-bats, get his stroke feeling good. If he can do all those things, then he has a chance to be a real integral part of the team.\n\n\u201cI want him to be him. I want him to play and not have expectations other than competing for a job and letting it fly in spring training. Do what he does. Because if he does that, then he\u2019s a valuable part of our team.\u201d\n\nEspinosa said a chance to get away from baseball, to relax a while with family and friends, has helped him clear his head and forget a forgettable season. He\u2019s hired a personal trainer. His wrist, he said, feels great. His shoulder, he said, never turned into a problem last season and still feel great.\n\nHe wishes he\u2019d known the full extent of his injury sooner, but that is no guarantee his season would have turned out differently.\n\nA bruise is not going to keep him from playing. A broken bone?\n\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have\u201d been playing, Espinosa said. \u201cAt the time time, I\u2019m not the doctor reading the film. Yeah, I shouldn\u2019t have been playing on a broken wrist the whole year. Like I said, you\u2019re told you have a bruise, you\u2019re going to play through a bruise. Everyone plays through bumps and bruises. If I would have known it was a broken wrist, I wouldn\u2019t have been playing at all.\u201d\n\nEspinosa wasn\u2019t recalled when the rosters expanded in September. He said he\u2019s OK with that, his performance didn\u2019t merit a return. Time has healed more than the physical wounds. If there\u2019s any lingering bitterness, he\u2019s doing what he can to keep it well hidden.\n\nGiven his versatility, a utility role would work for Espinosa. He\u2019s not thinking along those lines now. His only thought is to become the Nationals\u2019 second baseman again.\n\n\u201cIf I don\u2019t win my job, that [utility role] could be something I could fall back into,\u201d Espinosa said.\n\nWilliams also isn\u2019t ready to pin a utility label on Espinosa. He watched him from across the diamond while serving as a coach in Arizona. He saw the exceptional glove, the range, the power at the plate.\n\n\u201cI just think there\u2019s great potential there and I\u2019m not alone,\u201d Williams said. \u201cThere were multiple calls from teams throughout baseball this offseason, so I know I\u2019m not the only one thinking that and the Nationals aren\u2019t the only team thinking that.\n\n\u201cNow, he has to put it together. He has to play and he has to play well and be effective. So that\u2019s the objective going in.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The 2013 season is over, and that's a good thing for Danny Espinosa.
