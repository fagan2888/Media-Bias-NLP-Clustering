I believe we need to have new leadership on both sides of the aisle. The leadership that we have today has become so polarizing and so politicized that I\u2019m not blaming either of them, it\u2019s just the reality. So we need new leadership that Democrats and Republicans feel comfortable working with so we can start getting things done for our country again.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nShe didn\u2019t stop there.\n\n( QUIZ: How well do you know Nancy Pelosi?)\n\nIn a debate here in the bowels of the Donald L. Tucker Civic Center, Graham also said her party should stop \u201cframing\u201d Republican policies as a \u201cwar on women.\u201d\n\nShe said Democrats \u201cbit off far more than they can chew\u201d when they passed Obamacare, and said it was \u201cshoved through without any bipartisan support.\u201d\n\nShe touted her support of a Republican change to the health care law. And she said President Barack Obama was \u201cway too slow\u201d to react to the threat of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Is Bill Cassidy too boring for Louisiana?)\n\nGraham, the daughter of former governor and Sen. Bob Graham (D-Fla.), is running to unseat Rep. Steve Southerland (R-Fla.) in a northern Florida district that\u2019s become one of the tightest \u2014 and nastiest \u2014 races for the House in the country.\n\n\u201cI am not Nancy Pelosi,\u201d Graham said to applause in the debate, which was hosted by the Capital Tiger Bay Club in the state capital.\u201d Neither am I Barack Obama or Harry Reid. I am Gwen Graham. And I am going to go to Washington and represent this district so incredibly well, and represent all of the counties of this district.\u201d\n\nThe debate between Graham and Southerland was cordial, a marked departure from their previously rancorous interactions.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: House Democrats in retreat)\n\nThat the seat is even in play has surprised Republicans in D.C. The district \u2014 Florida\u2019s 2nd Congressional District \u2014 is a Republican seat. Mitt Romney won it by 6 points in 2012 and John McCain won by 5 points in 2008. Both Republicans and Democrats say that Graham and Southerland are in a dead heat with just three weeks until Election Day.\n\nTo be sure, Graham isn\u2019t looking to cozy up to House Republicans. She blamed them for the government shutdown and said that the GOP voted 54 times to repeal Obamacare, and, therefore, put the insurance companies back in control of the health care system. Graham also sharply criticized Southerland for voting against the Violence Against Women Act and gender pay equity.\n\nWhen asked if he would support Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), Southerland said yes . He quickly noted there\u2019s no one else.\n\n\u201cBecause I\u2019m there, and I am a part of the conference, I know that you can\u2019t replace somebody with nobody,\u201d he said. \u201cYou just can\u2019t, and I know that there is no one that is mounting a challenge to John Boehner. So therefore, the chances are very likely \u2026 that we will go to the floor and you will have two choices: one choice, will be perhaps John Boehner, and I think there\u2019s a very good likelihood that that\u2019s going to happen. And the other choice will most likely be Nancy Pelosi. And I\u2019ve made it crystal clear: I\u2019ll never vote for Nancy Pelosi to be speaker of the House. Ever.\u201d\n\nAuthors:", "article_metadata": {"description": "One of the top Democratic House candidates, Gwen Graham, says she would not vote for Pelosi.", "og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "One of the top Democratic House candidates, Gwen Graham, says she would not vote for Pelosi.", "title": "Graham: 'I am not Nancy Pelosi'", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/10/gwen-graham-nancy-pelosi-florida-111916.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/10/15/20141015_graham_pelosi_aps_605.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "keywords": "Obamacare,Democrats,Nancy Pelosi,House", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/Jakeshermanpolitico"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI am not Nancy Pelosi,\u201d Graham said to applause in the debate, which was hosted by the Capital Tiger Bay Club in the state capital.\u201d Neither am I Barack Obama or Harry Reid.\nAnd I\u2019ve made it crystal clear: I\u2019ll never vote for Nancy Pelosi to be speaker of the House.\n| AP Photos Graham: 'I am not Nancy Pelosi'TALLAHASSEE, Fla. \u2014 Gwen Graham, one of the top Democratic House candidates of this cycle, said she would oppose Nancy Pelosi\u2019s candidacy for the party\u2019s top leadership slot.\nAnd the other choice will most likely be Nancy Pelosi.\n( QUIZ: How well do you know Nancy Pelosi?)"}
