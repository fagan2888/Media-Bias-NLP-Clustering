Even the halftime score was the same. So was the final result, another sad one for Colorado.\n\nSeeking to end a Pac-12 losing streak that extends back to November of 2013, the Buffs were tied with Arizona 17-17 at intermission Saturday night, but a pair of backbreaking touchdowns late ruined homecoming as they absorbed their 14th consecutive conference loss, 38-31. Oregon won here two weeks ago, 41-24.\n\nCU (3-4, 0-3) led 24-17 going into the fourth quarter but Arizona (5-2, 2-2) scored twice in 4:37 to take command of the game before a crowd of 39,666.\n\n\u201cI thought our kids played extremely hard, just came up a little bit short again,\u201d said CU coach Mike MacIntyre. \u201cGoing back in that locker room with those guys, man, I love those kids, I\u2019m proud to coach them. They give everything they have, and it hurts to look in their eyes after a game like that.\n\n\u201cYou can almost taste it. That one definitely hurt.\u201d\n\nA stagnant Arizona offense came to life in the fourth quarter when coach Rich Rodriguez pulled starting quarterback Anu Solomon and replaced him with Jerrard Randall. CU\u2019s defense held Arizona scoreless in the second and third quarters despite missing its top three inside linebackers to injury, but Randall reeled off some big runs and got CU off-balance, turning the game around.\n\n\u201cIt definitely was a turning point,\u201d MacIntyre said. \u201cWe had practiced for that. He\u2019s a good football player. We didn\u2019t adjust quick enough on the field. He made us miss a couple times, bounced outside, cut inside. We knew that he would run the ball more. We just didn\u2019t execute as well as they executed against us.\u201d\n\nCU led 24-17 when Randall entered the game on the first play of the fourth quarter. He took Arizona 97 yards on six plays, including quarterback keepers of 18 and 12 yards. Randall finished the game with 81 yards rushing on 11 plays.\n\n\u201cAnu was off a little bit,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cWe weren\u2019t executing well. The way they were playing us, we thought it fit Jerrard\u2019s skill set a little bit. He gave us a lift.\u201d\n\nCU answered with a 30-yard touchdown pass from Sefo Liufau to Shay Fields, their second TD connection in the game, with 2:19 left to make it 38-31. Fields had a monster game with 168 yards on eight catches, including a 72-yard touchdown catch in the first quarter, but he was injured on his second TD catch. And the way he limped off the field meant bad news for the Buffs.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re X-raying him right now,\u201d MacIntyre said at his postgame press conference. \u201cI just saw his dad outside. It\u2019s hard on a parent.\u201d\n\nCU later announced his injury was a high ankle sprain.\n\nThe Wildcats had 616 total yards and CU 468. Liufau finished the game 27-of-42 for 340 yards, two touchdowns passing and two running without a turnover. Having been sacked eight times last week at Arizona State, he was sacked only twice in this game, both coming late\n\n\u201cI thought he made a lot of plays and did some good things for us,\u201d MacIntyre said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to play better defense. You can\u2019t give up 600 yards. That\u2019s not very good.\u201d\n\nOne reason Colorado was in the game was the revival of its running game, which sputtered the past two weeks in losses to Oregon and Arizona State after feasting on nonconference foes. Phillip Lindsay gained 93 yards on 23 carries.\n\nBut it went down as yet another loss, another game the Buffs were in position to win.\n\n\u201cIt sucks,\u201d Liufau said. \u201cWe just have to go out there and finish the game. It\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d\n\nJohn Meyer: jmeyer@denverpost.com or @johnmeyer\n\nGame Balls\n\nCU wide receiver Shay Fields: Eight catches for 168 yards, with touchdowns of 72 and 30 yards.\n\nCU quarterback Sefo Liufau: Threw for 340 yards and two touchdowns, ran for two more touchdowns, and had no turnovers.\n\nArizona running back Jared Baker: Rushed for 207 yards and two touchdowns, including a 79-yarder, and had 40 yards receiving including a 25-yard touchdown catch when CU left him uncovered out of the backfield.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado falls just short to Arizona, Pac-12 losing streak now at 14", "title": "Colorado falls just short to Arizona, Pac-12 losing streak now at 14", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/10/17/colorado-falls-just-short-to-arizona-pac-12-losing-streak-now-at-14/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151017__Colorado-Buffaloes-Arizonap1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151017__Colorado-Buffaloes-Arizonap1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-17T22:58:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T09:12:13+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "University of Colorado"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc98a\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI thought our kids played extremely hard, just came up a little bit short again,\u201d said CU coach Mike MacIntyre.\nCU quarterback Sefo Liufau: Threw for 340 yards and two touchdowns, ran for two more touchdowns, and had no turnovers.\nHe took Arizona 97 yards on six plays, including quarterback keepers of 18 and 12 yards.\nLiufau finished the game 27-of-42 for 340 yards, two touchdowns passing and two running without a turnover.\nIt\u2019s as simple as that.\u201dJohn Meyer: jmeyer@denverpost.com or @johnmeyerGame BallsCU wide receiver Shay Fields: Eight catches for 168 yards, with touchdowns of 72 and 30 yards."}
