It\u2019s not that they don\u2019t have health insurance\u2014they do\u2014or they are covered under their parent\u2019s policies thanks to the Affordable Care Act whereby children up to age 26 can be covered by their parents\u2019 insurance.\n\nThe barrier is that managed care\u2019s utilization review and medical necessity provisions make such care unaccessible.\n\nThe final rule implementing the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA) addresses \u201cto some degree\u201d problems with bringing residential care into the parity paradigm, says Mark J. Covall, president and CEO of the National Association of Psychiatric Health Systems (NAPHS), which represents hospitals and a range of community-based mental health and addiction facilities.\n\n\u201cWe think that\u2019s an important step forward,\u201d Covall told Behavioral Healthcare. However, that final rule doesn\u2019t take effect until plan years beginning in July, which for all intents and purposes means plans beginning in January 2015. \u201cSo we\u2019re still in that period where the final rule isn\u2019t effective yet,\u201d he adds.\n\nAlthough paperwork barriers are the most problematic for young people seeking intermediate levels of care that are residential, partial hospitalization, and intensive outpatient, non-quantitative treatment limitations (NQTLs) continue to create barriers to care.\n\nNAPHS is working with the Parity Implementation Coalition (PIC), which is co-chaired by Irvin Muszynski of the American Psychiatric Association and Carol McDaid of Capitol Decisions, a boutique Federal Government affairs firm. Under the efforts of the PIC, the quantitative treatment limitations \u2013 day and dollar limits to mental health and substance use disorder (SUD) services that are more stringent than those for medical/surgical services \u2013 have almost disappeared.\n\n\u201cBut when we get into the grayer area of the NQTLs, it\u2019s more difficult,\u201d says Covall. \u201cThe NQTLs include utilization review, medical-necessity criteria, and fail-first in which patients are told they have to go to outpatient first, and \u201cfail\u201d -- before intermediate or inpatient treatment will be authorized.\u201d\n\nAlthough NQTLs were banned by the interim final rule implementing the MHPAEA, and by the final rule issued last fall, most health plans are still using them, adds Covall. \u201cIn talking to my members, we see little change in the NQTL area,\u201d he said. NAPHS is working with the PIC on some strategies on enforcement.\n\nRead part 2, Parity complaint process difficult to complete.", "article_metadata": {"com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages04.net,assistedhousingfinancialinsider.com,assistedhousinginsider.com,commercialleaselawinsider.com,constructionsuperconference.com,efaconference.com,secure.rhq.com,secure2.rhq.com,www.addictionpro.com,www.apartmentlawinsider.com,www.assistedhousinginsider.com,www.behavioral.net,www.commercialleaselawinsider.com,www.commercialtenantsleaseinsider.com,www.communityassociationinsider.com,www.constructionsuperconference.com,www.entjournal.com,www.environmentsforaging.com,www.etouches.com,www.fairhousingcoach.com,www.hcd11.com,www.healthcare-informatics.com,www.healthcarebuildingideas.com,www.healthcaredesignmagazine.com,www.herdjournal.com,www.ihealthtran.com,www.landlordvtenant.com,www.ltlmagazine.com,www.nycapartmentlaw.com,www.taxcredithousinginsider.com,www.vendomegrp.com,www.vendomerealestatemedia.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "com.silverpop.cothost": "engage4.silverpop.com"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb239\"", "article_summary": "Some of the hardest-hit patients in managed behavioral health care are young people who are unable to access adequate services for psychiatric disorders.\nAlthough paperwork barriers are the most problematic for young people seeking intermediate levels of care that are residential, partial hospitalization, and intensive outpatient, non-quantitative treatment limitations (NQTLs) continue to create barriers to care.\n\u201cSo we\u2019re still in that period where the final rule isn\u2019t effective yet,\u201d he adds.\nHowever, that final rule doesn\u2019t take effect until plan years beginning in July, which for all intents and purposes means plans beginning in January 2015.\nThe barrier is that managed care\u2019s utilization review and medical necessity provisions make such care unaccessible."}
