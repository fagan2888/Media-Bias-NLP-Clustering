Like most leaders of public universities, I fret over costly federal mandates, government bureaucracy and state budget deficits. I took on these challenges and more because, as a conservatory, we build on the most meaningful traditions and teachings of art and performance to enrich our culture, enlighten society and lift the human spirit. Because we promote and advance rigorous academic and creative inquiry to nurture the talent, hone the craft and develop the voice of artists who engage our community and inspire the world. Because the passion, focus and dedication of our students make me as proud as any parent. Because, in this turbulent world of ideological battles, shrill punditry, mobile and social distractions, half-listening and over-sharing, we need art as much as faith to deepen our consciousness, feed our souls and make us whole.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Winston-Salem Journal", "description": "As chancellor of the UNC School of the Arts, the Journal invited me to describe the challenges that face my institution.
