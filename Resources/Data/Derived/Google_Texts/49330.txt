President Obama’s executive action offering deportation relief to millions of unauthorized immigrants could provide a big boost to Hillary Clinton’s expected 2016 presidential campaign, a new Latino Decisions survey suggests.

Whether Democrats can turn out large numbers of Latino voters — and win the group by a decisive margin, as Obama did in 2008 and 2012 — is a crucial question for the party as it seeks to retain the White House in two years. The poll indicates that Obama’s immigration action offers Clinton a prime opportunity to keep Latinos in the Democratic column.

The president’s action — focused on allowing those with family ties and without criminal backgrounds to remain in the U.S. — could spare up to 5 million immigrants from deportation. Asked whether they’d be more or less likely to support Clinton for president if she backed Obama’s policy and vowed to renew it, 85 percent of Latinos in the poll said they’d be more likely to vote for the former secretary of state. Only 11 percent said they’d be less likely to do so.
