The Arizona senator is not sufficiently liberal for liberals. But nor is he conservative enough for conservatives.\n\nIn an extraordinary gesture on Saturday, the Arizona Republican Party formally censured McCain, who is one of the most respected and powerful elected officials in the state. Those who adopted the resolution cited a legislative record that they say is insufficiently conservative on issues such as immigration reform and funding Obamacare.\n\nThey also seem upset that McCain has worked with Democrats to pass legislation dealing with issues such as campaign finance reform. McCain has always been a hawk on national defense, and his pro-life credentials are solid. But, on other issues, he is a moderate -- at least by Arizona standards.\n\nRuben Navarrette Jr.\n\nFormer Sen. Jon Kyl, who represented Arizona in the Senate for three terms and whose own conservative credentials were rarely called into question by Republicans, stood by McCain. He told the Arizona Republic that McCain's record was \"very conservative,\" and he called the resolution \"wacky.\"\n\nThere's that word again -- or at least a variation of it. Do you remember when McCain got in a rhetoric shoving match with Senate rookie Ted Cruz of Texas? Last year, McCain called Cruz, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Rep. Justin Amash, R-Michigan, \" wacko birds .\" He later apologized.\n\nPartly, that's what this vote in Arizona is about. It's revenge of the wacko birds. During that tussle with the tea party faction of the Senate, many of the Republican faithful -- both in Arizona and around the country -- made it known that they preferred the confrontational approach on issues such as whether to fund Obamacare.\n\nMcCain and other senators within the Republican establishment such as Lindsey Graham of South Carolina were seen as much too accommodating. Obviously, there are plenty of Republicans with good memories.\n\nJUST WATCHED McCain: Reform the NSA Replay More Videos ...

But I've seen McCain surrender before -- to right-wing Republicans in his home state when his political career seems jeopardized. That record is also fairly well-known and not nearly as commendable.\n\nI first met McCain in the late 1990s when I was a reporter and metro columnist for The Arizona Republic. I wrote some nice things about him and praised his ability to carve out an average of 60% of the Hispanic vote in his re-election campaigns.\n\nBy the time McCain ran for president the first time, in 2000, I'd left the newspaper and returned to graduate school. I was a big fan of the \"maverick\" aboard the \"Straight Talk Express\" who, according to the marketing, had gotten crossways with stuffy Senate colleagues by putting solutions ahead of partisanship and working with Democrats.\n\nTwice during the campaign, I bumped into McCain, and he recognized me on sight. He would shake my hand enthusiastically. In 2008, when he ran again, I interviewed him and wrote a column laying out the case that he was a better choice for Latinos than Barack Obama.\n\nThen came the senator's radical makeover.\n\nIn 2010, McCain found himself running for re-election against J.D. Hayworth, a former congressman turned right-wing radio talk show host. With polls showing that McCain was vulnerable to being turned out of office, the maverick became the conformist. He seemed determined to \"out crazy\" Hayworth on immigration, supporting the Arizona immigration law . That statute was opposed by 70% of Hispanics nationwide.\n\nI harshly criticized McCain for being so quick to throw Hispanics under the bus. I had hoped that someone who withstood five and a half years of torture in a North Vietnamese prison camp would have been stronger and able to resist those in his own party who tried to pull him to the nativist fringe -- and, by all appearances, succeeded in getting their way.\n\nThe low point had to have been in June 2011, when McCain -- with no evidence to back it up -- blamed some Arizona wildfires on illegal immigrants. The real culprits turned out to be two campers who had been careless about putting out their campfire, and wound up being fined $3.7 million in damages. The senator wound up with huevos rancheros on his face.\n\nNow, as McCain decides whether to run again for re-election in 2016 -- when he'll be 80, and for what would be his sixth term in the Senate -- he seems to be drifting back to the middle.\n\nOn immigration, he is signaling that he is ready to support the kind of comprehensive solution that he once championed. Perhaps in response to that, the crazies on the far right are -- through gestures like this resolution -- pulling again.\n\nLet's hope that, this time, he is stronger and better able to resist. It would be nice to have the maverick back for good.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ruben Navarrette says the Arizona senator is not sufficiently liberal for liberals, nor conservative enough for conservatives", "pubdate": "2014-01-28T12:26:51Z", "author": "By Ruben Navarrette", "og": {"site_name": "CNN", "description": "Ruben Navarrette says the Arizona senator is not sufficiently liberal for liberals, nor conservative enough for conservatives", "pubdate": "2014-01-28T12:26:51Z", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2014/01/28/opinion/navarrette-mccain-conservative-liberal/index.html", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/140112104618-exp-sotu-crowley-john-mccain-on-nsa-surveillance-program-00002001-t3-entertainment.jpg", "type": "article"}, "section": "opinion", "fb": {"app_id": 80401312489}, "thumbnail": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/140112104618-exp-sotu-crowley-john-mccain-on-nsa-surveillance-program-00002001-t3-entertainment.jpg", "source": "CNN", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.cnn.com/2014/01/28/opinion/navarrette-mccain-conservative-liberal/index.html"}, "keywords": "opinion, Opinion: John McCain faces revenge of the 'wacko birds' - CNN.com", "lastmod": "2014-01-28T12:26:51Z", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcde3a\"", "article_summary": "Last year, McCain called Cruz, Sen.
