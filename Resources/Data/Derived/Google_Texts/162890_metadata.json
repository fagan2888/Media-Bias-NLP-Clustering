The suit stems from the employee mandate portion of the law.\n\nJim Hamilton of the Indianapolis Law Firm Bose, McKinney, and Evans, which is representing the schools, says the suit challenges the authority of the federal government to impose the mandate on the State and public school corporations.\n\n\u201cAs a result of the employer mandate public schools throughout the state of Indiana have to reduce employee hours for certain specified employees to under 30 hours per week to avoid very significant penalties under the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Hamilton says.\n\nThe law calls for penalties on employers that fail to provide health insurance if they have 50 or more employees working 30 or more hours per week.\n\nIndiana House Minority Leader Democrat Scott Pelath says the law isn\u2019t perfect, but it\u2019s important to focus on the overall goal.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t get so far down in the weeds that we lose sight of the important things in the Affordable Care Act and that is making sure that everyone is a participant in the health care system, because whether they have insurance or not, they are. We have to be able to make sure that we are a healthier nation because people can go to the doctor and not the emergency room. And also that our middle class isn\u2019t going bankrupt by exploding health care costs,\u201d Pelath says.\n\nRepublican State Senator Jim Merritt believes that the lawsuit points to the ongoing concern with the law.\n\n\u201cIt appears to me that people are still confused. People don\u2019t know exactly how this is all going to be ironed out. And it is such a large large piece of legislation and large law that it may be some time before everybody understands exactly what it\u2019s all about,\u201d Merritt says.\n\nThe employer mandate was delayed for a year and is scheduled to take effect in 2015.\n\nThe School Corporations included in the suit:\n\n\u2022 Benton Community School Corporation\n\n\u2022 Community School Corporation of Eastern Hancock County\n\n\u2022 John Glenn School Corporation\n\n\u2022 Madison Consolidated Schools\n\n\u2022 Metropolitan School District of Martinsville\n\n\u2022 Monroe-Gregg School District\n\n\u2022 Mooresville Consolidated School Corporation\n\n\u2022 North Lawrence Community Schools\n\n\u2022 Northwestern Consolidated School District of Shelby County\n\n\u2022 Perry Central Community Schools\n\n\u2022 Shelbyville Central Schools\n\n\u2022 South Henry School Corporation\n\n\u2022 Southwest Parke Community School Corporation\n\n\u2022 Southwestern Jefferson County Consolidated School Corporation\n\n\u2022 Vincennes Community School Corporation", "article_metadata": {"description": "Fifteen public schools are joining the State in suing the IRS and other federal agencies over the Affordable Care Act.", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.10", "og": {"site_name": "News - Indiana Public Media", "description": "Fifteen public schools are joining the State in suing the IRS and other federal agencies over the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Indiana Public Schools Join The State In Lawsuit Over ACA | News - Indiana Public Media", "url": "http://indianapublicmedia.org/news/indiana-public-schools-join-state-lawsuit-aca-56790/", "image": "http://indianapublicmedia.org/news/files/2013/10/TeacherTable.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@wfiunews", "image": "http://indianapublicmedia.org/news/files/2013/10/TeacherTable.jpg", "description": "Fifteen public schools are joining the State in suing the IRS and other federal agencies over the Affordable Care Act.", "card": "summary", "title": "Indiana Public Schools Join The State In Lawsuit Over ACA"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160118390716029}, "bitly-verification": "f9ab3b0a7f0c", "viewport": "width=device-width,user-scalable=yes,initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The School Corporations included in the suit:\u2022 Benton Community School Corporation\u2022 Community School Corporation of Eastern Hancock County\u2022 John Glenn School Corporation\u2022 Madison Consolidated Schools\u2022 Metropolitan School District of Martinsville\u2022 Monroe-Gregg School District\u2022 Mooresville Consolidated School Corporation\u2022 North Lawrence Community Schools\u2022 Northwestern Consolidated School District of Shelby County\u2022 Perry Central Community Schools\u2022 Shelbyville Central Schools\u2022 South Henry School Corporation\u2022 Southwest Parke Community School Corporation\u2022 Southwestern Jefferson County Consolidated School Corporation\u2022 Vincennes Community School Corporation\n\u201cAs a result of the employer mandate public schools throughout the state of Indiana have to reduce employee hours for certain specified employees to under 30 hours per week to avoid very significant penalties under the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Hamilton says.\nRepublican State Senator Jim Merritt believes that the lawsuit points to the ongoing concern with the law.\nJim Hamilton of the Indianapolis Law Firm Bose, McKinney, and Evans, which is representing the schools, says the suit challenges the authority of the federal government to impose the mandate on the State and public school corporations.\nPhoto: Kyle Stokes/StateImpact Indiana To avoid penalties under the ACA, some public school corporations in Indiana have reduced the hours of certain employees including: instructional aides, bus drivers, cafeteria workers, substitute teachers and other part-time employeesFifteen public schools are joining the state in suing the IRS and other federal agencies over the Affordable Care Act."}
