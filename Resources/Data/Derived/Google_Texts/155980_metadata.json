He blamed himself for opening his mouth and saying \"dumb things.\"\n\nSantorum discussed many of the same topics as Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Dr. Ben Carson, also potential presidential candidates who attended the conference. He decried the Affordable Care Act and Common Core educational standards, an issue that has become central to many conservatives' concerns, and said that President Obama needs to \"define\" ISIS and other elements committing terrorist acts as Islamic fascists or Islamic extremists.\n\nAs Rick Santorum contemplates whether or not he will again run for president, he looks back on on all that \"crazy stuff\" he said Wait, did he just yadda-yadda away his own radical anti-abortion, anti-contraception, anti-gays, anti-everything stance? Now that's a reinvention. And he's reinventing himself as an anti-poverty crusader\u2014like Mitt Romney\u2014and otherwise hopefully more-boring person.Here's the problem, though: Republicans don't need another one of those candidates. They've got plenty. They've got dozens. They've got them stacked like cordwood in all the various states, just in case there is a sudden shortage of conservatives who don't like Common Core or the Affordable Care Act or how Obama \"defines\" ISIS and they need to summon up replacements on short notice.\n\nNo, I don't think Rick Santorum 2.0 will be happening, or if it does that it will get very far. It's a shame, but it is what it is, and if you take the creepy sermonizing out of Rick Santorum you're left with Reince Priebus in a sweater vest.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Daily Kos", "description": "As Rick Santorum contemplates whether or not he will again run for president, he looks ...", "title": "Rick Santorum sorry for all that 'crazy stuff' he said", "url": "http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/1/24/1359061/-Rick-Santorum-sorry-for-all-that-crazy-stuff-he-said", "image": "http://images.dailykos.com/images/80/story_image/RTR2YLTI.jpg?1348549316", "type": "article"}, "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "fb": {"app_id": 170357783709}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://images.dailykos.com/images/80/story_image/RTR2YLTI.jpg?1348549316"}, "description": "As Rick Santorum contemplates whether or not he will again run for president, he looks back on on all that \"crazy stuff\" he said:\nSantorum's campaign in 2012 was largely defined by his anti-abortio...", "site": "@dailykos", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Rick Santorum sorry for all that 'crazy stuff' he said"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8f0d\"", "article_summary": "No, I don't think Rick Santorum 2.0 will be happening, or if it does that it will get very far.\nIt's a shame, but it is what it is, and if you take the creepy sermonizing out of Rick Santorum you're left with Reince Priebus in a sweater vest.\nAs Rick Santorum contemplates whether or not he will again run for president, he looks back on on all that \"crazy stuff\" he said Wait, did he just yadda-yadda away his own radical anti-abortion, anti-contraception, anti-gays, anti-everything stance?\nAnd he's reinventing himself as an anti-poverty crusader\u2014like Mitt Romney\u2014and otherwise hopefully more-boring person.Here's the problem, though: Republicans don't need another one of those candidates.\nSantorum's campaign in 2012 was largely defined by his anti-abortion stances and statements regarding contraception and other \"crazy stuff that doesn't have anything to do with anything\" as Santorum put it."}
