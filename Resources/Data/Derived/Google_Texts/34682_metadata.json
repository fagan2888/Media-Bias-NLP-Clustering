That is what Christian Democrats of America\u2019s Executive Director, Christina Forrester is telling us. I hope so. It is past time Christians stood up to the bullies in their midst, the people who have hijacked their religion since the 1970s to the sound of crickets.\n\nYet far from surrendering, there are signs the Religious Right, like Fox News, is getting behind Donald Trump, who, like actor Christopher Walken, is a genre unto himself. The difference is, Walken amuses us by pretending to be scary people on film, while Trump would be more amusing if he wasn\u2019t pretending.\n\nIs Donald Trump as a sign of just how deeply the Religious Right has permeated Republican politics, or is he evidence of its demise? Is he a sign of the end of the Religious Right\u2019s dominance, that they have had to settle on a candidate who openly pooh-pooh\u2019s the doctrine of repentance, who reduces the Eucharist to a \u201clittle wine\u201d and a \u201clittle cracker\u201d?\n\nOr is he a sign of the Religious Right\u2019s resilience and its chameleon-like ability to endlessly reinvent itself? It\u2019s no small thing, after all, to have openly promoted hypocrisy through word and deed for almost 50 years while still successfully maintaining the moral high ground.\n\nThe obituary of the Religious Right has been written many times over. To confront such claims in 2012, Ed Kilgore wrote in the New Republic in 2012 that \u201cThe Political fumbling by Christian conservatives has been even worse this presidential cycle than it was in 2008.\u201d\n\nKilgore pointed to the selection of John McCain, their enemy, in 2008, and says of 2012, \u201cThe Christian Right\u2019s fatal failure this time was its inability to form a consensus behind a single candidate.\u201d\n\nHowever, he concluded that,\n\nBut if it\u2019s entirely fair to point out that the once-indomitable Christian Right has botched the contest for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination, it\u2019s another thing altogether to conclude\u2026that the Christian Right\u2019s days of national influence have finally expired.\n\nHe is right. On each occasion, the rumors of its death have been proven wrong. And this is exactly what Bill Berkowitz pointed out in Religious Dispatches in June of 2009 that \u201ceven after an Obama victory reports of the death of the Religious Right are greatly exaggerated.\u201d\n\nAnd Dan Gilgoff, writing in U.S. News & World Report, argued in April 2009 that \u201cfor a movement on the verge of collapse, the Christian right ain\u2019t doing too bad so far as influencing policy goes,\u201d and pointed to its \u201c29-to-0 record in amending state constitutions to ban same-sex marriage\u201d as evidence.\n\nKilgore, far from admitting defeat, claimed victory: \u201cBut if they haven\u2019t been able to pull their muscle behind a single candidate, that\u2019s not a sign that they are on the wane\u2014it\u2019s a sign that, as far as the Republican Party is concerned, they have already won.\u201d\n\nSo yes, Americans would be justified to be skeptical of any such claims. But let\u2019s look at the argument.\n\nAccording to Forrester, there are \u201ckey indicators that Christian votes will begin to lean more democratic in the 2016 Presidential election and beyond.\u201d\n\n1. Wedge issues have gone awry. The Republican Party\u2019s two \u201cclinch\u201d issues\u2013gay marriage and abortion\u2013are becoming less of a factor for voters. While many Christians, regardless of their political affiliation, may be pro-life and in favor of traditional marriage, the tone of the conversation has changed dramatically and is no longer becoming a singular or even primary influence in picking a candidate. And with the recent Supreme Court decision, one could argue the fight for \u201ctraditional marriage\u201d is now truly a moot point. One recent high-profile report even underscored that \u201cmost Republican presidential candidates seem to want to avoid talking about the issue [all together]\u2014as Mitt Romney largely did in 2012.\u201d Another 2015 report underscoring \u201cThe Republican Party\u2019s Abortion Bind\u201d cites that, despite \u201ca newly enormous majority in the House and a newly minted majority in the Senate, Republicans finally had a chance to get a bill to the president,\u201d but to no avail as the GOP coalition fell apart on technicalities in its attempt to pass a new bill. The report further highlights part of the challenge for Republicans, citing that \u201ceveryone knows the GOP faces a demographic time bomb, since its voters are older and whiter and more pro-life than the general population, so it\u2019s risky to do anything that might make it harder to win them over.\u201d Further, polling has shown that \u201cthe majority of Americans, based on gender, do not let their views on abortion affect their choice in a presidential candidate.\u201d That finding reportedly came shortly after Rep. Todd Akin, the then Republican Senate hopeful from Missouri, drew backlash from his own party for his comments regarding \u201clegitimate rape\u201d and abortion.\n\n2. \u201cCompassionate conservatism was a lie.\u201d In 2000 when George W. Bush ran for President, he won based on the assurance of a softer, more holistic conservatism that promised to leave \u201cno child left behind\u201d and to be more inclusive of groups across varied economic backgrounds. Fast forward to today and only a few voices in the Republican party are discussing economic equality. Indeed, the Republican party is still not only perceived as the party of the wealthy, but duly anointed as outlined in a March 2015 report titled \u201cThe Fight for the Soul of the Republican Party Is Over: The Rich Won Again\u201d that detailed the epic failure of \u201creform conservatives\u201d striving to reconnect the party to middle-class and low-income voters. Terms such as \u201cThe War on the Poor\u201d and trending Twitter hashtags like #GOPWaronthePoor #WaronthePoor show that more and more Americans, and Christians, are identifying the Republican party with the wealthy, the so-called 1%, and against policies to help the poor. The GOP has not helped itself in this regard by allowing members of Congress and outspoken Evangelical leaders to leverage the media with messages that insult or demean food stamp recipients and others in the low economic class. When every policy, from the subsidized \u201cObamaphone\u201d program to budgets for food stamps, which assists our nation\u2019s poor, is slammed by the GOP establishment, the people, including Christians, are finally starting to take notice. This is especially true in states where GOP governors have refused the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, which would help millions in their states be able to receive healthcare. The effect of the GOP general narrative on helping these millions of poor families is especially heard\u2026and felt. This is especially noticed by Christians who identify Jesus\u2019 teachings of helping the poor and what our attitudes should be towards the needy. More and more Christians are identifying as Democrat or Liberal simply because they can no longer justify supporting the Republican party, based on these issues. As a result, we are seeing a rise in \u201cpro-life Democrats\u201d who are for abortion restrictions, but also broaden their definition of \u201cpro-life\u201d to all people in all phases of life, as scripture indicates. In this case, anyone classed as \u201cthe least of these\u201d is a pro-life concern.\n\n3. Christian Millennials are progressive-minded. In 2012, 67% of those under 35 voted for Obama. Since 62% of Millennials under 35 also identify with some form of Christianity, it stands to reason that there are millions of Millennial Christians who are progressive minded (or hold progressive values). Even though Republicans saw victory in the midterm elections, progressive ballot items won by a landslide, and Millennials voted in line with those items. Millennial Christians are also more inclined to support the LGBT rights movement, gay marriage and civil rights issues. They largely identify with values of compassion and minority issues, which have become known as part of the Democratic platform. Millennials, including Christians, dislike the GOP rhetoric on religious freedom laws and gay rights, women\u2019s rights and minority issues.\n\nForrester is not the first to make these claims. Georgetown University historian Michael Kazin suggested in 2012 (the claims to which New Republic\u2019s Kilgore was responding) that the Religious Right was \u201con the wane\u201d because it was \u201cincreasingly out of touch with public opinion, and on the wrong side of generational tends.\u201d Kilgore was willing to concede on same-sex marriage but contested Kazin on abortion.\n\nCJ Werleman said much the same on AlterNet in 2014, writing that \u201cThe Christian Right\u2019s dirty little secret is they are acutely aware that changing demographics are running against them.\u201d In Werelman\u2019s view, far from being a rumor, even the Religious Right knows it has lost the culture war.\n\nOver at Bloomberg, Francis Wilkinson of the editorial board looked to the Academy Awards, of all places, for evidence of the rout: the 2014 selection of openly lesbian Ellen DeGeneres as \u201cthe safe choice to host one of the most mainstream, popular television events of the year, watched by some 40 million Americans.\u201d\n\nWilkinson opined that while the rest of us have come to grips with \u201cgay equality\u201d and that \u201cReligious conservatives will take a little longer not because they are religious, but because they are conservatives.\u201d\n\nKazin wrote in January 2012,\n\nEvery GOP candidate still in the race speaks of Planned Parenthood as if it were a band of terrorists and vows to stop the largest and oldest reproductive rights group in the country from winning even a dollar of federal funding\u2014and all of them except Ron Paul has signed a firm pledge to support a constitutional amendment that would essentially ban same-sex marriage.\n\nAs we well know, because of some faked videos, the assault on Planned Parenthood, three years on, is far from over \u2013 or won. The simple fact is that if Republicans gained the Senate, they lost the White House \u2013 again. For conservatives it is a simple matter formula of \u201cPlanned Parenthood = abortion\u201d but Obama has proven himself a strong champion of women\u2019s rights \u2013 including reproductive rights. And Democrats in Congress, many of them women, have stood firm against conservative efforts to give men authority over their bodies.\n\nAnd the pledge against same sex marriage\u2026well, we saw how that turned out, didn\u2019t we? Kilgore was right to concede in 2012. The Supreme Court has spoken. If corporations are people, so are gays and lesbians, and as such, they have the same rights to marriage as \u201cheterosexuals.\u201d\n\nKazin said liberals had won another culture war issue too: contraception, pointing out that \u201cThe news that the traditionalist Catholic ex-Senator from Pennsylvania [Rick Santorum] had suggested that contraception \u2018is counter to how things are supposed to be\u2019 was enough to bury under a heap of ridicule whatever slim chance he had to win the nomination.\u201d\n\nKilgore\u2019s conclusion is my longstanding conclusion: \u201cThe Christian Right has been buried many times by secular observers since its advent as a powerful political movement in the late 1970s. It\u2019s far too early to write yet another obituary.\u201d\n\nThat isn\u2019t to say that it isn\u2019t on a wane. Take heart. Forrester makes some valid points. Mainline Christians have begun to organize and to speak up, for example, with regards the Iran nuclear deal, and against war. We even have a Pope standing up to the Religious Right.\n\nHowever, demographics or not, Christians have not seized the mantle from the Religious Right. It may be coming, but it\u2019s not here: The struggle is about more than the White House, despite the Religious Right\u2019s victory in 2000, putting George W. Bush in the Oval Office.\n\nIt has always been so: it is about communities; towns and cities, and fifty states and their state legislatures, their governors, and their representatives in Congress.\n\nThese are the areas where the Religious Right still dominates. In \u201cJesus welcomes you to\u201d signs at the edge of small-town America, and Ten Commandments displays in courthouses; in charter schools that teach religion, and public school textbooks that teach creationism rather than science to our children.\n\nEvidence of the end of Republican dominance of Christianity will be in the form not of a Democratic presidential victory, which is almost assured, but success in these local elections, and the advent of true religious freedom for all Americans over the Religious Right\u2019s imposition of religious tyranny.\n\nI\u2019ll believe the Religious Right is dead when I see it lying in the road.", "article_metadata": {"description": "We have been hearing for a long time that the Religious Right is dead; demographics or not, I'll believe it when I see it lying in the road", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Hrafnkell Haraldsson", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "We have been hearing for a long time that the Religious Right is dead; demographics or not, I'll believe it when I see it lying in the road", "title": "Christian Democrats of America Say Republican Dominance of Christianity Ending", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2015/08/29/christian-democrats-america-republican-dominance-christianity.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/flag-cross-elephant.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-08-29T08:03:14+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Featured News,Republican Party,2016 Elections,Abortion,Christian Democrats of America,Christianity,Christina Forrester,contraception,culture war,marriage equality,politics,religion,Religious Right,Women's Reproductive Rights,politicususa,liberal,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Republican Party", "published_time": "2015-08-29T08:03:14+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-29T08:03:14+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "2016 Elections, Abortion, Christian Democrats of America, Christianity, Christina Forrester, contraception, culture war, marriage equality, politics, religion, Religious Right, Republican Party, Women's Reproductive Rights"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda4f9\"", "article_summary": "Or is he a sign of the Religious Right\u2019s resilience and its chameleon-like ability to endlessly reinvent itself?\nFast forward to today and only a few voices in the Republican party are discussing economic equality.\nI\u2019ll believe the Religious Right is dead when I see it lying in the road.\nWe are hearing again that \u201cthe Republican Monopoly on Christianity is Nearing its End\u201d \u2013 in other words, that the Religious Right is finally losing its grip.\nThe obituary of the Religious Right has been written many times over."}
