Water from a hose behind the $1,800 device flows over coils that cool the air pushed by the fan. Similar devices are used at athletic events, although those often blow a mist, too.\n\nThe agency is trying the new strategy in metal dormitory buildings at the seven prison units. Three are transfer facilities where inmates are housed while awaiting permanent assignment. Four of the units are state jails. They\u2019re all part of a 109-unit corrections system that holds about 150,000 inmates.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve grown up in Texas, we know it\u2019s hot,\u201d Pam Baggett, warden at the 2,100-inmate Holliday Unit, a transfer facility north of Huntsville where the devices were installed in May. \u201cWe do everything we can to keep them safe and keep them well.\u201d\n\nThe latest actions are no coincidence, according to Jeff Edwards, a lawyer representing prisoners who find the heat intolerable and families who say their loved ones died behind bars because of high temperatures.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad they\u2019re taking even a small step,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cIt\u2019s like chiseling granite, that\u2019s what happening here. There are eight wrongful death lawsuits pending and a class action lawsuit pending.\n\n\u201cTo suggest this is just a coincidence belies the facts.\u201d\n\nPrison officials won\u2019t address the allegations in the lawsuits, saying they don\u2019t comment on pending litigation.\n\nThe federal Bureau of Justice Statistics doesn\u2019t track heat-related deaths in jails or prisons. The case of a mentally ill homeless veteran who died in February in a 100-degree Rikers Island jail cell in New York received national attention; the heat came from a malfunctioning heater.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Texas prisons address heat issues with large fans", "title": "Texas prisons address heat issues with large fans", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Texas prisons address heat issues with large fans", "title": "Texas prisons address heat issues with large fans", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/21/texas_prisons_address_heat_issues_with_large_fans/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/texas-prisons-heat.jpeg1-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Texas prisons address heat issues with large fans", "title": "Texas prisons address heat issues with large fans", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/texas-prisons-heat.jpeg1-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Michael Graczyk", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2579\"", "article_summary": "The agency is trying the new strategy in metal dormitory buildings at the seven prison units.\nWater from a hose behind the $1,800 device flows over coils that cool the air pushed by the fan.\nThe federal Bureau of Justice Statistics doesn\u2019t track heat-related deaths in jails or prisons.\nTexas Department of Criminal Justice officials insist the new cooling devices are not in response to numerous lawsuits alleging triple-digit temperature readings inside prison buildings are improperly cruel punishment and have led to inmates\u2019 deaths.\n\u201cTo suggest this is just a coincidence belies the facts.\u201dPrison officials won\u2019t address the allegations in the lawsuits, saying they don\u2019t comment on pending litigation."}
