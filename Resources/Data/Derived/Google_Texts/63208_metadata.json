The state exchange, BeWellNM, said a total of 55,000 people bought private health insurance this year, including those who renewed their existing coverage. That number was 53,000 in 2015, for a 3.8 percent increase.\n\nWhile the number of enrollees increased, an exchange spokeswoman said there are several reasons why people go on and off the exchange each year.\n\nFor example, individuals might find a job with employer-paid insurance, qualify for dependent coverage or leave the state, said Linda Wedeen.\n\nOthers enroll with Medicaid or Medicare or purchase directly from the health insurer a type of plan that\u2019s not offered through the exchange.\n\nAcross the country, 40 percent of the 12.7 million people who signed up for health care coverage between Nov. 1 and Feb. 1, were new to the marketplace, said HHS.\n\nPeople in New Mexico who switched insurance plans saved an average of $56 per month, or nearly $676 annually for the same level of coverage.\n\nAs with past years, the vast majority of qualified people who looked at the online marketplace ended up signing up for coverage and received tax credits. In New Mexico, the average tax credit was $205 per month, or 62 percent of the gross premium. The average premium after tax credits was $127 per month.\n\nIn New Mexico, 50 percent of customers had the option of selecting a 2016 marketplace plan with a premium of $75 or less per month after tax credits, according to HHS.", "article_metadata": {"description": "ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. \u2014 About 40 percent of the New Mexicans who selected a health insurance marketplace plan during the 2016 open enrollment period were new customers, according to the U.S. Department of Health\u2026", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Steve Sinovic | Journal Staff Writer", "og": {"url": "http://www.abqjournal.com/741005/nm-health-insurance-sign-ups-rise-nearly-4-percent.html", "image": "http://www.abqjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/overhaul1.jpeg", "type": "website", "description": "About 40 percent of the New Mexicans who selected a health insurance marketplace plan during the 2016 open enrollment period were new customers, according to the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services.
