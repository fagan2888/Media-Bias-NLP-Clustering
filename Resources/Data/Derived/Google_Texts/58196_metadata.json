Too many people wanted to stop and speak with him. \u201cThe problem was he created more traffic problems,\u201d said Altman, smiling.\n\nThe church eventually gave him other jobs, and now he and his wife, Lauren Dungy, are there every weekend, greeting people and getting involved any way they can.\n\n\u201cThey believe in a local church,\u201d Altman said Saturday morning before the Dungys took the stage at the church to talk about their newest book, \u201cUncommon Marriage.\u201d\n\nThe couple is so loyal to their \u201chome church\u201d that they made a special stop there during their book tour to share advice and lessons they learned during 31 years of marriage.\n\nThe couple have an uncommon marriage, Lauren Dungy told the crowd of about 1,000 people. But it\u2019s not a perfect one.\n\n\u201cWe certainly aren\u2019t marriage experts,\u201d she said.\n\nDuring their talk, the couple spoke about how they maintained their relationship as they moved around the country for Tony Dungy\u2019s job as an NFL player and coach while also raising nine children. They have a designated date night every week, and nights designated to spending time as a family.\n\n\u201cYou have to really emphasize putting energy into that marriage,\u201d Tony Dungy told the crowd.\n\nTony Dungy was head coach of the Bucs from 1996 until 2001. Then, while his family remained in Tampa, he became head coach of the Indianapolis Colts, where in 2007 he became the first black head coach to lead a team to a Super Bowl victory. He retired from coaching in 2009 and now works as an analyst for NBC\u2019s \u201cFootball Night in America.\u201d\n\nLauren Dungy said she was her husband\u2019s biggest fan, whether he won or lost a game. And though it\u2019s harder to forgive your spouse than it is to forgive a friend or a co-worker, holding onto grudges and arguing about little things doesn\u2019t help a marriage. Fighting never gets a couple anywhere, she said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve given him the silent treatment, but it doesn\u2019t work,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it bothers him.\u201d\n\nTony Dungy said he was speaking directly to the men in the room when he took the podium, after surprising his wife with a bouquet of roses and a photo montage of their years together.\n\nA successful marriage takes more than flowers, he said, although those are important. Be willing to make sacrifices for your family, he told the crowd, and instead of complaining or being critical, encourage your wife to be a better person and she will do the same in return.\n\n\u201cMake those halftime adjustments and you can become the Christ-like husband that God intended you to be,\u201d Tony Dungy said.\n\nThe 218-page \u201cUncommon Marriage,\u201d is not the first book for either of the Dungys. Tony Dungy has written three other books and Lauren Dungy authored a bestselling children\u2019s book.\n\nThey enjoyed working on this latest book together, Tony Dungy said after the discussion.\n\n\u201cIt brought back a lot of memories,\u201d he said. \u201cWe really talked about what was important.\u201d\n\nIn the book, the couple addresses everything from Tony Dungy\u2019s demanding career and public scrutiny, to adoption and how the suicide of their eldest son affected their marriage.\n\nThey wanted to \u201cput themselves out there\u201d and be transparent about their marriage in hopes they could help other couples experiencing the same things, Lauren Dungy said.\n\n\u201cWe just wanted to show people that marriage is valuable, it is doable and it is worthwhile,\u201d Tony Dungy said.\n\nEbehrman@Tampatrib.com\n\n(813)259-7691\n\nTwitter: @LizBehrmanTBO", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sat, 08 Feb 2014 19:54:53 -0400", "Description": "TAMPA \u2014 When former Tampa Bay Buccaneers coach Tony Dungy began volunteering at Grace Family Church in Lutz, the staff at first asked him to help direct traffic before and after worship service", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "TAMPA \u2014 When former Tampa Bay Buccaneers coach Tony Dungy began volunteering at Grace Family Church in Lutz, the staff at first asked him to help direct traffic before and after worship service", "title": "Dungys speak about their \u2018Uncommon Marriage\u2019", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/news/breaking-news/all/tony-lauren-dungy-speak-about-their-uncommon-marriage-20140208/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140208/ARTICLE/140209373/AR/0/AR-140209373.jpg", "height": 410}, "updated_time": "2014-02-08T22:22:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "TAMPA \u2014 When former Tampa Bay Buccaneers coach Tony Dungy began volunteering at Grace Family Church in Lutz, the staff at first asked him to help direct traffic before and after worship servi", "title": "Dungys speak about their \u2018Uncommon Marriage\u2019", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140208/ARTICLE/140209373/AR/0/AR-140209373.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2014-02-08T19:54:53Z-04", "modified_time": "2014-02-08T22:22:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce187\"", "article_summary": "The couple have an uncommon marriage, Lauren Dungy told the crowd of about 1,000 people.\n\u201cYou have to really emphasize putting energy into that marriage,\u201d Tony Dungy told the crowd.\n\u201cWe just wanted to show people that marriage is valuable, it is doable and it is worthwhile,\u201d Tony Dungy said.\nThe 218-page \u201cUncommon Marriage,\u201d is not the first book for either of the Dungys.\n\u201cMake those halftime adjustments and you can become the Christ-like husband that God intended you to be,\u201d Tony Dungy said."}
