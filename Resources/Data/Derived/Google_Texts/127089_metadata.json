Li Research Professor of Economics, was awarded the Presidential medal\u2014Order of Brilliant Star with Violet Grand Cordon\u2014by Taiwan President Mr. Ma Ying-jeou at a March 17, 2015 ceremony at the Presidential Palace. Hsiao was cited for his contribution in establishing Taiwan\u2019s widely praised National Health Insurance (NHI) system.\n\nOne of the world\u2019s leading experts on designing health care systems, Hsiao was chief adviser and led a task force that designed Taiwan\u2019s system, implemented in 1995. Today, 99.9% of Taiwan\u2019s 23 million citizens have comprehensive health coverage, including dental care, vision care, medications, home visiting nurses\u2014everything except long-term care. \u201cThey have truly universal coverage and access to high-quality health care,\u201d said Hsiao, \u201ceven for people living in very remote areas and prisoners. At the same time, they are able to keep their costs under control through a single-payer system.\u201d\n\nAt Taiwan\u2019s request, Hsiao and colleagues evaluated the system\u2019s successes and weaknesses at its 10-year anniversary, and they are doing so again for its 20th. Hsiao said that while Taiwan has done much right, there is still work to do because disease patterns have changed, medical technology has improved, the population is aging, and people\u2019s health expectations have changed. \u201cThe strength of Taiwan and some other countries is that they want competent and impartial outsiders to evaluate their health systems, based on evidence, and say how they should move forward,\u201d he said.\n\nHsiao has helped numerous countries improve their health systems, including Cyprus, Colombia, China, Sweden, Poland, South Africa, and Uganda. The state of Vermont also commissioned him to design a single-payer system.\n\nLearn more\n\nThe art of getting things done (Harvard Public Health magazine)\n\n\u2013 Karen Feldscher", "article_metadata": {"copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The President and Fellows of Harvard College", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "msapplication-TileColor": "#A51C30", "fb": {"admins": "14102788,173700233,100001178456994", "pages": 166496921771}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/wp-content/themes/hsph/images/ms/ms-tile-icon.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Hsiao has helped numerous countries improve their health systems, including Cyprus, Colombia, China, Sweden, Poland, South Africa, and Uganda.\nToday, 99.9% of Taiwan\u2019s 23 million citizens have comprehensive health coverage, including dental care, vision care, medications, home visiting nurses\u2014everything except long-term care.\nOne of the world\u2019s leading experts on designing health care systems, Hsiao was chief adviser and led a task force that designed Taiwan\u2019s system, implemented in 1995.\n\u201cThey have truly universal coverage and access to high-quality health care,\u201d said Hsiao, \u201ceven for people living in very remote areas and prisoners.\nHsiao was cited for his contribution in establishing Taiwan\u2019s widely praised National Health Insurance (NHI) system."}
