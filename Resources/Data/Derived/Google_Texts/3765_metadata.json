We have proof for 2012 in two recent reports.\n\nIn 2012, total medical expenses increased just 2 percent in Massachusetts, according to the state Center for Health Information and Analysis (CHIA).\n\nThat same year, the average premium increase for large employers who don\u2019t self-insure was between 4 and 10 percent.\n\nSo should health insurers have compensated us last year, in 2013, or in our 2014 rates?\n\n\n\nNinety percent of premiums are based on medical expenses, CHIA Director Aron Boros says, \u201cso if plans are seeing that their medical expenditures are growing at about 2 percent, you\u2019d expect that to be roughly reflected in the premiums.\u201d If, he continues, \u201cpremiums are growing faster than that, then there are things at work that the plans should be able to explain.\u201d\n\nTufts Health Plan says premiums are set well in advance of when they actually take effect, are based on historical data, and anticipate costs but are still a challenge to predict.\n\nTufts collected too much money in 2012 and reimbursed members $33.4 million. Harvard Pilgrim sent back $13.5 million. Blue Cross Blue Shield did not issue a rebate for the second year in a row. Insurers are allowed to keep 10 percent of premiums. They only have to reimburse members if they have money left over after subtracting that 10 percent.\n\nOK, reimbursements to members begin to explain the gap between what we spent and what we paid in 2012, but doesn\u2019t account for all of it.\n\nAnd what if the gap is bigger than it looks?\n\nNancy Turnbull, an associate dean at the Harvard School of Public Health, says \u201cwe should be seeing health insurance premiums rise by less than total medical expenses\u201d. That\u2019s the 2 percent mentioned above.\n\nWhy? Because most employers are saving money by buying plans with higher co-pays and deductibles and the like. As we patients take on a bigger share of total medical expenses, then the share paid by premiums should shrink, right?\n\nThe gap between actual spending and premiums wasn\u2019t so great for all employers, says Eric Linzer, senior vice president for the Massachusetts Association of Health Plans.\n\nHe points out that the starting point for small businesses was between 2 and 4 percent in 2012, depending on the firm\u2019s renewal date. Fine, but few, if any, employers pay the starting or \u201cbase\u201d rate. Many small businesses reported increases well above 10 percent in 2012. And keep in mind that small employers are a modest segment of the total insurance market.\n\nNationally, it looks like health care spending has hit a plateau and is not rising as fast as overall economic growth. I know insurers base premiums on multi-year cycles, looking at trends. So is four years of largely flat growth enough of a trend? Are patients starting to spend more money now on care? If insurers are seeing this, no one mentioned it.\n\nRick Lord, the CEO at Associated Industries of Massachusetts, says he\u2019s optimistic about the CHIA report \u201cand would hope that in the next year or two that would be reflected in the premiums.\u201d\n\nLord says a practice hospitals have of inflating what they charge private insurers to make up for low government insurance reimbursement rates may be one reason that private insurance continues to go up more than actual expenses.\n\nAnd Phil Edmundson, who runs the brokerage firm William Gallagher Associates, says \u201cinsurers will seek larger price increases when the economy is better, when they feel that corporations are less price sensitive.\u201d So that might also explain the gap in 2012.\n\nThen finally, suggest employers, it may be that CHIA\u2019s numbers aren\u2019t completely accurate; this is a preliminary report.\n\nBut there are other signs that the pace of health care spending is down. Take a look at this slide from the state\u2019s Health Policy Commission. It shows that personal health care expenditures grew slower than the state economy as a whole. These numbers would not translate directly to lower premiums because they include health spending outside of our medical expenses. Still, it makes me wonder, do we have health care spending under control and we just don\u2019t know it?\n\nThe state\u2019s health care cost control law requires all kinds of new reporting and reviews and analysis of how we spend money on medicine in Massachusetts. But its success will be measured in our premiums. Is the law going to save money for you, me, employers, towns and the state?\n\nWe have to make sure that all the claims of savings and efficiencies translate into lower cost but still good-quality health insurance.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In 2012, total medical expenses increased just 2 percent in Massachusetts, but the average premium increase was between 4 and 10 percent.", "og": {"site_name": "commonhealth", "description": "In 2012, total medical expenses increased just 2 percent in Massachusetts, but the average premium increase was between 4 and 10 percent.", "title": "Health Care Spending Is Down, Why Aren\u2019t Our Premiums?", "url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2014/01/health-care-spending-premiums", "image": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/15/files/2014/01/0116_health-spending-620x456.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2014/01/health-care-spending-premiums", "image": "//s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/15/files/2014/01/0116_health-spending-620x456.jpg", "site": "@commonhealth", "card": "summary", "title": "Health Care Spending Is Down, Why Aren't Our Premiums?"}, "DC.date.issued": "2014-01-16", "msvalidate.01": "D02D46BAEDB3F81FC1B1DE2A8CB69551", "fb": {"admins": 1549080028, "app_id": 134067973330252}, "date": "Thu, 16 Jan 2014 18:42:59 -0500"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9653\"", "article_summary": "Health Care Spending Is Down, Why Aren\u2019t Our Premiums?\nI ask because health care spending is down \u2014 or is at least not rising as fast as our premiums.\nStill, it makes me wonder, do we have health care spending under control and we just don\u2019t know it?\nNationally, it looks like health care spending has hit a plateau and is not rising as fast as overall economic growth.\nBut there are other signs that the pace of health care spending is down."}
