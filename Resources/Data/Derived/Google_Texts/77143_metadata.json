But there\u2019s male breast cancer, too, and though it\u2019s about 100 times less common than the type that affects women, over 2,000 American men are diagnosed with it every year; 430 of these won\u2019t survive.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recently made an announcement to increase awareness about male breast cancer, calling for more volunteers in order to boost research efforts and improve treatment options for men. Only one percent of diagnosed breast cancer cases will be among men every year, but it will require more research to develop more treatments tailored to males. Typically, both female and male breast cancer patients are treated through chemotherapy, but physicians still aren\u2019t entirely sure whether men respond differently due to hormonal differences.\n\n\u201cMale breast cancer [has] never had an important lobby,\u201d Dr. Marleen Meyers, an assistant professor at NYU Langone Medical Center, told The Daily Beast. \u201c[It\u2019s] a less known and less spoken about breast cancer.\u201d\n\nAll males have nonfunctioning breast tissue, meaning it cannot produce milk but is still subject to breast cancer. A common symptom of male breast cancer is a firm and non-painful mass just below the nipple, and this can irritate the skin around it, causing ulcerations, puckering or dimpling, as well as redness around the nipple. But men are less likely to be aware of, or check for, breast cancer symptoms. \u201cYou\u2019d think that because men have smaller breasts they would notice a lump instantly,\u201d Dr. Tatiana Prowell, a breast cancer scientific lead at the FDA\u2019s Office of Hematology & Oncology Products, said in an FDA news release. \u201cBut men don\u2019t expect a breast lump to be cancer, whereas most women who feel a breast lump immediately assume the worst.\u201d\n\nMen who are excluded from breast cancer clinical trials often miss out on new, experimental drugs or treatments for the cancer, decreasing their likelihood to survive. \u201cMen have historically been excluded from breast cancer trials,\u201d Prowell said in the FDA news release, mostly because many drugs are tailored to women and their hormones. \u201cWe are actively encouraging drug companies to include men in all breast cancer trials until there is a valid scientific reason not to.\u201d\n\nShe continued: \u201cJust as the FDA, NIH, and other organizations encourage accrual of all underrepresented populations in trials \u2014 women, racial minorities, and children, for example \u2014 we have begun routinely encouraging companies to include men with breast cancer in breast cancer trials.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "male breast cancer", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Male breast cancer is 100 times less common than female breast cancer, but it\u2019s important enough for the FDA to begin recruiting more volunteers for research opportunities.", "title": "Male Breast Cancer Doesn\u2019t Get The Attention It Needs", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/fda-requests-more-volunteers-male-breast-cancer-research-hopes-boost-awareness-about-disease-293476", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/16/male-breast-cancer.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Male breast cancer is 100 times less common than female breast cancer, but it\u2019s important enough for the FDA to begin recruiting more volunteers for research opportunities.", "title": "Male Breast Cancer Doesn\u2019t Get The Attention It Needs", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/fda-requests-more-volunteers-male-breast-cancer-research-hopes-boost-awareness-about-disease-293476", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/16/male-breast-cancer.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/16/male-breast-cancer.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Conditions", "published_time": "2014-07-16T16:45:29-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-16T16:45:28-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Male breast cancer is 100 times less common than female breast cancer, but it\u2019s important enough for the FDA to begin recruiting more volunteers for research opportunities."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf861\"", "article_summary": "Breast cancer is commonly known to be a primarily female battle, complete with pink ribbons aiming to raise awareness.\n\u201cMale breast cancer [has] never had an important lobby,\u201d Dr. Marleen Meyers, an assistant professor at NYU Langone Medical Center, told The Daily Beast.\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recently made an announcement to increase awareness about male breast cancer, calling for more volunteers in order to boost research efforts and improve treatment options for men.\n\u201c[It\u2019s] a less known and less spoken about breast cancer.\u201dAll males have nonfunctioning breast tissue, meaning it cannot produce milk but is still subject to breast cancer.\nTypically, both female and male breast cancer patients are treated through chemotherapy, but physicians still aren\u2019t entirely sure whether men respond differently due to hormonal differences."}
