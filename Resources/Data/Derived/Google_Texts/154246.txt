This is either the creepiest and best thing that could possibly happen for fans of “The Walking Dead.” Dock Street Brewing Company out of Philadelphia has revealed their Walker brew, inspired by the show.

The American Pale Stout is brewed with cranberries … and brains. That’s right, one of the ingredients in the beer is roasted goat brains, making it zombie-approved. As for how that effects the taste of the beer, that remains to be seen. At least the brains are roasted.

Beer enthusiasts will get their first chance to try Dock Street Walker at the Philadelphia brewery on March 30, when they screen the season finale of “The Walking Dead.” Maybe one day fans will be able to purchase it without making a trek to Pennsylvania.
