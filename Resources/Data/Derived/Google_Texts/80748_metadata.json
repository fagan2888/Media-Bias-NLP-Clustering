The frontrunners are incumbent Democrat Jeff Merkley and Republican Monica Wehby.\n\nKristian Foden-Vencil/OPB\n\nOn a recent Saturday morning in Portland, Jeff Merkley met with volunteers at one of his offices.\n\nRetiree Carol Adler was there to show her support.\n\n\u201cI just think he\u2019s terrific. I\u2019ve been volunteering a bit here and I had a house party for him where I live,\u201d Adler said.\n\nTwenty-five miles south, at the Clackamas County Fair, Monica Wehby is shaking hands with people when 26-year-old Kevin Moss hands her a campaign donation.\n\nKristian Foden-Vencil/OPB\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s genuine. You look in her eyes and you can see the sincerity that she cares. Very few politicians, if any, can do that.\u201d\n\nWhile they both might enjoy the kudos on the campaign trail, Wehby and Merkley are two very different candidates.\n\nThey have separate views on business, international trade and the role of government.\n\nWhat exactly Wehby wants to do became a little fuzzy last week, after news organizations pointed out she had copied large portions of her website from Karl Rove and other Republicans. In response, her campaign pulled down the \u201cissues\u201d section of her site.\n\nKristian Foden-Vencil/OPB\n\nWhat we do know, is that Wehby is a neurosurgeon and the Director of Pediatric Neurosurgery at Randall Children\u2019s Hospital. She says she\u2019s running to help small businesses, among others.\n\n\u201cUncertainty about government regulation, government interference in their business. What taxes are there going to be? How are they going to change. All sorts of issues that are going on that are making it difficult for our business owners to continue to grow their practices and hire people,\u201d Wehby said.\n\nAccording to her website, Wehby is endorsed by the National Federation of Independent Business and the National Rifle Association. She\u2019s also raised more than $2 million.\n\nKristian Foden-Vencil\n\nJeff Merkley has raised almost $7 million. His website says he has the endorsement of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare and the American Federation of Teachers.\n\nLike Wehby, Merkley says he also has problems with government interference in business. But for him, that interference revolves around the loss of family wage jobs and corporate tax subsidies.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been off-shoring those jobs for subsidies,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThat is illogical to subsidize your competition overseas. We have to end that. We need to nurture manufacturing. We need to increase our investment in education. These things that are going to pay off and allow families to thrive,\u201d he explained.\n\nWhat Wehby and Merkley can agree on is the need to reduce the federal deficit. She lays the blame for it at the feet of Democrats and Oregon\u2019s incumbent senator.\n\n\u201cYou know Senator Merkley believes that the answer to everything is bigger government, more government control, more regulations,\u201d said Wehby.\n\nBut Merkley says that\u2019s not how he sees things.\n\n\u201cThis deficit is a direct result of the Bush Administration polices that blew up the economy. I\u2019m determined that we eliminate it. Go back to the equivalent of the Clinton Administration where we were running a surplus. Under the last five years we\u2019ve cut the deficit to roughly a third about 35 percent of its peak,\u201d Merkley says.\n\nSo far, much of the campaign debate has centered on outside money and in particular funding for ads like one released by the Freedom Partners Action Fund.\n\nMerkley talks a lot about the group\u2019s ties to the conservative Koch Brothers.\n\n\u201cThe Koch Brothers values are the absolute opposite of our Oregon values,\u201d said Merkley.\n\n\u201cNow they have laid out an agenda. She\u2019s signed onto eight items in their agenda. She\u2019s done so in writing. But these are not values that serve us well.\u201d\n\nWehby\u2019s response?\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t control who comes into the races, what super PACs get involved. We have no communication with these people,\u201d she says.\n\nIn answer to the ad, Merkley says he\u2019s authored numerous pieces of legislation that have become law including the Volcker Rule, which banned certain banks from making big bets; and the Water Infrastructure Financing and Innovation Act \u2014 to help communities fund water repairs. He also points to his efforts to change mortgage laws and predatory lending practices.\n\nFor her part, Wehby says her experience as a physician makes her uniquely suited to deal with changes to the health care system. She\u2019s been a staunch critic of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIn addition to Wehby and Merkley, there are three other candidates listed on November\u2019s ballot: James Leuenberger with the Constitution Party; Christina Lugo of the Pacific Green Party and Mike Montchalin of the Libertarian Party.\n\nNone of them have reported any activity with the Federal Election Commission.", "article_metadata": {"author": "Kristian Foden-Vencil", "og": {"url": "http://www.opb.org/news/article/on-the-campaign-trail-with-wehby-and-merkley/", "image": "http://www.opb.org/images/upload/c_fill,h_300,q_90,w_400/091914_MerkleyWehby_eiw0nu.jpg", "description": "One of Oregon's two senate seats is up for grabs this election season.
