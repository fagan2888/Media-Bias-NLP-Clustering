A local high school football game postponed for a potential threat took the field on Sunday.

El Dorado hosted Augusta two days after a game was called off for a tweet saying, "we will strike our first target tonight at the football game."

Fans say talk of the social media threat floated around the stadium.

"I just heard there was going to be the first hit at that game," said Augusta parent Michelle Hooglugt.

The El Dorado school district was told about the tweet Friday afternoon. District officials tell KAKE News they didn't have enough time to look into the validity of the threat, so the Friday night game was postponed.

"I believe they acted properly," said El Dorado parent Chris Hunt. "I'd hate to see somebody get hurt or something happen here while we're trying to have fun."

"I was pretty mad of course, but as long as everyone was safe I thought it'd be cool." said El Dorado student Jacob Harding.

Later on, the same twitter account posted 'I in fact did not call a bomb threat, that was someone else this is just a page where we pull pranks." Those at the game said this joke isn't funny.

"I was glad it was canceled, it was safety first for our boys," said Hooglugt.

More officers were placed on duty outside of the stadium for the game on Sunday, but fans tell KAKE News they didn't feel safety was at risk.

"I don't have a problem coming here and you can see how many people showed up," said Hunt

As the Augusta Orioles rallied and took a commanding lead, fans say the outcome was overshadowed by support.

"The whole community showed up, not only El Dorado but Augusta as well," said Hunt.

"I mean it's not the same as a Friday of course, but I think we got some good numbers out and I think we're still pretty spirited." said Harding.

KAKE News called the El Dorado Police Department to ask about potential charges for the person who made this threat, but we're told investigators can't get back to us until the morning.
