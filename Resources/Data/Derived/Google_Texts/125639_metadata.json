Here are a few themes and questions that we\u2019ve heard so far in the lounge.\n\nGetting started with a communications strategy: Social Media Lounge attendees receive a worksheet of Forrester Research\u2019s POST Strategy : People, Objectives, Strategy, Technology. Often people jump to the shiny new tool, but it\u2019s important to start with the audiences you\u2019re trying to reach and meet them where they are. We also have copies of the NMAC Workbook \u201cHIV Prevention Goes Social\u201d on hand which goes more in depth into social media planning Managing time/staff for social media: Many organizations have limited resources and time to dedicate to social media. We\u2019ve shared some nifty tools out there to save time. For example, we use tweet scheduling in Hootsuite to post tweets when we aren\u2019t available to tweet them live. Hootsuite also gives a quick glance across social media channels without having to log in to each. Measuring and evaluating: Once a communications strategy is in place and measurement goals are set, we recommend taking the time to evaluate your efforts. Every evaluation is different based on what matters to an organization. We\u2019ve given examples how we report and measure our social media, including guiding attendees to this blog post.\n\nOur team has really enjoyed these conversations in the lounge that help us better understand the many ways that you, the HIV community, are using social media. Ramon Garcia of AltaMed Health Services commented \u201cthis is the conversation I wanted to have; I needed to talk to someone to bounce ideas off of.\u201d We want to thank our partners from NASTAD and the API Wellness Center who helped us provide technical assistance in the lounge this week. We are hosting the lounge through the end of the conference, so it\u2019s not too late to stop by on Wednesday.\n\nIf you or your organization have a story that you\u2019d like to share on the blog, let us know in the comments.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "blog.aids.gov \u2014 HIV Policy & Programs.
