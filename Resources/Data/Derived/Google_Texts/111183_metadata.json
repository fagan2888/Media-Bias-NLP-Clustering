Ely said Cabot fought hard and \u201cboxed them in,\u201d limiting the evidence his pro bono attorney, Leslie Lewis could introduce and restricted what Ely could say in testimony.\n\n\u201cThey are an arrogant company that bullies their way to what they want. If they had just done the right thing, it would have been so much easier for them,\u201d said Ely.\n\nGeorge Stark, Cabot spokesman, said the company was surprised by the verdict\u2019s outcome, asserting that there was not evidence of contamination linking the Ely and Hubert family wells to their fracking operation.\n\nStark said, \u201cCabot will be filing motions with the court to set the verdict aside based on the lack of evidence as well as conduct of plaintiff\u2019s counsel calculated to deprive Cabot of a fair trial.\u201d\n\nOver 40 families previous the Elys and Huberts had additionally sued Cabot.

The film features visuals such as local residents being able to ignite their tap water on fire due the extremely high amount of methane in their water supply.\n\nCabot lawyer Stephen Dillard argued that methane occurs naturally and was not caused by the company\u2019s drilling operation. The ground water, while aesthetically displeasing, was nonetheless safe to drink, he contented.\n\nSource: Pennsylvania families win $4.2 million damages in fracking lawsuit\n\nPhoto credit:www.nofrackingway.us\n\nJoin the Discussion", "article_metadata": {"description": "$4.2 Million in Fracking Damages Given to PA Families as the fracking operation by Cabot Oil & Gas contaminated their ground water.", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Eric Needs", "og": {"site_name": "Legal Reader", "description": "$4.2 Million in Fracking Damages Given to PA Families as the fracking operation by Cabot Oil & Gas contaminated their ground water.", "title": "$4.2 Million in Fracking Damages Given to PA Families - Legal Reader", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.legalreader.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/07-contaminated-tap-water-670.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-03-17T13:55:48+00:00", "url": "http://www.legalreader.com/4-2-million-fracking-damages-given-pa-families/", "type": "article"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "fb": {"app_id": 1598871133679697}, "article": {"publisher": "http://facebook.com/thelegalreader", "section": "News & Politics", "published_time": "2016-03-12T11:58:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-17T13:55:48+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "On Thursday, a federal jury granted $4.2 million in fracking damages given to PA families, who said the fracking operation by Cabot Oil & Gas contaminated their ground water.\nSource: Pennsylvania families win $4.2 million damages in fracking lawsuitPhoto credit:www.nofrackingway.usJoin the Discussion\nThe ground water, while aesthetically displeasing, was nonetheless safe to drink, he contented.\nScot Ely and Monica Marta-Ely of Dimock, PA were awarded $1.3 million each by six jurors in a Scranton federal court.\nDimock, PA became a notable location for the fracking controversy from its appearance in the 2010 documentary \u201cGasland\u201d by Josh Fox."}
