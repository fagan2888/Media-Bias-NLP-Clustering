For three months, the Baltimore accountant lay teetering on the edge of death until surgeons found him a new heart, from a 16-year-old girl who had died in a motorcycle accident.\n\nFelice\u2019s operation was the third heart transplant performed at Johns Hopkins Hospital. Since then, side effects from his anti-rejection drugs have caused Felice to undergo a kidney transplant and numerous skin cancer operations.\n\nOn the most important score, however, Felice has beaten the odds: He\u2019s had 30 years with a stranger\u2019s heart beating in his chest, making him one of the longest-lived heart transplant patients.\n\nContrast Felice\u2019s story with that of 63-year-old Chris Einhorn. Three decades after Felice\u2019s transplant, Einhorn was out drinking coffee at a Starbucks in Rockville, Md., when Johns Hopkins called to say her new heart was ready for her. That night she underwent surgery, and she left the hospital nine days later. Soon she was on her feet and playing with her grandson.\n\nFelice and Einhorn are both success stories. But Einhorn was in relatively good health when she received her transplant, because for the previous 17 months her native heart had been getting a boost from a left ventricular assist device, or LVAD \u2014 a machine that has transformed prospects for patients with serious congestive heart failure.\n\nIncreasingly, such devices sustain people, including most notably former Vice President Dick Cheney, who probably would have died before they could receive a transplant. And the support the devices provide often allows patients to recover faster after they do get a new heart. Felice, without use of an LVAD, had to spend a month in the hospital after his transplant.\n\nOF FACT, FICTION AND DEFIBRILLATORS In a chilling episode of \u201cHomeland\u201d last year, a terrorist killed the vice president with a fiendish weapon: a remote-control device that attacked the computerized defibrillator implanted in his chest. For former Vice President Dick Cheney, it was all too realistic. Cheney, who had heart disease for decades before receiving a transplant last year, had such an implant to regulate his heart rate and shock his heart back into life, if necessary. The defibrillator could be reprogrammed wirelessly from a short distance away. In 2007, he had the wireless feature disabled. About the \u201cHomeland\u201d scenario, Cheney said on an Oct. 20 episode of \u201c60 Minutes\": \u201cI found it credible. It was an accurate portrayal of what was possible.\u201d But was it really? Medical experts say the answers are surprisingly complicated. The devices, used by millions of Americans, transmit data from a patient\u2019s home to a doctor\u2019s office, alerting the doctor of a malfunction. But the communication goes only one way; the devices being used today cannot be reprogrammed remotely. Instead, patients must go to a doctor\u2019s office. With some devices, they must be within inches of the reprogramming machine. Others can be reprogrammed from about 30 feet away, but a wand must be held close to patients\u2019 collarbones to identify them to the machine. \u201cMy opinion is it is probably unlikely that a remote attack of this nature could happen today,\u201d said Kevin Fu, a University of Michigan expert on computer security. Today, he and others said, the real risk with electronic medical devices is much more mundane. It is the accidental introduction of the disruptive software called malware. For example, Fu said, malware got into a pharmaceutical compounder, which controls the mixing of medications, at a hospital. Another time, malware got into a fetal monitor, making it slow down. In 2011 alone, the Department of Veterans Affairs reported nearly two dozen malware infections in its hospitals. \u2014 Gina Kolata, The New York Times\n\nMACHINES, NOT MEDICINES\n\nAs many as 500,000 people suffer heart failure in the United States each year. Yet the number of hearts available for transplant plateaued at around 2,500 in 1995. Medicine is getting better at transplanting hearts and the need for them is growing larger, but the number of organs available is static. So devices are filling some of that gap.\n\n\u201cThe whole field is being dominated today and tomorrow by LVAD and artificial hearts, and is becoming a problem of engineering, miniaturization and, believe it or not, batteries,\u201d says cardiologist Michael Hess, who directs the Pauley Heart Center\u2019s heart transplantation program at the Medical College of Virginia in Richmond. \u201cThe next big breakthrough is going to come out of MIT and not medicine.\u201d\n\nHe adds: \u201cWe can now take someone near death\u2019s door, put in a mechanical device, rehabilitate them over several months and improve their state of health, so that when they do have the transplant, they are in much better shape.\u201d That was what happened to Cheney, who was indeed at death\u2019s door, his heart and kidneys failing, in July 2010, when he was rushed into surgery to receive an LVAD. It restored his health to the point that he was able to receive a heart transplant 20 months later, at age 71.\n\nCaring for the heart has many dimensions, including diet, drugs, stents and bypass surgery. Transplantation was rare until the early 1980s, when the FDA approved cyclosporin, an immunosuppressant less damaging to the body than anti-rejection drugs used up to that point. In 1994, the FDA approved the first ventricular assist device, and in 2008 the agency approved the HeartMate II, the current leader in the LVAD market, as a bridge to keep patients healthy until transplantation. Another popular LVAD is made by Heartware International.\n\nThe 10-ounce LVAD contains a finger-size pump that pushes blood through the heart. LVADs drive a flow of blood through the heart continuously rather than in pulses. As a result, the patient usually does not have a measurable heartbeat, because the device is doing most of the pumping that the heart once did.\n\n\u201cAt the hospital they liked to call us the zombies,\u201d Einhorn said.\n\nUse of these devices has expanded quickly. In 2012, about 2,000 LVADS implantations were done \u2014 a tenfold increase over 2006 \u2014 and doctors say they expect the numbers to continue to sharply increase. A 2011 study suggested that 40,000 to 200,000 patients each year would benefit from either an LVAD or a heart transplant.\n\nVentricular assist devices \u2014 in addition to LVADs, there are units that support the right ventricle, or both sides of the heart \u2014 allow doctors to give transplants to older, sicker patients. When Felice got his new heart, 50 was the absolute upper age limit for transplant recipients, says his cardiologist Edward Kasper. Now, the absolute limit is 75. Hearts are a scarce resource, and doctors are reluctant to put them into people who aren\u2019t likely to live very long.\n\nCheney, who had suffered five heart attacks and undergone many surgeries, was one of the oldest patients at Virginia\u2019s Inova Fairfax Hospital ever to receive a new heart.\n\n\"Mechanical circulatory support has been a real game-changer. We\u2019ll be putting in more and more of them.\" \u2014 Nelson Burton, chief of heart and lung surgery at Inova Fairfax\n\n\u201cMechanical circulatory support has been a real game-changer,\u201d says Nelson Burton, chief of heart and lung surgery at Inova Fairfax. He says he implants twice as many LVADs as hearts these days, and \u201cI\u2019m sure that ratio will increase as the technology improves. We\u2019ll be putting in more and more of them.\u201d\n\nThe future points to a device industry making gadgets that guarantee longer lives without transplant. In 2012, 40 percent of LVAD recipients got their devices as \u201cdestination therapy,\u201d meaning they are permanent implants. Already, many LVAD recipients don\u2019t expect ever to receive a heart transplant. Some recipients of the HeartMate II have lived with it for eight years. The device theoretically could last in a patient for at least 17 years, according to Gary Burbach, chief executive of Thoratec, the company that makes it.\n\nA small percentage of LVAD patients have had the devices removed after their native hearts recovered sufficient function following a period attached to the pump.\n\nWORK IN PROGRESS\n\nUsing the device has drawbacks, including an increased risk of infection and blood clots. At best, the device is burdensome. Patients must carry a sling holding a power module and eight pounds of batteries that require recharging after a maximum of 14 hours; the patient is hooked up to a wall power unit at night. To prepare for a shower, patients with LVADs must carefully wrap themselves in plastic to guard against infection from the electrical leads that pass through their abdomens.\n\nBut a heart transplant also has medical and psychological costs.\n\nChris Einhorn was happy to get rid of her LVAD gear when she got her heart transplant in August, but adjusting to someone else\u2019s heart has had its ups and downs. Using the LVAD meant having to take a blood thinner but no immunosuppressants. Now she is on an antiviral drug required to prevent rejection of her new heart, as well as three types of immunosuppressants that cause tremor, indigestion and emotional swings. She had to be taken off a heart medicine that led to muscle spasms, and she is monitored daily to check her blood pressure, weight and signs of incipient diabetes, a frequent side effect of her high-dose steroid use.\n\nEinhorn, a well-informed and careful patient, says she\u2019s been doing well on the post-transplant drugs but finds it\u2019s a \u201cmixed emotional bag\u201d to be running on an organ that belonged to someone who died tragically.\n\n\u201cFor the most part, I am thrilled to be a recipient. I thank my donor every day,\u201d she says. \u201cIt makes you sad and happy at the same time, and very, very, very thankful.\u201d\n\nFor some patients, moving from an implant to a transplant would require too large a trade-off. Laura Huber of Aberdeen, S.D., received an LVAD in 2007 at age 26, after a virus or autoimmune reaction attacked her heart. She doesn\u2019t want a transplant, at least for now.\n\n\u201cThe device won\u2019t necessarily last forever,\u201d said Huber, who works as a physical therapist in a cardiology ward. \u201cBut the risks of a transplant, based on how well I\u2019ve been functioning for almost seven years \u2014 I don\u2019t see enough benefit to it.\u201d\n\nHuber\u2019s heart, like those of many VAD patients, continues to function at a minimal level, and she feels there\u2019s a glimmer of hope it will recover enough to have the device removed someday. Or perhaps, some years down the road, she can get an improved version of her current device.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t swim or do contact sports. I can\u2019t sit in a hot tub. But I play golf instead of basketball, and I don\u2019t really feel limited physically,\u201d she said.\n\nThe holy grail for Huber and other patients \u2014 as well as the device manufacturers \u2014 is a pump that would have no external wires, no external battery pack. Thoratec in 2012 licensed wireless electricity technology that would allow pump batteries to be charged through the skin. Burbach, the company\u2019s chief executive, says the device could be ready \u201cwithin a few years.\u201d Others expect it could take at least a decade.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2013/11/HEALTH-HEART292-cropHF.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}, "description": "Mechanical devices are improving the heart transplant, and may soon replace it"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdde89\"", "article_summary": "Cheney, who had heart disease for decades before receiving a transplant last year, had such an implant to regulate his heart rate and shock his heart back into life, if necessary.\nOn the most important score, however, Felice has beaten the odds: He\u2019s had 30 years with a stranger\u2019s heart beating in his chest, making him one of the longest-lived heart transplant patients.\nIt restored his health to the point that he was able to receive a heart transplant 20 months later, at age 71.\nChris Einhorn was happy to get rid of her LVAD gear when she got her heart transplant in August, but adjusting to someone else\u2019s heart has had its ups and downs.\n\u2014 Nelson Burton, chief of heart and lung surgery at Inova Fairfax\u201cMechanical circulatory support has been a real game-changer,\u201d says Nelson Burton, chief of heart and lung surgery at Inova Fairfax."}
