And given the mind-boggling myriad of government immigration rules and quotas, even people who try to play by the rules can find themselves stuck in a seemingly endless limbo, according to experts.\n\nA French national with a bachelor\u2019s degree and a U.S. employer\u2019s sponsorship may wait for two years or so to qualify for a green card to legally work in the United States. But another green card applicant from India with the same college degree and employer sponsorship likely must wait 11 years or more for that valuable visa.\n\nFor a resident of the Philippines who is seeking to join a sibling who is living in the U.S. as a naturalized citizen, the wait can be as long as 24 years \u2014 nearly a quarter of a century \u2014 if he or she is willing to wait that long or lives that long. And for the truly determined Filipino who hopes to make it all the way to U.S. citizenship, the waiting period could top 30 years.\n\nRelated: CEOs Say Government Inaction Has Hurt Jobs and Growth\n\nThe Agence France Press reported last year about a 58-year-old Filipino, Arnulfo Babiera, who applied for a U.S. green card a decade ago, hoping to be reunited with his sister who became a naturalized citizen in the U.S. But because there are so many requests from China, Mexico, India, and the Philippines, Babiera may have to wait until 2027 to get his green card.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be retired before he comes here, I think!\u201d his 56-year-old sister, Elizabeth Babiera, a nurse who lives in suburban Washington, told the news organization.\n\n\u201cThis idea of going to the back of the line sounds like a reasonable and simple thing to do, but it\u2019s complicated by the fact that there are so many lines \u2014 and for some people the line does not exist,\u201d Madeleine Sumption, a senior policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, told The Fiscal Times this week. \u201cThe idea that the people can simply get in the back of the line is a little bit simplistic in practice.\u201d\n\nRelated: 21 Surprising Facts About Illegal Immigration\n\nThe U.S. immigration law and policy grants permanent immigrant status to 675,000 people worldwide, with about 70 percent of those granted access because they have close relatives already legally living here, according to the American Immigration Council. Congress and the president determine a separate number of refugee admissions, according to the American Immigration Council.\n\nImmigration law is based on four overarching principles: the reunification of families, admitting immigrants who have skills that are valuable to the U.S. economy, protecting refugees, and promoting diversity.\n\nThe U.S. arguably has one of the more lenient set of laws for allowing foreigners to immigrate to this country; most other countries have tough laws that severely limit the number of immigrants in any year. But because the waiting periods are so onerous, the U.S. immigration system in practice is highly exclusionary.\n\nThere are an estimated 4.4 million people on waiting lists to qualify for family-based or employment visas to enter the U.S., with waiting times ranging on average from five years to 20 years. Experts say there are so many different types of visas and regulations \u2014 and so many peculiarities to the law and bureaucratic snafus \u2014 that discussing the length of lines is almost meaningless.\n\nRelated: Jeb Bush\u2019s Heretical View of Illegal Immigration\n\n\u201cThe lines are uniquely American unfortunately,\u201d said Sumption. \u201cThe U.S. is kind of torn between wanting to be generous, yet not wanting to be too generous \u2014 so putting a cap on the numbers. And that means that on paper U.S. laws pretend to give people the right to come to the country, but in practice they have to wait so long that many of them may as well not have that right.\u201d\n\nWilliam A. Galston, a former domestic policy adviser to President Bill Clinton, argues that while these long lines for foreigners playing by the rules is problematic, the more urgent challenge is addressing the plight of the 11.7 million illegal immigrants worried about deportation and the breakup of their families.\n\n\u201cI think that the important point about immigration reform \u2014 were it to occur \u2014 is that most of the people who are now in the shadows would not have to wait long \u2014 if at all \u2014 for a legal process to bring them out of the shadows, enable them to participate lawfully and more fully in the economy and in their local community life,\u201d he said yesterday.\n\nRelated: Schumer Calls Boehner\u2019s Bluff on Immigration Reform\n\nGalston, a government affairs scholar with the Brookings Institution, insists that any serious immigration reform proposal would have to include a requirement for a lengthy path to a green card or citizenship. \u201cThat is, politically speaking, the price of admission,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you can\u2019t affirm that, you\u2019re really not part of the serious debate.\u201d\n\nThe bipartisan immigration reform package passed by the Senate last year would establish a lengthy 13-year path to citizenship in which qualified undocumented immigrants are initially granted Registered Provisional Immigrant status for a decade and then are in Lawful Permanent Resident status for three additional years before they may apply to become naturalized citizens. The pathway includes a number of tough requirements \u2014 such as four separate background and criminal checks and payment of at least $2,000 in penalties plus application fees.\n\nThe bill includes a quicker path to citizenship for DREAMers \u2014 young people without status \u2014 and agricultural workers.\n\nHouse Republicans have spurned the Senate\u2019s comprehensive plan and insist that if they do anything this year \u2014 which seems increasingly unlikely \u2014 it would have to be done in a piecemeal approach, with nothing resembling \u201camnesty\u201d for illegal immigrants. While the House Judiciary Committee has voted out five bills, none of them directly addresses the plight of the 11.7 million undocumented immigrants.\n\nSpeaker John Boehner (R-OH) has said repeatedly that Republicans do not trust President Obama to enforce a broadly based immigration reform law. On Tuesday, the speaker said that the leadership was considering scheduling a separate floor vote on the ENLIST Act, according to Politico, a measure that would allow undocumented immigrants who entered the country before they were 15 years old to join the military and seek U.S. citizenship after they honorably complete their service.\n\nTop Reads From The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A political catch phrase of the prolonged immigration reform controversy in Congress is that, regardless of what changes eventually are hammered out, the more than 11 million undocumented residents in this country will have to \u201cgo to the end of the line\u201d to apply for permanent legal status or citizenship.
