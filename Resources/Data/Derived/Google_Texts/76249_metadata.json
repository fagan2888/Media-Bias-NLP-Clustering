Whereas before, doctors and hospitals could count on more money for doing more tests and procedures, now their financial future hinges on their ability to keep patients healthy and to slow the growth of the cost of their care.\n\n\n\nIndianapolis-based Anthem is already paying out more than $11 billion of the $38 billion its commercial health plans spend each year on medical claims via alternative or \u201cvalue-based\u201d programs, the company told investors last month.\n\n\n\nAdding in its Medicare and Medicaid health plans, Anthem is spending more than $25 billion in these new types of programs.\n\n\n\n\u201cI firmly believe that value-based payment models are absolutely going to be the new norm, if not already,\u201d said Amy Cheslock, Anthem\u2019s vice president of payment innovation. \u201cThis is not a fad, if you will.\"\n\n\n\nIn January, the Obamacare administration announced that Medicare program for seniors will make 30 percent of its spending hinge on these new payment programs by 2016, and 50 percent by 2018.\n\n\n\nOne type of these new payments is called a medical home, with insurers such as Anthem paying primary care doctors extra money to take some responsibility for all aspects of their patients\u2019 care, in what is called a medical home.\n\n\n\nIn Indiana, nearly 2,900 primary care providers are participating in that program, covering nearly 454,000 patients. Anthem pays each doctor about $3.50 per patient per month to cover the cost of the extra services they provide to keep patients healthy.\n\n\n\nAnother type of value-based payment goes to doctors and hospitals that have formed accountable care organizations. Those ACOs can earn bonuses, also known as \u201cshared savings\u201d payments, for proving the quality of their care and slowing growth in the collective cost of care for a specific group of patients.\n\n\n\nIn Indiana, Anthem has entered ACO agreements with Franciscan Alliance\u2019s hospitals statewide, the Indiana University Health hospital in Goshen and Saint Joseph Regional Medical Center in South Bend.\n\n\n\nAlso, Anthem has ACO-type shared savings agreements with 11 other health care providers, including the large physician practices of American Health Network, Community Physician Network and St. Vincent Health.\n\n\n\nAll told, Anthem\u2019s medical home, ACO and shared savings agreements have nearly 454,000 patients assigned to them.\n\n\n\nNationwide, Anthem has 37,000 health care providers in either a medical home or one of its 139 ACO agreements, with about 3.8 million patients assigned to them. That\u2019s equal to 13 percent of all of Anthem\u2019s customers in commercial health plans.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe nature of the value-based payment models is such that it is attractive for primary care physicians to participate in them,\u201d Cheslock said. \u201cThe best example of that is the pace at which we\u2019ve been able to move providers into these models.\u201d\n\n\n\nOther insurers are making similar progress, according to statistics compiled by Wedbush Securities.\n\n\n\nHartford-based Aetna Inc. has 62 ACO agreements covering 3.2 million patients or about 30 percent of all the claims it pays through its commercial health plans. Aetna has another 200 ACOs in the pipeline and wants 75 percent of its spending to go thorugh value-based programs by 2020.\n\n\n\nLouisville-based Humana Inc. has 54 percent of its health plans\u2019 members covered by accountable care organizations. It wants to push it to 75 percent by 2017.\n\n\n\nMinnesota-based UnitedHealth Group Inc. is spending $40 billion a year through its 520 ACOs and other value-based contracts. It wants to boost that spending to $65 billion by 2018.\n\n\n\nLastly, Philadelphia-based Cigna Corp. is working to expand on the 122 ACOs it has already.\n\n\n\nAnthem\u2019s Cheslock said she expects these payment programs to keep evolving. Anthem has structured most of its shared-savings contracts so that in the third or fourth or fifth year of the contract, health care providers can actually lose money if they don\u2019t keep costs down and quality up. But they can also earn even larger bonuses if they do.\n\n\n\nGoing even further, some health care providers are talking to Anthem about being paid a pre-set amount per patient per year\u2014a concept known as capitation. Capitation encourages doctors to keep costs lows\u2014because they get to keep whatever portion of the payment is left over at the end of the year. Or, if they spend more than the pre-set amount, the doctors take a loss.\n\n\n\nMedicare has advanced a similar concept through its Medicare Advantage plans, which are managed by private insurers like Anthem. Medicare Advantage now covers roughly one-third of all seniors, and many think it will become the standard for insurance payment in the future.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere is a warming sentiment toward capitation, and the opportunities it presents,\u201d Cheslock said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In tandem with the federal Medicare program, large private insurers such as Anthem Inc. are rapidly expanding the new ways they pay doctors and hospitals.
