"Well, as a spouse, you always want the person you love to come off the best that they can,” Kelley Paul said on NBC's “Today” show. “And so it’s hard for me sometimes to see him being criticized. Because that’s not who he is, in terms of his relationships with women.”

Last week, the Kentucky senator got into awith “Today” host Savannah Guthrie, accusing her of editorializing with questions about whether he has changed his position on foreign policy issues. “Today” anchor Hoda Kotb conducted the interview with Kelley Paul.

The senator also told a female CNBC anchor to "calm down" during an interview earlier this year, and at one point, put his finger to his mouth to “shush” her.

Kelley Paul noted that her ophthalmologist husband's longtime surgical partner had been a woman. She also noted the difficulty of giving live interviews.

"I hate to be overly critical, because now that I’m doing some of it myself, I realize how hard it is in the moment," Kelley Paul said.

Rand Paul has also addressed the sexism claims, saying he often spars with reporters.

“I will have to get better at holding my tongue, but I think I'm pretty equal opportunity," he said.
