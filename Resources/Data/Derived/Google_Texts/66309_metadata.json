Reuters\n\nWhen the students at West Orange High School in Florida were voting for their homecoming king and queen, they could only think of two classmates: Semone Adkins and Trazjuan \"Bubba\" Hunter. The couple affected by Down syndrome became the state of Florida\u2019s first homecoming pair with special needs on a night that no one will ever forget.\n\n\"This didn't happen because we feel sorry for them or something,\" Hayden Griffitts, quarterback of the high school football team, told the Orlando Sentinel. \"Just the opposite. They really deserve it. I mean, homecoming is about bringing people together and having fun. And that's what they do.\"\n\nAfter living down the street from each other their entire lives, the couple is now inseparable. In spite of their special needs, Semone and Trazjuan have different personalities.

Semone, dressed in a gorgeous brown dress, and Trazjuan, looking spiffy in his black tuxedo, waved to their fellow classmates, smiled for pictures, and received their ceremonial crowns and flowers to a standing ovation.\n\n\"I am so happy. Words cannot express what I am feeling right now. I am so proud of him,\" Trazjuan\u2019s mother, Janice Morgan, told WFTV. \"We love you guys.\"", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "down, syndrome, couple, homecoming, king, queen, semone, adkins, trazjuan, bubba, hunter", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A Florida couple with Down syndrome recently became the first pair with special needs to be named their high school's homecoming king and queen.", "title": "Couple With Down Syndrome Wins Homecoming King And Queen [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/couple-down-syndrome-wins-homecoming-king-and-queen-florida-high-school-receives-standing-ovation", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/10/15/special-needs-homecoming-king-and-queen.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A Florida couple with Down syndrome recently became the first pair with special needs to be named their high school's homecoming king and queen.", "title": "Couple With Down Syndrome Wins Homecoming King And Queen [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/couple-down-syndrome-wins-homecoming-king-and-queen-florida-high-school-receives-standing-ovation", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/10/15/special-needs-homecoming-king-and-queen.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/10/15/special-needs-homecoming-king-and-queen.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2013-10-15T12:25:50-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-15T12:25:49-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A Florida couple with Down syndrome recently became the first pair with special needs to be named their high school's homecoming king and queen."}, "article_summary": "A Florida couple with Down syndrome recently became the first pair with special needs to be named their high school's homecoming king and queen.\nThe couple affected by Down syndrome became the state of Florida\u2019s first homecoming pair with special needs on a night that no one will ever forget.\nIn spite of their special needs, Semone and Trazjuan have different personalities.\nReutersWhen the students at West Orange High School in Florida were voting for their homecoming king and queen, they could only think of two classmates: Semone Adkins and Trazjuan \"Bubba\" Hunter.\n\"This didn't happen because we feel sorry for them or something,\" Hayden Griffitts, quarterback of the high school football team, told the Orlando Sentinel."}
