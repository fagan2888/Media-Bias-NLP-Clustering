DURANGO, Colo. -- The head of the Environmental Protection Agency will be in southwest Colorado on Wednesday, one week since a mine wastewater spill soiled the Animas River.

EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy said the agency takes full responsibility for the spill, which happened when crew members struck a wall at the Gold King Mine north of Silverton and caused 3 million gallons of toxic waste to be discharged into Cement Creek before it flowed down the Animas.

A plume of iron, zinc and copper came surging through Durango, turning the river a dark orange and leaving an orange sludge behind along the river banks.

"It is really a tragic and very unfortunate incident, and EPA is taking responsibility to ensure that that spill is cleaned up," McCarthy said Tuesday. "I am absolutely, deeply sorry that this ever happened."

Also in Durango on Wednesday will be Colorado Attorney General Cynthia Coffman and the attorneys general from New Mexico and Durango. The attorneys general plan a public announcement in the afternoon.

It's unclear what the announcement will be.

McCarthy is expected to face tough questions regarding what the agency did or did not do and what it plans to do long term.

On Tuesday, Gov. John Hickenlooper met with Colorado Parks and Wildlife officials to look at fish cages in which young trout were put in before the sludge came through. All but one of the fish were alive, a good sign of a river on the mend.
