Graham will lead a nationwide prayer-focused tour in 2016 to encourage Christians to vote at the ballot box for candidates with biblical values.\n\n\u201cOur country is in trouble. And to be honest, I don\u2019t see any political solution,\u201d Graham stated. \u201cThe only hope for this country is in Almighty God and His Son Jesus Christ.\u201d\n\nThe eldest son of evangelical Rev. Billy Graham, Franklin Graham heads the Christian nonprofit Samaritan\u2019s Purse and the Billy Graham Evangelistic Society. He announced the \u201cDecision America Tour\u201d on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI will be going to the capitals of all 50 states to proclaim the Gospel, rally prayer for our country, and encourage Christians to vote for candidates with biblical values,\u201d Graham wrote in an announcement letter for the tour. \u201cTogether, we can mobilize the Church to not only get up and vote, but also to encourage Christians to run for political office at the local, state, and federal levels as well.\u201d\n\nThe tour will consist of a prayer rally held in each state, with a kick-off Jan. 5 at the Capitol building in the political campaign heartland of the 2016 presidential elections, Des Moines, Iowa.\n\n\u201cI have heard from people all over America who believe that our nation is in trouble\u2014morally, spiritually, and politically,\u201d Graham posted on his Facebook page. \u201cBut as attention turns to an election year, I do not believe that Republicans or Democrats (or any other party) can turn this nation around\u2014only God can.\u201d\n\nThe post continued:\n\nGod hears the prayers of his people, so I\u2019m calling on people of faith in every state to pray fervently for America and our leaders. I want to challenge Christians across our land to boldly live out and promote biblical principles at home, in public and at the ballot box. The only hope for this country is if the people of God are willing to take a stand for truth and righteousness.\n\nThe Decision America Tour website encourages Americans to pray, vote, and engage in their communities.\n\n\u201cWithout God, there\u2019s no hope,\u201d Graham, who has devoted his life to proclaiming the Gospel and has led crusades around the world, says in a video announcement of the tour.\n\nGraham will share and preach the \u201clife-changing truth of the Gospel of Jesus Christ\u201d in each state. The tour will not endorse candidates or a political party. Current public officials and candidates will not speak at the rallies.\n\n\u201cJoin me in praying for our country,\u201d Graham\u2019s announcement letter reads. \u201cIt\u2019s time to stand up and have our voice heard.\u201d\n\nAfter the first prayer rally held in Iowa, the tour will make stops in Florida on Jan. 12, Louisiana on Jan. 13, and New Hampshire on Jan. 19. Dates for the next stops are still to be announced.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Franklin Graham will lead a nationwide prayer-focused tour in 2016 to encourage Christians to vote at the ballot box for candidates with biblical values.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Franklin Graham will lead a nationwide prayer-focused tour in 2016 to encourage Christians to vote at the ballot box for candidates with biblical values.", "title": "Franklin Graham Announces 2016 Prayer Rally Tour", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151006_GrahamTour_Jessen.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-10-09T20:47:20+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1Qbw0tn"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Franklin Graham will lead a nationwide prayer-focused tour in 2016 to encourage Christians to vote at the ballot box for candidates with biblical values.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151006_GrahamTour_Jessen.jpg"}, "title": "Franklin Graham Announces 2016 Prayer Rally Tour", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "elections", "published_time": "2015-10-09T19:50:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-09T20:47:20+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Franklin Graham, Decision America Tour, 2016, prayer, election, vote"}, "article_summary": "Billy Graham, Franklin Graham heads the Christian nonprofit Samaritan\u2019s Purse and the Billy Graham Evangelistic Society.\nGraham will lead a nationwide prayer-focused tour in 2016 to encourage Christians to vote at the ballot box for candidates with biblical values.\nEvangelist Franklin Graham has called Christians to look towards God during a pivotal time in American election history.\nAnd to be honest, I don\u2019t see any political solution,\u201d Graham stated.\n\u201cThe only hope for this country is in Almighty God and His Son Jesus Christ.\u201dThe eldest son of evangelical Rev."}
