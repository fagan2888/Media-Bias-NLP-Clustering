REUTERS/Gary Cameron/Files\n\n4895304\n\nSenate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship Chairman David Vitter is questioning why Congress is able to get its health care through the Small Business Health Options Plan (SHOP) \u2014 which requires a business to have 50 or less employees \u2014 when the tax forms provided list Congress as a large employer.\n\nIn a letter written to Internal Revenue Service Commissioner John Koskinen Wednesday, the Louisiana Republican said it appears Congress is \u201cmisrepresenting itself to either DC Health Link or the IRS\u201d and questioned whether the contradiction violates the Internal Revenue Code.\n\nShould Every Member Of Congress Have Obamacare?

It\u2019s utterly absurd that Congress was allowed to claim to be a small business just to keep the taxpayer-funded Obamacare exemption, but is now telling the IRS that it\u2019s a large employer,\u201d Vitter said in a statement. \u201cOur ongoing mission is to maintain and uphold the government\u2019s credibility in the eyes of all Americans, and to make Washington live under Obamacare just like the rest of the country has been forced to accept.\u201d\n\nFollow Juliegrace Brufke on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
