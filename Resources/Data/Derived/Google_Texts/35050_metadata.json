His true sports passion, however, is the history of the various games, exhibited by his in-depth book reviews and hobby of collecting cards and other sports memorabilia.\n\nTopps winds up production of its flagship baseball product with its 2014 Update set, and it\u2019s a nice finish. Sharp photography, All-Star memories and traded players in new uniforms make for a satisfying product.\n\nSome of the photography really pops. Card No. 203, for example, shows Cole Figueroa being doused by a bucket of Gatorade. The stream of liquid is frozen perfectly in the horizontal shot.\n\nAs usual, there are 330 cards to the base set, along with short-printed variations. A hobby box contains 36 packs, with 10 cards to a pack. That\u2019s always good news for set builders.\n\nTopps is promising one autograph or relic card per hobby box.\n\nThe hobby box I opened had 306 base cards, or slightly fewer than 93 percent. That\u2019s a fantastic amount.\n\nAn additional card was a variation for the Indians\u2019 Jason Giambi. The regular card has Cleveland\u2019s designated hitter yelling and pumping his fist; the variation has him standing under the stands after taking some batting practice.\n\nIn addition to the base set, there were six red hot foil parallels, 17 golds, a black parallel of Drew Pomeranz numbered to 63 and a pink parallel of Justin Turner numbered to 50.\n\nHere\u2019s a quirk. How many packs have you ever opened that had two cards back-to-back with players with the first name \u201cCollin\u201d? One pack I opened had Collin Cowgill, followed by Collin McHugh. And, if you\u2019re into similar names, the next card after the two Collin cards was that of Tyler Colvin. Go figure.\n\nThere were two Topps 75th anniversary card buybacks in the hobby box I sampled. The first was a 1978 card of Twins catcher Terry Bulling. The second one was much more exciting: a 1974 card of Pirates pitcher Steve Blass.\n\nThe hot card in the box was an All-Star Stitches event-worn workout jersey of the Mariners\u2019 Robinson Cano. It was a dark, generous swatch of material.\n\nInserts in the Update series are a combination of new cards and the continuation of subsets begun in Series 1 and 2.\n\nThere were four World Series Heroes inserts, including David Ortiz, John Lackey, David Freese and Rickey Henderson. Each card commemorates a famous feat by each player depicted.\n\nPower Players is a 25-card insert set, and they fall one in every six packs. The box I opened hit the average, as there were six.\n\nFond Farewells is a 15-card insert set that documents the swan songs of notable players. There were five in the box that I opened.\n\nThe Future Is Now subset continues into the Updates set, with 30 more cards that fall one in every four packs. This box hit the average again with nine cards; the 30 cards are broken into 10 individual players, who have three cards apiece.\n\nLike Series 1 and 2, die-cut cards in the 1989 Topps design return. There are 50 of these cards in the Update set; I pulled five from the hobby box I opened.\n\nOnce again, the Update set brings a nice conclusion to the baseball season for set builders and devotees of Topps\u2019 flagship product. Like spring training, the countdown begins for next year\u2019s sets.", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sun, 26 Oct 2014 16:13:04 -0400", "Description": "Topps winds up production of its flagship baseball product with its 2014 Update set, and it\u2019s a nice finish.
