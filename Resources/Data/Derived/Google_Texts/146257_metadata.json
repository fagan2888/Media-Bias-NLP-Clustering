Now it\u2019s everywhere.\n\nCalifornia has strong employer laws to accommodate breast-feeding mothers, but high schools are different.\n\n\u201cOh Gracie!\u201d says Acker. \u201cLet me see. Give it to mommy. Go wash your hands.\u201d She then laughs the laugh of a mother who has had many a day like this.\n\nParenting is hard, Acker says. Being a teen parent is even harder. Acker was barely 15 when she had Gracie.\n\nEven though she was a young mother, she\u2019d heard about the benefits of breast-feeding and decided she would try to breast-feed while attending her local high school in the Central Valley town of Reedley.\n\n\u201cThe people that can, should breast-feed,\u201d she says. \u201cChildren need the extra vitamins and antibodies that breast milk has.\u201d\n\nPressure to Skip Breast-feeding from Administrators, Friends\n\nBut she ran into some obstacles. For one, it was hard to find a private place where she could breast-feed or pump. When she told administrators she would likely need to pump every two hours, they gave her a list of all the possible cons: she would miss out on too much class time; she might lose credits; her grades might be affected.\n\nEven the other young mothers thought she was odd for wanting to breast-feed. There was a lot of pressure to be more carefree.\n\n\u201cThey were like, \u2018Girl, why aren\u2019t you out eating your lunch?\u2019\u201d Acker says.\n\nShe says she was encouraged to go a continuation school \u2014 an alternative program that\u2019s typically for at-risk kids. She finally agreed because it would be easier to breast-feed there. But it came with a cost. Acker says the school wasn\u2019t challenging.\n\nGenevieve Colvin of Breastfeed LA says Acker\u2019s story is pretty common. She says while many teenage moms don\u2019t choose to breast-feed, those who do cite barriers at school.\n\n\u201cThey are worried about completing their assignments and not having appropriate accommodations,\u201d she said.\n\nIn fact, Colvin says only 18 percent of LA County\u2019s school districts have policies for lactation accommodations and that lack of consistency is statewide. She says outside agencies like Women, Infants and Children (WIC) advocate for lactating students by making sure they have a safe private place to breast-feed, but systemically, school districts don\u2019t take an active role in implementing policy.\n\nColvin says that\u2019s a problem because teen moms are already at a disadvantage. It\u2019s important, she says, that when a woman is pregnant during her high school years, she has every opportunity to improve the life of her child and that includes being encouraged to breast-feed.\n\nCalifornia has some of the strongest laws in the country to support working mothers who breast-feed, she ways, but high schools are different.\n\n\u201cWe have very little substantive language in our education code that actually provides students with the same accommodations,\u201d she says.\n\nNew Bill Addresses Accommodations for Breast-feeding\n\nAssemblywoman Cristina Garcia (D-Bell Gardens) wants to strengthen that language. She recently sponsored Assembly Bill 302. She says the bill is simple and to the point.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t say you must have a lactation room or a pumping room. It says if you have a student that needs to lactate, you will create accommodations for them,\u201d Garcia says.\n\nIt\u2019s one more way to encourage young mothers to breast-feed while keeping them in a regular high school setting, she believes.\n\n\u201cA student at a traditional high school is going to have more opportunities and more options than a student at a continuation school,\u201d Garcia says. Teen parents are already at a disadvantage, \u201cI want to make sure that \u2026 we don\u2019t add to the layer of disadvantages that are there.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a policy Norma Acker wishes were in place when she went to high school. She\u2019s proud to say she breast-fed her daughter for eight months, and she would have done so no matter what the cost.\n\n\u201cIf it meant me dropping out of high school just to make her well, then I would do that,\u201d she says. \u201cIf it meant that I would fail as a person myself but be the best mom I could be for her, I would do that.\u201d\n\nBut Acker didn\u2019t fail. She\u2019s now in her second year of community college, and she\u2019s still making sure her daughter eats well.", "article_metadata": {"description": "California has strong laws to support working mothers who breast-feed, but high schools are different.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"For Breast-feeding Teen Moms, High Schools Don't Make the Grade\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2015\\/03\\/06\\/for-breast-feeding-teen-moms-high-schools-dont-make-the-grade\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-03-06 12:42:49\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-03-10 10:15:53\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":24371,\"author_id\":\"8344\",\"author_name\":\"State of Health\",\"author_display_name\":\"State of Health\",\"tags\":[],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\",\"Policy\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2015\\/03\\/RS14473_photo-e1425671532570.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "California has strong laws to support working mothers who breast-feed, but high schools are different.", "title": "For Breast-feeding Teen Moms, High Schools Don\u2019t Make the Grade", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2015/03/06/for-breast-feeding-teen-moms-high-schools-dont-make-the-grade/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2015/03/RS14473_photo-640x480.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIf it meant me dropping out of high school just to make her well, then I would do that,\u201d she says.\nIt\u2019s one more way to encourage young mothers to breast-feed while keeping them in a regular high school setting, she believes.\nCalifornia has strong employer laws to accommodate breast-feeding mothers, but high schools are different.\n\u201cA student at a traditional high school is going to have more opportunities and more options than a student at a continuation school,\u201d Garcia says.\nCalifornia has some of the strongest laws in the country to support working mothers who breast-feed, she ways, but high schools are different."}
