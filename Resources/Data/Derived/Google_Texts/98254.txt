Reuters Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers

Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers used the Republican response to Barack Obama’s State of the Union to unleash the party’s latest attack on the president’s health-care law, signaling her party will use it to bludgeon Democrats this election year.

“No, we shouldn’t go back to the way things were,” McMorris Rodgers said. “But this law is not working.”

“Republicans believe health-care choices should be yours, not the government’s,” she said.

On Wednesday, Republicans are scheduled to begin a three-day policy retreat, where health-care alternatives will be on the agenda.

Rebutting Obama’s speech, McMorris Rodgers said the real gap Americans face is “opportunity equality,” versus the income inequality the president underscored.

Republicans are stepping up their efforts to repeal and replace Obama’s health-care law. This week, a trio of Republican senators offered their own alternative to the Affordable Care Act. It remains to be seen whether the House will embrace the legislation.
