DOUALA, Cameroon (AP) — Cameroon’s army says it has broken up a Boko Haram training camp on its territory.

A statement issued Sunday said the camp, located in the Mayo-Danay district in the country’s Far North region, was dismantled Saturday.

Lt. Col. Didier Badjeck, spokesman for Cameroon’s army, said he was traveling to the region and could not provide details until he assessed the situation himself.

The Nigeria-based insurgents have expanded their operations in Cameroon in recent months, launching cross-border attacks as the government has become increasingly involved in regional efforts to contain them.

Jean-Pierre Mbida, a soldier with the Rapid Intervention Battalion tasked fighting Boko Haram, said the area where the camp was discovered had been “relatively calm.”

He said soldiers would search the area for other hideouts and training camps.
