Roberts Jr.\u2019s opinion in last week\u2019s case, Riley v. California, didn\u2019t deal with the NSA. But it was the way he approached the issue of smartphones \u2014 declining to apply 20th century precedents to new technology, and instead going back to the founders\u2019 first principles \u2014 that is likely to spur the shake-up.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s language in the opinion that suggests the court is going to be receptive to pro-privacy arguments we\u2019re going to raise,\u201d said Hanni Fakhoury, staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which has brought some of the lawsuits that are pushing a rethink of understanding of privacy.\n\nThe Riley case, with its companion case, U.S. v. Wurie, follows a 2012 ruling in U.S. v. Jones, wherein the court held that police trespassed when they went on someone\u2019s property to install a GPS tracker on a suspect\u2019s car and kept it there longer than their warrant allowed.\n\n\u201cThere have now been three cases in the last couple years raising significant Fourth Amendment issues in the new digital age, and the government has now lost all three of them unanimously,\u201d said Nathan Freed Wessler, staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union. \u201cI think it\u2019s a strong signal that the court is paying close attention to the need to develop 21st century rules for 21st century searches.\u201d\n\nIn the cellphone cases, the government had argued that a cellphone was like a piece of paper or anything else police find when they ask someone to turn out his pockets. Under previous precedent, police were allowed to use information gleaned from that kind of search.\n\nBut Chief Justice Roberts said browsing through a cellphone went beyond just looking at a piece of paper.\n\nIn a ruling that went into details such as gigabytes of storage space and \u201capps,\u201d or applications, the court said the intimate details of someone\u2019s life can now be stored in a pocket \u2014 information that clearly fell within the protections the founders envisioned for the Constitution.\n\n\u201cFor one of the very first times, the court is thinking like a regular person. It\u2019s talking about apps; it\u2019s talking about [how] you carry 1,000 pictures. It\u2019s talking about [the] real world,\u201d Mr. Fakhoury of EFF said.\n\nNow lawyers are asking what else that kind of reasoning can be extended to.\n\nCourts are already grappling with searches at the border, where authorities have confiscated laptops and perused their contents. And federal appeals courts have issued split rulings on whether police need a warrant to ask a cell company for the information tracking where someone\u2019s phone has been \u2014 a way of potentially linking someone, by geography, to where a crime was committed.\n\nThe big question in legal circles is what happens with a 1979 case, Smith v. Maryland, which held that installing a pen register to track telephone numbers someone calls is not a search, so the government doesn\u2019t need to get a warrant to get that information.\n\nIn that decision, the court reasoned that the consumer was voluntarily turning the information over to the telephone company and so didn\u2019t have a legitimate expectation of privacy.\n\nHotly debated since, the Smith ruling has come under particular scrutiny in recent months with the revelation that the government was tracking the time, duration and numbers involved in most calls made in the U.S.\n\nThat bulk collection, revealed by former government contractor Edward Snowden\u2019s leaks, has raised questions about whether the exponential explosion of data \u2014 and the power to collect it \u2014 has made some of those 20th century decisions irrelevant.\n\nIn the 2012 Jones decision, wherein the Supreme Court ruled the government couldn\u2019t place a GPS tracking device on a car without a warrant, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote a concurring opinion saying the court may need to revisit what\u2019s become known as the third-party doctrine.\n\nMr. Fakhoury at the EFF said it\u2019s also possible the court could keep the Smith ruling intact but find that bulk data gathering, such as the NSA\u2019s phone snooping program, is different.\n\n\u201cSmith v. Maryland is about one guy\u2019s phone calls over three days. NSA\u2019s phone collection is about five years of every single American\u2019s phone calls. There\u2019s a world of difference between the two,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Stewart A. Baker, former assistant secretary for policy at the Department of Homeland Security, said legal thinkers should be wary of sidelining the Smith case, saying the logic behind it still rings true today.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s actually very hard to rethink that in a way that withstands the test of time and analysis and the press of litigation,\u201d he said. \u201cI think once it comes to the Supreme Court, they\u2019re going to realize that. They don\u2019t like to write a rule that will require 20 more cases to decide what it actually means.\u201d\n\nWriting a new rule from the high court could also end up missing key developments in how Americans view technology, said Mr. Baker, who is now a lawyer at Steptoe & Johnson law firm.\n\nHe pointed back to the beginnings of current privacy jurisprudence, which began in the late 1900s when future Justice Louis Brandeis laid out the case, protesting against the encroachment of technology. His target at the time was the portable Kodak camera and its potential use by the press. Today, the camera is a given in Americans\u2019 lives.\n\nHe said the problem is that by the time the privacy rules are written to accommodate new technology, Americans\u2019 sensibilities and acceptance level have changed.\n\n\u201cWe should wise up and stop saying, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m uncomfortable with this; we need privacy rules that stop me from being uncomfortable,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nThe Smith decision has long tentacles.\n\nMr. Wessler pointed to a medical records statute in Oregon, which is one of many states that have created prescription drug databases so doctors can look up patients\u2019 records and try to stop doctor shopping or individuals who are trying to obtain multiple prescriptions.\n\nIn Oregon, the statute requires a warrant for police to get a look at the data. But federal drug authorities demanded the data without a warrant, arguing that the state\u2019s prohibition didn\u2019t apply to them since, like the Smith decision, patients voluntarily engage in the commerce that causes their prescription data to appear.\n\nBut Mr. Wessler said if that stands, it means the government could gain access to the most intimate of information without needed a warrant.\n\n\u201cTo us that\u2019s just a galling assertion and a complete misunderstanding of people\u2019s expectations of privacy,\u201d Mr. Wessler said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rulings on contraception and recess appointments may have grabbed bigger headlines, but the Supreme Court's decision last month requiring police to get a warrant before snooping through someone's cellphone is likely to have a bigger lasting impact.", "Author": "Stephen Dinan", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Rulings on contraception and recess appointments may have grabbed bigger headlines, but the Supreme Court\u2019s decision last month requiring police to get a warrant before snooping through someone\u2019s cellphone is likely to have a bigger lasting impact.", "title": "Phone snoop ruling sets precedent on technology", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jul/6/phone-snoop-ruling-sets-precedent-on-technology/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/07/06/7_6_2014_ap4383124027818201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/07/06/7_6_2014_ap4383124027818201.jpg", "title": "Phone snoop ruling sets precedent on technology", "description": "Rulings on contraception and recess appointments may have grabbed bigger headlines, but the Supreme Court's decision last month requiring police to get a warrant before snooping through someone's cell", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Law Crime, Supreme Court, Nathan Freed Wessler, Hanni Fakhoury, Electronic Frontier Foundation"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2e24\"", "article_summary": "\u201cSmith v.
