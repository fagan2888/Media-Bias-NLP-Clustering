Stephens said the evaluation revealed overstaffing in some departments and understaffing in others.\n\nA total of eight positions in five different departments were cut, including the laboratory, the dietary department, rehab services, the cardiopulmonary department and materials management. Another employee had their hours reduced from full time to part time. Officials declined to say how much money the layoffs would save the hospital.\n\nAbout 232 people currently work at the hospital.\n\nIn the press release, Whitfield said the hospital had made many efforts to reduce costs in recent months but that even after that the administration felt the layoffs were necessary \u201cto ensure the medical center\u2019s financial security.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are very much a family at Cabinet Peaks Medical Center, and our associates are incredibly valuable to our organization. This difficult decision was not reached easily and comes only after careful consideration and thorough analysis,\u201d Whitfield said. \u201cWhile these decisions and times are difficult, the change is necessary for Cabinet Peaks Medical Center to continue to provide quality, compassionate care to the communities that we serve. We will continue to provide excellent patient care and remain focused on improving the patient experience.\u201d\n\nThe mood of this week\u2019s announcement was markedly different from just a few months ago when officials celebrated the completion of the new $34 million facility. Construction on the 77,000-square-foot facility began in 2012 and was aided in part by a loan from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. The new hospital replaced a smaller one built in 1952.\n\nThe announcement that eight people had been laid off deals another blow to Lincoln County\u2019s already fragile economy. In July, the county\u2019s unemployment rate of 10.5 percent was more than twice the state\u2019s 4.4 percent. Earlier this year, Lincoln County\u2019s unemployment rate hit 18 percent, the highest it had been three years. The area\u2019s economy has been struggling for more than two decades as the mining and forestry industries experience sharp declines in that area.\n\nHospital officials insisted that the decision to layoff people was not taken lightly, however they remained hopeful for the future.\n\n\u201cOur patients are why we go to work every day and we\u2019re still going to offer them the best healthcare we can,\u201d Stephens said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Flathead Beacon", "description": "Cabinet Peaks Medical Center in Libby laid off eight people on Aug. 22 in what the hospital called a \u201ctargeted reduction in workforce.\u201d The layoffs come just months after Cabinet...  more", "title": "Layoffs Hit Cabinet Peaks Medical Center in Libby - Flathead Beacon", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://flatheadbeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/CabinetPeaks2.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-08-25T11:52:11-06:00", "url": "http://flatheadbeacon.com/2014/08/25/layoffs-hit-cabinet-peaks-medical-center-libby/", "type": "article"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f01d4f", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://flatheadbeacon.com/wp-content/themes/flathead-beacon/library/images/win8-tile-icon.png", "google-site-verification": "x7bqQRTLUVbNNQe0HUJ0bnx_EXmr6uOwcIs_ZIT9n9g", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/FlatheadBeacon", "section": "Front Page", "published_time": "2014-08-25T11:22:53-06:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-25T11:52:11-06:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde555\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWhile these decisions and times are difficult, the change is necessary for Cabinet Peaks Medical Center to continue to provide quality, compassionate care to the communities that we serve.\nCabinet Peaks Medical Center in Libby laid off eight people on Aug. 22 in what the hospital called a \u201ctargeted reduction in workforce.\u201d The layoffs come just months after Cabinet Peaks opened a new $34 million facility that replaced the smaller St. John\u2019s Lutheran Hospital.\nHospital officials said the layoffs were made because of the economic pressures facing the medical industry and Lincoln County.\nHospital officials insisted that the decision to layoff people was not taken lightly, however they remained hopeful for the future.\n\u201cCabinet Peaks Medical Center is not immune to those economic pressures.\u201dAccording to spokesperson Kate Stephens, an outside company came to the hospital in April to evaluate the facility\u2019s productivity compared to other hospitals of its size."}
