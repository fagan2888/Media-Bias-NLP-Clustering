Donegan was commissioner for Vermont\u2019s Division of Insurance in 2013 when she refused to issue a license to the proposed Vermont Health CO-OP, saying it failed to meet state standards. Her action barred the Obamacare non-profit from selling health insurance in the state.\n\nShe quickly came under fire in Sen. Bernie Sander\u2019s deep-blue home state, where co-ops are immensely popular. Today, she looks like a prescient state official who likely saved thousands of Vermonters from buying their health insurance from a doomed insurer.\n\nThat\u2019s because 13 of the 24 co-ops set up under Obamacare have collapsed, costing the federal treasury $1.3 billion. More than 800,000 co-op customers now find themselves without health insurance coverage and are scrambling to find new policies due to the co-op failures.\n\nTurns out that some of the biggest problems she identified two years ago in her state also doomed co-ops across the country. In an exclusive interview, Donegan talked with the Daily Caller News Foundation for nearly an hour to recount her decision, its aftermath and the lessons she learned about the federal co-op program.\n\nDenying a license to the health co-op was not an easy decision for Donegan, who first joined Democratic Gov. Peter Shumlin\u2019s administration as a deputy insurance commissioner in 2010.\n\nFirst, she already knew when the co-op\u2019s application arrived at her her office that federal officials in Washington, D.C., had pre-approved the co-op\u2019s plan and allocated to it $33 million in taxpayer funds.\n\nSecond, she knew the co-ops were an important part of President Obama\u2019s signature health reform effort. Obama is extremely popular in Vermont, having garnered 67 percent of the vote in his 2008 and 2012 campaigns.\n\nThe small New England state also is the land of co-ops. Doug Dimento, a spokesman for Cabot Farmers Co-operative Creamery, which started in 1919, says co-ops in Vermont represent a way of life. His co-operative has 1,200 dairy farmer members and enjoyed $1.1 billion in revenue last year.\n\n\u201cWe have maple sugar marketing co-ops,\u201d he told TheDCNF. \u201cThere\u2019s dairy co-ops, there\u2019s beef co-ops, there\u2019s grain co-ops, there\u2019s apple co-ops, there\u2019s consumer\u2019s co-ops. There\u2019s well over 100 co-ops.\u201d\n\nDonegan sensed trouble as soon as she read the co-op\u2019s application. There were optimistic and questionable forecasts, a board filled with friends, sweetheart deals, high salaries, deep conflicts of interest and a staff with little business expertise.\n\nShe believed the Obamacare co-op model \u2014 as presented by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services officials in Washington, D.C. \u2014 was deeply flawed for Vermont.\n\n\u201cThe model was not sustainable,\u201d she said. And referring to the 13 co-op\u2019s that have failed: \u201cI think perhaps, my thoughts back then may have borne themselves out in some way.\u201d\n\nDonegan said she and her staff \u201creally had to scrub numbers many times, work with actuaries, make sure what we were seeing was going to be a company to be able to sustain itself. And every time we kept doing that, we just kept coming up short, saying \u2018you know there are a lot of things that aren\u2019t just working.\u2019 It really gave us pause. The numbers weren\u2019t there.\u201d\n\nAmong the first deficiencies Donegan discovered was that as a federally designed model, the co-op immediately would be burdened with $33 million liability in federal loans despite having no cash flow, no customers and no tangible assets.\n\nSolid capitalization is essential in the insurance business where money is its lifeblood. However, when the federal co-ops were established, CMS instructed state regulators to treat the liabilities as \u201cassets,\u201d which didn\u2019t sit well with Donegan.\n\n\u201cThis is basically going to be funded with a loan from the federal government. When you have a loan, that means you have to pay it back at some point. It was going to be a burden to pay that back. So what happens when you have a debt that can\u2019t be met,\u201d she said. \u201cWe realized that there was going already to be a burden financially on the company from Day One.\u201d\n\nHer small army of insurance experts, actuaries, accountants and forensic economists also had other questions, including its optimistic membership forecast of 19,000. Then there was the lack of staff with experience in either business or insurance, a common flaw among the Obamacare co-ops.\n\n\u201cThis was a highly risky operation to begin with,\u201d Donegan told TheDCNF. \u201cBut when we looked at the Vermont proposed board itself, we wanted to make sure we had folks who had business experience, understood a balance sheet, who had the kind of judgment that you would want in a board and who would act independently over the management. And we just didn\u2019t see that.\u201d\n\nShe also discovered that like many other of the federally established health co-ops, it was wracked with poor governance. The board was filled with conflicts of interest and insiders who would be in positions to exploit the company for personal gain.\n\n\u201cIt was a board, as you see in our order, that was put together as friends of friends. You can\u2019t have a board like that. You have to have folks who understand what governance was about and are willing to take the risks and responsibilities of that position,\u201d she said.\n\nAnother of the early problems Donegan discovered was the co-op\u2019s newly installed president, Mitchell Fleischer, owned Fleischer-Jacob, an insurance brokerage firm that got a sweetheart contract worth from $500,000 $2 million. He also paid himself $120,000 a year in a salary, while other commercial insurance company leaders were paid as little as $28,000.\n\n\u201cI had corporate governance issues,\u201d she said. \u201cThat quickly pushed it over the edge for me. I had conflicts of interest. I had board members that were clueless. That added to a very quick decision.\u201d\n\nIn its 37-page decision, Donegan\u2019s Department of Financial Regulation determined in May 2013 that the co-op would suffer cumulative losses of $9 million in the first three years of operation, if it achieved 50 percent of its target enrollment.\n\nShe told the public that insolvency put Vermonters at risk. \u201cIf solvency is in jeopardy, you\u2019re not protecting consumers,\u201d she said the day her department announced its refusal to license the co-op.\n\nNevertheless, the co-op and its supporters fought back. Christine Oliver, the co-op\u2019s CEO and a former Shumlin appointee, said she was \u201cblindsided.\u201d\n\nOne account reported that Oliver \u201chas continued to make her way across the Vermont media landscape, blasting back at Donegan\u2019s decision. Oliver and co-op founder Mitchell Fleischer even tried to bring Democratic Gov. Peter Shumlin into the fray.\u201d\n\nDonegan said she was vigorously attacked, recalling that \u201cthe co-op itself was very vocal with the press, wanting to know why we were not just happily cutting a license. There were folks who were not happy with me. I did get some emails that were sort of little angry emails.\u201d\n\nShe was particularly vulnerable because of the state\u2019s favorable history with co-operatives.\n\n\u201cThe word co-op is a very emotional word in a lot of places, especially in Vermont,\u201d Donegan said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a history of co-ops for decades. We have food co-ops, farmer co-ops. I remember one email in particular that said, \u2018Commissioner, please, please let this company be licensed. I buy my food and eggs at a co-op. I want to buy my insurance at a co-op.\u201d\n\nDonegan says she was sympathetic. \u201cI understood that point of view. But I don\u2019t think that person would have wanted to buy insurance from a company that was not going to make it more than a year or two. Then they would have been in a different situation.\u201d\n\nAs it turned out Shumlin supported her. \u201cHe understood my recommendation and my final decision that we were not going to license the company. And he was absolutely supportive,\u201d she said.\n\nSchumlin promoted her in 2013 to serve as his commissioner for his newly reorganized Department of Financial Regulation, which oversees all financial businesses in the state.\n\n\u201cThe worst thing that I could have done was to license an entity that arguably would have been pretty close to being in financially hazardous condition,\u201d she told TheDCNF. \u201cTo do that almost upon granting a license seemed wrong.\u201d\n\nDonegan said the current string of co-op closings and the loss of insurance coverage for hundreds of thousands is \u201cstaggering.\u201d\n\nLooking back at the controversy, she said she would refuse to license the co-op again if presented with the same kind of weaknesses. \u201cI would rather than turn down a company that\u2019s not quite up to snuff than to put any policyholders in jeopardy,\u201d she said.\n\nDonegan said she also understood that there were creditors who did not get paid when the co-op closed down.\n\nDr. Mandy Cohen, chief of staff at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services that manages the federal co-op program testified before the House Energy and Commerce Committee on Nov. 5 that the U.S. Government did lose funds on the Vermont co-op. \u201cThere was some funding that was used in their startup funds that was not recovered,\u201d she said.\n\nFollow Richard on Twitter\n\nClick here for reuse options!
