Fiorina received her health coverage through her husband\u2019s AT&T retirement plan, but for everyone else she advocated allowing insurance companies to sell policies across state lines, which would be a boon to the insurers and a disaster for buyers.\n\nWhen called out on the paragraph by a reader on Twitter, Hiltzik defended what he wrote:\n\nYou should take that up with #Carly: she deliberately exploited her own illness for her political campaign https://t.co/8qvNhmRlCj \u2014 Michael Hiltzik (@hiltzikm) August 12, 2015\n\nYou're saying she should be able to use her own cancer case as a weapon against working women, without pushback https://t.co/Up2zOb3VUD \u2014 Michael Hiltzik (@hiltzikm) August 12, 2015\n\nShe raised the point, without prompting, at her campaign launch event on Day One. https://t.co/Up2zOb3VUD \u2014 Michael Hiltzik (@hiltzikm) August 12, 2015\n\nIn her world, you wouldn't be entitled to affordable treatment https://t.co/nXpySTKlxG \u2014 Michael Hiltzik (@hiltzikm) August 12, 2015\n\nThe Federalist\u2019s Sean Davis also points out that Hiltzik has a long history of unscrupulous behavior, including attacking his opponents with sockpuppet accounts and hacking into his L.A.
