Michelle J. Howard made history Tuesday when she received her fourth star, making her the first woman in the Navy to be promoted to the rank, according to The Navy Times.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t believe today was a first, when I called to order four-star shoulder boards for women, they didn\u2019t [even] exist,\u201d Adm. Howard said during Tuesday\u2019s ceremony, The Navy Times reported. \u201cA special contract was let, and you folks are seeing the first set in the history of the United States Navy.\u201d\n\nHer promotion to four-star admiral was not the first time Adm. Howard made history. She graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1982 and then went on to become the first black woman to command a Naval ship \u2014 the USS Rushmore.\n\nAdm. Howard\u2019s promotion took place at the Women in Military Service for America Memorial at Arlington National Cemetery and was presided over by Navy Secretary Ray Mabus, who said that Adm. Howard serves as a role model for his own three daughters.\n\n\u201cShe is\u2026a great example of how much we as a nation and [as] a Navy lose if we put artificial barriers in,\u201d Mr. Mabus said at the ceremony, according to The Washington Post. \u201cIf we don\u2019t judge people based on their ability\u2026on their capability.\u201d\n\nSome critics have claimed that Adm. Howard was promoted for political reasons, rather than merit, though Mr. Mabus and Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Jonathan Greenert, who also presided over her promotion, both rebutted those claims, according to The Navy Times.\n\n\u201cThe Navy chose the best officer to be the VCNO \u2014 that\u2019s the only thing that happened here today,\u201d Mr. Mabus said.\n\nAdm. Greenert called her career \u201ctremendous.\u201d\n\n\u201cThirty-two years of mainstream, at-sea \u2014 tough tours. Michelle came up through the amphibious expeditionary warfare arena and came into [Washington] and did the hard jobs that needed to be done. And so she is definitely ready to assume this position, there is no question in my mind,\u201d Adm. Greenert said in The Navy Times.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Michelle J Howard, Navy, Ray Mabus", "Author": "Jennifer Pompi", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jul/1/michelle-j-howard-becomes-navys-first-female-4-sta/", "type": "article", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/07/01/first-woman-admiraljpeg-0b2c7.jpg", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "title": "Michelle J.
