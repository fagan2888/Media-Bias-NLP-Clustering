However, in patients who received the immunotherapy, half lived nearly five years or longer from their diagnosis,\u201d said Dr. John Sampson of Duke University Medical Center, who oversaw the study.\n\nThe team has been using what is known as immunotherapy to fight glioblastoma. They remove some of the patient\u2019s own immune cells, train them to recognize the tumor, and then re-inject them. It\u2019s a hit-and-miss approach being used against a range of cancers.\n\nWith glioblastoma\u2019s there\u2019s a trick \u2014 the tumors collect large amounts of a virus called cytomegalovirus or CMV that infects many people, usually without causing symptoms.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear if CMV actually causes the cancer, but an anti-tumor vaccine that targets CMV sends immune cells right to the brain tumor. This treatment alone has helped patients live longer \u2014 from an average of 12 to 14 months for patients who get chemotherapy alone, to more than 18 months with the immunotherapy.\n\nThat\u2019s not long enough, though, and the team was looking for ways to activate even more tumor-killing cells. They decided to try tetanus, which is a vaccine that most Americans have received, safely, and one that activates a strong immune response.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the same tetanus booster you get when you step on a rusty nail and have to go into the ER and get a shot,\u201d said Dr. Kristen Batich of Duke University, who helped lead the study published in the journal Nature.\n\n\u201cSo we enrolled 12 patients that we treated who underwent their standard care chemotherapy and radiation, which was done after their surgery, and then from there on they received our immunotherapy vaccine,\u201d she told NBC News.\n\nThe effects were remarkable. Patients who got the tetanus booster lived more than two years on average \u2014 about 26 months.\n\nRead more at NBC News", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Researchers who have harnessed the body's immune system to fight cancer have found a way to make the approach work even better.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/tetanus-vaccine-boosts-cancer-therapy", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "Researchers who have harnessed the body's immune system to fight cancer have found a way to make the approach work even better.", "title": "Tetanus vaccine boosts cancer therapy", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/tetanus-vaccine-boosts-cancer-therapy", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/articles/gs3317125.jpg?itok=Dc4Gp1aT", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "title": "Tetanus vaccine boosts cancer therapy", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/tetanus-vaccine-boosts-cancer-therapy", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/articles/gs3317125.jpg?itok=vofjvUb9", "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Researchers who have harnessed the body's immune system to fight cancer have found a way to make the approach work even better."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2015-03-11T14:29:51-04:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "article": {"author": "http://www.facebook.com/msnbc"}, "abstract": "Researchers who have harnessed the body's immune system to fight cancer have found a way to make the approach work even better.", "nv": {"date": "03/11/2015 14:29:51 EDT", "title": "Tetanus vaccine boosts cancer therapy", "published": 1, "tags": "health", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/tetanus-vaccine-boosts-cancer-therapy"}, "news_keywords": "Health"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf003\"", "article_summary": "Researchers who have harnessed the body\u2019s immune system to fight cancer have found a way to make the approach work even better, using an ordinary tetanus vaccine.\nIt\u2019s not clear if CMV actually causes the cancer, but an anti-tumor vaccine that targets CMV sends immune cells right to the brain tumor.\nThey decided to try tetanus, which is a vaccine that most Americans have received, safely, and one that activates a strong immune response.\nThey remove some of the patient\u2019s own immune cells, train them to recognize the tumor, and then re-inject them.\nThey used their double-vaccine approach to greatly lengthen the lives of patients with one of the deadliest types of cancer \u2014 the brain tumor glioblastoma."}
