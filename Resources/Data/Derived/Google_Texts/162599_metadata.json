What we have to concentrate on is having great possessions on offense. We can\u2019t have empty possessions. We can\u2019t take bad shots.\n\n\u201cThat shouldn\u2019t be any different (than when Dinwiddie was in the lineup),\u201d Boyle added. \u201cBut with him being out, the offensive possessions become that much more valuable. We have to make sure we take care of the ball and get a great shot every time.\u201d\n\nTipoff is 6 p.m. The Pac-12 Network has the telecast.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Associated Press,Boulder,Buffaloes,Coach Tad Boyle,College Basketball,Colorado,Coors Events Center,CU,CU Buffs,injury,NCAA,Oregon,Pac-12,Running,SEC,Spencer Dinwiddie,Surgery,Tad Boyle,Tre'Shaun Fletcher,UCLA", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "The Field House", "description": "Colorado coach Tad Boyle said his team's margin for error has been narrowed with point guard Spencer Dinwiddie out, but the Buffs will still do what they do.", "title": "Tad Boyle: CU Buffs not changing approach with Spencer Dinwiddie out", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/colleges/2014/01/16/colorados-tad-boyle-were-not-changing-our-approach-with-dinwiddie-out/29767/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/colleges/files/2014/01/spencer-dinwiddie-cu-buffs.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Colorado coach Tad Boyle said his team's margin for error has been narrowed with point guard Spencer Dinwiddie out, but the Buffs will still do what they do.", "title": "With Spencer Dinwiddie out, Tad Boyle says CU Buffs not changing approach", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/colleges/2014/01/16/colorados-tad-boyle-were-not-changing-our-approach-with-dinwiddie-out/29767/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/colleges/files/2014/01/spencer-dinwiddie-cu-buffs.jpg", "creator": "@tomkensler", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Colorado coach Tad Boyle said his team's margin for error has been narrowed with point guard Spencer Dinwiddie out, but the Buffs will still do what they do"}, "article_summary": "25 UCLA (13-3, 2-1 Pac-12) at the Coors Events Center, Colorado men\u2019s basketball coach Tad Boyle could take comfort in knowing the No.\nWhat we have to concentrate on is having great possessions on offense.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t change anything in terms of our approach \u2014 attacking the basket, getting to the free-throw line, playing inside-out,\u201d Boyle said.\n\u201cI think now, our margin for error (without Dinwiddie running the offense) is much less.\n21 Buffaloes (14-3, 3-1) did not have to make wholesale changes to their system during the past several days."}
