Her spontaneous answer, of course, was \u201cjust say no.\u201d\n\nThis simple phrase became a mantra which endured, in various forms, for decades.\n\nPerhaps the phrase had its most significant impact on school-based drug education programs, which proliferated in the early 1980s alongside the escalating War on Drugs. \u201cJust Say No\u201d became its fundamental principle.\n\nI have to admit that in 1982, when my daughter was young and I was studying heroin addiction for the National Institute on Drug Abuse, I thought Reagan\u2019s advice was just fine. Who wouldn\u2019t want kids to abstain, anyway?\n\nSubsequently, \u201cjust say no\u201d became institutionalized, with the ubiquitous D.A.R.E. (Drug Abuse Resistance Education), created by the Los Angeles Police Department in 1983, making its way into 75 percent of school districts in America.\n\nThe messages contained in prevention programs were designed to frighten adolescents. They included such statements as: \u201cdrugs are categorically dangerous,\u201d \u201call use constitutes abuse,\u201d \u201cmarijuana inevitably leads to \u2018hard\u2019 drug use, addiction, lung cancer,\u201d \u201cboys who smoke marijuana will grow breasts,\u201d to name a few. It didn\u2019t matter if the information presented was based on science or myth. The sole goal was abstinence, and any approaches that veered from this message were censored. Furthermore, if coaxing didn\u2019t work, the admonishments were backed up with \u201czero tolerance\u201d policies with severe consequences. We are living with these consequences today, having witnessed an escalation in arrests unparalleled in American history \u2014 not to mention the mass incarceration of a generation of young black men.\n\nThroughout the '80s and into the '90s, abstinence-only drug education programs, coupled with anti-drug campaigns that permeated the media, were the unquestioned norm in the United States. Yet by the mid-1990s, the results of survey data indicated that teen drug use had not declined. It was inching up. Indeed, many teens were not buying it, turning many of the messages into a joke.\n\nBy this time, my own children had entered adolescence. I wanted my children to abstain, but I had to be realistic. They, like other teens growing up in San Francisco, were going to be confronted with a range of psychoactive substances. They would need scientifically sound drug education that would enable them to make healthy decisions. In the end, their safety was my No. 1 priority.\n\nFortunately, at that time the concept of \u201charm reduction\u201d drug education was emerging, largely abroad. This novel approach advocated abstinence while acknowledging the need for scientifically-based, safety-oriented information and positive strategies for those teens who were saying \u201cmaybe\u201d or \u201csometimes\u201d or even \u201cyes.\n\nSo whatever happened to \u201cjust say no\u201d?\n\nWhile conventional drug education has been slow to change, today there is a growing movement of parents and educators who understand the limitations of simplistic, albeit well-meaning, slogans. Even the new D.A.R.E. (\"Keepin\u2019 it Real\") has dispensed with \u201cjust say no.\u201d\n\nThree decades after Nancy Reagan\u2019s famous advice, in schools and communities all over the country, parents and educators are embracing a new mantra. It\u2019s \u201cJust say know,\u201d and offers, in addition to stressing the value of abstinence, reality-based information that teens trust. With marijuana legalization looming in California, and along with it a cultural shift in perspective, this new approach has the greatest promise for keeping our teens savvy, safe and truly educated.\n\nMarsha Rosenbaum is the founder of the Safety First Project, a program of the Drug Policy Alliance.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://wrtnews.co/1pl2DOe", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The anti-drug message has to adapt to a different time.", "og": {"site_name": "Daily Tribune Media", "description": "The anti-drug message has to adapt to a different time.", "title": "From Nancy Reagan's 'just say no' to just say 'know'", "url": "http://www.wisconsinrapidstribune.com/story/opinion/columnists/2016/03/11/nancy-reagans-just-say-no-just-say-know/81644894/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/wisconsinrapidstribune.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The anti-drug message has to adapt to a different time.", "title": "From Nancy Reagan's 'just say no' to just say 'know'", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/540179cb60818cb8df42f651e518047e03326128/c=0-0-2178-2178&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/03/11/WIGroup/WisconsinRapids/635932956746242212-Nancy-Reagan-Just-Say-Roku.jpg", "creator": "@wrtribune", "site": "@wrtribune", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=885558265", "fb": {"app_id": 132335483492709}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "just say no, drugs, nancy reagan, DARE"}, "article_summary": "Perhaps the phrase had its most significant impact on school-based drug education programs, which proliferated in the early 1980s alongside the escalating War on Drugs.\n(\"Keepin\u2019 it Real\") has dispensed with \u201cjust say no.\u201dThree decades after Nancy Reagan\u2019s famous advice, in schools and communities all over the country, parents and educators are embracing a new mantra.\nIt\u2019s \u201cJust say know,\u201d and offers, in addition to stressing the value of abstinence, reality-based information that teens trust.\nThroughout the '80s and into the '90s, abstinence-only drug education programs, coupled with anti-drug campaigns that permeated the media, were the unquestioned norm in the United States.\nThey would need scientifically sound drug education that would enable them to make healthy decisions."}
