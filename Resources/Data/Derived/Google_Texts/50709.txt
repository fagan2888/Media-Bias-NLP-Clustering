About 367,000 Texans will lose their individual health insurance policies next year when BlueCross BlueShield of Texas stops offering its Blue Choice PPO (preferred provider organization) plans.

The Richardson-based insurer started notifying customers and agents of the change this week, noting that it paid out $400 million more in claims last year than it collected in premiums.

“Losses that high are unsustainable, and we have adjusted our offerings – as many insurers have – to be sustainable in the new market reality,” the company said in a letter to insurance agents.

The insurer said it would still offer an HMO (health maintenance organization) plan in every county in the state via the Affordable Care Act’s Healthcare.gov website. Fewer doctors are willing to accept HMO patients.

The change does not affect BlueCross Blue Shield of Texas PPO plans offered by employers. And about 148,000 individuals who started PPO plans before March 2010 will still have that option in 2016, the company said.
