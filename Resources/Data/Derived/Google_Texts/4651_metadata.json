The ACO, which includes about 5,000 quality physicians covering 60,000 Medicare patients, has already shown promising results, he said, with all quality measures above the 50th percentile.\n\nPart of the secret of the organization's success is its use of distinct measures for all of its goals, Cosgrove said, from emergency department wait times to employee weight loss under its wellness program. \"Physicians are an incredibly data-driven group,\" he said, \"and if you want to make a change, you present the data and that makes the case for you.\"\n\nFor example, Cleveland Clinic is committed to improving care access so that patients can see a provider \"anytime, anywhere\" whether in a hospital, ER or walk-in clinic. Using the \"split-flow\" model--a variation on triage in which nurses redirect patients to one of two areas depending on the severity of their conditions--the clinic's average ED wait times are down to 13 minutes, Cosgrove said. The clinic also makes same-day appointments for 98 percent of people who request one.\n\nCosgrove is also proud of the organization's Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) patient experience scores, which improved across all campuses, In five years, he said, the clinic went from last place to first in HCAHPS scores for hospitals with more than 1,000 beds.\n\nBut Cosgrove admits that the organization still has its challenges. For example, he said, lack of doctor communication remains the most common patient complaint, leading the clinic to implement mandatory communication courses.\n\nAnd, he lamented that he \"cannot believe I can't get everyone to wash their hands every time.\" To improve hand-hygiene compliance, he said, the organization has added electronic hand-washing alert systems at the door of each patient room. It also implemented the \"snap system,\" which encourages employees to snap their fingers to remind one another to wash their hands.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nCleveland Clinic sees steep drop in uncompensated care\n\nCleveland hospital dropped HAI rates with hand-washing campaign\n\nHow the Cleveland Clinic has embraced value-based care\n\nCosgrove: Patient experience key to healthcare quality\n\nElectronic monitoring helps nurses boost hand-washing compliance\n\nHow value-based care will change healthcare\n\nCleveland Clinic partnership aims to boost telemedicine services\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Despite its challenges with hand-hygiene compliance and doctor-patient communication, Cleveland Clinic has had tremendous success with accountable care and improving patient safety and care access, according to CEO\u00a0Toby Cosgrove, M.D., who spoke Friday at the sixth annual National ACO Summit in the District of Columbia.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Despite its challenges with hand-hygiene compliance and doctor-patient communication, Cleveland Clinic has had tremendous success with accountable care and improving patient safety and care access, according to CEO\u00a0Toby Cosgrove, M.D., who spoke Friday at the sixth annual National ACO Summit in the District of Columbia.", "title": "Toby Cosgrove reveals the secret to Cleveland Clinic's care delivery transformation", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/toby-cosgrove-reveals-secret-cleveland-clinics-care-delivery-transformation/2015-06-22", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "accountable care,Care Delivery,care integration,Cleveland Clinic,Communication Gaps,emergency department,green hospitals,Hand Hygiene,healthcare access,Hospital Consumer Assessment of Health Providers and Systems (HCAHPS),Infection Prevention,medical waste,National ACO Summit,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,Patient Engagement,Patient Experience,patient safety,patient satisfaction,Toby Cosgrove", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,Patient Engagement,Patient Satisfaction"}, "article_summary": "The clinic launched its accountable care organization this year, integrating primary and specialty care, which \"yields quality, safety and affordability,\" he said.\nFor example, Cleveland Clinic is committed to improving care access so that patients can see a provider \"anytime, anywhere\" whether in a hospital, ER or walk-in clinic.\nFor example, he said, lack of doctor communication remains the most common patient complaint, leading the clinic to implement mandatory communication courses.\nTo improve hand-hygiene compliance, he said, the organization has added electronic hand-washing alert systems at the door of each patient room.\nIt also implemented the \"snap system,\" which encourages employees to snap their fingers to remind one another to wash their hands."}
