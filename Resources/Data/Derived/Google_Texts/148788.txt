NBA players have a history of agreeing to some really bizarre photo shoots.

I would argue that Jason Kidd got things started with whatever he was doing here and here in 1992, and then here in 2000. But Kobe Bryant quickly surpassed him with this head-scratcher in 2010. And then, of course, there was Chris Paul on the trampoline in 2012, which was soon followed with this number by Dwyane Wade (why is she sitting on the hoop?). And we obviously can never forget the many athletic souls who opted to pose buck nekkid for ESPN’s The Body Issue (hi, Kenneth). Too much, guys. Too much.

(UPDATE: A smart reader pointed out that I had forgotten one NBA cover that … oy. Here, just look for yourself.)

But perhaps none are as odd as this one (OK maybe Kobe’s was … that was really odd actually): Say hello to “Basketball Timofey Mozgov,” in the latest issue of Russian Esquire. He’s wearing a lot of shirts. And no one knows why.

But wait, it gets better!

Guys, how many times are you going to repeat the same mistakes? Say no to weird to photo shoots. Why can’t you all just take a cue from Chuck and only do completely natural but nonetheless fantastic photo shoots like this?
