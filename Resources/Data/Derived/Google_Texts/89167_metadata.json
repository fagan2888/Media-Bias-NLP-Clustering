David Vitter. \u201cThat\u2019s an exemption, plain and simple.\u201d\n\nFACTS:\n\nWhen Obamacare was passed into law, Sen. Charles Grassley, the Iowa Republican, attached language to the bill that mandated members of Congress and their staffers would have to buy health insurance on the newly created health insurance exchanges. What nobody accounted for at the time was that members of Congress and their staffers currently have health insurance through their employer \u2013 the federal government. No other employer has been legally required to drop its employee\u2019s health care plan and have them buy coverage on the exchanges.\n\nLike most other large employers, the federal government contributes a portion to the premiums of its employees. In fact, like many employers, the federal government pays most of the premiums for its workers; an average of 72 percent on Capitol Hill. The law didn\u2019t account for the continued employer contribution for these federal workers who would now be buying their insurance on the exchanges. The exchanges were designed to help people without health insurance and people with overly expensive health insurance. It became clear that without their employer contribution, members and their staffers would essentially be getting a cut in pay and benefits equal to thousands of dollars. Even Grassley, the provision\u2019s author, had said the government should continue to contribute to lawmakers\u2019 and staffers\u2019 premiums. What the Obama administration has done is ruled that the congressional workers will continue to receive the employer contribution to help them buy their insurance on the exchange.\n\n\n\nVERDICT:\n\nFalse. Congress is no more exempt than any other employer who drops coverage and then helps employees purchase insurance on the exchanges.", "article_metadata": {"description": "ASSERTION: President Obama exempted members of Congress from Obamacare. \u201cPresident Obama recently issued a special rule for Congress and congressional staff to get a special subsidy to purchase health insurance on the Obamacare Exchange unavailable to every other American at similar income lev...", "generator": "WordPress.com", "title": "Fact Check: Congress, staff are exempt from Obamacare", "og": {"url": "http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2013/09/25/fact-check-congress-staff-are-exempt-from-obamacare/", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/130924200411-capitol-building-0904-horizontal-gallery.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "ASSERTION:\r\nPresident Obama exempted members of Congress from Obamacare.\r\n\r\n\u201cPresident Obama recently issued a special rule for Congress and congressional staff to get a special subsidy to purchase health insurance on the Obamacare Exchange unavailable to every other American at similar income lev...", "title": "Fact Check: Congress, staff are exempt from Obamacare"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "- All politics, all the time", "fb": {"admins": 690014395, "app_id": 80401312489}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CNN Political Ticker", "keywords": "fact check obamacare, health care, cnn staff", "google-site-verification": "mFBa4OnyEDU23vgVJ6rtX_4izud7FIi9JiscfVsWaKk", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf11b\"", "article_summary": "The exchanges were designed to help people without health insurance and people with overly expensive health insurance.\nEven Grassley, the provision\u2019s author, had said the government should continue to contribute to lawmakers\u2019 and staffers\u2019 premiums.\nCongress is no more exempt than any other employer who drops coverage and then helps employees purchase insurance on the exchanges.\nWhat nobody accounted for at the time was that members of Congress and their staffers currently have health insurance through their employer \u2013 the federal government.\n3 years agoASSERTION:President Obama exempted members of Congress from Obamacare."}
