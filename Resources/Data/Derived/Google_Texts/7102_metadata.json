Or maybe you\u2019ll hear a radio spot or see a TV ad delivering the same type of message.\n\nYour city council may pass a proclamation \u201ccelebrating\u201d and \u201cwelcoming\u201d the \u201ccultural diversity\u201d and economic benefits of refugees and other \u201cnew Americans.\u201d\n\nYour local public library will start hosting \u201cstory times\u201d that glorify the role of immigrants and the value of diversity in your community.\n\nYou may also see a new HUD-backed subsidized housing project rising from the ground. But the biggest sign that new arrivals are on their way, will be the \u201cmessaging\u201d sent out through local media and official government offices.\n\nBelow is an example of the ads circulating in North Carolina sponsored by a group called Welcoming America, which was started in 2010 with seed money from billionaire George Soros and now works with the federal government to influence Americans\u2019 attitudes toward immigration.\n\nIt\u2019s all part of a strategy, reported on last week by WND, to \u201cwater the soil\u201d and \u201cplant seedlings\u201d into host communities, also called \u201creceiving communities.\u201d\n\nWND also reported last week how the federal government withholds key information from the public in host communities until right before or after refugees arrive, and how one congressman, Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., is demanding answers to 17 questions about the program.\n\nObama\u2019s ramped-up strategy to integrate new immigrants is about to be unfurled upon unsuspecting cities and counties across the U.S. They will be expected to follow the federal plan to \u201cbuild welcoming communities\u201d that empower migrants and refugees, turning them into \u201cnew Americans.\u201d\n\nOnce the soil has been prepared, the seedlings will arrive. And the seedlings, according to those planning the changes for your city or town, need to be nurtured and cultivated into healthy communities of their own. They will eventually be fully \u201cintegrated,\u201d meaning they are firmly established and able to grow within their host community, eventually overtaking the host.\n\nThe plans to transform America through immigration, as spelled out in the new White House report, involves almost every government agency working in tandem with community organizers from immigrant-rights groups like National Council for La Raza and the National Partnership for New Americans. The White House task force is headed by Cecilia Munoz, former top executive with La Raza and now Obama\u2019s top domestic policy adviser.\n\nThe report is chock full of programs, goals, plans and strategies to build welcoming \u201creceiving communities\u201d and give immigrants all they need to prosper economically, linguistically and politically.\n\nThe document is permeated with Orwellian euphemisms, starting with the title, \u201cStrengthening Communities by Welcoming all Residents,\u201d and continuing with its declaration of the \u201ceconomic benefits of immigrant and refugee integration.\u201d\n\nCritics argue the plan will do the exact opposite, weakening stable communities by delivering a steady dose of low-skilled immigrants who will place a burden on schools and social services. The new arrivals are likely to be seen working as hotel maids, toiling in meat-packing plants, as cashiers at big-box stores, dishwashers or other low-wage jobs that require food stamps, subsidized housing and other forms of government assistance.\n\nJudicial Watch, the Washington, D.C.-based government watchdog organization, predicted Wednesday that cities and counties will be \u201cstrong-armed into participating in this immigrant welcoming effort.\u201d\n\nOne way that could happen is through the withholding of various federal block grants for development projects for cities that don\u2019t participate, while showering communities that do participate with new grant money.\n\nThe report cites, \u201cA large body of academic research has shown that immigration benefits the U.S. economy as a whole, the communities in which immigrants live and the businesses where they work.\u201d\n\nConveniently omitted, says Judicial Watch\u2019s review of the report, are the devastating impacts of illegal immigration, \u201clike the billions of dollars American taxpayers spend annually on their education, health care and incarceration.\u201d\n\nThe White House plan calls for the marshaling of almost every federal agency to participate in creating welcoming communities.\n\nFor \u201ceffective integration we need a comprehensive national and local effort that draws on the strengths and capacity of all sectors of society and all levels of government \u2013 a \u2018whole of society\u2019 approach,\u201d the report states.\n\nPartners will include schools, libraries, corporations, universities, and community-based organizations, to name a few. In other words, an army of community organizers, bureaucrats and technocrats who will soon descend on local communities nationwide pushing for more welcoming environments for refugees and immigrants.\n\nThe plan calls for using existing federal funding opportunities and putting pressure on Congress to create a new \u201crevenue stream\u201d that will fund a host of new integration programs.\n\nObama created the Task Force on New Americans in November after he unilaterally granted amnesty to more than 5 million illegal aliens. The administration\u2019s robust refugee resettlement program has been added to the mix with a focus on refugees from Somalia, Iraq, Syria, the Democratic Republic of Congo and other Muslim nations.\n\nMaking immigrants feel welcome\n\nThe task force will also consider holding regional summits to encourage state, regional and local planning.\u201d\n\nStates already ahead of the game in preparing to welcome \u201cnew Americans\u201d are Illinois, Michigan, Massachusetts and New York, the report said. These states have created new offices to serve immigrants, offered new programs to meet their needs, and provided mobile units to \u201chelp new Americans feel welcome.\u201d\n\nIllinois, for example, uses mobile units to hold \u201cservice fairs\u201d or \u201cwelcoming days.\u201d These programs will \u201censure that approximately 11,000 new Americans receive access to services,\u201d the report says.\n\nThe cities of Dayton, Ohio; Baltimore, Maryland; High Point, North Carolina; Chicago; New York City; Los Angeles and Boston were held up as examples for other cities to emulate in the way of welcoming and integrating new immigrants and refugees.\n\nBoston, L.A., New York and Chicago were all lauded for creating new bureaucratic offices with the sole purpose being to \u201cserve immigrant populations.\u201d\n\nChicago, for instance, created a \u201cNew American Plan\u201d in 2012 that includes \u201cstrategies to ensure that the city\u2019s diverse immigrant population is empowered.\u201d\n\nCities are also encouraged in the report to \u201ccelebrate World Refugee Day on June 20\u201d with film screenings, soccer tournaments and community dialogues.\n\n\u2018Feeding growth in government\u2019\n\nSteven Comarata, director of research for the Center for Immigration Studies, said these types of government overreaches should be expected when immigration levels are as high as they are today.\n\n\u201cIt seems almost inevitable with an immigration policy of open borders and the numbers that we\u2019ve seen, both legal and illegal, coming into the country, to the point where one in 10 Americans are now recent immigrants,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to new Census projections, the U.S. immigrant population is on track to reach its highest percentage ever of the overall population in just eight years.\n\n\u201cThe rise of identity- and grievance-based politics will take over,\u201d Comarata said. \u201cImmigration is not the reasons for multiculturalism, but it is the pure oxygen that allows the fires of the progressive ideology to burn so hot.\u201d\n\nComarata\u2019s organization, CIS, has been pushing Congress to reduce the numbers of immigrants entering the country, which would reduce the pressure on government to accommodate their needs.\n\n\u201cNow you could say, \u2018Hey, they can fend for themselves,\u2019 but the reality is the presence of enormous numbers will create tremendous pressure for the government to do more,\u201d he said.\n\nYou can say, \u2018Tough, what do I care,\u2019 but the fact of the matter is that in that environment the argument for the government to do more is going to be heard all the more sympathetically, by folks who are not even necessarily liberal. They\u2019re going to say, \u2018Hey, we\u2019ve got an explosion of child poverty.'\u201d\n\nFor example, he said 68 percent of the growth in the uninsured population comes from new immigrants and their children. \u201cAnd what is one of the main arguments for Obamacare? It\u2019s the growth in the uninsured.\n\n\u201cSo immigration, without question, creates pressure for more government programs. It\u2019s a powerful motivator, and that\u2019s where we\u2019re headed.\u201d\n\nStudies show that immigrants themselves generally have a more positive view of government action than indigenous Americans, Comarata said.\n\n\u201cSo you can see why Democrats have an interest, even if it means there may be fewer benefits available for their traditional voting bloc,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir political interests trump concern for their constituents.\u201d\n\nSo these are not your great-grandmother\u2019s type of immigrant, when loads of Italians, Germans and Irish came to the U.S. in the early 1900s with nothing and had to work hard and scrape their way to a middle-class lifestyle.\n\n\u201cThat era is gone and long dead,\u201d Comarata said. \u201cIn 1900, federal and state and local expenditures amounted to 5 percent of GDP; it\u2019s now up to 35 percent of GDP. That was before the rise of things like race-specific policies, before the rise of identity-based and grievance-based politics. La Raza didn\u2019t exist back then. We\u2019re looking at truly unprecedented numbers and percentages, and you get an inevitable rise in government services and the overall size of government.\u201d\n\nComarata also stresses that legal immigration is a much bigger piece of the overall immigration pie than illegal immigration, with 1.1 million legal immigrants entering the country each year. That compares to approximately 100,000 to 200,000 illegals.\n\n\u201cAnd we\u2019re having absolutely no debate at all on that,\u201d he said.\n\nMore from the report\n\nHere\u2019s a sampling of goals and objectives contained in the White House task force\u2019s 70-page report:\n\nReduce \u201cbarriers to citizenship,\u201d such as making the citizenship test easier for elderly immigrants.\n\nTrain immigrants and refugees to be citizen activists, expanding opportunities for them to \u201cengage in their receiving communities,\u201d because, coming from various Third World environments \u201cthey may not be aware of its importance or how they can effect change at the local, state and federal levels.\u201d\n\nLower citizenship fees for some immigrants and allow others to pay by credit card.\n\nMake sure immigrants and refugees wanting to start small businesses have access to start-up capital.\n\nThe federal government will actively \u201cencourage local governments to develop and implement local immigrant and refugee integration strategies \u2013 providing technical assistance and other opportunities to participating communities and put them on the path to building welcoming communities.\u201d\n\nThe federal task force will provide a toolkit to the \u201cwilling but unable\u201d cities and counties \u201cto guide these communities in their welcoming efforts and share information on federal funding streams and initiatives.\u201d\n\nA New Americans Corps will be created through the existing AmeriCorps volunteer program and these armies of volunteers will work to \u201cbuild capacity\u201d in the movement to welcome and integrate New Americans into communities nationwide.\n\nEmphasize existing funding opportunities to assist new Americans.\n\nIncrease opportunities for communities to use federal funding streams to develop and implement local integration plans.\n\n\u201cCulturally and linguistically appropriate services\u201d must be delivered to immigrants in health and health care and other areas of need.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "What are the signs that your community has been secretly selected for an infusion of refugees from Muslim nations like Syria or Somalia, or migrant workers from Central America?
