Gov. Pat McCrory says he supports the bill.\n\nNorth Carolina taxpayers pick up about 25 to 30 percent of the cost of Medicaid, with the federal government paying the rest.\n\nIn exchange, the program provides care to 1.8 million North Carolinians \u2013 roughly one out of every five residents \u2013 from poor pregnant women to developmentally disabled adults to children living in poverty.\n\nHouse Bill 372 will convert Medicaid from a fee-for-service program to a managed care model, in which insurers are paid a flat fee per patient they cover. The move is a bid to control costs, which Republican lawmakers said have too often absorbed money that could be put toward education and other needs.\n\nNorth Carolina will need permission from the federal government to make all of these changes. Although state agencies are directed to apply to the federal government for the transition in the middle of next year, lawmakers say the expect the actual transition process to take about two or three years.\n\n\"I would be shocked if that process takes less than 12 months,\" said Rep. Donny Lambeth, R-Forsyth.\n\nMore likely, Lambeth said, it will take 18 to 24 months to wrangle federal approval.\n\n\"North Carolina will not be viewed as a friendly state,\" he said, noting Republicans leaders here have refused expand Medicaid coverage as allowed under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nOnce the federal government signs off, he said, it will take another 18 months to fully make the transition.\n\nCapping expenses\n\nSince taking control of the General Assembly in 2011, Republicans have looked for ways to curb spending on the program. In particular, they have said that the fee-for-service model \u2013 in which doctors and other health care providers are paid for each individual service they provide \u2013 has led to growing health care costs.\n\nOver the past two years, there has been general agreement among GOP leaders that Medicaid ought to be based on a managed care model. But what exactly that model should look like, how quickly that transition should take place and how the remade program should be overseen have been huge sticking points.\n\nFor example, one draft of House Bill 372 would have taken oversight of the program away from Gov. Pat McCrory's Department of Health and Human Services and turned it over to a newly-appointed board. McCrory, backed by the House, fought that idea.\n\nBut on Thursday, he praised the compromise reached by legislative negotiators.\n\n\"No one gave us a chance for Medicaid reform, and we\u2019ve come together, I think, on a very good Medicaid reform package,\" McCrory told WRAL News' David Crabtree on Thursday.\n\nLawmakers made a breakthrough in mid-August that virtually guaranteed they could reach a compromise this year. The key compromise was allowing both big for-profit managed care insurers as well as locally created provider-led entities to care for patients. Provider-led entities are groups created by doctors, hospitals and other health care providers.\n\nThere will be three statewide slots that could be filled by either kind of insurer. The state will also be carved into six or seven regions. Only provider-led entities could sign up to care for patients within those regions.\n\nPatients will be able to choose whether they want to have their health care managed by one of the statewide groups or one of the regional entities.\n\nSome doctors are unhappy with the inclusion of large managed care insurers.\n\n\"We oppose the General Assembly\u2019s decision to involve corporate managed care in our Medicaid program,\" said Robert Seligson, CEO, North Carolina Medical Society. \"Including some of the patient protections we requested such as performance standards based on quality, cost and patient experience is an improvement. This is not the end of the Medicaid reform debate. We will continue to work with our partners and the state\u2019s leaders on the many decisions that lie ahead to enable the delivery of high value medical care to our state\u2019s most vulnerable citizens.\"\n\nThere are exceptions to these broad guidelines. For example, the state Medicaid system will continue to pay dentists directly rather than putting dental care in the hands of the new private insurers.\n\nThe state's existing LME-MCOs, which manage mental health care, will be allowed to keep operating for at least four years. After that, Lambeth said, it's possible mental health care could be turned over to the insurers covering physical health issues.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=1;polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=5;cycle=1", "dcterms.created": "2015-09-17 20:41:00", "description": "A long awaited compromise on how to run the state's health insurance system for the poor and disabled will put North Carolina's Medicaid program in the hands of private insurers.", "application-name": "WRAL.com", "dcterms.modified": "2015-09-18 18:38:13", "outbrain": {"ob_desc": "id_asset=14907378|asset_type=blogpost"}, "twitter": {"description": "A long awaited compromise on how to run the state's health insurance system for the poor and disabled will put North Carolina's Medicaid program in the hands of private insurers.", "title": "Compromise reached on how to privatize Medicaid :: WRAL.com", "url": "http://www.wral.com/compromise-on-how-to-privatize-medicaid-reached/14907378/", "image": "http://wwwcache.wral.com/asset/lifestyles/healthteam/2007/08/03/1665704/1665704-1420804035-160x120.jpg", "site": "@wral", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#041E30", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "robots": "index,follow", "pinterest": "nohover", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/favicons/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"app_id": 334167666672300}, "author": "WRAL", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-17T20:41:00-04:00"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "og": {"site_name": "WRAL.com", "description": "A long awaited compromise on how to run the state's health insurance system for the poor and disabled will put North Carolina's Medicaid program in the hands of private insurers.", "title": "Compromise reached on how to privatize Medicaid :: WRAL.com", "url": "http://www.wral.com/compromise-on-how-to-privatize-medicaid-reached/14907378/", "image": "http://wwwcache.wral.com/asset/lifestyles/healthteam/2007/08/03/1665704/1665704-1420804035-646x485.jpg", "type": "article"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msapplication-TileImage": "/favicons/mstile-144x144.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca39c\"", "article_summary": "The key compromise was allowing both big for-profit managed care insurers as well as locally created provider-led entities to care for patients.\nThe state's existing LME-MCOs, which manage mental health care, will be allowed to keep operating for at least four years.\nOver the past two years, there has been general agreement among GOP leaders that Medicaid ought to be based on a managed care model.\n\"We oppose the General Assembly\u2019s decision to involve corporate managed care in our Medicaid program,\" said Robert Seligson, CEO, North Carolina Medical Society.\nAfter that, Lambeth said, it's possible mental health care could be turned over to the insurers covering physical health issues."}
