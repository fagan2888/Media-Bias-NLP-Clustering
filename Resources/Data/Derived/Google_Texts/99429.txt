The global market bloodletting continues as the sell-off has officially reached historic levels.

Following Fridayâ€™s mind-numbing 530-point sell-off in the Dow, which sent the blue-chip index into a correction, US stock market futures are plummeting again.

Dow futures are down as much as 700 points. S&P futures are down 75 points. Nasdaq futures are down 208.

At current prices, the S&P 500 has joined the Dow in a correction, which is defined as a 10% decline from most recent highs.

And the sell-off is across asset classes, worldwide.
