We are now prepared to expand our Meridian Choice offerings to include family plans for 2015 and are looking forward to providing more options along with access to high quality care for our members.\"\n\nMeridian Choice is an affordable option for anyone in the Marketplace looking for health insurance. While other plans in Kalamazoo, Van Buren and Calhoun counties are increasing costs for members in 2015, Meridian Choice is decreasing rates by nearly 14 percent.\n\n\"Our decreased rates make us a strong competitor in the marketplace,\" Kendall said. \"With four levels of coverage including individual and family plan offerings at each, and our reduced rates, we are certain consumers in southwest Michigan will find a Meridian Choice plan that meets all of their healthcare needs.\"\n\nMeridian Choice is a Qualified Health Plan (QHP) under the Affordable Care Act (ACA).
