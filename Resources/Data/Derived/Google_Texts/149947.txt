After a week that shifted the political goal posts towards his progressive agenda, President Obama gave one of his most critically acclaimed speeches as he eulogized the Rev. Clementa Pinckney who was murdered last week along with eight others in a church in Charleston, South Carolina. Obama said, "As a nation, out of this terrible tragedy, God has visited grace upon us for he has allowed us to see where we've been blind. He's given us the chance, where we've been lost, to find our best selves." And he began singing “Amazing Grace,” as the surprised mourners stood up and joined him. Obama’s 20 minute eulogy is posted below.
