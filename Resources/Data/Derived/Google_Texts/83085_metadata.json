But for workers at one major company those fears appear to be easing.\n\nFood service giant Sodexo unexpectedly reversed course Thursday after bumping thousands of college cafeteria workers from its health plan earlier this year and casting blame on the health care law.\n\nJulie Peterson, Sodexo\u2019s vice president for benefits, said the company will make changes for next year to restore eligibility for many of those affected.\n\nAlthough Sodexo says the reversal was part of a standard review of major policy decisions, the company also faced a union organizing drive and campus protests.\n\nEconomists say it may be getting harder for employers to cut benefits.\n\n\u201cWe are in an environment now with falling unemployment rates,\u201d said Paul Fronstin of the nonpartisan Employee Benefit Research Institute. \u201cIn some cases employers will be able to do that without losing benefits, but in others not.\u201d\n\nAmong those who lost their coverage through Sodexo this year \u2014 and may now get it back \u2014 was Julie Pemberton. She\u2019s a cashier at Curry College, a liberal arts institution near Boston.\n\nPemberton puts in more than 40 hours a week during the academic year. She\u2019s paying more than $200 a month more in premiums since she switched to a plan from the Massachusetts health insurance exchange.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m actually looking for a new apartment because this is just draining any savings I have,\u201d said Pemberton. \u201cI can\u2019t just keep paying and paying and paying.\u201d\n\nUNITE HERE, a labor union trying to organize Sodexo workers, said the company\u2019s initial cutback was facilitated by what it calls a loophole in federal regulations carrying out the health law\u2019s employer coverage requirement.\n\nThe Obama administration says any fault is with the employer, not the health care law.\n\nFrench-owned Sodexo is a multinational service company with U.S. headquarters in Maryland. It operates many college cafeterias and also provides other campus services. In January, Sodexo reclassified some of its workers as part-time by averaging their hours over a 52-week calendar year. That affected about 5,000 of its 133,000 U.S. employees.\n\nSodexo said it was acting to align itself with the health care law, which requires that employers with 50 or more workers offer coverage to those averaging at least 30 hours a week, or face fines.\n\nPeterson said Thursday that for benefits purposes, the company will now credit campus employees during the summer break with the hours they would have worked during the academic year.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve realized we can change the way we are determining eligibility and still remain competitive in the market,\u201d Peterson said.\n\nThe UNITE HERE union says federal rules require colleges and universities to essentially do the same thing for their faculty employees. But those rules don\u2019t apply to contractor employees in cafeterias.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing in there that says contract workers are protected,\u201d said union spokesman Ethan Snow.\n\nAt least one college that examined the issue agreed with the cafeteria workers. Earlham College in Richmond, Indiana, recently amended its contract with Sodexo to require that the employees be offered coverage.\n\n\u201cSodexo\u2019s classification system was not consistent with the practices of other vendors, or with Earlham\u2019s policies,\u201d said Sena Landey, vice president for finance at the Quaker-founded liberal arts institution.\n\nLandey said it looks like a slip-up on the part of federal regulators.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t understand why you would benefit faculty and not those on the lower end of the pay scale,\u201d Landey said. \u201cI don\u2019t see the logic in it.\u201d\n\nThe mandate that larger employers provide health coverage is one of the most complicated parts of the health care law. Lawmakers intended it mainly as a safeguard against companies shifting their traditional responsibility for health insurance to taxpayers.\n\nBut employers across a range of industries have cited the mandate as justification for everything from limiting workers\u2019 hours to scaling back coverage for spouses. Supporters of the law say the requirement will have a negligible impact since more than 90 percent of larger employers already provide coverage.\n\nOriginally scheduled to take effect this year, the mandate has been delayed twice. Companies with 100 or more workers must comply starting next year, while businesses with 50 to 99 employees have until 2016. Smaller companies are exempt.\n\nThe law also requires individuals to carry insurance or risk fines, and that provision took effect this year.\n\nOn another issue, Sodexo and the White House are allies. This spring, the company earned official recognition by pledging to add more nutritious options to its vending and K-12 lunchroom programs in support of first lady Michelle Obama\u2019s campaign to reduce childhood obesity.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Many employees who already have health insurance worry they'll pay a price for President Barack Obama's overhaul.
