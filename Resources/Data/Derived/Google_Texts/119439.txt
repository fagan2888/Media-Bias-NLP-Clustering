CONCORD, N.C. â€“ North Carolina voters had a chance to hear from Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump on Monday ahead of next week's primary.

Thousands packed the Cabarrus Arena and Event Center in Concord for a Trump rally on Monday afternoon.

During his remarks Trump talked about his plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act, end the heroin problem in North Carolina and increase jobs in the state.

"You look at our deficits, you look at our budgets, you look at what's going on in our country...we're losing our jobs and the politicians don't tell you that. I actually think a lot of them don't know. Most of them that do know, they're controlled by special interests that own companies in other countries," said Donald Trump.

The U.S. Department of Labor recently reported the country is at the lowest unemployment rate since February of 2008.

This isn't the only stop Trump plans to make in North Carolina. On Wednesday, he'll make his way to Fayetteville for a rally at the Crown Center Coliseum. Both events are free, but people will need tickets to get in. They are available on his website.

The North Carolina primary election is set for March 15. Early voting is already underway.
