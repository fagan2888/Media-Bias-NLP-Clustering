Story highlights Jeb Bush said Wednesday he doesn't believe Donald Trump's claims that "thousands" of American Muslims cheered the 9/11 attacks

Trump and his aides have stood by the statements

Washington (CNN) Jeb Bush said Wednesday that he doesn't believe Donald Trump's claim that "thousands" of American Muslims cheered the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.

"I don't believe it happened. I know many Muslims that were just as angry and saddened by the attack on our country. I don't believe it," Bush told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on "New Day."
