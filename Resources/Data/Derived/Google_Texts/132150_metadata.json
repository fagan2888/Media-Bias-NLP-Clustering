Sam Brownback and Democratic challenger Paul Davis sparred over education, taxes, economic development and more during their second debate, before 250 business leaders Friday, Sept. 19, 2014, in Overland Park. Thumbnails \u00b7 Gallery\n\n\u0097 All three candidates for governor faced each other Friday during a debate in Johnson County, answering questions about tax policy, economic development, education funding and a variety of issues.\n\nFor the most part, though, the major candidates stuck to their key talking points, with Republican Gov. Sam Brownback boasting that his tax cuts are producing economic growth, while Rep. Paul Davis, the Democratic candidate from Lawrence, promised to restore cuts in base aid to public schools that have occurred under the Brownback administration.\n\nMeanwhile, Libertarian candidate Keen Umbehr used the debate to promote his \u201cfair tax\u201d that would eliminate income taxes for everyone and replace them with a statewide consumption tax.\n\nThe candidates also tailored their remarks to the Johnson County audience, especially when criticizing each other.\n\n\u201cRepresentative Davis talks about more money for schools, but he\u2019s not talking about your schools. He is talking about your money,\u201d Brownback said, suggesting that Johnson County as a whole accounts for a large percentage of the taxes paid into the state and therefore helps subsidize the school budgets of less populous, less wealthy areas.\n\nDavis fired back, saying Johnson County has suffered under the education cuts, which he blamed on Brownback\u2019s policy of cutting taxes.\n\n\u201cI talked to a school teacher the other day in Shawnee Mission who told me she\u2019s got over 30 kids in her class and she can\u2019t even get a paraprofessional,\u201d Davis said. \u201cThat is not how we are going to grow our economy.\u201d\n\nThe forum, sponsored by the Johnson County Public Policy Council, took place just as a new poll was released from Rasmussen Reports showing the race tightening, with Davis now leading Brownback by four percentage points.\n\nAn earlier Rasmussen poll showed Davis up by 10 points. It was the third poll in the last week showing Davis with a single-digit lead.\n\nThe candidates were also asked about their positions on health care and implementation of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nHealth care expansion\n\nBrownback said he opposed the federal law, also known as Obamacare, and said implementing it in Kansas would cost more than $1 billion.\n\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t seen the big hammer from Obamacare yet, that\u2019s coming after the election,\u201d Brownback said.\n\nHe also argued that if Davis is elected, he would expand Medicaid, and a large share of the $1 billion cost would come from Johnson County.\n\nThe $1 billion figure represents the total cost to the state over 10 years. Campaign officials said it comes from a study released in January that was commissioned by the Kansas Department of Health and Environment. It includes the cost of insuring those who would become newly eligible if Medicaid were expanded as well as the cost of additional people who are already eligible and are expected to enroll because of new outreach efforts.\n\nDavis has not committed to expanding Medicaid, but he has spoken favorably about it, saying Kansas hospitals are losing revenue by providing uncompensated care for people who could be insured if the state took part in the Medicaid expansion.\n\nAfter saying that he also believes the federal law has problems, he turned the question around to criticize Brownback\u2019s own health care plan, the privatization of Medicaid known as KanCare. That plan was intended to reduce Medicaid costs through managed care administered by private insurance companies.\n\nDavis argued that program is not working.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got for-profit insurance companies that have not met any of the benchmarks that have been set out for them,\u201d Davis said.\n\nWhen asked about their approach to tax policy, Brownback defended his record of dramatic cuts in income taxes, saying it has spurred economic growth, especially in Johnson County, which he said is attracting businesses from neighboring Missouri because of the lower taxes.\n\n\u201cThis is the right direction for us to go, to get that income tax down,\u201d Brownback said.\n\nUmbehr, however, said Brownback\u2019s tax plan is unfair because it allows business owners who receive pass-through income from their businesses to pay no tax, while lower income wage earners still pay tax.\n\n\u201cOur tax policy right now allows 191,000 business owners to pay zero while 1.4 million wage earners pay it all,\u201d Umbehr said.\n\nDavis said Brownback\u2019s tax policies have not produced the economic benefits he promised.\n\n\u201cHis own council of economic advisors several months ago documented the state of Kansas is lagging behind the surrounding states in virtually every economic growth indicator there is,\u201d Davis said.\n\nRenewable energy\n\nThe candidates were also asked about their positions on energy policy, and specifically the state\u2019s \u201crenewable portfolio standards,\u201d or RPS, which require utility companies to produce at least 20 percent of the electricity they sell from renewable sources such as wind power.\n\nBrownback has at times given conflicting statements, at one time saying he supports the wind industry and the renewable standards, and at other times saying he would also support phasing out the standards. On Friday, he said he wants the industry itself to come to its own consensus on what to do.\n\n\u201cWhat I have said is I want to see all sides come together,\u201d Brownback said. \u201cAnd if they come together around some proposal that says we want to do something different, like a tax credit, I could go with that. If they say not, I\u2019m not going to do it.\u201d\n\nDavis said he supports the renewable standards and fought off efforts in the Legislature to repeal it.\n\n\u201cWithout RPS, we are sending a very strong message to the wind industry that Kansas is not open for business,\u201d Davis said. \u201cWe would be the first state in the country to repeal its RPS.\u201d\n\nUmbehr said he opposes the renewable standards and he opposes property tax abatements for wind towers, saying such abatements rob money from public school districts.\n\nCopyright 2016 The Lawrence Journal-World.
