Michael Abrams makes the claim ["Reverse Rural Hospital Decline," March 24, 2016] the Affordable Care Act is the seemingly only cause of hospital closures in recent years, yet he provides not one bit of evidence for his opinion. Yes, the act has created additional reporting measures, but that is not what is causing hospital closures. More likely, it is the changing demographics of rural America – population declines and an aging population. Data also shows that more hospitals are closing in states that did not implement one of the act's biggest benefits – Medicaid expansion.
