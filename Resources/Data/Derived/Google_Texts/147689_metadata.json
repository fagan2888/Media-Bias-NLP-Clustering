Ted Cruz (R-TX) that fewer and fewer people were backing his crusade to repeal President Barack Obama\u2019s health care reform law.\n\n\u201cI think at this point it is abundantly clear this thing it isn\u2019t working,\u201d Cruz told the Fox News hosts the morning after the White House announced that it was on track to meet its goal of 7 million enrollees. \u201cYou can\u2019t fiddle around the edges. I think it is the essence of pragmatism to recognize this thing isn\u2019t working, and let\u2019s start over, let\u2019s repeal every word of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know, you\u2019re kind of in a minority when it comes to that,\u201d host Steve Doocy pointed out. \u201cYou look at the polling, Senator, and a lot of Americans like parts of it, would like to see parts of it continue. So, to blow the whole thing up, I don\u2019t know if people are behind that.\u201d\n\nCruz, however, insisted that \u201cevery poll that\u2019s done\u201d showed that the Affordable Care Act was the \u201cprofoundly most unpopular law we\u2019ve seen in modern times.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s going to be repealed because I think the American people are demanding it,\u201d the Texas Republican added.\n\nCo-host Brian Kilmeade reminded Cruz that Americans supported many provisions of the Affordable Care Act, like protecting people who have preexisting conditions.\n\n\u201cAre you going to go through elements of that to replace it, and where is the Cruz plan?\u201d Kilmeade pressed.\n\nThe senator didn\u2019t indicate that he had a specific plan to replace the president\u2019s law, but instead repeated some conservative principles: allow insurance to be sold across state lines, health savings accounts, and decoupling health insurance from employment.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what Americans want,\u201d he concluded.\n\nWatch the video below from Fox News\u2019 Fox & Friends, broadcast April 1, 2014.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/fox_ff_cruz_repeal_140401a-2-800x430.jpg", "height": 430}, "title": "Fox host tells Ted Cruz: \u2018You\u2019re in a minority\u2019 on Obamacare repeal, people aren\u2019t \u2018behind that\u2019"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "article_summary": "Ted Cruz (Fox News)The hosts of Fox & Friends on Tuesday warned Sen.
