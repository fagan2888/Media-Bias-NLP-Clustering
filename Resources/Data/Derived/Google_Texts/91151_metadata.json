In 2014 we are focusing on the markets where we can be most competitive and deliver the greatest value to our customers.\n\n\"It is important to note that this decision does not impact our existing business in the state. We are committed to the Louisiana market and will continue to serve individual consumers in the off-exchange market, as well as small and large employers.\n\n\"We will continue to assess our ability to participate on Louisiana\u2019s exchange in 2015 and beyond.\"\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story incorrectly described the area Vantage Health Care plans to serve. This post has been updated to reflect the company's plan to market its products to residents in all but 10 Louisiana parishes.", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "Rebecca Catalanello, NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune", "medium": "news", "news_keywords": "health care reform,louisiana health care", "title": "Coventry's decision to withdraw from Louisiana's Obamacare exchange 'not made lightly,' spokesman says", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Coventry\\u0027s decision to withdraw from Louisiana\\u0027s Obamacare exchange \\u0027not made lightly,\\u0027 spokesman says\", \"link\": \"http://www.nola.com/health/index.ssf/2013/09/coventrys_decision_to_withdraw.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nola.com/home/nola-media/width620/img/health_impact/photo/13396528-standard.png\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11278419\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-09-20T12:09:08Z\", \"author\": \"Rebecca Catalanello, NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune\", \"tags\": [\"health care reform\",\"louisiana health care\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.nola.com/health_impact/photo/13396528-thumb_square_large.png", "description": "A Coventry Health Care spokesman says the insurance company is taking a &#8220;measured, multi-year approach&#8221; to its participation in the health care exchanges that will open up nationally on Oct. 1.The company informed the Louisiana Department of Insurance a few...", "site": "@nolanews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@RCatNola"}, "article_date_updated": "Monday, September 23, 2013,  4:31 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.nola.com/health_impact/photo/health-care-infopng-2effecf855a3952e.png\", \"author_name\": \"rcatalanello\", \"author_nickname\": \"Rebecca Catalanello, NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune\", \"author_id\": \"8224863\", \"source_blog_name\": \"New Orleans Health and Health Care\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nola.com/health/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NOLA.com", "description": "A Coventry Health Care spokesman says the insurance company is taking a &#8220;measured, multi-year approach&#8221; to its participation in the health care exchanges that will open up nationally on Oct. 1.The company informed the Louisiana Department of Insurance a few...", "title": "Coventry's decision to withdraw from Louisiana's Obamacare exchange 'not made lightly,' spokesman says", "url": "http://www.nola.com/health/index.ssf/2013/09/coventrys_decision_to_withdraw.html", "image": "http://media.nola.com/design/alpha/img/logo_nola.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NOLA.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Friday, September 20, 2013,  7:00 AM", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "Description": "A Coventry Health Care spokesman says the insurance company is taking a &#8220;measured, multi-year approach&#8221; to its participation in the health care exchanges that will open up nationally on Oct. 1.
