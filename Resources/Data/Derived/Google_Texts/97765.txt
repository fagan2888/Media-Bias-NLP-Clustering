An anonymous donor from Hong Kong donated a $1 million donation to the families of the two NYPD officers killed last month.

Detectives Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos were on patrol together on Dec. 20 when they were shot dead in their car in Brooklyn by gunman Ismaaiyl Brinsley, 28, before he committed suicide.

Thanks to the donor, Liu’s father, Wei Tang Liu will receive $100,000 a year for five years and Ramos’ two sons will have $500,000 put towards their schooling, The Daily Mail reported. The money will be paid into the families’ funds by the police union.

The families gathered at a ceremony in Manhattan on Friday to accept the donation.

The gift was organized by Chinese daily newspaper Sing Tao, which was approached by the donor, The Daily Mail reported.

“In every tragedy there are individuals who step forward, step up to the plate,” said Michel Palladino, president of the Detectives Endowment Association, the Daily Mail reported.

Speaking in cantonese, Mr. Liu told the New York Daily news that he was very grateful for the donation.

“He’s just always expressing gratitude towards everyone for how much they have taken care of him and his whole family,” New York state Rep. Grace Meng told the New York Daily News. “He repeatedly, every time I speak to him, reminds us that Officer Liu was his one and only son. One and only child. And so obviously he is very heartbroken.”
