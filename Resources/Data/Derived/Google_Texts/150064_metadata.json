(MIKE SEGAR/REUTERS)\n\nHe spoke of the many hundreds of software bugs, inadequate computer hardware, terrible response times, frequent outages and crashes, significant weaknesses in how the project was being managed, and both slow decision-making and \"diffuse accountability.\"\n\nYet many problems remain, including on the so-called back end when it comes to getting correct personal information to insurers. Some elements, such as a Spanish-language section, are not online yet, either.\n\nBut the thrust of the administration's message Sunday was that it \"begins December with a vastly improved Web experience, but mindful of the frustrations of consumers.\"\n\nThe deadline for enrolling remains Mar. 31. By then the administration hopes to have 7 million enrolled.\n\nThat number is critical to support the economics of the Affordable Care Act. It is possible there will be pressure to extend the deadline if that target is not being met.\n\nPresident Obama's approval ratings have taken a huge hit amid criticism of the site.\n\nIt's unclear how improvements will change the negative perception, if at all.\n\njwarren@nydailynews.com", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "JAMES WARREN", "twitter": {"description": "It was short of declaring \"Mission Accomplished,\" but it wasn't too far off.", "title": "Obama administration boasts of website improvements", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/obama-administration-boasts-website-improvements-article-1.1534050", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1534048.1385916893!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/obama-budget.jpg", "site": "@nydailynews", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-author": "James Warren", "parsely-type": "article", "sailthru.credits": "NEW YORK DAILY NEWS", "nydn_tags": "obamacare", "parsely-pub-date": "2013-12-01T16:43:38", "parsely-link": "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/obama-administration-boasts-website-improvements-article-1.1534050", "parsely-title": "Obama administration boasts of website improvements", "sailthru.date": "2013-12-01T11:43:38-0500", "sailthru.title": "Obama administration boasts of website improvements", "nydn_section": "Politics", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1534048.1385916893!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/obama-budget.jpg", "description": "It was short of declaring \"Mission Accomplished,\" but it wasn't too far off.", "robots": "NOARCHIVE", "fb": {"admins": 1594068001, "app_id": 107464888913, "pages": 268914272540}, "msvalidate.01": "02916AAC0DA8B068EFE01D721E03ED7E", "parsely-section": "Politics", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NYDailyNews/"}, "sailthru.description": "It was short of declaring \"Mission Accomplished,\" but it wasn't too far off.", "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"site_name": "NY Daily News", "description": "It was short of declaring \"Mission Accomplished,\" but it wasn't too far off.", "title": "Obama administration boasts of website improvements", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/obama-administration-boasts-website-improvements-article-1.1534050", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1534048.1385916893!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/obama-budget.jpg", "type": "article"}, "parsely-tags": "obamacare", "p": {"domain_verify": "78efe4f5c9935744af497772f68a0ee7"}, "nydn_byline": "JAMES WARREN", "parsely-image-url": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1534048.1385916893!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/obama-budget.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0c3a\"", "article_summary": "The Obama administration on Sunday claimed major improvements in its problem-plagued health care website after a self-imposed Saturday deadline to repair the site.\nJeffrey Zients, a wealthy management consultant beckoned to be the administration's chief trouble-shooter, said response times are now one second, compared to eight seconds a month ago.\nThe Affordable Care Act signup page on the Healthcare.gov website has been heralded as a disaster since its rollout earlier this fall.\nIt's unclear how improvements will change the negative perception, if at all.\nYet many problems remain, including on the so-called back end when it comes to getting correct personal information to insurers."}
