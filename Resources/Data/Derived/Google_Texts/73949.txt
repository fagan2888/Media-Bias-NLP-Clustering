The Duchess of Cambridge has made her first public appearance since leaving hospital after the birth of Princess Charlotte as the Queen celebrated her official birthday with the pomp and pageantry of the Trooping the Colour ceremony.

Kate joined other members of the Royal Family as the monarch inspected 1,100 soldiers of the Household Division at Horse Guards Parade in central London.

Prince George joined his parents on the balcony of Buckingham Palace where the royals gathered to wave to the crowds in The Mall and to watch the traditional RAF fly-past.
