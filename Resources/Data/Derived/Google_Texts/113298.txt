LOS ANGELES — Super middleweight champion Andre Ward says he has signed with fledgling promoter Roc Nation Sports.

Ward announced the deal with hip-hop mogul Jay-Z’s new boxing promotion division Friday.

“Happy to be a part of the @RocNation family,” Ward posted on Instagram under a photo of the boxer and Jay-Z signing the contract.

The 30-year-old Ward (27-0, 14 KOs) has fought just twice in the last three years while engaging in a protracted legal fight with Goossen Promotions, which shepherded his rise from Olympic gold medalist to professional champion.

Ward is widely considered one of the world’s top pound-for-pound fighters, and he still holds the WBA’s 168-pound title despite his prolonged inactivity.

He won the belt with a victory over Mikkel Kessler in November 2009 in Oakland, California, Ward’s hometown.
