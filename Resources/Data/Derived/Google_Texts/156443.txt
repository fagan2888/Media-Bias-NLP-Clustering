“I think probably she did well enough in the debate that she’s going to get it, depending on what happens with the emails, but I think she’s being protected,” Trump told radio host John Catsimatidis on "The Cats Roundtable" on AM 970 New York on Sunday.

The Republican primary front-runner also said Vice President Biden missed his shot to enter the 2016 field.

“I think he’s not, cause I think it’s too late for him,” Trump said. “You know, he’s in a little bit of a honeymoon right now, people are saying all these wonderful things about him, but once he gets in and he gets beat up I think it’s going to be very hard.”

Trump added that his surging campaign is a unique phenomenon in political history, describing it as a “movement.”

“There hasn’t been anything like this politically, you know, from what they’re telling me,” he said. “I mean, there hasn’t really been anything, but this is a movement.”

He also said CNBC has been “terrific” and will do a “great job” after he threatened to pull out of the network's upcoming GOP primary debate if they did not change the format.
