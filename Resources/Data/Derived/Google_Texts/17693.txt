It's tough to think about - let alone talk about - but every year hundreds of children are victims of domestic and sexual abuse. In Walton County, those kids are currently being cared for in an old gas station.

Emerald Coast Children's Advocacy Center has been building a new facility in DeFuniak Springs - hoping the new space will serve as a home away from home for these victims.

"This has been an 18 month project, and we are just about at the end," said Art Miller, Board President for the Children's Advocacy Center. "There's now a place that children can go, families can now go to get help."

In two weeks time, the current CAC location will move to College Avenue to a brand new 15,000 square foot facility. Multiple agencies will be under one roof working to fight child abuse.

"It's not for the Center's benefit that we're opening; it's really for the community's benefit," added Miller.

While the center is structurally complete, inside there's still some work to be done.

The Walton County Sheriff's Office is working through the entire month of April to gather kitchen supplies to help get the center off to a great start. People can drop off donations at the Sheriff's Office and sub-stations - just look for the tub with the sign on the front.

"We just want to get them as prepared as possible, to get them all the help they need with socks, cookies, soda, water - that sort of thing so that they're prepared for when they open their doors," said Corey Dobridnia, the Public Affairs Coordinator for the Sheriff's Office.

The Pierce Family Children's Advocacy Center's grand opening will be April 8th at 10 a.m. The public will be invited to tour the facility.

In addition, there will be a Heroes for Children Family Fun Ride sponsored by the Department of Health and the CAC taking place on April 2nd. It begins at 9 a.m. at the new CAC location.
