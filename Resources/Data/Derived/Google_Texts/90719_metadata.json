Mary Fallin\u2019s watch has done pretty well for itself, according to the objective measurements most voters care about.\n\nAs a result, she has done pretty well for the reputation of the nation\u2019s 28 other Republican governors as a whole.\n\n\u201cWhen I took office, Oklahoma\u2019s unemployment was 7.2 percent, and now it\u2019s 4.6 percent,\u201d said Mrs. Fallin, 59, whose attraction to governance is in her genes. First her father and then her mother served as mayor of her hometown.\n\nSince she\u2019s been governor, the state has seen 80,000 jobs created, she says.\n\nOne of the accomplishments that makes her the proudest puts her state at the top of the heap when it comes to per-person income increases.\n\n\u201cOur per-capita income grew over 6 percent in the short span from 2011 to 2013,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the second-highest growth rate in this nation.\u201d\n\nSomething else put Oklahoma in the first tier of achievers among all states.\n\n\u201cOur gross domestic product growth rate is the fourth-highest in the United States, and its \u2018rainy-day\u2019 savings accounts have gone from a sad yet laughable $2.03 in 2010 to more than $530 million today,\u201d she said.\n\nWith former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton a possible presidential nominee for Democrats in 2016, Republicans think an accomplished woman who has proven managerial experience as a governor might be the perfect counter on the 2016 ticket.\n\nBut like other governors running for re-election, Mrs. Fallin, with a husband and six children, shuns presidential campaign speculation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not focused on presidential politics or any other office but the one I hold now. I\u2019m running for re-election, and I\u2019m working to make Oklahoma\u2019s economy the strongest it can possibly be.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s legitimate for people to ask me about the presidency,\u201d added the former two-term U.S. House member and former chairman of the Women\u2019s Congressional Caucus. \u201cI get asked about running for president all the time, but I\u2019m focused on running for governor.\u201d\n\nFocus is something she makes clear that she prizes as the underpinning of mothering and governing.\n\n\u201cThere may be a day when I think of doing something else in politics and public service. If that day comes, what will matter is how successful I have been leading the state of Oklahoma, creating more jobs here, improving education and caring for taxpayer dollars. So all of my energy and focus need to go into the job I have now, regardless of what my future holds.\u201d\n\nStill, it\u2019s a fact of life that if she wins a second term in November, she\u2019s a somebody in presidential wannabe politics; if she loses, she\u2019s at best a once-was somebody from a small state.\n\nMrs. Fallin, like some other political stars from her state, is not loath to criticize her own party for what she sees as its shortcomings.\n\nSome \u2014 not her, she insists \u2014 focus on the fact that no Oklahoman, let alone an Oklahoma woman, has ever occupied the Oval Office.\n\nHer champions say the GOP could use a female presidential nominee with a demonstrably serious record of fiscal accomplishment.\n\nThat base, Mrs. Fallin said, hasn\u2019t seen the budget and national-debt reductions promised by many Republicans who land on the banks of the Potomac.\n\n\u201cToo many in my party haven\u2019t kept their word on cutting spending, the national debt and government meddling when they got to Washington, including Republican presidents,\u201d she told The Washington Times.\n\nShe\u2019s taken what observers call a conservative \u2014 the political right calls it \u201ccommon sense\u201d \u2014 line on a number of issues. She earned criticism from Democrats and liberals for shunning federal funding to expand Medicaid in Oklahoma under Obamacare. She argued the extension would have cost as much as $1 billion to extend coverage to uninsured Oklahomans through 2020. Maintaining roads and schools and other state priorities would suffer, she said.\n\nCritics called her arithmetic misleading and ideologically driven.\n\nIn June, she approved replacement of the Common Core State Standards in mathematics and English with Oklahoma-written standards.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, federal overreach has tainted Common Core,\u201d she said. \u201cPresident Obama and Washington bureaucrats have usurped Common Core in an attempt to influence state education standards. The results are predictable. What should have been a bipartisan policy is now widely regarded as the president\u2019s plan to establish federal control of curricula, testing and teaching strategies.\u201d\n\nEarlier, she had approved rules that the Republican legislature passed for an A-to-F grading of public schools. The purpose, she said, was to give parents a more easily understandable measure of each public school\u2019s performance than the numeric grading system. Her critics called the A-to-F system unfair and misleading. She prevailed.\n\nShe is only the fourth Republican governor in Oklahoma history, which she says has her pinching herself every now and then when she thinks back to having grown up in a town of 2,000 people and to her parents as struggling to make ends meet as local government employees.\n\nShe also has more than a modicum of determination in her genes.\n\n\u201cMy dad was mayor of our hometown and died at 57, so my mom became mayor,\u201d she said.\n\nAfter college, she became district manager of the national Lexington hotel chain out of Texas. She figures that experience allowed her to know more than a little something about hiring, firing, finding talent, managing it; in other words, all the things voters look for in a chief executive.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Oklahoma so far on Gov.
