But he won\u2019t be there long.\n\nAfter Cowley helped lead the Pioneers to a 3-0 victory over Rensselaer, he will go to the bench on Saturday.\n\nDU coach Jim Montgomery said he will play 21-year-old freshman Tanner Jaillet in net on Saturday for Game 2 against RPI.\n\nThe Pioneers will likely play the first half of their season with a goalie platoon. Or a goalie battle. Depending on your outlook. Here\u2019s a closer look the Cowley and Jaillet two-step in goal for DU.\n\nHere\u2019s your full DU-RPI game recap.\n\nDENVER POST THREE STARS\n\n1. Quentin Shore, Denver \u2014 Shore\u2019s game-winner, a pretty wrist-shot from the right side that clanged in off the post, finally broke DU through in the second period. He also added an assist on the Pios\u2019 second goal.\n\n2. Jason Kasdorf, Rensselaer \u2014 The Engineers\u2019 goalie was outstanding early on. He stopped 20 shots in the first 20 minutes. And he finished with 39 saves.\n\n3. Zac Larraza, Denver \u2014 Larraza was everywhere, assisting on Shore\u2019s goal and re-directing a Nolan Zajac shot in for DU\u2019s second.\n\nWHAT ELSE?\n\n** DU\u2019s Grant Arnold and RPI\u2019s Mike Prapavessis scrumbled in the corner in the first period and the bumping busted open the glass at Magness Arena. Well, it took the plexi out of its frame anyway. The ice crew popped it back in on the quick.\n\n** Montgomery said he agreed with the referee\u2019s calling off Adam Plant\u2019s seeming goal in the first period. On the play, DU\u2019s Matt Marcinew threw a shot at Kasdorf and Plant hooked in a rebound in a scrum. But officials determined Plant was in the crease, even though it seemed he was pushed in by RPI.\n\nMontgomery, after watching the replay, said it looked more like a defender pushed Plant off balance, and he fell into the crease. College refs have been asked this season to keep a closer eye on goalie interference.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Evan Cowley,Hockey,Jason Kasdorf,Jim Montgomery,Nolan Zajac,Pioneers,Quentin Shore,Rensselaer,Tanner Jaillet,Zac Larraza", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "The Field House", "description": "v", "title": "Denver Pioneers' goalie platoon kicks off with Evan Cowley and win over RPI", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/colleges/2014/10/17/denver-pioneers-goalie-platoon-kicks-evan-cowley-win-rpi/31948/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/colleges/files/2014/10/nolan-zajac-du-pioneers-hkc.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "v", "title": "Denver Pioneers\u2019 goalie platoon kicks off with Evan Cowley and win over RPI", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/colleges/2014/10/17/denver-pioneers-goalie-platoon-kicks-evan-cowley-win-rpi/31948/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/colleges/files/2014/10/nolan-zajac-du-pioneers-hkc.jpg", "creator": "@nickgroke", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Denver Pioneers opened their season with sophomore Evan Cowley in net Friday at Magness Arena.
