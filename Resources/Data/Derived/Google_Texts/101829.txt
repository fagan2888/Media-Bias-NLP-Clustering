Many came out to the Bay County Fairgrounds this weekend for the Bay Coastal Living Fair.

Dozens of local vendors were showing off and selling their crafts and handiwork. Vendors were selling homemade soaps, jewelry and even water fountains.

Donations were accepted at the event and proceeds will go to benefit the Anchorage Children's Home. Representatives from the organization say they hope to raise about $500.

"The support in the community has been great," explained Wanda Hicks, the owner of Estate Treasures and Coastal Cottage. "I've seen so many people here that I haven't seen in a long time and it's been a great event we've thoroughly enjoyed doing it."

Organizers of the Coastal Living Fair say the event was such a success, they plan on expanding next year.
