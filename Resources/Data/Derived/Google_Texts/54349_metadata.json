Hodges.\n\n\u201cMore protections are needed,\u201d Brooks said. However, instead of suggesting the Court be abolished, as some like Bobby Jindal (R-LA) have, he turned to democracy as the answer to conservatives frustrations.\n\nBrooks said he believes \u201cIt\u2019s up to the American people\u201d to protect traditional morality through elections. \u201cElements of the Democratic Party have been very successful at putting in place judges that don\u2019t carry respect for First Amendment freedoms,\u201d he said. \u201cConservatives have not done what it takes.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt all comes down to American citizens participation in the political process to ensure that traditional moral values are protected.\u201d Brooks encouraged conservative voters, who he says are justifiably occupied by their careers, families and faith, to speak up and turn out now more than ever. \u201cIf there were enough of us, we could remove any federal judge we want,\u201d he said, noting that with a strong Congressional Republican majority, conservatives could constitutionally remove activist judges from the bench.\n\n\u201cThere are a number of them I would vote out given the opportunity,\u201d Brooks said, referring specifically to Supreme Court Justices. \u201cI\u2019d put the number closer to four or five.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you have justices that can read the plain letter of the law\u2026 and openly rewrite laws,\u201d he said referencing the courts\u2019 holding in King v. Burwell that allowed Federal Obamacare subsidies in the states to stand, \u201cThey have gone beyond the powers of the constitution.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have the votes in the house and senate\u201d to impeach and remove these judges he said, but emphasized the importance of turnout in the next election to get a more conservative Congress and White House.\n\nYellowhammer Radio airs daily in central and north Alabama from 11 a.m.-1 p.m. on Superstation 101.1 WYDE and can be streamed online or through the TuneIn app. Listen to the entire interview with Congressman Brooks in the audio clip below.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "In an interview with Yellowhammer Radio's Cliff Sims, Rep.
