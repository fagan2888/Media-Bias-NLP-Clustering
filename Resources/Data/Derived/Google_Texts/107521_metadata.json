Sean Duffy, R-Wis.; Randy Neugebauer, R-Mo.; and Blaine Luetkemeyer, R-Mo., said in a statement.\n\n>>> Related: Major Bank Won\u2019t Do Business With Florida Gun and Pawn Shop. Is Choke Point to Blame?\n\nOperation Choke Point was designed by the Justice Department in 2012 as a way to combat consumer fraud by working with multiple government agencies\u2014among them the FDIC\u2014to discourage banks from doing business with \u201chigh-risk\u201d industries.\n\nSince its inception, Republicans in Congress voiced concern that the program is being used to drive industries that are politically unpopular out of business.\n\nAmong the businesses allegedly targeted by a \u201chigh risk list\u201d created by the FDIC are payday lenders, firearms sellers, and coin dealers.\n\nThat list, the investigators found, \u201ccreated a perception among some bank executives that we spoke with that the FDIC discouraged institutions from conducting business with those merchants.\u201d\n\n>>> Related: Bank Admits to Choking Off 3 Legal Industries at Government Behest\n\nOverall, investigators consider the FDIC\u2019s involvement in Operation Choke Point \u201cinconsequential to the overall direction and outcome of the imitative\u201d and found \u201cno evidence\u201d that the FDIC used that high risk risk list to target certain industries they don\u2019t like. However, the inspector general found multiple instances of agency employees using \u201cmoral suasion with financial institutions,\u201d which goes against FDIC policies.\n\nThe FDIC does not have a formal definition of moral suasion, but based on the agency\u2019s manuals, it consists of examiners persuading financial institutions to correct a high-risk issue \u201cwithout imposing an informal or formal enforcement action.\u201d\n\nIn order to address these issues, investigators issued three recommendations:\n\nreview and clarify, as appropriate, existing policy and guidance pertaining to the provision and termination of banking services; assess the effectiveness of the FDIC\u2019s supervisory policy and approach after a reasonable period of time is allowed for implementation; and coordinate the FDIC\u2019s Legal Division to review and clarify, as appropriate, supervisory policy and guidance to ensure that moral suasion is adequately addressed.\n\nThe FDIC formally agreed to those recommendations and expects to complete all actions to address the recommendations by Sept. 30, 2016. The agency also says it has already begun implementing some of these recommendations.\n\n>>> Related: Republicans Demand Federal Agencies \u2018Publicly Disclaim\u2019 Their Involvement in Operation Choke Point\n\n\u201cWe are pleased to see a prescriptive timeline under which the FDIC will hold themselves responsible for correcting the policy and personnel issues contributing to the unjust treatment of these lawful businesses,\u201d said Duffy, Neugebauer, and Luetkemeyer, all members of the House Financial Services Committee, said in response to the report\u2019s recommendations.\n\n\u201cThe American people, and the targets of the FDIC\u2019s misguided policies, can be assured that Congress will continue to exercise our oversight authority to ensure that a few top-level bureaucrats \u2018regulation by intimidation\u2019 practices will not continue.\u201d\n\nThe FDIC is the primary government agency responsible for regulating and auditing more than 4,500 U.S. banks.\n\nIn order to conduct its research, the office of the inspector general interviewed and reviewed documents from 23 financial institutions represented across six different regional FDIC offices.
