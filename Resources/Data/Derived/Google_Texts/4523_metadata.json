She also raises cattle. (Submitted photo)\n\nThis special event is something designed to expose Hudson students, especially young girls (K-12) to future opportunities in STEM+ careers in science, technology, engineering, math and the applied arts.\n\nThe event will be held Feb. 12, from 5-8 p.m. at Hudson Middle School. Students will have the opportunity to explore STEM+ careers by meeting and talking with female professionals and others in a variety of fields. Businesses will have booths to showcase what they do and the careers that make up their business. There will also be several local representatives from Minnesota and Wisconsin universities and colleges to talk about their programs.\n\nAmanda Huppert-Sazama will be at the event. She is an application engineer at GEA Process Engineering Inc. in Hudson. She has Bachelor of Science in Food Science and Technology and a Master of Science in Agricultural Education, both from the UW-River Falls.\n\nHuppert-Sazama grew up on a dairy farm near River Falls and she says her upbringing influenced her career choices. \u201cAs a child my backyard was my laboratory as I was always fascinated by how plants grew, how to raise happy and healthy animals and the mechanics of the equipment on the farm.\u201d\n\nThrough programs like 4-H and FFA, she continued to explore careers in the agricultural sciences as well as develop leadership through coursework and competitions. Her experiences in these organizations lead to awareness of opportunities in the agricultural industry and to a career in food science.\n\nHuppert-Sazama said food science encompasses several disciplines including life/agricultural sciences, chemistry, physics, microbiology, mathematics/statistics and engineering and there are a variety of career paths out there.\n\nHer own career has involved research and development for an ingredient manufacturer and for a large food company prior. At GEA she works on dairy processing projects.\n\nHuppert-Sazama has some advice for young women interest in careers like hers. She remembers job shadowing a veterinarian when she was in the eighth grade. \u201cI would recommend exploring career options in areas of interest at an early age, which may also assist in deciding what courses to take in high school.\n\nShe also believes a mentor is a good idea. \u201cMeeting in person or via Skype with a professional in your area of interest on occasion can prove to be very helpful. Mentors can offer guidance on courses to enroll in and schools to apply too. Even adults meet with mentors and it is beneficial to draw from other\u2019s career experiences.\u201d\n\nAnd she recommends being active in the community by participating in youth organizations or volunteer activities. \u201cYou never know who you may meet and the valuable resources that exist in your community! This is a good step toward developing networking skills.\u201d\n\nShe also has some advice for parents looking to guide their daughters. It starts with engaging in a child\u2019s interests and hobbies. \u201cMy mother spent countless hours with me at the library helping me research my interests from dinosaurs to dairy cows. She was also very supportive of my science experiments and projects and also accepting of the messes that came along with scientific inquiry.\u201d\n\nThe event is open to interested students from surrounding schools as well as Hudson.\n\nFor more information about Women in STEM+ contact Melisa Hansen, School to Career Coordinator for the Hudson School District at (715) 377-3712, hansenma@hudson.k12.wi.us or Jodie Bray, Technology and Engineering Instructor, Hudson Middle School at (517) 449-8732, brayjf@hudson.k12.wi.us.\n\nGet hands on at \"Women in STEM+\" set for 5-8 p.m. Feb. 12, at Hudson Middle School\n\nHere are some of the activities planned for students:\n\n\u2014swab and test their own mouth bacteria\n\n\u2014create an object on a 3D printer\n\n\u2014create their own pot on the potter\u2019s wheel\n\n\u2014use an injection molder\n\n\u2014create an app for their phone or iPad\n\n\u2014learn how roads and bridges are built\n\n\u2014learn the science behind every day products they use", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "News,region,news,Education,Hudson,River Falls,Agriculture", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Pat Hunter", "og": {"site_name": "River Falls Journal", "description": "This special event is something designed to expose Hudson students, especially young girls (K-12) to future opportunities in STEM+ careers in science, technology, engineering, math and the applied arts.\r\n\r\nThe event will be held Feb. 12, from 5-8 p.m. at Hudson Middle School.
