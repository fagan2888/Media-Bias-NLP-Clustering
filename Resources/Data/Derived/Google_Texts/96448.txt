U.S. Rep. Trey Gowdy hopes voters remain riled up over the botched Obamacare rollout when the midterm elections roll around in November 2014."It's the tyranny of low expectations," Gowdy, R-S.C., said Wednesday on Fox News Channel's "On the Record with Greta Van Susteren." He said he hopes people don't have such low expectations that they're happy when the website is finally working."I hope they still punish people because it wasn't working when it was supposed to be," Gowdy said.A member of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Gowdy said part of the blame for the fact that no one has been held accountable for the Obamacare fiasco lies with Congress itself."We have investigations and then we'll move on," Gowdy said. "We'll go from NSA to GSA to IRS to Fast and Furious. And we probably should follow up better."Gowdy would like to see Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius lose her job."Maybe we can start slowly building something that's even harder to repair than a website, which is trust," he said.House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., also appeared on the show, telling Van Susteren that the president's new Obamacare public-relations campaign isn't completely truthful.Obama said Republicans have criticized the law but haven't offered alternatives. Cantor said that's not so."I have talked to the president, and, again, I don't have a great opportunity to do so because the president really doesn't engage on Capitol Hill," Cantor said.But, he said, "It's not that way with all those in the White House. In fact, I've had a great relationship with the vice president, am able to bounce ideas off of him."Obama is fully aware of GOP healthcare plans, Gowdy said."The president knows we have that plan. So, it is a little bit baffling to hear the president say what he said."
