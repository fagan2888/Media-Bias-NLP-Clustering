The numbers were published in \u201cBeyond ABC: Assessing Children\u2019s Health in Dallas County,\u201d an annual series providing current and historical data about the health and quality of life for children in the region. Last year\u2019s edition concentrated on the five northern counties adjacent to Dallas \u2014 Collin, Cooke, Denton, Fannin and Grayson \u2014 while the new edition focuses exclusively on children in Dallas County.\n\nThe study addresses the health, education, economic security, and safety of the region\u2019s children, creating a holistic look at the average child\u2019s life and well-being. The common thread among many of Dallas County\u2019s least-healthy children? Poverty.\n\n\u201cPoverty is the common factor in substandard academic achievement, exposure to crime, domestic abuse and illness, and poor health resulting from lack of access to preventive healthcare,\u201d said Children\u2019s Medical Center president and CEO Christopher Durovich. \u201cWe cannot allow the cascading effect of poverty to compromise the health and well-being of such large numbers of children\u2014the next generation of Americans and our future workforce. If we shortchange these children now, the community will pay the price for it later.\u201d\n\nThe decline in uninsured rates for children coincides with an increase in enrollment in CHIP and children\u2019s Medicaid, which resulted from outreach programs funded through the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act. Similar outreach and education programs can be expected with the continuing implementation of the Affordable Care Act. While the uninsured rate is staggering, the amount of children living below the poverty line\u2014an already-low $23,550 or less, per year, for a family of four\u2014was even more disheartening. According to the study, 29.5 percent of Dallas County children lived below the poverty line, a number virtually unchanged since 2010.\n\nThere is some promising news, too, Durovich reminded. More Dallas County children than ever are on Medicaid, and the percentage of uninsured children has dropped by almost 3 percent since 2011. There is a slow improvement in the percentage of two-year-olds who are fully immunized as well, and overall child mortality declined by 50 pediatric deaths since 2011.\n\nThe study wasn\u2019t just an academic exercise, it was a chance to outline goals and actions. At a symposium Tuesday, Children\u2019s officials laid out the following goals:\n\n\u2013 Raise the immunization rate for Dallas County children to no less than 90 percent.\n\n\u2013 Promote the establishment of more medical homes and neighborhood clinics.\n\n\u2013 Encourage more widespread assessment of young children with special needs.\n\n\u2013 Establish partnerships between schools and businesses.\n\n\u2013 Increase the county\u2019s stock of safe, affordable housing units.\n\n\u2013 Encourage dual-generation early childhood education.\n\n\u2013 Expand school meal programs.\n\n\u2013 Increase awareness of the need for more foster homes.\n\n\u2013 Increase the number of specialty courts handling juvenile justice cases.\n\n\u201cAs Dallas County children go, so goes Texas, and as Texas children go, so goes the United States,\u201d said Children\u2019s senior VP Regina Montoya. \u201cIf we love Texas, we also need to love Texas children, as if each one of them was our own.\u201d\n\nRead the full report below:\n\nBABC 2013 FINAL", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "D Healthcare Daily", "description": "More than 13 percent of all Dallas County children are currently without any form of health insurance, a rate nearly double that of the country as a whole, but still a slight improvement over 2011 numbers,\u00a0according to a report released Tuesday by Children\u2019s Medical Center Dallas.
