When eligible, districts have to offer coverage for the same span of time as the look-back period.\n\n\u201cEvery district is going to have to deal with some portion of it this year,\u201d Ammerman said.\n\nThe challenge districts face is tracking people who work multiple jobs in multiple buildings, Ammerman said.\n\n\u201cThere's a significant penalty if school districts do not offer coverage to employees who should be offered coverage,\u201d he said.\n\nKiski Area last school year started manually tracking, and limiting, how many hours substitute teachers work, Business Manager Peggy Gillespie said. The district will now use a computer program to do that work.\n\nOnce a day-to-day sub reaches a weekly limit, 27 to 28 hours, they won't be able to substitute, Gillespie said.\n\nThe requirement has essentially ended the practice of \u201cbuilding subs,\u201d people who could be relied on to come in every day and work where and as needed, Gillespie said.\n\n\u201cWe have to be cognizant of that 30-hour timeframe,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can't afford to provide individual health care for 100 substitutes. We couldn't bear those costs.\u201d\n\n3-day-a-week limit\n\nApollo-Ridge will be limiting subs to working three days per week so none rises to full-time status, which Business Manager Jennie Ivory said is \u201ca shame.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe biggest impact is to our substitute individuals, and we certainly have some wonderful substitutes,\u201d she said. \u201cIt seems a shame. It seems as through they're being penalized. That's not the district's intent, of course. We have to stay within the guidelines of the Affordable Care Act in order not to incur penalties or have to provide benefits.\u201d\n\nOutsourcing substitutes can relieve districts of both the task of tracking hours and offering insurance.\n\nIt was a factor in the South Butler School District's move to use a staffing service for subs starting with the coming school year, district spokesman Jason Davidek said.\n\nUsing the service gives the district an expanded pool of subs \u2014 teachers, custodians and others \u2014 to draw from who have the needed clearances to work in schools, he said.\n\nThe health care requirement is factoring into the Plum School Board's ongoing discussions over whether to continue using the same staffing service or taking management of subs back in-house.\n\nAlthough the district's 2014-15 budget called for eliminating use of a staffing service, some board members want to learn more about the impact of the insurance requirement before formally ending the arrangement. The board has not reached a decision.\n\nKiski: Not much savings\n\nGillespie said Kiski Area looked at outsourcing, but decided against it after not finding much savings.\n\n\u201cWe just weren't ready to move in that direction,\u201d Superintendent John Meighan said.\n\nBecause most substitute teachers work in more than one school district, they may not work enough hours at any one district to qualify for health insurance, said Jan Klein, business director in the Mt. Lebanon School District and chair of the Allegheny County Schools Health Care Consortium.\n\nSubs may not need their own policies, as they may be covered by spouses or be recent graduates still covered under their parents' policies.\n\nBut for those few who do, Klein said districts may opt to risk paying a penalty rather than pay for health insurance.\n\nIt's what she recommended for her district, and what the Mt. Lebanon School Board has decided to do \u2014 the district will offer, but not pay for, health insurance for the few subs who work enough hours to qualify for it.\n\nThat's because it could cost districts less to pay a penalty to the federal government than pay for health insurance, according to Klein.\n\nAt Mt. Lebanon, the cheapest insurance for a single person would cost the district $365 per month. Under the Affordable Care Act \u2013 commonly referred to as Obamacare \u2013 the penalty is $250.\n\n\u201cIt doesn't pay for us to offer health care,\u201d she said. But, \u201cevery school district is going to make a different decision.\u201d\n\nPenalty uncertain\n\nEven then, a penalty is not a sure thing. A district would be penalized only if the employee goes to the federal website and gets a subsidy to get coverage.\n\n\u201cThat's not a bad choice. The person still has health care and it's less expensive for us. It's an option,\u201d Klein said. \u201cWe can pay for it by paying a subsidy through the government or directly out of our pocket. Directly out of our pocket costs more money.\n\n\u201cThe federal government has this system, we're going to use it. That's how the law was set up.\u201d\n\nThe challenge isn't entirely financial, as districts must consider educational impacts as well, especially if limiting substitute teacher hours results in changing them more frequently in classrooms.\n\n\u201cA familiarity and continuity with substitute teachers who are quality teachers is important for the students,\u201d Allegheny Valley Superintendent Cheryl Griffith said.\n\nGriffith said administrators in her district are still working to figure out how they'll comply.\n\n\u201cThere's a balance that has to be considered,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to do the right thing by the students.\u201d\n\nWhile Kiski Area will be trying to limit substitute teacher hours, there will be times that won't be possible, when a certain teacher with a certain certification is needed for a class, Gillespie said.\n\n\u201cWe're always going to do what's best for a classroom. We can't sacrifice the quality of the education,\u201d she said. \u201cThere will be some hard choices having to be made.\u201d\n\nBrian C. Rittmeyer is a staff writer for Trib Total Media.
