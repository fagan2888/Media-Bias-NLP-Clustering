I\u2019m sure he meant to say: \u201ccreate MORE, bitter, partisan arguments.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s at stake is the thin veneer of civility-- perhaps the last civility left in our Republic-- that allows consensus to built even in tough times. It means that while a majority in the Senate rules, it also reigns.\n\nConsensus is dead! Long live the tyrannies of the Majority... with nukes!\n\nMake no mistake: This is just an attempt by Obama to poke the hornets\u2019 nest because the sting of Obamacare is killing him.\n\nNothing constructive will come out of it.\n\nIt\u2019s civil war, senatorial style\u2026 with nukes.\n\nWhile the rest of us worried about Iran going nuclear, Obama went nuclear instead.\n\nHis nuclear ambitions are the surest sign that the Dear Leader is losing his grip on his people.\n\nObama likely meant for Senatorial Civil War. He\u2019s hoping for a shutdown or a showdown that will help him wiggle, waggle and worm his way out of the Obamacare debacle.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the big giveaway: Obama invoked our Founders in defense of Reid\u2019s maneuver in getting rid of the \u201cobstructionists\u201d in the GOP who sought to build a consensus as an alternative to one party rule.\n\n\u201cBut today's pattern of obstruction,\u201d said Obama about the rules that require 60 votes to move a presidential appointment forward, \u201cit just isn't normal. It's not what our founders envisioned,\u201d\n\nYeah, like, when has he ever cared for what our Founders envisioned?\n\nThe last dead white guy he ever had a kind word for was Nancy Pelosi. Or maybe Joe Biden.\n\nSigh\u2026 it\u2019s always the WRONG dead white guys with that dude.\n\n\"If the Democrats proceed to use the nuclear option in this way, it will be Obamacare II: It will be another raw exercise of partisan political power to say we can do whatever we want to do,\" said Republican Senator Lamar Alexander as reported by WBIR in Knoxville, Tennessee. \"The only cure for that is a referendum next November.\"\n\nAnd then let the cleanup of the man-caused fallout and real toxic waste begin.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Nuclear Ambitions Are Clear Sign Dear Leader Obama Losing Grip - John Ransom - Personal Finance, Financial Advice, Money, Business News, Real Estate, Mortgages, Investments, Stocks, Ransom Notes Radio, John Ransom", "og": {"site_name": "finance.townhall.com", "description": "While the rest of us worried about Iran going nuclear, Obama went nuclear instead.
