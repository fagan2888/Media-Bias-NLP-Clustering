DETROIT (WWJ) – Detroit’s biggest health system kicks off a new campaign to help people get signed up for Obamacare.

It’s called “Path to Health” and it’s an outreach effort aimed at more than one hundred thousand people in Detroit and the surrounding area who are uninsured and maybe confused about the enrollment process.

Detroit’s new mayor, Mike Duggan — who happens to be the former CEO of the Detroit Medical Center — says you can’t talk about the city’s recovery without making healthcare a part of the conversation.

“Detroiters are suffering diseases like diabetes and heart disease and pulmonary disease three or four times the rate of those in the suburbs,” Duggan said. “And part of it is personal habits, but much of it is the face that too many people in this community can’t go see a doctor.”

Metro Detroiters who want to learn more about the Affordable Care Act and Michigan’s Medicaid expansion can attend some upcoming Path to Health enrollment events starting Feb. 15.
