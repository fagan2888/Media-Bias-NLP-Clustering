Eagle rescued in Hay Creek

Barb and Craig Rutschow initially thought they had an ill golden eagle on their hands, but the raptor is actually a 3-year-old bald eagle.

While out for a walk near their Hay Creek home Tuesday morning, Barb and Craig Rutschow came across an eagle hopping on the ground. As Barb held back the couple’s two dogs, Craig approached the bird to investigate.

“I was a little reluctant myself,” Barb said, well aware of how dangerous it can be to handle an eagle without the right gear. Thankfully, Craig was bundled up for the walk and wearing a pair of leather gloves.

The eagle began to hiss as Craig got near, but he managed to get ahold of its feet and wrap its wings in a vest.

The Rutschows, both lifelong birders, brought the eagle to their home and put it in a box in the dark — something Barb said they learned to calm birds they’ve raised.

They called the University of Minnesota Raptor Center and a volunteer arrived a couple hours later to take the bird for treatment.

Staff told the Rutschows Thursday that it is a female bald eagle around 3 years old suffering from a high amount of lead in its system. The likely cause is eating prey that was wounded by buckshot pellets.

When it’s ready, the eagle will be released back to Hay Creek.

“This was a wonderful experience for us because everything went right,” Barb said. She recommends people visit the Raptor Center website, www.raptor.cvm.umn.edu, to learn what to do if they encounter an injured bird.
