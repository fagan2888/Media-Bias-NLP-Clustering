Customers\u2019 bills show a fee labeled \u201cACA,\u201d which stands for the Affordable Care Act that will require all businesses with 50 or more full-time workers to provide health coverage or pay a fine. For restaurants with more than 100 full-time staff members, the deadline to comply is 2015. (Businesses with 50 to 100 employees have until 2016.)\n\nLos Angeles restaurant Republique, which opened last year on La Brea Avenue, instituted a 3% healthcare surcharge, stirring controversy among some diners and landing owners Bill Chait and Walter Manzke in the public eye. The pair recently appeared on Fox News\u2019 \u201cThe O\u2019Reilly Factor\u201d to defend the surcharge. \u201cThe genesis of this was really a way to give something to the kitchen to show appreciation for their services,\u201d Chait said, because tips can be distributed only to servers, but all employees can benefit from the healthcare surcharge.\n\nAt Gator\u2019s Dockside, a sign on the front door and a plastic-coated letter handed to diners along with the menu explain the fee. The AP quoted from the letter: \"The costs associated with ACA compliance could ultimately close our doors.\"\n\n\"Therefore,\" the notice said, \"instead of raising prices on our products to generate the additional revenue needed to cover the cost of ACA compliance, Gator's Dockside has implemented a 1% surcharge on all food and beverage purchases only.\"\n\n\"We didn't do this for any, any, any, any, any political reasons,\" a company official who asked not to be named told the AP. \"It was done in all the greatest intentions. It was done to give everybody full healthcare without knocking their hours down and not charging ridiculous amounts of money to do it.\"\n\nChait has said that Republique\u2019s 3% surcharge has nothing to do with Obamacare. But many restaurants, which historically operate with thin profit margins, will have to address the issue of the healthcare mandate.\n\nThe AP story noted that a $14.56 lunch tab for Asian salad and iced tea at Gator\u2019s Dockside in Clermont, Fla., included a 13-cent ACA surcharge.\n\nDiners\u2019 reactions to the Gator\u2019s Dockside surcharge was mixed, with one customer saying, \u201cPeople gotta do what they gotta do to obey the law,\u201d the AP quoted. Others said they would tip less.\n\nALSO:\n\nRepublique owners defend 3% surcharge\n\nSoup's on: Jonathan Gold's 7 picks for rainy-day pho\n\nAt Roy Choi's Pot, double-dipping and Boot Knocker hot pot", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Florida restaurant chain adds healthcare surcharge to the tab; will others follow?", "Description": "A chain of restaurants in central and northern Florida have added a 1% surcharge to its customers\u2019 checks to cover healthcare costs for its employees.
