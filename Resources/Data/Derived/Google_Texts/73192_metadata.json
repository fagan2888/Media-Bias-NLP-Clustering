But after Slater won by calling heads, the first words out of his mouth were, \u201cWe want to kick.\u201d That meant the Patriots had to kick the ball away, and the Jets, not New England, got to choose the direction.\n\nConfusing.\n\nThen, even more bafflingly, the Patriots defense barely resisted, allowing Ryan Fitzpatrick and the Jets to go 80 yards in five plays for the winning touchdown.\n\nBelichick had won an overtime game two years ago using the \u201ctake the wind\u201d strategy. He insisted there was no confusion about his plan this time.\n\n\u201cI thought it was the best thing to do,\u201d he said.\n\nBut nothing went the way the coach drew it up.\n\nAnd because of that, the Patriots (12-3) will not get to rest starters next Sunday at Miami. They\u2019ll go into the game needing a win to guarantee themselves the top seed in the AFC.\n\nIn case you missed it, here are the other hot topics after the second-to-last week of the NFL season:\n\nNOT UNDEFEATED: Instead of thinking about a perfect season, the Carolina Panthers now have to worry about locking down the best record in the NFC. The Panthers fell 20-13 to the Atlanta Falcons for their first loss in 15 games this season \u2014 and their first regular-season loss since Nov. 30, 2014. (Side note: Check out Julio Jones of the Falcons with his leaping, go-ahead touchdown catch.) The Carolina loss, combined with Arizona\u2019s 38-8 crushing of the Packers, means that if the Cardinals (13-2) win and Panthers lose next week, Carolina would drop to No. 2 in the conference. Oh, and yes, members of the perfect and still-unmatched 1972 Miami Dolphins finally took their champagne off ice.", "article_metadata": {"description": "ICYMI in NFL\u2019s Week 16: Pats choose to kick in OT and lose", "title": "ICYMI in NFL\u2019s Week 16: Pats choose to kick in OT and lose", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "ICYMI in NFL\u2019s Week 16: Pats choose to kick in OT and lose", "title": "ICYMI in NFL\u2019s Week 16: Pats choose to kick in OT and lose", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/12/28/icymi_in_nfls_week_16_pats_choose_to_kick_in_ot_and_lose/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/patriots-jets-football.jpeg10-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "ICYMI in NFL\u2019s Week 16: Pats choose to kick in OT and lose", "title": "ICYMI in NFL\u2019s Week 16: Pats choose to kick in OT and lose", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/patriots-jets-football.jpeg10-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Eddie Pells", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The Carolina loss, combined with Arizona\u2019s 38-8 crushing of the Packers, means that if the Cardinals (13-2) win and Panthers lose next week, Carolina would drop to No.\nThe team that wins the coin toss actually can choose from three options: kick or receive \u2014 or defend their choice of end zone.\nTopics: From the Wires, Entertainment News, NewsThe Patriots could\u2019ve been resting next Sunday with the AFC\u2019s best record all wrapped up.\nEven though it was warm and not all that windy, Belichick instructed Slater to choose to defend the north end zone if the Patriots won the toss, meaning New York would almost certainly then choose to receive the kickoff.\nBelichick had won an overtime game two years ago using the \u201ctake the wind\u201d strategy."}
