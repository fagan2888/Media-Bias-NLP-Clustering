Former Vice President Dick Cheney attended two fundraisers in Denver today, one for his daughter, Liz, a U.S. Senate candidate in Wyoming and one for the state GOP, where plenty of Republicans were excited about recent polling numbers for Democrats John Hickenlooper and Mark Udall.

The events were closed to the media so there was no chance to ask the ex veep and his daughter about their family’s very public rift on gay marriage.

Those who attended said Cheney talked about a variety issues, including foreign policy, Obamacare and life in the White House.

The state GOP fundraiser at the Denver Athletic Club attracted a number of candidates, including U.S. Senate contenders Randy Baumgardner and Amy Stephens, state lawmakers hoping to win the GOP nomination next June and knock off Udall in November. Gubernatorial candidates included former state Sen. Mike Kopp and current Sen. Greg Brophy, looking to unseat Gov. Hickenlooper next year.

Although it’s early, Republicans are excited about two Quinnipiac University polls released this week that show the Democratic incumbents don’t have sizeable leads over their GOP challengers.
