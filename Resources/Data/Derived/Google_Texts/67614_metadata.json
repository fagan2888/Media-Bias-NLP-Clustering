Tom Kuntz is one of nine members on a panel investigating hospital finances.\n\nThe other people named to the panel, which is aimed at making recommendations for a special legislative session scheduled to begin June 1, are Carlos Beruff, president of Medallion homes, who will be the chairman; retired Brig. Gen. Chip Diehl; attorney Marili Cancio Johnson; former Gadsden County Commissioner Eugene Lamb Jr.; Jason Rosenburg, a physician and former chairman of the Florida Board of Medicine; Ken Smith, owner of Integrated Beef Consultants; former Destin Mayor Sam Seevers; and Robert Spottswood, president and director of Spottswood Companies, which has interests that include real estate and hospitality.\n\nThe hospital commission is asking hospitals for proposals, including a possible profit-sharing plan. Florida state Sen. Alan Hays, R-Umatilla, said all ideas need to be vetted.\n\n\u201cAs I told the governor when he asked me about it, I said 'Governor, at this stage, I think the people of Florida deserve consideration of any and all ideas,'\u201d Hays said. \u201cAnd the profit sharing idea is certainly one that\u2019s worked in other industries.\u201d\n\nThe governor put the commission together after lawmakers failed to agree on whether to expand Medicaid. Expansion has been tied to federal funding to hospitals, with some hospitals saying they would need to cut service without the funding.\n\nHays is pessimistic that the Florida Senate\u2019s Medicaid expansion plan has a future.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really think it does, to tell you the truth,\u201d Hays said. \u201cI think the best way to go about solving these problems is to separate the two.\u201d\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nAbe Aboraya is a reporter with WMFE in Orlando.
