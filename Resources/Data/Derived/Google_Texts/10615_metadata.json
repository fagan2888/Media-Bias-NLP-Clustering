Some patients have chosen to wait for new drugs to avoid the brutal side effects of interferon treatment, the standard hepatitis C therapy for the most common type, genotype 1.\n\nNow a combination of two oral drugs developed by the international pharmaceutical company, Merck & Co, may offer hope to some of those who are patient enough to wait. The combination treatment has a very high cure rate, according to Reuters, curing between 96 and 100 percent of people in a small midstage clinical trial. Several other manufacturers are aiming to create interferon-free therapies for hepatitis C.\n\n\u201cThe designation of [the combination drugs] as a breakthrough therapy for chronic hepatitis C is an important milestone for Merck,\u201d Roger M. Perlmutter, the president of Merck Research Laboratories, said in a statement. \u201cThere remains significant unmet medical need in hepatitis C, and we are looking forward to working with the FDA to advance this program as quickly as we can to bring this investigational combination to [hepatitis C virus] specialists and their patients.\u201d\n\nNearly 4 million Americans are infected with the virus, which is contracted through exposure to blood, like sharing needles. Current standard treatment cures between 66 and 79 percent of patients who have the genotype 1 version of hepatitis C, according to the Food and Drug Administration. The standard therapy involves the injection of a drug called interferon, a treatment that stimulates the immune system and causes a number of side effects, such as hair loss, headaches, and nausea. The second part of the treatment involves taking two antiviral drugs orally.\n\nOther side effects from interferon injections include mental health effects that interfere with sleeping. Depression, anxiety, irritation, and fatigue are also possible side effects from the injection. The United States Department of Veterans Affairs lists several others, ranging from fever and diarrhea to poor appetite and dry mouth. Another problem with interferon tretment is that it slows the body\u2019s production of white blood cells and decreases platelet counts. As an important factor in forming blood clots, low platelet counts could lead to more nosebleeds, bruises, and other bleeding.\n\nThe study that tested the new combination of Merck drugs experimented on 65 patients, testing the protease inhibitor MK-5172 with MK-8742 over 12 weeks. \u201cWe are encouraged by these preliminary data,\u201d Eliav Barr, head of infectious diseases for Merck, told Reuters. \u201cIt\u2019s a one-two punch with both arms equally strong.\u201d\n\nBut even if some hepatitis C patients hope to wait for these seemingly \u201cnew and improved\u201d drugs, doctors state the importance of getting treated immediately for high risk patients. Hepatitis C could possibly induce liver scarring, or cirrhosis, which can lead to liver cancer and even death. \u201cFor many patients who would have a favorable response to treatment now, it doesn\u2019t make sense to me to put their treatment off,\u201d Dr. Mitchell L. Shiffman, a liver specialist at Bon Secours Health System\u2019s Liver Institute of Virgina, told the Wall Street Journal.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "hepatitis c, merck, interferon treatment, cure", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A combination of two oral hepatitis C drugs manufactured by Merck lead to high cure rates and less side effects in a clinical trial, prompting some patients to wait for it to come to market.", "title": "Hepatitis C: Combo Of Merck Drugs May Provide Cure Without Brutal Side Effects", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/hepatitis-c-could-combo-merck-drugs-provide-cure-without-brutal-side-effects-261767", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/11/02/hepatitis-injection.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A combination of two oral hepatitis C drugs manufactured by Merck lead to high cure rates and less side effects in a clinical trial, prompting some patients to wait for it to come to market.", "title": "Hepatitis C: Combo Of Merck Drugs May Provide Cure Without Brutal Side Effects", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/hepatitis-c-could-combo-merck-drugs-provide-cure-without-brutal-side-effects-261767", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/11/02/hepatitis-injection.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/11/02/hepatitis-injection.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Drugs", "published_time": "2013-11-02T14:43:36-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-02T14:43:36-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A combination of two oral hepatitis C drugs manufactured by Merck lead to high cure rates and less side effects in a clinical trial, prompting some patients to wait for it to come to market."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde84e\"", "article_summary": "The combination treatment has a very high cure rate, according to Reuters, curing between 96 and 100 percent of people in a small midstage clinical trial.\nSome patients have chosen to wait for new drugs to avoid the brutal side effects of interferon treatment, the standard hepatitis C therapy for the most common type, genotype 1.\nThe study that tested the new combination of Merck drugs experimented on 65 patients, testing the protease inhibitor MK-5172 with MK-8742 over 12 weeks.\nHepatitis C could possibly induce liver scarring, or cirrhosis, which can lead to liver cancer and even death.\nMany patients infected with the hepatitis C virus are waiting for new drug therapies that will effectively treat or even cure the disease, without all the side effects that current standard treatment forces upon them."}
