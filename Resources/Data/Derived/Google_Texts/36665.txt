Tucson Police are looking for a person who fired a gun into the air on Fourth Avenue shortly after midnight Sunday morning.

Witnesses told police an obviously intoxicated man was walking down the street when he got into an altercation with another person, who fired a shot into the air and then left, said Sgt. Pete Dugan, a TPD spokesman.

The incident took place in the 500 block of North Fourth Avenue near Brooklyn Pizza and Sky Bar, according to witnesses.

The intoxicated man said he didn't want to prosecute, but Dugan said discharging a weapon in city limits is illegal, regardless.

Police still need to get the other side of the story and have been continuing their investigation, Dugan said.

Fourth Avenue is just blocks away from the University of Arizona and is a popular nightlife destination for UA students. In August, a man was shot to death down the street at Maloney's on Fourth Avenue, a bar.

The most recent incident happened in the middle of the UA's annual Family Weekend and just two days after an altercation between students at Northern Arizona University escalated until one student allegedly shot four others, killing one of them.
