NEW YORK (AP) — More tests are needed to determine the cause of death of a Syracuse University sprinter found in a Times Square hotel room during spring break, medical examiners said Sunday.

Sabrina Cammock’s autopsy was conducted Sunday, but the results were awaiting further studies, medical examiners’ spokeswoman Julie Bolcer said.

Police say there were no signs of criminality when Cammock was found at around 9:20 a.m. Saturday at the Hotel Edison. The hotel declined to comment on the death, first reported Saturday by the Daily News.

Specializing in sprinting, Cammock competed as recently as the previous weekend, when she was on the women’s 4×400 relay team at the 2015 ACC Indoor Championships at Virginia Tech, according to Syracuse’s sports website.

“Sabrina was a wonderful and remarkable person and student-athlete,” Syracuse track and field coach Chris Fox said in a statement Saturday. “Our team and coaching staff are devastated by her loss.”
