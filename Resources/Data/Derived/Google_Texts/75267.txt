EDINBURG — Hidalgo County health officials breathed a sigh of relief after the federal government last week extended the state’s 1115 Waiver program that provides hundreds of millions of dollars for health care services throughout the county.

The 1115 Waiver program was approved by the federal government after several states, including Texas, refused to expand Medicaid as part of the Affordable Care Act — also known as Obamacare — five years ago.

The 1115 Waiver program allocated $829 million worth of matched funding over a five-year period to this region, which includes the counties of Hidalgo, Starr, Cameron and Willacy, Hidalgo County Health Director Eddie Olivarez said. Basically, matched funding meant the county had to send the federal government taxpayer money in order to get 100 percent of it back, plus some additional funds.

“We did not qualify for that funding because we didn’t have the tax base for it,” Olivarez said. “So what happened is, there was over $400 million that was left on the table that was not utilized to get federal funding to assist with healthcare in our community.”
