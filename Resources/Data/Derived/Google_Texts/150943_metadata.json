Some cases already have emerged in the United States.\n\nWhile the disease, called chikungun-ya, usually is not fatal, the epidemic has overwhelmed hospitals, cut economic productivity and caused its sufferers days of pain and misery. And the count of victims is soaring.\n\nIn El Salvador, health officials report nearly 30,000 suspected cases, up from 2,300 at the beginning of August. Hospitals are filled with people with the telltale signs of the illness, including joint pain so severe it can be hard to walk.\n\n\u201cThe pain is unbelievable,\u201d said Catalino Castillo, a 39-year-old seeking treatment at a San Salvador hospital. \u201cIt\u2019s been 10 days, and it won\u2019t let up.\u201d\n\nVenezuelan officials reported at least 1,700 cases as of Friday, and the number is expected to rise. Neighboring Colombia has about 4,800 cases, but the health ministry projects there will be nearly 700,000 by early 2015.\n\nBrazil has now recorded its first locally transmitted cases, which are distinct from those involving people who contracted the virus while traveling in an infected area.\n\nHardest hit has been the Dominican Republic, with half the cases reported in the Americas. According to the Pan American Health Organization, chikungunya has spread to at least two dozen countries and territories across the Western Hemisphere since the first case was registered in French St. Martin in late 2013.\n\nThere have been a few locally transmitted cases in the U.S., all in Florida, and it has the potential to spread farther, experts say, but Central and South America are particularly vulnerable.\n\nThe chief factors are the prevalence of the main vector for the virus, the aedes aegypti mosquito, and the lack of immunity in a population that hasn\u2019t been hit with chikungunya in modern medical history, said Scott C. Weaver, director of the Institute for Human Infections and Immunity at the University of Texas Medical Branch.\n\n\u201cThere are going to be some very large populations at risk down there, much larger than the Caribbean,\u201d Weaver said.\n\nThere have been only 113 deaths linked to the region\u2019s outbreak, according to the most recent data, but chikungunya can be crippling.\n\nHerman Slater, a 60-year-old gardener in Jamaica\u2019s capital of Kingston, said he was laid out for almost two weeks this month with unimaginable joint pain, hammer-pounding headaches and fevers that came in waves.\n\n\u201cI tell you, I was surprised by how painful it was. It was taking me five minutes to get out of bed, and then I could hardly even walk,\u201d Slater said. \u201cMy hands were so bad I couldn\u2019t open a bottle, couldn\u2019t comb my hair. Every night I was wet from sweat.\u201d\n\nIn acute cases, pain can last for months. Joanna Rivas, who works as a maid in the Dominican capital of Santo Domingo, said she has had joint pain since May, and her 12-year-old daughter\u2019s case is so severe the girl can\u2019t hold her pen at school. Both have been taking the pain reliever acetaminophen, the main treatment for chikungunya, which has no cure or vaccine.\n\nBesides the suffering, chikungunya has caused economic damage with the cost of providing treatment and controlling mosquitoes and by absenteeism from work.\n\nChikungunya, which has been known for decades in parts of Africa and Asia, is transmitted when a mosquito bites an infected person and then feeds on someone else. It may have found fertile ground in Latin America and the Caribbean because many people are outside in the daytime, when aedes aegypti bite, or lack adequate screens on their windows.\n\nThe virus\n\nChikungunya patients get a severe, arthritis-like ache in the joints, accompanied by a spiking fever and headaches. There is no cure or vaccine. The name of the virus, which is spread by the aedes aegypti mosquito, comes from the Makonde language of Tanzania and translates roughly as \u201cthat which bends up.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Mosquito-borne virus chikungunya infects 1 million in the Americas", "title": "Mosquito-borne virus chikungunya infects 1 million in the Americas", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/27/mosquito-borne-virus-chikungunya-infects-1-million-in-the-americas/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140927__20140928_A2_ND28VIRUSp2.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140927__20140928_A2_ND28VIRUSp2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-27T19:20:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T09:32:14+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Hospitals are filled with people with the telltale signs of the illness, including joint pain so severe it can be hard to walk.\nEvery night I was wet from sweat.\u201dIn acute cases, pain can last for months.\nBrazil has now recorded its first locally transmitted cases, which are distinct from those involving people who contracted the virus while traveling in an infected area.\nBoth have been taking the pain reliever acetaminophen, the main treatment for chikungunya, which has no cure or vaccine.\nHerman Slater, a 60-year-old gardener in Jamaica\u2019s capital of Kingston, said he was laid out for almost two weeks this month with unimaginable joint pain, hammer-pounding headaches and fevers that came in waves."}
