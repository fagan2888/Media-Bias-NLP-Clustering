Landeskog probably will return to the lineup Sunday against the Blues in St. Louis.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a good chance he\u2019ll play (Sunday),\u201d coach Patrick Roy said.\n\nLandeskog, 23, was among a handful of Avalanche players to skate at the Predators\u2019 practice facility Saturday morning.\n\nMikhail Grigorenko again replaced Landeskog at left wing on the Nathan MacKinnon- centered line. Defenseman Zach Redmond was Colorado\u2019s only healthy scratch.\n\nVarly update. Semyon Varla- mov started in goal for the Avalanche at Nashville \u2014 his 226th career start for Colorado, now third-most all time behind Roy (478) and Peter Budaj (242) \u2014 and he might also play Sunday against the Blues.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all going to depend on how many shots and how much work Varly is going to have (Saturday night),\u201d Roy said before the game. \u201cIf he\u2019s not that busy and playing a good game, I might use him (at St. Louis). We\u2019ll talk after the game.\u201d\n\nVersatile venue. Bridgestone Arena hosted its first basketball-hockey doubleheader Saturday, with Middle Tennessee State playing Auburn at noon and the Avs-Preds game at 7.\n\nThe Avs gathered for meetings and off-ice workouts as the basketball game was beginning.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t like not having the option to skate in the morning,\u201d Roy said. \u201cBut it is what it is.\u201d\n\nFootnote. When the Avs wrap up their three-game trip Tuesday at Chicago, they will have been on the road for 27 of the previous 37 games. And they\u2019re on the end of another stretch that has them playing 18-of-25 games outside Denver.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Gabe Landeskog likely back on Sunday", "title": "Gabe Landeskog likely back on Sunday", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/12/12/gabe-landeskog-likely-back-on-sunday/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151212__Gabe-Landeskogp1.jpg", "height": 580}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151212__Gabe-Landeskogp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-12T22:08:44+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T20:47:37+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "NASHVILLE, tenn. \u2014 Back spasms forced Avalanche captain Gabe Landeskog to miss his second consecutive game Saturday.\nLandeskog, 23, was among a handful of Avalanche players to skate at the Predators\u2019 practice facility Saturday morning.\n\u201cIf he\u2019s not that busy and playing a good game, I might use him (at St. Louis).\nLandeskog probably will return to the lineup Sunday against the Blues in St. Louis.\nAnd they\u2019re on the end of another stretch that has them playing 18-of-25 games outside Denver."}
