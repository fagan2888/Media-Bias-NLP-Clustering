More specifically, very few Democrats are running for reelection on the greatness of the ACA or Obamacare.\n\nWhy? Because there\u2019s not much to say. And that\u2019s even though, as insurance expert Robert Laszewski explained this week in USA Today, the administration has become a master at spinning the facts about Obamacare. The administration, for instance, \u201cput a gag rule on insurance companies from talking about just how well the second version of HealthCare.gov is working,\u201d which is probably a sign that it isn\u2019t going as well as they hoped it would. It\u2019s also \u201cdelayed the start of the 2015 open enrollment from last year\u2019s October 1st start date to November 15th this year,\u201d which is conveniently after the elections.\n\nBut that just means we need to docment the side effects of the law. A new Mercatus Center study, \u201cThe Affordable Care Act and the New Economics of Part-Time Work,\u201d by University of Chicago\u2019s Casey Mulligan looks at the law\u2019s damage on labor markets. There are three major ways it discourages work: (1) an explicit tax on full-time work, (2) an implicit tax on full-time work for those who are ineligible for the ACA\u2019s health-insurance subsidies, and (3) an implicit tax that links the amount of available subsidies to workers\u2019 incomes. What\u2019s the sum of these problems?\n\nThe health subsidies\u2019 structure will put millions in a position in which working part-time (29 hours or less, as defined by the ACA) will yield more disposable income than working their normal full-time schedule. This creates a strong incentive to work less. He estimates these ACA disincentives will reduce work by about 3 percent, or about 4 million full-time-equivalent workers. This is the aggregate result of the law\u2019s employment disincentives, and it\u2019s nearly double the impact most recently estimated by the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nNearly half of American workers will be affected by at least one of the ACA\u2019s employment taxes \u2014 and this does not account for the indirect effect on others as the labor market adjusts.\n\nNotably, the ACA will push more women than men into part-time work. Because a greater percent\u00adage of women work just above 30 hours per week, it is women who will be more likely to drop to part-time work as defined by the ACA.\n\nMulligan\u2019s findings are consistent with the work of other economists, such as Nobel laureate Ed Prescott. I explained the connection in the past:\n\n\u201cIn his famous 2004 paper, \u2018Why do Americans work so much more than Europeans?\u2019 [Prescott] shows that workers spend considerably more hours working when marginal tax rates on their incomes are lower. So basically, over time, people will reduce the number of hours of work, economic growth slows down, and less revenue is collected.\u201d In other words, we can expect tax increases to have an impact on the available labor supply. But Prescott\u2019s other big insight is that a generous redistributive system makes it easier to reduce one\u2019s labor supply. As George Mason University economist Garett Jones explains, \u201cPrescott argues that if you raise taxes for pure redistribution from the \u2018average person\u2019 back to the \u2018average person,\u2019 then the tax hike doesn\u2019t make the \u2018average person\u2019 poorer: The government is taking money out of everyone\u2019s right pocket and slipping it into their left. But if the income effect is gone, what\u2019s left? The disincentive to work: The pure substitution effect.\u201d In other words, higher taxes coupled with more generous benefits equal a strong incentive to work less.\n\nThe bottom line: Lawmakers can try to distance themselves from Obamacare, but Americans will feel its deep consequences on the labor market for a long time.
