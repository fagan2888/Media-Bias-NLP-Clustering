They have access to it and that\u2019s stretching doctors\u2019 case loads,\u201d John Jansen the Director of Kenosha County Human Services said.\n\nThe shortage is worse in Kenosha than Wisconsin as a whole, data shows. The ratio of mental health providers to population is 1 to 1,075 in Kenosha. Statewide that ratio is better at 1 to 623.\n\nDr. Vanessa Chang, a psychiatrist with Aurora Behavioral Health Services said the demand has been steady even before the health care law changes.\n\n\u201cThere are not a lot of psychiatrists who want to come down to Kenosha and Racine. The ones that are already here, they\u2019ve been practiceing for decades. They have patient loads built up for decades,\u201d Chang said.\n\nProviders have been trying other methods of stretching resources, including having psychiatrists advise primary care doctors who have patients with mental issues and telepsychiatry, using technology like Skype to video conference with patients.\n\n\u201cThe patients don\u2019t like to talk to someone on the television,\u201d Chang said. \u201cThere is the option and the resource when they can\u2019t get into see someone.\u201d\n\nJansen recently advised the County Board on the shortage and wanted to emphazise that people have options and access to care.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want people to be left with the impression that because of our stretched resources that folks do not have access to care. If you have been identified as someone who needs help, we\u2019re going to get you that help,\u201d Jansen said.\n\nThe County Board has been waiting to act on the shortage pending a study by Human Services, expected later this year. Kenosha County needs other people besides doctors. Over the last 10 months Human Services has been conducting a nationwide recruiting effort for psychiatric nurse practitioners. Allowing allied professions like physician assistants who have psychiatric training to prescibe mental health medications also helps.\n\nSupervisor Anita Johnson wants the county to partner with Gateway Technical College for a fast track certification for people who already have medical training to go into psychiatry and be a resource for the county.\n\nA shortage in psychiatrists was news to Jasmine Zeidan, a senior at Tremper High School who also serves as the youth in governance member for county board. Zeidan had considered a psychology degrees as a dead end.\n\n\u201cI know a lot of people don\u2019t like to major in psychology because they don\u2019t know what to do with it,\u201d Zeidan said. \u201cA lot of high schoolers, that I know, are trying to get a job that is more practical that they know will get them income.\u201d\n\nIn fact, psychiatrists are less likely to accept private insurance, medicaid or any kind of health coverage opting to take private pay, according to Sita Diehl, Director of State Policy and Advocacy the National Alliance on Mental Illness.\n\n\u201cThe reimbursement doesn\u2019t reflect the added time and documentation needed that other doctors don\u2019t have to do,\u201d Diehl said.\n\nFor Kenosha psychiatrist Dr. Ashok Shah, the reimbursement is an issue, but it doesn\u2019t discourage him from from practicing.\n\n\u201cIf you didn\u2019t love it you wouldn\u2019t do it,\u201d Shah said.", "article_metadata": {"robots": "index,follow", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 424648924332198}, "format-detection": "telephone=no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7d06\"", "article_summary": "They have access to it and that\u2019s stretching doctors\u2019 case loads,\u201d John Jansen the Director of Kenosha County Human Services said.\nThe ratio of mental health providers to population is 1 to 1,075 in Kenosha.\nKenosha County needs other people besides doctors.\nFor Kenosha psychiatrist Dr. Ashok Shah, the reimbursement is an issue, but it doesn\u2019t discourage him from from practicing.\nThe shortage is worse in Kenosha than Wisconsin as a whole, data shows."}
