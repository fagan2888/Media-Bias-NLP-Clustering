They want one more Sunday.\n\nA victory over the Dallas Cowboys (8-7) would clinch the NFC East title for the Eagles (9-6) and secure the No. 3 seed in the conference. It\u2019s already been a remarkable turnaround under rookie coach Chip Kelly after a 4-12 finish last year.\n\nSEE ALSO: HARRIS: Cowher, Briles figure to top Redskins\u2019 list\n\nBut this story is far from complete. For all of his accomplishments, Foles is constantly reminded about the first time the Eagles played the Cowboys.\n\nBoth teams were 3-3 when Dallas came to Philadelphia, shut down Kelly\u2019s high-flying offense and knocked Foles out of the game with a concussion at the end of the third quarter. Foles was 11 of 29 for 80 yards in the 17-3 loss, a dismal performance in only his second start after replacing an injured Michael Vick.\n\n\u201cI know everybody is going to dwell on last time, but this game isn\u2019t the last game,\u201d Foles said.\n\nSEE ALSO: Mom is the driving force for Redskins running back Jawan Jamison\n\nFoles returned from the concussion two weeks later and threw seven touchdown passes to tie an NFL record in a victory at Oakland. He leads the league with a passer rating of 118.8, which is third-highest in the history of the NFL. He\u2019s thrown 25 TD passes to only two interceptions. He\u2019s led the Eagles to a 7-2 record in nine starts and has them on the verge of going worst to first in the division.\n\nYet, he\u2019s still asked about that first game against Dallas on Oct. 20. See, beating the Cowboys is an obsession in Philadelphia. It\u2019s almost equivalent to a playoff game every time they face the boys with the stars on their helmet.\n\n\u201cIf I look into every little thing that I did and try to break it down, I\u2019ll drive myself crazy as well,\u201d Foles said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been asked that question several times and everyone wants an answer, but I think the answer is that we had a bad day. We did not play well, but from that game we\u2019ve grown together as a team.\u201d\n\nThe offense has been nearly unstoppable with Foles under center since. Foles is having one of the best seasons in franchise history. The offense has set team records with eight games of 30-plus points and six games of at least 450 total yards. They\u2019re 22 points and 79 yards away from setting club records for most points and most yards.\n\nSo, maybe that loss to Dallas didn\u2019t hurt them too much after all.\n\n\u201cWe use that game as not necessarily fuel, but it was character-building,\u201d Foles said. \u201cTough games like that, tough things in life, you face adversity and it hurts. You don\u2019t feel good. You feel it in your heart; it\u2019s not fun. But you learn how to get better. You overcome obstacles and you grow together as a team, and that\u2019s the beauty of it. We kept rallying and we kept sticking together.\u201d\n\nThere were critics who thought Foles folded under pressure the first time against the Cowboys. Though it was only Week 7, first place was on the line, and he was still trying to prove himself worthy of being the starter.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think whatever the setting is, is too big for Nick,\u201d offensive coordinator Pat Shurmur said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t play very well. I don\u2019t think any of us played well the first time we played Dallas. I looked back on it now and I don\u2019t recognize some of what happened. We dropped balls; we weren\u2019t on the same page with who we blocked. Certainly Nick had some inaccuracies. We did a poor job coaching and playing.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re a different team now.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Both teams were 3-3 when Dallas came to Philadelphia, shut down Chip Kelly's high-flying offense and knocked Foles out of the game with a concussion at the end of the third quarter.
