The Appalachian region has been hit hard by a downturn in the coal industry. (Photo: By Pat McDonogh, The CJ)\n\nPRESTONSBURG, Ky. \u2014 These hardscrabble Appalachian hills so rife with need and illness have been a national testing ground for Obamacare over the past two years and may soon test something more fundamental \u2014 the age-old struggle to balance personal responsibility and the obligation to care for the very poor.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act gave thousands of residents in Eastern Kentucky, one of the nation\u2019s most vulnerable communities, unprecedented new access to health care. It came mostly through the expansion of taxpayer-funded Medicaid, and it helped make Kentucky a national model.\n\nBut it also raised fears about yet another burden on a fragile state budget and skepticism among conservatives who saw it as out of step with their political ideology. Newly elected Republican Gov. Matt Bevin alluded to both concerns when he announced plans to remake Kentucky\u2019s Medicaid expansion to look more like nearby Indiana\u2019s, a more limited version that calls for patients to share more costs so they have a bigger stake in their care. Bevin is already moving forward with plans to dismantle the state\u2019s popular \u201ckynect\u201d health insurance exchange, where residents sign up for both Medicaid and private coverage.\n\nIf the governor succeeds and changes to Medicaid begin next year, Kentucky would join six other states with specially designed Medicaid expansion programs approved by the federal government \u2014 and would be one of the first states to replace the traditional Medicaid expansion envisioned by the ACA with one that includes premiums and higher co-pays.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re obviously watching this very closely,\u201d says Judith Solomon, a vice president at the non-partisan Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, which focuses on poverty and inequality. When it comes to making poor people pay more for their care, \u201cthere are some real serious questions that (federal agencies), the Obama administration and future administrations will have to address,\u201d especially since self-styled Medicaid expansions are part of \u201cthe next wave\u201d in the ACA\u2019s evolution.\n\nHere in Floyd County, where USA TODAY and The (Louisville) Courier-Journal have chronicled the ACA's rollout, Medicaid patients and their doctors fret \u2014 and often disagree \u2014 about what all this change could mean for them.\n\nUnemployed father Zachary Ryan Dye, 19, says \u201cit ain\u2019t possible\u201d for people in his position to pay even a little more for health care, so he\u2019d have to give up the insurance or skip appointments. Things have been so tight lately he\u2019s had to rely on a church food pantry to help with food for him and his 1-year-old.\n\nColon cancer survivor Pamela Hereford, 57, says she could probably pay a few dollars more for Medicaid but worries the poor families she works with as mental health services manager at the local Head Start would have to do without.\n\nPamela Hereford is a survivor of colon cancer and a resident of eastern Kentucky. She currently is on Medicaid through the state's Kynect system. Gov. Matt Bevin has announced he will eliminate the program and is looking at having Medicaid members pay a portion of their coverage.

Some here argue concerns about coal trumped Obamacare and helped lead most of Appalachian Kentucky to vote for Bevin over Democrat Jack Conway \u2014 despite Bevin\u2019s vow to pull back or change Medicaid that had helped so many area residents.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re taking a major hit right now with the loss of coal jobs and all those jobs tied to the coal industry,\u201d Floyd Judge-Executive Ben Hale says. \u201cWe\u2019d hate to have another hardship put on us for the people qualified for Medicaid, who are struggling as it is.\u201d\n\nObstetrician/gynecologist Joanna Santiesteban, medical director at Harper OB/GYN in Prestonsburg, poses with her husband, Brent Graden, general manager of the practice. (Photo: Laura Ungar/USA TODAY)\n\nStates seek more from patients\n\nBevin\u2019s plan would be a new turn in a rollout that has gained national attention.\n\nKentucky became the first Southern state to fully embrace the ACA under Democratic governor Steve Beshear, and more than half a million residents signed up for insurance, including nearly 425,000 for expanded Medicaid covering those earning up to 138% of the poverty level, or about $16,000 for one person. Nearly 5,700 residents got expanded Medicaid in Floyd County, a community of 38,000 that the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation ranks as second worst in Kentucky on health indicators.\n\nFloyd\u2019s uninsured rate was cut in half to less than 8%, estimates show, while the state\u2019s rate dropped from more than 20% to less than 9%.\n\nBut Bevin has said the current Medicaid program, which covers more than a quarter of Kentuckians, is not sustainable. The federal government pays 70% of costs of about 875,000 people in traditional services and by 2020 will pay 90% of costs for those added through the expansion.\n\nHe\u2019s looking to Indiana, which after initially joining other Republican-dominated states in refusing to expand Medicaid, last year won federal approval for a more limited version that requires premiums and co-pays and offers different tiers of coverage.\n\nParticipants are required to make monthly contributions ranging from $1 to $27. Those who don\u2019t pay can be dis-enrolled, and anyone below the poverty level who fails to make payments is put into a \"basic\" plan that has fewer benefits and requires co-pays for care. It also includes financial disincentives to repeated use of hospital emergency rooms, among other provisions.\n\nCurrently in Appalachian Kentucky, at least one Medicaid managed care company charges small co-pays, doctors say, but federal law generally prohibits states from charging premiums for Medicaid recipients earning less than 150% of the federal poverty level.\n\nMicheal Richardson is a resident at the Layne House, a drug and alcohol treatment center in Prestonsburg, Ky. (Photo: By Pat McDonogh, The CJ)\n\nSelf-styled plans in several states with Medicaid \u201cwaivers\u201d from the federal government do include premiums and other cost-sharing, however. Arizona, which like Kentucky has a \u201ctraditional\u201d ACA Medicaid expansion, is seeking to join these states with a pending waiver application that would impose more costs on patients. But compared with other states, Solomon says Indiana\u2019s plan calls for \u201cthe maximum available cost-sharing.\u201d\n\nStudies are underway to assess the impact of Indiana\u2019s plan, but the jury is still out on whether the approach saves money, promotes more responsible behaviors or adds barriers to accessing care, Indiana University health researcher Kosali Simon says.\n\nBloomington, Ind.-based ACA \u201cnavigator\u201d David Meyer, who helped people enroll in Indiana\u2019s plan, says many of the poor struggle to navigate a complicated Medicaid system and pay monthly bills.\n\nTheir cost-sharing \u201cmay sound like Starbucks money to you and me, but it can be the difference between getting a prescription drug and not getting it,\u201d he says, adding that Kentucky Medicaid recipients could fall off the rolls if the state switches them to a new and more complex system.\n\nStudies back up his concerns. Research shows \"any financial barriers you put in place for Kentucky\u2019s lowest-income people can affect access to care,\u201d says Emily Beauregard, executive director of Kentucky Voices for Health.\n\nAt the same time, experts say small co-pays and premiums typically don\u2019t add up to meaningful revenue in state coffers \u2014 and may not even offset the cost of collecting them \u2014 with any savings likely coming from deferred care or fewer signing up for Medicaid.\n\nStill, recent research led by Benjamin Sommers, an assistant professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, shows that any Medicaid expansion is better than none. His study this month in the journal Health Affairs compared Kentucky with Texas, which didn\u2019t expand Medicaid, and Arkansas, which has a waiver plan that includes health savings accounts to which certain recipients make monthly contributions of $5 to $25 a month for co-pays and co-insurance.\n\nCompared with Texas, the study found, both Arkansas and Kentucky saw improved coverage and access to care.\n\nMixed opinions on cost-sharing\n\nIn the restaurants, barber shops and medical clinics tucked into the winding roads and mountainsides of Floyd County, there's disagreement about the potential impact of Medicaid changes.\n\nSome share Bevin\u2019s view that paying premiums gives people \u201ca vested interest\u201d in their care. \u201cHaving skin in the game is a big, big differentiator between whether or not the person has the dignity that goes with making decisions for themselves,\" he has said.\n\nLeft, Ralph Little and barber David Calhoun at Wright's Barber Shop in Prestonsburg, Ky. On the right is Henry Lewis and barber Gary Wright. (Photo: By Pat McDonogh, The CJ)\n\nDarrell Patton, a Prestonsburg insurance agent for nearly four decades, believes \u201cskin in the game\u201d is a good idea. While some of Patton's clients couldn\u2019t afford even small premiums, he says, too many work for cash and qualify for Medicaid while driving $40,000 trucks,\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t have any kind of responsibility, sometimes you\u2019ll seek the most convenient care \u2014 which is in a lot of cases the most expensive care,\u201d such as the ER, he says.\n\nOthers say it\u2019s not right to impose more costs on the neediest residents in a county where nearly one in three live in poverty. At a Floyd County drug treatment facility of bare rooms in an old roadside motel, 25-year-old Medicaid recipient and recovering addict Mike Richardson argued, \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t cost money to save a life.\u201d\n\nDye, the young single father, says premiums might prevent him from having insurance, and co-pays would limit his access to doctors or the anxiety medications he needs.\n\n\u201cI hate to see anybody pay to go get seen,\u201d says Dye, who is looking for a job but currently lives with his mother and has no car. \u201cI think they should just keep (Medicaid) the way it is.\u201d\n\nZachary Dye contemplates what his life would be like if Gov. Matt Bevin makes planned changes to Medicaid. Dye, from Martin, Ky. is unemployed and the father of a baby girl. He is seen in a restaurant in Prestonsburg, where he hoped to find a job. (Photo: By Pat McDonogh, The CJ)\n\nHealth care providers, meanwhile, wonder what Medicaid changes could mean for their practices.\n\nSantiesteban, the obstetrician/gynecologist, says the Medicaid expansion has really helped previously uninsured patients forced to delay care. But it\u2019s been tough on her business, and she doesn\u2019t expect that to change unless Bevin\u2019s proposal includes higher reimbursements for doctors. As it stands, she says, she\u2019s seen a flood of new Medicaid patients, many with complicated, time-consuming medical problems, which has meant \u201cI do a lot more with less pay.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost to the point where you\u2019re paying to see the patient,\u201d adds local podiatrist Robert Miller.\n\nRobert Miller, a podiatrist in Prestonsburg, Ky., listens to Sarah Beth Blankenship describe a problem she had with her foot on Jan 12, 2016. (Photo: By Pat McDonogh, The CJ)\n\nMore co-pays would only mean more challenges, Miller says, based on his experience with the one Medicaid plan he takes that charges them. Doctors must document that they tried to collect, and the cost of sending out letters to those who can\u2019t afford a $2 co-pay can be $5 or more.\n\nThursa Sloan, Floyd's public health director, says with all that\u2019s at stake, many in her community are anxiously waiting for Bevin to make a more concrete proposal by summer.\n\nMeantime, she says, \u201cit means more uncertainty for us.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1V5U9Uo", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Patients would share more costs in Kentucky Medicaid expansion.", "og": {"site_name": "USA TODAY", "description": "Patients would share more costs in Kentucky Medicaid expansion.", "title": "Appalachia tests Obamacare's evolution", "url": "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2016/01/19/appalachia-tests-obamacares-evolution/78803988/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Patients would share more costs in Kentucky Medicaid expansion.", "title": "Appalachia tests Obamacare's evolution", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1cd82cad3a7748505d5bb054299841931cfcf4e5/c=0-960-3840-4800&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/01/14/USATODAY/USATODAY/635883832091386161-PburgMcD-jpg.jpg", "creator": "@usatoday", "site": "@usatoday", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "fb": {"app_id": 215046668549694}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Organizations/Head Start", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Organizations/Head Start", "title": "Appalachia tests Obamacare's evolution", "author": "Laura Ungar and Chris Kenning", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/nation", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2495659f3130e7ec633839597cc03a63838d0a2c/c=0-320-3840-5440/local/-/media/2016/01/14/USATODAY/USATODAY/635883832091386161-PburgMcD-jpg.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8cafe7c892c11626e70e6e9b357ceccce251e9b5/c=0-960-3840-4800/local/-/media/2016/01/14/USATODAY/USATODAY/635883832091386161-PburgMcD-jpg.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/650e656df31805537ff00c5a97bd755dc9fa6caf/c=0-1436-3840-4323/local/-/media/2016/01/14/USATODAY/USATODAY/635883832091386161-PburgMcD-jpg.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/aedb40a984dbc05d8f50fb7ed005238019acb7e4/c=0-1795-3840-3964&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2016/01/14/USATODAY/USATODAY/635883832091386161-PburgMcD-jpg.jpg", "publishtime": "2016-01-19T14:21:27.370000-05:00", "shorthed": "Appalachia tests Obamacare's evolution", "articleid": 78803988, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/672db1d042bbb5a923a1f0e8fa667d5941f3f293/c=0-1795-3840-3964/local/-/media/2016/01/14/USATODAY/USATODAY/635883832091386161-PburgMcD-jpg.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2cb17075ea76444e712156ad410e75b9cc11e609/c=307-0-3533-5760/local/-/media/2016/01/14/USATODAY/USATODAY/635883832091386161-PburgMcD-jpg.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "Affordable Care Act, Prestonsburg, Kentucky, Gov.
