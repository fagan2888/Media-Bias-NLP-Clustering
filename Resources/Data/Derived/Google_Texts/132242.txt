Now you have two reasons to celebrate a Broncos win.

Elitch Gardens Theme Park is celebrating football season with a new discount ticket deal each time the Denver Broncos walk off the field with a victory. General admission tickets to the park will be available for $18 — yes, that’s Peyton Manning’s number — for one day after the team wins from Sept. 13 through Oct. 18.

Tickets purchased on that day will be valid for any day through the remainder of the park’s season, according to a press release sent by Elitch Gardens. This is so that visitors can experience fall events like Martial Arts Day, the Pet Parade and of course Fright Fest, opening Oct. 2, at the discounted rate.

Elitch Gardens is at 2000 Elitch Circle, Denver, CO 80204. Find more information at 303-595-4386, elitchgardens.com.
