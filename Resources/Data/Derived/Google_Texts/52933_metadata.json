We ask the departments to recognize that the requirement is unenforceable and to announce that it has been withdrawn,\u201d Ms. Guarisco Fildes wrote.\n\nThe biggest impact of the new cost-sharing rules will be on employers with high-deductible plans. For example, an Aon Hewitt survey found that just 17% of large and midsize employers offering high-deductible health care plans with health savings accounts had an embedded out-of-pocket limit.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Business Insurance", "description": "The ERISA Industry Committee is asking federal regulators to withdraw a recent \u201cclarification\u201d of health care reform law rules that place new limits starting next year on how much in out-of-pocket expenses employers with high-deductible plans can require employees to pick up.Under that...", "title": "Employer group wants new health out-of-pocket expense rule scrapped - Business Insurance", "url": "http://www.businessinsurance.com/article/20150619/NEWS03/150619790", "image": "http://www.businessinsurance.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CB/20150619/NEWS03/150619790/AR/0/out-of-pocket-health-care-expenses.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "The ERISA Industry Committee is asking federal regulators to withdraw a recent \u201cclarification\u201d of health care reform law rules that place new limits starting next year on how much in out-of-pocket expenses employers with high-deductible plans can require employees to pick up.Under that...", "image_src": "http://www.businessinsurance.com/assets/rwd/bi-logo-footer.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui", "title": "Employer group wants new health out-of-pocket expense rule scrapped - Business Insurance"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd9de\"", "article_summary": "For example, an Aon Hewitt survey found that just 17% of large and midsize employers offering high-deductible health care plans with health savings accounts had an embedded out-of-pocket limit.\n\u201cThe assertion that these plans are subject to the self-only limit when they provide coverage other than self-only coverage is not supported by the statute.\nSpecifically, the $6,850 annual cap on how much a plan participant can be required to pay will apply regardless if the individual has single or family coverage.\nThe ERISA Industry Committee, a Washington-based benefits lobbying group, said there is no basis in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act for a so-called embedded limit for an individual with family coverage.\nThe biggest impact of the new cost-sharing rules will be on employers with high-deductible plans."}
