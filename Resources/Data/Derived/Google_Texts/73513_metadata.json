Let\u2019s just hope for a great second run.\u201d\n\nWithout the bobble, Shiffrin probably would have been in second place behind pacesetter Eva-Marie Brem of Austria, who had the fastest first run by 1.14 seconds over the rest of the field. The second run is scheduled to start at 1 p.m.\n\nShiffrin said she has been battling a stomach illness.\n\n\u201cBut my energy actually feels really good and has for the past few days,\u201d Shiffrin said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s an issue today. I made kind of a stupid mistake coming onto the flats. My coach said be smart and be awake. I just went too straight, almost too awake a little bit. So, try to calm down a little bit for the second run and regroup. I feel like I made some good turns. It\u2019s there. Just have to get it out on the hill.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Mikaela Shiffrin in 10th place after first run at World Cup giant slalom", "title": "Mikaela Shiffrin in 10th place after first run at World Cup giant slalom", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/11/29/mikaela-shiffrin-in-10th-place-after-first-run-at-world-cup-giant-slalom/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141129__mihaela-shiffrin-aspenp1-1.jpg", "height": 369}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141129__mihaela-shiffrin-aspenp1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-29T12:25:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T21:30:38+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3231\"", "article_summary": "ASPEN \u2014 \u2014 EagleVail\u2019s Mikaela Shiffrin made a big mistake and a remarkable recovery in the first of two runs of World Cup giant slalom Saturday and stands in 10th place going into the second run.\nThe second run is scheduled to start at 1 p.m.Shiffrin said she has been battling a stomach illness.\nShiffrin went down on her right hip but managed to stay on course.\nSo, try to calm down a little bit for the second run and regroup.\nI just went too straight, almost too awake a little bit."}
