When it comes to marketing healthcare brands, patient centricity is equally vital. If marketers are to provide the best solutions for life sciences brands and services, understanding what makes patients tick needs to be at the top of any marketer's mind. With patients now -expected to help manage their own health, it's important that marketers adopt a patient-centric philosophy to stay in front of health-informed consumers to help prevent them from mistakenly seeking -inappropriate and misguided health content.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddress: Offices in Chicago and Los Angeles\n\nPhone: (312) 803-1900\n\nWebsite: www.gacommunication.com\n\nNew Business Contact: Joe Kuchta, CEO, jkuchta@gacommunication.com\n\nYear Founded: 1982 Employees: 102\n\nClick here to return to main story.", "article_metadata": {"com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages05.net,eventsforce.net,media.mmm-online.com,mmm-online.com", "description": "Company Profile \n\nWe are a full-service communication agency with a focus in the diverse healthcare space.
