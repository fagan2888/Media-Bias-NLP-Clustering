According to Amazon, she is expected to release a book later this year tentatively titled \u201cStonewalled: One Reporter's Fight for Truth in Obama's Washington.\u201d\n\nBrains & artistry behind my 2013 Emmy for Outstanding Investigative Journalism:Producer Kim Skeen,Editor Nancy Wyatt. pic.twitter.com/LHYrCyLGp1 \u2014 Sharyl Attkisson (@SharylAttkisson) October 12, 2013\n\nOther work attributed to Attkisson in recent months have included reports on the September 2012 storming of the American consulate in Benghazi, Libya and the tainted roll-out of the Affordable Care Act website by the White House, earning her the admiration of several contributors from the conservative-leaning Fox News network, including Stephen Hayes and Sean Hannity.\n\nAccording to another report published on Monday by Erik Wemple at the Washington Post, Attkisson has become increasingly frustrated in recent months because her reporting on Benghazi and other matters have been routinely nixed from television broadcasts of The CBS Evening News. Wemple went on to site an unnamed source at CBS who said that Attkisson felt she was being kept off the air \u201cbecause of political considerations.\u201d\n\nIn Byers\u2019 article for Politico, he alleged that those frustrations were severe enough that Attkisson approached management with her concerns nearly a year ago.\n\n\u201cFeeling increasingly stymied and marginalized at the network, Attkisson began talking to CBS News President David Rhodes as early as last April about getting out of her contract,\u201d Byers added. \u201cThose negotiations intensified in recent weeks, and her request was finally honored on Monday.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been one of life\u2019s great privileges to work at CBS News, and I\u2019m sincerely grateful for the many opportunities I\u2019ve had,\u201d Attkisson said in a statement.", "article_metadata": {"description": "CBS News investigative correspondent Sharyl Attkisson announced on Monday that she had resigned from the network after more than two decades, and sources say her departure stems from disagreements over her former employer\u2019s alleged bias.", "og": {"site_name": "RT International", "description": "CBS News investigative correspondent Sharyl Attkisson announced on Monday that she had resigned from the network after more than two decades, and sources say her departure stems from disagreements over her former employer\u2019s alleged bias.", "title": "CBS journalist reportedly resigns over network's pro-Obama bias", "locale": "en_EN", "image": "https://img.rt.com/files/news/23/70/a0/00/sharyl-attkisson.si.jpg", "url": "https://www.rt.com/usa/sharyl-attkisson-leaves-cbs-162/", "type": "article"}, "navigation": "tabbed", "twitter": {"description": "CBS News investigative correspondent Sharyl Attkisson announced on Monday that she had resigned from the network after more than two decades, and sources say her departure stems from disagreements over her former employer\u2019s alleged bias.", "title": "RT International", "image": "https://img.rt.com/files/news/23/70/a0/00/sharyl-attkisson.si.jpg", "creator": "@RT_com", "site": "@RT_com", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "HandheldFriendly": "true", "format-detection": "telephone=yes", "msvalidate.01": "36879475773792950F4872586A371571", "google-site-verification": "VQLbsaWKiXW2-Vt4lP7MevnhMES537NO4fQjfGgLcbI", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "MobileOptimzied": "width", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc97d7\"", "article_summary": "\u201cFeeling increasingly stymied and marginalized at the network, Attkisson began talking to CBS News President David Rhodes as early as last April about getting out of her contract,\u201d Byers added.\nAttkisson, an Emmy Award-winning journalist who previously worked for CNN, confirmed that she left CBS News with a single five-word message sent from her Twitter account on Monday afternoon.\nMoments later, Politico writer Dylan Byers reported on her exit and included remarks made by sources who say they\u2019re familiar with Attkisson\u2019s departure from CBS.\nCBS News investigative correspondent Sharyl Attkisson announced on Monday that she had resigned from the network after more than two decades, and sources say her departure stems from disagreements over her former employer\u2019s alleged bias.\n\u201cI have resigned from CBS,\u201d she wrote."}
