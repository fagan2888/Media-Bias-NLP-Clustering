Cannon Falls finished in third place. (Republican Eagle photo by Joe Brown)\n\nMoved into Class 2A after winning last year\u2019s 1A High Kick Division title, the Bombers were the smallest school in the class and had to prove they belonged with the bigger schools.\n\n\u201cThe competition is tough, but I think it makes us better. It makes us better competitors,\u201d said Cannon Falls co-captain Krystin Anderson.\n\nAnd in Saturday\u2019s High Kick championship meet, the Bombers made a statement to the rest of Class 2A with an impressive third-place finish.\n\n\u201cWhen we found out we were going up to 2A \u2026 we knew we weren\u2019t going to move up lightly,\u201d said Cannon Falls head coach Madi Salisbury. \u201cWe knew we were going to take it seriously, but I don\u2019t think we anticipated the magnitude of what we could accomplish.\n\n\u201cThe fact the girls are going home with a medal on their neck, they\u2019re completely overwhelmed.\u201d\n\nIn a tight top three, Cannon Falls had a finals score of 11. Totino-Grace won the state title for the first time in 14 years with a score of 7, while Sartell took second place with 9 points.\n\nAs great as last year\u2019s state title was in Class 1A, some of the Bombers came off the floor Saturday more proud of their white medals.\n\n\u201cOur goal was to always make it to state. We move to 2A and it\u2019s like, OK, we have to make our first impression. And to medal, that hasn\u2019t been done. No team has ever moved up and medaled (the next year),\u201d said senior Kelsie Beissel, who along with Anderson was named to the All-Tournament team. \u201cIt feels better than winning state last year.\u201d\n\nWhen they took to the floor, Cannon Falls\u2019 routine felt more like a war than a dance-team performance.\n\n\u201cI was like, \u2018Leave blood on the floor, it\u2019s a battle,\u2019\u201d Salisbury said with a laugh. \u201cAnd they were like, \u2018Rawr.\u2019 They were definitely into it, which was a great change of pace.\u201d\n\nAbandoning the big smiles and bright colors of most of the competition, the Bombers were backed with music called \u201cGuts and Glory,\u201d with smeared paint and scowls on their faces as they performed their high kick routine.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really nice girls, I promise,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cWe have to go out there and make it intense. We wanted it to be different. Everything else has this happy, peppy routine. We wanted to go out there and \u2026 we wanted to make everyone else mad.\u201d\n\nBeissel added, \u201cWe noticed that in the past, we\u2019ve always done the regular buns and smiles, and we were like, \u2018That\u2019s not us.\u2019 We found out that we have to get gritty and got to get mad to be successful. We found out our own style and it was exciting.\u201d\n\nThe mean-mugging quickly turned to tears as Cannon Falls\u2019 routine ended. Many of the dancers kissed the Target Center floor as they headed into the tunnel.\n\n\u201cWhen they exited, it was very overwhelming to see them so happy and so proud,\u201d Salisbury said. \u201cIt was so humbling to see them so proud of themselves.\u201d\n\nThe Bombers left their battlefield with medals and a third-place plaque. While not the blue medals that Totino-Grace walked off with, proving they belonged with Class 2A\u2019s best was the kind of statement Cannon Falls wanted to leave.\n\n\u201cWe were so united. I\u2019ve never had that in a team before,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cWe\u2019re all kind of best friends, so it was hard walking off that floor for the last time. It was just an amazing experience and I\u2019m so happy we even got here, much less placing. It was incredible.\u201d\n\nLake City misses top 10 cut\n\nIn the Class 1A High Kick Division championship, Section 1A champion Lake City was unable to get out of the preliminary round on Saturday.\n\nCompeting fourth, the Tigers were kept out of the championship hunt by Montevideo, Lac qui Parle Valley/Dawson-Boyd, Frazee, Aitkin, Yellow Medicine East and Pelican Rapids.\n\n\u201cEverybody danced their hearts out, I thought it went very well. We had a lot of energy in the routine and everyone felt confidence in how they performed,\u201d said Tigers head coach Wendy White. \u201cIt\u2019s just some days, some dances are better than others.\u201d\n\nIn the end, Aitkin won its second Class 1A High Kick title in three years, holding off YME and Frazee for top honors.\n\nLake City was left out after the early session, but with another year of experience, the Tigers feel confidence in their chances of a return next winter.\n\n\u201cBeing a brand-new coach, starting from ground zero and never coaching before, having a fairly new amount of new girls on the team that have come up, I\u2019d say we did pretty good this year from where we came from,\u201d White said. \u201cWe will start working even harder next year because we know our goal in the end. We\u2019ll all do what we can to obtain it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "sports,high school,Dance team,cannon falls bombers,Lake City Tigers", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Joe Brown", "og": {"site_name": "Republican Eagle", "description": "MINNEAPOLIS \u2013 Cannon Falls came onto the Target Center floor ready to do battle.\r\n\r\nMoved into Class 2A after winning last year\u2019s 1A High Kick Division title, the Bombers were the smallest school in the class and had to prove they belonged with the bigger schools.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe competition is tough,...", "title": "Dance Team: Bombers battle their way to third", "url": "http://www.republican-eagle.com/content/dance-team-bombers-battle-their-way-third", "image": {"width": 300, "identifier": "http://www.republican-eagle.com/sites/default/files/styles/square_300/public/field/image/CF%20war%20faces.jpg?itok=o45VJ8s1", "height": 300}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "MINNEAPOLIS \u2013 Cannon Falls came onto the Target Center floor ready to do battle.\r\n\r\nMoved into Class 2A after winning last year\u2019s 1A High Kick Division title, the Bombers were the smallest school in the class and had to prove they belonged with the bigger schools.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe competition is tough,...", "title": "Dance Team: Bombers battle their way to third", "url": "http://www.republican-eagle.com/content/dance-team-bombers-battle-their-way-third", "image": "http://www.republican-eagle.com/sites/default/files/styles/16x9_430/public/field/image/CF%20war%20faces.jpg?itok=2KVOQYBA", "site": "republicaneagle", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 243322109167890}, "keywords": "sports,high school,Dance team,cannon falls bombers,Lake City Tigers", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/redwingrepublicaneagle", "tag": "sports,high school,Dance team,cannon falls bombers,Lake City Tigers", "modified_time": "2014-02-18T12:40:10-06:00"}, "image": {"alt": "The Cannon Falls Bomber Dance Team performs during the championship portion of the Class 2A High Kick Division meet Saturday at Target Center in Minneapolis.
