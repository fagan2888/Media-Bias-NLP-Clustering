The traffic light at the intersection of NC 133 and Blackwell Road in Belville started working Aug. 21, 2015.

BELVILLE, NC (WWAY) â€” The stops lights are finally on at a busy intersection in Brunswick County.

Weather caused some delays on the project at the intersection of Blackwell Road and NC 133 in Belville. As of Thursday night the lights were still flashing, but Friday morning they were turning green, yellow and red.

While the NCDOT says this new signal marks a milestone in the Leland Causeway Project, construction will continue well into next year.
