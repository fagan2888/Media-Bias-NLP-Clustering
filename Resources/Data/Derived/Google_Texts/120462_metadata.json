Donald Trump was eviscerated in Thursday\u2019s debate. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz took turns pummeling the founder of Trump University with his own words, his own history, and delivering body blow after body blow.\n\nIt was more than enough to convince any thinking person he was not a serious candidate for president. But Trump isn\u2019t your typical presidential candidate. He\u2019s Barack Obama-light, in every sense of the term.\n\nWhat does Donald Trump stand for? What will he do if elected? What core conservative principle will he advance?\n\nIf you\u2019re being honest, the answer to each of those questions is you have no idea.\n\nDon\u2019t feel bad, neither does he.\n\nThat\u2019s not entirely true. He was fairly unambiguous about one thing he\u2019d like to do: change the law so he can sue newspapers. When it comes to solutions to the nation\u2019s problems, Donald Trump is the equivalent of a constitutional dumpster fire; and that\u2019s just fine to his worshipers.\n\nThe day after being embarrassed in front of the world, in part because of the lack of specifics he\u2019s provided as to what he would do as president, Trump held a press conference to get specific \u2013 or at least specific-ish \u2013 about this proposal. He said:\n\n\u201cOne of the things I\u2019m going to do, and this is going to make it tougher for me\u2026but one of the things I\u2019m going to do if I win\u2026is I\u2019m going to open up our libel laws so when they write purposely negative and horrible and false articles, we can sue them and win lots of money. We\u2019re going to open up those libel laws. So that when the New York Times writes a hit piece, which is a total disgrace, or when the Washington Post, which is there for other reasons, writes a hit piece, we can sue them and win money instead of having no chance of winning because they\u2019re totally protected.\u201d\n\nBy the way, the reason \u201cthey\u2019re totally protected\u201d right now is the First Amendment, that whole \u201cCongress shall make no law\u201d bit about freedom of the press. But who cares? Right, Trump fans?\n\nIt\u2019s the same stifling of speech outraging conservatives on college campuses; only it\u2019s Trump advancing it. If it\u2019s fascism when a student group proposes it, what is it when a billionaire does?\n\nHis supporters don\u2019t bother with strings of words ending in question marks. Their kryptonite is a simple \u201cHow?\u201d or the dreaded \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\nWhat does Donald Trump want to do as president? There is no answer yet articulated that wouldn\u2019t fit nicely on a bumper sticker. He wants to \u201cmake American great again,\u201d or \u201cbuild a wall,\u201d or \u201cdestroy ISIS,\u201d etc., etc. How?\n\nHe has no answer. He makes proclamations like a dime store Juan Per\u00f3n. Only he has no clue how a president must work with Congress to create or change laws. Trump supporters appear content to adopt the Barack Obama model of rule by executive fiat. They don\u2019t mind a despot as long as he\u2019s their despot.\n\nTrump\u2019s \u201cspecifics,\u201d such as they are, about his signature talking point is a wall that grows by 10 feet each time Mexican officials say they won\u2019t pay for it. It\u2019s at least 30 feet higher than when it started, but we\u2019re no closer to learning how it will be paid for. It just will be\u2026apparently.\n\nCheerleaders aren\u2019t even bothered by the fact that on his signature issue, immigration, he\u2019s imported workers rather than hire Americans. His claim of it being \u201cimpossible\u201d to find Americans to do his jobs is right out of the liberal playbook of \u201cjobs Americans won\u2019t do\u201d for illegal aliens.\n\nHis supporters don\u2019t give a damn about his hypocrisy any more than Hillary Clinton\u2019s, Barack Obama\u2019s or Al Gore\u2019s do.\n\nThey love he\u2019s \u201cself-funding\u201d his campaign because he \u201ccan\u2019t be bought.\u201d Do they think that will hold? A general election will cost at least $1 billion. Will Donald Trump mortgage his business on the possibility that, after alienating more than half the GOP, he\u2019ll win?\n\nHe doesn\u2019t have a billion in cash lying around. Since he\u2019s hiding his tax returns, most likely because he\u2019s not nearly as rich as he claims (he\u2019s sued over that before and lost), there\u2019s little chance he\u2019d be able to fund a tenth of a general election campaign.\n\nHe\u2019s gotten this far through free media. Sure, he\u2019s spent a few million once he absolutely had to, but the majority of his exposure comes from the cable networks taking every speech of his live, allowing him to phone in whenever he wants and being willing to broadcast any sycophant wannabe Trump staffer representing him unchallenged. Against Hillary Clinton that ends. He will need money, money he doesn\u2019t have.\n\nHe does have rich friends, and those friends would love to have a friend in the White House. And not because they\u2019d find it \u201ccool\u201d to sleep in the Lincoln bedroom.\n\nWhen Rubio and Cruz exposed Donald Trump\u2019s inability to explain what he\u2019d do, and how, on any issue beyond his memorized bumper stickers, they did the country a great service. Unfortunately, blinded by anger and hatred, his devotees refuse to see their emperor has no clothes, nor clue.\n\nThere is no issue on which you can find Donald Trump speaking eloquently, passionately, and with any detail that doesn\u2019t involve his poll numbers or his wealth. We have only his word to go on about his wealth, and his word has not always been accurate. That people are willing to believe him, unchallenged, and take offense when others do challenge him, is the mentality that has led to dark places in world history.\n\nScapegoating is a powerful weapon of manipulation, and Trump deploys it better than anyone in 80+ years. His followers want to \u201cburn it all down,\u201d so they\u2019re willing to blindly follow a pied piper down a very dangerous path. If they refuse to open their eyes, the dumpster fire they\u2019re franticly cheering will burn them down eventually too.\n\nPS: I urge you to watch this video, any part of it, and try to spot a coherent or even complete sentence from Trump. It\u2019s the ramblings of a man unhinged and incapable of serious or important discussion of any issue facing the country. It may make you laugh, but does it inspire? Is it remotely presidential?", "article_metadata": {"description": "There he was, stripped bare and standing in the middle of the debate stage. Donald Trump was eviscerated in Thursdays debate.
