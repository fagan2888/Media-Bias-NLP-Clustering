She says the lessons of that epic failure and recovery serve as a guide to how technology can and must make government work efficiently.\n\nPahlka is the founder and director of Code for America, a nonprofit organization that promotes technological solutions to government inefficiencies. She also served as deputy U.S. chief technology officer, concentrating on a program to create a U.S. equivalent to the UK's successful Government Digital Service.\n\nPahlka spoke at Town Hall Seattle on March 6. This talk was presented by Town Hall and University Book Store as part of the Civics Series.
