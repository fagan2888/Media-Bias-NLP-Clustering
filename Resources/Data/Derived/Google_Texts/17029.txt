Researchers with Yale University have created maps of public opinions of climate change down to the county-by-county level.

The maps by the Project on Climate Change Communication use data and estimates provided by Yale and Utah State University.

They track by state, congressional district and county public opinion on whether climate change is happening, whether humans are causing it, how worried people are and policy questions like whether the government should regulate carbon dioxide emissions or fund renewable energy.

“We undertook this project because most of the action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prepare for climate impacts is happening at the state and local levels of American society,” the project, headed by professor Anthony Leiserowitz, said in a Monday blog post.

“Yet elected officials, the media, advocates, and educators currently know little about public climate change opinion at these sub-national levels.”

The maps show that 52 percent of Americans are worried about climate change.

“But this national number glosses over the enormous geographic diversity in public opinion across the country — diversity that is revealed for the first time in these maps,” the researchers said.
