Doesn\u2019t requiring the Christian owners of Hobby Lobby or Conestoga Wood Products to cut their conscience to fit the ACLU\u2019s atheism constitute a situation where the ACLU itself is trying to use the law to \u201cimpose their beliefs on others\u201d?\n\nAccording to the ACLU\u2019s reading of the First Amendment, it\u2019s OK to have \u201cfreedom of worship,\u201d which means keeping religious stuff strictly in your head or behind church doors. But God help you if you try to live it out in the real world, where the ACLU prowls for \u201cvictims.\u201d\n\nOn the bright side, the ACLU is doing us all a favor by keeping track of its many religious-freedom challenges to the oppressive Obamacare contraceptive mandate across the nation.\n\n\u201cTo date, 101 cases have been filed challenging the rule as an infringement on religious liberty,\u201d the ACLU states on its website. \u201cEighty-nine of these cases are currently pending: 41 cases brought by nonprofit organizations, 45 cases brought by for-profit companies, and three cases brought by both nonprofit and for-profit plaintiffs.\u201d\n\nThe devil\u2019s law firm and other atheistic groups are also actively attacking religious freedom by contending that religiously affiliated schools cannot require employees to live by religious standards.\n\nIn 2012, in the Hosanna-Tabor case, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 9-0 that the government cannot interfere with religious groups\u2019 faith-based employment qualifications. The lawsuits keep coming, though.\n\nIn 2013, San Diego Christian College dismissed an employee, Teri James, who had become pregnant out of wedlock. She retained feminist camera-hog lawyer Gloria Allred and sued the university, even though Ms. James had signed a covenant as a condition of employment agreeing not to engage in certain behaviors, including premarital sex. What\u2019s a promise or a contract worth?\n\n\u201cWomen out there should not have to worry about losing their income and independence just because they are carrying a child,\u201d Ms. James said in a statement.\n\nIndependence? She means that the school has a duty to support her in the manner in which she is accustomed even if she breaks their rules. The ACLU summed up the situation this way:\n\n\u201cThere are cases of religious schools firing employees who are unmarried and pregnant, for example, in the name of religion.\u201d\n\nWell, yes. A Christian school should have the right to employ people who abide by Christian values, such as keeping sex within marriage. What\u2019s the point of having an expressly Christian organization if the people within it openly defy its values?\n\nWould the ACLU be comfortable hiring someone who opposes abortion on demand or homosexual \u201cmarriage\u201d? How about an anti-porn advocate?\n\nIn Missouri, the American Humanist Association is threatening to sue because one recruit was made uncomfortable when he spotted some donated Gideon Bibles on a shelf at a National Guard intake center in St. Louis. Maybe the recruit would benefit from a stint in a country not yet influenced by Christianity\u2019s unique respect for individual rights.\n\nThe ACLU is the point of the spear, legally speaking, of a larger leftist campaign to fundamentally transform America into a place where fornication of any kind under the sun trumps all other human rights. It\u2019s the only freedom we\u2019ll have left after they establish government-enforced diversity re-education to stamp out anything resembling traditional religious values.\n\nAchieving diversity used to mean ending discrimination based on race, ethnicity or other immutable characteristics. Now it means dividing people into groups based on grievances and then constantly inflaming those sore points. Google the \u201cwar on women\u201d for more details.\n\nFor good measure, anyone resisting this onslaught is said to be \u201cobsessed\u201d with it, as though the activists demanding a wholesale moral meltdown are, by contrast, only casually involved.\n\nIn his classic, \u201cThe Screwtape Letters,\u201d C.S. Lewis\u2019 professorial devil instructs his demon nephew that in order to make it easier to steal souls, \u201cAll extremes except extreme devotion to [God] are to be encouraged. Not always, of course, but at this period.\n\n\u201cSome ages are lukewarm and complacent, and then it is our business to soothe them yet faster asleep. Other ages, of which the present is one, are unbalanced and prone to faction, and it is our business to inflame them.\u201d\n\nFor decades, the ACLU has been reading the devil\u2019s mail and acting accordingly.\n\nThey\u2019ve learned only too well how to \u201cimpose their beliefs on others.\u201d\n\nRobert Knight is senior fellow for the American Civil Rights Union and a columnist for The Washington Times.", "article_metadata": {"description": "For an organization that frequently goads government into advancing an atheistic viewpoint on everyone within reach, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) talks a good game about how wrong it is for some people to \"impose their beliefs on others.\"", "Author": "Robert Knight", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "For an organization that frequently goads government into advancing an atheistic viewpoint on everyone within reach, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) talks a good game about how wrong it is for some people to \u201cimpose their beliefs on others.\u201d", "title": "KNIGHT: ACLU preying on America\u2019s better angels", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/aug/8/knight-preying-on-americas-better-angels/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/08/08/8_8_2014_b1-knight8201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/08/08/8_8_2014_b1-knight8201.jpg", "title": "KNIGHT: ACLU preying on America\u2019s better angels", "description": "For an organization that frequently goads government into advancing an atheistic viewpoint on everyone within reach, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) talks a good game about how wrong it is f", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc84c\"", "article_summary": "According to the ACLU\u2019s reading of the First Amendment, it\u2019s OK to have \u201cfreedom of worship,\u201d which means keeping religious stuff strictly in your head or behind church doors.\n\u201cTo date, 101 cases have been filed challenging the rule as an infringement on religious liberty,\u201d the ACLU states on its website.\nA Christian school should have the right to employ people who abide by Christian values, such as keeping sex within marriage.\nThey\u2019ve learned only too well how to \u201cimpose their beliefs on others.\u201dRobert Knight is senior fellow for the American Civil Rights Union and a columnist for The Washington Times.\n\u201cWhile religious freedom gives us all the right to make personal decisions about how to practice religion,\u201d the ACLU states, \u201cit doesn\u2019t give institutions or individuals the right to impose their beliefs on others.\u201dReally?"}
