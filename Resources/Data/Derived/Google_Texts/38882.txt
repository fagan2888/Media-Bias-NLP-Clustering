A 43 percent drop in Fox News Channel’s viewership last week coincided with a dispute between 21st Century Fox and Dish Network that left the channel dark for Dish’s 14 million customers.

But a similar decline occurred a year ago, when there wasn’t a blackout. A Fox News spokesperson cited numbers from Nielsen, the ratings company that tracks TV viewership.

In 2013, Fox News also saw a 42 percent drop in viewers during the week of Christmas, according to Nielsen.

The TV research company noted that Fox News viewers have been dwindling all month, from 1,723,000 million viewers in the first week of December, ending Dec. 7, to 939,000 in the last week, ending Dec. 28.

Competing news channel MSNBC similarly saw a decline in the last two weeks of 2014, with viewership dropping 21 percent to 402,000.

CNN improved to 484,000, up 10 percent.

Dish customers have been unable to watch Fox News and Fox Business News since negotiations between the companies reached an impasse Dec. 20.

At the time, Dish said Fox was asking for triple its rate if Dish wanted to offer the channels to its 14 million subscribers.

Dish has changed some content around, temporarily offering Glenn Beck’s The Blaze on Channel 205 and NewsMax on Channel 206, according to its consumer site, dishstandsforyou.com. Fox News has its own consumer advocacy site, keepfoxnews.com.

Douglas County-based Dish had no further comment Friday.
