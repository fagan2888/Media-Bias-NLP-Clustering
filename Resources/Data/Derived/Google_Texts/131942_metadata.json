Under the healthcare law's requirement set to go into effect in 2015, employers with 50 or more full-time workers must provide health insurance.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe House passed the measure in March by a vote of 406-1 , but it stalled in the Senate. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said the bill would come up again when the 114th Congress convenes in January.\n\n\"Come January, at the beginning of the new Congress, the House will pass the Hire More Heroes Act again, sending it back to the Senate so that it can finally reach the President\u2019s desk,\" McCarthy wrote in a blog post.\n\nMcCarthy noted that the veterans who receive health coverage through the Department of Defense or Veterans Affairs through programs like TRICARE already satisfy the healthcare law's requirement of having insurance, making it unnecessary that their new employers provide coverage for them.\n\n\"The Hire More Heroes Act, introduced by Representative Rodney Davis [R-Ill.], makes sure no employers are penalized for hiring a veteran and that no veteran is left jobless because of Obamacare\u2019s employer mandate,\" McCarthy wrote.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The bill would allow businesses to hire veterans without counting them toward the healthcare law's employer mandate.", "description": "The bill would allow businesses to hire veterans without counting them toward the healthcare law's employer mandate.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Floor Action"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The bill would allow businesses to hire veterans without counting them toward the healthcare law's employer mandate.", "title": "House to vote on 'Hire More Heroes Act' again in new Congress", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/223630-house-to-vote-on-hire-more-heroes-act-again-in-new-congress", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-11-11T10:28:15-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2014-11-11T10:28-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/223630-house-to-vote-on-hire-more-heroes-act-again-in-new-congress", "dcterms.date": "2014-11-11T10:28-05:00", "dcterms.creator": "Cristina Marcos", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "author": "Cristina Marcos", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Veterans,Kevin McCarthy, Rodney Davis,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-11T10:28:17-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-11T10:28:15-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/223630-house-to-vote-on-hire-more-heroes-act-again-in-new-congress", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The bill would allow businesses to hire veterans without counting them toward the healthcare law's employer mandate.", "card": "summary", "title": "House to vote on 'Hire More Heroes Act' again in new Congress"}, "dcterms.title": "House to vote on 'Hire More Heroes Act' again in new Congress"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2c5d\"", "article_summary": "The House will vote on legislation in the new Congress to incentivize businesses to hire more veterans by excluding them from the healthcare law's employer mandate.\nHouse Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said the bill would come up again when the 114th Congress convenes in January.\n\"Come January, at the beginning of the new Congress, the House will pass the Hire More Heroes Act again, sending it back to the Senate so that it can finally reach the President\u2019s desk,\" McCarthy wrote in a blog post.\nADVERTISEMENTThe House passed the measure in March by a vote of 406-1 , but it stalled in the Senate.\nUnder the healthcare law's requirement set to go into effect in 2015, employers with 50 or more full-time workers must provide health insurance."}
