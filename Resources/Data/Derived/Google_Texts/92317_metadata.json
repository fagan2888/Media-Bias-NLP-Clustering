In Arizona, approximately 34 percent of Hispanic children are living in poverty. This, and several other reasons, may be contributing to the high percentage of Hispanic children that are uninsured.\n\nAfter the freezing of the KidsCare - Arizona\u2019s Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program in January 2010 due to a lack of funding, many of the state\u2019s youth were left uninsured until the expansion of Medicaid in 2013 under the Affordable Care Act. This made Arizona the only state in the union that did not provide healthcare for youth under 18 years old during this time, according to a report on the state\u2019s website.\n\n\u201cPoverty is, I think, really one of the big, big underlying factors,\u201d said Andrea Romero, director of the Frances McClelland Institute at the UA. \u201cThe amount of children living in poverty in Arizona is remarkable.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Kids Count Data Center, 34.1 percent of Hispanic children are living below the poverty level in Arizona.\n\nThe prevalence of poverty combined with the removal of a free access health care program for children is accounting for the higher rates of uninsured children to a great degree, according to Romero.\n\nIn addition to poverty, another obstacle is the language barrier.\n\nJorge Bours, a political science senior, said that this is a huge issue considering the percentage of Latino families that call Arizona home.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s confusing for some Hispanic families to choose certain plans and policies in a country where they might not speak the language,\u201d he said.\n\nArizona is home to many different ethnic groups and has one of the largest populations of Latinos in the U.S. Despite this, Arizona is ranked third highest for the percentage of children uninsured.\n\n\u201cThis same struggle may also stand as an issue for immigrants and their families, as the bureaucratic processes for them make it really difficult to reach out for necessary things such as health insurance,\u201d Bours said. \u201cArizona has some of the toughest immigration laws in the United States since the Senate Bill 1070 was signed into law in 2010.\u201d\n\nArizona laws against illegal immigrants prohibit them from receiving public benefits, such as health care.\n\nThere are some Hispanic families that are hesitant to apply for health insurance through the government because they have what is called a \u201cmixed status household.\u201d\n\nA mixed status household refers to any circumstance where only one person in the family may be undocumented but the rest of the family members classify as legal citizens, Romero said.\n\nAlthough there is only a small percentage of people in this situation, it stands as another barrier that may prevent families from getting their children covered under medical insurance.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so critical for children to have health access because then they can get their shots and early screenings to find out if there is any health issues of concern,\u201d Romero said.\n\nIn a report conducted by Romero and her colleagues, data shows that Latino youth show more mental and physical health problems than any other ethnicity. This raises even more of a concern for Arizona\u2019s percentage of uninsured Hispanic children, as they may be the ones who need it most.\n\n\u201cIt has a huge negative impact if our youth are not getting the health access they need,\u201d Romero said.\n\nFollow Mackenzie Boulter on Twitter.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.wildcat.arizona.edu/article/2016/01/hispanic-children-in-az-are-grossly-underinsured", "image": "http://d1kuv9frcfm3m7.cloudfront.net/20150818Xkx8qk2H8x/dist/images/fb-hidden-icon.png", "type": "article", "description": "While the federal government is fighting over socialized health care, a large percentage of the populations most vulnerable are left uninsured.", "title": "Hispanic children in AZ are grossly underinsured"}, "twitter": {"site": "@dailywildcat", "card": "summary"}, "viewport": "width=device-width", "generator": "Gryphon 20160217001 (Foundry 6.1-20150615001)", "description": "While the federal government is fighting over socialized health care, a large percentage of the populations most vulnerable are left uninsured."}, "article_summary": "This raises even more of a concern for Arizona\u2019s percentage of uninsured Hispanic children, as they may be the ones who need it most.\nThis, and several other reasons, may be contributing to the high percentage of Hispanic children that are uninsured.\n\u201cThe amount of children living in poverty in Arizona is remarkable.\u201dAccording to the Kids Count Data Center, 34.1 percent of Hispanic children are living below the poverty level in Arizona.\nHispanic children in AZ are grossly underinsuredBy Mackenzie Boulter | Published 01/27/16 9:00amWhile the federal government is fighting over socialized health care, a large percentage of the populations most vulnerable are left uninsured.\nIn Arizona, approximately 34 percent of Hispanic children are living in poverty."}
