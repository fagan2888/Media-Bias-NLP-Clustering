According to the authors, studies on these unscientific practices are a waste of already limited resources. Reiki practitioners paint a different picture, suggesting their treatment adds to medical science rather than diminish its value, and is therefore deserving of trials.\n\nDavid H. Gorski and Steven Novella have co-authored a paper calling for the end of clinical trials of \u201chighly implausible treatment,\u201d such as homeopathy and reiki. The authors believe that testing for this \u201cpseudoscience\u201d is a waste of already tight medical budgets and only \u201cserves to lend legitimacy to otherwise dubious practices.\u201d In a recent press release, Gorski and Novella explain how, in their opinion, more \u201cbiologically plausible treatments\u201d should move onto randomized trials and how the continuation of studying holistic treatment is \u201ca losing proposition.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to treating patients, traditional physicians and spiritual healers often butt heads. Long Island-based mother-daughter spiritual healers, AnnMarie Citarella, a Reiki master teacher, and Theresa Citarella, a Reiki practitioner, explained to Medical Daily their feelings on Gorski and Novella\u2019s proposition. \u201cI\u2019m disappointed because I think that with clinical trials that they can actually prove the benefits of Reiki. They will prove that this is such a wonderful and positive way to deal with people who are sick,\u201d AnnMarie said.\n\nRegardless, her daughter, Theresa, added that she doesn\u2019t feel a lack of clinical trials on the alternative healing would seriously affect Reiki\u2019s popularity. \u201cObviously the science will help it if there is solid research backing it. There are people in this world that need that science,\u201d she said, adding that even without trials, \u201cReiki will continue on.\u201d\n\nAccording to the duo, Reiki is meant to be used alongside science-based medicine, not in place of it. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t take away from medical treatment. \u2026 This is not to diagnose them or anything. It\u2019s meant to work in complementary solidarity,\u201d AnneMarie said. Rather than working to cure the disease, AnnMarie focuses on relieving its symptoms. \u201cEven though the cancer is not completely gone, the side effects are much less,\u201d she explained, referring to the results of her clients undergoing chemotherapy. \u201cReiki can never harm someone. If you are open-minded, then it is only going to help,\u201d her daughter added.\n\nGorski, however, painted a different picture of this complementary relationship between holistic care and sciences, explaining to Medical Daily via email that the once-separated practices are now increasingly integrated. \u201cThe two are no longer separate. They are being combined in a specialty that was originally called 'complementary and alternative medicine' (CAM) but has been reborn as 'integrative medicine,'\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to the doctor, this integration is anything but good and detracts from rather than contributes to science-healing. \u201cIf you mix cow pie with apple pie, it does not make the cow pie taste better; it makes the apple pie worse,\u201d Gorski said. \u201cIntegrative medicine undermines the scientific basis of medicine by 'integrating' magical thinking and pseudoscience with evidence-based medicine. There\u2019s a reason I tend to refer to this as quackademic medicine.\u201d\n\nThe paper is just a suggestion at the moment, and currently many highly reputable medical organizations back the use of holistic care alongside science to help speed up a patient's healing process. Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer, the Cleveland Clinic, and MD Anderson Cancer Center, just to name a few, all offer holistic-based medicine programs alongside traditional treatment.\n\n\u201cIf they do stop the trials, reiki will never stop,\u201d concluded AnnMarie, alluding to an aspect of her healing that is simply immeasurable in scientific terms. \u201cYou have to experience it. You can\u2019t talk about it. Everyone should at least experience it just once to understand.\u201d\n\nSource: Gorski DH, Novella SP.
