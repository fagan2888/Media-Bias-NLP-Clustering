Covered California has never provided the list it promised of participating doctors and hospitals, for various reasons, and doesn't seem likely to in the near future.\n\n\"We take these charges seriously, and believe enrollees should be as informed as possible about the products they select,\" Blue Shield of California spokesman Sean Barry told Reuters.\n\nYes they should.\n\nThe state did put up a list months after the website debuted, but quickly took it down because it was inaccurate. Turns out, one of the complicating factors was a lot of doctors had no idea they were obligated under previous contracts with insurers to join the network and they were now resistant. Blue Shield would tell consumers their doctors were in the network and the doctors would tell them no.\n\nThe state now says it might not have a functioning directory of providers until 2015.\n\nLegitimate publications were noting the deficiency as far back as June 2013, but no one had definitive numbers on network sizes. Chris Lewis wrote at HealthLeaders InterStudy that the newly unveiled Covered California premiums were lower than expected because of narrow networks \u201cto make the financials work in a heavily-regulated environment.\u201d\n\nShe knew even then that \u201cand in most cases, members won\u2019t have access to marquee systems such as UCLA Health System or Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.\u201d\n\nWonkish Mother Jones blogger Kevin Drum noted on November 18 that there was legitimate buzz about \u201cnetwork shock which had potential to be serious, although he was \u201ca little surprised at how little concrete data we have on a lot of this stuff.\u201d It had already been a Fox hobbyhorse for awhile.\n\nA week later Drum acknowledged network shock was significant for some consumers, but said that website problems were the big issue. Within a couple weeks he had upped the ante and wrote there could be \u201csubstantial dissatisfaction from consumers,\u201d depending on how narrow the networks were.\n\nHe noted that Megan McArdle at Bloomberg was probably right that \u201caverage folks don't think like healthcare wonks\u201d and didn't know the smaller networks were coming, but they should have. America's healthcare industry has been doing that since at least 1998 and the rise of PPOs, HMOs and POSs was based on restricted networks. Somebody wasn't paying attention.\n\nEven if they had been, getting a handle on the numbers is difficult. Lewis last June referenced a Los Angeles Times number that only 36% of Blue Shield doctors would be in the Covered California network. The San Francisco Chronicle wrote in January that Blue Shield's Covered California network included just 60% of its doctors and 70% of its hospitals.\n\n\u201cIn this new reform era, narrow networks are a fact of life that ironically harkens to the HMO foundation of the state,\u201d Lewis wrote. \u201cThe restriction of choice could be considered a small price to pay for those who are now priced out or otherwise excluded from coverage.\u201d\n\nCould be.
