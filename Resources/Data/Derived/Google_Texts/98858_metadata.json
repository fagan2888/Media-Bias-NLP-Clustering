Pressure from health advocates compelled the researchers to include smoking cessation counseling for the participants of early trials. Then it was revealed that some of the early work was sponsored by a tobacco company.\n\nAs for winning the battle, reducing the number of lung cancer deaths by 20 percent may be significant, but we already know how to reduce the number of lung cancer deaths by 90 percent \u2014 regulate cigarettes out of existence. All the steps required have been mapped out by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the 2014 Surgeon General\u2019s Report. We just need to persuade some politicians to act.\n\nEDWARD ANSELM\n\nNew York, Sept. 22, 2014\n\nThe writer is medical director of Health Republic Insurance of New Jersey and an assistant professor of medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nI encourage smokers and former smokers to seek out more information about the benefits and risks of lung cancer screening, then make an informed choice about what is right for them.\n\nHere are some additional facts and issues to consider (drawn partly from an excellent Veterans Affairs publication called \u201cScreening for Lung Cancer\u201d):\n\n\u25a0 The evidence for benefit is based on a single, carefully conducted trial. It is unclear if the benefits shown in this trial will be replicated in routine practice.\n\n\u25a0 The benefit of screening is small but important. According to research, with screening, three fewer people out of 1,000 would die from lung cancer over six years compared with those electing not to be screened.\n\n\u25a0 Potential harms: Of 1,000 people screened over three years, 365 would have a false alarm. The false alarms would lead to additional testing, and a few people would experience serious complications from this testing.\n\n\u25a0 Only 25 percent of participants in the trial were older than 65, and none were older than 74. False positive rates and the complications from biopsies of lung nodules are higher in older adults. The potential benefit from lung cancer screening in older adults may be substantially less than observed in the trial.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhile it is laudable that some hospitals provide CT screening free to all qualified high-risk individuals, patients will need good insurance for further testing and treatment if they have a positive test. I am not arguing for or against screening, but rather that people should have the facts and discuss with their physician what is best for them.\n\nJOHN WILLIAMS\n\nChapel Hill, N.C., Sept. 22, 2014\n\nThe writer, an internist, is a professor of medicine at Duke University Medical Center.\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nAs a supporter of the Affordable Care Act, I find Andrea McKee and Andrew Salner\u2019s Op-Ed essay both hopeful and worrisome. They report significantly improved lung cancer survival rates for \u201ccurrent and former heavy smokers\u201d who have a CT scan that costs several hundred dollars. They add that the \u201cscreenings will be more affordable\u201d when the Affordable Care Act lists them as free preventive services in January 2015. They urge Medicare to follow suit.\n\nBut individual affordability means shared expense. The writers note the estimated nine million beneficiaries, but not the collective cost of perhaps $3 billion or more based on their figures. As the Affordable Care Act increases our shared responsibilities for one another\u2019s health care costs, perhaps we should limit \u201cfree\u201d (that is, jointly paid) preventive services to cases involving a common health risk rather than a recognized personal risk.\n\nDAVID CRAIG\n\nIndianapolis, Sept. 23, 2014\n\nThe writer is the author of \u201cHealth Care as a Social Good: Religious Values and American Democracy.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20140929193016, "twitter": {"description": "Readers discuss the benefits and drawbacks of expanded screenings.", "title": "Screening Smokers for Lung Cancer", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/30/opinion/screening-smokers-for-lung-cancer.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003146801"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/09/30/opinion/0930lettersCANCER/0930lettersCANCER-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/30/opinion/screening-smokers-for-lung-cancer.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003146801", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/30/opinion/screening-smokers-for-lung-cancer.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion", "hdl_p": "Screening Smokers for Lung Cancer", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Sept. 29, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Lung Cancer,Smoking and Tobacco,Preventive Medicine,Tests (Medical),Medicare,Health Insurance and Managed Care", "description": "Readers discuss the benefits and drawbacks of expanded screenings.", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/09/30/opinion/0930lettersCANCER/0930lettersCANCER-thumbLarge.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "slug": "l30cancer", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Readers discuss the benefits and drawbacks of expanded screenings.", "tom": "Letter", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/09/30/opinion/0930lettersCANCER/0930lettersCANCER-thumbStandard.jpg", "news_keywords": "Medicare", "CG": "opinion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Sept. 29, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Letter", "article": {"section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified": "2014-09-30", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Health Insurance and Managed Care", "published": "2014-09-29", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140930003202, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/30/opinion/screening-smokers-for-lung-cancer.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/09/30/opinion/0930lettersCANCER/0930lettersCANCER-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Readers discuss the benefits and drawbacks of expanded screenings.", "title": "Screening Smokers for Lung Cancer"}, "pdate": 20140929, "des": "Health Insurance and Managed Care", "articleid": 100000003146801, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Screening Smokers for Lung Cancer", "col": "Letters", "PST": "Letter"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfef0\"", "article_summary": "As for winning the battle, reducing the number of lung cancer deaths by 20 percent may be significant, but we already know how to reduce the number of lung cancer deaths by 90 percent \u2014 regulate cigarettes out of existence.\nTo the Editor:I encourage smokers and former smokers to seek out more information about the benefits and risks of lung cancer screening, then make an informed choice about what is right for them.\nThe potential benefit from lung cancer screening in older adults may be substantially less than observed in the trial.\nThey report significantly improved lung cancer survival rates for \u201ccurrent and former heavy smokers\u201d who have a CT scan that costs several hundred dollars.\nAccording to research, with screening, three fewer people out of 1,000 would die from lung cancer over six years compared with those electing not to be screened."}
