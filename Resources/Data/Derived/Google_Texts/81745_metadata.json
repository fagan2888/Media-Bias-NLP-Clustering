First date? Too much, too soon. Wait until the third date and you risk being considered a tease. Second date? Perhaps, but at this point you\u2019re both still fretting over whether or not to eat another piece of bread; delving into sexual histories (or lack thereof) seems a bit extreme. So: There\u2019s no good time to tell a guy you\u2019re a virgin. Even worse? Telling him you\u2019re waiting until marriage.\n\nI should be better at sharing this bit of information by now. I\u2019m a 26-year-old woman with a college degree, a good job, an adorable duplex and no debt. I have a solid group of friends, a supportive family and a clear awareness of who I am and who I want to be. By most accounts, I am a successful human being. Yet the moment I have to tell the guy I\u2019m dating that sex is not an option, I become a squirmy, awkward, fidgety girl who can\u2019t make eye contact or put together a complete sentence. Think junior high dance, only without a bathroom to hide in.\n\nThe Chat was never really an issue for me until three years ago. I wasn\u2019t like many teens, who consider sex a rite of passage. It\u2019s true I always had a crush on one (or two) boys and had my fair share of boyfriends, but no relationship ever got serious enough where sex was even a thought, let alone a deal breaker. For most of my junior high and high school years, I played the role of the friend \u2014 the token girl in a group of boys who were more interested in taking my advice for how to ask a girl to prom than taking me to prom. And given the choice between having just one boy with whom to spend all my time or a group of boys, friends trumped boyfriend.\n\nIn college there were a handful of guys who probably could have been my first, but things never quite worked out. One guy confessed to having a girlfriend back home just as I started to fall for him. Another had such low self-esteem he wouldn\u2019t make a move until just before he passed out. The most serious contender waited until I was so smitten with him that I would break plans, skip class, call in sick \u2014 whatever \u2014 to drive hours to visit him, and then dumped me, saying it \u201cjust wasn\u2019t a good time for him.\u201d\n\nAnother reason sex didn\u2019t factor into my coming-of-age years is that I\u2019m a Christian. Not a Bible-thumping, the-world-is-going-to-hell-in-a-handbasket Christian, but a (sexually) conservative, Bible-believing, traditionally raised Minnesota Lutheran girl who was taught that sex is for marriage and that\u2019s that. Heck, the first time I even heard of a blow job was when I threw a party in eighth grade and my mom caught a girl going down on a guy in our basement. She was shockingly cool about it (which is saying something: my mom was the Mom of all Moms; the woman all my friends feared, revered and secretly worshiped) and let the party play out until everyone had gone home. Then all hell broke loose \u2014 at least that\u2019s how it seemed to my eighth-grade, never-been-kissed self. She sat me down at the kitchen table, folded her hands, looked me straight in the eyes and said, \u201cLet\u2019s talk about oral sex.\u201d I\u2019d thought the birds-and-bees talk was painful; this was torture.\n\nI don\u2019t know whether it was hearing my mom explain the basics of oral sex, the embarrassment of having not previously known about this particular genre or the fact that she caught two of my friends actually engaging in this in my basement, but let\u2019s just say I never fully recovered from that centuries-long five-minute conversation.\n\nSomething else that has kept my pants on all these years: Despite my Miss Independent, one-of-the-guys, often cynical/always logical demeanor, I am a hopeless romantic. I believe wholeheartedly that sex and love should coexist. In fact, I believe they need to coexist; that without love, sex is just a Band-Aid fix for something that should be addressed with words rather than walks of shame. What\u2019s more, I\u2019m an obnoxiously picky person who avoids letting go of control, being vulnerable and making mistakes at all costs \u2014 a by-the-book Type-A perfectionist. The longer I go without sex, the more build-up there is: the more anxiety and curiosity, fear and desire, anticipation and uncertainty. Basically, what was once just another bit of my identity has, over 26 years, become a defining element of who I am, whether I like it or not.\n\nDespite what you may think, abstaining has not made me a miserable, lonely, pleasure-deprived shell of a person. Nor am I anti-sex. In fact, I\u2019m all for sex \u2014 from what I\u2019ve heard, it\u2019s fantastic! Life-changing! Glorious! (At least when it\u2019s good.) I cannot wait to have sex someday. Right now, however, I appreciate \u2014 and even take pride in \u2014 my virginity. It separates me from other women. Not in an \u201cI\u2019m better than them\u201d way, but in the same way that being taller than most makes someone unique, or having two different-colored eyes. As for The Chat, I\u2019ve found that over time it\u2019s become more of a Dude Decoder than Relationship Wrecker.
