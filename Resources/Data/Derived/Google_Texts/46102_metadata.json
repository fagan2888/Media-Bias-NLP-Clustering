It remains to be seen how much damage this rule will actually cause. The reality is that there is no evidence for the large effects that are central to right-wing ideology, so the question is whether CBO will be forced to accept supply-side fantasies.\n\nMeanwhile, one thing is fairly certain: CBO won\u2019t be applying dynamic scoring to the positive effects of government spending, even though there\u2019s a lot of evidence for such effects.\n\nA good piece in yesterday\u2019s Upshot reports on a recent study of the effects of Medicaid for children; it shows that children who received the aid were not just healthier but more productive as adults, and as a result paid more taxes. So Medicaid for kids may largely if not completely pay for itself. It\u2019s a good guess that the Affordable Care Act, by expanding Medicaid and in general by ensuring that more families have adequate health care, will similarly generate significant extra growth and revenue in the long run. Do you think the GOP will be interested in revising down estimates of the cost of Obamacare to reflect these effects?\n\nAnd what about the damage to potential output caused by cutting spending in a depressed economy? The evidence that austerity reduces output and raises unemployment is overwhelming \u2014 and there\u2019s now pretty good evidence that sustained high unemployment inflicts long-term damage on the economy\u2019s potential. So will CBO now be instructed to include these effects in its estimates?\n\nThe point is that we\u2019re not just looking at a possible mandate for using voodoo in budget estimates, we\u2019re talking about selective voodoo, which incorporates some supposed dynamic effects while ignoring others for which there is if anything stronger evidence. Tax cuts for the rich: good! Spending that makes ordinary workers more productive?
