A Republican lawmaker in North Dakota put forth legislation meant to prevent law enforcement officials from using unmanned aerial vehicles to conduct surveillance on private property without a warrant. It was transformed by fellow lawmakers into a bill allowing the police to mount Tasers, pepper spray, sound cannons and other \u201cless-than-lethal\u201d weapons on flying drones.\n\nThe legislation, House Bill 1328, was passed and signed into law earlier this year, but got little attention until this week, when a Daily Beast report pointed out the implications of the legislation: Law enforcement officers many miles away from suspects could have the authority to stun or otherwise incapacitate them.\n\nRelated: Ben Carson\u2019s Idea for Controlling the Border \u2013 Military Drone Attacks\n\nTo be clear, the fact that something like this is technically legal doesn\u2019t mean that state and local police departments will necessarily embrace the practice of remotely subduing suspects. Police officers are generally subject to local and departmental rules that can substantially limit what tactics are allowed.\n\nThe original version of the bill included language that would have barred law enforcement from mounting weapons of any kind on a drone: \u201cA state agency may not authorize the use of, including granting a permit to use, an unmanned aircraft armed with any lethal or nonlethal weapons, including firearms, pepper spray, bean bag guns, mace, and sound-based weapons,\u201d it said.\n\nSupporters of the state\u2019s police union introduced an amendment to the bill that would allow less-than-lethal weapons to be mounted on drones, according to the Daily Beast\u2019s Justin Glawe. The amended bill was ultimately passed and signed into law.\n\nRelated: Europe Faces Up to Flight Safety Threat Posed by Drones\n\nState Rep. Rick Becker this spring voiced his dismay at the changes to the bill in a public hearing, saying, \u201cIn my opinion there should be a nice, red line: Drones should not be weaponized. Period.\u201d\n\nDrones have, of course, been weaponized for years \u2014 the strikes just haven\u2019t been in the U.S. If North Dakota is taking the lead, however, that might be about to change.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "It\u2019s a classic case of unintended consequences.
