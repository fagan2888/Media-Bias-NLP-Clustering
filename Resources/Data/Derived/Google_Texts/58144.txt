NEW YORK (AP) â€” Investigators say burning incense caused a New York City fire that killed two toddler sisters.

The Fire Department of New York also said Thursday that there were no working smoke detectors in the third-floor apartment at a public housing project in the Bronx where the girls lived.

The fire Wednesday evening claimed the lives of 18-month-old Amanda Jabie and her 2-year-old sister, Jannubi.

About 10 other people, including several firefighters, were treated for minor injuries.

It wasn't immediately clear whether any charges would be filed.

This story has been corrected to show the 2-year-old's name is Jannubi, not Januvia, and the girls' last name is Jabie, not Jabir.
