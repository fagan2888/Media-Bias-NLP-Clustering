That panel was tasked with reviewing the effectiveness of arms embargos, travel bans, and asset freezes implemented by various Security Council resolutions, including Resolution 1973, which authorized a no-fly zone over Libya and was used to justify NATO intervention.\n\nOn the arms embargo, the panel complains of \u201climited resources with which to cover a two-way embargo that is breached on a regular basis and covers the entirety of Libya\u2019s territory\u201d and that the \"geographical area covered by the Panel\u2019s investigations expands every year and includes a large part of Africa, Europe and the Middle East.\u201d One of the panel\u2019s recommendations is for more experts to analyze the situations on the ground. According to the report, weapons from Libya have reached Tunisia, Algeria, Mali, Niger, Chad, Nigeria, the Central African Republic, Somalia, Egypt, and the Gaza Strip, almost a who\u2019s who of deteriorating security situations in the wider region. The U.N. reports weapons are also trafficked via Turkey, Lebanon, and Qatar.\n\nThe panel is concerned, too, that some companies doing business with gun stores in Libya don\u2019t even know about the U.N. embargo. Handguns, in particular, are in high demand, according to the report, which suggests members of security forces could be selling their handguns to civilians. Government agencies in Libya anyway rely on local armed groups for some public security, which the U.N. panel points to as an implication weapons are likely being shared.\n\nThe demand for guns among civilians shouldn\u2019t be as a surprise. The U.N. panel describes a security situation that\u2019s \u201cconsiderably deteriorated\u201d and reports continued significant increases in \u201ccarjacking, robbery, kidnappings, tribal disputes, political assassinations, armed attacks and clashes, explosions from improvised explosive devices and demonstrations.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s likely not regular Libyans worried about their personal and family security that\u2019s a primary contributing factor to the overall security situation in Libya. Instead, it's what the U.N. panel identifies as a \u201ccomplicated mix of Al-Qaida affiliated and inspired groups\u201d that have set up across Libya in the chaos that followed the 2011 intervention. The panel describes a firefight between Special Forces from the Libyan government and Ansal al-Shariah in Benghazi in November that killed nine. A campaign of assassinations and suicide bombings has followed in the city. The U.N. report also relays a raid on a Libyan military base identified as \u201ccamp 27,\u201d where the United States may have been training and supplying Libyan forces. The U.S. government responded to the panel\u2019s questions that \u201csome items that had been transferred to Libyan control were unaccounted for and presumed stolen.\u201d Libyan forces have also been mired in clashes with former Qaddafi supports and tribal groups in the southern desert.\n\nThe U.N. panel also reported on widespread non-compliance with the travel ban and asset freezes. One travel-banned Qaddafi family member traveled from Algeria to Oman, which both countries confirmed, and Oman now says it doesn\u2019t know where he is. The U.N. panel suspects the asset freeze isn\u2019t being enforced much in banks throughout the African continent, where much of the Qaddafi family\u2019s \u201cfrozen\u201d assets are believed to be.\n\nRead the entire report here (pdf).", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "UN also worried about civilians buying guns", "title": "UN Report: Security Situation in Libya 'Considerably Deteriorated,' Arms Exported Throughout Region", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2014/03/13/un-report-security-situation-in-libya-co", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/mc/ekrayewski/2014_03/mortars_UN.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Arms largely in control of non-government groups\nin a deteriorating Libya are making their way by air, land, and sea\nto countries from Nigeria to Syria, according to a United Nations\nreport by a panel of experts on the situation in Libya.
