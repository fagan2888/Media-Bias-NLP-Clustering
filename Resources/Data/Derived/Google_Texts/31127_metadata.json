soul\n\n\n\n\n\nPOST magazine asks if london has sold its soul\n\nrendering \u00a9 urbicon/new world property group\n\nall images courtesy of POST magazine\n\naccording to POST magazine, redevelopments put into play by large corporations could cause reverse gentrification and make the housing crisis in london, england even worse. in response, the australian-based publication has forwarded designboom a commentary on the subject matter:\n\nlondoners are complaining they\u2019ve been sold down the river following urbicon/new world property group\u2019s announcement this week of plans to build a 500 meter-long golden superblock stretching across the thames. the residential apartment block is part of the proposed \u2018greenwich power station redevelopment,\u2019 and the latest in a spate of new developments that have slipped under the radar in formerly sacrosanct parts of central london, and explicitly target overseas buyers.\n\n\n\nartist\u2019s impression of the power apartments\n\nrendering \u00a9 urbicon/new world property group\n\nthe announcement of the greenwich redevelopment comes on the eve of this year\u2019s london festival of architecture \u2013 themed, \u2018capital\u2019\u2013 calling into question what the city\u2019s population is really celebrating. critics warn that the greenwich proposal represents an overdevelopment of the site, but even more disconcerting is urbicon\u2019s success in securing air rights to the river thames, paving the way for increasing privatization of the cherished public asset. the company is also responsible for the 40-storey residential berburry apartments currently under construction in westminster, which when completed, will tower over big ben, supplanting the image of london\u2019s iconic national timepiece with a monument to one of britain\u2019s biggest luxury exports. urbicon CEO, moneo pauli, says that the development at greenwich will provide 3400 new homes once completed. meanwhile \u2018no more homes for millionaires\u2019 campaigners insist that, like the battersea redevelopment \u2013 which sold more than half of its net sales in the first three days to foreign investors \u2013 it will further exacerbate the housing crisis for londoners.\n\n\n\n3D rendering of berburry towers dwarfing big ben, even during construction\n\noverseas investment in central london property is primarily to blame for the runaway house prices across the city, suburbs, and beyond. even well-paid white collar citizens are unable to break into the buyers market, which is forcing up rents across the board. intense overseas interest in exclusive addresses like bishops avenue (also known as billionaires row) in north london, and now hill street, mayfair \u2013 which made headlines recently as the home of britain\u2019s most expensive mid-terraced house (\u00a390M) \u2013 has resulted in a bizarre phenomenon of \u2018reverse gentrification.\u2019 about a third of all homes along these streets are rotting, many of which were purchased some 20 years ago and have remained empty ever since. the absence of owner-occupiers has hurt local businesses, with several forced into liquidation. squatting is becoming increasingly problematic: local workers complain that they no longer feel safe and that if authorities do not act quickly, hill street will soon become a complete \u2018no-go\u2019 zone. at the same time, in a perverse and self-perpetuating cycle, developers have begun purchasing and clearing derelict properties to make way for new luxury apartments, which will be flogged back to foreign investors \u2013 oblivious to the transforming context.\n\n\n\nhill st mayfair has transformed from most expensive street in london to squatting haven\n\n\u2018the cirque apartments,\u2019 another controversial development, has begun construction on the site of the former heritage-listed london pavilion music hall. the company has defended the decision to demolish the 1885 building, citing a contextual response: replacing the actual building with a digital image of it. but the public is concerned that the use of imagery cannot be regulated, \u2018it\u2019s bad enough that we\u2019ve lost no. 1 piccadilly circus,\u2019 lamented one local retailer. \u2018they should make sure that they retain the picture of it.\u2019\n\n\n\nrendering of a new urbicon luxury development in regent street called \u2018nash apartments\u2019\n\nusing the concept of neighborhood character as their defense, urbicon promises a \u2018unique piccadilly circus experience,\u2019 where buyers can pay a premium to experience what it\u2019s like to live life in the advertisements. with each apartment clad in its own digital billboard, the developers are expected to deliver the highest returns on record, ingeniously combining their property portfolio with advertising revenue in a strategy that is sure to resonate with overseas buyers wanting their own little piece of london.\n\n\n\ncirque at piccadilly circus presents a digital fa\u00e7ade\n\nwhether the greenwich power station redevelopment will attract the same level of interest as its battersea counterpart remains to be seen, but one thing is for certain: the proposal has proven to be a timely catalyst in reigniting the debate about overseas investment in the UK housing market. given the theme of this year\u2019s london festival of architecture, and while the people have the attention of politicians, leading institutions, and built environment professionals, POST magazine believes it would be a tragedy to let the opportunity escape for a robust discussion around the effects of economic policy on the social and urban fabric of the city, and ultimately its identity.\n\n\n\nPOST magazine at the
