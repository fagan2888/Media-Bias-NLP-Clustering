(Jessica Benes / Loveland Reporter-Herald)\n\nLego Loveland Check out the Lego Loveland display of Loveland buildings and landmarks at the Lincoln Gallery, 429 N. Lincoln Ave., through May 1.\n\nThat's the Visitor's Center building, and this one looks like The Dam Store.\n\nThere's Dairy Delite and this is definitely the Rialto Theater Center.\n\nAnd that's John Metcalf's house, because he built this Lego creation that pays tribute to many of Loveland's iconic buildings and landmarks, which means he gets to live there.\n\nMetcalf built a heart-shaped landscape of Loveland's icons, which served as a centerpiece at the Loveland Chamber of Commerce annual dinner a year ago in January, which had a theme of \"Close to the Heart.\"\n\nJohn Metcalf designed a Lego scene of Loveland landmarks, including this reproduction of the Pulliam building on Cleveland Avenue in downtown Loveland. (Jessica Benes / Loveland Reporter-Herald)\n\nHe was just about to break it apart to use the pieces for other projects when he was invited to display the creation at the Lincoln Gallery for the next couple of months.\n\n\"Lego Loveland\" will be on display at the Lincoln Gallery through May 1.\n\nWhen designing the Lego display, he started by buying little light posts in bulk on eBay and figuring out how to add poles to them to display heart-shaped Lego pieces.\n\nThen, he started on the Feed and Grain building because he loves the architecture. He used it as a measurement by which the other buildings would be designed.\n\nHe added features like the Benson Park Sculpture Garden, Devil's Backbone, Foote Lagoon, the Pulliam building and McCreery House.\n\n\"I've been into Legos since I was a kid. I grew up with Legos and Star Wars action figures. That was my childhood right there,\" Metcalf said.\n\nSome of the buildings are favorite restaurants, like Pho Lan and Dairy Delite. Images of the various buildings included in the display are available on the Reporter-Herald Facebook page or Lincoln Gallery Facebook.\n\nMegan Tracy of Loveland even posted on Facebook that her boys are a couple of \"blooming master builders. They were super inspired by this and went home to build their apartment.\"\n\nJessica Benes: 970-669-5050 ext. 530, jbenes@reporter-herald.com, Twitter.com/jessicabenes.", "article_metadata": {"startDate": "2015-03-14T20:42:52-0600", "modificationDate": "2015-03-14T20:43:52-0600", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2015/0314/20150314__14RHALEGOSw~2_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Jessica Benes \n \n  Reporter-Herald Staff Writer", "description": "Lego LovelandCheck out the Lego Loveland display of Loveland buildings and landmarks at the Lincoln Gallery, 429 N.", "ag": {"canon": "LovelandReporter-Herald:article:27714724:view"}, "og": {"image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2015/0314/20150314__14RHALEGOSw~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Lego LovelandCheck out the Lego Loveland display of Loveland buildings and landmarks at the Lincoln Gallery, 429 N.", "title": "Legos pay tribute to Loveland landmarks"}, "twitter": {"domain": "reporterherald.com", "description": "Lego LovelandCheck out the Lego Loveland display of Loveland buildings and landmarks at the Lincoln Gallery, 429 N.", "title": "Legos pay tribute to Loveland landmarks", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2015/0314/20150314__14RHALEGOSw~1.jpg", "site": "@reporterherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-03-14T20:42:52-0600", "sailthru.site": "reporterherald.com", "endDate": "2025-03-14T20:40:29-0600", "sailthru.title": "Legos pay tribute to Loveland landmarks", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "byline": "By Jessica BenesReporter-Herald", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "XzsHDcJw4iXBQEYtDXFRaUAdKzxhSvxWMgXyQQNFFzg", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2015/0314/20150314__14RHALEGOSw~2.jpg", "pubDate": "2015-03-14T20:44:27-0600", "news_keywords": "News, News news, Loveland Colorado News news, Loveland Colorado news, News Loveland news, News Colorado news, US News news, world News news."}, "article_summary": "(Jessica Benes / Loveland Reporter-Herald)Lego Loveland Check out the Lego Loveland display of Loveland buildings and landmarks at the Lincoln Gallery, 429 N.
