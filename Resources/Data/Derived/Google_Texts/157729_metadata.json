It announced a 35-cent payout for the third quarter.\n\nSpeaking during a conference call Tuesday evening, Scott Nuttall, who heads KKR\u2019s global capital and asset management group, said the firm could have saved about $1 billion had it imposed the 16 cent-a-quarter rule since its listing in 2010, and put that sum to work in backing new investment ideas and revenue streams.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t think currently we are maximizing long term value for our unit holders,\u201d Henry Kravis, KKR\u2019s co-chairman and co-chief executive, said during the call.\n\nWhile KKR believes it has a better use for its gains than its public investors, not every private equity firm agrees that slashing distributions to public shareholders and buying back shares is the way to go.\n\nApollo Capital Management and Carlyle Group are taking a different approach.\n\nSpeaking during a conference call Wednesday to discuss Apollo\u2019s third-quarter financial results, Senior Managing Director Joshua Harris said, \u201cOur stock is clearly undervalued,\u201d adding that Apollo\u2019s incentive business, in particular, isn\u2019t being adequately appreciated.\n\nAs with KKR, Apollo shares dropped nearly 22% since the beginning of the year.\n\nMr. Harris said his firm has \u201ca number of potential strategic uses\u201d for its cash. He said that given only 30%\u2014a relatively low number\u2014of Apollo\u2019s stock is publicly traded, buying back shares would be \u201ccounterproductive\u201d as it will further reduce the number of shares in the public\u2019s hands.\n\nApollo distributed 35 cents a share for the third quarter, and said it intends to issue to its shareholders \u201csubstantially all of its distributable earnings\u201d after taxes and other payables.\n\nDavid Rubenstein, Carlyle\u2019s co-founder and co-chief executive, seconded Mr. Harris\u2019s view. When asked about the same topic at the company\u2019s earnings conference call on Wednesday, Mr. Rubenstein noted trading in Carlyle\u2019s shares has been \u201crelatively modest\u201d, reflective investors\u2019 less-than-hot view towards the company. He said the best thing his firm can do is \u201cto produce good distributable earnings.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe expect people to catch up to where our stock should be,\u201d Mr. Rubenstein said.\n\nCarlyle declared a distribution of 56 cents per common unit for the third quarter, bringing the payout for the first nine months to $1.78 per common unit, or a yield of 13% on the company\u2019s Tuesday 4 p.m. share price of $19.11, Mr. Rubenstein said.\n\nWrite to Amy Or at amy.or@wsj.com.
