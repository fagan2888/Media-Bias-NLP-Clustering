Paul Ryan Paul RyanRyan: Watchdog report proves Clinton \u2018cannot be trusted\u2019 Trump and Ryan to speak by phone Ryan not yet ready to endorse Trump MORE (R-Wis.).\n\nLegal Times reported Wednesday that Kevin Seifert, Ryan\u2019s chief of staff, was involved in a February 2014 accident on I-395 in Washington, D.C. Ryan owned the vehicle but was not present for the incident, the Legal Times said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe DOJ said in papers filed Monday that Ryan and Seifert are shielded from the lawsuit by sovereign immunity. That status protects lawmakers from civil suits and criminal prosecution over certain duties they fulfill as government officials.\n\nSantos Perez and Adan Bamaca Cajas, the case\u2019s plaintiffs, first filed suit against Ryan in January with Washington\u2019s Superior Court. According to their complaint, Seifert allegedly hit the car Perez was driving on Feb. 25, 2014.\n\nPerez said in the complaint he had stopped driving because of traffic. Cajas was his passenger, and both men accused Seifert of failing to drive at a \u201csafe and reasonable speed\u201d before the collision. Their suit also charges him with being a negligent driver and failing to keep a safe distance between each of their cars.\n\nBoth plaintiffs are seeking $50,000 for each of the two negligence claims in their complaint. The pair also claimed they suffered concussions and other injuries in the incident.\n\nThe DOJ\u2019s filing on Tuesday charged the lawsuit was not valid as Seifert \u201cwas acting within the scope of his employment\u201d during the crash. This would shield Ryan and his chief of staff under sovereign immunity.\n\n\"This a routine process for matters involving House employees acting in the scope of their duties and is being handled by the U.S. Department of Justice and House Counsel,\" said Robert Swift, a spokesman for Ryan.\n\nU.S. District Judge James Boasberg has been assigned the case. There are no hearings scheduled for it yet.\n\nThis story was updated at 5:17 p.m.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Justice says $100,000 lawsuit should be tossed for sovereign immunity.", "description": "Justice says $100,000 lawsuit should be tossed for sovereign immunity.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Mark Hensch", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Justice says $100,000 lawsuit should be tossed for sovereign immunity.", "title": "Justice moves to dismiss $100K lawsuit against Paul Ryan", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/235386-justice-moves-to-dismiss-lawsuit-against-paul-ryan", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/ryanpaul_020514getty_0_0.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-03-11T17:17:20-04:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2015-03-11T17:17-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/235386-justice-moves-to-dismiss-lawsuit-against-paul-ryan", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2015-03-11T16:36-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Ian Swanson", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-11T16:36:37-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-11T17:17:20-04:00"}, "keywords": ",Kevin Seifert, Paul Ryan,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/235386-justice-moves-to-dismiss-lawsuit-against-paul-ryan", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Justice says $100,000 lawsuit should be tossed for sovereign immunity.", "card": "summary", "title": "Justice moves to dismiss $100K lawsuit against Paul Ryan"}, "dcterms.title": "Justice moves to dismiss $100K lawsuit against Paul Ryan"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaf2b\"", "article_summary": "The Department of Justice (DOJ) on Tuesday asked that Washington\u2019s federal district court dismiss a $100,000 lawsuit filed against Rep.
