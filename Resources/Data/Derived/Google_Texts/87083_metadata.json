They derive 50% of their profits from the 4% of the adult population who are problem or addicted gamblers. The average casino may temporarily bring increased economic activity, but this is just money transferred from one party to another; it is not true economic development.\n\nCasinos cause social disruption, such as the lost trust of children in their gambling-addicted parents, divorce and suicide. I urge my fellow New Yorkers to vote no in November. Elizabeth Shafer\n\nDoing their job\n\nManhattan: Juan Gonzalez accuses a charter school of ignoring a student\u2019s special needs (\u201cSuccess at what price? Aug. 28), but the facts show just the opposite. Recognizing a severe need that it was not equipped to meet, the school followed its legal duty to ask the city for a more appropriate placement for the child. Such conversations happen at district schools every day, which is why the city has an entire district devoted to students with the most intensive needs \u2014 and pays for thousands of students to attend specialized private schools. Charter schools have a responsibility to serve a wide range of students, but no public school can offer every service. It serves no one to suggest otherwise. James Merriman, CEO, N.Y.C. Charter School Center\n\nFreedom is ringing\n\nBrooklyn: My black co-workers don\u2019t worry about reparations. They struggle to provide for their families, pay bills and put their kids through school. They are equal and fully immersed in the American dream of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, accomplished through hard work and perseverance. Those who seek excuses about decades-old injustices might wonder why many have succeeded and they have not. Remembering that the fault sometimes \u201clies not in our stars but in ourselves\u201d might help. Heaven, this ain\u2019t. But if we wish to say that Martin Luther King\u2019s dream has come true, then we have reached the mountaintop for some time now. David DiBello\n\nThe march before the march\n\nScarsdale, N.Y.: Although the 1963 March on Washington is heralded today, little is said about its predecessor, the Youth March for Integrated Schools (on Oct. 25, 1958, and April 18, 1959). To see the nation\u2019s capital for the first time was quite an awesome experience. However, after speeches by Harry Bellafonte and others, and a long march across Constitution Ave., I was very disappointed that President Dwight Eisenhower did not come out to greet us. Phyllis C. Murray\n\nOut of step\n\nBrooklyn: Why is it that for 40 years, the March for Life has never gotten one-tenth the publicity of the March on Washington? We know that Martin Luther King Jr. would have led the March for Life, because he believed every life is worth respecting. Frances Ruocco\n\nSorry situation\n\nStaten Island: I would love to know who hired Al Sharpton to run anything. What\u2019s on his resume \u2014 race baiting, Tawana Brawley, tax evasion? Still, he gets away with it because of his skin color. And Paula Deen is still apologizing. Anthony Liverano\n\nGo with Joe\n\nStaten Island: In my opinion, all the Democratic candidates for mayor are career politicians seeking to advance themselves. New York City has pretty much thrived under Republican administrations. Joe Lhota is the most qualified to be mayor. Let\u2019s not go back to pre-Giuliani days. Frances Baldassarre\n\nThe better half\n\nOzone Park: With the plethora of scandals occurring in our government, it\u2019s time for women to take over. Ladies, get a chastity belt for your husbands and restore some dignity to our country. Josephine Ambrosio\n\nHow to bear the loss\n\nElmont, L.I.: Re \u201cIt\u2019s eternal hibernation for Gus\u201d (Aug. 29): How do you bid farewell to a guy you\u2019ve known in passing for 20-plus years? A friend who brought a smile to your face every time you encountered him, never asking for anything in return? A buddy that simply made your day. You say, \u201cGus, thanks for the fond memories \u2014 and may you rest in peace.\u201d I\u2019ll miss you. Derek K. Evans\n\nScan-dal\n\nBrooklyn: I am a three-year cancer survivor. Since the onset of the disease, my doctors have sent me for PET scans every three months. Because of these scans, new concerns were discovered in the early stages, and again my life was saved. In August, the imaging facility informed me that Medicare will now only pay for three scans in a lifetime for one disease. This ruling, I believe, is due to Obamacare. I sincerely hope no one in our President\u2019s family needs a PET scan to save his or her life. Sandy Seidenberg\n\nThe pay is too darn low\n\nCollege Point: All we need is for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to get corporations who are sitting on piles of cash to increase wages for all Americans. This will end the recession by stimulating consumption \u2014 and begin the long road to income balance. Frank N. Sforza\n\nBetter luck next time\n\nManhattan: I want to thank you for sending me four tickets to the Staten Island Yankees. I gave them to a young friend\u2019s mother so they could go that night. I\u2019ve gotten so many thanks and kisses. Next time you have a contest, I hope I win what I would like \u2014 a ride on the Ferris wheel. (I\u2019m 781/2). Gloria W. Geddie\n\nThe rule of law\n\nFlushing: My sincere congratulations to Federal Judge Shira Scheindlin for ruling that stop-and-frisk is unconstitutional. In her judicial wisdom, she has upheld the inviolability if the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. Hyman Auslander\n\nColor blindness\n\nWhitestone: Voicers Joyce Blondo and Paul McGuiness argue that stop-and-frisk actually helps prevent crime, and that the judge who ruled on it was way off the mark. Study after study has indicated that most of those stopped and frisked have no weapon on them, and those who do are a minuscule minority. I don\u2019t understand how anyone in this city does not see \u2014 unless, of course, they are white or racist or have never been the victim of an unnecessary stop-and-frisk \u2014 that this program has been targeted at young black and Latino males. I\u2019m taking an educated guess that almost no one has been stopped and frisked in Whitestone. Why not? There is plenty of drug use and drug dealing in lily-white Whitestone. Jan Finney\n\nDoctoring the Rockaways\n\nAlbany: News that the Rockaway Peninsula may lose its last hospital (\u201cA very grim prognosis,\u201d Aug. 14) echoes the financial troubles faced by hospitals across the state. One factor common in many closures is the substantial cost of medical liability insurance, largely driven by lawsuits. New York providers pay the most in the nation for insurance premiums, despite their excellent safety records. Reasonable reforms, such as limits for noneconomic damages and higher standards for medical experts, could reduce lawsuits and prevent future hospital closures. Phoebe E. Stonbely, Lawsuit Reform Alliance of New York\n\nCapice?\n\nHicksville, L.I.: In a recent replay on TV of a movie I still enjoy, \u201cThe Godfather,\u201d Marlon Brando is talking to his son Al Pacino, saying he had hopes of him becoming a senator or governor. Al Pacino casually says in Italian, \u201cAnother pezzonovante.\u201d Are there any old-time Italians still alive who can tell me what that phrase means? Dominick Battaglia\n\nQuixotic politics\n\nSouth Ozone Park: To Voicer Patricia Maggiulli: What a beautiful thought! I can\u2019t help reminiscing about the song from \u201cMan of La Mancha,\u201d \u201cThe Impossible Dream.\u201d As long as we have a less-than-informed, partisan electorate who continually elect the dregs from the political pool, of the ilk of Mark Sanford and Charles Rangel, we will never realize our quest.
