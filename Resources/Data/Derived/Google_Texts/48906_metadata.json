John Katko says he wants to set the record straight: He will vote to repeal the law as soon as the GOP comes up with a viable replacement.\n\n\"During the course of my campaign I made a pledge to my constituents that I would repeal the Affordable Care Act only if there was a replacement ready to go,\" Katko told syracuse.com in the video above. \"Unfortunately, there isn't one ready to go, so I have to stick with my campaign promise. That doesn't mean I am for the Affordable Care Act. I am not.\"\n\nKatko, R-Camillus, was among only three Republicans to break with his party on the repeal vote, which passed the House 239-186. Democrats were unanimous in their opposition.\n\nTwo other Republican freshmen sided with Democrats on the 56th Republican attempt to repeal, roll back or undermine parts the health care law. Like Katko, the two GOP congressmen said they want to repeal the law, but only when a replacement is ready.\n\nRep. Bruce Poliquin, R-Maine, told the Capitol Hill publication CQ Roll Call that he wants \"to see a tangible, free-market replacement and this bill does not give us that. I need to see how we're gonna fix this, and not just be someone who votes for the 56th time to repeal this. Show me a fix, and you'll have my support.\"\n\nRep. Robert Dold, R-Illinois, the third GOP \"no\" vote, also said he couldn't support \"a symbolic vote\" without a replacement bill.\n\nErin O'Connor, speaking for Kakto, said his Syracuse office received about a dozen phone calls Wednesday morning from constituents who wanted to talk about his vote. O'Connor said most of the callers said they appreciated Katko's candor in explaining his position about keeping a campaign promise.\n\nContact Mark Weiner anytime: Email | Twitter | Facebook | 571-970-3751", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Affordable Care Act, CNYPolitics, Health, Health Care, Health News, John Katko, Obamacare, Top News, news", "title": "Why Rep.
