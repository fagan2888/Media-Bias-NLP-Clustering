Health Benefit Exchange\u2019s use of local tax dollars in an effort designed to allow more than 12,000 members of Congress, staffers and their dependents to participate in the Small Business Exchange.\n\nThat figure represents approximately 86 percent of the 14,289 people enrolled in the district\u2019s Small Business Exchange between Oct. 1 2013 and Sept. 9, 2014, according to Judicial Watch.\n\n\u201cIt is an abuse of district taxpayers to use D.C. funds to subsidize illegal health insurance for Congress,\u201d said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton. \u201cIt is unlawful and unethical for district officials to use local dollars to participate in Congress\u2019s Obamacare fraud.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit \u201cseeks to prevent at least $77 million in District funds from being used to help Congress violate the restrictions imposed on it by the Obamacare law,\u201d a Judicial Watch statement said.\n\n\u201cSince November 2013, the Exchange Authority has allowed the U.S. House of Representatives \u2026 and the U.S. Senate \u2026 to use the Small Business Exchange to provide health insurance to some (but not all) congressional employees, including members of Congress and these employees\u2019 spouses and dependents,\u201d Judicial Watch\u2019s appeal said.\n\n\u201cAt all relevant times, defendants have known that the House and the Senate were participating in the Small Business Exchange to provide health insurance to some (but not all) congressional employees.\u201d\n\nThe original lawsuit was filed Oct. 15, 2014 on behalf of D.C. resident Kirby Vining. A lower court dismissed the case on Feb. 25 after the D.C. government argued that the U.S. Office of Personnel Management could override city law, which doesn\u2019t allow Congress to obtain benefits on the exchange\n\n\u201cCongress authored the law and is going to rather questionable lengths to avoid compliance with the law it drafted,\u201d Vining said.\n\nWashington\u2019s law only allows small business with 50 or fewer full-time employees to participate in the exchange.\n\nJudicial Watch exposed that the House and the Senate applications for the exchange claimed that each chamber only had 45 staff each, though Congress employs around 20,000 people. The applications also listed the legislative branch as \u201clocal/state governments.\u201d\n\nThe names of the applications\u2019 signatories were blacked out.\n\nAlso, Republican Sen. David Vitter introduced a bill in July that would require the president, vice president, members of Congress, and political appointees to purchase health insurance through an exchange without a federal subsidy. Vitter\u2019s legislation followed his investigation into Congress\u2019 registration as a small business.\n\nSimilarly, the Council for Citizens Against Government Waste filed a complaint with the Senate Ethics Committee in June that was signed by Judicial Watch and eight other watchdog groups.\n\nCCAGW and 15 more conservative groups also asked House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform Chairman Republican Jason Chaffetz in a June 15 letter to investigate Congress\u2019 applications.\n\nFollow Ethan on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
