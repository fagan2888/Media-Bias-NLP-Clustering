You know what they say about men with big feet. Well apparently “they” are wrong. In a video for the YouTube channel “Mental Floss,” Dr. Aaron Carroll explains that the correlation between foot size and penis length is unsubstantiated by science.

“There have been many studies on this, amazingly enough, and they fail to find any link between the size of a man’s shoes and the size of a man’s stretched or erect penis,” said Dr. Carroll, who is a Professor of Pediatrics and Assistant Dean for Research Mentoring at Indiana University School of Medicine. “There’s also no relationship between the size of his penis and the size of his hands, or ears, or anything else for that matter. Looking at his shoes will only tell you about his taste in footwear.”

In the rest of the clip, entitled “20 Misconceptions About Sex,” Dr. Carroll debunks myths and misconceptions that most of us have heard (and believed) since middle school: Is sex really great exercise? Can women have wet dreams? Can things like sexual position at conception influence the gender of your child? Do men really think about sex every seven seconds? Does the birth control pill cause women to gain weight?

The answers to all of those questions, and more, are in the video below:
