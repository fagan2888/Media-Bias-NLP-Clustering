The strategy is very clear. We\u2019ll do what we can from the air. We will support the Iraqi security forces, the Kurds, and ultimately over time, the moderate opposition in Syria to be able to control territory and take the fight to ISIL,\u201d Rice told NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere has been no recommendation from the American military commanders, either on the ground or here in Washington, that the United States put any ground combat forces into Iraq. That has not come up the chain to anyone at the White House and I don\u2019t anticipate that it will,\u201d Rice said. \u201cThe president has been very plain that this is not a campaign that requires, or even would benefit from, American ground troops in combat again.\u201d\n\nRice\u2019s defense of the American strategy came as many question its effectiveness as the Islamic State makes advances in Anbar province, a region that neighbors Baghdad, and Kobani, a Kurdish town in northern Syria, despite weeks of US-led airstrikes.\n\nWhile Rice insisted that there would not be any U.S. ground troops, or recommendations for them, statements by current and former military advisors suggested the comment was premature.\n\nJoint Chiefs of Staff General Martin Dempsey pointed to Mosul as an instance where U.S. ground troops may be recommended.\n\nABC\u2019s Martha Raddatz asked Dempsey, \u201cWould we be more effective against ISIS if we had U.S. troops on the ground spotting targets?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah. There will be circumstances when the answer to that question will likely be yes, but I haven\u2019t encountered one right now,\u201d Dempsey said.\n\n\u201cMosul will likely be the decisive battle in the ground campaign at some point in the future. When [the Iraqi Security Forces] are ready to go back on the offensive. My instinct at this point is that that will require a different kind of advising and assisting because of the complexity of that fight.\u201d\n\nFormer Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta seemed to broadly echo that sentiment on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d and warned against taking options off the table.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always felt that the President of the United States ought to keep every option available in dealing with this kind of enemy\u2026 I think you want to protect every possible option because we are dealing with a very resilient enemy and the only way you deal with a resilient enemy is with flexibility, adaptability, and the kind of determination that we\u2019re going to need if we\u2019re ever going to win this war.\u201d\n\nThe overall strategy will take time, Panetta noted, but airstrikes alone will not win the war against ISIS.\n\n\u201cThese airstrikes can help to a degree, I think they\u2019ve helped kind of stifle some of the momentum in ISIS, but to make these airstrikes work you\u2019ve got to have information on targets and you\u2019ve got to be able to pinpoint where the enemy location is and that, frankly, is going to take time.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to have boots on the ground,\u201d Panetta continued, \u201cmaybe it doesn\u2019t have to be American boots on the ground, but you have got to have people on the ground who can identify targets and who can help us develop the kind of effective airstrikes that are going to be needed if we\u2019re going to be able to undermine, destroy this vicious enemy that we\u2019re dealing with.\u201d\n\nRice defended the air campaign, arguing that it was in the early stages, but \u201coff to a strong start.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur efforts have various, different lines of effort, as we call them. On the one hand, we\u2019re trying to build up the capacity of the Iraqis, which means the Iraqi army, the Kurds \u2013 the Peshmerga inside of Iraq\u2026 we\u2019re building up that capacity and we have seen some success in that regard. On the Syrian side, we also have a longer-term challenge of supporting the moderate opposition, and giving them, while they have great will, greater capacity to fight Assad and to fight ISIL.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, this is going to take time,\u201d Rice continued. \u201cOur air campaign is off to a strong start\u2026 it can\u2019t be judged by merely what happens in one particular town or in one particular region.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "On Sunday, National Security Advisor Susan Rice said the United States would not reevaluate the strategy to \u201cdegrade and destroy\u201d the Islamic State", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "On Sunday, National Security Advisor Susan Rice said the United States would not reevaluate the strategy to \u201cdegrade and destroy\u201d the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS or ISIL), despite i", "title": "Rice Defends US Islamic State Strategy", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/national-security/rice-defends-us-islamic-state-strategy/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Susan-Rice-not-pleased-AP-150x150.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "On Sunday, National Security Advisor Susan Rice said the United States would not reevaluate the stra", "creator": "@ellisonbarber", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Susan-Rice-not-pleased-AP-150x150.jpg", "title": "Rice Defends US Islamic State Strategy", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID", "pages": 282024895179874}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Joint Chiefs of Staff General Martin Dempsey pointed to Mosul as an instance where U.S. ground troops may be recommended.\n\u201cMosul will likely be the decisive battle in the ground campaign at some point in the future.\nWhile Rice insisted that there would not be any U.S. ground troops, or recommendations for them, statements by current and former military advisors suggested the comment was premature.\nThat has not come up the chain to anyone at the White House and I don\u2019t anticipate that it will,\u201d Rice said.\nABC\u2019s Martha Raddatz asked Dempsey, \u201cWould we be more effective against ISIS if we had U.S. troops on the ground spotting targets?\u201d\u201cYeah."}
