The latest round of talks, which started last autumn, have been extended to July 1.\n\nThis time the impasse has been variously ascribed to the number of centrifuges Iran is allowed to spin, the speed at which US sanctions are lifted, and the duration that it will be treated differently from any other signatory to the Non Proliferation Treaty (NPT) vis-\u00e0-vis inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nOstensibly these negotiations are about securing a safer world, but they are just as much about winning a political narrative to sell to stubborn political constituencies in Washington and Tehran. The US needs the story to be about how it bent Iran\u2019s will, while Iran is pursuing a narrative that it will not be bent.\n\nSo what are the factors putting a deal out of reach?\n\nHardliners on both sides\n\nThe political systems in both Iran and the US have hardliners back home who oppose any deal between the two nations. The enmity felt by the respective hardliners, rooted in war and revolution, is real and deep. But hardliners in the US, principally the large pro-Israel congressional constituency and their donors, exercise much more power over the fate of the negotiations than their Iranian counterparts.\n\nSupreme Leader Ali Khamenei exercises considerable control over the most powerful sections of the Iranian right, various parliamentary conservative alliances and key paramilitary groups. Although he must assuage the spoilers with a sellable political narrative, they wield no real leverage over him.\n\nUnlike Obama, Khamenei owes little to his noisy hardliners constitutionally. The specter of a GOP-led Congress (which sits in February) is a clear and present danger to Obama\u2019s ability to give Iran the minimum that it needs from a deal, which, according to the Iranian press, was the principal reason a deal couldn\u2019t be sealed on Nov. 17.\n\nSanctions\n\nThe minimum Iran needs from a deal is significant and permanent sanctions relief. America says its sanctions brought Iran to the negotiating table in the first place, while Iran contends that it came to the table because the US dropped its erstwhile insistence of \u201czero enrichment\u201d for Iran\u2019s nuclear program.\n\nEither way, the sanctions have been a major stumbling block for the talks. The sanctions that have been doing the most damage to Iran\u2019s economy (2012\u2019s Comprehensive Iran Sanctions Act, and 1996\u2019s repeatedly rolled-over Iran and Libya Sanctions Act) were signed into law by Congress and therefore need Congress to lift them. Obama can waive sanctions for 120 days at a time by presidential order and keep Congress at bay by vetoing new sanctions legislation, but he will need Congress, which will be dominated from February by a GOP looking to deny the president a legacy.\n\nIran knows this and is wont to agree to irreversible legislative changes on its own \u2014 for example signing up to the Additional Protocol of the NPT for greater inspections \u2014 without confidence that Congress will help Obama legislatively with his side of the bargain.\n\nIran has learned this from experience. In 2005, President Hassan Rohani, then Iran\u2019s lead nuclear negotiator, signed up to the Paris Agreement with European powers to temporarily freeze its nuclear program on the understanding that its NPT rights \u2014 to pursue a peaceful nuclear program \u2014 would be recognized and Europe would veto a UN Security Council resolution for which the US was pushing.\n\nEurope never lived up to its side of the bargain and Iran elected a president who ordered Iran\u2019s centrifuges to be turned back on. Under Mahmoud Ahmadinejad\u2019s premiership Iran increased the number of centrifuges seven-fold.\n\nRussian gas, Chinese goods\n\nThe Iranian, US and European negotiating teams want a deal for its stated aims: sanctions relief and a theoretical reduction in the proliferation risk. Europe and Iran \u2014 and to a lesser extent the US \u2014 may also reap commercial rewards by a lifting of sanctions and the opening up of Iranian markets to European firms, particularly in the fields of oil, gas, petrochemicals and pharmaceuticals.\n\nThe West and Iran also hope to make geo-strategic gains as a deal could catalyze greater cooperation diplomatically and militarily against shared interests in the Middle East, principally the stabilization of Iraq and Syria. But questions remain over whether Russia and China are honest participants in the negotiations because they both have much to gain from the status quo of a sanctioned and isolated Iran.\n\nThe integration of Iran into the world economy would mean a tough competitor for Russia\u2019s gas export business to both Europe and China. It would also give Iran\u2019s importers greater choice than China for consumer goods, which currently enjoy a huge market share in Iran.\n\nWhile the US is often seen as the most intractable negotiating partner in the talks, many observers, including Rohani\u2019s own aide, have said that China and Russia are in fact the biggest spoilers to a deal.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A final deal between Iran and the West is being held up by hardliners, quarrels over sanctions and even Russian gas.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "MintPress News Desk & Arron Merat", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "A final deal between Iran and the West is being held up by hardliners, quarrels over sanctions and even Russian gas.", "title": "There's More Stalling A Nuclear Deal With Iran Than You Might Think", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/theres-more-stalling-a-nuclear-deal-with-iran-than-you-might-think/199655/", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Mideast-Iran-Medical-_Webf-1.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-12-10T10:24:25-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A final deal between Iran and the West is being held up by hardliners, quarrels over sanctions and even Russian gas.", "creator": "@MintPressNews", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/AP742647293086.jpg", "title": "There's More Stalling A Nuclear Deal With Iran Than You Might Think", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Foreign Affairs", "tag": "un security council", "published_time": "2014-12-06T05:00:16-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-10T10:24:25-05:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc1a3\"", "article_summary": "There\u2019s More Stalling A Nuclear Deal With Iran Than You Might ThinkA final deal between Iran and the West is being held up by hardliners, quarrels over sanctions and even Russian gas.\nHardliners on both sidesThe political systems in both Iran and the US have hardliners back home who oppose any deal between the two nations.\nAmerica says its sanctions brought Iran to the negotiating table in the first place, while Iran contends that it came to the table because the US dropped its erstwhile insistence of \u201czero enrichment\u201d for Iran\u2019s nuclear program.\nSanctionsThe minimum Iran needs from a deal is significant and permanent sanctions relief.\nIt would also give Iran\u2019s importers greater choice than China for consumer goods, which currently enjoy a huge market share in Iran."}
