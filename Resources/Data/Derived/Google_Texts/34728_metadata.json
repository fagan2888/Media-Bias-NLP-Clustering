Police later identified the shop as a skate store called Zumiez.\n\nThe employees were identified by police as Brianna Benlolo, 21, of College Park, Md., and Tyler Johnson, 25, of Mount Airy, Md. The male shooter, whose body was found nearby, had a shotgun and \u201ca large amount of ammunition on and about him,\u201d McMahon said.\n\nInvestigators said they have tentatively identified the shooter but did not release his name. Officials were planning to issue an update at 9:30 a.m. ET on Sunday.\n\nPolice also said they disabled crude attempts at explosive devices inside the shooter's bag.\n\n\"A search of the shooter's bag found inside the store revealed two crude devices that appeared to be an attempt at making explosives using fireworks. Both were disabled,\" a police statement read, adding that the mall would be closed Sunday.\n\nThe victims were found inside and directly outside of the shop, which is located above the food court, McMahon said. \u201cThere were a lot of people very close to where this happened,\u201d said Howard County Executive Ken Ulman.\n\nTonya Broughton was enjoying a spa day at the mall with a friend. \u201cThe only thing I heard was all the people running and screaming and saying \u2018There\u2019s a shooter! There\u2019s a shooter,\u201d she told The Associated Press.\n\nThe two women huddled inside a Victoria\u2019s Secret store with facial masks still smeared on their faces.\n\nMcMahon said once investigators were done searching the deceased suspect to assure there were no explosives on his body, they would work on identifying him.\n\nA shooting at a shopping mall outside of Baltimore kills three and has police searching for a motive.\n\n\u201cWhen we have that, perhaps we will have a better idea of what the motive is,\u201d he said.\n\nTwo federal law enforcement officials told NBC News the incident was a domestic situation, not a random shooting. However, McMahon said that Howard County Police \u201cdo not know yet whether this is a domestic incident.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe tactical teams went through every inch of the mall and it has been cleared,\u201d said Howard County Executive Ken Ulman at a news conference five hours after the shooting. The mall would remain closed through Saturday night, police said.\n\nThe nearby Howard County General Hospital told police they were treating a victim who was shot in the foot. Four other people with \u201cminor injuries that were not directly related to the shooting\u201d were transported to the hospital, police said. NBC Washington reported that one of the injured had a twisted ankle, and two people suffered seizures.\n\nAll five patients were released from the hospital early on Saturday night, WBAL reported.\n\nPolice said the first 911 call reporting a shooting at the mall was received at 11:15 a.m. Officers arrived at the scene within two minutes, McMahon said.\n\nMcMahon said shoppers followed instructions from mall security to seek shelter.\n\n\u201cThey have done what we have encouraged them to do in one of these situations,\u201d McMahon said, adding that he had not heard reports of stampedes. Police had staged drills will mall staff in the past to prepare for an emergency situation, he said.\n\nThose still inside the mall were evacuated to a movie theater and allowed to leave from there if they did not witness the shooting, Howard County Fire Dispatch calls indicated. The movie theater is separate from the mall, on the opposite side of a parking lot, according to Mall in Columbia maps.\n\nA witness told NBC Washington that she heard what she thought was \u201csomething being dropped,\u201d but then realized it was gunshots. \"They just kept shooting and it didn't stop,\" she said.\n\nEvan Vucci / AP Shoppers are evacuated by police after a shooting Saturday at a malll in Columbia, Md.\n\n\u201cIt was a busy day,\u201d a mall employee told NBC News. \u201cPeople started running through our store,\u201d which is at the opposite end of the mall from where the shooting happened, she said.\n\nShe said associates and customers sheltered inside a stockroom for over 90 minutes before they got in contact with police who told them they could leave.\n\n\u201cYou really just don\u2019t expect for something like this to happen in our community,\u201d she said.\n\nGov. Martin O'Malley praised the quick actions of Howard County police and first responders in a statement.\"\n\nOn behalf of the people of Maryland, I want to express my deepest condolences to the families of the victims and all those affected by this senseless act of violence,\" O\u2019Malley said.\n\nZumies CEO Rick Brooks also conveyed sympathies. \u201cThe Zumiez team is a tight knit community and all of our hearts go out to Brianna and Tyler\u2019s families,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe have literally no violence in the whole county, this is our quota for 2014 basically,\u201d said Columbia resident, David Hobby. \u201cThe mall is in town center so it is the focal point for Columbia.\u201d he said adding, \u201cOn a cold Saturday, this is where everyone would be.\u201d\n\nThere have been several violent incidents at U.S. shopping centers in recent months.\n\nA woman and a man were killed in a shooting outside a San Diego mall early on Christmas Eve, and earlier in the month a man leaving an upscale New Jersey mall was shot and killed during a carjacking.\n\nAt a different New Jersey mall in November, a gunman opened fire and later holed up in a back room before shooting himself in the head. No one else was injured.\n\nIn a December 2012 shooting at an Oregon mall, police said a gunman appeared to be on a \"mission\" to kill. Two people died and a third injured when the man opened fire with an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle inside the mall teeming with holiday shoppers.\n\nIn addition to those incidents in the U.S., an upscale mall in Nairobi, Kenya, was targeted in September, when al Qaeda-linked militants carried out an attack that killed 67 people and injured up to 200. The attack \u2014 which the Islamic terrorist group al-Shabab claimed responsibility for \u2014 lasted four days.\n\nNBC News' Pete Williams and Mike Kosnar contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Two employees of a skate shop were killed Saturday when a gunman armed with a shotgun and \u201ca large amount of ammunition\u201d opened fire in the store in a shopping mall in Columbia, Md., near Baltimore, before apparently killing himself,", "title": "Two store employees, gunman dead in Maryland mall shooting - U.S. News", "og": {"site_name": "NBC News", "description": "Two employees of a skate shop were killed Saturday when a gunman armed with a shotgun and &ldquo;a large amount of ammunition&rdquo; opened fire in the store in a shopping mall in Columbia, Md., near Baltimore, before apparently killing himself,", "title": "Two store employees, gunman dead in Maryland mall shooting", "url": "http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2014/01/25/22444239-two-store-employees-gunman-dead-in-maryland-mall-shooting", "image": "http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/MSNBC/Components/Photo/_new/14-125-mall-shooting-1340.jpg", "type": "article"}, "contentId": 22444239, "section": "{\"domainName\":\"usnews\",\"displayName\":\"U.S. News\",\"avatar\":\"http:\\/\\/m.static.newsvine.com\\/servista\\/imagesizer?file=null-null241F51EE-A064-FA2F-4165-00271F9FF35C.jpg&width=30\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/usnews.nbcnews.com\\/\",\"type\":\"group\",\"ass\":\"\",\"groupId\":\"4952\",\"articleCount\":\"13904\",\"seedCount\":\"13056\",\"memberCount\":\"54\",\"description\":\"Stories from NBC reporters around the country.\",\"createDate\":1189092600,\"groupType\":null,\"groupTypeId\":\"5\",\"blessed\":0,\"lastPub\":1464194694,\"isEnabled\":1}", "author": "U.S. News", "trackData": "{\"section\":\"US news\",\"subSection\":\"usnewsfranchise\",\"sitePageId\":\"a22444239\",\"headline\":\"Two store employees, gunman dead in Maryland mall shooting\",\"pageSource\":\"U.S. News\",\"typeName\":\"Story\",\"byline\":\"U.S. News\",\"tags\":[],\"seedSource\":\"\"}", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"asap\", \"load_pers\":\"1\"}", "cip": "165.254.127.100", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "date": "May 25, 2016, 10:45 am", "server": "web03", "nv": {"contentId": 22444239, "contentType": "n"}, "canonical": "http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2014/01/25/22444239-two-store-employees-gunman-dead-in-maryland-mall-shooting"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5a68\"", "article_summary": "Jim Watson / AFP - Getty Images Maryland State Police patrol a mall in Columbia, Md., after a fatal shooting Saturday.\n\u201cThere were a lot of people very close to where this happened,\u201d said Howard County Executive Ken Ulman.\nIn a December 2012 shooting at an Oregon mall, police said a gunman appeared to be on a \"mission\" to kill.\nEvan Vucci / AP Shoppers are evacuated by police after a shooting Saturday at a malll in Columbia, Md.\nMartin O'Malley praised the quick actions of Howard County police and first responders in a statement.\""}
