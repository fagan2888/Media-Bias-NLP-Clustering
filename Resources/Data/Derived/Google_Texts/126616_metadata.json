Researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have found that by diagnosing people with HIV and providing these people with the right care and treatment, we can prevent over 90 percent of new HIV transmissions.\n\n\u201cBy quantifying where HIV transmissions occur at each stage of care, we can identify when and for whom prevention and treatment efforts will have the most impact,\u201d Dr. Jonathan Mermin, director of CDC\u2019s National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention, said in a statement. \u201cWe could prevent the vast majority of new infections tomorrow by improving the health of people living with HIV today.\u201d\n\nMermin and his colleagues have published the first U.S. estimates for the number of HIV transmissions from people at five consecutive stages of care in 2009: people who are unaware of their infection, people who are retained in care, and people who control their virus with treatment. Researchers used three national HIV databases, including the CDC\u2019s Medical Mointoring Project, National HIV Surveillance System, and National HIV Behavioral Surveillance System.\n\nIndicating just how important HIV testing is, the research team found that 30 percent of new HIV infections were transmitted via people who had no idea they were infected. Clearly people who have been diagnosed with HIV were less likely to transmit their infection. People who were not prescribed antiretroviral treatment, but were receiving ongoing HIV care, were 51.8 percent less likely to transmit their infection compared to those who were diagnosed but not receiving care.\n\n\u201cPositive or negative, an HIV test opens the door to prevention. For someone who is positive, it can be the gateway to care and the signal to take steps to protect partners from infection. For someone who tests negative, it can be a direct link to important prevention services to help them stay HIV-free,\u201d said Dr. Eugene McCray, director of CDC\u2019s Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention. \u201cAt CDC, we\u2019re working hard to make testing as simple and accessible as possible.\u201d\n\nCompared to people who did not know they were infected with HIV, people who were using treatment to successfully control their HIV were 94 percent less likely to transmit the virus. Unfortunately, only 30 percent of people with HIV have reached this important step in HIV care. CDC researchers stress the importance of a multi-faceted HIV care program, which includes antiretroviral therapy, risk reduction counseling on how to protect sexual partners, screening and treatment for other STDs, as well as treatment for mental health and drug abuse.\n\nSource: Skarbinski J, Rosenberg E, Mermin J, et al.
