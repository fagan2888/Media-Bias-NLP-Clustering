DALLAS—GuideStone Financial Resources will release its annual tax guide for ministers in two phases.

The Federal Reporting Requirements for Churches section is available now by clicking here. This section details filing requirements for Forms W-2 and 1099. It also includes information on filing requirements many churches will need to comply with the Affordable Care Act.

The remainder of the annual 2016 tax return preparation and dederal reporting guide, Ministers’ Tax Guide for 2015 Returns, with its step-by-step filing instructions of personal ministers’ taxes, will be available online by the end of January.

GuideStone participants may receive the free guide by clicking here. They also can request a free printed copy by calling (888)98-GUIDE, (888) 984-8433.

Richard Hammar, a noted CPA, attorney and widely published author who specializes in legal and tax issues for ministers, wrote the guide again this year. GuideStone’s staff edits the material to ensure that it addresses the detailed tax issues directly affecting pastors.

“Each year, we hear from so many pastors and other ministers about the help the Ministers’ Tax Guide is for them and their families as they navigate tax filing, either on their own or alongside their tax preparer,” GuideStone President O.S. Hawkins said.

“It is a joy to hear from so many pastors who tell us how thankful they are for this guide and how much it helps them. This free guide is part of the ministry of GuideStone, and we are pleased to bring it to our participants.”
