Although Billboard ran an evenhanded overview that was cautiously optimistic, Gawker had some rather harsh words for the service: \u201cEven the free trial I received felt like a ripoff.\u201d\n\nUnsurprisingly, musicians themselves have been the most vocal naysayers of the artist-owned system. Mumford & Sons responded with \u201cfart noises\u201d when Tidal was mentioned in a Daily Beast interview, while producer/engineer Steve Albini in Vulture compared the service to a \u201cbudget version of [Neil Young\u2019s high-quality music player] Pono.\u201d Death Cab for Cutie\u2019s Ben Gibbard, meanwhile, expressed his own concerns in a separate Daily Beast interview.\n\n\u201cI think they totally blew it by bringing out a bunch of millionaires and billionaires and propping them up onstage and then having them all complain about not being paid,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was a wonderful opportunity squandered to highlight what this service would mean for artists who are struggling and to make a plea to people\u2019s hearts and pocketbooks to pay a little more for this service that was going to pay these artists a more reasonable streaming rate. And they didn\u2019t do it. That\u2019s why this thing is going to fail miserably.\u201d\n\nIndeed, as stories continue to roll in from musicians receiving paltry payouts from streaming music services\u2013for example, Portishead\u2019s Geoff Barrow just reported he received 1,700 pounds (or $2,500), for 34 million streams\u2013it\u2019s hard to be optimistic that this platform is going to be any different than Spotify, Rdio, YouTube and their ilk. First and foremost, Tidal doesn\u2019t have a free or freemium level: The \u201cpremium\u201d level is $9.99 per month, while the option with high-fidelity audio is $19.99 per month. That\u2019s immediately a strike against Tidal, especially because the pop, rock and hip-hop stars behind the service are all 1 percenters who aren\u2019t hurting for money. The gesture itself\u2013the richest musicians in the world joining together to provide an expensive service to consumers\u2013is shockingly tone deaf, out of touch and even a smidge condescending. As Gibbard alludes to, it\u2019s definitely not doing much to convey solidarity with most working musicians today.\n\nAnd with its emphasis on high-quality sound, Tidal is counting on perceived value\u2013the illusion of exclusivity, that anyone who joins the service is part of an elite club or receiving a premium product. From a marketing standpoint, that\u2019s nothing new; it\u2019s the premise behind selling things such as branded headphones, Apple products and basketball player-branded sneakers at a higher cost, or the whole idea behind bottle service. But the artists involved with Tidal have perhaps overestimated the value of their image and brand in the tech space, which is an entirely different animal than the music industry itself. (Jay Z learned this the hard way already, in fact, thanks to the hiccups with his 2013 Samsung deal involving the release of \u201cMagna Carta Holy Grail.\u201d) Although tech gadgets such as Beats By Dre might benefit from celebrity endorsement, digital music loyalty is much more complex: Consumers prioritize ease of listening, song selection and choice, mobile accessibility and price more than they do a product backed by star power.\n\nOf course, the other problem is that recorded music already has a premium product to offer fans that\u2019s not Tidal: vinyl records, which continue to grow in popularity and show impressive sales growth. As Albini points out, vinyl is the medium audiophiles are likely going to gravitate toward anyway. \u201cIt\u2019s for the same reason that if you had a screen that displayed paintings in your living room, very few serious art enthusiasts would care for such a screen despite the fact that it might show you very high-resolution images of artworks,\u201d he told Vulture. \u201cThey want to own a piece of art that is a direct connection to the person who made it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "It's been 15 years since Metallica sued Napster \u2014\u00a0the free streaming \"revolution\" has happened.
