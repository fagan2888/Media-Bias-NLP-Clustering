Burwell was sent back to the lower courts to be settled.\n\nThe Obama administration had already decreed that religious nonprofits could opt out of providing the care by providing the government with a two-page form stating their objection. However, the nuns at Little Sisters of the Poor found that this, too, was complicit, and filed a lawsuit.\n\nFollowing oral argument, the Supreme Court asked both parties \u201cwhether contraceptive coverage could be provided to petitioners\u2019 employees, through petitioners\u2019 insurance companies, without any such notice from petitioners\u201d. Both the petitioners and the government replied that such an outcome was \u201cfeasible\u201d.\n\nFrom the unsigned opinion:\n\n\u201cPetitioners have clarified that their religious exercise is not infringed where they \u2018need to do nothing more than contract for a plan that does not include coverage for some or all forms of contraception,\u2019 even if their employees receive cost-free contraceptive coverage from the same insurance company\u2026 The Government has confirmed that the challenged procedures \u2018for employers with insured plans could be modified to operate in the manner posited in the Court\u2019s order while still ensuring that the affected women receive contraceptive coverage seamlessly, together with the rest of their health coverage.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Supreme Court did not take a position on the distinction of Zubik v. Burwell \u2014 that is, if the Affordable Care Act \u201csubstantially burdens\u201d the religious freedom of non-profits.\n\nFrom the opinion:\n\n\u201cThe Court expresses no view on the merits of the cases. In particular, the Court does not decide whether petitioners\u2019 religious exercise has been substantially burdened, whether the Government has a compelling interest, or whether the current regulations are the least restrictive means of serving that interest.\u201d\n\nThe petitioners and the Obama administration are now responsible for reaching a \u201ccompromise\u201d in the lower courts. That decision will have a far-reaching effect on healthcare coverage provided by religious nonprofits, such as religiously-affiliated universities and hospitals.\n\nReach Iain Oldman at ioldman@publicsource.org.\n\nhttp://publicsource.org/from-the-source/obamacare-birth-control-case-back-lower-courts#.VztpnuQm-fg", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "https://ionenewpittsburghcourier.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/ap_nuns640x4801.jpg?w=150", "sailthru.author": "Iain Oldman, PublicSource", "description": "The United States Supreme Court unanimously decided that it doesn\u2019t want to decide on the case concerning a nonprofit religious organization\u2019s objection to providing free contraceptive coverage through the Affordable Care Act.
