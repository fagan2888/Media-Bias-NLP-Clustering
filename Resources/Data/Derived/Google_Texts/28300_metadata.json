The second challenge argues that the president\u2019s decision to delay implementation of aspects of the ACA violates his Constitutional duty to \u201ctake care that the laws be faithfully executed.\" The argument here, elaborated in congressional testimony earlier this week, is that the Obama administration's announcement, in a July 2013 blog post, that he would continue \u201cto Implement the ACA in a Careful, Thoughtful Manner\u201d without mentioning the statutory deadline of January 1, 2014, violates his constitutional responsibilities. In addition, the president is alleged to have violated the \u201ctake care\u201d clause when he said the federal government would not require insurance companies to implement all the provisions of the ACA on schedule. The counter-argument, as outlined by Lazarus in his congressional testimony, is that the decision to delay enforcement of the employer mandate and other statutory provisions isn\u2019t a decision not to enforce a law that Obama considers his signature legislature achievement. It\u2019s a \u201cphasing in\u201d decision, similar to the ones that agency heads from other administrations have long defended. For example Michael O. Levitt, President George Bush\u2019s Health and Human Services Secretary, declared in July that \u201cThe [Obama] Administration\u2019s decision to delay the employer mandate was wise.\u201d And, as Lazarus argued, the Administrative Procedure Act, which allows courts to strike down agency action that is unreasonably delayed, isn\u2019t an inflexible command: Courts have long made clear that the statutory deadline is one factor to consider in evaluating whether a delay is unreasonable. Moreover, Lazarus argued, the mere fact that the Administrative Procedure Act allows courts to force dithering agencies to implement regulations only in rare cases suggests that Congress has long intended to give agencies broad discretion about when to implement the regulations in the first place. Regardless of where you come down in this debate, it will be difficult, as Jonathan Adler notes, to find someone who could satisfy the \u201cstanding\u201d requirements to get the case into court because it\u2019s hard to identify someone who has been tangibly injured by the decision to delay implantation of parts of the ACA. For all these reasons, Lazarus predicted the odds \u201cas close to zero as you can get\u201d that a court would buy the \u201ctake care\u201d argument.\n\nThe third Obamacare challenge claims that the employer mandate, which Chief Justice Roberts upheld last year as a tax, is invalid under the Origination Clause of the Constitution, which provides that all bills for raising revenue \u201cshall originate in the House.\u201d As Adler noted, the point of the Origination Clause was to check the taxing power by ensuring that taxes were levied by representatives who were closer to the people than senators. But federal courts in the past have upheld bills passed under the same procedural maneuver the Senate used for the employer mandate, known as \u201cstrike and replace,\u201d where the Senate takes the text of a House bill, erases it, and replaces it with the text of a Senate bill. The Pacific Legal Defense Fund, which is challenging the health care mandate, argues that no previous case \u201chas ever involved as extreme an example of the strike-and-replace procedure as the one used in passing\u201d the Affordable Care Act. But as Adler candidly acknowledged, courts are unlikely to want to distinguish among acceptable and unacceptable versions of the \u201cstrike-and-replace\u201d procedure; they\u2019re more likely to view this as the sort of political question that Congress should resolve on its own. \u201cIf courts were to address this,\" Adler said, \"they would have to deal with the question of how much amending is too much, and I think the current Court is unlikely to do so.\u201d\n\nOf course, anything is possible in constitutional litigation: The challenge to the employer mandate itself as exceeding Congress\u2019s power to regulate interstate commerce was initially dismissed by many commentators as implausible. Ultimately, however, five justices accepted it.\n\nJeffrey Rosen is the legal affairs editor of The New Republic.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Although the Supreme Court upheld the centerpiece of the Affordable Care Act more than a year ago, this was the week that the second round of legal challenges to Obamacare made their prime-time debut.
