Thad Cochran of Mississippi on Tuesday thwarted a tea party effort to oust the 40-year Washington veteran by bringing black Democratic voters into what his opponent thought was a private duel between two Republican factions.\n\nGeorgia operatives had a hand in Cochran\u2019s victory.\n\nLate campaign disclosure documents filed in the race show that Mississippi Conservatives, a political action committee run by the son of that state\u2019s former governor, Haley Barbour, paid tens of thousands of dollars to get-out-the-vote artist Mitzi Bickers, an African-American pastor and former president of the Atlanta school board.\n\nLook for the tactic of crossover voting to be quickly duplicated elsewhere in the GOP\u2019s civil war between conservative purity and pragmatism.\n\nLeo Smith, the minority engagement director for the Georgia Republican party, serves as a mentor to a half-dozen young African-American Republicans with political ambition. Within days of Cochran\u2019s victory, Smith said four of his wards received invitations from various (and unnamed) GOP campaigns to act as liaisons to African-American communities.\n\n\u201cWe are in a phase where things are being stirred up, and these are people who are ready to spread the word, and are getting an opportunity to do exactly that,\u201d Smith said.\n\nIn other words, the Cochran effect offers Republicans yet another opportunity to broaden their base \u2013 something GOP leaders say, time and again, is needed for their party\u2019s survival.\n\nHere and in Mississippi, the resort to crossover voting \u2013 asking your general-election enemy to pull your bacon out of the fire \u2013 has raised the hackles of some Republicans.\n\n\u201cThere is something a bit strange, there is something a bit unusual about a Republican primary that\u2019s decided by liberal Democrats,\u201d said Chris McDaniel, the state senator who lost to Cochran. \u201cSo much for principles.\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019s no place for that kind of outrage \u2013 at least, not in Georgia, where Republicans have a history of crashing Democratic parties. In fact, GOP voters will do so again, in a major way, on July 22.\n\nIt is all but certain that Republicans will pick the next Democratic sheriff of DeKalb County. Which means the winner isn\u2019t likely to be Vernon Jones, the former DeKalb CEO, but interim incumbent Jeff Mann.\n\nThis is an officially sanctioned case of crossover voting. Because Sheriff Tom Brown resigned mid-term, to make his unsuccessful Democratic primary challenge to U.S. Rep. Hank Johnson, state law required a quick, special election to replace him.\n\nSpecial elections are non-partisan, giving GOP voters a rare opportunity to insert themselves into an argument that would otherwise be settled within the confines of a Democratic primary.\n\nA first vote on May 20, held concurrent with party primaries, winnowed a field of eight down to Mann and Jones. Democratic ballots cast in DeKalb County that day out-numbered Republican ones by 3-to-1. That dynamic will change in next month\u2019s runoff.\n\nOn the Democratic side of primary voting, the top race will be the runoff for state school superintendent between state Rep. Alisha Morgan Thomas of Austell, and Valarie Wilson, a former member of the Decatur school board.\n\nIt\u2019s a low-budget contest, and few extra voters will be driven to the polls by advertising, whether direct mail, radio or TV.\n\nBut on the Republican side of the ballot, voters will be picking the winner of the GOP race for U.S. Senate, the highest-dollar contest in the state. Substantial Republican turnout is expected.\n\nThe implications of the non-partisan contest have been obvious from the beginning. The general consultant for the Mann campaign is Mark Rountree of Landmark Communications, who specializes in Republican campaigns.\n\nBoth Mann and Jones are African-American. Rountree is not, so you might think that this could matter in DeKalb\u2019s highly polarized climate.\n\nBut Rountree has worked for a Democrat in DeKalb before. In 2000, he was the strategist behind a young state representative who sought the top job in DeKalb County government, by portraying himself as a black conservative who could build bridges to white voters. His name was \u2013 and is \u2014 Vernon Jones.\n\nWe reached out to Jones this week, but he prefers not to speak to representatives of this newspaper.\n\nDeKalb officialdom has lined up behind Mann, as have all the mayors of cities on the north side of DeKalb \u2013 Brookhaven, Dunwoody, Doraville, Chamblee and Avondale Estates.\n\nMann has worked both northside and southside voters, aided by Brown, the former sheriff. Mann was Brown\u2019s chief deputy.\n\n\u201cHe was my No. 2. I\u2019d be lying if I said I didn\u2019t groom him for the job,\u201d Brown said. \u201cFor the last six years, I handled the political stuff. Jeff Mann ran the office.\u201d\n\nBrown says that Jones will still do well among blue-collar African-Americans in south DeKalb, but that his once-powerful allure is fading. Six years ago, in a Democratic runoff for U.S. Senate, Jones lost his home county to the eventual nominee, Atlanta attorney Jim Martin. Jones snared 40 percent of Democratic ballots then. Last month, his total was 22 percent.\n\n\u201cVernon\u2019s stock goes down as African-American personal income goes up,\u201d Brown said.\n\nBut it is the prospect of thousands of Republican voters piling on that is Jones\u2019 biggest hurdle. Even his friends agree.\n\nState Sen. Fran Millar, R-Dunwoody, has been an admirer of the former DeKalb CEO since their days together in the state Legislature. \u201cVernon Jones has great talent as a retail politician. But in this race, I think Crazy Horse has him surrounded, and I don\u2019t think that there\u2019s a way out for him,\u201d Millar said.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Political Insider blog", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://politics.blog.ajc.com/2014/06/28/crossover-voting-last-week-in-mississippi-next-month-in-dekalb-county/", "image": "http://cmgajcpolitics.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/inmate-1026.jpg?w=640", "type": "article", "description": "So U.S. Sen.
