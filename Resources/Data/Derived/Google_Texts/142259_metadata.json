And we\u2019re not talking about matters of interpretation. CBO has not changed its view that the ACA will reduce the deficit; health costs have not increased faster than before; premiums are not skyrocketing.\n\nChait treats this as a story about the way the right is handling Obamacare\u2019s success. Conservatives made a number of very specific predictions about what would happen when the ACA went into effect: health spending would soar, deficits would balloon, premiums would shoot up, more people would lose insurance than gain it. When none of these things happened, when the law\u2019s first year of full operation went better than even supporters had expected, the reaction was, I believe, something new in American politics: right-wingers simply acted as if their predictions had come true, as if all the imagined disasters were actual truths on the ground.\n\nThat is indeed part of the story about that Moore op-ed. But there\u2019s another aspect of the story, which is Moore himself: this is a guy who has a troubled relationship with facts. I don\u2019t mean that he\u2019s a slick dissembler; I mean that he seems more or less unable to publish an article without filling it with howlers \u2014 true, all erring in the direction he wants \u2014 in a way that ends up doing his cause a disservice. For example, his attempt to refute something I wrote about Kansas ended up being mainly a story about why Stephen can\u2019t count, which presumably wasn\u2019t his intention.\n\nBut here\u2019s the mystery: evidently Moore has had a successful career. Why?\n\nThink about Heritage: It\u2019s immensely wealthy, and could surely afford to hire a technically competent right-wing hack. The Wall Street Journal, similarly, could have attracted someone much less likely to trip over his own intellectual shoelaces. Again, the problem isn\u2019t even that Moore got the macroeconomics of recent years all wrong, although he did; it\u2019s the inability to write without making embarrassing mistakes.\n\nSo why is he there (and he\u2019s not alone \u2014 there are some other incompetent hacks at Heritage)?\n\nI suspect that the incompetence is actually desirable at some level \u2014 a smart hack might turn honest, or something, But it\u2019s remarkable.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20150218180049, "BN": "krugman", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/krugman", "DISPLAYDATE": "February 18, 2015", "keywords": "Uncategorized", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/krugman/The Mystery of Moore ( 20150218 )", "PT": "Blogs", "SCG": "krugman", "sourceApp": "blogs", "twitter": {"description": "Why not a better hack?", "title": "The Mystery of Moore", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/18/the-mystery-of-moore/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "site": "@NytimesKrugman", "card": "summary"}, "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/krugman/post", "description": "Why not a better hack?", "CG": "Opinion", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "February 18, 2015", "article": {"published_time": 1424300449, "author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/paulkrugman/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Uncategorized", "modified_time": "2015-02-18T23:00:49-05:00"}, "utime": 20150218230049, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20150218, "pdate": 20150218, "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Paul Krugman Blog", "description": "Why not a better hack?", "title": "The Mystery of Moore", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/18/the-mystery-of-moore/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/18/the-mystery-of-moore/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "The Mystery of Moore", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd5ebe\"", "article_summary": "That is indeed part of the story about that Moore op-ed.\nBut here\u2019s the mystery: evidently Moore has had a successful career.\nJonathan Chait seems boggled at an op-ed from Stephen Moore, the chief economist at the Heritage Foundation, attacking Obamacare: Not one alleged fact cited in the piece is right.\nBut there\u2019s another aspect of the story, which is Moore himself: this is a guy who has a troubled relationship with facts.\nAgain, the problem isn\u2019t even that Moore got the macroeconomics of recent years all wrong, although he did; it\u2019s the inability to write without making embarrassing mistakes."}
