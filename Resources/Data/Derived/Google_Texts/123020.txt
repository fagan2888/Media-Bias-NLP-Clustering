(CNSNews.com) – Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) said that despite the claims in his State of the Union address on Tuesday, President Barack Obama’s legacy will be one of failures and broken promises.



“His legacy is going to be arrogance. It’s going to be failures, and his legacy is going to be that he had the 2013 PolitiFact lie of the year – if you like your health care, you can keep it, and I think probably the 2016 PolitiFact lie of the year will be if you like your guns, you can keep them,” Blackburn told CNSNews.com, referring to the website that charts the truthfulness of political statements.

Ahead of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, being passed by Democrats and signed into law by the president in 2010, Obama promised the American people that if they liked their doctor or their health care plan they could keep it.



PolitiFact named it the Lie of the Year in 2013.

“So this fall, as cancellation letters were going out to approximately 4 million Americans, the public realized Obama’s breezy assurances were wrong,” the PolitiFact website report stated.



On Jan. 4, the White House announced a “series of executive actions” to reduce “gun violence,” including expanded licensing for gun sellers and background checks for gun buyers.
