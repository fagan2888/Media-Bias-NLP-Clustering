The ad, which promotes incumbent Republican Sen. Ron Johnson for his opposition to the Iran nuclear agreement, pans across an image of a smiling Obama and Rouhani as the narrator accuses Obama of signing a \u201ctoothless agreement that makes us less safe.\u201d The problem: Obama has never met Rouhani.\n\nBuzzFeed News called out Restoration PAC in a July 23 post under the headline, \u201cAnti-Iran Deal TV Ad Uses Fake Image Of Obama Meeting Iranian President.\u201d The article said the original, authentic image was of Obama meeting with former Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in 2011. In the image used in the ad, BuzzFeed said, Rouhani was Photoshopped in.\n\nHere\u2019s the image used in the Restoration PAC ad:\n\nAnd here\u2019s the original photo it came from, according to BuzzFeed:\n\nWhen we reached out to Restoration PAC by email, spokesman Dan Curry asked whether BuzzFeed \u201chad any proof the photo was fake.\u201d\n\nWe sent Curry links to several articles noting that a potentially historic handshake photo-op between the two leaders at the United Nations in 2013 never materialized. And the White House later confirmed to us that Obama and Rouhani have never met.\n\nCurry responded with an official \u201cStatement to FactCheck regarding liberal Buzzfeed post.\u201d Here\u2019s the part that addresses the photo:\n\nCurry, July 23: BuzzFeed was not able to provide any proof that the photo was fake and it indeed is in circulation widely on the internet. There also are no articles claiming the image is fake. However, out of an abundance of caution, we are replacing the image with side-by-side Obama and Rouhani photos that make exactly the same point. The composition of the original image was not central to the ad\u2019s point. The revised ad will be in circulation Friday morning.\n\nKatherine Miller, the political editor for BuzzFeed News, told us via email that her only comment was, \u201cThe image is fake.\u201d\n\nAs promised, Restoration PAC updated the ad with a new image, of Obama and Rouhani side-by-side but clearly not together.\n\nThe defense for the manipulated image \u2014 that \u201cit indeed is in circulation widely on the internet\u201d \u2014 is, in fact, no defense at all. We\u2019ve got a whole section of our website devoted to bogus information circulating widely on the Internet.\n\nWe\u2019ll leave it up to readers to determine whether or not the image is \u201ccentral to the ad\u2019s point.\u201d But we note that images, in general, can be powerful and persuasive in political ads. And if Obama had shaken hands with Rouhani, it would have been news.\n\nAs Time\u2019s Michael Crowley wrote in the days leading up to Rouhani\u2019s visit to the United Nations in 2013: \u201cAn encounter between Obama and Iran\u2019s new president at the United Nations on Tuesday would be the most important\u2014or at least the most analyzed\u2014handshake since the historic grip between Rabin and Arafat (or, if you prefer, Nixon and Elvis). It would only be a symbolic act, to be sure. But when it comes to international diplomacy, symbolism can go a long way.\u201d\n\nThe ad \u2014 which praises Sen. Johnson for \u201cunderstand[ing] that preventing Iran from getting the bomb is essential to our safety\u201d \u2014 is running in Madison, Milwaukee and Green Bay. A press release for the ad notes that it was produced by Rick Reed, a Republican strategist involved in the controversial Swift Boat Veterans for Truth ad campaign in 2004 that attacked Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry\u2019s military service. Restoration PAC is a conservative group that seeks to elect conservative Republicans to the Senate. According to its website, the PAC advocates for and against candidates based on their adherence to the \u201cBlueprint for the Restoration of America,\u201d an agenda that includes conservative principles such as reducing the size of government and the debt, cutting taxes, and repealing the Affordable Care Act.\n\nJohnson is set to square off for a second time against former Democratic Sen. Russ Feingold in what Roll Call called \u201cone of the country\u2019s most closely watched races.\u201d\n\nUpdate, July 31: The Iranian flag pictured in the fake Obama-Rouhani handshake photo is incorrect, as you can see here (h/t our international fact-checking colleagues at Rouhani Meter).\n\n\u2014 Robert Farley", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9fda\"", "article_summary": "Restoration PAC is a conservative group that seeks to elect conservative Republicans to the Senate.\nIn the image used in the ad, BuzzFeed said, Rouhani was Photoshopped in.\nAnd the White House later confirmed to us that Obama and Rouhani have never met.\nHowever, out of an abundance of caution, we are replacing the image with side-by-side Obama and Rouhani photos that make exactly the same point.\nThere also are no articles claiming the image is fake."}
