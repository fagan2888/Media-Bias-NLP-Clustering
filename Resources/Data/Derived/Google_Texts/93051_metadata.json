Now, tax forms for thousands of customers are still missing.\n\nJeff Ward checks his physical mailbox and his virtual mailbox every day, to no avail.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve had plenty of time, they knew this was coming,\u201d Ward told KPIX 5 ConsumerWatch.\n\nBut Covered California still hasn\u2019t issued the tax form it was required to send enrollees like Ward over a month ago. The agency said he could file an amended return.\n\nAnd he\u2019s not alone. Recent widow Stacy Soggins still hasn\u2019t received her 1095-A. KPIX 5 first featured her story last month, when covered California assured that her case was an isolated incident.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re seeing an abundance of people who have not received their 1095,\u201d Covered California spokesperson Dana Howard said in February.\n\nCovered California now acknowledges least 4,500 enrollees, had not received their tax forms. That\u2019s in addition to the more than 100,000 who received inaccurate forms.\n\nAnd those numbers still don\u2019t include people like Jeff, who found was just told he had to to file a dispute to get a form and wait up to 60 days, well past April 15th.\n\nKPIX 5\u2019s Julie Watts: \u201cWasn\u2019t it Covered California\u2019s responsibility to get these forms out over a month ago?\u201d\n\nDana Howard: \u201cSure, it is our responsibility to get the forms out on time, and accurately. This is the first time that tax forms and taxes have been intertwined with healthcare.\u201d\n\nHoward said they sent the vast majority of forms out on time, and they are working through the procedural issues causing the other delays.\n\nIt\u2019s no consolation for people like Ward, who worry Covered California\u2019s delays will cost him. \u201cI owe money. I don\u2019t want to have to pay interest or penalty on top of that. I want to file on time,\u201d he said.\n\nHoward: \u201cThe best thing for them to do is to talk with a tax advisor.\u201d\n\nWatts: \u201cIs Covered California gonna pay for that?\u201d\n\nHoward: \u201cWell, this is a new day for consumers.\u201d\n\nWatts: \u201cDana, I\u2019m sorry, let me interrupt you there. Can you answer that question? Is Covered California going to pay for fees, for interest, for costs incurred?\n\nHoward: \u201cWell Julie, this is a new day for consumers.\u201d\n\nWe asked the question several times and got the same response.\n\nAnd, it\u2019s true, it is a new day. But consumers like Ward still can\u2019t file their taxes.\n\nCovered California said at least 4,500 of the missing tax forms went out last week, but those do not include the viewers who have contacted KPIX 5 over the past month.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Last month, KPIX 5 reported on the problems Covered California has had issuing tax forms to people who bought insurance on the state-run exchange.
