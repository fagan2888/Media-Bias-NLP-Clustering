The California Democrat introduced her bill, the Denying Firearms and Explosives to Dangerous Terrorists Act, in February, around the same time that Republican Representative Peter King proposed a similar bill in the House. But the so-called \u201cterror gap\u201d didn\u2019t develop political momentum until ISIS-affiliated terrorists shot and killed more than 100 people in Paris last month. In the wake of the San Bernardino attacks, Democrats have redoubled their efforts to close the loophole, in the process inverted the usual roles in in gun reform debates, putting Republicans on the defensive by linking the issue to national security.\n\nIn response, Senate Republicans offered their own solution when Democrats attempted to attach Feinstein\u2019s plan to a Obamacare repeal bill the day after the San Bernardino shooting. Both sides\u2019 terror gap fixes fell short during that skirmish \u2014 but the issue is all but certain to stay on the agenda well into 2016, especially as presidential candidates are forced to stake out positions on the dueling proposals. Meanwhile, some governors are taking matters into their own hands, presenting a third venue for debate.\n\nIt\u2019s all a lot to keep straight. Below, a guide to whose proposal does what \u2014 and the larger aims of each.\n\nThe Feinstein plan\n\nFeinstein\u2019s bill calls on the Justice Department to check would be gun buyers against the government\u2019s consolidated terror watch list \u2014 which is much larger than the \u201cno fly\u201d list, including a reported 800,000 names, of whom an estimated 40,000 are Americans. (The \u201cno fly\u201d list is a much smaller subset, containing approximately 6,400 Americans out of 64,000 names in all.) The bill does not require the Justice Department to block the sale when a background check returns a match, though it does give the Attorney General that authority. Republicans oppose the measure on the grounds it would strip those on the watch list of their constitutional right to a gun without due process.\n\nDemocrats have been open about the political aims of forcing votes on smaller-bore gun measures like the terror gap as part of a strategy to turn the larger issue to their advantage. \u201cThere are a good number of our Republican colleagues dreading these two votes,\u201d New York Senator Chuck Schumer told reporter last week. \u201cDreading them.\u201d New Hampshire\u2019s Kelly Ayotte, up for re-election next November, is one of those: two days after voting no on Feinstein\u2019s amendment, she sought to preempt future political attacks, tweeting that said she favored banning those on the no-fly list from purchasing guns, provided there was \u201cdue process for Americans who are wrongfully on the list.\u201d\n\nThe Republican alternative\n\nIntroduced by Texan John Cornyn, the Senate Majority Whip and a frequent author of pro-gun legislation, the Republican plan allows the government to block a firearms sale only when it can provide sufficient proof that the prospective buyer \u201chas committed, or will commit, an act of terrorism.\u201d When a gun shopper on the terror watch list triggers that process, the Justice Department would have no more than 72 hours to assemble its case and secure what\u2019s called an \u201cemergency judicial motion\u201d by presenting a judge with probable cause. If the Justice Department fails to do that, the purchase would go through.\n\nThe Cornyn proposal employs a higher burden of proof than the terror watch list itself, which is a tool for ongoing intelligence gathering and investigations. Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid calling the plan \u201cdangerous\u201d and \u201cridiculous.\u201d Neither Feinstein or Cornyn\u2019s offices returned requests for comment.\n\nThe state option\n\nJust as states have enacted a flurry of new gun laws in recent years, so have they presented a separate forum for addressing \u201cthe terror gap.\u201d In 2013, New Jersey Governor (and now Republican presidential hopeful) Chris Christie signed a law that bans those on the terrorist watch list from buying guns in the Garden State. When the issue rose to new prominence this fall, he initially stopped short of imposing his approach on his fellow governors, telling CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper that he believed that the matter is best left up to individual states. Following the San Bernardino attack, though, he modified his position, saying that he \u201cdoesn\u2019t mind\u201d federal action on the subject.\n\nIn recent days, Democratic governors in two traditionally left-leaning states have expressed interest in implementing similar bans. Connecticut\u2019s Dannel Malloy said he would sign an executive order banning individuals on the watch list (as well as suspected gang members) from purchasing guns in his state. New York\u2019s Andrew Cuomo said over the weekend that he\u2019d like to follow suit.\n\nTo implement such policies, both states would need to a way to access the classified terror watch list database. Malloy has said his office is in negotiations with the White House to make that happen. New Jersey police officials told the Connecticut Mirror that while they don\u2019t have a copy of the terrorist watch list, they are able to check names against the list during the state\u2019s usual gun background check procedure. \u201cWe do have access to that data,\u201d a police captain said.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#082336", "description": "A new source of reporting and insight about guns in America.", "og": {"site_name": "The Trace", "description": "\u201cIf you\u2019re too dangerous to board a plane, you\u2019re too dangerous to buy a gun.\u201d That\u2019s the bumper-sticker-simple premise Senator Diane Feinstein used to sum up legislation she has co-sponsored to block those on the consolidated terror watch list from buying guns.
