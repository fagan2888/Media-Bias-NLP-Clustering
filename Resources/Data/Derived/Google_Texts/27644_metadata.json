He ran a sound check of the first words of his text (\u201cMy fellow Americans\u201d) and made a joke about White House photographer Fred J. Maroon\u2014\u201dI\u2019m afraid he\u2019ll catch me pickin\u2019 my nose.\u201d After delivering the 3 min. 40 sec. address on national TV, he rose from his desk and, as he walked out, told the crew, \u201cHave a merry Christmas, fellas.\u201d\n\nIn August.\n\nForty years ago today, Richard Nixon became the first U.S. President to resign from office. He had been re-elected to serve four more years in 1972, with the slogan \u201cNow more than ever.\u201d In his victory over George McGovern, he received more votes than any other President in history. But faced with impeachment by the House of Representatives over the Watergate scandal, Nixon announced his resignation in that Thursday-night speech. At noon the following day, Aug. 9, 1974, he raised his hands flashing inappropriate and pathetic double-victory signs and helicoptered off the White House lawn to Andrews Air Force Base, from which he made his final trip on Air Force One to his San Clemente redoubt.\n\nGerald Ford, who then became President, spoke to the nation: \u201cMy fellow Americans, our long national nightmare is over.\u201d\n\n(WATCH: Harry Shearer\u2019s re-enactment of Richard Nixon preparing for his resignation speech)\n\nMany Americans then and since thought of Nixon\u2019s 5 1/2-year reign as a long national nightmare. When the disgraced Chief Executive died in 1994, historian Jonathan Rauch wrote in the New Republic that Nixon\u2019s had been \u201cthe worst presidency of the century.\u201d Inheriting the Vietnam morass from Lyndon Johnson, Nixon promised to \u201cend the war and win the peace,\u201d yet he extended U.S. and allied military action into Cambodia, resulting in a half-million Southeast Asian deaths and 15,000 extra names on the Vietnam Memorial. Paranoid and prejudiced, he ordered his minions to spy illegally on his perceived enemies, who were many. He did not know in advance of the June 1972 break-in of the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate Hotel, but he approved its cover-up and lied about the conspiracy. Tapes of these conversations, which he had made for posterity, led to his downfall. Nixon resigned because he bugged himself.\n\nNixon\u2019s shifty eyes and perpetual 5 o\u2019clock shadow made him a natural fit for caricatured villainy. According to the Internet Movie Database, he has been impersonated in more than 80 films and television shows, from Dan Aykroyd\u2019s Nixon (with John Belushi\u2019s Henry Kissinger) on Saturday Night Live to the double-barreled blast in 2008: Frank Langella in Frost/Nixon and Josh Brolin in Oliver Stone\u2019s biopic. For many Nixon haters, he is the character Rip Torn excoriated in Blind Ambition, or the mad wailer incarnated by Philip Baker Hall in Robert Altman\u2019s Secret Honor. In the decade after his resignation, when those portrayals took hold, until today, the very mention of Nixon can cause splenetic outbursts from liberals who lived through his long career.\n\n(READ: Richard Corliss on Richard Nixon and Frost/Nixon)\n\nEven those who might sympathize with Nixon have to acknowledge that the man was no natural performer. In fact, he was one of a surprisingly high number of presidential aspirants who rose in the first era of TV but seemed incapable of selling their No. 1 product: themselves. Dwight Eisenhower, Ronald Reagan, Jack Kennedy, Bill Clinton, Barack Obama and, in his faux-cowboy fashion, George W. Bush could make the sale; Adlai Stevenson, Hubert Humphrey, George H.W. Bush, Bob Dole, Al Gore, John Kerry, John McCain and Mitt Romney could not, because they rarely gave the impression they were comfortable in their own skin. Nixon, with his mellifluous baritone, was a great politician for radio but creepy on TV.\n\nHe gave his opponents plenty of reasons to put him on their own enemy lists, beginning with his first run for Congress in 1946, when he daubed his rival, Helen Gahagan Douglas, with red smears. He teamed with Senator Joe McCarthy in exposing, or inventing, communist spies in the U.S. government. A charge of financial improprieties nearly lost Nixon his spot as Eisenhower\u2019s running mate in the 1952 presidential election, until he took to the airwaves with his Checkers speech, declaring that he would not return the gift of a little dog that his daughters loved. Narrowly defeated by Kennedy in the 1960 presidential race, Nixon then ran for California governor, losing to the incumbent, Pat Brown, and later declaring to the press, \u201cYou won\u2019t have Nixon to kick around anymore.\u201d\n\nThat was Tricky Dick: mean winner, sore loser.\n\nPeople kept kicking him around for decades. He eventually found surprising allies among what was left of the American left. Noam Chomsky, of whom few are leftier, called Nixon \u201cthe last liberal American President.\u201d Sometimes goaded by large Democratic majorities in both houses of Congress, but often initiating the proposals, Nixon signed bills to create the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration for workers\u2019 injury claims and Title IX (sponsored by Democratic Senator Birch Bayh), which subsidized women\u2019s sports programs. He fought for affirmative-action hiring policies and approved legislation that enabled injured workers under 65 to receive Medicare.\n\n(READ: Why Noam Chomsky thinks Richard Nixon was the last liberal American President)\n\nNixon nominated four Justices to the Supreme Court, all of whom Congress approved, and three of whom voted with the 7-2 majority in the Roe v. Wade decision allowing abortions. Nixon appointee Harry Blackmun wrote the majority opinion, about which the President made no public declaration. (If he had appointed four pro-lifers to the court, the judgment would not have passed.) Nixon also instituted cost-of-living adjustments to Social Security and pushed for a comprehensive health care program, to be financed through then new HMOs. His negotiations with Senator Ted Kennedy foundered when Kennedy pushed for a single-payer plan. The Nixon version, with a few wrinkles, passed in 2010 as the Affordable Care Act.\n\nLast Monday, Stephen Colbert devoted an entire episode of his show to assessing the legacy of a man he described as \u201cmy all-time favorite non-Reagan President, non-Cheney Vice President and non-Oats Quaker.\u201d Colbert noted that Nixon \u201cfounded the EPA, ended school segregation, lowered the voting age to 18 and endorsed the Equal Rights Amendment. But his greatest achievement was restoring diplomatic relations with China, for which we owe Nixon a lasting debt, and China $1.3 trillion.\u201d This is mostly true. Nixon did sign the 26th Amendment, which allowed 18-year-olds to vote, \u201cdespite my misgivings about the constitutionality of this one provision.\u201d He met communist leader Mao Zedong to launch a d\u00e9tente as trade partners. He signed an Executive Order to establish the Environmental Protection Agency, endorsed Congress\u2019s passage of the ERA for women and, over the objections of Vice President Spiro Agnew, enforced school desegregation.\n\n(SEE: The Colbert Report episode on Richard Nixon)\n\nRe-revisionists like Erik Loomis argue that \u201cRichard Nixon was a liberal in no way \u2026 Nixon didn\u2019t like signing those bills. He would have LOVED to rule in the 1980s when he could slash the welfare state, kill Central American commies, ignore the AIDS crisis, and undermine environmental regulations. But he couldn\u2019t do that between 1969 and 1974 \u2026 As it was, he wanted to build support for the war by signing relatively liberal legislation.\u201d Whatever Nixon, or today\u2019s conservatives, might have loved to do, he did what he did. And instead of vilifying liberals, whom he may have deeply opposed and irrationally feared, he would quote Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s definition\u2014\u201dIt is a wonderful definition, and I agree with him\u201d\u2014that \u201ca liberal is a man who wants to build bridges over the chasms that separate humanity from a better life.\u201d\n\nBy any definition, Nixon and the Congress achieved a spectacular liberal domestic agenda between 1969 and 1974. \u201cThe War President\u201d was really Lyndon Johnson: the Next Generation, lowering defense spending and pushing Johnson\u2019s commitment to the Great Society. During Nixon\u2019s presidency, the government slashed its defense budget\u2019s share of the GDP by more than 50% and raised social-welfare programs by two-thirds; as Rauch notes, \u201cthis was a staggering change to have made in only six years.\u201d Food-stamp benefits, welfare assistance, the minimum wage: they all went up under Nixon.\n\n(READ: Jonathan Rauch on \u201cthe worst presidency of the century\u201d)\n\nIn part, they went up because, for half a century, from Roosevelt to Jimmy Carter, the flow of federal entitlements was essentially progressive. Poor and working-class citizens got more assistance, and by 1975 the richest Americans\u2014the top half of the wealthiest 1%\u2014reached the lowest proportion of the GDP in the past 100 years. That drift shifted in the 1980s under Reagan, who put skids on New Deal, Fair Deal and Great Society legislation. Since then, the countercurrent has swelled to tidal-wave proportions. In 2008, as Obama and McCain vied for the presidency, political commentator Samuel Smith itemized Nixon\u2019s agenda in an AlterNet story under this headline: \u201cIf Nixon Were Alive Today, He Would Be Far Too Liberal to Get Even the Democratic Nomination.\u201d\n\nObamacare notwithstanding, the current President\u2019s progressive instincts have been neutered by the rise of the Tea Party and Luddite conservatism. Speaker of the House John Boehner, when asked about his Congress\u2019s reluctance to pass new laws, has said his mandate is to repeal the bad old ones\u2014by which he means social programs. (We must not stand still; we must march boldly backward.) The top half of the 1%, and the corporations they run, have regained all their power and loot, plus some. The Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act. State assemblies manipulate laws to close legal abortion clinics. Citizens along the southern border tremble with rage at the influx of immigrants who would bolster our workforce in jobs that few Americans are willing to take. We are close to becoming the \u201cpitiful, helpless giant\u201d that Nixon described and denounced during the Vietnam War.\n\nForty years later, we can see Nixon as personally vindictive and socially generous, a small-minded man with a big-picture worldview. He wielded presidential power in ways both vicious and benevolent. Going against his conservative instincts, but perhaps listening to the Quaker voice from his youth, he endorsed progressive legislation that later Republicans have worked hard, largely successfully, to overturn. Liberals may hate themselves for thinking it, but they\u2019d be tempted to honor Richard Nixon\u2014now more than ever.\n\nCorrection: The original article misidentified the party of Indiana Senator Birch Bayh. He was a Democratic Senator. The article also misspelled the name of Helen Gahagan Douglas.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "On the 40th anniversary of his resignation, we consider Nixon's legacy as a world statesman and dirty-trickster - and liberal president.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "On the 40th anniversary of his resignation, we consider Nixon's legacy as a world statesman, a dirty trickster and\u2014gasp!\u2014our last liberal President", "title": "Cranky Guy: Nixon's Still the One", "url": "http://time.com/3095963/nixon-still-one/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/138420558.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1001", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/138420558.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1001"}, "title": "Cranky Guy: Nixon's Still the One", "description": "On the 40th anniversary of his resignation, we consider Nixon's legacy as a world statesman, a dirty trickster and\u2014gasp!\u2014our last liberal President", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "TIME"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "richard nixon, watergate, checkers speach, impeachment, liberals, republicans, democrats", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "news_keywords": "Richard Nixon, Watergate, checkers speach, impeachment, liberals, republicans, democrats"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd91b6\"", "article_summary": "Nixon\u2019s shifty eyes and perpetual 5 o\u2019clock shadow made him a natural fit for caricatured villainy.\n(READ: Richard Corliss on Richard Nixon and Frost/Nixon)Even those who might sympathize with Nixon have to acknowledge that the man was no natural performer.\nGerald Ford, who then became President, spoke to the nation: \u201cMy fellow Americans, our long national nightmare is over.\u201d(WATCH: Harry Shearer\u2019s re-enactment of Richard Nixon preparing for his resignation speech)Many Americans then and since thought of Nixon\u2019s 5 1/2-year reign as a long national nightmare.\nForty years ago today, Richard Nixon became the first U.S. President to resign from office.\nHe was a Democratic Senator."}
