He compiled 222 receptions for 3,070 yards and 33 touchdowns during his time in the Mile High City, while averaging 86 catches and 12 touchdowns in his last two seasons, when Peyton Manning was his quarterback.\n\nThis past summer, he signed a five-year deal with the Jets, who ranked 31st in passing offense and 30th in total receiving yards in 2013, and whose quarterback is the young and inconsistent Geno Smith.\n\nDecker recently spoke to New York Post columnist Steve Serby about his time in Denver, the transition from a working with a future Hall-of-Fame quarterback to one who\u2019s still learning the ropes, his wife\u2019s swag (Serby\u2019s description, not mine), and even a prank by Manning that Decker will never forget. Here\u2019s a snippet:\n\nQ: How good of a practical joker is Peyton?\n\nA: Very good.\n\nQ: What\u2019s the best one you\u2019ve seen him pull off?\n\nA: The best personal one I\u2019ve seen him pull off was on me in Duke. We went out there just for a workout for a weekend, and at the end of the workout, we all went out to dinner. It was Eli and the Giants, us from the Broncos, the coaching staff from Duke. We\u2019re having a good time, all of a sudden these letters are handed out, and assume they\u2019re \u201cThanks for coming, it was a pleasure having you on campus,\u201d whatever. And it was an invoice of getting your laundry done, getting picked up from the airports, the coaching fees that they charged to you. On everyone else\u2019s bill it said, \u201cDecker\u2019s getting pranked, play along.\u201d And on mine it was like $3,500. I still have it. It was my wife\u2019s birthday that week and I was gonna take her to Napa. First year with Peyton, I figured I needed to kinda do what he asked. Once I saw that bill, I was like, \u201cYou gotta be kidding me,\u201d and he played it for a good five minutes, and they finally told me it was a joke. And at that time \u2014 I still am \u2014 pretty frugal, so I was like, \u201cOhh, you gotta be kidding,\u201d like I wouldn\u2019t even ask the coach to help coach me if it was gonna be this much.\u201d\n\nNice little practical joke Peyton drew up\u2026making me think I have to pay for workouts in Duke t/week @mortreport pic.twitter.com/UbR2Vsq49J \u2014 Eric Decker (@EricDecker87) April 11, 2013\n\nQ: How would you describe Peyton?\n\nA: He\u2019s The General, that\u2019s kinda I think the nickname he gets, but he really is the general as far as once you walk into the building, everything that he does, everything that we do, is for a reason, it has a purpose behind it. I\u2019ve never seen a guy that\u2019s do focused for such a long period of time \u2014 this is a game that you can get mentally fatigued, you can get physically fatigued, it gets hard at times. The little things every single day, he\u2019s on you about it, he\u2019s on himself about it. It\u2019s impressive. What he remembers, too \u2014 you can talk about a play from 1998, and he\u2019ll tell you what exactly happened. It\u2019s amazing.\n\nQ: People always talk about going from Peyton Manning to a second-year Jets quarterback Geno Smith.\n\nA: People are gonna say that because Peyton Manning right now \u2026 is gonna go down as one of the best quarterbacks to play this game, you know? You can\u2019t really compare one to the other. Geno has an incredible skill set. He\u2019s young, he\u2019s learning, but being around him for these five, six months, I\u2019ve been so impressed with the way he carries himself as well as the knowledge of the system, of how he throws the football, and the decision-making that he does make. It really is impressive for a guy his age. And I think if he progressing like he is, if he keeps working hard at it, I really do think he\u2019s gonna have a great career as well.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Broncos,Eric Decker,Geno Smith,Jacob Tamme,Jets,Peyton Manning", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "First-and-Orange", "description": "Former Broncos wide receiver Eric Decker recounted to The New York Post the most memorable prank Peyton Manning pulled on him while they were teammates.", "title": "The best prank Peyton Manning pulled on Eric Decker", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2014/09/13/best-prank-peyton-manning-pulled-eric-decker/29526/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2014/09/177616307-495x339.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Former Broncos wide receiver Eric Decker recounted to The New York Post the most memorable prank Peyton Manning pulled on him while they were teammates.", "title": "The best prank Peyton Manning pulled on Eric Decker", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2014/09/13/best-prank-peyton-manning-pulled-eric-decker/29526/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2014/09/177616307-495x339.jpg", "creator": "@nickijhabvala", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Former Broncos wide receiver Eric Decker recounted to The New York Post the most memorable prank Peyton Manning pulled on him while they were teammates."}, "article_summary": "A: The best personal one I\u2019ve seen him pull off was on me in Duke.\nQ: People always talk about going from Peyton Manning to a second-year Jets quarterback Geno Smith.\nA: People are gonna say that because Peyton Manning right now \u2026 is gonna go down as one of the best quarterbacks to play this game, you know?\nAnd I think if he progressing like he is, if he keeps working hard at it, I really do think he\u2019s gonna have a great career as well.\nHe compiled 222 receptions for 3,070 yards and 33 touchdowns during his time in the Mile High City, while averaging 86 catches and 12 touchdowns in his last two seasons, when Peyton Manning was his quarterback."}
