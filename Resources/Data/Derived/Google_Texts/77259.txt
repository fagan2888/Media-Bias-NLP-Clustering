Video of Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s awkward interaction with Sen. Chris Coons‘ daughter went viral last week, but the Delaware Democrat denies that his child believes the vice president is “creepy.”

“He was being Joe,” Mr. Coons said on “Fox News Sunday.”

Mr. Coons was sworn in for a new term last week, and video shows Mr. Biden leaning in and whispering to the senator’s daughter, Margaret, during the ceremony. The 13-year-old appears clearly uncomfortable and at one point turns her head away when Mr. Biden leans in to kiss her on the cheek.

Mr. Coons tried to downplay the entire incident.

“She doesn’t think the vice president is creepy,” he said. “He’s known my kids their whole lives. Joe was just being thoughtful. He was leaning forward — I could hear him — he was leaning forward whispering some encouragement. … He was encouraging her about how to get through a day with lots of cameras and lots of folks watching.”
