At the end of the year, they are supposed to square their anticipated earnings with what they actually made. Because most exchange members received higher incomes \u2014 through promotions or better jobs \u2014 they have to repay the IRS.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act sets a cap on the top repayment amount, so consumers don\u2019t get sticker shock at tax time. But Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, the Iowa Republican who has emerged as a key watchdog on Obamacare, said some exchange customers could intentionally misestimate their earnings, breach the cap and then avoid having to pay it all back.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unclear how many people might be intentionally underestimating their income to get an overpayment, and whether the statutory repayment cap should be changed to minimize this incentive,\u201d Mr. Grassley said. \u201cThe challenge is to balance cracking down on the intentional gaming of the credit with fairly treating taxpayers who have been overpaid through no fault of their own.\u201d\n\nThe large sums involved \u2014 several billion dollars over the next decade \u2014 could be particularly enticing for lawmakers scrambling to find every last cent to pump into other priorities, such as roads and bridges.\n\nTop Republicans hoping to repeal Obamacare say the overpayment issue is another symptom of a confusing law that puts the burden on low- and middle-income Americans and is proving susceptible to fraud.\n\nThe Health and Human Services Department\u2019s inspector general piled on Monday with a report that found the federal HealthCare.gov website for applying for coverage on the exchanges didn\u2019t accurately vet each enrollee for items such as citizenship, household income and family size during the law\u2019s first sign-up period, meaning some people may not have qualified for benefits they received last year.\n\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said it has rectified many of the issues highlighted in the report and is \u201ccontinuously improving and refining\u201d the process.\n\nThe inspector general also found that the administration was too generous in deciding that consumers made a \u201cgood-faith effort\u201d to extend the 90-day period for resolving inconsistencies between their applications and government data sources.\n\nRaising the caps\n\nObamacare defenders warn against being too harsh on customers because it doesn\u2019t make sense to demand full repayment of excessive subsidies in some cases. They say the caps should be eased rather than toughened.\n\n\u201cYou may end up with situations where your income is erratic, through no fault of your own,\u201d said Cheryl Fish-Parcham, the private insurance director at Families USA, which advocates for an affordable U.S. health care system.\n\nAs it stands, subsidized customers who underestimate their income must pay back no more than $1,250 \u2014 $2,500 for families \u2014 although repayments among low-income and midrange earners are capped at $300 and $750 ($600 and $1,500 for families), respectively.\n\nThe law was originally far more generous, recapping the amount the government could reclaim at $250 for individuals and $400 for families.\n\nBut Congress has twice passed bills raising the caps, freeing up more money to spend on other bipartisan initiatives \u2014 first in 2010 as part of the annual \u201cdoc fix\u201d to stave off cuts to Medicare reimbursements for doctors, and in 2011 to pay for repeal of Obamacare\u2019s unpopular \u201c1099\u201d provision, which would have required businesses to fill out tax forms every time they paid vendors $600 or more.\n\nPresident Obama signed those changes into law even as Democrats complained that lifting the caps amounted to a tax increase on low- and middle-income Americans.\n\nStill, about 400,000 people estimated their incomes so badly last year that they ended up keeping money they didn\u2019t deserve \u2014 to the tune of $345 million, IRS Commissioner John Koskinen told Congress last month.\n\nThe money usually goes straight to insurers, though the customers are responsible for paying back overpayments. Once they hit the repayment cap, however, the extra money amounts to a taxpayer-funded benefit that they didn\u2019t deserve.\n\nThe IRS couldn\u2019t say what the average overpayment was for the 400,000 or so customers who didn\u2019t have to make full repayments.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether Obamacare customers have the guile and sophistication to work the arcane system to their advantage, although gaming of the tax system is common, and government investigators raised red flags when they were able to enroll 11 fake enrollees into Obamacare and keep their coverage for a second year.\n\nCongress doesn\u2019t appear to have the appetite to go after the money. Aides in the House and Senate said there aren\u2019t immediate plans to erase or raise the caps.\n\nRepublicans say the only solution is to repeal Obamacare outright with a Republican president in 2017, clearing the decks for their own, yet-to-be-determined plan.\n\n\u201cObamacare\u2019s subsidy structure is so complicated that it\u2019s nearly impossible for Americans to get the math right,\u201d said Sen. John Barrasso, Wyoming Republican. \u201cThese people shouldn\u2019t be punished because of an incompetent government. The solution is to replace Obamacare with a simpler and fairer system.\u201d\n\nTimothy Jost, a law professor at Washington and Lee University who closely tracks the health care law, said exchange customers should get better at estimating their income over time, and 2014 might have been an aberrant year as customers had a difficult time logging onto balky Web systems to update their income status.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to get a closer fix on what people actually owe,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A quirk in the law means the IRS will never be able to recoup nearly $350 million in overpayments on Obamacare tax credits last year, and one top senator says he is worried that fraudsters will exploit the loophole to wring more cash out of the government.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A quirk in the law means the IRS will never be able to recoup nearly $350 million in overpayments on Obamacare tax credits last year, and one top senator says he is worried that fraudsters will exploit the loophole to wring more cash out of the government.", "title": "IRS may never recoup Obamacare tax credit overpayments totaling nearly $350 million", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/11/irs-may-never-recoup-obamacare-tax-credit-overpaym/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/11/Grassley.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/11/Grassley.jpg", "description": "A quirk in the law means the IRS will never be able to recoup nearly $350 million in overpayments on Obamacare tax credits last year, and one top senator says he is worried that fraudsters will exploi", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "IRS may never recoup Obamacare tax credit overpayments totaling nearly"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdce2e\"", "article_summary": "A quirk in the law means the IRS will never be able to recoup nearly $350 million in overpayments on Obamacare tax credits last year, and one top senator says he is worried that fraudsters will exploit the loophole to wring more cash out of the government.\nThe Affordable Care Act sets a cap on the top repayment amount, so consumers don\u2019t get sticker shock at tax time.\nThe IRS couldn\u2019t say what the average overpayment was for the 400,000 or so customers who didn\u2019t have to make full repayments.\nTop Republicans hoping to repeal Obamacare say the overpayment issue is another symptom of a confusing law that puts the burden on low- and middle-income Americans and is proving susceptible to fraud.\nBecause most exchange members received higher incomes \u2014 through promotions or better jobs \u2014 they have to repay the IRS."}
