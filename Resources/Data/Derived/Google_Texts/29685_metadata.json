History proves the opposite.\n\nIt was said with all the certainty that defines the Master of the Cable News Universe.\n\n\u201cAll I can tell is you is Abe Lincoln would not have done it,\u201d Bill O\u2019Reilly said Tuesday night.\n\n\u201cIt,\u201d of course, was President Obama\u2019s appearance on Between Two Ferns, the Zach Galifianakis-hosted Web show that streams on funnyordie.com. Obama had chosen the venue to urge younger viewers to sign up for heath-care coverage. (Without younger participants, the whole structure of the Affordable Care Act turns shaky at best.) And Obama was fully engaged in the atmospherics of the program: snapping back at Galifianakis, grimacing with exasperation at the host\u2019s scornful treatment of the health-care website, feigning shock at the \u201creveal\" that the broadcast had been done inside the White House itself.)\n\nSo is the author of Killing Lincoln right in his assertion that \u201cLincoln wouldn\u2019t have done it?\u201d More broadly, did Obama cross some line of dignity that other presidents would have rejected?\n\nNot hardly.\n\nWhat presidents do\u2014what almost all politicians do\u2014is use whatever method of communication gives then the best chance to connect with the citizenry. Methods\u2014and standards\u2014change over the decades: Lincoln would have understood a \u201cwebsite\u201d to mean a home for spiders\u2014but the attraction of \u201cunconventional\u201d means of communication is a constant.\n\nFor Lincoln, that method was storytelling. He used them to illustrate a political point, or, more frequently, to humanize himself with his audience. Long before analysts noted the appeal of \u201cself-deprecating humor:\u201d Lincoln was telling audiences: \u201cI feel like I once did when I met a woman riding horseback in the woods. As I stopped to let her pass, she also stopped, and, looking at me intently, said: \u2018I do believe you are the ugliest man I ever saw.\u2019 Said I, \u2018Madam, you are probably right, but I can\u2019t help it!\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said she, \u2018You can\u2019t help it, but you might stay at home!\u2019\u201d\n\nMany of his stories reflected his roots as a salt-of-the-earth rail-splitting everyman\u2014an image, by the way, that icon was careful to cultivate. Historian Harold Holzer has written: \"Lincoln's admirers loved his down-to-earth style and earthy way with a comic tale.\u201d And not all of his stories were fit for family consumption. In the movie Lincoln, the president regales his friends with what is euphemistically labeled \u201cscatological\u201d humor (spotting a picture in the bathroom of a home during a visit to London, Lincoln tells his British host that he understands because \u201cnothing makes an Englishman shit quicker than the sight of George Washington.\u201d\n\nLincoln\u2019s humor, as Holzer notes, was not an unalloyed political asset. \u201cFoes leaped on such qualities as evidence of Lincoln's coarseness and lack of dignity.\u201d A cartoon published during the Civil War shows \u201cColumbia\u201d\u2014a symbol of the nation then as familiar as Uncle Sam\u2014demanding the return of her \u201c500,000 dead,\u201d and Lincoln responds by saying: \u201cThat reminds me of a funny story.\u201d\n\nIndeed. Presidents and potential presidents have often been accused of crossing some line of propriety. Campaigning itself was once thought of as beneath the dignity of the land. In 1860, the Jonesboro (Illinois) Gazette scorned Sen. Stephen Douglas for \u201cgoing about peddling his opinions as a tin man peddles his wares\u2026 small business it is for a candidate for the presidency to be strolling around the country begging for votes like a town constable.\u201d Flash forward a century to Sen. John F. Kennedy, Democratic nominee for president, appearing on The Tonight Show as a worshipful Jack Paar asks questions that make a sotfball feel like a rock. Leap ahead eight more years, and there is Richard Nixon on Laugh-In asking self-mockingly, \"Sock it to ME?\"\n\nMove ahead another quarter-century and there is Bill Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, appearing on Arsenio Hall\u2019s late-night television show, sporting sunglasses and a tenor sax, performing \u201cHeartbreak Hotel\u201d in recognition of his nickname: Elvis. And after winning the White House, Clinton went on Don Imus\u2019s radio show, where he traded jokes about the purpose of AstroTurf in the back of his pickup truck.\n\nA decade later, George W. Bush presented a slide show at the White House Correspondents Association dinner, an event covered by C-SPAN. One of the pictures showed Vice President Dick Cheney outside the Oval Office, hands cupped in front of his groin.\n\n\u201cDick,\" the president said, \u201cI hope you're not doing what it looks like you're doing.\u201d\n\nBeyond the obvious reason for such \u201ctransgressive\u201d political behavior, appearing on Leno, Letterman, The Daily Show, The View, Howard Stern, and other outlets is now a standard method of conveying \u201cregular guy\u201d status. Candidates and officeholders sometimes make a tradeoff: I\u2019ll play along, but then I want the chance to make a point. After Clinton played his sax on Arsenio Hall, he sat down and talked about the problems of crime and poverty. On Ferns, Obama urged his viewers to sign up for health-care insurance, which apparently led to a significant spike in inquiries.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "greenfield64"}, "keywords": "Google, Barack Obama, u.s. poli, Abraham Lincoln, Obamacare", "publicationDate": 201403121748, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "description": "Bill O\u2019Reilly attacked President Obama for making a viral video, saying the Great Emancipator wouldn\u2019t stoop so low.
