Lexington, KY – A new poll again indicates that Kentuckians marginally approve of the state health-insurance exchange created under the federal health-reform law, but clearly disapprove of the law itself.

The poll, taken Aug. 7-10, surveyed Kentuckians who said they were likely to vote in the Nov. 4 election for the U.S. Senate. After questions about the Senate race, President Obama and the 2015 governor’s race, would-be voters were asked, “Do you approve or disapprove of the Affordable Care Act?” then “Do you approve or disapprove of Kynect?” The terms were not defined; the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is widely known as Obamacare, so opinion of the president influences opinion of the law.

Fifty-one percent said they disapproved of the law, while 34 percent said they approved and 14 percent said they were not sure. But regarding Kynect, the brand for the insurance exchange, 34 percent said they approved, 27 percent said they disapproved and 40 percent said they weren’t sure. The poll’s error margin, which applies to each figure, was plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.

The more liberal voters were, the more likely they were to approve of the reform law and the insurance exchange. Among moderate voters, 47 percent approved of both, while 36 percent disapproved of the law and only 17 percent disapproved of Kynect. The remainders were undecided.

Women and Democrats were more likely to approve of both measures. Independents disapproved of the reform law more strongly than Republicans did, and were evenly divided about Kynect, but they were only 10 percent of the total, so the error margin for their results is almost 10 percentage points.
