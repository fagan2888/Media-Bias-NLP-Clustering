This is the most recent installment of the \u201cPrimary Sources\u201d survey conducted by Scholastic Inc. and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (a key Common Core supporter), and it focuses on the new English language arts and math standards, which most states have adopted and are now implementing. The organizations\u2019 larger survey of public school teachers took place in July 2013, on a broad range of educational topics. A year later, Scholastic followed up with nearly 1,700 of the surveyed teachers at the elementary, middle, and high school levels in states where the Common Core is being implemented. Among the highlights: The percentage of teachers who say they feel prepared to teach the Common Core climbed to 79 percent, up from 71 percent in 2013.\n\nMore teachers described the implementation as challenging: 81 percent compared with 73 percent last year.\n\nEnthusiasm for the Common Core declined to 68 percent from 73 percent last year. However, among teachers who have worked with the standards for at least a year, 86 percent described themselves as enthusiastic about the implementation. The last finding is consistent with recent surveys of other educators, suggesting that confidence in the Common Core is higher among educators in states that were early adopters.\n\nHere are a few of the takeaways that struck me: This is not a theoretical debate: Of the teachers surveyed, two-thirds said implementation of the new standards is either mostly or fully complete in their districts. That\u2019s compared to less than half\u201445 percent\u2014of survey respondents in 2013. In other words, while the political fighting continues outside the classroom, Common Core is already the daily reality for millions of public school students in more than 40 states. Margery Mayer, the president of Scholastic Education, told me she was encouraged that when it comes to the day-to-day work of the new standards, the outlook among the surveyed teachers is more positive than might be gleaned from many of the media reports. \u201cIf you actually talk to the teachers, more of them feel it\u2019s going well,\u201d Mayer said. \u201cThey\u2019re seeing their students do better work \u2026 there\u2019s more critical thinking and discourse in the classroom. That\u2019s the Common Core becoming established.\u201d The higher the grade level, the harder the transition: Compared with their peers at middle and high school level, elementary school teachers were significantly more likely to say they\u2019ve seen positive changes in their students\u2019 abilities since the new standards were added: Percentage of Teachers Who Have Seen a Positive Change in Their Students\u2019 Abilities as a Result of Implementing Common Core State Standards Scholastic\n\nThe Common Core is predicated on the expectation that students will develop skills and knowledge that grow and deepen with each successive year of instruction. It makes sense that the progress could be easier in lower grades. Here\u2019s another way to think about it: Many high school teachers are, in theory, being asked to build a house without a foundation, since their students were presumably not taught a curriculum aligned with the Common Core for most of their prior academic career. Robert Pondiscio, a vice president at the conservative-leaning Thomas B. Fordham Institute, worded it nicely in a piece on the challenge of teaching students to engage in the \u201cclose reading\u201d Common Core requires: \u201cBackground knowledge is intended to be built systematically over time and across subjects\u2014neither disregarded or backfilled in the minutes before students begin reading a complex text.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "While the public remains divided on the new standards, educators are increasingly optimistic.", "author": "Emily Richmond", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "While the public remains divided on the new standards, educators are increasingly optimistic.", "title": "Are Teachers Warming Up to the Common Core?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/10/817706132_6b89c15a96_z/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/10/are-teachers-warming-up-to-the-common-core/381135/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdea7f\"", "article_summary": "Among the highlights: The percentage of teachers who say they feel prepared to teach the Common Core climbed to 79 percent, up from 71 percent in 2013.\nEnthusiasm for the Common Core declined to 68 percent from 73 percent last year.\nA year later, Scholastic followed up with nearly 1,700 of the surveyed teachers at the elementary, middle, and high school levels in states where the Common Core is being implemented.\nThe organizations\u2019 larger survey of public school teachers took place in July 2013, on a broad range of educational topics.\nThe last finding is consistent with recent surveys of other educators, suggesting that confidence in the Common Core is higher among educators in states that were early adopters."}
