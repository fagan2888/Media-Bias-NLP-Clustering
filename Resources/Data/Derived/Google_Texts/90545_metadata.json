It was simultaneously the best night Danilo Gallinari had in a year-and-a-half. Those two scenarios are intertwined.\n\nThe Nuggets had been, and will continue to be, cautious with Gallinari. But in returning from a marathon torn-ACL saga, he answered a lot of questions and alleviated a lot of concerns about what kind of player he\u2019d return to be \u2013 in just 14 power-packed minutes.\n\nThe line: 17 points and four rebounds in 14 minutes. Gallinari shot 5-of-9 from the field, 2-of-4 from the 3-point line and 5-of-7 from the free throw line. It was as if he never missed a beat. But perhaps just as important were his rebounds, because they lent credence to the constant assertions that his surgically-repaired knee was at least as good, if not better than before he injured it.\n\nThere are other hurdles to get over, no doubt. He\u2019s got to play more minutes, he\u2019s got to play on short rest or in back-to-backs. He\u2019s got to put that knee through month-over-month of stressful playing to see if it is in fact okay. And there is a settling in period as well. Gallinari was no doubt pumped up to get back into action, and the adrenaline carried him to a high quality performance in an extremely important night.\n\nThe day before, Gallinari ended a practice by consecutively scoring over every different defender he faced in his six-man group in a one-one-on drill. He flexed out his chest in celebration of the conquest as his teammates whooped and hollered around him.\n\nThat was a big moment. Friday night was bigger. Shaw had plans laid out last season for Gallinari\u2019s arrival, only it never came. Friday\u2019s display pushed Shaw from wish list mode to giddy about what a huge future this season has in store. Gallinari was the second-leading scorer on a team that won 57 games that season, when he last hit the hardwood. If he is able to duplicate that success, the Nuggets stand to be much better than NBA prognosticators think they will be.\n\nFollow Chris Dempsey on Twitter @dempseypost or email him at cdempsey@denverpost.com", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Brian Shaw,Chris Dempsey,Danilo Gallinari,NBA,Nuggets", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/2014/10/11/danilo-gallinaris-big-night-huge-boost-nuggets-hopes/11746/", "site_name": "Nuggets Ink", "image": "http://local.denverpost.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/denverpost.png?v=21060130", "type": "blog", "title": "Danilo Gallinari's big night a huge boost for the Nuggets"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "title": "Danilo Gallinari\u2019s big night a huge boost for Nuggets hopes", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/2014/10/11/danilo-gallinaris-big-night-huge-boost-nuggets-hopes/11746/", "image": "http://local.denverpost.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/denverpost.png?v=21060130", "creator": "@dempseyPost", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Danilo Gallinari had a huge game for the Nuggets in his return from ACL surgery."}, "article_summary": "It was simultaneously the best night Danilo Gallinari had in a year-and-a-half.\nFriday night was the best loss in Brian Shaw\u2019s short career with the Nuggets.\nHe\u2019s got to play more minutes, he\u2019s got to play on short rest or in back-to-backs.\nFriday\u2019s display pushed Shaw from wish list mode to giddy about what a huge future this season has in store.\nIf he is able to duplicate that success, the Nuggets stand to be much better than NBA prognosticators think they will be."}
