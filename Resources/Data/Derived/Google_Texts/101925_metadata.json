Otherwise, \u201cNah,\u201d Jenkins said, \u201cno talking.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the biggest competition yet between a couple guys who grew up trying to beat each other in everything. While the Wildcats-Tar Heels matchup might be a no-lose situation for the Britt family, for the players involved there will definitely be only one winner.\n\n\u201cWhoever wins the game, obviously the other one is going to be hurt and going to feel bad,\u201d Britt said. \u201cThat\u2019ll be permanent bragging rights for the rest of our lives.\u201d\n\nJenkins and Britt met as 10-year-olds playing AAU basketball in the Washington D.C. area. Eventually, Jenkins started playing for a team coached by Britt\u2019s father and spending lots of time at the Britts\u2019 home \u2014 especially when Jenkins\u2019 mother, Felicia, was spending almost all of her time at the hospital with her ailing infant daughter. Kori was 11 months old when she died.\n\nWhen Felicia Jenkins, a former college basketball player, got a job coaching at Benedict College in Columbia, South Carolina, she felt it would be best for Kris to stay with the Britts in Maryland permanently. In 2007, the Britts became Jenkins\u2019 legal guardians.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been the greatest decision that\u2019s ever happened in my life,\u201d Jenkins said.\n\nVillanova coach Jay Wright said Britt, not Jenkins, was his priority when he took a recruiting visit to the Britt home.\n\n\u201cWe liked Kris, but we thought he\u2019s overweight and he\u2019s not going to do all the stuff we do,\u201d Wright said.\n\nBut the 6-foot-6 Jenkins, who weighed as much as 280 pounds back in high school, liked what he heard from Wright. He ended up committing to Villanova, and dropping 40 pounds, and Britt chose North Carolina.\n\nWhen the Tar Heels and Wildcats played each other in the first round of the 2013 NCAA Tournament, Jenkins and Britt watched the game together, rooting for their future schools \u2014 and not talking to each other. They trash texted each other and didn\u2019t even sit on the same couch.\n\n\u201cThat was fun,\u201d Britt said. North Carolina won 78-71.\n\nThe Britts have spent the past few weeks bouncing around the country watching their sons play. Last weekend, they managed to attend all four Elite Eight games, two in Philadelphia (where North Carolina played) and two in Louisville (were Villanova played). Jenkins even attended North Carolina\u2019s East Regional championship victory against Notre Dame.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Brotherly battle between Jenkins, Britt for national title", "title": "Brotherly battle between Jenkins, Britt for national title", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Brotherly battle between Jenkins, Britt for national title", "title": "Brotherly battle between Jenkins, Britt for national title", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/04/03/brotherly_battle_between_jenkins_britt_for_national_title/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/04/ncaa-championship-basketball.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Brotherly battle between Jenkins, Britt for national title", "title": "Brotherly battle between Jenkins, Britt for national title", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/04/ncaa-championship-basketball.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Ralph D.
