SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER The meetings took place at least 427 times. The data used spans from Obama\u2019s first month in office in 2009 until October 2015, and includes government meetings with representatives of Google-affiliated companies Tomorrow Ventures and Civis Analytics. The Google employee with the most visits is the company\u2019s head of public policy, Johanna Shelton, who paid the White House 128 visits.\n\nGoogle claims it\u2019s entirely normal for its representatives and affiliates to make hundreds of White House visits, to discuss numerous topics of interest, such as patent reform, education, Internet censorship, cyber security, and how an all-powerful search engine could tip a close presidential election by fooling around with news feeds and query results.\n\nAnother topic of great interest to Google is the FCC\u2019s proposed \u201cset-top box\u201d regulation, which the Daily Mail notes has actually been denounced by an AT&T executive as a \u201cGoogle proposal.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s because the plan that would force cable and satellite providers to unlock the boxes that decode their content, allowing companies like Google to sell their boxes to customers, who are currently obliged to lease them from the providers.\n\nWhatever the merits or shortcomings of this plan might be, it\u2019s clearly of great interest to Google, which could suddenly find itself in a position to muscle into a billion-dollar market, gain a new method of harvesting valuable data about consumers, and maybe even begin undermining the business model of cable and satellite providers.\n\nThe Intercept refers to the set-top box legislation as just the latest example of Google\u2019s White House clout coming in handy, also mentioning the way a presidential commission squashed the U.S. version of an antitrust complaint currently vexing the tech giant in Europe.\n\n\u201cIn just the past few years, Google has provided diplomatic assistance to the administration through expanding internet access in Cuba; collaborated with the Department of Housing and Urban Development to bring Google Fiber into public housing; used Google resources to monitor droughts in real time; and even captured 360-degree views of White House interiors,\u201d The Intercept writes, portraying the exceptionally close relationship between the Obama presidency and Google as a mutually beneficial relationship without parallel. Google even helped bail the Administration out after the disastrous launch of the ObamaCare website.\n\nNo matter what Google might say to downplay the importance of that relationship, The Intercept notes that no other company has a remotely comparable White House presence.\n\nThe Intercept describes Google as practically becoming the White House\u2019s IT Help Desk, which is both logical and troubling, because \u201cthe government is supposed to be regulating Google as a private business, not continually asking it for favors.\u201d\n\nNo blatant charge of corruption is made, but that\u2019s the problem: in the relationship between the White House and tech giants, it\u2019s hard to say where cooperation ends and corruption begins. Certainly if we were talking about oil industry giants frequenting a Republican White House, and making equally plausible claims about their expertise in energy matters being invaluable, the media wouldn\u2019t buy it for a second.\n\n\u201cWhen the federal government and a private company share the same worldview, get the same insights from the same groups of people, the policy drift can occur with nobody explicitly choosing the direction. It just seems like the right thing to do,\u201d as The Intercept adroitly puts it. \u201cAnd there is no doubt that Google\u2019s rise in Washington has coincided with public policy that is friendlier to the company.\u201d\n\nThe big issue transfixing much of American politics at the moment is corruption, under a variety of names: inequality, privilege, cronyism, exploitation\u2026 and yet, a gigantic corporation with wide-ranging global interests can maintain a cozy relationship with the President that is only now being closely examined, with less than a year to go before the end of the presidency.\n\n\u201cGoogle has long been a strong advocate of transparency in government, business, and even users\u2019 private lives. It has not, however, been transparent about its own dealings with the government. These datasets show how Google has enjoyed unparalleled access to the Obama Administration at a time when the company\u2019s influence on government, public policies, and our lives is incomparable to any corporation in history,\u201d said Campaign for Accountability Executive Director Anne Weismann about her organization\u2019s project to track Google\u2019s influence on government.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Google Scores 427 White House Meetings During Obama Presidency", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Google Scores 427 White House Meetings During Obama Presidency", "title": "Google Scores 427 White House Meetings During Obama Presidency - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/04/Obama-Google-AP.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/04/25/google-scores-427-white-house-meetings-obama-presidency/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Google Scores 427 White House Meetings During Obama Presidency", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/04/Obama-Google-AP.jpg", "title": "Google Scores 427 White House Meetings During Obama Presidency - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "barack obama, Google, silicon valley, White House,Big Government, Obama, Tech,Google", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "White House", "published_time": "2016-04-25T17:45:46-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,Obama,Tech"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "The Google employee with the most visits is the company\u2019s head of public policy, Johanna Shelton, who paid the White House 128 visits.\nNo matter what Google might say to downplay the importance of that relationship, The Intercept notes that no other company has a remotely comparable White House presence.\nCertainly if we were talking about oil industry giants frequenting a Republican White House, and making equally plausible claims about their expertise in energy matters being invaluable, the media wouldn\u2019t buy it for a second.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe UK Daily Mail reports on the remarkably close relationship between Google and the White House:Numbers crunched by the Campaign for Accountability and the Intercept show 169 Google employees have met with 182 government officials in the White House.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER The meetings took place at least 427 times."}
