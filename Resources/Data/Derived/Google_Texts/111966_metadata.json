According to the Wall Street Journal, the 2012 Republican nominee for President told donors in New York on Friday that he was considering yet another run for the White House in 2016.\n\nWhile Romney, who also ran for President in 2008, was scorned by many Republicans during his campaign as a flip-flopper with no real base in his party, many in the GOP have embraced him after his loss. After all, with the initial failures of the health care exchanges under the Affordable Care Act and the Russian invasion of Crimea, many controversial statements by the former Massachusetts governor now seem omniscient.\n\nHe\u2019s also been humanized thanks to a well-received documentary that showed an authentic side to a candidate who, at times, seemed battery-operated.\n\nRomney, who last year denied he was running again several times, still has not made a firm decision on whether he throws his hat into the ring.\n\nInstead, the former Massachusetts governor\u2019s statement seems as much as a way to slow the momentum coalescing around former Florida Governor Jeb Bush and prop the door open for Romney to make a decision in the coming months.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019ll work and there are new hurdles to consider.\n\nIf Romney run for a third time, he\u2019d potentially be in a field jam-packed with establishment Republicans, including Bush, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and Florida Senator Marco Rubio among others.\n\nThe former Massachusetts governor also would face a major historical obstacle: losing major party nominees don\u2019t have a good track record in making comeback bids.\n\nThe last one to even mount a campaign was George McGovern, the Democratic nominee in 1972, who mounted a quixotic comeback attempt in 1984. In fact, with the exception of Richard Nixon\u2019s win in 1968, the only time a former major party nominee has since been elected to the presidency since the Civil War was when former President Grover Cleveland won his 1892 rematch for the White House against Benjamin Harrison.\n\nMore recent historical precedent though has involved losing major party nominees like Gerald Ford, Al Gore and John Kerry simply flirting with another bid before backing down.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "bencjacobs"}, "keywords": "Mitt Romney, u.s. poli, New York City,New York,United States, 2016", "publicationDate": 201501092245, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "description": "Two time presidential candidate Mitt Romney told donors in New York he might run again.", "pageNum": 1, "title": "Why Mitt Cant Quit: Romney Tells Donors He Might Run, Again, Again", "tags": "entity:person/mitt_romney,topic:politics,entity:city/new_york_city_new_york_united_states,entity:event/2016_election", "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Why Mitt Can\u2019t Quit: Romney Tells Donors He Might Run, Again, Again\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/01/09/romney-tells-donors-he-might-run-again-again.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/01/09/romney-tells-donors-he-might-run-again-again/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/47361528.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/01/09/romney-tells-donors-he-might-run-again-again\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-01-09T22:45:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"Politics\",\"author\":\"Ben Jacobs\",\"tags\":[\"mitt_romney\",\"politics\",\"new_york_city_new_york_united_states\",\"2016_election\"]}", "news_keywords": "Mitt Romney, US Politics, New York City New York United States, 2016 election", "sectionTaxanomies": "politics", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "Ben Jacobs", "article": {"section": "politics", "published_time": "2015-01-09T22:45:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/ben-jacobshtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/01/09/romney-tells-donors-he-might-run-again-again", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "Two time presidential candidate Mitt Romney told donors in New York he might run again.", "title": "Why Mitt Can\u2019t Quit: Romney Tells Donors He Might Run, Again, Again", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/01/09/romney-tells-donors-he-might-run-again-again.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/01/09/romney-tells-donors-he-might-run-again-again/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1420845854987.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "authorIds": "/etc/authors/b/ben-jacobs", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "article_summary": "DO OVERTwo time presidential candidate Mitt Romney told donors in New York he might run again.\nMore recent historical precedent though has involved losing major party nominees like Gerald Ford, Al Gore and John Kerry simply flirting with another bid before backing down.\nThe former Massachusetts governor also would face a major historical obstacle: losing major party nominees don\u2019t have a good track record in making comeback bids.\nIf Romney run for a third time, he\u2019d potentially be in a field jam-packed with establishment Republicans, including Bush, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and Florida Senator Marco Rubio among others.\nLike Richard Nixon or Freddy Krueger, it seems impossible to keep Mitt Romney down."}
