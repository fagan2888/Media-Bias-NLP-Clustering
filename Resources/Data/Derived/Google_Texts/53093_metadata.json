Ted Cruz was booed off the stage at a gathering of Middle Eastern Christians for making pro-Israel comments, a New York bishop stood before the frantic audience to lead a prayer for him.\n\nIn an interview with The Daily Signal today, Bishop Gregory Mansour of the Maronite Eparchy of Saint Maron of Brooklyn said he first rushed after Cruz as he departed the Omni Shoreham in Washington. Mansour said he hoped to reassure Cruz after some attending the summit, called In Defense of Christians, had booed and heckled the Texas Republican. Cruz chose to leave the stage.\n\n\u201cI wanted to explain the situation because I felt that he put his finger in a wound for us and it was very unfortunate some of the response people made toward him,\u201d Mansour told The Daily Signal. \u201cBut it was also very unfortunate that it seems like he came out slugging. And it was a train wreck waiting to happen.\u201d\n\nMansour, whose diocese serves Maronite Catholics in 16 states and the District of Columbia, said he then led the audience of about 900 in prayer for Cruz and the gathering as a way to calm the tension.\n\n>>> \u2018Surprise\u2019: Christians Boo Ted Cruz\u2019s Pro-Israel Remarks\n\nCruz, a keynote speaker last night at the event billed as raising awareness for persecuted religious minorities in the Middle East, said: \u201cThose who hate Israel hate America, and those who hate Jews hate Christians.\u201d\n\nAs Cruz left the hotel, Mansour said, he told the senator that he would pray for him.\n\nThis article has been modified.", "article_metadata": {"description": "After Sen.
