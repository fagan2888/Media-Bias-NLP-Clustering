Real leaders back up their words with action, and Matt Duchene is showing more this season that he is one of the Avalanche\u2019s leaders.\n\nWhen the Avs needed a top forward to get going, to lead the way out of a slump that was starting to get serious despite the season still being early, Duchene was the guy. Starting with the first period of Thursday\u2019s game at Madison Square Garden against the New York Rangers, through his late-game goal that won Saturday\u2019s in New Jersey against the Devils, Duchene led the way to two desperately needed victories.\n\nIt is probably a miscarriage of sports justice that Duchene, in his sixth season with the Avs, doesn\u2019t at least wear an \u201cA\u201d as an alternate captain. But Duchene doesn\u2019t need a letter on his sweater to prove he\u2019s the team\u2019s on-ice leader.\n\nDuchene, only 23 still, is a good talker, a go-to guy for reporters needing a quote. After Tuesday\u2019s dreadful Avs performance in a 6-0 loss to the New York Islanders, Duchene went on a mini-rant about the team\u2019s play to that point. The next game was important for Duchene, because a flat performance might make his words seem empty.\n\nInstead, he led the way with skill, but also hard, grinding play against the Rangers and earned the game\u2019s No. 1 star with a goal and assist.\n\nAfter scoring the game-winner Saturday, Duchene spoke of the need for the Avs to start getting even hungrier now that a little success is coming their way again.\n\n\u201cWe tried to will our way through this. It hasn\u2019t come easy, not for one second,\u201d Duchene said. \u201cLast year, if we played the way we did against the Rangers, we score five or six goals and win easy. This year, it\u2019s just not coming that easy. But these are the types of wins that (help). We\u2019re pushing hard, we\u2019re working hard, and we\u2019re going to get through this because we\u2019re a strong, character team.\u201d\n\nDuchene said it\u2019s been a struggle for this team to find its identity. Maybe it wanted to be too much of a skating, skill team early on instead of having more of a blue collar work ethic. Somewhere in the middle is where he thinks the team is best served.\n\n\u201cI think these last couple of games, we\u2019ve found more of the way we need to play,\u201d he said. \u201cBut by no means are we thinking everything is all fine again. We know we still just have to keep our heads down and keep working at it.\u201d\n\nSaid Avs coach Patrick Roy: \u201cDutchy is skating very well for us. That was a big goal for our team that he scored, and it shows you that good things happen when you go to the net.\u201d\n\nAdrian Dater: adater@denverpost.com or at twitter.com/adater", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "No \u201cA\u201d needed: Matt Duchene quietly leads Avalanche", "title": "No \u201cA\u201d needed: Matt Duchene quietly leads Avalanche", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/11/16/no-a-needed-matt-duchene-quietly-leads-avalanche/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141116__dc8c89720fd5882d650f6a706700c96cp1.jpg", "height": 471}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141116__dc8c89720fd5882d650f6a706700c96cp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-16T10:20:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T15:28:11+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3178\"", "article_summary": "Real leaders back up their words with action, and Matt Duchene is showing more this season that he is one of the Avalanche\u2019s leaders.\nBut Duchene doesn\u2019t need a letter on his sweater to prove he\u2019s the team\u2019s on-ice leader.\n\u201cI think these last couple of games, we\u2019ve found more of the way we need to play,\u201d he said.\nInstead, he led the way with skill, but also hard, grinding play against the Rangers and earned the game\u2019s No.\nDuchene, only 23 still, is a good talker, a go-to guy for reporters needing a quote."}
