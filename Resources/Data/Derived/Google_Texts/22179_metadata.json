One way it does that is to force its warehouse workers to wait a long time to leave work, without getting paid. And that\u2019s just fine with the Obama administration, which continues to have a blind spot when it comes to decent pay and working conditions at Amazon.\n\nYesterday the Supreme Court heard a case (Integrity Staffing Solutions v. Busk) in which workers are suing the temp firm that staff\u2019s Amazon warehouses. The workers are in court because they don\u2019t get paid for the time they are forced to stand on line for a security check when they leave work to be sure they haven\u2019t stolen anything. The security screening itself reveals the poor working conditions and lack of respect that Amazon has for its workers. Workers who are well paid and have job security will not take the risk of stealing. The lack of pay adds costly insult to their injury.\n\nThe legal issues revolve around whether the security screenings, which can take 20 minutes or more, are \u201cintegral and indispensable\u201d to the job, which would trigger pay under the Fair Labor Standards Act. Amazon certainly thinks so; the screenings aren\u2019t optional. Still the firm, which pays warehouse workers around $11 or $12 an hour, cheaps out by denying the workers pay when they are waiting on line to leave.\n\nAs Jesse Busk, the lead plaintiff in the case, told The Huffington Post, \u201cYou\u2019re just standing there, and everyone wants to get home. It was not comfortable. There could be hundreds of people waiting at the end of the shift.\u201d\n\nWhile President Obama has made numerous passionate speeches about giving Americans a raise, his administration is taking Amazon\u2019s side at the Supreme Court, filing an amicus brief, alongside the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other business lobbies.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The president has been adamant about helping American workers, so why is he throwing his support behind Jeff Bezos?", "title": "The Obama administration\u2019s shameful defense of Amazon\u2019s low pay", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The president has been adamant about helping American workers, so why is he throwing his support behind Jeff Bezos?", "title": "The Obama administration\u2019s shameful defense of Amazon\u2019s low pay", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/10/12/the_obama_administrations_shameful_defense_of_amazons_low_pay_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/jeff_bezos2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The president has been adamant about helping American workers, so why is he throwing his support behind Jeff Bezos?", "title": "The Obama administration\u2019s shameful defense of Amazon\u2019s low pay", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/jeff_bezos2.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Richard Kirsch", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, amazon, Jeff Bezos, Next New Deal, Obama, Obama administration", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcabed\"", "article_summary": "Topics: amazon, Jeff Bezos, Next New Deal, Obama, Obama administration, Business News, Politics NewsThis originally appeared on Next New DealAmazon\u2019s business model is based on quick easy buying and low prices.\nStill the firm, which pays warehouse workers around $11 or $12 an hour, cheaps out by denying the workers pay when they are waiting on line to leave.\nAnd that\u2019s just fine with the Obama administration, which continues to have a blind spot when it comes to decent pay and working conditions at Amazon.\nThe security screening itself reveals the poor working conditions and lack of respect that Amazon has for its workers.\nOne way it does that is to force its warehouse workers to wait a long time to leave work, without getting paid."}
