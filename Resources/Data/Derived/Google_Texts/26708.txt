Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush said he admired outgoing House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) “greatly” in a Fox News Sunday interview.

“I admire John Boehner greatly,” Bush said. “He is a great public servant. He left at the apex of his time in service to his country with the Pope speaking to Congress. I think people are going to miss him in the long run because he’s a person that is focused on soling problems.”

When host Chris Wallace asked Bush if Boehner’s resignation will be good or bad for conservatives, Bush said “we’ll see how it plays out… what we need is a conservative president that can work with Congress.”

“We wouldn’t have these problems if you had a president that actually would commit to passing a budget, would commit to… repealing Obamacare, reforming our taxes.”

Boehner reportedly urged Bush to make his presidential run and even told Jay Leno in 2014 that Bush would be a “great president.”
