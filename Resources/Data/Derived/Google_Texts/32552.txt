UPDATE: Due to snow in the Washington area, this Kaiser Family Foundation scheduled event in Washington, D.C., is cancelled. We apologize for the inconvenience and will let you know if we are able to reschedule the event at a later date.

The Affordable Care Act’s (ACA) major coverage reforms have created new pathways to insurance coverage for millions of Americans, including those with HIV. How have these changes affected coverage and access to care for people with HIV? Who has gained new coverage and who has been left out? How do state decisions around Medicaid expansion impact access to care for people with HIV? How have the programs that serve people with HIV, particularly the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program, adapted and been affected by the ACA? What barriers have been faced and how have these been overcome?

On Jan. 27 at 9:30 a.m. ET, the Kaiser Family Foundation will hold a policy briefing to discuss these questions with a panel of experts from the HIV community. Additionally, the Foundation will release new research on estimated costs an HIV positive enrollee could face in the ACA marketplace, as well as video profiles of people with HIV speaking about the impact of the ACA on their coverage and care.

Panelists will include John Carlo, CEO of AIDS Arms Dallas; Laura Cheever, Associate Administrator, HIV/AIDS Bureau, HRSA; Shandora Lane, a Ryan White client who lives with HIV in Atlanta, Ga; and Tim Westmoreland, Professor from Practice, Georgetown University Law Center. Lindsey Dawson, Senior Policy Analyst with the HIV Policy team at the Kaiser Family Foundation, will provide an update on the Foundation’s work on this topic. Jen Kates, Foundation Vice President and Director of Global Health and HIV Policy, will offer opening remarks and moderate the panel discussion.
