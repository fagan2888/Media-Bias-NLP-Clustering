For this study, they focused instead on female-to-male people.\n\nTheir data came from a 2008-2009 survey of 1,711 female-to-male transgender people from the U.S. and its territories. Most were ages 25 to 44.\n\nOver three quarters lived full-time as their nonbirth gender. A similar proportion reported some type of medical gender transition.\n\nAsked about experiences in doctors' offices or hospitals, 28 percent said they'd been denied equal treatment, about 32 percent reported verbal harassment, and about 1 percent reported physical assaults.\n\nShires emphasized that it's not clear who discriminated against the participants. Additionally, she said, the results may not apply to the entire transgender community.\n\nOne researcher not involved with the study told Reuters Health by email that she wasn't surprised by the findings.\n\nIf anything, the study may underestimate the problem, \"because the sample was skewed towards young, white, college-educated people with jobs and private health insurance,\" said Dr. Laura Erickson-Schroth, a psychiatrist at New York University in New York City.\n\n\"If 42 percent of that group is reporting discrimination, the number may be even higher for others,\" said Erickson-Schroth, who is the editor of the book Trans Bodies, Trans Selves.\n\nA next step, Shires said, would be to find ways to improve healthcare experiences for transgender people.\n\nFor example, she said, it's still difficult for many transgender people to identify themselves on medical forms as anything other than male or female.\n\n\"At every point in the healthcare system if you\u2019re transgender there is no place for you,\" she said. \"There is no way to identify yourself and it\u2019s a vicious cycle.\"\n\nErickson-Schroth pointed out that 65 survey participants said they never accessed care at a doctor's office or hospital.\n\n\"Though this is a small number, I can't help but wonder if they avoided care completely because they feared harassment or discrimination,\" she said.\n\nWhile the medical community is beginning to make changes to improve care for transgender people, Erickson-Schroth said progress is slow.\n\n\"The most important step the medical community needs to take toward ending discrimination against transgender people in clinical settings is educating providers,\" she said.\n\nPrevious research found that medical schools only spend an average of five hours on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender issues. Some schools never discuss the topic at all.\n\nThe education of healthcare providers should start in school, said Erickson-Schroth, but shouldn't end there.\n\n\"It should happen in hospitals and clinics as well,\" she said.\n\nThe World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) and GLMA: Health Professionals Advancing LGBT Equality have searchable databases of providers with an interest or expertise in working with transgender people, Erickson-Schroth said.\n\nAlso, she pointed out, people can often report discrimination to clinics and hospitals, or they can contact organizations such as the National Center for Transgender Equality or the Transgender Law Center.\n\nSOURCE: http://bit.ly/1x1ube1 Health and Social Work, online March 3, 2015.\n\n(By Andrew M.
