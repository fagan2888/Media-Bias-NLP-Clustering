So, wherever and whenever I can take steps without legislation to expand opportunity for more American families, that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do.\u201d\n\nBut while the list of things he could do was positive, it was nowhere near what it would take to address what he rightly, but late in the day, called \u201cthe defining issue of our time\u201d \u2014 the failure of the modern U.S. economy to guarantee upward mobility and opportunity to the vast middle class.\n\nObama has no specific plans to do the things that might turn that trend around \u2014 tax reform that closes loopholes and lowers rates, an entitlement overhaul that shifts benefits from old people to young, a de-regulated and de-bureaucratized infrastructure and energy agenda. He mentioned such plans in only general terms, and omitted entitlement reform completely.\n\nThe truth is, the state of the union is not strong and a worried public knows it. The economic recovery is weak \u2014 only 74,000 net new jobs created last month when 250,000 a month are needed. In education, the nation\u2019s 15-year-olds rank 28th on world science tests and 36th in math. Deficits are down, but the gross national debt is still more than 100 percent of gross domestic product and is on a rising trajectory. Iran has not given up its capacity to make a nuclear weapon and the United States figures to be just another foreign power that failed to tame Afghanistan.\n\nRegardless what sugar he applies, Obama\u2019s fortunes depend on how his signature program \u2014 Obamacare \u2014 turns out. And the signs are not good. Yes, people can get insurance regardless of pre-existing conditions and young people can stay on their parents\u2019 policies until they are 26. But sign-ups under Obamacare skew old and sick, menacing the private insurance market. And millions of people are either losing their old insurance policies, seeing their premiums sky-rocket or both. Obama did not suggest any fixes.\n\nHe avoided blaming Republicans for his failures, but he\u2019s not going to get much cooperation from them this year \u2014 maybe on immigration, but probably not. And at the rate things are going, he may face both a Republican House and a Republican Senate after this year\u2019s elections. Obama tried to be upbeat, but the realities of his situation are down.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Delivering his State of the Union address on Tuesday night , President Barack Obama was vigorous, earnest, positive, non-confrontational, occasionally funny and determined to get things done.", "og": {"site_name": "Roll Call", "description": "Delivering his State of the Union address on Tuesday night , President Barack Obama was vigorous, earnest, positive, non-confrontational, occasionally funny and determined to get things done.", "title": "Despite Obama's Rhetoric, the State of the Union Is Not Strong | Kondracke", "url": "http://www.rollcall.com/news/home/sotublog-kondracke", "image": {"type": "image/png"}, "updated_time": "2014-01-29T18:49:30Z", "type": "website"}, "abstract": "Delivering his State of the Union address on Tuesday night , President Barack Obama was vigorous, earnest, positive, non-confrontational, occasionally funny and determined to get things done.", "fb": {"app_id": 1383531991672364}, "keywords": "Blog ID,Author,category,author,category,CQToday Topic,kondracke,pennsylvania-avenue,exbr", "article": {"section": "home", "published_time": "2014-01-29T18:49:30Z", "modified_time": "2014-01-29T18:49:30Z"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.rollcall.com/news/home/sotublog-kondracke", "site": "@rollcall", "description": "Delivering his State of the Union address on Tuesday night , President Barack Obama was vigorous, earnest, positive, non-confrontational, occasionally funny and determined to get things done.", "card": "summary |player (See: https://dev.twitter.com/cards/types/player We will have to submit a test and get approval before using this type)", "title": "Despite Obama's Rhetoric, the State of the Union Is Not Strong | Kondracke"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "The truth is, the state of the union is not strong and a worried public knows it.\nAnd millions of people are either losing their old insurance policies, seeing their premiums sky-rocket or both.\nObama tried to be upbeat, but the realities of his situation are down.\nDelivering his State of the Union address on Tuesday night , President Barack Obama was vigorous, earnest, positive, non-confrontational, occasionally funny and determined to get things done.\nAnd at the rate things are going, he may face both a Republican House and a Republican Senate after this year\u2019s elections."}
