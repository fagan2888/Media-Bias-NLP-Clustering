That\u2019s the first day Colorado needs a fifth starter in their rotation.\n\nBut Rockies manager Walt Weiss said that is not likely.\n\n\u201cThat would be absolute best-case scenario,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cBut we don\u2019t count on best-case scenarios.\u201d\n\nDe La Rosa will pitch a bullpen session Sunday as part of his rehab. His spring training preparation was delayed twice by a strained left groin. Now the left-hander likely needs an extended spring training game and at least one minor-league start before he\u2019s ready to return to the Rockies.\n\nWeiss said he was encouraged by De La Rosa\u2019s progress. But he\u2019s prepared to find another starting pitcher when the five-man rotation kicks in.\n\nChristian Bergman would likely replace De La Rosa. Weiss confirmed that Bergman, a second-year righty who will be on the 25-man roster on opening day in the bullpen, is an option.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Christian Bergman,Jorge De La Rosa,Spring Training", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "On the Rox", "description": "Jorge De La Rosa, who will miss the first part of the season with a groin injury, likely won't return until later in the month.", "title": "Jorge De La Rosa injury likely to delay Rockies pitching rotation", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/2015/04/04/jorge-de-la-rosa-will-likely-miss-start-of-rockies-five-man-rotation/19816/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/files/2010/02/JorgeDeLaRosa.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Jorge De La Rosa, who will miss the first part of the season with a groin injury, likely won't return until later in the month.", "title": "Jorge De La Rosa injury likely to delay Rockies pitching rotation", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/2015/04/04/jorge-de-la-rosa-will-likely-miss-start-of-rockies-five-man-rotation/19816/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/files/2010/02/JorgeDeLaRosa.jpg", "creator": "@nickgroke", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Jorge De La Rosa, who will miss the first part of the season with a groin injury, likely won't return until later in the month."}, "article_summary": "Jorge De La Rosa, who will miss the first part of the season with a groin injury, likely won\u2019t return until later in the month.\n\u201cBut we don\u2019t count on best-case scenarios.\u201dDe La Rosa will pitch a bullpen session Sunday as part of his rehab.\nChristian Bergman would likely replace De La Rosa.\nNow the left-hander likely needs an extended spring training game and at least one minor-league start before he\u2019s ready to return to the Rockies.\nHis spring training preparation was delayed twice by a strained left groin."}
