When i have liberals on this show one of the big arguments is well, you\u2019re painting with a broad brush,\u201d Maher said. \u201cOf course Saudi Arabia is backwards but what about Indonesia and Turkey and Jordan? Well, I looked up Turkey and Indonesia and Jordan and here are some of the statistics here. Sharia law, 72 percent of Indonesians favor it. Jordan \u201371 percent. Stoning of adulterers in Indonesia \u2013 48 percent popular, Jordan \u2014 67 percent. Death for leaving Islam. Jordan, 82 percent. These are their bastions of freedom and democracy. How do we get liberals and some of them are people I really used to respect \u2014 how do we get them to understand that we\u2019re the liberals in this debate? The people that are facing, shining a light on oppression and demanding that it will end \u2013 how can that not be the liberal cause? What do you say to liberals?\u201d\n\nFollow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor", "article_metadata": {"description": "Maher: Those Shining the Light on the Oppression of Islam Are the Real Liberals", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Maher: Those Shining the Light on the Oppression of Islam Are the Real Liberals", "title": "Maher: Those Shining the Light on the Oppression in Islam Are the Real Liberals - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 444, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/05/Maher516a.jpg", "height": 333}, "updated_time": "2015-05-16T08:39:30-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/05/16/maher-those-shining-the-light-on-the-oppression-of-islam-are-the-real-liberals/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Maher: Those Shining the Light on the Oppression of Islam Are the Real Liberals", "creator": "@jeff_poor", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/05/Maher516a.jpg", "title": "Maher: Those Shining the Light on the Oppression in Islam Are the Real Liberals - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Ayaan Hirsi Ali, Bill Maher, Islam,Breitbart TV, Jihad,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-05-16T08:29:40-07:00", "section": "Breitbart TV", "modified_time": "2015-05-16T08:39:30-07:00", "tag": "Islam", "categories": "Breitbart TV,Jihad"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0f33\"", "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\u201cWe know Sharia law is popular in many more countries than you even named.\nThe people that are facing, shining a light on oppression and demanding that it will end \u2013 how can that not be the liberal cause?\nWhen i have liberals on this show one of the big arguments is well, you\u2019re painting with a broad brush,\u201d Maher said.\nSharia law, 72 percent of Indonesians favor it.\nStoning of adulterers in Indonesia \u2013 48 percent popular, Jordan \u2014 67 percent."}
