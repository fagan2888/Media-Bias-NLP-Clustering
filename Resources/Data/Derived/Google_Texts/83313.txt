â€” The North Carolina State Highway Patrol says a Raleigh woman was driving drunk when tried to make an illegal turn Saturday, prompting a wreck that caused injuries to four people.

Mary Catherine Marett, 27, of 1020-A5 Avent Hill, was arrested on four felony counts of serious injury by vehicle and one count each of driving while impaired, driving with a revoked license and unsafe movement following the wreck on Tryon Road near Trailwood Drive in Raleigh around 12:30 a.m. Saturday.

State troopers said Marett was driving east on Tryon Road when she attempted to U-turn onto Trailwood and was hit by a car headed west on Tryon.

The driver of the car that hit Marett was treated and released at a nearby hospital. The driver's name and extent of injuries were not released.

One of the three passengers riding with Marett, Megan Nicole Gross, 27, was taken to UNC Hospitals in Chapel Hill, where she was listed in critical but stable condition Sunday night. Information on the other passengers was not available.

Marett was being held at the Wake County Detention Center under a $100,000 bond Sunday night.
