Carl de souza/Agence France-Presse\n\nIn Kenya\u2019s deadliest attack since 1998, 148 students and staff were killed on the campus of Garissa Unversity College on Thursday. The country\u2019s Interior Ministry said on Sunday that one of the four gunmen was the son of a Kenyan government official, whose father had reported him missing in 2014.\n\nThe attack comes over a year after the 2013 Westgate shopping center killing, which left 68 people dead in Nairobi. The Somali Islamist group al-Shabaab has claimed responsibility for both attacks.\n\nAs the country tried to make sense of the attack, a Kenyan woman named Ory Okolloh created a hashtag on Twitter: #147notjustanumber. The number of victims was still being counted when the hashtag was launched.\n\n#147notjustanumber \u2014 Ory Okolloh Mwangi (@kenyanpundit) April 4, 2015\n\nShe told the WSJ via direct message on Twitter that the hashtag was \u201can effort to humanize victims of terror.\u201d\n\nWe will name them. One by one. They are these \"young Africans\" we speak of all the time. Chasing dreams. #147notjustanumber \u2014 Ory Okolloh Mwangi (@kenyanpundit) April 4, 2015\n\nTom Vandenbosch, who lives near Brussels, Belgium, used the hashtag to share thoughts and images of students who were killed.\n\nThese bright young brothers and sisters were our future.
