MANCHESTER, England (AP) - Manchester United great Bobby Charlton is to have a stand at Old Trafford named after him in honor of his contribution to the club.

The South Stand - the side of the stadium where the dugouts and changing rooms are located - will be renamed the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand at an unveiling ceremony before the home match against Everton in the Premier League on April 2. It will mark 60 years after Charlton made his debut for United.

“This is a great honor and I am very proud - for myself and my family,” said the 78-year-old Charlton, the former England attacking midfielder who played 758 games for United and scored a club-record 249 goals.

“Manchester United has been such an important part of my life and I have so many wonderful memories of this Theatre of Dreams.”

United said the unveiling of the stand’s new name will be “attended by key figures from Sir Bobby’s life and the world of football.”

“Bobby is, quite simply, the most iconic figure in English football history,” said Ed Woodward, United’s executive vice-chairman. “A player, a diplomat, a gentleman and a tireless worker for charity, he represents everything that is good about football and Manchester United.

“Renaming the South Stand . is a fitting tribute to all that Bobby has contributed to the club both as a player and a director.”

The North Stand at Old Trafford was renamed the Sir Alex Ferguson Stand in 2011 after the club’s most successful manager.
