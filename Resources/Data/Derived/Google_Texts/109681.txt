WOODBRIDGE, Virginia — GOP presidential candidate former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee commented on the Senate’s vote Thursday night defunding Planned Parenthood and gutting key parts of Obamacare, saying, “It’s kinda better late than never.”

He added that Congress shouldn’t cave to President Obama’s veto threats.

“I think it was what they should have been doing all along,” Huckabee told reporters after a campaign rally Friday in Woodbridge, Virginia.

Many of us as Republicans believe that the purpose of having a majority was to put a backstop to President Obama’s executive overreach and to the programs that have been failures. It’s kinda better late than never. I’m hoping they continue to do similar actions.

Huckabee said Congress shouldn’t cower to Obama’s veto threat.

“Even if the president vetos it, let him take the pen out, let him explain why he’s acting against the best interest of the United States and its citizens rather than acting on their behalf,” he challenged.
