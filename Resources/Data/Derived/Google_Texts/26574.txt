Following a horrific car crash 10 years ago, Kellie Haddock lost her husband, who died instantly, and was left to deal with the unsure future of her 14-week-old son Eli. Upon being released from the ER, Haddock had to wait three painfully long days before doctors at the pediatric care unit at the Arnold Palmer Hospital were able to determine the extent of Eli’s injuries. Finally, she received news that no parent wishes to hear:

“His injuries are extensive. … If he pulls through this, he likely will not have much of a life. He will probably not be able to walk, talk, or show emotion…”

By the time Haddock arrived back at the hospital, a nurse informed her that Eli had drank seven bottles of breast milk she had been storing in the PICU and that he was still hungry. Haddock explained that she never asked for any miracles regarding her son’s health, but she couldn’t help but feel a sense of hope for Eli’s future. For the next five years, she would see Eli through the arduous steps of recovering from his injuries as a single parent.

Five years after the accident that changed Haddock’s life – and Eli’s just 14 weeks after it started – she was able to remarry with her new husband Ted, who decided to adopt Eli without hesitation. At 10 years old, Eli has far and away surpassed the expectations of his initial diagnosis. Knowing full well that Eli’s success was the result of tireless efforts by doctors, nurses, and other medical staff, Haddock knew she had a lot of people to thank. So that’s exactly what she did.
