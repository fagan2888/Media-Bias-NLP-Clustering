During a private chat today, Hillary Clinton told Denver Congresswoman Diana DeGette she’ll likely make up her mind about running for president in 2016 after the midterm elections in November.

DeGette told the former first lady/U.S. senator/secretary of state she would do whatever she could to help a Clinton campaign, said the congresswoman’s spokesman, Matt Inzeo. That’s when Clinton said she was looking at a midterm time table.

Clinton and DeGette met this morning in a room at the Colorado Convention Center before Clinton addressed the International Deli-Dairy-Bakery Association. Clinton later visited a plastics molding factory. Clinton’s visit will be capped off by a speech tonight as part of the Unique Lives & Experiences series at the 1stBank Center in Broomfield.

DeGette also backed Clinton in 2008 over rival Barack Obama, who went onto win the nomination at the Democratic National Convention in Denver.
