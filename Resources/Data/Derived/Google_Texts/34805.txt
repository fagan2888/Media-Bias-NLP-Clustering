The Obama administration will hold a conference next month to showcase health insurers and business strategies that it has deemed "success stories" under the Affordable Care Act, Healthcare.gov CEO Kevin Counihan writes in a recent blog post.

At the forum on June 9, presenters will discuss strategies for consumer engagement, provider contracting and care coordination models tailored by population data. Insurers including Aetna, CareSource and Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield, among others, will describe new techniques that could help companies offer better healthcare coverage at a lower cost.

"We're excited to bring together national leaders within the marketplace to discuss innovative strategies for providing private health insurance coverage," Counihan writes. Post
