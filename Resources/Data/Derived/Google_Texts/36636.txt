Holiday train run brings smiles to kids in Mundelein

hello

Six-year-old Donovan Straka and 4-year-old Mason McMurray ran around the train tracks chasing the North Pole Central as it passed snow-covered towns and people bustling about in the holiday spirit Sunday as the North Central O Gaugers Model Railroad Club, Inc. held its winter holiday public train run at the Fremont Public Library in Mundelein.

Train fans enjoyed the annual event, which included Christmas-themed layouts.

"I love to do this," said model train operator Rip Patterson of Grayslake. "It's wonderful to see the faces of the kids as the trains go by and the whistles blow."

The club hosts a train run at the Fremont library on the second Saturday of each month from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. According to the group's website, its mission statement is to operate O-gauge trains, promote the hobby of model railroading and to enjoy the fellowship among railroaders.
