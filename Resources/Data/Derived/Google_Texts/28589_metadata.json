To mislead the public into believing lies to get ideological laws passed. Example: The President really Grubered us on that healthcare bill.\n\nRemember the Affordable Care Act? It\u2019s not so affordable anymore. The government is forcing us young people to pay an average of $2,000 a year for comprehensive health care we don\u2019t need at a time when we can barely find good jobs.\n\nMIT scholar and \u201cObamacare architect\u201d Jonathan Gruber infamously admitted the mandate passed because officials relied on \u201cthe stupidity of the American voter.\u201d Thus the term \u201cGrubered\u201d was born.\n\nNow it\u2019s happening again.\n\nPresident Obama is trying to Gruber us into this new \u201cfree\u201d community college plan. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.\n\nContrary to popular belief, the best things in life aren\u2019t free \u2013 and I\u2019m not talking about the occasional ice cream or hot dog. When the government is the entity offering free things, something sinister is at hand.\n\nObama\u2019s \u201cfree\u201d plan will actually cost taxpayers an estimated $60 billion\u201475 percent funded by the feds and 25 percent funded by opting-in states, over a 10-year period. The financial burden is just being shifted from college students to society as a whole. But we young people will ultimately be left with the tab.\n\nLuckily, Obama\u2019s free college plan may never pass\u2014and he knows it; yet another reason to assert your skepticism. This is one of several propositions the president has on his agenda, not to get passed, but to use as tools to demonize Republicans as 2016 approaches.\n\nThe biggest problem with our higher education system is the expensive cost, thanks to the unfettered plethora of government loans given to students, prompting greedy administrators to ratchet up tuition exponentially. Offering \u201cfree\u201d community college will just result in higher tuition.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, community college is already affordable. In my home state of Michigan, it\u2019s less than $100 per credit hour.\n\nEven with a four-year degree, it\u2019s not a given that graduates will be prepared for the workforce. A recent report by the Wall Street Journal pointed out that 40 percent of college students graduate without the reasoning skills to adequately work white-collar jobs. So why would we consider a free two-year degree as a solution to society\u2019s woes if a bachelor\u2019s degree isn\u2019t even preparing students for the workforce?\n\nObama\u2019s plan also snubs vital vocational colleges. His plan extends only to public community colleges and excludes technical schools. What a horrible caveat.\n\nIt\u2019s time for society to quit ushering every person into a four-year college education. Not everyone is meant for college\u2014and that\u2019s okay. Instead, society and the government should also urge those seeking a post-high school education to consider technical schools or other options that teach entrepreneurial skills, both areas where there are jobs.\n\nAs it stands, young people are going to school for four to six years to study topics such as women\u2019s studies and art history, subjects that don\u2019t exactly translate into jobs.\n\nLook, I went to a community college before transferring to the University of Michigan. I even recommended my sister go to community college. It\u2019s ideal for the student who doesn\u2019t quite know what they want to study yet or the student who has their eye on a two or four-year degree.\n\nBut this doesn\u2019t mean community college is a springboard to a prosperous society.\n\nSure, the program would help underprivileged families put their kids through college, but it also will give students who can get by a free ride on the taxpayer dime. Plus, there are already federal programs through FAFSA to help struggling students along the way.\n\nCommunity college, or any college, is not some deus ex machina to success, and Obama\u2019s plan is not some benevolent policy. Don\u2019t be Grubered, again.\n\nCollege Fix reporter Derek Draplin is a student at the University of Michigan, editor of the Michigan Review, and a Student Free Press Association Spring 2015 journalism fellow at the Detroit News.\n\nLike The College Fix on Facebook / Follow us on Twitter\n\nIMAGES: James Good/Flickr", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The College Fix", "description": "OPINION: From the Urban Dictionary - Grubered [Gr-oob-ered] Verb.
