You might be out of luck \u2014 FATCA\u2019s here \u2014 Koskinen gets the Times treatment\n\nGOT OBAMACARE TAX QUESTIONS? YOU MIGHT BE OUT OF LUCK. Big changes will be coming next filing season thanks to Obamacare \u2014 but IRS Commissioner John Koskinen warned yesterday that budget cuts will hurt the agency\u2019s ability to answer taxpayer questions about the new provisions. Koskinen, speaking at the IRS Nationwide Tax Forum in Chicago, said the level of phone service next year will drop to 53 percent if the agency doesn\u2019t receive proper funding.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t receive the funding and we can\u2019t do the hiring needed to handle this call volume, we estimate our level of phone service next year would plunge to 53 percent, which would be the lowest since 2008,\u201d Koskinen said, according to his prepared remarks. \u201cAt 53 percent, that would mean close to half of those trying to get our help over the phone would not get through.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIDENTITY THEFT, REFUND FRAUD SPURS DEPOSIT CHANGE. Another change on tap for next year will be new limits on the number of refunds that can be electronically deposited into a single account. \u201cStarting in January, direct deposit will be limited to three refunds into one account,\u201d Koskinen said. \u201cAny subsequent refund will automatically be converted to a paper check and mailed to the address on the tax return. \u2026 We\u2019ve also identified a number of tax preparers who abuse direct deposit to either serve as a banker for their clients or to take their fees from the refund. We\u2019ve identified about 4,400 personal accounts held by tax preparers where multiple refunds were deposited. We\u2019re putting a stop to that, too.\u201d\n\nFATCA\u2019S HERE. Our Rachael Bade reports, \u201cThe little-known Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, tucked into a jobs bill in 2010, requires every foreign bank, insurance company and other financial institutions with U.S. connections to play a new role in sniffing out American tax dodgers. It\u2019s even inspired other countries to try their hand at similar efforts. Backers call it a long-needed response to wealthy Americans stashing billions in income offshore. Opponents cry American imperialism. But both sides say it is historic.\u201d\n\n\u201cDespite the July 1 start date, detractors are still fighting. Banking groups have lost several lawsuits trying to change the law, but prominent conservative lawyer James Bopp Jr., a lawyer for Citizens United in its historic campaign finance win at the Supreme Court, is gearing up to challenge it in the coming months.\u201d Pros: http://politico.pro/1qvQS5i\n\nIT\u2019S WEDNESDAY!

The New York Times is out with a profile of the IRS commissioner: \u201cHired to rehabilitate an agency that went awry targeting political groups, Mr. Koskinen\u2019s style \u2014 quick-witted to the point of being flip and sometimes impolitic \u2014 has left some wondering if he is the right person to restore the I.R.S.\u2019s battered credibility. He was two years into retirement in May 2013, filling his days with tennis, theater and grandchildren, when he received a series of urgent telephone calls. The White House and Treasury Department wanted to know if the then 73-year-old with a history as a Washington fixer would be willing to come back to work for one last rescue mission.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter a moment of contemplation, Mr. Koskinen, who as a child dreamed of being president, agreed. The decision sent him into the center of the worst firestorm in the agency\u2019s recent history and made him Washington\u2019s most prominent punching bag. \u2018I think I need counseling,\u2019 Mr. Koskinen said, sitting at the head of the long wooden conference table in his beige and brown third-floor office at the I.R.S. headquarters. \u2018I\u2019m a recidivist, going from one kind of crisis to another.\u2019\u201d http://nyti.ms/1xeB0Vi\n\nOOF: HHS IG RELEASES OBAMACARE SUBSIDIES FINDINGS. POLITICOPro\u2019s Brett Norman reports that \u201cthe HHS Office of the Inspector General has found that the federal health insurance exchange failed to resolve 2.6 million of 2.9 million inconsistencies on Obamacare applications during the first three months of the initial open enrollment period. The inconsistencies, most relating to income and citizenship claims, don\u2019t necessarily mean that the information submitted was inaccurate or that the applicants received premium subsidies that they shouldn\u2019t have, but the new finding does suggest a sizeable blind spot in the review process.\u201d Here\u2019s the report: http://1.usa.gov/1rfaZoq\n\nOBAMA MOCKS CONGRESS ON HIGHWAY TRUST FUND. POLITICOPro\u2019s Kevin Robillard has the story: \u201c\u2018I haven\u2019t heard a good reason for why they haven\u2019t acted,\u2019 Obama said of the lawmakers in a speech in front of the Key Bridge, which connects Washington to Arlington, Virginia. \u2018It\u2019s not like they\u2019re busy with other stuff.\u2019\u201d http://politico.pro/1qOLgkq\n\nVAN HOLLEN, LEVIN: OUR BILL WILL \u2018SOLVE\u2019 HTF, INVERSIONS. Reps. Chris Van Hollen and Sander Levin have an op-ed out touting how the legislation they introduced last week \u2014 The Stop Corporate Expatriation and Invest in America\u2019s Infrastructure Act \u2014 will tackle corporate inversions and replenish the Highway Trust Fund. The Democrats say the bill \u201cwill put an end to tax-avoiding corporate expatriations and devote the resulting revenue to the Highway Trust Fund.\u201d http://vtd-tar.co/1z6jbd0\n\nNEW 501(c)(3) FORM CUTS DOWN THE PAPERWORK. The IRS yesterday introduced a new \u2014 and way shorter \u2014 application form for 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status. Instead of the whopping 26-page Form 1023, the new Form 1023-EZ is just three pages long. So what charitable orgs can use the always preferable less paperwork option? The agency says most small organizations are eligible to use the streamlined form, and that perhaps as many as 70 percent of all applicants, qualify. Most groups with gross receipts of $50,000 or less and assets of $250,000 or less are eligible, the IRS announced.\n\nThe release notes \u201cthe change will allow the IRS to speed the approval process for smaller groups and free up resources to review applications from larger, more complex organizations while reducing the application backlog. Currently, the IRS has more than 60,000 501(c)(3) applications in its backlog, with many of them pending for nine months.\u201d http://1.usa.gov/1qv9J0p\n\nSCOTUS AGREES TO HEAR TAX CASES NEXT TERM. The Supreme Court yesterday agreed \u201cto weigh a challenge to a Colorado law that requires out-of-state retailers to provide data on sales they make to customers in the state in an effort to encourage the payment of sales tax,\u201d Reuters reports. The court will also weigh \u201can appeal filed by the Alabama Department of Revenue in a case involving CSX Transportation Inc. The state is challenging a July 2013 ruling by the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which said a state tax on fuel purchased in the state is discriminatory because rail carriers like CSX have to pay it but companies that transport freight via water and road do not have to.\u201d http://reut.rs/1mFkJkn\n\nTREASURY ANNOUNCES LONGEVITY ANNUITIES FINAL RULES. Bloomberg reports, \u201cRetirees with 401(k) plans and individual retirement accounts will have more flexibility to purchase annuities that don\u2019t start paying out until age 80 or 85, under final rules from the U.S. Treasury Department. The rules announced today provide a new way for retirees to limit the drawdowns of their account balances that are now required starting after age 70 1/2. Instead, under the rules, they could use as much as 25 percent of their account balances up to $125,000 to purchase deferred annuities.\u201d http://buswk.co/1m6ETYD\n\nTRUE THE VOTE-IRS HEARING SET FOR NEXT FRIDAY. \u201cA federal judge scheduled a hearing for next week on a grass-roots conservative group's request to investigate missing emails at the Internal Revenue Service as part of the group's lawsuit against the agency,\u201d The Wall Street Journal reports. \u201cU.S. District Judge Reggie Walton ordered the hearing on Tuesday, after conservative group True the Vote filed a motion seeking to speed up discovery and \u2018preserve and prevent further destruction\u2019 of documents and electronic data. Among other things, the group wants a forensic expert to figure out how the emails were lost and examine whether any of the missing data can be recovered.\u201d http://on.wsj.com/TB31rd\n\nNORTH CAROLINA VOTERS NOT FANS OF MFA. WRAL reports, \u201cMost North Carolina voters oppose a federal bill that would allow online retailers to collect out-of-state sales tax, according to a poll released Tuesday by the National Taxpayers Union and the R Street Institute. The poll, based on a telephone survey of 400 North Carolinians likely to vote in the 2014 general election, showed that 70 percent of respondents oppose\u201d the Marketplace Fairness Act. http://bit.ly/V9zJRN\n\nQUICK LINKS:\n\n\u2014Bloomberg View\u2019s Megan McArdle: \u201cLois Lerner, Colonel Mustard and the Blue Screen of Death.\u201d http://bv.ms/1kb5FLj\n\n\u2014The Washington Post reports that D.C. prosecutors have dropped charges against the IRS employee who drove his car onto the White House grounds in May. http://wapo.st/1pTZX4j\n\n\u2014Howard Gleckman in Forbes: \u201cA Payroll Tax Math Error Adds $5 Billion To The Deficit.\u201d http://onforb.es/1xdvnXu\n\n\u2014CNNMoney reports, \u201cThink filing your tax return is a pain?
