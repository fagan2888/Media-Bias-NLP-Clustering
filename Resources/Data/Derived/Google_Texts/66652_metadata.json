But will it stay down for long?\n\nConservatives have had a rough start to the summer: Republican appointees on the Supreme Court helped enshrine same-sex marriage as a constitutional right and reaffirmed Obamacare as the law of the land. President Obama is coming off arguably the best week of his presidency, and his poll numbers are rising (although, to be fair, so are Donald Trump\u2019s). Yet without much notice, the far right did score a victory this week, when at midnight on Wednesday, the charter of the U.S. Export-Import Bank expired for the first time in its 81-year history. Little-known to most Americans outside Washington or the business community, the Export-Import Bank is a federal lending agency that helps U.S. firms connect with markets overseas. Its backers assert that the bank supports hundreds of thousands of American jobs. But for the last several years, the bank has become enmeshed in a proxy battle between Tea Party-aligned conservatives who want to kill the bank and establishment Republicans (and most Democrats) who have supported it for decades. Led by Representative Jeb Hensarling, a Texas conservative who chairs the House Financial Services Committee, critics of the bank say it exemplifies a kind of \u201ccrony capitalism\u201d in which government assistance goes disproportionately to large corporations like Boeing and General Electric that don\u2019t need federal help.\n\nThe conservative victory came as a result of Congress doing what it does best: Nothing. Despite an aggressive push from Democrats, the White House, and powerful industry groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, neither the House nor Senate held binding votes on its reauthorization as the deadline approached. Conservatives rejoiced. \u201cWe did it!\u201dexclaimed Heritage Action in a statement tweeted at midnight. BOOM. The Export-Import Bank is now EXPIRED. RT to spread the good news. http://t.co/ZJSO1d64Hk pic.twitter.com/goqjad5SJc \u2014 Heritage Action (@Heritage_Action) July 1, 2015 On the Ex-Im Bank\u2019s website, the homepage looks almost like a 404 message, featuring the words \u201cAUTHORITY HAS LAPSED\u201d in big capital letters. Despite the expired charter, the bank is not completely shuttered. While it cannot make any new loans, Congress already appropriated funds for it through the end of September, and it can continue to manage its preexisting loans, guarantees, and insurance policies. As The New York Times noted, the bank\u2019s doors were open Wednesday morning, and none of its 420 employees were furloughed. The economic implications pale in comparison to a debt default or a government shutdown. And both backers and opponents of the Export-Import Bank acknowledge that the fight over its future is far from over. That\u2019s especially true after the topsy-turvy congressional debate on trade in June, when legislation left for dead was revived\u2014and enacted\u2014barely a week later. Related Story The Messy Politics of Trade and the Export-Import Bank Hours before the midnight deadline, Obama convened a conference call of business leaders to reassure them he was \u201cconfident\u201d the bank would eventually be reauthorized. He urged them to speak out and contact members of Congress, and he pushed back against the argument from the right that the bank was a form of corporate welfare. \u201cThe notion that this somehow only benefits big companies is wrong,\u201d Obama said, according to The Hill. \u201cThis helps small- and medium-sized businesses \u2014 and by the way, big companies like Boeing or G.E. have a whole lot of small and medium-sized businesses who are suppliers of theirs.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The charter of the 81-year-old lending agency expired in a rare win for the right.
