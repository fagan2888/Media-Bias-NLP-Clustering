In response to decades of public advocacy, San Francisco transit authorities unanimously approved a $76 million plan to construct suicide barriers on the Golden Gate Bridge \u2014 where 46 people jumped to their death last year alone. \u201cThe time of healing can only begin when the drip-drip-drip of bodies into the raging waters has stopped,\u201d a mother of one jumper told Michael Cabanatuan of The San Francisco Chronicle.\n\n\u201cSuicide barriers on other bridges have proved to be successful in deterring jumpers,\u201d Mr. Cabanatuan wrote. \u201cAt the Ellington Street Bridge in Washington, D.C., suicides dropped from 25 in seven years to one in the five years after a barrier was erected. A span in Switzerland with a net saw suicides drop from 2.5 per year to none.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very emotional day, but it\u2019s very historic,\u201d said David Campos, a San Francisco transportation official, to Jennifer Chaussee of Reuters. \u201cIt\u2019s a unanimous vote for life today.\u201d\n\nIn Britain, lawmakers are considering the other side of the coin: If the government is obligated to protect the physically healthy from self-harm, does it have an obligation to assist the terminally ill to die with dignity? Is the right to life counterweighted by a right to die? According to Paul Lamb and Jane Nicklinson, the answer is a resolute yes.\n\nMr. Lamb, 57, \u201chas spent the past 23 years receiving round-the-clock care following a car crash which left him with only a tiny degree of movement in his right arm,\u201d reports Jonathan Brown for The Independent. Mrs. Nicklinson\u2019s husband, Tony, suffered from locked-in syndrome, entailing complete paralysis from the neck down following a stroke in 2005.\n\nThe pair originally went to Britain\u2019s Supreme Court in 2012. The goal: to secure the right to die with medical assistance for the severely disabled and \u201cto decide how to end this constant tortuous situation,\u201d which had become daily life, as described by Mr. Nicklinson in a 2012 statement from his attorneys. Current laws forbidding assisted death are \u201cbarbaric and inhumane,\u201d says Mr. Lamb.\n\nThe court rejected the plea, claiming that \u201cthe questions they raised were too significant to be decided upon in a court, and could only be answered by parliament,\u201d according to The Guardian\u2019s Alexandra Topping.\n\nMr. Nicklinson passed away six days after the ruling was handed down.\n\nMrs. Nicklinson and Mr. Lamb, however, were undeterred. They appealed the decision, and on June 24, nearly two years after the initial ruling, the court reaffirmed its stance 7 to 2 \u2014 though the verdict was accompanied by judicial comments that should prove heartening to those engaged in the effort to legalize and de-stigmatize assisted death.\n\nBrenda Hale, deputy president of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom and one of the dissenting justices, said \u201cthe problem was ensuring that \u2018vulnerable\u2019 people were not put under \u2018undue pressures\u2019 to end their lives,\u201d according to The Irish Times. She added that \u201cthat problem was not sufficient to justify a \u2018universal ban\u2019 on assisting suicide.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt now comes down to legislators to decide whether ailing Britons beyond the possibility of recovery do indeed have a right to die on their own terms. \u201cThe justices of the Supreme Court have given parliament what looks like a final warning,\u201d writes The Guardian\u2019s editorial board. \u201cIf they do not amend the 1961 Suicide Act, which makes it illegal to help someone to kill themselves, then by declaring the existing law incompatible with the Human Rights Act, the courts will force them to do so.\u201d\n\nIf members of Parliament vote with the general direction of public opinion in mind, it seems likely the efforts of Mrs. Nicklinson and Mr. Lamb will succeed. According to a poll by the Swiss Medical Lawyers Association, which surveyed Europeans in 12 countries on the permissibility of medically assisted suicide, an overwhelming 82 percent of Britons believe it should be decriminalized.\n\nThe objecting 18 percent is nevertheless vociferous. \u201cDisability isn\u2019t a punishment, and to consider it as such is an insult to every quadriplegic who has made something of his life,\u201d writes Kate Maltby for The Telegraph. \u201cJust because able-bodied people can and do commit suicide \u2014 always a terrible thing, always cataclysmic to the people around them \u2014 doesn\u2019t mean disabled people should.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause at the heart of this lies our chronic addiction to the language of rights,\u201d Ms. Maltby claims. \u201cWhen it comes to the fundamentals of birth, death, love, sex, the world has never been able to provide satisfactorily for us. How can we claim the right to a life without pain if none of us have ever known one? Is the government in breach of contract when it fails to stop my heart breaking?\u201d\n\nIt is a question popping up on legislative and judicial dockets around the world. Euthanasia (in which a doctor administers the lethal drug) is legal only in a handful of countries like the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg. Assisted suicide (in which the patient self-administers) is legal in Switzerland, Germany, Albania, Colombia, Japan and several American states (including Vermont, Montana, New Mexico, Oregon and Washington).\n\nCanada\u2019s Supreme Court is considering federal decriminalization of assisted suicide for the second time \u2014 though the province of Quebec has already implemented \u201ccomprehensive end-of-life legislation,\u201d according to The Globe and Mail. Prime Minister Stephen Harper\u2019s Conservative government, however, supports current laws, which categorically ban assisted death in any form. \u201cIt is our government\u2019s position that the Criminal Code provisions prohibiting assisted suicide and euthanasia are in place to protect all persons,\u201d said Justice Minister Peter MacKay.\n\nIn a column published in The Globe and Mail on Friday, the Canadian journalist Gary Mason reflected on his own struggle to understand, and ultimately embrace, the concept of assisted death. The last few years of his father\u2019s life were \u201cdreadful\u201d and \u201cwithout an ounce of joy\u201d for the family to endure, he recalls, but \u201cat the same time, I wasn\u2019t sure I could ever say \u2018yes\u2019 in a sibling vote to end his life, regardless of how humane it might be. Now, I realize how incredibly selfish that point of view was.\u201d\n\nMr. Mason lost his younger brother as well, to cancer, years later. As the younger Mason wasted away on a hospital bed, he \u201cimplored me to steal a needle somewhere and do the job myself,\u201d Mr. Mason jarringly recounts. \u201cThis was certainly not how I wanted to remember my brother. It was nothing close to the dignified end most of us hope for. In fact, his were precisely the circumstances that would qualify for physician-assisted death consideration in more enlightened jurisdictions around the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs Canada\u2019s baby boomers begin their grand exit,\u201d he writes, \u201cthe demand for a debate on this subject is only going to intensify.\u201d A demand that will undoubtedly reverberate around the world.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20140629113550, "BN": "op-talk", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/optalk", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/op-talk/post", "DISPLAYDATE": "June 29, 2014", "keywords": "Deeper Dive", "GBLC": "Deeper Dive", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/op-talk/Assisting in Life \u2014\u00a0and Death ( 20140629 )", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Jake Flanagin", "SCG": "op-talk", "sourceApp": "blogs", "CLMST": "Jake Flanagin", "byl": "Jake Flanagin", "twitter": {"description": "Patients\u2019 rights advocates are making swift strides toward the decriminalization of assisted death, writes JAKE FLANAGIN.
