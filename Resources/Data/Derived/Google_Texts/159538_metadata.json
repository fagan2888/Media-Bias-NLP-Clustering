At one point, Sanders rejected assertions by Clinton that a Sanders presidency could imperil President Barack Obama\u2019s signature legislative initiative, the Affordable Care Act.\n\nClinton said, \u201cThere are things we can do to improve (the Affordable Care Act), but to tear it up and start over again, pushing our country back into that kind of a contentious debate, I think is the wrong direction.\u201d\n\nSanders countered, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to tear up the Affordable Care Act. I helped write it.\u201d\n\nWe decided to check whether Sanders has a solid claim to have \u201chelped write\u201d the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAs our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker have noted, Sanders pushed hard for a more liberal version of health care reform -- the American Health Security Act of 2009, which would have implemented a national single-payer system. (Under a single-payer system, the government, rather than private health insurers, pays all medical bills, along the lines of Medicare.)\n\nSanders backed down after Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., used a procedural move to force a full reading of Sanders\u2019 bill, a move that would have taken hours of floor time and imperiled passage of a more moderate bill backed by Obama and his allies.\n\nHowever, as negotiations were in their final stage, Sanders successfully pushed for the inclusion of $11 billion in funding for community health centers, especially in rural areas. The insertion of this funding helped bring together both Democratic lawmakers on the left and Democrats representing more conservative, rural areas.\n\n\u201cThere was no one who played a more important role than Sen. Sanders\u201d in securing that funding, Daniel Hawkins, vice president of the National Association of Community Health Centers, told the Intercept last year.\n\nSo there\u2019s a good case to be made that Sanders made an important contribution to the final legislation.\n\nStill, when Sanders says he \u201chelped write\u201d the bill, it would be reasonable to imagine that Sanders was an integral player in the crafting of the bill over a long period of time -- an insider in the process. And that\u2019s not the reality.\n\nBefore the final bill was enacted, Sanders and his allies on the party\u2019s left flank regularly expressed frustration at the concessions they had to make during the legislative process.\n\n\u201cPublic-option proponents, including Sanders and Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, say they already have given up enough,\u201d Politico reported in late November 2009. \u201cThey agreed to forgo a single-payer system. They decided not to push a government plan tied to Medicare rates. And they accepted (Harry) Reid's proposal to include the opt-out provision. That's it, they say.\u201d\n\nPolitico went on to quote Sanders saying, \u201cI have made it clear to the administration and Democratic leadership that my vote for the final bill is by no means guaranteed.\"\n\nA few weeks later, Washington Post columnist Dana Milbank reported that Sanders was still undecided on supporting the primary Democratic bill. \"I am talking to the Democratic leadership, trying my best to salvage some positive things in this bill, so I am not on board yet.\"\n\nAnd on Dec. 18, the New York Times quoted Sanders saying, ''I don't sleep well. I am struggling with this issue very hard, trying to sort out what is positive in this bill, what is negative in the bill, what it means for our country if there is no health insurance legislation, when we will come back to it. \u2026 And I have to combine that with the fact that I absolutely know that the insurance companies and the drug companies will be laughing all the way to the bank the day after this is passed.''\n\nSanders eventually supported the legislation.\n\nOur ruling: Sanders said he \u201chelped write\u201d the Affordable Care Act. He deserves credit for one provision of it -- worth a not-insignificant $11 billion. But overall, he was hardly an inside crafter of the bill. Until his effort was blocked by a GOP procedural move, Sanders supported a more aggressive single-payer system, and multiple news articles quoted him as being undecided about supporting the main Democratic bill until late in the process.\n\nSanders\u2019 statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical", "article_metadata": {"isStory": "true", "isPremium": "false", "description": "Our partner, PolitiFact, fact checked four interesting claims during the Democratic presidential debate.", "og": {"site_name": "newsnet5", "description": "Our partner, PolitiFact, fact checked four interesting claims during the Democratic presidential debate.", "title": "Fact checking the fourth Democratic presidential candidate debate on Jan. 17", "url": "http://www.newsnet5.com/news/political/fact-checking-the-fourth-democratic-presidential-candidate-debate-on-jan-17", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://sharing.newsnet5.com/sharewfts/photo/2016/01/18/dems%20GettyImages-505439454_1453121404661_30128514_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "height": 480}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"app": {"id": {"ipad": 481449100, "iphone": 487296004}}, "site": "@wews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "shortHeadline": "FACT CHECK: The 4th Democratic debate", "com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages03.net,scripps.mkt7057.com,www.newsnet5.com,recp.mkt32.net", "hasVideo": "true", "fb": {"app_id": 117981068372285}, "idio": {"hasVideo": "true", "isPremium": "false"}, "keywords": "Political,News,Homepage Showcase,Tablet Showcase,Mobile Showcase,Newsletter Showcase", "google-site-verification": "DiabNvdHVXRDa2QCnoOOtjKaIvq8CtH1446fPeFerd0", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/WEWS5", "section": "Political", "published_time": "2016-01-18T14:56:36+0000", "modified_time": "2016-01-18T14:56:36+0000"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, target-densitydpi=device-dpi, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders sparred over health care policy during a debate in Charleston, S.C., on Jan. 17.\nI helped write it.\u201dWe decided to check whether Sanders has a solid claim to have \u201chelped write\u201d the Affordable Care Act.\nFACT CHECK #1: Bernie Sanders - \u201cI helped write\u201d the Affordable Care Act.\nFACT CHECK #4: Hillary Clinton - \"We now have driven (health care) costs down to the lowest they've been in 50 years.\"\nHere are the statements that we fact checked from Sunday night's debate:FACT CHECK #1: Bernie Sanders - \u201cI helped write\u201d the Affordable Care Act."}
