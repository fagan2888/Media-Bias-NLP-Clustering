Her request angered gay rights activists, but Bondi is no stranger to bad press \u2013 she\u2019s spent the past four years defending her stances on hot-button issues. With Bondi up for re-election next week, people may be asking: \u201cWho is she?\u201d\n\nBondi, 48, is Florida\u2019s first female attorney general. She was elected in 2010 after leaving her job as an assistant state attorney (prosecutor) and receiving the endorsement of former Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin. Cracking down on drug abuse and human trafficking have been among Bondi\u2019s missions, according to the \u201cMeet Pam\u201d page on her website. Since she took office, pill-related deaths have gone down in Florida and more than $11 million in assets related to criminal use of prescription drugs have been seized.\n\nBondi is perhaps best known for her opposition to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. Florida was one of the 26 states that sued President Barack Obama over the health care law, and in 2011, she wrote a strongly worded letter to the Wall Street Journal condemning the \"threat to individual liberty.\"\n\nBondi also opposes Florida\u2019s legalization of medical marijuana, which is on the ballot next week. In a 2013 brief, she wrote it was too lenient: \u201cWith no \u2018condition\u2019 off limits, physicians could authorize marijuana for anything, any time, to anyone, of any age.\u201d The fact-checking site PolitiFact rated her remarks mostly true.\n\nBondi often signs briefs about legal proceedings in other states, according to the Tampa Bay Times. For example, she opposed a ban on certain semiautomatic weapons in Connecticut after the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre. She is an active member of the Republican Attorneys General Association, which supports and raises funds for Republican candidates for the position.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nIn August, U.S. District Judge Robert L. Hinkle found that Florida\u2019s same-sex marriage ban was unconstitutional, but placed a stay on his decision until the U.S. Supreme Court resolved applications from other states on the subject. Bondi and Gov. Rick Scott appealed the case to federal court.\n\nThen earlier this month, the Supreme Court announced it would stop accepting appeals on same-sex marriages in those states -- Utah, Oklahoma and Virginia -- as well as Wisconsin and Indiana. In response, the American Civil Liberties Union asked Hinkle to lift the stay on Oct. 7. Bondi responded with her request on Friday.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://s2.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "pam bondi, attorney general, attorney general pam bondi, florida attorney general, florida attorney general pam bondi, attorney general gay marriage, same-sex marriage florida, florida gay marriage, florida same-sex marriage, florida pam bondi, pam bondi", "og": {"site_name": "International Business Times", "description": "Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi has a history of strong stances on hot-button issues.", "title": "Who is Pam Bondi?
