For example, 39.6% of respondents \u2014 except those who calculated that they will not trigger the tax \u2014 said they are working on changes, such as shifting costs by raising deductibles and coinsurance or moving to high-deductible consumer-driven health plans, to avoid the tax.\n\nIn addition, 40.3% of respondents said they plan to take action prior to 2018 to avoid the tax.\n\nOnly 4.9% of respondents said they will not make any plan changes to avoid the tax and will be hit by it.\n\n\u201cEmployers are already taking action because making the changes needed to avoid the tax can be time-consuming and challenging,\u201d Julie Stich, director of research at the Brookfield, Wisconsin-based IFEBP, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWith only 5% of employers reporting that they plan to pay the Cadillac tax, many Americans can expect to see changes to their employer-sponsored health plan,\u201d Ms. Stich added.\n\nWhether the tax will remain law, though, is not known. Earlier this week, the House Ways and Means Committee passed a repeal measure, which now will go before the House Budget Committee for inclusion in broader, still-developing budget bill.\n\nThe survey, conducted last month, is based on the responses of 422 human resources and benefit professionals.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Business Insurance", "description": "Nearly 60% of employers and other health plan sponsors say they will \u2014 unless they make changes \u2014 trigger the health care reform law excise tax on costly plans, according to a new survey.Under that Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act provision, which a growing number of lawmakers ...", "title": "Over half of employers could trigger health plan excise tax - Business Insurance", "url": "http://www.businessinsurance.com/article/20151001/NEWS03/151009983", "image": "http://www.businessinsurance.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CB/20151001/NEWS03/151009983/AR/0/health-care-reform-law-cadillac-tax.jpg", "type": "article"}, "image_src": "http://www.businessinsurance.com/assets/rwd/bi-logo-footer.png", "description": "Nearly 60% of employers and other health plan sponsors say they will \u2014 unless they make changes \u2014 trigger the health care reform law excise tax on costly plans, according to a new survey.Under that Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act provision, which a growing number of lawmakers ...", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui", "title": "Over half of employers could trigger health plan excise tax - Business Insurance"}, "article_summary": "Nearly 60% of employers and other health plan sponsors say they will \u2014 unless they make changes \u2014 trigger the health care reform law excise tax on costly plans, according to a new survey.\n\u201cWith only 5% of employers reporting that they plan to pay the Cadillac tax, many Americans can expect to see changes to their employer-sponsored health plan,\u201d Ms. Stich added.\nA whopping 77.3% of public-sector employers said they have done the calculations and will trigger the tax if they don't make any plan changes, while 63.5% of private-sector employers said they will trigger the tax, as will 36.9% of multiemployer plans.\nOnly 4.9% of respondents said they will not make any plan changes to avoid the tax and will be hit by it.\nIn addition, 40.3% of respondents said they plan to take action prior to 2018 to avoid the tax."}
