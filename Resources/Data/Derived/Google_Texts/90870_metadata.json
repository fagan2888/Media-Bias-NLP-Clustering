Or technically, 75,600 minutes, according to a new state law.\n\nBut what if that instruction time was even longer? Some experts believe that will translate into better academic results.\n\n\u201cWhen we see kids growing up in poverty who are successful academically, it\u2019s because they\u2019ve spent more academic time on task,\u201d said Bob Sanborn, president and CEO of Children at Risk, which recently held a forum on the topic.\n\n\u201cTheir school has figured out a way, their parents have figured out a way, they\u2019re in high quality after-school.\u201d\n\nIn fact, extended learning time can take various forms:\n\nA longer school day that matches the parent\u2019s work day.\n\nA longer school year, such as Saturday school or a shorter summer vacation.\n\nQuality after-school time, provided by outside agencies.\n\nSome charter school networks here in Houston, such as KIPP and YES Prep, have extended class time in their academic models.\n\nHowever, the reform strategy has shown mixed results in other places like Boston. There a longer day failed to dramatically boost academic achievement or did so only temporarily.\n\nStill advocates, like Sanborn, say certain students need extra time to catch up.\n\n\u201cChildren growing up in low-income households, which represent 60 percent of Texas families, when we look at those kids, they need more time on task,\u201d Sanborn said.\n\nIt\u2019s something that Texas lawmakers have contemplated. Two years ago, they created a council to study the issue.\n\nIt recommended funding new grants to expand learning time in 2016-17 and also more resources and training.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Education News", "description": "Some charter school networks here in Houston, such as KIPP and YES Prep, have extended class time in their academic models.", "programs": "none", "og": {"site_name": "Houston Public Media", "description": "Some charter school networks here in Houston, such as KIPP and YES Prep, have extended class time in their academic models.", "title": "Does More Time In Class Equal More Learning? | Houston Public Media", "url": "https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/2015/11/27/128746/does-more-time-in-class-equal-more-learning/", "image": {"secure_url": "https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/06221000/desks-band-white-free-images400px-310px-tn.png", "url": "https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/06221000/desks-band-white-free-images400px-310px-tn.png", "height": 233, "width": 300, "identifier": "https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/06221000/desks-band-white-free-images400px-310px-tn.png", "type": "image/png"}, "type": "article"}, "wordCount": 263, "twitter": {"description": "Some charter school networks here in Houston, such as KIPP and YES Prep, have extended class time in their academic models.", "title": "Does More Time In Class Equal More Learning?", "url": "https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/2015/11/27/128746/does-more-time-in-class-equal-more-learning/", "image": "https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/06221000/desks-band-white-free-images400px-310px-tn.png", "creator": "@houstonpubmedia", "site": "@houstonpubmedia", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Laura Isensee", "org_id": 220, "datePublished": "2015-11-27T06:00:11+00:00", "fb": {"admins": 37511993, "app_id": 1520489194943572, "pages": 27589213702}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "article": {"section": "News", "tag": "yes prep", "published_time": "2015-11-27T06:00:11+00:00"}, "keywords": "Education News, News, charter schools, children at risk, education, extended learning time, kipp, school reform, yes prep", "google-site-verification": "QOrBnMZ1LXDA9tL3e5WmFUU-oI3JUbDRotOWST1P_Dg", "has_audio": 1, "bitly-verification": "7777946f1a0a"}, "article_summary": "Some charter school networks here in Houston, such as KIPP and YES Prep, have extended class time in their academic models.\nA longer school year, such as Saturday school or a shorter summer vacation.\n\u201cChildren growing up in low-income households, which represent 60 percent of Texas families, when we look at those kids, they need more time on task,\u201d Sanborn said.\nIt recommended funding new grants to expand learning time in 2016-17 and also more resources and training.\n\u201cTheir school has figured out a way, their parents have figured out a way, they\u2019re in high quality after-school.\u201dIn fact, extended learning time can take various forms:A longer school day that matches the parent\u2019s work day."}
