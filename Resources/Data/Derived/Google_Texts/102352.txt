Updated on Jan. 8 at 7:22 p.m.: Dallas Police on Wednesday said that a man found dead by the side of the Dallas North Tollway on Sunday afternoon had jumped from the George Bush Turnpike.

The Collin County Medical Examiner’s Office identified the man as 36-year-old Charles Casstevens. The office ruled his death a suicide.

Casstevens was the assistant band director at Garland High School.

Garland ISD spokesman Chris Moore said additional grief counselors have been made available to students and teachers.

“With Mr. Casstevens’ primary role focusing on the GHS band, we focused effort to those kids. By nature, extra curricular activities result in extra time being spent teaching and learning,” Moore said. “He impacted the lives of hundreds during his time at Garland High School. We want to be there for them.”
