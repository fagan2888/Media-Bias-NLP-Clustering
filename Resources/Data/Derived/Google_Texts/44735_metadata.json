He is trying to get his life back together but he\u2019s still afraid that the government will try to restart his addiction again.\u201d Romero allegedly fell back into his bad habits when federal officers handed him crack cocaine for his help with informants in the case, though he\u2019s now drug-free. Elizabeth Martinez, spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Albuquerque, said that the office declined to comment.\n\n\u201cThe United States government and the defendants affirmatively and intentionally established a pattern of distribution of crack cocaine to [Romero] in order to utilize his addiction to crack cocaine to further the investigation and to \u2018stack drug related charges\u2019 against him,\u201d the lawsuit reads. Five DEA agents were named in the lawsuit, including two special agents, one group supervisor, the overall agent in charge, and an assistant agent-in-charge.\n\nThe lawsuit also states that Romero was a victim of recklessness on behalf of the DEA agents. Romero seeks $8.5 million in damages, for the loss of \u201clove, familial relationships, and companionship\u201d due to the re-ignition of his drug addiction.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "crack cocaine, operation smack city, aaron romero", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Aaron Romero filed a lawsuit against DEA agents in Las Vegas after they paid the former drug addict in crack cocaine to assist in an undercover drug bust.", "title": "DEA Agents Paid Drug Addict In Crack For His Help In Investigation", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/dea-agents-sued-paying-drug-addict-crack-cocaine-aaron-romero-blames-government-re-instilling-his", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/16/crack.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Aaron Romero filed a lawsuit against DEA agents in Las Vegas after they paid the former drug addict in crack cocaine to assist in an undercover drug bust.", "title": "DEA Agents Paid Drug Addict In Crack For His Help In Investigation", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/dea-agents-sued-paying-drug-addict-crack-cocaine-aaron-romero-blames-government-re-instilling-his", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/16/crack.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/16/crack.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Drugs", "published_time": "2014-07-16T17:51:13-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-16T18:00:16-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Aaron Romero filed a lawsuit against DEA agents in Las Vegas after they paid the former drug addict in crack cocaine to assist in an undercover drug bust."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf6cd\"", "article_summary": "Romero seeks $8.5 million in damages, for the loss of \u201clove, familial relationships, and companionship\u201d due to the re-ignition of his drug addiction.\nA former drug addict is suing federal agents after they paid him in crack cocaine for his help during an undercover investigation in Las Vegas, New Mexico.\nFive DEA agents were named in the lawsuit, including two special agents, one group supervisor, the overall agent in charge, and an assistant agent-in-charge.\nThe lawsuit also states that Romero was a victim of recklessness on behalf of the DEA agents.\n38-year-old Aaron Romero was approached by Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) officers back in 2011, in order to assist in a drug bust referred to as \u201cOperation Smack City.\u201d The DEA agents paid Romero with portions of the drugs they confiscated, allegedly reigniting his crack addiction."}
