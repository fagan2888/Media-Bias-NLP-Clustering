How well do you know Sen. Rand Paul?

A lot of his critics think he’s ready to dismantle the federal government until there’s virtually nothing left.

But in an interview at his home in Bowling Green, Ky., back in the spring of 2013, he says that’s simply not true.

“It’s not that I believe in no government, Paul, R-Ky., told The Daily Signal. “I just believe we should have the amount of government that we bring in in taxes, spend what comes in. That’s an enormous amount of government, $2.6 trillion (the amount at the time of the interview in 2013). The problem is we spend $3.8 trillion and we only bring in $2.6 trillion. $2.6 trillion is a lot of money; you could do a lot of things. It wouldn’t be no government but we would have to get rid of some of the wasteful parts of government.”

Paul is trying to position himself as a different kind of Republican, and when asked what he wants people to know about him, his answer was vintage Rand Paul.

“I consider myself to be a family man and a good husband. I mow my own grass, I compost because I care about the environment…I truly care about trying to make the country a better place for everybody, to try and have such prosperity that I can come home from Washington and go back to being a doctor.”
