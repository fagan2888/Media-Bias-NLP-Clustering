MADRID (AP) â€” Spain's film academy has selected for the first time a Basque-language movie titled "Loreak" (Flowers) as its entry for best foreign language film at next year's Oscars.

The film, chosen Tuesday, tells the story of a woman whose life undergoes change on receiving flowers at the same time every week from an anonymous person.

Basque is spoken in Spain's northern Basque region, famous for its cuisine and cities such as Bilbao and San Sebastian.

The film was directed by Jose Mari Goenaga and Jon Garano.

The U.S. film academy will select finalists for the Oscars in January, with the awards announced a month later.

Spain has won four Oscars for best foreign language film.
