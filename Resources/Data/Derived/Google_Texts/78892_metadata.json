Greg Abbott drew a crowd Monday morning.\n\nThe governor was in Abilene to sign copies of his book, \"Broken but Unbowed.\" He launched a Texas signing tour last Wednesday in Austin and has drawn a line of fans at every stop. More than 100 showed up here.\n\nAre taxpayers funding this tour? No, we were told. The governor is not making a dime off the book, with advance sales paying for the tour and proceeds going to Finally Home, a nonprofit that, according to its website, provides a \"unique network of experienced builders, suppliers, and supporters dedicated to building homes for wounded, ill or injured veterans, surviving spouses and their families.\"\n\nThe governor took time to greet those who came to see him. It should be this way, anyway. A governor should interact with the people. He told us their concerns include a secure border, the economy and roads.\n\nGov. Abbott is personable, fully at ease talking to an Air Force veteran, a woman cradling a photograph of her son in a wheelchair and the tween, wearing her martial arts uniform, there with her mother.\n\nOf course, he is a politician and when asked during a short meeting with the media if he supported Donald Trump, Gove. Abbott quickly went on the offensive against likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. He linked her to lax dealings with terrorists, said our borders would be \"even more open\" if she were elected and predicted she would turn Obamacare into Clintoncare.\n\nSeveral in the line openly carried. One veteran wore a T-shirt imprinted with \"Free men do not ask permission to bear arms.\"\n\nGov. Abbott on Monday, however, was just as happy to see them bear copies of his book.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Our opinion: A governor should interact with the people, and Abbott is champ at this", "og": {"url": "http://www.reporternews.com/opinion/editorials/our-opinion-a-governor-should-interact-with-the-people-and-abbott-is-champ-at-this-33a05733-c6c2-762-380736691.html", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-arn-icon-200.png", "height": 200}, "type": "article", "description": "Governor takes time to meet fans during book-signing event Monday at Hasings.", "title": "Our opinion: A governor should interact with the people, and Abbott is champ at this"}, "twitter": {"site": "@reporternews", "image": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-arn-icon-200.png", "description": "Governor takes time to meet fans during book-signing event Monday at Hasings.", "card": "summary", "title": "Our opinion: A governor should interact with the people, and Abbott is champ at this"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-arn-icon-144.png", "__sync_contentCategory": "premium", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Abbott on Monday, however, was just as happy to see them bear copies of his book.\nThe governor was in Abilene to sign copies of his book, \"Broken but Unbowed.\"\nHe launched a Texas signing tour last Wednesday in Austin and has drawn a line of fans at every stop.\nA governor should interact with the people.\nThe governor took time to greet those who came to see him."}
