Drink hot chocolate. Talk about getting health insurance.\"\n\nIt was also parodied by critics of Obamacare.\n\nOkay\u2026 RT @GaltsGirl: I'd pay someone to photoshop @PressSec and #pajamaboy\u2026 pic.twitter.com/IdHXer87nz - Matt (@Matthops82) December 18, 2013\n\nVideo ad campaigns across the country are also underway: Paul Bunyan on water skis makes the pitch in Minnesota; in Oregon, a guitar-strumming hipster sells Obamacare with a catchy tune; frat boys doing keg stands try to capture attention in Colorado; and then, a dancing Obama impersonator spoofs Snoop to tell kids, Sign up 'cause it's hot.\"\n\n\"Seventy percent of people who saw our ad talked to somebody in the last month,\" said Richard Onizuka, director of the Washington Health Benefit Exchange, which has also been trying to drum up awareness among young people with catchy insurance marketing.\n\nInsurance companies say they are joining the effort with a major media push through the end of the year. WellPoint reportedly plans to spend $100 million in the next two weeks on an ad campaign to woo the young.\n\nMeanwhile, anti-Obamacare crusaders are trying to get some young people to resist. One group, funded by the conservative Koch Brothers, launched this creepy video with Uncle Sam taking over a woman's medical exam. It has over two million views.\n\nHealth industry experts say the stakes are high: If fewer than 40 percent of all enrollees for 2014 are young adults ages 18-34, then future premiums could skyrocket.\n\nSo far, states have a long way to go to hit that target.\n\nOf the nine states that have released demographic data on their enrollees, none have reached the magic mark of 40 percent. In California, for example, only 22 percent of sign-ups have been young adults. Kentucky says 20 percent of its sign-ups are 18-34, while Colorado has reported just 17 percent. The White House has declined to release age data for sign-ups at HealthCare.gov.\n\nHow much higher could premiums go?\n\nIf young adults make up just 25 percent of sign-ups in a given state, for example, insurers would have to raise premiums by at least 2.4 percent next year, according to projections by the Kaiser Family Foundation. That would mean a family of four making more than $94,200 a year would see premiums rise $223. A 27-year-old making $25,000 would see a $42-a-year increase.\n\nIndustry and administration officials stress that it is still early in the process, and that young people still have more than three months to sign up. They also say the expectation has always been that young, healthy people will enroll late in the process, as was the case in Massachusetts.\n\n\"We are all still in the first inning of a nine-inning game,\" said Peter Lee, executive director of Covered California.\n\nThe enrollment period closes on March 31, 2014.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Obamacare Hipster in PJs Lures Young, Healthy", "description": "Obamacare Hipster in PJs Lures Young, Healthy", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 ABC News Internet Ventures", "author": "ABC News", "og": {"url": "http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2013/12/obamacare-hipster-in-pjs-lures-young-healthy/", "site_name": "ABC News", "description": "Obamacare's allies launched a media blitz to get young people to sign up.", "title": "Obamacare Hipster in PJs Lures Young, Healthy"}, "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"admins": 704409894, "app_id": 4942312939}, "keywords": "politics news, election news, political news, political news articles", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd62b\"", "article_summary": "(@BarackObama/Twitter | @Matthops82/Twitter)Five days before the first major Obamacare enrollment deadline, it's an all-out battle to attract the young and healthy.\nIn California, for example, only 22 percent of sign-ups have been young adults.\nThey also say the expectation has always been that young, healthy people will enroll late in the process, as was the case in Massachusetts.\nWellPoint reportedly plans to spend $100 million in the next two weeks on an ad campaign to woo the young.\nHealth industry experts say the stakes are high: If fewer than 40 percent of all enrollees for 2014 are young adults ages 18-34, then future premiums could skyrocket."}
