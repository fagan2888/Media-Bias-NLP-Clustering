But unlike most cases of missing money in Afghanistan (of which there are plenty), the auditors don\u2019t blame this on corruption or waste\u2014but rather on accounting issues.\n\nThe Commander\u2019s Emergency Response Program, for example, is set up in such a way that it\u2019s extremely difficult to monitor all of the money spent on the program\u2019s projects. Under that program, commanders may spend money to respond to emergencies like floods and fires. Any expense below $500,000 isn\u2019t treated as a traditional defense contract and doesn\u2019t have to be recorded in the same way.\n\nThe Pentagon only had data for about 57 percent of the total $795 million spent by that program between the years 2002 and 2013.\n\nRelated: 7 Threats to U.S. Rebuilding Efforts in Afghanistan\n\nThe report blamed the Pentagon\u2019s earlier (and since discontinued) process for tracking contracts. Today, when DOD awards a contract, it enters the contract into the Federal Procurement Database along with the specific pool of money that will be used to pay the contract.\n\n\n\nBefore 2010, however, the Pentagon wasn\u2019t required to identify the pool of money the contracts were being paid from when it came to foreign military equipment and arming the Afghan National Security Forces. No wonder those transactions were and are nearly impossible to track.\n\n\n\nOut of the total amount DOD has spent in Afghanistan, more than $57 billion has gone to the Afghan Forces \u2013 but the Pentagon can only account for about $17 billion.\n\n\n\nUnlike in most of SIGAR\u2019s reports, Sopko did not include any recommendations in this audit. \u201cSIGAR is presenting this data here to inform Congress and the U.S. taxpayer how their reconstruction dollars are being spent in Afghanistan,\u201d Sopko said.\n\nRelated: Agencies Don\u2019t Know Which Women\u2019s Programs Get Millions in Afghanistan\n\nThis is only the latest example of missing taxpayer money in Afghanistan. SIGAR routinely cranks out eyebrow-raising reports flagging serious waste, fraud or abuse that has plagued the 13-year reconstruction effort.\n\nEarly this year, the watchdogs released a scathing report revealing the Pentagon had no way to verify whether the annual $300 million going to the Afghan Police Force was ending up in the right hands. In another example, SIGAR noted U.S. agencies couldn\u2019t identify all the various projects, programs and initiatives supporting Afghan women. They don\u2019t how much they\u2019ve spent on the individual efforts, which together have cost at least $64 million.\n\nSopko has intensified his scrutiny of the U.S.\u2019s rebuilding mission in Afghanistan\u2014raising questions about whether we\u2019re any closer to achieving a stable and sustainable country hundreds of billions of dollar (and tens of thousands of lives) later. Overall, the U.S. has poured more than $104 billion into Afghanistan since 2002.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Hundreds of millions of dollars are missing in action in Afghanistan, and auditors are", "title": "$45 Billion in Tax Dollars Goes Missing in Afghanistan", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/01/45-Billion-Tax-Dollars-Goes-Missing-Afghanistan", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/05012014_Afghanistan_Poppy.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/01/45-Billion-Tax-Dollars-Goes-Missing-Afghanistan", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/05012014_Afghanistan_Poppy.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@Briannaehley"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Hundreds of millions of dollars are missing in action in Afghanistan, and auditors are", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Related: $100 Billion in Aid Squandered in AfghanistanThe auditors said DOD handed over data only for $21 billion of the total $66 billion it spent rebuilding the war-torn country.\n\u201cSIGAR is presenting this data here to inform Congress and the U.S. taxpayer how their reconstruction dollars are being spent in Afghanistan,\u201d Sopko said.\nHundreds of millions of dollars are missing in action in Afghanistan, and auditors are blaming the Pentagon\u2019s flawed accounting practices for the problem.\nRelated: Agencies Don\u2019t Know Which Women\u2019s Programs Get Millions in AfghanistanThis is only the latest example of missing taxpayer money in Afghanistan.\nBut unlike most cases of missing money in Afghanistan (of which there are plenty), the auditors don\u2019t blame this on corruption or waste\u2014but rather on accounting issues."}
