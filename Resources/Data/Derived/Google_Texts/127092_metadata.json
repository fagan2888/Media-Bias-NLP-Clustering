Together, their responses illustrate the diversity of the indigenous communities of the Western Hemisphere, as well as their shared concerns, and offer insights beyond what\u2019s in the news to the ideas and experiences of Native peoples today.\n\nPlease introduce yourself with your name and title.\n\nAkwe, my name is Daniel S. Collins Sr., and I am the chairman of the Shinnecock Indian Nation Council of Trustees.\n\nCan you share with us your Shinnecock name?\n\nMy mother gave me the name Eagle Feather after birth.\n\nWhere is your community located?\n\nThe Shinnecock Indian Reservation is adjacent to the town of Southampton, on Long Island in New York.\n\nWhere are the Shinnecock people originally from?\n\nThe Shinnecock are referred to as the People of the Stony Shores. I believe that the air, land, and sea represent all that our bodies are made of. The air gives life, the land is a solid and forms the body, and water is the cycling process that sustains the body. All of these elements come together along the shore.\n\nIn a vision I had back sometime, I saw the waves rolling in onto the stony shores of Shinnecock. Each time the waves would break and begin to roll back out, a man and woman would evolve from the waves onto the shore. When the waves stopped, the shores were outlined as far as the eye could see east to west with beautiful brown-skinned human beings, known today as the Shinnecock, the People of the Stony Shores. Our people were put here by the Creator and have lived and survived here since time immemorial.\n\nWhat is a significant point in history from your tribe that you would like to share?\n\nFirst contact with early settlers sailing in to Conscious Point in 1640. The loss of ten Shinnecock men in the shipwreck of the Circassian in 1876. Most recently, I would have to say, our receiving federal recognition as the 565th Indian Nation, on October 1, 2010. These are just a few historical points, which outline how we have been here and our current-day status.\n\nHow is your tribal government set up?\n\nPrior to December 2013, the government structure of the Shinnecock Nation consisted of a three-man Board of Trustees. The chairman was decided based upon who received the most votes. In December of 2013, we enacted the ratified Constitution of the Nation and a new Council of Trustees was elected consisting of seven council members: chairman, vice chairman, treasurer, council secretary, General Council secretary, sachem (male elder), and sunksqua (female elder). The new Council of Trustees afforded the Shinnecock Nation the opportunity to elect two female councilors to serve for the first time in Shinnecock history.\n\nIs there a functional, traditional entity of leadership in addition to your modern government system?\n\nThe sachem and sunksqua are members of the Council of Elders and provide spiritual guidance and act as peacekeepers.\n\nHow often are elected leaders chosen?\n\nThe last election was held in December. Until then, since 1792 the Shinnecock Nation held trustees elections every April on the first Tuesday. We are currently proposing staggered terms to ensure forward progress of the nation\u2019s business endeavors with the newly elected and remaining trustees each year.\n\nHow often does your tribal council meet?\n\nThe Council of Trustees meets weekly. There is also a monthly meeting between the Council of Trustees and the General Council, which consist of all the enrolled community members. This is done to ensure community involvement and transparency.\n\nTo read the full interview, visit the NMAI series here.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The National Museum of the American Indian interview series Meet Native America continues today with Daniel S.
