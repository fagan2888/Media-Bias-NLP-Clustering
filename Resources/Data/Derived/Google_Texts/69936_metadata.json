It describes a young University of Michigan graduate\u2019s experience that there is nothing \u201caffordable\u201d about the Affordable Care Act. She concludes that it has done little but rape her future.\n\nAshley Dionne, 26, posted her letter on conservative talk radio host Dennis Prager\u2019s Facebook page, and it\u2019s now being picked up by other media.\n\nAlthough highly educated at a well-respected university, Dionne describes herself as a member of the \u201cworking poor.\u201d She\u2019s paid $8 an hour to work 32 hours a week at a gym. She was placed in that position by a failing economy, which Obamacare can only make worse.\n\nObamacare is forcing her out of a plan she favors and into one in which the premiums have more than quadrupled and with a massive deductible. Yet her own medical problems mean that going uninsured is not an option.\n\nHere\u2019s her letter:\n\nMy name is Ashley Dionne and I\u2019m a 26-year-old recent graduate from Michigan. The phony Obamacare signup poster boy made me want to send a message about how Obamacare is really affecting people. I graduated from The University of Michigan in 2009. In my state, this used to mean something, but even with a bachelor\u2019s I was told I was too educated and wouldn\u2019t stay. I watched as kids with GEDs and high school diploma\u2019s took the low-paying jobs for which I applied. I went back to school and got a second degree and finally found work at a gym. I work nights and only get 32 hours a week for eight dollars an hour. I\u2019m unable to find a second job at this time. I have asthma, ulcers, and mild cerebral palsy. Obamacare takes my monthly rate from $75 a month for full coverage on my \u201cYoung Adult Plan,\u201d to $319 a month. After $6,000 in deductibles, of course. Liberals claimed this law would help the poor. I am the poor, the working poor, and I can\u2019t afford to support myself, let alone older generations and people not willing to work at all. This law has raped my future. It will keep me and kids my age from having a future at all. This is the real face of Obamacare and it isn\u2019t pretty.\n\nLiberals have yet to learn \u2014 there is no such thing as a free lunch.\n\n[poll id=\u201d123\u2033]", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "A heartbreaking, open letter, posted on Facebook, is going viral.
