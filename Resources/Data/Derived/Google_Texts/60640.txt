A local reporter not ready for the big leagues is backtracking from claims the White House prescreens media questions.

Catherine Anaya, from Phoenix’s KPHO-TV, says she was mistaken for saying members of the White House Press Corps submit questions to press secretary Jay Carney before the daily televised press briefing.

She shared her "off the cuff and unscripted" observation Wednesday night during a segment on the CBS affiliate about her day at the White House. Anaya was one of six local reporters invited to discuss the minimum wage and Obamacare with the President for a four minute interview.

Her suggestion raised the alarm that the Obama White House, already under fire for keeping the press at bay, was censoring press inquiries.

Carney insisted her statement was false and at least one former White House correspondent for ABC News, Jake Tapper, now at CNN, agreed that Anaya had the facts wrong and called the suggestion “nonsense.”

Baffled that “much had been inferred” by her comment, Anaya said on Thursday that she misunderstood the protocol followed by reporters assigned to the White House since she submitted her questions to the White House before she interviewed President Obama on Wednesday.

She clarified that she wasn’t asked to submit her questions but did so as a courtesy.

"I took a conversation about the preparation for a press briefing and muddied it with my own experience of wanting to provide a question for the press briefing. I incorrectly applied the process to everyone. That was wrong and it was bad reporting," she said in a statement.
