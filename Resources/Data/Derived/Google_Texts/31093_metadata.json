The MNsure website had more than 100,000 visitors on opening day, and more than 500 people created accounts in just the first hour of operation.\n\n\u201cWe are very happy and pleased to be open this afternoon,\u201d said April Todd-Malmlov, MNsure\u2019s executive director. \u201cWe have had great interest today.\u201d\n\nBut the rollout of the health insurance marketplace, where 1.3 million individuals are eventually expected to obtain coverage, left largely unanswered many questions about how well the system will function. That\u2019s in part because the website where people can shop for coverage didn\u2019t go live until after 3 p.m. on Tuesday.\n\nAs anticipated, there were some glitches on startup. At least one key feature of the site \u2013 the ability to look up whether a specific medical provider is p\n\nart of the network for an insurance plan \u2013 was not working. In addition, the site initially will not be available from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. each day in order to allow for ongoing maintenance. There were also problems with account creation owing to server problems.\n\nIn addition, Native Americans were advised to wait a week before seeking coverage through the state-run exchange, because the computer system was having problems calculating the correct subsidies available for those individuals. MNsure officials indicated that they\u2019ve identified the problems and expect to have them fixed within a week.\n\nFurther complicating the rollout, MNsure officials said they would not begin certifying roughly 5,000 individuals \u2013 insurance brokers, nonprofit employees, government workers \u2013 who will help people obtain coverage until Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWe know there\u2019s been a few bumps in the road both for us and for the federal government as well, but we are tracking those, addressing them and fixing them as they come up,\u201d said Todd-Malmlov.\n\nOfficials encouraged\n\nDespite the first day turbulence, proponents of the health insurance exchange expressed satisfaction with MNsure\u2019s much-anticipated debut. In particular, they stressed that Minnesota\u2019s exchange will offer the lowest rates in the country for many groups of individuals.\n\n\u201cSo far, so good,\u201d said Rep. Joe Atkins, DFL-Inver Grove Heights, the lead author of exchange legislation in the House. \u201cI\u2019m cautious by nature, but optimistic that it\u2019s going to turn out fine. Obviously it\u2019s a long day and a long week and we\u2019ll see how it all shakes out.\u201d\n\nSen. Tony Lourey, DFL-Kerrick, the lead author of exchange legislation in the Senate, pointed out that plans purchased through MNsure won\u2019t become active until January 1, so there\u2019s plenty of time to work out any kinks. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be a lot of people closing the deal in these first few days,\u201d Lourey said. \u201cIt\u2019s more kicking the tires.\u201d\n\nBut skeptics of the viability of a state-run marketplace expressed concern that it was rolled out prematurely in order to meet an arbitrary deadline set by the federal government. Specifically, they stressed concerns about data security given an earlier breach in which personal information concerning more than 1,500 insurance brokers was inadvertently released.\n\n\u201cI think they were under tremendous pressure to comply with the law instead of doing good project management,\u201d said Sen. Michelle Benson, R-Ham Lake, the ranking minority member of the Health, Human Services and Housing Committee. \u201cWe\u2019re going to keep finding stumbles and missteps. I don\u2019t think they did good testing on this.\u201d\n\nNo rush to acquire coverage\n\nThe Anoka County Human Services Center, in Blaine, has set up a room on the fourth floor where individuals seeking coverage through MNsure can learn about their options in the fledgling marketplace. The county is sharing the space with the Anoka County Community Action Program (ACCAP). County workers will enroll individuals who qualify for public plans (i.e. Medicaid and MinnesotaCare), while those who need to purchase private coverage will be assisted by ACCAP employees.\n\nAccording to Jerry Vitzthum, Anoka County\u2019s director of economic assistance, they\u2019ve added 17 workers to handle the expected influx of people seeking coverage. But at 1p.m. on opening day, with the enrollment system not yet functional, no one was seeking insurance.\n\n\u201cIf the thing works as it\u2019s eventually supposed to, it could make our lives a lot easier,\u201d Vitzthum said. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t work that way, then it could make more work for us. That\u2019s the only concern we have.\u201d\n\nAt Portico Healthnet, a nonprofit group in St. Paul that helps people acquire health insurance, the first day was similarly quiet. The group expects to eventually have 15 workers certified to sign people up for coverage through MNsure, but that process won\u2019t begin until Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re finished with training,\u201d said Rebecca Lozano, Portico\u2019s outreach manager. \u201cWe are ready to hit the ground running as soon as we get the go ahead from MNsure.\u201d\n\nPortico has hired four additional health outreach workers and is partnering with 10 other social service organizations to spread the word about the availability of coverage. \u201cThe four community health workers that were hired specifically to do this work will be constantly rotating through these organizations,\u201d Lozano said. \u201cIt\u2019s really serving the client to the best of our ability in partnership with these other organizations.\u201d\n\nDebra Holmgren, Portico\u2019s president, said that the hiccups in the MNsure rollout haven\u2019t caused significant anxiety about how the system will ultimately function. \u201cHistorically when something new opens up like this, it\u2019s a lot slower start,\u201d Holmgren said. \u201cI think we\u2019re just ready to get started.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "More than three years after passage of the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Minnesota\u2019s health insurance exchange opened for business on Tuesday.
