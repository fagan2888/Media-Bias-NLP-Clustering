In Philadelphia, there are 258.\n\nAccording to The Better Doctor Health Opportunity Index run by BetterDoctor.com, a website that helps consumers find local doctors, Philadelphia is facing a doctor shortage.\n\nComing in sixteenth of 25 cities facing doctor shortages, the City of Brotherly Love has about three times more patients per doctor than Pittsburgh, which ranked fourth on the list of cities with an abundance of doctors. Compare our lack of doctors to the number one city with a wealth of doctors, Greenville, South Carolina; and you\u2019ll find that Philly has five times more patients per physician.\n\nWhat gives?\n\nResearchers who compiled The Better Doctor Health Opportunity Index attribute it to an increased demand for healthcare \u2013 possibly due to Obamacare \u2013 as well as the aging population in many cities.

New York took the number one spot, with 912 residents per doctor, while San Antonio came in second with 531 patients per physician.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re wondering where \u2013 besides Greenville \u2013 there are plenty of physicians, Atlanta, the home of the CDC, came in second, while Boston ranked third.\n\nTo see the full rankings, click here.\n\nMust Read Today\u2019s Top Talkers\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Consider this: In Pittsburgh, there are 87 patients per doctor.
