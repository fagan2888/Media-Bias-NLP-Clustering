But all too often, primary care doctors are too busy to drive the message home.\n\nThe cardiovascular health project addresses \u201csocial determinants of health,\u201d factors such as diet, stress, smoking and lack of exercise that over time lead to serious health problems, said Kaufman, who organized \u201cBeyond Flexner 2015,\u201d a major national conference focusing on the social and economic forces underlying ill health that was hosted by the Health Sciences Center in mid-April.\n\nThe UNM team will use the grant money to develop public health campaigns, provide coaching to help doctors better communicate with patients and send community health workers into patients\u2019 homes to help them overcome barriers to following medical advice, he says.\n\n\u201cThe grant from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality is one of eight highly competitive regional awards built upon approaches recommended under Section 5405 of the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Kaufman says. That section, crafted with the help of UNM faculty, was based in part on the university\u2019s pioneering Health Extension Rural Offices program.\n\nUNM will use its $3 million share of the grant to provide support to 50 primary care practices around the state. The University of Colorado will devote the remaining $12 million to back up 200 practices in their state. Researchers from the two universities will meet soon to trade best practices for improving patient compliance with heart-healthy recommendations, he added.\n\nThe inter-university collaboration exemplifies the vision of the Beyond Flexner conference, which brought together nearly 400 clinicians, researchers, educators, policy makers and insurance industry representatives.\n\nConference attendees pledged to pursue new local, regional and national partnerships to invest in preventive strategies that could dramatically improve health and wellbeing. Future steps could include the creation of a national clearinghouse to compile information about the best ways to tackle the social determinants, Kaufman said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "UNM Health Sciences Center", "description": "The University of New Mexico and University of Colorado will share in a groundbreaking $15 million federal grant to help primary care practices more effectively promote cardiovascular health, it was announced Friday.", "title": "UNM HSC to share in $15 million grant to promote cardiovascular health", "url": "http://hscnews.unm.edu/news/grant-to-promote-cardiovascular-health042415", "image": "http://cms.ipressroom.com.s3.amazonaws.com/180/files/20139/524d9a0ffe058b7b6d01e88b_Art+Kaufman+-+15/Art+Kaufman+-+15_136bfa07-f011-4eb8-aa80-265e29d61c44-prv.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary"}, "description": "The University of New Mexico and University of Colorado will share in a groundbreaking $15 million federal grant to help primary care practices more effectively promote cardiovascular health, it was announced Friday.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe25de\"", "article_summary": "Credit: Paul AkmajianThe University of New Mexico and University of Colorado will share in a groundbreaking $15 million federal grant to help primary care practices more effectively promote cardiovascular health, UNM announced Friday.\nUNM will use its $3 million share of the grant to provide support to 50 primary care practices around the state.\nBy Michael Haederle \u2014 April 24, 2015Art Kaufman, MD, is vice chancellor for community health at the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center.\nThat section, crafted with the help of UNM faculty, was based in part on the university\u2019s pioneering Health Extension Rural Offices program.\nFuture steps could include the creation of a national clearinghouse to compile information about the best ways to tackle the social determinants, Kaufman said."}
