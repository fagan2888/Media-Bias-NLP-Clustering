Abby Wambach's attorney entered a not guilty plea on her behalf at an arraignment Tuesday on a charge of driving under the influence of intoxicants.

Wambach, who won a World Cup with the U.S. national team last summer, was arrested on Saturday night after running a red light in Portland, Oregon, where she lives.
