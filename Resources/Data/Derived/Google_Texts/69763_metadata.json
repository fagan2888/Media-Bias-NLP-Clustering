I absolutely would not agree with that,\" said Carson, who went on the say that the Islamic religion was incompatible with the Constitution.\n\nWith the aforementioned remark, Carson might be upping his game in a way that could appeal to a set of potential voters who have so far kept Donald Trump at the top of the list of conservative candidates.\n\nAs Carson attracts more interest, it is probably a good time to take a look at where he stands on some core issues.\n\nImmigration Reform\n\nCarson believes that mass deportation is moral low road and thinks a guest worker program is a good idea. In his book \u201cAmerica the Beautiful,\u201d Carson seems to question the motives and morality behind the U.S.\u2019 reliance on migrant labor. He wrote, \"Is it moral for us, for example, to take advantage of cheap labor from illegal immigrants while denying them citizenship? I'm sure you can tell from the way I phrased the question that I believe we have taken the moral low road on this issue.\"\n\nSame-sex Marriage\n\nAs reported in On the Issues, Carson disagrees with the decision to legalize same-sex marriage but respects that it is now the law of the land.\n\nObamacare\n\nCarson, whose opinion as medical professional lends some authority to his view, sees\n\nObamacare as all about restriction and control. \"You know Obamacare is really I think the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery,\" Carson said back in 2013. As quoted in the Washington Post, he elaborated that \u201cit is making all of us subservient to the government, and it was never about health care. It was about control.\"\n\nGun Laws\n\nCarson believes that law-abiding citizens have a right to have guns without any registration.\n\nPoverty\n\nCarson\u2019s plan to get rid of poverty seems to be to get rid of dependency. \"I'm not interested in getting rid of a safety net, I'm interested in getting rid of dependency,\" Carson said, as quoted in On the Issues.\n\nAbortion\n\nCarson would like to ban abortion 20 weeks after fertilization. \u201cMy entire professional life has been devoted to saving and enhancing lives,\u201d said Carson in an Op-Ed piece for the Washington Times, \u201cThus, the thought of abortion for the sake of convenience does not appeal to me.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"Description": "As Carson attracts more interest it is probably a good time to take a look at where he stands on some core issues.", "Copyright": "2016 Latin Post", "Author": "Latin Post", "og": {"site_name": "Latin Post", "description": "As Carson attracts more interest it is probably a good time to take a look at where he stands on some core issues.", "title": "Ben Carson's Views on Poverty, Illegal Immigration, Abortion and Same-Sex Marriage", "url": "http://www.latinpost.com/articles/80520/20150921/ben-carson-views-poverty-illegal-immigration-abortion-same-sex-marriage.htm", "image": "http://images.latinpost.com/data/images/full/69649/ben-carson.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "latinpost.com", "description": "As Carson attracts more interest it is probably a good time to take a look at where he stands on some core issues.", "title": "Ben Carson's Views on Poverty, Illegal Immigration, Abortion and Same-Sex Marriage", "url": "http://www.latinpost.com/articles/80520/20150921/ben-carson-views-poverty-illegal-immigration-abortion-same-sex-marriage.htm", "image": "http://images.latinpost.com/data/images/full/69649/ben-carson.jpg", "creator": "@latinpost", "site": "@latinpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "syndication-source": "http://www.latinpost.com/articles/80520/20150921/ben-carson-views-poverty-illegal-immigration-abortion-same-sex-marriage.htm", "robots": "index, follow", "p": {"domain_verify": "35e478f7510504ec71abd594218dee4e"}, "Title": "Latin Post", "Googlebot-News": "index, follow", "Keywords": "Latin Post", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-21"}, "news_keywords": "ben,carson,views,poverty,illegal,immigration,abortion,same,sex,marriage", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "Subject": "Latin Post"}, "article_summary": "Immigration ReformCarson believes that mass deportation is moral low road and thinks a guest worker program is a good idea.\nIn his book \u201cAmerica the Beautiful,\u201d Carson seems to question the motives and morality behind the U.S.\u2019 reliance on migrant labor.\nBen Carson, a retired neurosurgeon-turned-GOP Presidential hopeful, has been slowly winning people over with his quiet campaign.\n\"I'm not interested in getting rid of a safety net, I'm interested in getting rid of dependency,\" Carson said, as quoted in On the Issues.\nSame-sex MarriageAs reported in On the Issues, Carson disagrees with the decision to legalize same-sex marriage but respects that it is now the law of the land."}
