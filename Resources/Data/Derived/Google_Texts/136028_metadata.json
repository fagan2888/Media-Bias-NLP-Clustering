Where\u2019s that happen?\u201d Hemmer wondered aloud, apparently unaware that an interpretation hotline offering 150 languages is offered in New York City, where America\u2019s Newsroom is broadcasted.\n\n\u201cWe can try that out,\u201d MacCallum said. \u201cWe could try to call in and ask if they can answer our questions in Burmese.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow about English?\u201d Hemmer suggested. MacCallum agreed that English would be a \u201cgood start.\u201d\n\nEnglish is the primary language through which the federal and state governments offer information about insurance plans available under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nHemmer and MacCallum weren\u2019t the only ones to take a swipe at Obamacare for trying to reach people who spoke languages other than English. Dana Perino, co-host of the opinion show The Five, tweeted:\n\nOffering Obamacare in 150 languages is absurd. If someone can't speak enough English to fill in forms, what will they explain to a doctor? \u2014 Dana Perino (@DanaPerino) October 2, 2013\n\nThe statement resonated, with nearly 1,400 retweets. But as Latino Rebels pointed out, others pushed back.\n\n.@DanaPerino Not that you actually care, but in communities where these languages are spoken, the doctors speak them too. \u2014 Dana McCallum (@DanaDanger) October 2, 2013\n\nDumbest Commentary About Latinos In 2012 Dumbest Commentary About Latinos In 2012\n\n1 of 9 \"Self-Deportation\" \"Immigrant: Deport thyself.\" Not exactly the kind of message you want to send when you're courting Latino voters. Unsurprisingly, Romney backed away from the phrase shortly after taking it for a test spin in the GOP primary, but it reappeared during the presidential debates. Romney won just 27 percent of the Latino vote, the lowest figure since Bob Dole's campaign in 1996.
