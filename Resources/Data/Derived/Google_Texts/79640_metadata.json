He said he plans to fight poverty and homelessness with federal aid dollars and community outreach.\n\n\u201cPoverty is holding Bloomington back, and it\u2019s hurting our economy,\u201d Hamilton said. \u201cIt\u2019s time we get serious about combating poverty by creating more opportunities for people with low incomes to succeed and move ahead.\u201d\n\nIn his statement, Hamilton said that if elected, he plans to make \u201csource of income\u201d a protected class, meaning those whose primary source of income is partially made up of government aid \u2014 whether it be through a housing voucher, social security or unemployment insurance \u2014 cannot be discriminated against in housing.\n\nPart of Hamilton\u2019s plan is working closely with nonprofits such as ROC USA, which helps low-income individuals buy mobile homes and works with local businesses that can hire disadvantaged residents.\n\n\u201cThen a second (part) is really increasing the collaboration with our city and outside nonprofits, other nonprofits, including ways to promote home ownership,\u201d ?Hamilton said.\n\nThe last part of Hamilton\u2019s plan detailed his vision for IU Health to help provide healthcare access to lower-income residents through continued commitment by IU Health to sign people up under the Affordable Care Act and make clinics easily accessible.\n\nPoverty is a major problem in Bloomington relative to the rest of the country. Statistics from a variety of organizations, including the United States Census Bureau, routinely rank Bloomington as one of the poorest cities in America with a population of more than 65,000.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the percentage of persons below the poverty line in Bloomington was 39.2 percent, compared with the state of Indiana at 15.4 percent. In addition, median household income in Bloomington from 2009 to 2013 was $27,396, compared to $48,248 in the state overall.\n\nStatistics are skewed by the amount of students who live and work in Bloomington, many of whom rely on their parents for financial assistance or are part-time employees. But even factoring students into the equation, Hamilton said poverty in Bloomington is a major issue.\n\nHamilton also said he plans to change language in the city Unified Development Ordinance in order to provide more affordable housing for residents.\n\n\u201cWell, I would like to see language that commits us to more affordable housing ... we ought to pursue an annual revenue stream for affordable housing, which we don\u2019t have, and I would like to see the UDO reflect that commitment as well as the concept of long term or permanent ?affordability.\u201d\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the average rent per month in Bloomington is $782 compared to $730 for the state. The Indianapolis Star reported Bloomington has the highest average rent out of any city in Indiana, ahead of Columbus and Indianapolis.\n\n\u201cAs a community, Bloomington is committed to equality and justice \u2014 that means economic justice too,\u201d Hamilton said. \u201cWe can be the generation that makes our city one that truly works for ?everyone.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hamilton calls press conference to outline his plan on poverty", "generator": "Gryphon 20160217001 (Foundry 6.1-20150615001)", "og": {"url": "http://www.idsnews.com/article/2015/04/hamilton-outlines-poverty-plan", "image": "http://duvq7ua50whdw.cloudfront.net/20160412QJeR6mqyqZ/dist/img/IDS-fb-icon.png", "type": "article", "description": "Hamilton calls press conference to outline his plan on poverty", "title": "Hamilton outlines poverty plan"}, "twitter": {"site": "@idsnews", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.ids/57457_img_2932webf.jpg", "description": "Hamilton calls press conference to outline his plan on poverty", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Hamilton outlines poverty plan"}, "keywords": "Indiana University, IU, Bloomington, Indiana, Monroe County, Indiana Daily Student, IDS, student newspaper, newspaper, news, students, college, university, campus, Ernie Pyle", "google-site-verification": "FkL7grEXumouo-bfJ89mrCvOGorioiCTNQ4t4X3bjjI", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "But even factoring students into the equation, Hamilton said poverty in Bloomington is a major issue.\n\u201cPoverty is holding Bloomington back, and it\u2019s hurting our economy,\u201d Hamilton said.\nHamilton also said he plans to change language in the city Unified Development Ordinance in order to provide more affordable housing for residents.\nHe said he plans to fight poverty and homelessness with federal aid dollars and community outreach.\n\u201cThen a second (part) is really increasing the collaboration with our city and outside nonprofits, other nonprofits, including ways to promote home ownership,\u201d ?Hamilton said."}
