Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.) continued to voice her discontent with Obamacare on Thursday, entering the realm of personal struggles.

Hours after President Barack Obama issued a mea culpa for the White House's fumbling of the Affordable Care Act's rollout, Bachmann told CNN's "The Situation Room" that she had lost her insurance and would be forced to enter Washington D.C.'s exchange.

When asked by host Wolf Blitzer if she planned to enroll, Bachmann dismissed the glitchy website.

“Are you kidding?” Bachmann said, adding that she would wait until the technical issues were fixed. “I’m not gonna waste an hour on that thing.”

Bachmann's comments arrived one day after she hammered at how the Obamacare struggles are harming Democrats' 2014 election efforts. That element of backlash was also addressed by Obama on Thursday, when he said there was no doubt the ACA rollout failure has "put a burden on Democrats, whether they're running or not, because they stood up and supported this."

“That’s why they are all running, screaming looking for any corner that they can go to where they can say, ‘Gee, not me, not me.’ When actually it’s their fault,” Bachmann said Wednesday.
