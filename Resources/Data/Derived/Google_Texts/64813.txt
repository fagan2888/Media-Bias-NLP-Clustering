In Texas City, Texas, Mark Oberholtzer’s plumbing business has been in decline since a video was posted showing his work truck being used as an anti-personnel vehicle for ISIS.

Oberholtzer sold his Ford F-250 to a local dealership in Texas City without removing the decals. The truck ended up in an auction in Turkey, which obviously led to its sale to ISIS.

Once the public saw the video, Oberholtzer received thousands of phone calls and even death threats.

"By the end of the day, Mark-1's office, Mark-1's business phone, and Mark's personal cell had received over 1,000 phone calls from around the nation… these phone calls were in large part harassing and contained countless threats of violence, property harm, injury and even death," Oberholzer's lawyer said.

Oberholtzer fled town and had to temporarily shut down his business. After having to deal with the FBI and Homeland Security, Oberholtzer filed lawsuit against the Ford dealership who bought the truck for not removing his company’s decals.
