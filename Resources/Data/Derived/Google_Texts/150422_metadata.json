During that time, the facility will be closed for open public skating but remain open for high school games and practices.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to provide modernized amenities for skaters while creating a venue that can remain in use year-round for a variety of purposes,\u201d said Freeholder Chairman Mohamed S. Jalloh. \u201cThe Warinanco Park Skating Rink was considered a state-of-the-art facility when it opened in 1961, and we are looking forward to an exciting update that will restore its prominence.\u201d\n\nElements of the renovation/modernization include:\n\n\u2022 A new state-of-the-art field house that will measure 11,000 square feet and include a room for parties, a food concession area, a video game room, a retail pro shop and skate rental room;\n\n\u2022 A new exterior seating area that will be covered, protecting patrons from the elements;\n\n\u2022 The rink\u2019s refrigeration building will be renovated;\n\n\u2022 A new ice rink floor (covering the same footprint) including new refrigeration piping, LEED lighting and reflective ceiling that will be made from a material that will help prevent humidity build-up;\n\n\u2022 New bleachers and flooring surrounding the ice floor, as well as new boards, glass and nets;\n\n\u2022 A new gas fireplace \u2014 stone-covered and running the height of the building;\n\n\u2022 Team locker rooms will be remodeled.\n\n\u201cThe Warinanco Park Skating Rink is a place where generations of families have made memories and will continue to do so once the renovations are complete,\u201d said Freeholder Sergio Granados, who is also the board\u2019s parks liaison. \u201cWe look forward to cutting the ribbon next year on the imaginative re-creation of this landmark.\u201d\n\nThe rink will become known as the Warinanco Sports Center once the project is complete. In the spring and summer once the ice is removed, field turf will be laid on the rink floor and baseball/softball batting cages will be added, as well as an infield, to service the large number of baseball and softball leagues that use the park.\n\nMost parts of the facility are in an advanced state of deterioration and will be torn down and replaced by new construction and signage. Mar-Bridge Enterprises of Matawan is the general contractor, and Netta Architects of Mountainside has designed the new facility.\n\nThe rink, which is on the Roselle side of the park, was part of the original plans for the park drawn up in the 1920s. It was finally built and opened as an outdoor facility in October 1961 with much fanfare. The opening program featured group and solo exhibitions from local professional and amateur skaters, a peewee hockey game and speedskating. The rate card billed the rink as \u201cThe First Public Artificial Ice Skating Rink in Union County.\u201d\n\nThe rink was built in what was then known as the Spinning Woods area of Warinanco Park and cost $225,000 to construct. It required 216 tons of sand for the base and 32 tons of crystal spar.\n\nA roof was added in 1969, making the ice surface usable in all weather conditions. The rink is home ice for hockey teams from five Union County high schools and is used by nearly 50,000 skaters each year.\n\nWarinanco Park has seen extensive renovations, culminating over the past year with the opening of the new athletic turf field and track area on the Roselle side, and a new sprayground/playground sports area on the Elizabeth side, across from the Boat House.\n\nLocated in the City of Elizabeth and the Borough of Roselle, Warinanco Park, which opened in the mid 1920s, comprises 205 acres of developed park land, and was originally designed by the Olmsted Firm.\n\nBeginning in 1857 with the design for Central Park in New York City, Frederick Law Olmsted (1822-1903), his sons and successor firm created designs for more than 6,000 landscapes across North America, including many of the world\u2019s most important parks.\n\nFor generations of Union County residents, Warinanco Park is arguably the county\u2019s most well-known recreational facility. While it is deceivingly small in size, the park\u2019s many features make it appear as if it were actually much bigger.\n\nWarinanco Park has four distinct areas: the Central Park area, the boathouse/playground area, the skating center and the track area.\n\nSome other popular attractions include the Chatfield Gardens, the park\u2019s Great Walk area, tennis courts, ball fields and par-course fitness route. In the spring, the park is noted for its colorful blooms of cherry blossoms, dogwood trees and azaleas.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://mycj.co/1Lkr0n9", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Warinanco Park Skating Rink will undergo $7 million modernization and renovation and renamed Warinanco Sports Center", "og": {"site_name": "MY CENTRAL JERSEY", "description": "Warinanco Park Skating Rink will undergo $7 million modernization and renovation and renamed Warinanco Sports Center", "title": "Warinanco Skating Rink to undergo renovations", "url": "http://www.mycentraljersey.com/story/news/local/union-county/2015/06/19/warinanco-skating-rink-renovations/28999599/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/mycentraljersey.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Warinanco Park Skating Rink will undergo $7 million modernization and renovation and renamed Warinanco Sports Center", "title": "Warinanco Skating Rink to undergo renovations", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d76867893ae552e1c13e53fd7c150068a6930d25/c=364-0-1011-647&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/06/19/Bridgewater/B9317790930Z.1_20150619162826_000_G08B4KESP.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@MyCentralJersey", "site": "@MyCentralJersey", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=859380356", "fb": {"app_id": 177893718898560}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Roselle Park, Warinanco Park, renovations, skating rink"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5620\"", "article_summary": "Warinanco Park has four distinct areas: the Central Park area, the boathouse/playground area, the skating center and the track area.\n\u201cThe Warinanco Park Skating Rink is a place where generations of families have made memories and will continue to do so once the renovations are complete,\u201d said Freeholder Sergio Granados, who is also the board\u2019s parks liaison.\nThe rate card billed the rink as \u201cThe First Public Artificial Ice Skating Rink in Union County.\u201dThe rink was built in what was then known as the Spinning Woods area of Warinanco Park and cost $225,000 to construct.\nFor generations of Union County residents, Warinanco Park is arguably the county\u2019s most well-known recreational facility.\nLocated in the City of Elizabeth and the Borough of Roselle, Warinanco Park, which opened in the mid 1920s, comprises 205 acres of developed park land, and was originally designed by the Olmsted Firm."}
