Six clinics, intended to serve more than 13 million women across a state nearly 300,000 square miles in size, concentrated in five of the state\u2019s largest metropolitan areas and leaving virtually the entire western portion of Texas \u2014 the Panhandle, the Rio Grande Valley \u2014 without reproductive care. The clinics that remain open in September will be able to do so only because they meet the new standards outlined in H.B. 2, the extreme anti-choice legislation that Wendy Davis spent 11 hours filibustering last June, which mandates abortion providers meet the guidelines for ambulatory surgical centers. These standards can cost up to $40,000 a month to maintain, and have already forced clinics across the state to shut down. With abortion providers in the western part of the state shuttered, women who live in the region \u2014 particularly the Valley \u2014 are left without options.\n\nThe aftermath of Texas\u2019s radical restrictions on reproductive rights is no longer hypothetical. To capture the harsh reality now faced by hundreds of thousands of the state\u2019s women, most of them poor, Cosmopolitan\u2019s Jill Filipovic recently traveled to the Rio Grande Valley and made the journey a woman must take to retain control of her reproductive choices \u2014 specifically, the four-hour-plus drive from Brownsville, the Valley\u2019s largest city, to San Antonio, where the nearest clinic is located. Despite being portrayed as \u201cnot impossibly burdensome,\u201d the roadblocks to abortion are numerous and often insurmountable, as Filipovic describes:\n\nThere\u2019s no public transportation linking the Valley to San Antonio, so women need access to a car \u2014 something many Valley residents don\u2019t have \u2014 and money for gas, which can cost more than what a Valley woman makes in a whole day. Driving nearly 300 miles and then having an ultrasound or an abortion means a woman has to take the whole day off work, and women in the Valley, who are likely to work in textile manufacturing or in the fields or as cleaning staff, often don\u2019t get paid if they don\u2019t work. According to abortion providers\u2019 surveys of patients, some 70 percent of Valley women who terminate pregnancies already have children, so driving to San Antonio means paying for childcare too. And since Texas law requires two in-person clinic visits, one for counseling and an ultrasound, and one for the abortion a full 24 hours later, having an abortion means doing all of this twice, or paying to stay overnight in a hotel.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A chilling photo essay reveals the aftermath of the state's extreme anti-choice laws", "author": "Jenny Kutner", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "A chilling photo essay reveals the aftermath of the state's extreme anti-choice laws", "title": "How to get an abortion in Texas", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/07/17/how_to_get_an_abortion_in_texas/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/11/antiabortion_protest-620x4121.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A chilling photo essay reveals the aftermath of the state's extreme anti-choice laws", "creator": "@@JennyKutner", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/11/antiabortion_protest-620x4121.jpg", "title": "How to get an abortion in Texas", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "How to get an abortion in Texas", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Abortion, anti-choice, anti-choice legislation, hb2, Jill Filipovic, Pro-choice, Reproductive choice, Reproductive Rights, rio grande valley, Texas, Wendy Davis", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda34b\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Abortion, anti-choice, anti-choice legislation, hb2, Jill Filipovic, Pro-choice, Reproductive choice, Reproductive Rights, rio grande valley, Texas, Wendy Davis, Life News, Politics NewsCome September, there will be six abortion clinics in Texas.\nAnd since Texas law requires two in-person clinic visits, one for counseling and an ultrasound, and one for the abortion a full 24 hours later, having an abortion means doing all of this twice, or paying to stay overnight in a hotel.\nAccording to abortion providers\u2019 surveys of patients, some 70 percent of Valley women who terminate pregnancies already have children, so driving to San Antonio means paying for childcare too.\nWith abortion providers in the western part of the state shuttered, women who live in the region \u2014 particularly the Valley \u2014 are left without options.\n2, the extreme anti-choice legislation that Wendy Davis spent 11 hours filibustering last June, which mandates abortion providers meet the guidelines for ambulatory surgical centers."}
