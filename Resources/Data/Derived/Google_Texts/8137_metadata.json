Tim Huelskamp said the congressman\u2019s primary opponents would \u201ccapitulate to the Left\u201d if elected and castigated their opinions on immigration and health care.\n\n\u201cAnd if Hillary Clinton is elected, the last thing we need is someone like my opponents whose stated goal is to work with her,\u201d the email newsletter said, referring to the Democratic front-runner.\n\nThe three-term tea party Republican often is criticized by his political opponents for his unwillingness to work with Democrats or more moderate Republicans, such as House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio. Huelskamp is facing two Republican opponents in next year\u2019s August primary, Great Bend obstetrician Roger Marshall and Clyde student retention specialist Alan LaPolice.\n\nLaPolice said Huelskamp\u2019s \u201cangry emails\u201d are used to spread \u201cfear and misinformation\u201d while raising money.\n\n\u201cThe common thread of his angry essays is that \u2018everybody else is trying to destroy America and he\u2019s the only one standing in their way,\u2019 \u201d\n\nLaPolice said in an email Sunday. \u201cWhat you\u2019ll never hear from him is a plan. What we\u2019ve never seen from him is even a single proposed solution to America\u2019s very real problems.\u201d\n\n\u201cTim Huelskamp can\u2019t help himself,\u201d Marshall added, \u201chis entire time serving in Congress and now this campaign continues to be about tearing people down instead of building America up. He continues to pass along misinformation for his personal political gain.\u201d\n\nMark Kelly, Huelskamp's campaign spokesman, responded to LaPolice and Marshall on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cIf Tim Huelskamp\u2019s opponents were conservatives like they claim, they\u2019d support Tim Huelskamp and his proven conservative record,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cInstead Roger Marshall and Alan LaPolice are attacking Tim for doing exactly what Kansans want him to do.\u201d\n\nThe subject line of Huelskamp\u2019s email was \u201cLast Night\u2019s Debate\u201d and it centered on the Republican presidential debate Thursday. Huelskamp said he agreed with much of what he heard from the candidates.\n\n\u201cBut we cannot just stop at ensuring the right, principled conservative candidate is in the White House,\u201d Huelskamp stated. \u201cWhen that person takes office on January 20, 2017, they need leaders with a proven conservative record in Congress to work with them.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you agree, will you make a contribution to my campaign right now?\u201d the email asked.\n\n\u201cI have never met any of the elites in Washington and will put Kansans ahead of my own personal political urges,\u201d Marshall said in response. \u201cI will do everything I can to restore a Kansas voice on the Ag committee. In doing so, I will likely disagree with Washington leadership on some issues, but I will never be disagreeable to the detriment of those who elected me to represent them.\u201d\n\nIn a blistering paragraph, the Huelskamp campaign slung three charges against LaPolice and Marshall.\n\n\u201cMy opponents refuse to commit to a complete repeal of ObamaCare,\u201d Huelskamp\u2019s campaign wrote. \u201cThey call for things like a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants. They stood silent in the face of the atrocities revealed at Planned Parenthood.\u201d\n\nDuring an interview July 16, Marshall stopped short of calling for a repeal of the Affordable Care Act but said the federal government should instead give block grants to states and allow them to implement their own health care reforms.\n\nLaPolice, meanwhile, has called for a repeal of the Affordable Care Act. During an interview July 25, LaPolice said the federal health care law should be repealed and replaced by programs in each state to help people obtain health insurance, a similar proposal to that of Marshall\u2019s.\n\n\u201cThe interesting fact is that I have, for nearly two years now, been the only candidate who has proposed an actual replacement for the ACA,\u201d LaPolice said Sunday, referring to his 2014 congressional run. \u201cI\u2019ve yet to hear Huelskamp even hint at what he would replace it with.\u201d\n\nHuelskamp, like all members of the state\u2019s House delegation, was a co-sponsor of the American Health Care Reform Act in 2013 to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThough LaPolice and Marshall have said they are opposed to amnesty for undocumented immigrants, both have indicated their support for further employment opportunities.\n\n\u201cThere has to be a pathway to at least have a job,\u201d Marshall said in the July 16 interview. \u201cI\u2019m not ready to jump on the amnesty bandwagon just yet, but we need to find a way to get these people into the system.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, Marshall reiterated those statements, saying, \u201cI favor immigration reform that secures our border and helps our farmers employ the legal workers they need. I oppose any and all amnesty.\u201d\n\nOn the issue of Planned Parenthood, LaPolice said he wishes Planned Parenthood would stop participating in \u201cabortion-related activities\u201d but added that he is disappointed in politicians who have used recent scandals surrounding Planned Parenthood to further their campaigns.\n\n\u201cIf the congressman wants to again shut down our government over this, let him,\u201d LaPolice said. \u201cHe can once again fall on that sword and voters will see where his priorities are.\u201d\n\nTwo weeks ago, in a letter to Republican congressional leaders, Huelskamp joined 17 other conservative House members in stating he wouldn\u2019t support legislation this fall to fund the government if it includes funding for Planned Parenthood.\n\n\u201cTim Huelskamp\u2019s record is conservative, constitutional and reflects Kansas values,\u201d Kelly said.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "News, State, Justin Wingerter", "og": {"site_name": "CJOnline.com", "description": "In a fundraising email Friday, the re-election campaign of U.S. Rep.
