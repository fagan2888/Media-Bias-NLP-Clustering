I recently saw “Terracotta Warriors 3D” at the Newman Center. It is an incredible show full of acrobatic dancing, beautiful, authentic costumes, music, and a story of the first Emperor of China — with a 3D background. I guarantee it is a show unlike anything you have ever seen before. The only disappointment was the sparse crowd. People, Denver is the first city in the United States to experience this. We are supposed to have culture. Get out and support this amazing show and pass the word on.

I’m not sure why the corpse flower has gotten so much more attention than this show. I’d much rather go and see 90 minutes of awe than 10 minutes of a stinky flower (although it would be neat to see as well).
