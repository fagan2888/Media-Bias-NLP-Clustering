John Cornyn portrayed himself Friday night as an agent of change in Washington as rival David Alameel blasted him for blocking immigration reforms while kowtowing to Wall Street.\n\nThis was the first and only debate of the contest, as Cornyn seeks a third term and Alameel claws for traction.\n\nWith Univision as the debate host, a hefty chunk of the questioning was aimed at immigration policy \u2014 an area of especially clear disagreement.\n\nCornyn, who has long resisted legalization for the 11 million people in the country illegally, called himself a \u201cstrong supporter of immigration reform.\u201d He agreed that young people brought to the country illegally by their parents \u2014 the \u201cDreamers\u201d \u2014 should be eligible for college aid.\n\nBut he called it politically impossible to pass a \u201ccomprehensive\u201d overhaul and argued for taking smaller steps with broader support.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t hold my breath for Republicans to offer you any immigration reform,\u201d Alameel said.\n\nThe vast majority of immigrants have been in this country for years, breaking no laws and working hard, and they \u201cdeserve a path to citizenship,\u201d he said.\n\nCornyn proposed a flexible cap on immigrant visas, fluctuating with the U.S. economy and needs of employers.\n\n\u201cOf course we need to increase quotas,\u201d Alameel shot back, adding that this sidestepped the core issue, citizenship. Without that, he said, \u201cit will take us a hundred years to give the relief that our Latino community deserves.\u201d\n\nThe debate, at Mountain View College in Dallas, offered Alameel a rare shot at making headway against an incumbent who enjoys a huge edge in name identification and fund-raising. He labeled Cornyn a \u201cdo-nothing senator. Our country burns while Cornyn fiddles.\u201d\n\nThese and other barbs may not be seen widely enough to make much difference. The Dallas Univision station and Texas Tribune streamed the debate live online. Univision viewers can watch the debate in Spanish on Saturday night. C-Span will broadcast it Wednesday night in English.\n\nCornyn, the No. 2 GOP leader in the Senate, portrayed Alameel as a potential reinforcement for Democrats in the final two years of the Obama administration.\n\n\u201cWhat we need is new leadership and a new direction. We don\u2019t need people who will go to Washington and support the status quo \u2014 the obstruction of the majority leader and the policies of the president,\u201d Cornyn said.\n\nAlameel asserted that Wall Street interests control the Republican Party and \u201cJohn Cornyn is one of the leaders of that establishment, who only care about themselves\u2026. He\u2019s turning our country into a minimum-wage nation and we say enough is enough.\u201d\n\nThey disagreed on a host of issues.\n\nCornyn called it \u201cdangerous\u201d to make marijuana legal, even for medical purposes. Alameel argued for full decriminalization. \u201cHaving prohibition didn\u2019t work,\u201d he said.\n\nCornyn reiterated his dim view of the Affordable Care Act. Alameel called Obamacare \u201ca good step in the right direction\u201d and argued that \u201cRepublicans have to stop saying no\u201d and should work to improve it.\n\nBoth called it a bad idea to make English the nation\u2019s official language, though unlike Cornyn, Alameel said government documents should be offered in a variety of languages to ensure that people who haven\u2019t learned English aren\u2019t \u201cabandoned.\u201d\n\nOn the Ebola crisis, Alameel agreed with calls coming mostly from Republicans in Congress \u2013 and a few Democrats \u2013 for a travel ban on West Africa. \u201cIn any epidemic you have to restrict the flow in and out of that affected area,\u201d he said.\n\nBoth noted the lack of preparedness by Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas.\n\n\u201cThere was no leadership from the White House and from the federal government,\u201d Cornyn said.\n\nAlameel also worries about lack of preparations. \u201cIf we have an epidemic, the first nine patients will be taken care of, and the other 100,000 will die,\u201d he said.\n\nAlameel was asked about the $15,000 or so he donated to Cornyn a decade ago.\n\n\u201cThis is one terrible mistake I have to live with,\u201d he said.\n\nCornyn wasn\u2019t about to let his rival off the hook so easily. \u201cHe was an enthusiastic supporter of mine and Governor Perry \u2026 and Republicans up and down the ticket,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the president\u2019s handling of the Islamic State terrorist group, Cornyn blasted the refusal to put American \u201cboots on the ground.\u201d Alameel lauded the president for bombing the Islamic State but warned that \u201cwe don\u2019t need to create another big war.\u201d\n\nSocial issues offered more bright lines.\n\nCornyn defended Texas\u2019 tough law imposing requirements that forced most of the state\u2019s abortion clinics to close. Alameel said that as a Catholic he doesn\u2019t believe in abortion but wants it to be legal and available.\n\nOn same-sex marriage, Cornyn said that \u201cI am pro-traditional marriage\u201d and wants the federal government to respect Texas\u2019 views that marriage should only be between a man and a woman.\n\nSaid Alameel, \u201cWe should move on from these divisive issues.\u201d\n\nStaff writer Michael Marks contributed to this report.\n\nFollow Todd J.
