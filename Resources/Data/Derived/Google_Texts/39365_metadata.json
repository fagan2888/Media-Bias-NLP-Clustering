She was 98.\n\nTo honor her lifelong dedication to the community, the YMCA on Centre Avenue opened in 2012 as the Thelma Lovette YMCA. She was the first woman to serve on both the board of the Hill District's Centre Avenue YMCA and the board of the YMCA of Greater Pittsburgh.\n\n\u201cShe and her family are the archetype of stalwarts in the Hill District,\u201d former City Councilman Sala Udin said. \u201cShe loved the Hill District, and she was dedicated to doing what she could to improve the lives of people who lived there.\u201d\n\nMrs. Lovette was the fifth of 11 children born to Alice and Henry Williams. Mrs. Lovette's father started a plumbing business on Crawford Street in 1919. Her oldest brother, Robert E. \u201cPappy\u201d Williams, was the first black magistrate in Pennsylvania, an ally of Mayor David L. Lawrence and a powerful Democratic chairman of the city's 5th Ward.\n\nAnother brother, Frank, worked as a deputy County Controller under Frank Lucchino, now a senior Allegheny County judge. Her third brother, Jacob, was a district justice. Her husband, Bill, became a plumber.\n\nMrs. Lovette's own political career consisted of 35 years as a Democratic committeewoman. She turned down patronage jobs that politicians gave ward leaders in exchange for delivering votes. Mrs. Lovette washed dishes, became an elevator operator at Bell Telephone and was a team mother, akin to a teachers' aide, in the team teaching program at Pittsburgh Public Schools.\n\nMrs. Lovette became the first black social worker at Mercy Hospital. While she worked there, she earned her bachelor's and master's degrees in social work from the University of Pittsburgh. She would attend classes in the day and work evenings and weekends while in her 50s. She worked 18 years at the Uptown hospital.\n\n\u201cShe always said, \u2018Whatever you do, be the best at whatever you're doing, and other opportunities will come your way,' \u201d Morris said of her mother.\n\nWhen Morris' husband, Gregory, took his mother-in-law grocery shopping in the South Side, Morris said, they would be greeted by people who knew Mrs. Lovette from her work at Mercy, saying, \u201cYou told me to do such and such to get a better job, and I did that and I got a better job.\u201d\n\nMrs. Lovette participated in the 1963 march on Washington, witnessing Martin Luther King Jr. giving his famous \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech. Morris said her mother participated in other civil rights demonstrations in Pittsburgh.\n\n\u201cShe would go and march, but she wasn't loud,\u201d Morris said. \u201cShe would make her point quietly and subtly.\u201d\n\nDuring rioting following the King assassination in 1968, Mrs. Lovette confronted a group of men who had kicked in the front door of a store along Wylie Avenue.\n\n\u201cShe said that outsiders had come in to burn down our stores and our businesses,\u201d Morris said.\n\nMrs. Lovette's last trip to the Hill District was during the April 2012 dedication of the YMCA, Morris said. When she visited her namesake, said Shannel Givner, the facility's youth development director, Mrs. Lovette radiated joy.\n\n\u201cShe was just so vibrant,\u201d Givner said. \u201cIt was a dream come true for her.\u201d\n\nLongtime equality activist and civil rights leader Alma Speed Fox said Saturday that Mrs. Lovette was a trailblazer for blacks in the Hill District. Her activism allowed them opportunities that had been unattainable.\n\n\u201cShe and her family had strong political ties, and growing up in the Hill District, they had a lot more access than most. They opened a lot of doors for others,\u201d Fox said.\n\nFuneral arrangements were incomplete in Arizona, Mrs. Lovette's daughter said. An Aug. 1 memorial is planned for Pittsburgh, though details have not been finalized.\n\nBill Vidonic is a staff writer for Trib Total Media.
