It was a dumb thing to say. What really ticked off Rockies players was Tulowitzki\u2019s comment, \u201cGuys got comfortable because it was so nice.\u201d\n\nThe most common refrain around Salt River Fields? It\u2019s past time for Tulo to get over last summer\u2019s trade.\n\n\u2022 Carlos Gonzalez is not only in terrific shape, he seems happier and more relaxed in camp than he has been in years. Not having to endure rehab all winter is a big reason for that. If he\u2019s worried about trade rumors catching fire again this summer, he\u2019s sure not showing it.\n\n\u2022 I tweeted out a photo of Gonzalez the first week of camp, and a lot of fans noticed how huge his biceps are. For a major-league outfielder, it\u2019s not always wise to build up big guns, the theory being that big biceps can negatively affect the throwing motion.\n\nCarGo says he\u2019s not worried.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s important for me when I\u2019m lifting hard is I want to be flexible, so I stretched a lot with my upper body and my lower body,\u201d Gonzalez told Thomas Harding of MLB.com. \u201cAfter working out, I was sure that I\u2019d run and I always played catch. It was part of my routine.\n\n\u201cIt can affect you if you don\u2019t throw. I\u2019d lift in the mornings, work pretty hard, then run. And in the afternoon, I\u2019d do my whole baseball program so that it doesn\u2019t affect me.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Looking for a dark-horse candidate to make the roster? Try right-handed relief prospect Carlos Estevez. In his first two Cactus League outings, the 23-year-old stuck out five, showing a blazing fastball. He\u2019s also beginning to master a nasty slider. He struck out 68 in 55 \u2154 combined relief innings at Single-A Advanced Modesto and Double-A New Britain last season.\n\n\u201cPower arm with very good secondary stuff, too. He\u2019s got a great changeup,\u201d manager Walt Weiss said. \u201cThere\u2019s some deception there, too, with his delivery. It\u2019s a little funky. He\u2019s looked good so far.\u201d\n\n\u2022 If I were Bridich, I would be thinking very hard about making Trevor Story my starting shortstop. If I\u2019m Weiss, I push for it to happen.\n\nI think Story, 23, is ready for the majors right now \u2014 and not just because he hit a 442-foot homer last week.\n\nStory impresses me with his work ethic, athleticism and passion. Still, history tells us the Rockies could make Story wait a bit longer. In 2013, Nolan Arenado played 18 games at Triple-A Colorado Springs, where he batted .364 with 14 extra-base hits, before he got the call.\n\n\u2022 Raimel Tapia, the 6-foot-2, 165-pound outfielder, has caught a lot of attention early in spring. He flags down balls in the gap with great speed and an excellent jump. He has an unorthodox approach at the plate, but, as Clint Hurdle likes to say, \u201cThe kid puts the barrel to the baseball.\u201d\n\nTapia, 22, probably will begin the season at Double-A Hartford, but he\u2019s an exciting player and worth keeping an eye on.\n\nPatrick Saunders: psaunders@denver- post.com or @psaundersdp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Saunders: Troy Tulowitzki\u2019s jab, Carlos Gonzalez\u2019s mood, Trevor Story\u2019s chance highlight Rockies\u2019 spring", "title": "Saunders: Troy Tulowitzki\u2019s jab, Carlos Gonzalez\u2019s mood, Trevor Story\u2019s chance highlight Rockies\u2019 spring", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/03/05/saunders-troy-tulowitzkis-jab-carlos-gonzalezs-mood-trevor-storys-chance-highlight-rockies-spring/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-05T21:58:26+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-23T02:25:12+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Patrick Saunders"}, "article_summary": "He\u2019s looked good so far.\u201d\u2022 If I were Bridich, I would be thinking very hard about making Trevor Story my starting shortstop.\nWhat really ticked off Rockies players was Tulowitzki\u2019s comment, \u201cGuys got comfortable because it was so nice.\u201dThe most common refrain around Salt River Fields?\n\u2022 Carlos Gonzalez is not only in terrific shape, he seems happier and more relaxed in camp than he has been in years.\n\u2022 I tweeted out a photo of Gonzalez the first week of camp, and a lot of fans noticed how huge his biceps are.\nIf he\u2019s worried about trade rumors catching fire again this summer, he\u2019s sure not showing it."}
