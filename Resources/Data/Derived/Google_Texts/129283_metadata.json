We knew that even before tonight. Glad he and @WesleyLowery are ok,\u201d Fallon tweeted.\n\nJake Tapper responded to Fallon, highlighting the ironic fact that the Department of Justice is currently threatening a New York Times journalist \u2014 James Risen \u2014 with jail time if he refuses to give up an anonymous source for details about the CIA in his 2006 book.\n\nTapper tweeted, \u201c@brianefallon how do you distinguish between the \u2018gutsy\u2019 reporters and the one the administration is threatening to put in jail?\u201d\n\nSpecifically, the Department of Justice is ordering James Risen to testify against a source for his book \u201cState of War,\u201d which contained sensitive information about the CIA. Risen has been fighting back, claiming he will go to prison before naming his source.\n\nBoth Lowery and Reilly were arrested Wednesday by police in Ferguson while trying to report on and film the chaos there following the shooting and killing of Michael Brown by police this past weekend.\n\n(H/T The Huffington Post)", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Brian Fallon, who is the Office of Public Affairs director at the Department of Justice, took to Twitter Wednesday to support journalists Wesley Lowery of The Washington Post and Ryan Reilly of The Huffington Post, both of whom were arrested while covering the protests in Ferguson, Missouri...", "title": "Jake Tapper calls out Department of Justice spokesman for tweet...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2014/03/23177_003_0519_R-600x400.jpg", "height": 400}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2014/08/14/jake-tapper-calls-department-justice-spokesman-tweet-journalists-arrested-ferguson/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "wesley-lowery-ryan-reilly-arrested", "published_time": "2014-08-14T15:53:46+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-14T15:53:46+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Jake Tapper calls out Department of Justice spokesman for tweet about journalists arrested in FergusonCNN\u2019s Jake Tapper harnessed his right to free speech perfectly Wednesday by calling out the Department of Justice for superficially standing up for the First Amendment rights of the press.\nBoth Lowery and Reilly were arrested Wednesday by police in Ferguson while trying to report on and film the chaos there following the shooting and killing of Michael Brown by police this past weekend.\nRisen has been fighting back, claiming he will go to prison before naming his source.\nBrian Fallon, who is the Office of Public Affairs director at the Department of Justice, took to Twitter Wednesday to support journalists Wesley Lowery of The Washington Post and Ryan Reilly of The Huffington Post, both of whom were arrested while covering the riots in Ferguson, Missouri, this week.\n\u201cDOJ is lucky to have a gutsy reporter like @Ryanjreilly on our beat."}
