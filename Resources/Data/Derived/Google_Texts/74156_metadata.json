Jeff Sessions (R-AL).\n\n\u201cBecause of this decision, countless aliens in Alaska, Arizona, California, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Washington, and several territories, who abuse alcohol to the extent that they are habitually drunk \u2013 even those with multiple driving-under-the-influence convictions \u2013 will now be eligible for benefits under our immigration laws,\u201d Grassley and Sessions, the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Immigration and the National Interest, wrote Tuesday in a letter, obtained by Breitbart News, to Attorney General Loretta Lynch.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nLast month the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals struck down the long-held statute, passed by Congress, rejecting aliens who are \u201chabitual drunkards\u201d from being defined as a person of \u201cgood moral character\u201d when considering the alien for immigration benefits. The court specifically held that since alcoholism is a disease it does not have bearing on a person\u2019s character.\n\nAccording to Grassley and Sessions, not only does the Court\u2019s holding smack of judicial activism but is places the nation\u2019s communities at risk.\n\n\u201cThere is a rational basis to deny immigration benefits to habitual drunkards, as distinguished from alcoholics who do not drink, in light of their manifest threat to public health and safety,\u201d the lawmakers wrote in their letter to Lynch. The letter went on to say:\n\nYet the Ninth Circuit failed to recognize this clear rational basis, and concluded that it was unconstitutional to deny immigration benefits to a Mexican national living in the United States illegally, whose medical records document a \u201cten-year history of alcohol abuse, during which he drank an average of one liter of tequila each day,\u201d \u2013 and whose abuse of alcohol led to at least one DUI conviction. As noted by the dissent, alcohol accounts for up to 55% of fatal driving events.\n\nGrassley and Sessions further chastised the holding as a usurpation of Congress\u2019s authority to determine who is allowed to remain in the U.S. and for how long, pointing out that the Supreme Court \u201chas repeatedly emphasized that \u2018over no conceivable subject is the legislative power of Congress more complete than it is over\u2019 the admission of aliens.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf Congress directs the Executive to deny immigration benefits to an alien because he is a habitual drunkard, the Judiciary must ensure fidelity to the plainly written direction of Congress \u2013 not to rewrite the law because it disagrees with the policy decision,\u201d they wrote.\n\nGrassley and Sessions pressed Lynch and the Justice Department to defend the statute and explain to them by May 6 how it plans to move forward with the case.\n\nRead the letter:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Grassley, Sessions Blast Appeals Court for Opening Immigration Benefits to \u2018Habitual Drunkards\u2019", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Grassley, Sessions Blast Appeals Court for Opening Immigration Benefits to \u2018Habitual Drunkards\u2019", "title": "Grassley, Sessions Blast Appeals Court for Opening Immigration Benefits to \u2018Habitual Drunkards\u2019 - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/04/carlos-martinelly-montano-Prince-William-County-Va.-Police.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/immigration/2016/04/26/grassley-sessions-blast-appeals-court-opening-immigration-benefits-habitual-drunkards/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Grassley, Sessions Blast Appeals Court for Opening Immigration Benefits to \u2018Habitual Drunkards\u2019", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/04/carlos-martinelly-montano-Prince-William-County-Va.-Police.jpg", "title": "Grassley, Sessions Blast Appeals Court for Opening Immigration Benefits to \u2018Habitual Drunkards\u2019 - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Chuck Grassley, habitual drunkard, immigration, Jeff Sessions, loretta lynch,Big Government, Immigration, Law Enforcement,illegal alien", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "loretta lynch", "published_time": "2016-04-26T16:02:41-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,Immigration,Law Enforcement"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd38b0\"", "article_summary": "According to Grassley and Sessions, not only does the Court\u2019s holding smack of judicial activism but is places the nation\u2019s communities at risk.\nGrassley and Sessions pressed Lynch and the Justice Department to defend the statute and explain to them by May 6 how it plans to move forward with the case.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERLast month the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals struck down the long-held statute, passed by Congress, rejecting aliens who are \u201chabitual drunkards\u201d from being defined as a person of \u201cgood moral character\u201d when considering the alien for immigration benefits.\nThe court specifically held that since alcoholism is a disease it does not have bearing on a person\u2019s character.\n\u201cThere is a rational basis to deny immigration benefits to habitual drunkards, as distinguished from alcoholics who do not drink, in light of their manifest threat to public health and safety,\u201d the lawmakers wrote in their letter to Lynch."}
