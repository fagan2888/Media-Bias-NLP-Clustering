Taking a “fearful and self-absorbed” Europe to task in a speech before the European Parliament in Strasbourg on Tuesday, Pope Francis called on continental leaders to display compassion to migrants fleeing turbulent countries.

Saying that the 28-nation European Union confronted “growing mistrust” from the public, the pontiff charged that many people see the EU as “aloof, engaged in laying down rules perceived as insensitive to individual peoples, if not downright harmful.” He urged leaders to address poverty and unemployment, denouncing a “globalization of indifference” that he charged wreaks havoc on disadvantaged peoples, particularly immigrants.

Referring to migrants from Africa who have perished in makeshift boats as they attempt to cross the Mediterranean into Europe, Francis said such immigrants need “acceptance and assistance.”
