She stopped at historically black congregations Greater Allen A.M.E. in Jamaica, Mount Moriah AME Church in Cambria Heights and New Greater Bethel Ministries in Queens Village.\n\nClinton was the only presidential candidate in Southeast Queens this week, though she wasn\u2019t the only one trying to win votes in the newly contested and competitive New York State Primary.\n\nBernie Sanders hit LaGuardia Community College with a rally on Sunday and Heidi Cruz, wife of Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), made a visit to Terrace on the Park in Flushing on Monday night and former President Bill Clinton came to Queens Crossing in Flushing on Tuesday morning to push his wife\u2019s agenda. Ohio Governor John Kasich came to Howard Beach last month, while Queens native Donald Trump kept his campaigning upstate and on Long Island.\n\nHillary Clinton\u2019s first church visit was at the Greater Allen AME Cathedral. With over 23,000 members and budget of $34 million for the church and its subsidiary corporations, which include a school and commercial and residential developments, Greater Allen AME it is one of the strongest institutions in Southeast Queens and one of the most influential churches in America.\n\nWith clear voices ringing from the choir and the notes of the organ reverberating through the giant space, Clinton walked in through a side door near the front of the church and stood in a front pew as the music kept playing. A small ripple of energy made its way through the crowd as people noticed her. She swayed from side to side and double-clapped along to the music until the end of the song.\n\nRev. Floyd Flake, who served as a congressman for 11 years, introduced her by recounting the story of how they first met in her kitchen 25 years ago, when former president Bill Clinton was campaigning.\n\n\u201cShe cooked some cookies for us, I think some lemonade or something, I don\u2019t remember everything,\u201d he said to laughter. \u201cIt was a wonderful experience just meeting them then and we\u2019ve been friends ever since.\u201d\n\nHe said he felt justified for bringing a political figure into the church because Bill Clinton had a positive impact in Southeast Queens while he was in office.\n\n\u201cSome people would say, why would you have her come into the church? But I\u2019ll tell you, our congressman\u2019s here, and I think he will attest to the fact, that without Bill Clinton, we would not have the facilities that we have in this community,\u201d Flake said.\n\nClinton picked up on the familiar theme when she took the microphone.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s true, he was in my kitchen. All those years ago. Eatin\u2019 cookies, drinkin\u2019 lemonade, talkin\u2019 about the future,\u201d she said.\n\nShe also called the church by its shorthand name.\n\n\u201cIt is such a great privilege to be back here at Allen,\u201d Clinton said, before moving on to campaign issues around the economy, criminal justice reform and gun violence.\n\n\u201cIf you work hard and you do your part, you should be able to get ahead and stay ahead, and bring your family with you, and lift them up and provide for the next generation,\u201d Clinton said. She said she wanted to work on increasing wage growth and the number of good-quality jobs.\n\n\u201cI know some people are just heartsick over the criminal justice system and incarceration and what it has done to so many families,\u201d Clinton said.\n\nBut while talking about change, Clinton also made a point to praise President Barack Obama, for whom she served as Secretary of State. She framed her campaign for presidency as a way to continue his legacy.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think President Obama gets the credit he deserves for saving our economy, for passing the Affordable Care Act, which has gotten insurance to 12 million Americans, and doing so much else that has been good and right for America,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to build on that progress.\u201d\n\nWith Bill Clinton\u2019s time in office often remembered as an age of prosperity, Clinton also said she would use the \u201clessons\u201d from his presidency if elected.\n\nClinton spent about 20 minutes in each church. By the time she got to her last stop, Bethel Ministries, her energy was substantially higher than it had been at Greater Allen and she\u2019d gone from pondering and storytelling to a more enthusiastic, proselytizing style.\n\nBethel Ministries in Queens Village surged with positive energy for the Clinton campaign after their mass Sunday morning as both their pastor Dr. John H. Boyd II and U.S. Rep Gregory Meeks (D-Jamaica) touted the presidential-hopeful\u2019s hard work for the Black community.\n\nAfter years of economic downturn in the country, Boyd said, \u201cBecause of grace and mercy and great leadership, we have survived.\u201d He noted that recently someone said to \u201cWe need a political revolution in this country.\u201d Boyd contested, \u201cThat political revolution started in 2008 when we elected the first Afro-American President Barack Obama.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think someone was taking a nap with Rip Van Winkle. The revolution has already started and this revolution will continue,\u201d said Boyd.\n\nHe noted that he was happy with the pace growth of economy and jobs in the U.S. ending his appraisal with, \u201cAnd the revolution continues\u2026\u201d He continued to praise the current administration for the Affordable Care Act, lower income taxes, lower gas prices, better fuel efficiency, ending each praise with, \u201cAnd the revolution,\u201d then holding out the microphone for his parishioners to yell ecstatically \u201cContinues!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat revolution is over,\u201d Boyd said, \u201cIt\u2019s time to start another. This morning we are here to pass the torch to a woman who is completely able to carry us with the Lord\u2019s help to victory.\n\n\u201cWe are not a country that is going to be great, we are a great America.\u201d\n\nMeeks said, \u201cAll of us have a part in this history. Someday someone is going to ask you, \u2018What was your role in continuing this revolution?\u2019\u201d\n\nHe believes Secretary Clinton has been, \u201cConsistent and persistent,\u201d in fighting for what she believes in. He said when President Bill Clinton was elected, \u201cFirst thing she did when she got in there was try to make sure everyone had health care.\u201d\n\nMeeks said as a member of the New York delegation, and when she was a U.S. Senator representing New York, Clinton came to meetings with ideas on how to get implement better gun control and how to make sure voters got to the polls.\n\n\u201cThey know she gets things done. They know she breaks glass ceilings. She will continue the revolution,\u201d said Meeks.\n\nClinton walked out to outrageous applause and told the congregation, \u201cCongressman Meeks and Dr. Boyd are right. We must continue the progress. We must make sure that nothing or no one holds us back or sets us against each other.\u201d\n\nShe said as a young girl she never dreamed she would have the opportunities she did. She noted that she worked for the Children\u2019s Defense Fund right out of law school. She went to Alabama \u201cto end the scourge of segregated academies.\u201d She said she also went to North Carolina to get children out of adult jails, \u201cWhere they never belonged in the first place.\u201d\n\nShe said she worked to get children with disabilities into schools, was involved in helping the first African American woman to pass the bar in Mississippi and with Martin Luther King Jr. during the Civil Rights Movement. She said she has demonstrated, \u201cA commitment to issues about how we live and work together is rooted deep within my experience and my heart.\u201d\n\nClinton touted her husband\u2019s presidency as one that was committed to Americans \u201cGetting ahead and staying ahead.\u201d She noted that 23 million jobs were created and income rose for all, not just the wealthy, during that time. African-American median income rose 33 percent, she claimed. \u201cWe were on the right track. Then something interrupted it, a Republican president, who set about to dismantle everything that had been done in eight years,\u201d said Clinton.\n\nShe said Obama inherited the worse financial crisis since the Great Depression. \u201cIt\u2019s worse than they told us,\u201d she said Obama reported. Clinton told the story of how she joined the Obama Administration. During a walk with her husband, in a forest near their Westchester County home, his phone rang, it was Obama and he wanted to speak with Hillary. President Clinton asked if they could call him back when they got home. \u201cI didn\u2019t know it yet, but he was going to ask me to be Secretary of State.\u201d\n\nRegarding the Obama\u2019s landmark legislation, the Affordable Care Act, Clinton said, \u201cI want to make it absolutely clear, I will work to defend it. What works and how to make it better, that\u2019s how you learn. We finally got it done under Barack Obama, it is worth continuing that revolution.\u201d\n\nOther issues she used as a touchstone were early childhood education, making college affordable for the middle-class and paying down student debt, and gun control.\n\n\u201cAnd yes I will take on the gun lobby, cause the number one cause of death for young African-American men, more than the next nine causes combined is gun violence. We have to work together to divert young people from thinking guns are the answer to anything.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, Bill Clinton visited Flushing\u2019s Queens Crossing to talk to a primarily Chinese and Korean American crowd.\n\nIntroduced by Olympian Michelle Kwan, Congresswoman Grace Meng (D-Flushing) and Assemblyman Ron Kim (D-Flushing), Clinton went into extensive detail about his wife\u2019s platform, with a special focus on issues affecting the Asian American Pacific Islander community.\n\nHe touted Clinton\u2019s policy idea of having college debt be reduced to ten percent of after-tax income, so that graduates wouldn\u2019t be weighed down by debt or have to make career choices based solely on income.\n\nHe also said the plan would make help graduates to have better credit scores and make it easier for them to take out business loans. Bill Clinton bragged that his wife had doubled the number of small business loans to women and minorities in her time as a U.S. Senator.\n\nHe said Clinton would also offer immigrant families a path to full citizenship and implement Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals and Parents of Immigrants to prevent mixed-status families from being broken up. He also said Clinton would work to shorten decades-long waiting lists for family visas.\n\nHe also criticized Trump\u2019s idea of walls and banning Muslims, saying that terrorism could not be stopped through physical barriers but that the U.S. government needed to wage the battle in part through social media, where many radicals are recruited.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hillary Clinton made surprise visits to three churches in Jamaica on Sunday to ask for the support of congregants there in the upcoming April 19th Democratic", "generator": "Powered by Slider Revolution 5.1.4 - responsive, Mobile-Friendly Slider Plugin for WordPress with comfortable drag and drop interface.", "og": {"site_name": "Queens Tribune", "description": "Hillary Clinton made surprise visits to three churches in Jamaica on Sunday to ask for the support of congregants there in the upcoming April 19th Democratic primary", "title": "Campaign 2016: Pres.
