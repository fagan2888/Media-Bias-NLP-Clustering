He was eventually shot and killed by a SWAT sniper after a 12-hour standoff. His mother, Jeannine Hammond, says the police \u201chandled the situation very badly.\u201d She also wondered why police didn\u2019t seek medical attention for her son. Boulware said his van was rigged with explosives. In all, she wondered why police killed her son who shot at Dallas Police HQ and planted pipe bombs outside the building. Frankly, it\u2019s a puzzling, puzzling question (via Dallas Morning News):\n\nShe also urged the release of all audio recordings and other public records related to the rampage.\n\n\u201cThe police appear to be heroes,\u201d she wrote, \u201cwhen I think they handled the situation very badly by killing a wounded person who probably would have surrendered and then burning the evidence by detonating the van.\u201d\n\nThough the Police Department declined to comment, law enforcement experts challenged Hammond\u2019s criticism, saying police followed protocol.\n\n\u201cIt was completely justified, what the police did,\u201d said Keith Wenzel, a former Dallas police trainer. \u201cThey followed policy, quite frankly, to a T.\u201d\n\nHammond wrote that police may have felt they \u201cneeded to kill a white suspect to prove that they weren\u2019t playing favorites, since there have been so many black men shot by police lately.\u201d\n\n\u2026\n\nAfter the 12:30 a.m. attack on the Jack Evans Police Headquarters on South Lamar Street, SWAT team members called Boulware\u2019s cellphone and began trying to talk him out of the vehicle. During the conversation, Boulware identified himself and said he had attacked the police headquarters because officers took his child and called him a terrorist.\n\nHe also told police the vehicle was rigged to explode \u2014 a threat that became credible after police discovered a bag with pipe bombs at police headquarters.\n\nAfter more than four hours, SWAT team members believed negotiations with Boulware were deteriorating.\n\n\u201cIt is very unfortunate that Mr. Boulware has put his family in this situation,\u201d said Frederick Frazier, vice president of the Dallas Police Association. \u201cBut it\u2019s the harsh reality that Mr. Boulware made his own decisions that caused the police to react to this situation in the safest way possible, and unfortunately that was to stop him at all costs.\u201d\n\nPolice officials have not provided a detailed timeline because their investigation of the incident remains open.\n\nThey have said they think Boulware died around 4:45 a.m. when a sniper shot a .50-caliber rifle at the van. But because of the bomb threat, officers didn\u2019t approach the vehicle until hours later\n\n\u2026\n\nHammond was more critical of police Sunday than she had been previously. After the shooting, she apologized to police for her son\u2019s actions. She also said she slept with a gun because she was afraid of her son and his deteriorating mental illness.\n\n\u201cI felt I had to write this because something\u2019s wrong with this entire scenario,\u201d Hammond wrote Sunday. \u201cIt happened the very day the Texas governor was to sign open carry here in Texas and two days before Jade Helm 15 was to begin,\u201d she wrote, referring to military exercise planned in Texas.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Wow..05/26/2016 4:06:31AM EST.", "author": "Matt Vespa", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Wow.", "title": "Matt Vespa - Police Should Have 'Tried Harder Not To' Kill My Son Even Though He Shot At Their HQ And Planted Bombs", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2015/06/22/why-did-police-officers-kill-my-son-who-shot-your-hq-and-planted-bombs-outside-of-it-n2015820", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/166/892dad35-1aa6-47be-be8e-525869ea57fd.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Wow.", "title": "Matt Vespa - Police Should Have 'Tried Harder Not To' Kill My Son Even Though He Shot At Their HQ And Planted Bombs", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2015/06/22/why-did-police-officers-kill-my-son-who-shot-your-hq-and-planted-bombs-outside-of-it-n2015820", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/166/892dad35-1aa6-47be-be8e-525869ea57fd.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Police Should Have 'Tried Harder Not To' Kill My Son Even Though He Shot At Their HQ And Planted Bombs, Matt Vespa, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0635\"", "article_summary": "In all, she wondered why police killed her son who shot at Dallas Police HQ and planted pipe bombs outside the building.\nJames Boulware decided to open fire at the police headquarters in Dallas, Texas on June 13.\nThey have said they think Boulware died around 4:45 a.m. when a sniper shot a .50-caliber rifle at the van.\nHis mother, Jeannine Hammond, says the police \u201chandled the situation very badly.\u201d She also wondered why police didn\u2019t seek medical attention for her son.\nShe also said she slept with a gun because she was afraid of her son and his deteriorating mental illness."}
