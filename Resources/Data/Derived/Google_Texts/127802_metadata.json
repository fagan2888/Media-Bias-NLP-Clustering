His up-and-down golf career left him with more low moments than high ones. This summer he has reached the peak of his roller coaster.\n\nThe Scottish golfer went from losing his Web.com Tour card to finishing tied for 27th at the U.S. Open last month, and now he is the HealthOne Colorado Open champion.\n\n\u201cThis is probably the biggest win of my career,\u201d Gunn said. \u201cPlaying under pressure and being able to win gives you great confidence.\u201d\n\nGunn, 35, took a nontraditional route. He grew up in Dornoch, Scotland, and didn\u2019t move to the U.S. until he was 27.\n\nAs a 4-year-old, Gunn became enamored with the game mastered by his late grandfather, who was an 11-time Dornoch club champion.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019d be awfully proud, and if it wasn\u2019t for him I wouldn\u2019t be here now,\u201d Gunn said.\n\nHis childhood centered on following his grandfather\u2019s path. But when golf didn\u2019t earn him a job, he headed to the oil rigs, where he worked for two years, and then began building houses with his father when he turned 18.\n\nGunn wasn\u2019t happy being vaunted into a career of physical labor. He still had a dream of playing golf, and caddying was his way in. He spent seven years manning other golfers\u2019 bags at Royal Dornoch. In 2007 he took a flight to Phoenix and turned pro.\n\nHe almost went back to his old roots by caddying for himself at the Colorado Open, before a late pro bono offer by PGA Tour golfer Keegan Bradley\u2019s caddie, Kevin \u201cPepsi\u201d Hale, saved the day.\n\nGunn began the final day of the tournament two strokes off the lead, but by the back nine he was in a virtual two-man playoff with CSU alum Zahkai Brown, who won the event in 2013.\n\nThe script was set up for Gunn to fail in his first Colorado Open appearance, but every time Brown got closer, Gunn made another drive, chip or putt to halt the rally.\n\nOn the back nine, he made two eagles in three holes, in just 22 minutes. He held a two-stroke lead heading into 18, and when Brown missed his 15-foot birdie putt, Gunn smiled. The winning score, 19-under, was the second-lowest total since the tournament moved to Green Valley Ranch Golf Club.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re the tournament where legends begin,\u201d said Kevin Laura, CEO of the Colorado Golf Foundation. \u201cWe always tell our champions, we prefer them not to come back next year because that means they moved up to Web.com or maybe the PGA Tour.\u201d\n\nGunn has already made waves on golf\u2019s top tour this year. He qualified as an alternate for the U.S. Open and after a few players dropped out, he was in.\n\nGunn didn\u2019t let the opportunity go to waste and did what Tiger Woods, Rickie Fowler and Bubba Watson couldn\u2019t \u2014 make the cut.\n\n\u201cPlaying in the U.S. Open and playing great on the weekend gives you the belief you belong anywhere,\u201d Gunn said.\n\nHe\u2019s always been a confident player, but after finishing 112th on the Web.com money list and being unable to retain his tour card, he began to question his game.\n\nNow, he hopes to regain his Web.com card for next year and go overseas to play on the European Tour.\n\nCameron Wolfe: 303-954-1891, cwolfe@denverpost.com or twitter.com/CameronWolfe\n\nHealthOne Colorado Open\n\nAt Green Valley Ranch Golf Club\n\n7,301 yards; par 72\u2014288\n\nFinal\n\nJimmy Gunn, $23,000 69-69-66-65\u2014269\n\nZahkai Brown, $13,500 65-70-67-68\u2014270\n\nIan Davis, $8,300 69-64-69-71\u2014273\n\nBrad Gehl, $5,051 68-69-72-65\u2014274\n\nChris Ward, $5,051 67-70-69-68\u2014274\n\nNathan Lashley, $5,051 71-66-68-69\u2014274\n\nKurt Kitayama, $4,050 66-69-70-70\u2014275\n\nDerek Tolan, $4,050 69-70-67-69\u2014275\n\nWil Collins, $3,600 70-65-71-70\u2014276\n\nJohn Hurley, $3,150 69-66-74-68\u2014277\n\nShane Bertsch, $3,150 70-69-70-68\u2014277\n\nGeoff Keffer, $2,600 73-68-69-68\u2014278\n\nJoshua Creel, $2,600 69-70-70-69\u2014278", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Jimmy Gunn gets \u201cbiggest win\u201d with help from two back-nine eagles", "title": "Jimmy Gunn gets \u201cbiggest win\u201d with help from two back-nine eagles", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/07/26/jimmy-gunn-gets-biggest-win-with-help-from-two-back-nine-eagles/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150726__glf-openp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150726__glf-openp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-26T22:15:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T18:21:22+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "He still had a dream of playing golf, and caddying was his way in.\nThe Scottish golfer went from losing his Web.com Tour card to finishing tied for 27th at the U.S. Open last month, and now he is the HealthOne Colorado Open champion.\n\u201cPlaying in the U.S. Open and playing great on the weekend gives you the belief you belong anywhere,\u201d Gunn said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re the tournament where legends begin,\u201d said Kevin Laura, CEO of the Colorado Golf Foundation.\nAs a 4-year-old, Gunn became enamored with the game mastered by his late grandfather, who was an 11-time Dornoch club champion."}
