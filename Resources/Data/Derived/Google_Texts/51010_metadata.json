The CIA declined any comment on the matter.\n\nGermany's response\n\nUnsurprisingly, German Chancellor Angela Merkel is not pleased. \"If the allegations are true, it would be for me a clear contradiction as to what I consider to be trusting cooperation between agencies and partners,\" she said while at a meeting in China today.\n\nDe Maiziere suggested that Germany should spy on the U.S. in return.\n\nA BBC analyst explains that frustration with America is multipartisan in German politics:\n\n\"Outrage\" runs across the political spectrum - it's not just a \"chattering class\" issue. Wolfgang Bosbach, for example, who is the Christian Democrat [centre-right] head of the Bundestag committee which oversees interior affairs, questioned whether the US and Germany could be considered as \"partners\" any more.\n\nA top opposition parliamentarian called it \"one of the worst intelligence scandals in Germany in recent decades.\"\n\nU.S.-German relations have already been notably strained by American espionage in the last year. Merkel's own cellphone was tapped by National Security Agency (NSA) last year. Additional NSA leaks from this weekend indicate that the NSA is closely monitoring computer servers in Germany.\n\nObama administration mum so far\n\nGermany summoned the U.S. ambassador on Friday for \"swift clarification\" of what's going on. So far, though, no one in the Obama administration is talking.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Josh Earnest insisted that the president is \"committed to making sure that we resolve this issue with the Germans appropriately,\" but Earnest wouldn't acknowledge if the allegations are true.\n\nObama and Merkel spoke over the phone on Thursday, but the Associated Press reports that \"Obama was not aware of the spying allegations at the time, according to [an unnamed] official,\" so the topic wasn't discussed.\n\nU.S. and Germany work (and spy) together\n\nAlthough the revelation is a shock, one has to wonder how much German officials are posturing. After all, German and American media alike have long highlighted that the two governments collude on matters of espionage.\n\nThe Washington Post explains that \"in recent months, Merkel has sought to lower tensions and German officials have acknowledged that their hopes to win a non-spying agreement with the United States is dead in the water \u2014 largely because Washington fears such a deal would set an unwelcome precedent among allies and rivals alike.\"\n\nGiven current geopolitical circumstances, Germany cannot help but continue to work with U.S., though.\n\n\"When you have a dramatic crisis in Ukraine and the Middle East is going nuts, having no U.S.-German relationship is not an option,\" Ulrike Guerot, a Berlin-based political analyst and commentator told the Post. \"But depending on what happens next, and the details of [this case], the governments need to recast the relationship.\"", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://reason.com/24-7/2014/07/07/us-german-double-agent-scandal-worst-in", "type": "article", "site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "An unnamed 31-year-old man within Germany's Federal Intelligence Service (BND) was arrested last week on suspicion of handing over secrets to the U.S.", "title": "U.S.-German Double Agent Scandal 'Worst in Decades'"}, "twitter": {"title": "U.S.-German Double Agent Scandal 'Worst in Decades'", "description": "An unnamed 31-year-old man\nwithin Germany's Federal Intelligence Service (BND) was arrested\nlast week on suspicion of handing over secrets to the U.S.\ngovernment.\nThe German publication Deutsche Welle \nreports&nbsp;that the nation's \"federal prosecutor confirmed\n[on Thursday] that he had been arrested on the 'strong suspicion'\nof spying activities.\"\nWhat was this alleged double agent spying on? \"The suspect\nreportedly told investigators that he had gathered information on\nan investigative committee from Germany's lower house of\npa", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@reason247"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "article": {"tag": "Germany", "published_time": "2014-07-07T21:36:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/zenon-evans"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd70c\"", "article_summary": "\"The panel is conducting an inquiry into NSA surveillance on German officials and citizens.\"\nU.S. and Germany work (and spy) togetherAlthough the revelation is a shock, one has to wonder how much German officials are posturing.\nA top opposition parliamentarian called it \"one of the worst intelligence scandals in Germany in recent decades.\"\nWhat was this alleged double agent spying on?\nGerman Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere claims that the spy sold 218 secret documents for 25,000 euros."}
