CR’s take: We agree that women have the right to know about their breast health, but we think they should also know the limitations of ultrasound and other tests. They may make most sense for women with “extremely dense” breasts, who might have about twice the risk of breast cancer compared with women with average density. In general, we agree with the Task Force that women ages 50 to 74 should have mammograms every two years. We think women in their 40s and those 75 and older should talk with their doctor to see whether the benefits outweigh the potential harm for them.
