College, has spent the past three seasons playing for the Lake Erie Monsters. Now his bio can include that defenseman Stollery played his first NHL game Saturday for the Avalanche at age 26.\n\nAnd according to Avs coach Patrick Roy, Stollery played pretty well.\n\n\u201cFor his first NHL game, I thought he did a lot of good things,\u201d Roy said. \u201cHe kept his game very simple. I was happy to see him play. He was great in training camp, and I was just happy to see him play his first NHL game.\u201d\n\nStollery had a plus-1 rating in his debut, playing 17 shifts and 10:55 overall. He was called for a hooking minor on the Minnesota Wild\u2019s Dany Heatley in the second period, but it was a dubious call. Replays showed Heatley grabbing the stick and pulling it to his body.\n\nChances are Stollery will quickly be back in the minors or on the bench with the Avalanche, because Nick Holden, Nate Guenin and Tyson Barrie all could be back soon. But you never know with Roy, who favors playing guys as long as the team is winning. He has a soft spot for longshots such as Stollery.\n\n\u201cDefinitely some butterflies there,\u201d Stollery, a left-handed shooter, said of making his NHL debut. \u201cBut once the game got going, it just felt like another hockey game. It was pretty short notice, so I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve had time to let it hit me yet.\u201d\n\nStollery was in Rockford, Ill., where the Monsters had just played, when coach Dean Chynoweth told him to get on a plane to Minnesota because he had been called up by the Avalanche.\n\n\u201cIt was out of the blue. I didn\u2019t follow the Colorado game (Friday), obviously, so I didn\u2019t know anything had gone on,\u201d Stollery said. \u201cI was just excited. It\u2019s definitely taken longer for me, going the college route and then in the minors. But I\u2019ve always felt that I can make it, and just to get this first game is an incredible feeling.\u201d\n\nStastny update. The Avalanche had Sunday off and will practice Monday in Chicago, where an update on Paul Stastny will be announced. Stastny didn\u2019t play in the third period Saturday because of a leg injury. Roy said after the game he didn\u2019t think the injury was serious and that Stastny would play Tuesday against the Blackhawks.\n\nAdrian Dater: adater@denverpost.com or twitter.com/adater", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Karl Stollery makes most of chance in first NHL game for Avalanche", "title": "Karl Stollery makes most of chance in first NHL game for Avalanche", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/01/12/karl-stollery-makes-most-of-chance-in-first-nhl-game-for-avalanche/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140112_112945_Karl-Stollery.jpg", "height": 450}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140112_112945_Karl-Stollery.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-12T21:24:53+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T06:22:06+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcea3\"", "article_summary": "Now his bio can include that defenseman Stollery played his first NHL game Saturday for the Avalanche at age 26.\nAnd according to Avs coach Patrick Roy, Stollery played pretty well.\nStastny didn\u2019t play in the third period Saturday because of a leg injury.\n\u201cFor his first NHL game, I thought he did a lot of good things,\u201d Roy said.\nRoy said after the game he didn\u2019t think the injury was serious and that Stastny would play Tuesday against the Blackhawks."}
