A Turkish intelligence official says authorities believe the common law wife of one of the gunmen behind the attacks in France came through Turkey days before and may have crossed into Syria.

The official told The Associated Press on Saturday a woman by the same name of the common law wife of Amedy Coulibaly flew to Istanbul on Jan. 2.

The official said the woman resembled a widely distributed photo of the woman, Hayat Boumeddiene. The official said she landed at Sabiha Gokcen, which is Istanbul's secondary airport, stayed two nights in Istanbul before traveling to Sanliurfa near the border with Syria and "then disappeared."

He spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to speak on the record.
