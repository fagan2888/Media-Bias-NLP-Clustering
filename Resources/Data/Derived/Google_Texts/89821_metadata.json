Intervention agencies designed to stop the highly traditional cutting practice have been largely focused on identifying communities, but new research conducted at the University of Zurich in Sudan reveals female genital mutilation is less of a social norm and more of a family tradition. The findings, published in the journal Science, are likely to influence the direction of future prevention programs.\n\nFor the study, researchers first focused on communities in Sudan, where prevalence rates are among the highest. They tracked which girls were victims of genital mutilation by following an observable sign: Henna markings are often applied to a girl\u2019s feet when she is cut; some are cut as young as infanthood. They discovered a pattern; communities were no longer practicing it to fit in with other community members, but instead, they were cutting their girls based on personal values. The researchers described these practices as becoming heterogeneous, meaning they varied from family to family.\n\n\"We found that cutting and non-cutting families essentially live door-to-door,\u201d said the study\u2019s co-author Charles Efferson, a researcher at Zurich University, in a press release. \u201cThe tremendous heterogeneity we observed suggests that coordination is not that important. Even if it plays some role, families apparently also respond to other private concerns and values that vary a lot across families and individuals.\"\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization, female genital mutilation involves intentionally altering or causing injury to a girl\u2019s genitals for no medical reason or health benefits. It was put into practice to control and suppress a woman\u2019s sexuality and ensure virginity before marriage. Complications are common considering the procedures aren\u2019t typically performed by a doctor or health care professional. In only 18 percent of the cases does a health care provider carry out the mutilation. Oftentimes, this results in severe bleeding, problems urinating, later infections, cysts, infertility, problems during childhood, and an increased risk of newborn deaths.\n\nAttitudes toward female genital mutilation can differ tremendously from one family to another, which makes it a difficult problem to tackle. However, the study\u2019s findings suggest if families against the practice are used to convince other families within their community to abandon the practice, their daughters would have a better chance of growing up healthy.\n\n\"Because there's so much individual heterogeneity, public declarations run the risk of simply collecting the families already inclined to abandon cutting,\u201d the study\u2019s lead author Sonja Vogt said in a press release. \u201cA declaration could then have little or no effect on the remaining families in a community because these families value cutting for reasons unrelated to coordination.\"\n\nSource: Vogt S and Efferson C.
