Some experts believe Obama possesses this authority, although Republicans in Congress will almost certainly dispute that.\n\nExactly what Obama plans to do is a closely held secret. But following the meeting with the activists, Obama declared his intention to use his executive authority to reform parts of a broken immigration system that has cleaved families and hobbled the economy. After being informed by Speaker John Boehner that the Republican-controlled House would not vote on a comprehensive overhaul of U.S. immigration law this year, the President announced in a fiery speech that he was preparing \u201cto do what Congress refuses to do, and fix as much of our immigration system as we can.\u201d Obama has been cautious about preempting Congress. But its failure to act has changed his thinking. The recent meeting \u201cwas really the first time we had heard from the administration that they are looking at\u201d expanding a program to provide temporary relief from deportations and work authorization for undocumented immigrants, says Marielena Hincapi\u00e9, executive director of the National Immigration Law Center. The White House won\u2019t comment on how many undocumented immigrants could be affected. \u201cI don\u2019t want to put a number on it,\u201d says a senior White House official, who says Obama\u2019s timeline to act before the mid-term elections remains in place. Obama has a broad menu of options at his disposal, but there are two major sets of changes he can order. The first is to provide affirmative relief from deportation to one or more groups of people. Under this mechanism, individuals identified as \u201clow-priority\u201d threats can come forward to seek temporary protection from deportation and work authorization. In 2012, the administration created a program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), that allowed eligible young unauthorized immigrants to apply for a two-year reprieve from deportation and a work permit. The most aggressive option in this category would be expanding deferred action to anyone who could have gained legal status under the bipartisan bill that passed the Senate in June 2013. According to a Congressional Budget Office analysis, the Senate bill would have covered up to 8 million undocumented immigrants. It is unlikely that Obama goes that far. But even more modest steps could provide relief to a population numbering in the seven figures. \u201cYou can get to big numbers very quickly,\u201d says Marshall Fitz, director of immigration policy at the Center for American Progress, a progressive think tank.\n\n\"Obama has been cautious about preempting Congress.\" Uh-huh. He was cautious 41 times when he unilaterally altered Obamacare. He was cautious when he unilaterally changed the law to allow hundreds of thousands of DREAMers legal status. He was cautious when he unilaterally halted most deportations. He was cautious when he ordered the Justice Department not to enforce DOMA. He was cautious when he made illegal recess appointments to the NLRB.\n\nI don't think Time has the same definition of \"cautious\" as you and I do.\n\nRep. Gutierrez believes that the number will be about 5 million. It will almost certainly include agricultural workers to make the Chamber of Commerce happy. Others on the list to be amnestied include family members of DREAMers already made legal by Obama's other executive order.\n\nDoes anyone believe that this \"temporary legal status\" will actually be temporary?\n\nNo comment yet from the 1.5 million people waiting in other countries who are seeking to come to the US legally.", "article_metadata": {"page-title": "Up to 5 Million Illegals to be Granted 'Temporary Legal Status' | PJ Media", "title": "Up to 5 Million Illegals to be Granted 'Temporary Legal Status' | PJ Media", "og": {"site_name": "PJ Media", "description": "Work authorizations and no deportations for millions of illegal aliens.", "title": "Up to 5 Million Illegals to be Granted 'Temporary Legal Status'", "url": "https://pjmedia.com/blog/up-to-5-million-illegals-to-be-granted-temporary-legal-status/", "image": "https://pajamasmed.hs.llnwd.net/e1/user-content/31/files/2014/07/0000011.jpg", "updated_time": 1464139243, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Work authorizations and no deportations for millions of illegal aliens.", "title": "Up to 5 Million Illegals to be Granted 'Temporary Legal Status'", "url": "https://pjmedia.com/blog/up-to-5-million-illegals-to-be-granted-temporary-legal-status/", "image": "https://pajamasmed.hs.llnwd.net/e1/user-content/31/files/2014/07/0000011.jpg", "site": "@PJMedia_com", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "pinterest": "nopin", "pinterestDescription": "Up to 5 Million Illegals to be Granted 'Temporary Legal Status'", "fb": {"app_id": 149848758413844}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdbb5\"", "article_summary": "Up to 5 Million Illegals to be Granted 'Temporary Legal Status'President Obama is preparing executive orders that would grant up to 5 million illegal aliens temporary legal status, giving them the ability to work in the US.\nDoes anyone believe that this \"temporary legal status\" will actually be temporary?\nHe was cautious when he unilaterally changed the law to allow hundreds of thousands of DREAMers legal status.\nThe most aggressive option in this category would be expanding deferred action to anyone who could have gained legal status under the bipartisan bill that passed the Senate in June 2013.\nAccording to a Congressional Budget Office analysis, the Senate bill would have covered up to 8 million undocumented immigrants."}
