A recent report by Frost & Sullivan predicts the AI market in healthcare will reach $6 billion by 2021, up from just $600 million two years ago.\n\nWith the shift to a value-based reimbursement model, ushered in with the Affordable Care Act, hospitals and providers are looking for new ways to increase efficiencies and improve patient outcomes. Cognitive solutions such as IBM\u2019s Watson system can assess huge amounts of patient data, provide guidance and decision support, and improve clinical workflow.\n\nThe goal is to support the physician, not replace him or her, said Anil Jain, vice president of IBM\u2019s Watson Health and an internist and medical informatics specialist at the Cleveland Clinic.\n\nWatson is currently partnering with about 30 companies and institutions to create additional levels of specialization for its basic software platform. Here\u2019s a look at some of the ways AI is being used to affect practice management and care services.\n\nDiagnosis and treatment\n\nKeeping up with the latest medical information is not only daunting for today\u2019s care providers\u2014it\u2019s next to impossible. According to Jain, the medical literature and knowledge base that a physician needs to draw upon is literally doubling every two years.\n\nWatson\u2019s AI uses cognitive computing to sift through all that information and find patterns that are relevant for different patients a doctor is seeing in order to help them make stronger diagnoses and craft better treatment regimens. For example, Watson Oncology sifts through thousands of cases and articles and helps the doctor decide the best treatment for a specific type of tumor.\n\nAk\u0113Lex, a startup located in Portland, OR, has developed an adaptive learning tool that helps caregivers deliver care by providing guidance based on the patient\u2019s profile.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like having a specialist watching over a frontline nurse who is treating a patient,\u201d said Venkat Rajan, global director of the Visionary Health Program at Frost & Sullivan.\n\nDisease management\n\nAustin, TX-based Cognitive Scale developed a tool, called Cognitive Clouds, to provide actionable insights for people living with chronic conditions. Doctors use the insights to better understand their patients' needs and tailor care.\n\nThe system is being used by Utah\u2019s Intermountain Healthcare in a pilot program to help teens with Type 1 diabetes transition to self-care as adults. The goal is to reduce future hospitalizations and ensure better outcomes, a Cognitive Scale spokesman said.\n\nIn February, the two-year-old startup teamed with the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center on a multiyear initiative to use cognitive computing to speed up healthcare decisionmaking, enhance the patient experience, and boost staff productivity.\n\nWatson is also being used to look at disease pathways and why certain people might respond better to certain types of care processes better than others. To do this, Watson considers the patient\u2019s personality, as well as all sorts of disparate data, such as socioeconomic data and demographics, to help predict how patients will respond to different treatment options, Jain said.\n\nClinical Trials\n\nOne of the trickiest challenges for doctors is finding an appropriate clinical trial for a patient who has exhausted available treatment options, Jain said. Watson reads through thousands of clinical trial protocols and reasons whether a specific patient might qualify for a particular clinical trial and communicates that back to the doctor.\n\nAk\u0113Lex\u2019s AKE stores unbiased clinical data and allows it to be searched by patient populations, individuals, diseases, conditions, procedures, medications, and more. This gives physicians immediate access to data at various levels depending on the problem they\u2019re trying to solve vis \u00e0 vis their patient.\n\nWellness\n\nUsing Watson\u2019s cognitive capabilities, Welltok\u2019s Caf\u00e9well Concierge app offers personalized health solutions for everyday consumers. The app employs Watson\u2019s natural language processing capabilities to assess user\u2019s activity goals and prompt them to meet those goals.\n\nWatson is also partnering with Johnson & Johnson to use AI to help joint replacement patients better manage their health. It is also partnering with Medtronic with the goal of being able to predict which diabetes patients need more help in keeping their blood sugar under control.\n\nStay informed.\n\nto get the latest healthcare industry news delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nReimbursement\n\nHindsait has developed a software-as-a-service platform that enables payers and accountable care organizations to identify potentially unnecessary services during the review process and improve quality of care. The system uses natural language processing, a database of established clinical guidelines and knowledge base, and predictive analytics \u201cto assign a confidence score that enables consistent clinical and administrative decisionmaking,\u201d CEO of the Hackensack, NJ startup Pinaki Dasgupta said.\n\nHindsait\u2019s platform has been live in production with Magellan Health since last year, Dasgupta said. The AI technology improves Magellan\u2019s utilization management system by bolstering clinical quality and outcomes and increasing the consistency and productivity of care reviewers, he added.\n\nThe technology, which is hosted on the HIPAA-compliant, highly secured Google Cloud platform, is also being piloted by several large payers and ACOs.\n\nThe beauty of cloud-based healthcare AI is not only its potential, but that it\u2019s affordable for most providers\u2014from large tertiary care centers to small medical practices, Jain said.\n\nJain noted, for example, that a hospital in Thailand and one in South America are currently leveraging Watson\u2019s cognitive computing. \u201cThese are hospitals that may not be able to afford having super computers in their data centers, but because of the cloud we\u2019re able to make it significantly more affordable,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Meg Bryant", "twitter": {"domain": "Healthcare Dive", "site": "@healthcaredive", "card": "summary"}, "featured": "True", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/cache/f3/a9/f3a98519a8eb24e8017f4a1d4d1ac75e.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "healthcare,type-newspost,healthcare-health-it,healthcare-practice-mgmt", "news_keywords": "Health IT,Practice Management,Practice Mgmt", "category": "News Post", "sailthru.item_featured": 1, "title": "5 ways artificial intelligence is changing the face of healthcare", "pub_date": "mar 10, 2016", "section": "news", "sailthru.date": "2016-03-10T02:00:00", "content_boost": 5, "touched": "True", "article_date_original": "Thursday, March 10, 2016, 02:00 AM", "medium": "news", "description": "Healthcare", "sailthru.expire_date": "2026-02-26T02:00:00", "teaser": "<p>IBM&#39;s Watson Health is partnering with about 30 companies and institutions to create more specialized uses for its AI platform.</p>", "sponsored": "False", "date": "2016-03-10", "sailthru.description": "IBM's Watson Health is partnering with about 30 companies and institutions to create more specialized uses for its AI platform.", "viewport": "width=986", "og": {"site_name": "Healthcare Dive", "description": "IBM's Watson Health is partnering with about 30 companies and institutions to create more specialized uses for its AI platform.", "title": "5 ways artificial intelligence is changing the face of healthcare", "url": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/news/5-ways-artificial-intelligence-is-changing-the-face-of-healthcare/415424/", "image": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/diveimage/PepperRobot.jpg", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "aN-77CvDv8Rt4OQnHMaUSm6V87TF8ri5GDUv93p7pHk", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/cache/a1/06/a1065369b14f163401dd4d4a5b6fc761.jpg"}, "article_summary": "5 ways artificial intelligence is changing the face of healthcareArtificial intelligence is advancing rapidly and poised to change the status quo in any number of industries, including healthcare.\nThe beauty of cloud-based healthcare AI is not only its potential, but that it\u2019s affordable for most providers\u2014from large tertiary care centers to small medical practices, Jain said.\nAk\u0113Lex\u2019s AKE stores unbiased clinical data and allows it to be searched by patient populations, individuals, diseases, conditions, procedures, medications, and more.\nCognitive solutions such as IBM\u2019s Watson system can assess huge amounts of patient data, provide guidance and decision support, and improve clinical workflow.\nWatson is also partnering with Johnson & Johnson to use AI to help joint replacement patients better manage their health."}
