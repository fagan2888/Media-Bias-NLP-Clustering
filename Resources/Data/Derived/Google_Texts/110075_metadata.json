On Thursday, students finished the 17-day academy on the college campus.\n\nPablo Joucovsky, dean of academics at South High School, helped run the academy with teachers from South and said during the short time, students seemed more responsible and engaged.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable,\u201d Joucovsky said. \u201cThey are incredibly resilient. You give them a way to get more success and they are able to make it happen.\u201d\n\nThe 45 students come from DPS\u2019s newcomer centers, which provide extra support to students who are new to the country, and all are going to South this fall.\n\nThe academy was not required. Of 120 students who were invited, 45 signed up.\n\n\u201cA lot of these kids are very antsy about going to high school or about thinking of college,\u201d Joucovsky said.\n\nNow, students will start high school knowing Joucovsky and other teachers and have an idea of how to get into college so they can stay motivated.\n\nThe DPS part of the academy is meant to sharpen English skills through English, math and advisory classes.\n\nStudents in one math class last week not only found equivalent fractions, but had to write a paragraph about how they found their answer. Then they traded notebooks to edit each others\u2019 work.\n\nIn the last week of the academy, most students easily wrote a paragraph in less than a minute.\n\nFridays during the academy, DU professors and staff gave students a taste of college life \u2014 touring campus, taking a science class from a university professor, and meeting alumni who shared their experiences as first- generation college students, or as English learners.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily a recruitment tool,\u201d said Adrienne Martinez, assistant director for student access and success programs at DU. \u201cBut the more familiar they are with a college campus, the more likely they are to go to college and be able to really identify what school is the best fit for them.\u201d\n\nDPS has held summer academies for English learners before, but it\u2019s the first time they partnered with a university. In the future, officials want the academy to last longer, reach more students and track how much of an advantage students really might be getting.\n\n\u201cWe do really believe they\u2019re getting something out of it academically,\u201d said Christine Muldoon, director of English language development programs for DPS. \u201cBut it\u2019s also really about getting them used to that college campus. Letting them know it\u2019s not that scary and they can do it.\u201d\n\nYesenia Robles: 303-954-1372, yrobles@denverpost.com or twitter.com/yeseniarobles", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "New Denver summer school for English learners gets a college focus", "title": "New Denver summer school for English learners gets a college focus", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/07/02/new-denver-summer-school-for-english-learners-gets-a-college-focus/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150702__20150703_A4_CDXXELAACADEMYp2.jpg", "height": 443}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150702__20150703_A4_CDXXELAACADEMYp2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-02T20:06:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T17:42:28+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Denver Public Schools, K-12 education"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2878\"", "article_summary": "\u201cA lot of these kids are very antsy about going to high school or about thinking of college,\u201d Joucovsky said.\nThe immigrant students from across the world are the first to graduate from Denver Public School\u2019s summer academy hosted with the University of Denver.\nThis summer, 45 soon-to-be ninth-graders in Denver are expected to retain a lot more of what they learned in the last school year.\nThe DPS part of the academy is meant to sharpen English skills through English, math and advisory classes.\nIn the future, officials want the academy to last longer, reach more students and track how much of an advantage students really might be getting."}
