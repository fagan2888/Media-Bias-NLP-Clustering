But inflation isn\u2019t totally quiescent, either.\n\nAs the name implies, the consumer price index measures prices paid by consumers at retail. It measures average prices across the country, and gives each item a weighting in the index in proportion to how much the average consumer spends on each.\n\nInflation that hurt our wallets the most\n\nItem SHARE OF SPENDING ANNUAL INFLATION RATE CONTRIBUTION TO CPI Owners equivalent rent 24.1% 1.5% 0.35 pts Rent of residence 6.6% 2.0% 0.13 pts Food away from home 5.7% 2.3% 0.11 pts Car insurance 2.5% 4.4% 0.11 pts Hospital services 1.6% 6.0% 0.10 pts College tuition 1.8% 4.9% 0.09 pts Tobacco products 0.8% 7.9% 0.07 pts New vehicles 3.1% 1.8% 0.06 pts Meat, poultry, fish, eggs 2.0% 2.5% 0.05 pts Used cars 1.9% 2.1% 0.04 pts Physician services 1.6% 2.5% 0.04 pts\n\nFor instance, shelter costs consume about 32% of the average consumer\u2019s spending, while food takes about 14%, energy 10%, and health care 7%.\n\nEven with such a low inflation rate, prices of most goods and services are up, at least a little, since September 2008. Some prices, notably for energy and high-tech goods, have fallen.\n\n(If you\u2019re one of those who believes, against all evidence, that the CPI is simply a fiction invented by bureaucrats and politicians, or who thinks that the real inflation rate is somewhat closer to 10% per year than 2%, please stop reading right now. I\u2019ve dealt with your \u201ctheories\u201d before. This is the reality-based, non-fiction section of the Internet.\n\nEveryone experiences inflation in their own way, depending on their own spending habits and individual circumstances. Anyone who consumes a lot of medical care, or higher education, has seen a faster inflation rate than average. By contrast, people who drive a lot, or who buy electronics, may have experienced a bit of deflation.\n\nI\u2019ve gone back over the past five years of CPI data (since September 2008) to find out which price changes have hurt consumers\u2019 pocketbooks the most and helped them the most. This isn\u2019t just a matter of seeing which items have seen the largest prices increases, it\u2019s also a matter of how much of each item the typical consumer buys.\n\nA big price decline for something you never buy doesn\u2019t help much, but a drop in something you buy every week, (say, gasoline) does.\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising that increases in shelter prices have hurt consumers the most, given that shelter is by far the largest item in the CPI market basket. Those who rent have seen their costs rise by an average of 2% per year, while those who own a house have seen their shelter costs rise by 1.5% annually.\n\nHigher rent prices have added 0.13 percentage points to the CPI, while owners equivalent rent (home owners\u2019 costs) have contributed 0.35 percentage points. Between the two, they contributed 0.48 points of the annual 1.21 percentage point increase in the CPI\n\nFood prices have also risen modestly over the past five years. The price of buying food to eat outside the home has risen at a 2.3% annual rate, contributing 0.11 points to CPI.\n\nAs for food consumed at home, it\u2019s a mixed picture depending on which aisle of the supermarket you\u2019re shopping in. Meat and poultry prices have risen at a 2.5% annual rate, adding 0.05 points to CPI. But prices of dairy and of fruits and vegetables have barely budged, and they are a relative bargain compared with the rest of the things we purchase.\n\nGenerally speaking, the prices of goods have been rising much slower than the price of services. Goods prices are subject to more global competition, while services are generally produced locally.\n\nSome services are purchased so infrequently that we hardly notice what they cost except when we\u2019re writing that one big check every six months. Car insurance, for instance, has risen at a 4.4% annual rate, but most people don\u2019t shop around. Higher car insurance prices added 0.11 points to CPI.\n\nCollege tuition, hospital services and physician services are also resistant to bargaining, although the inflation rate for these services has also slowed slightly. Hospitals added 0.10 points, and tuition contributed 0.09. Doctors\u2019 bills added 0.04 points.\n\nOn the other hand, everybody drives a hard bargain when they shop for cars. New car prices are up 1.8% annually, and used car prices are up a bit more, 2.1%. Despite those modest increases, however, the typical consumer devotes a fairly large chunk of the monthly budget to the car payment, putting car prices in the top 10 list for most costly. Combined, they added 0.1 point to the CPI.\n\nFinally, tobacco prices have risen at a very rapid pace, up 7.9% every year. That\u2019s mostly due to higher taxes. So even though the typical family spends less than 1% of its budget on tobacco, it added 0.07 points to CPI.\n\nDeflation that helped our wallets the most\n\nItem SHARE OF SPENDING ANNUAL INFLATION RATE CONTRIBUTION TO CPI Gasoline 5.3% -1.9% -0.10 pts Natural gas 0.9% -6.6% -0.05 pts Household furnishings 4.0% -0.7% -0.03 pts Wireless phone service 1.4% -1.9% -0.02 pts Personal computers 0.2% -9.1% -0.02 pts Televisions 0.1% -19.2% -0.02 pts Toys 0.3% -5.8% -0.02 pts Electricity 2.9% -0.1% * Girls' apparel 0.3% -0.6% * Fuel oil 0.2% -0.3% * * Less than 0.01 points\n\nSome prices have fallen, helping consumers stretch their budget.\n\nGasoline prices, which account for more than 5% of the typical budget, have been the biggest help, falling at a 1.9% annual rate and shaving 0.1 points off CPI\n\nNatural gas prices have been the second most helpful, dropping at a 6.6% annual rate and cutting the CPI by 0.05 points. Electricity prices and fuel oil prices are also among the 10 most beneficial deflationary items.\n\nHigh-tech goods are also falling in price, especially taking quality into account, as the Bureau of Labor Statistics does. Television prices have dropped the most, sinking at a 19.2% annual rate and slicing 0.02 points from CPI.\n\nPersonal computers and wireless phone service have also dropped significantly, cutting 0.02 points off the inflation rate.\n\nRounding out the top 10, prices of some other manufactured goods have fallen steadily as cheaper imports gain market share. The cost of furnishing a house, which accounts for 4% of the typical budget, has slipped 0.7% a year, subtracting 0.03 points from inflation. Toy prices have plunged at a 5.8% annual rate, while girls\u2019 apparel prices have fallen at a 0.6% annual rate.\n\nThe impact that inflation has on any family is highly variable, depending upon their spending patterns. And in times of very sluggish wage growth, even the modest inflationary pressures we\u2019re feeling now can put real burdens on families struggling to pay all their bills.\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "description": "Since the financial crisis of 2008, inflation has risen at the slowest pace in 50 years.
