Sit down.\n\nShout out a word that doesn\u2019t really rhyme? Thumbs down from the majority of the group and you sit down, too. (Although, if you say it with confidence, you\u2019ll earn some extra points.)\n\nIt\u2019s \u201cDeath by Poetry,\u201d fast-paced, think-quick-on-your feet fun, with students pausing only when the group breaks out in giggles for a goofy verse.\n\nAnd it\u2019s just the warm-up in Great Brook Middle School\u2018s advanced improv class.\n\nWhen teacher Maryanne V. Cullinan asks for a volunteer to hop in front of his or her peers first there\u2019s no hesitation. This class is loud and chaotic. The students make up the school\u2019s performance improv group, called Recycled Talent.\n\nImprov is one of the school\u2019s most popular classes within the Extended Learning Program, an enrichment program that allows students to sign up for fun classes that meet twice a week during the day.\n\nStudents have to be in good academic standing and receive approval from their teachers to miss class to attend the extended learning classes, something 130 students, or about 40 percent of the school population, do this year.\n\nThis year\u2019s courses include costume design, where students design and sew outfits for the school\u2019s play; Greek mythology; Lego robotics; and Griffins Nest, a program with next-door neighbor Antrim Elementary School that partners middle school mentors with younger students in 1st- through 4th-grade.\n\nThe school gauges students\u2019 interests in subjects with sign-up sheets before deciding which classes to offer each year.\n\nAs the extended learning program teacher, Cullinan said she aims to cast a wide net so as many students as possible can find a class that fits their interests.\n\nShe prepares curriculum for everything she teaches, from the birding class a group of students requested a couple years back to a gaming class she taught last year, and her room reflects her flexibility.\n\nThere are no desks, just some large round tables that are pushed to the side for improv. A handful of computers line one wall, sewing mannequins are crowded together in a corner and shelves are stacked with art supplies and board games.\n\nBack in the improv class, students run a freeze tag exercise, where two people are on stage acting out a skit. When Cullinan yells freeze, a new person jumps up, taps one person out and starts a new skit that the remaining person has to pick up on.\n\nCullinan tells her students that one of the skills that can fade over the summer is the ability to listen, an important job for on-stage performers when the only script they have to follow is what comes out of another person\u2019s mouth.\n\nThe students\u2019 acts are no doubt silly, telling of mean asparagus, fish catching on fire and alpacas kicking zoo visitors.\n\nBut every story has to make some sense and every act should establish a location, relationship and problem that the audience can understand.\n\nStudents said improv has taught them about comedic timing, how to listen and take a measure of an audience\u2019s engagement, how to speak clearly in public and how to work well with a partner.\n\n\u201dIt definitely has more of a purpose than getting out of class and goofing off,\u201d 8th-grader Mya Poluchov of Antrim said.\n\nStudents might come into improv quiet and shy, but when they leave, they\u2019ll have a lot more confidence, 7th-grader Clara Quintanilha of Bennington said.\n\nExtended Learning Program classes are open to students in all grades, so kids make friends across social circles and ages, Cullinan said.\n\nIt can be easy to cast off extracurricular classes as less important than core subjects, but all of the extended learning classes give students the chance to problem-solve, direct their own learning and collaborate with others, Cullinan said. And those are skills they\u2019ll use long after they leave Great Brook.\n\nA Keene State College professor was named a Cedarcrest Champion for his volunteer work with the Keene-based Cedarcrest Center for Children with Disabilities .
