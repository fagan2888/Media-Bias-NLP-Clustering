Research into the use of the marijuana derivative cannabidiol (CBD) is just beginning. In an abstract presented at the American Epilepsy Society 69th Annual Meeting in Philadelphia, PA, a team described their ongoing work. Misty Smith, PhD, a research assistant professor at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, UT, and colleagues are looking at how cannabidiol interacts with traditional anti-seizure drugs.The current project compares the relative anticonvulsant efficacy of CBD with five mechanistically-different ASDs (i.e., carbamazepine (CBZ), valproate (VPA), levetiracetam (LEV), clobazam (CBM), and lacosamide (LAC)). The studies test the hypothesis that CBD will have supra-additive (synergistic) effects when administered in combination with mechanistically-different, yet compatible, ASDs without enhancing adverse events.So far, they have identified "significant synergistic interaction" with LEV at the 1:1 fixed ratio (FR) combination (P<0.01), whereas significant antagonistic interactions have been identified with CBM at the 1:3 FR combination (P<0.05) and at the 1:3 and 3:1 FR combinations with CBZ (P<0.001). Isobolographic studies on the FR combinations of cannabidiol and lacosamide are currently underway. Additional ongoing studies are evaluating the 1:1 FR combination of CBD:LEV in preclinical models of anxiety, depression, and locomotor activity.The team's goal is to gain "a better understanding of the nature of the CBD:ASD interactions." They hope such knowledge may inform polytherapy to optimize therapeutic safety and efficacy of CBD use.
