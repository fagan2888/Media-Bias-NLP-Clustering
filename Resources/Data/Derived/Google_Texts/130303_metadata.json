What they\u2019ve done is disrupt it for the 85% who had healthcare and their costs are going up significantly.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cWe\u2019ve broken the system to help a few. Nobody would fix a problem that way.\u201d\n\nAnother guest, Democrat Rep. Chris Van Hollen pointed out that the bulk of affected people seeing cancellation notices\u2014a number that could rise to more than 10 million according to an NBC News investigation\u2014is less than 5% of Americans who purchase insurance on their own.\n\n\u201cHe just put out so much misinformation in two seconds that I can\u2019t answer,\u201d Van Hollen said after Rogers spoke.\n\n\u201cThe individual market, which has always been broken, represents about 5 percent of the market. A lot of those people were losing their health care on an annual basis before. We\u2019re trying to fix that,\u201d Van Hollen said, before two representatives began talking over them with Rogers alledging that 80 million will see their plans cancelled and Van Hollen shaking his head and saying \u201ccome on, Mike.\u201d\n\nHost David Gregory cut both off, ending the segment.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Republican Rep.
