After all, he noted, at a party this summer celebrating his presidential campaign\u2019s 10-year anniversary, there was a feeling in the room that he should do it all over again.\n\n\u201cOf course people were trying to convince me,\u201d Dean said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see. As I say, you never say never in politics.\u201d\n\nDean added quickly that Clinton would make \u201ca terrific president.\u201d But he also suggested her window for the gig may have closed. \u201cMy own view is that you rarely go back a generation. We\u2019ve passed that generation onto Obama\u2019s generation,\u201d Dean said, who is a year younger than Clinton. \u201cIt\u2019s unusual to go back. It\u2019s only happened once in my political lifetime, which is with Carter to Reagan.\u201d\n\nDean hadn\u2019t read the article in the New Republic that sparked runaway speculation earlier this month about a possible Elizabeth Warren presidential campaign \u2014 headline: \u201cHillary\u2019s Nightmare\u201d \u2014 but he argued that Clinton, already the presumed front-runner, will face a primary challenge from the left.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s definitely going to have a primary. Who\u2019s going to let an open seat pass by?\u201d Dean said, but denied he had any interest in being that candidate.\n\nWho might? Dean named Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley, who made a well-received speech at a New Hampshire Democratic Party dinner last week and told reporters in August that he has been mulling a bid for the White House.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve already met with him about this,\u201d Dean said of O\u2019Malley. \u201cI think he wanted to know what [running for president] was like. He\u2019s a serious guy.\u201d\n\nAnd Warren? \u201cI think she\u2019d be terrific,\u201d he said.\n\nDean, who splits his time advising a Washington law firm, McKenna Long & Aldridge, with part-time teaching at three universities, doesn\u2019t sound like a man who\u2019s done with politics. He told the website Political Wire last week that he\u2019d \u201cgive anything to be in the White House\u201d to \u201ckick some serious butt over fixing\u201d the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, which has been plagued for weeks by major website glitches and complaints of cancelled plans.\n\n\u201cWe need to make this work,\u201d Dean said. \u201cThey ought to get all those Obama people out there and start calling people who lost their insurance policies and start signing them up for this.\u201d\n\nAsked if that\u2019s what he\u2019d be doing were he in the White House, Dean said, \u201cYou\u2019re damn right. I\u2019d have 10,000 kids volunteering to make these phone calls.\u201d\n\nDean argued that Organizing for Action, the nonprofit founded to organize support for the president\u2019s policy initiatives, should be taking a more active lead in helping to implement Obamacare. \u201cThat\u2019s the whole point. Why have it if they can\u2019t do anything,\u201d he said. \u201cThey cannot use OFA for getting people to vote for immigration \u2014 calling your nut-job congressman is not gonna move \u2018em an iota, because they\u2019re all in safe districts \u2014 but it could work for something like this.\u201d\n\nThe former Democratic National Committee chair also accused a swath of Democrats in the House of Representatives \u2014 the 39 members who voted last week for a bill that would allow people to keep their health insurance plans, overriding the recent wave of cancellations \u2014 of what he called the \u201cold panicked Democrats syndrome.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re just afraid. It\u2019s all short term,\u201d he said. \u201cSomebody\u2019s got to grab the bull by the horns and say, \u2018Look, behave yourself. I don\u2019t care if we go down to 10% in our favorability ratings. We\u2019ve got to get this done.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThese Democrats are screwed no matter what happens,\u201d Dean added. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how they vote on the bill. The only thing that\u2019s gonna save the Democratic Party right now is to have Obamacare work. We\u2019ve got about till March to do that. And I think we will do that. But we\u2019ve got to stop all this pussyfooting around and agonizing and just get the goddamn thing done.\u201d\n\nBut for Dean, the underlying foe in this recent panic over Obamacare is the media, what he called the \u201cthird failed institution\u201d behind Congress and Wall Street. \u201cIt drives me crazy,\u201d he said, arguing that more and more opinion and punditry makes its way into the pages of the country\u2019s biggest newspapers.\n\nDean said he manages his own account Twitter, where he only follows about 60 people \u2014 mostly friends \u2014 and often blocks people to keep himself from getting too worked up. \u201cI cut people off on the left not just on the right. And I\u2019m victimized by the Twitchies,\u201d he said, referring to the conservative website that curates tweets and often attacks members of the media. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve also realized there\u2019s a Twitchy on the left. Max Blumenthal is a Twitchy.\u201d\n\nFor now, though, it seems Dean is set on observing Washington from the outside.\n\n\u201cOnce you\u2019ve run for president, you realize how unbelievably difficult it is. You have to have the fire, knowing what you\u2019re facing,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd plus, I\u2019ve had a very enjoyable time in the last 10 years if you can believe it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"bf": {"buzzid": 2766679, "userid": 230577}, "google-signin-clientid": "895639880237-tcoheof19odpd88p676rjc70v0iqit0o.apps.googleusercontent.com", "description": "Probably not \u2014 but the former governor sure has ideas about what he'd be doing if he were running the White House, and whether...", "copyright": "Copyright 2016 BuzzFeed, Inc.
