Shabnam Tabinda and some of her fellow teachers want to change that \u2014 and are practicing how to shoot terrorists.\n\nGovernment authorities in Pakistan\u2019s northwest frontier have given permission for teachers to carry concealed firearms in response to the Dec. 16 attack in Peshawar that became one of the deadliest terrorist strikes in Pakistani history. Many educators reject the idea of arming teachers as reckless and counterproductive, reflecting the kind of arguments in U.S. school systems overshadowed by their own occasional mass shootings.\n\nBut for teachers like 37-year-old Tabinda, going to work unarmed no longer feels like an option. She and 10 other female teachers at the Frontier College for Women are taking pride in their newfound marksmanship with handguns, and plan to carry them to help protect their students aged 16 to 21.\n\nAsked whether she felt confident of killing a terrorist at her school, Tabinda was emphatic in reply: \u201cYes. Whoever kills innocents, God willing I will shoot them.\u201d\n\nMushtuq Ghani, the higher education minister in the Khyber Paktunkhwa provincial government based in Peshawar, says its Cabinet supports the arming of teachers as a logical measure given the reality that the region\u2019s 65,000 police are stretched too thin to provide a first line of defense to nearly 50,000 schools. Terrorists need to know that schools aren\u2019t defenseless, and armed teachers could potentially hold off gunmen and buy time for police reinforcements to arrive, he said. Teachers would need to provide their own legally licensed firearms, which many already possess to defend their homes.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at war,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Pakistani Taliban have killed tens of thousands over the past decade as it seeks to overthrow the government and impose its own harsh brand of Islam. Following the Peshawar attack, the government increased military operations in the tribal borderland with Afghanistan where the militants are based, reinstated the death penalty for people convicted of terrorism, and turned such prosecutions over to military courts in a bid to stop intimidation of witnesses and court officials.\n\nSchools nationwide were closed for several weeks following the Taliban attack on the Army Public School, when seven men disguised as Pakistani soldiers scaled a perimeter wall and opened fire on fleeing children, many of them the sons and daughters of military personnel. When students returned this month, many of their schools had beefed-up security including heightened security walls, closed-circuit surveillance systems and privately contracted guards.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Pakistani teachers arming selves in wake of school massacre", "title": "Pakistani teachers arming selves in wake of school massacre", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Pakistani teachers arming selves in wake of school massacre", "title": "Pakistani teachers arming selves in wake of school massacre", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/02/02/pakistani_teachers_arming_selves_in_wake_of_school_massacre/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/02/aptopix-pakistan-arming-teachers.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Pakistani teachers arming selves in wake of school massacre", "title": "Pakistani teachers arming selves in wake of school massacre", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/02/aptopix-pakistan-arming-teachers.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Asif Shahzad", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2aa8\"", "article_summary": "Topics: From the Wires, NewsPESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) \u2014 When Pakistani Taliban militants stormed a Peshawar school and massacred 150 children and teachers, nobody could fight back.\nAsked whether she felt confident of killing a terrorist at her school, Tabinda was emphatic in reply: \u201cYes.\nThe Pakistani Taliban have killed tens of thousands over the past decade as it seeks to overthrow the government and impose its own harsh brand of Islam.\nShabnam Tabinda and some of her fellow teachers want to change that \u2014 and are practicing how to shoot terrorists.\nMany educators reject the idea of arming teachers as reckless and counterproductive, reflecting the kind of arguments in U.S. school systems overshadowed by their own occasional mass shootings."}
