Why would a life-sized statue of a half-naked man, dressed just in his white undies, be displayed on the grounds of the pristine, prestigious campus of the all-female Wellesley College in Massachusetts?\n\nThen came my split-second follow-up reaction: \u201cWhy has this statue, \u2018The Sleepwalker\u2019 by Tony Matelli, caused such an over-the-top feminist fuss?\u201d\n\nIn a recent Wall Street Journal piece, Lenore Skenazy writes, \u201cGrab the smelling salts, ladies,\u201d as she takes on the 700 \u201cangry and aggrieved students and alumni\u201d who have signed a petition demanding the removal of the statue.\n\nThe feminists, you see, feel that the male image is a \u201ctrigger,\u201d a catalyst that can stir up memories of a sexual assault, even though in the words of another writer, this image \u201calso triggers \u2026 a kind of pity, tinged with fear on his behalf. He\u2019s out of place, there\u2019s snow in his nostrils, he\u2019s vulnerable.\u201d\n\nOne petitioner wrote, \u201cA school endorsing the decision to expose its female students to this \u2026 violates the Civil Rights Law.\u201d\n\nBut, Skenazy counters, \u201cSince when is it a \u2018civil right\u2019 not to be offended by a piece of art? Who gets to decide which art we chuck?\u201d\n\nWellesley alum Sheila Kowal, a retired financial adviser, might very well chuck \u201cThe Sleepwalker\u201d in his entirety. Kowal feels that it represents a \u201ccoarsening of the culture \u2026 that its ratchet-up \u2018shock factor\u2019 and its baiting of women to react is a form of sexism itself.\u201d\n\nPerhaps I\u2019m taking the \u201cbait,\u201d but I find I agree with Skenazy\u2019s argument against this new wave of \u201cpolitical correctness.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a great irony in hearing that so many Wellesley students, espousing feminist rhetoric, want to be treated like Victorian maidens, too delicate to view a statue of a guy in his undies. It\u2019s the opposite of feminism,\u201d continues Skenazy.\n\nIn 2002, the Justice Department under Attorney General John Ashcroft ordered the breast 0f the mostly nude female statue \u201cLady Justice\u201d covered in blue cloth so as not to offend certain sensibilities. Do feminists want to be joined at the hip with their censors on the right?\n\n\u201cI thought from the beginning the protesters were way off base and making themselves look a little silly,\u201d said Wellesley alum Sigrid Freese of Denver. \u201cWhy haven\u2019t the students made a joke of it and dressed the guy in a Wellesley sweatshirt and sarong or kilt? I feel there are far more troubling issues to protest about both on campus and off.\u201d\n\nActually, some students have made a joke of it. Reports abound of giggling college girls throwing snowballs at the statue, dressing him in outlandish outfits, posing with him and sending photos out on Facebook or Twitter.\n\nIn response to the petitioners, Wellesley president H. Kim Bottomly on Feb. 20 ruled that the statue would stay where it is until Matelli\u2019s temporary exhibit ends in the spring.\n\nAnother Wellesley alum, a clergywoman who prefers to remain anonymous, brought me up a little short: \u201cAlthough I don\u2019t particularly like the statue and am glad it is not a permanent addition to campus, I don\u2019t think it should be removed to protect the students. But then, I have never been raped or physically abused.\u201d\n\nNeither have I.\n\nBut what if I had been? And then, what if I had subsequently encountered this looming spectral image on a dark and snowy night? Yes, I might have been shocked, scared, even terrorized for at least a moment.\n\nSo, then, would I have taken a deep breath, powered through the fear, and not let it \u201ctrigger\u201d me into signing a petition that could curb my own right to free expression and those rights of my classmates in the future?\n\nI hope so.\n\nDottie Lamm (dolamm59@gmail.com), former first lady of Colorado, is a psychiatric social worker and a feminist activist.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Lamm: Does half-naked Wellesley statue belong on campus?", "title": "Lamm: Does half-naked Wellesley statue belong on campus?", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/03/07/lamm-does-half-naked-wellesley-statue-belong-on-campus/", "image": {"width": 653, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140307__20140309_D4_OP09C_LAMMp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140307__20140309_D4_OP09C_LAMMp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-07T14:27:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T21:00:59+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1332\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI thought from the beginning the protesters were way off base and making themselves look a little silly,\u201d said Wellesley alum Sigrid Freese of Denver.\nWhy would a life-sized statue of a half-naked man, dressed just in his white undies, be displayed on the grounds of the pristine, prestigious campus of the all-female Wellesley College in Massachusetts?\n\u201cWhy haven\u2019t the students made a joke of it and dressed the guy in a Wellesley sweatshirt and sarong or kilt?\nDottie Lamm (dolamm59@gmail.com), former first lady of Colorado, is a psychiatric social worker and a feminist activist.\nI feel there are far more troubling issues to protest about both on campus and off.\u201dActually, some students have made a joke of it."}
