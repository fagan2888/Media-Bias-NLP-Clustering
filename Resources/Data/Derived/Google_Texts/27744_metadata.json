Every structure in the geographical area will not require re-treatment,\u201d said Deputy Director Michael Weyman in a memorandum that was sent to pest control companies.\n\nCases calling for re-treatment basically involve disturbance along the foundation or if a certain chemical treatment was used.\n\nWeyman said re-treatment is needed \u201cif the soil within the treatment zone (approximately 6 inches deep and 6 inches wide immediately adjacent to foundation elements) demonstrates signs of erosion, displacement, shift or otherwise exhibits signs of being physically disturbed.\u201d\n\nHe added that re-treatment is needed if significant amounts of soil, including silt, sand or mud, was deposited over the treatment zone.\n\nIf a company treated wood with borates, containing the active ingredient disodium octaborate tetrahydrate, or DOT, Weyman said judgment on re-treatment of wood exposed to floodwaters should err on the side of caution.\n\nThe inorganic salt could have leached from the wood and no longer provide termite protection. The same goes for treated wood exposed to running or dripping water.\n\nHe also urged homeowners to review pest-control contracts for guarantees for re-treatment in the event of flooding, as well to contact insurance companies to add the cost of re-treatment to any losses suffered.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "After historic flooding, does your home need to be treated again for termites?
