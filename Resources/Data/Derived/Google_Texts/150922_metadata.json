This is like handing someone a drill and expecting them to perform root canal surgery.\n\nHence, Flexson\u2019s VinylPlay received quite a few admiring glances when it was unveiled this week in the UK.\n\nIt\u2019s proper, British hi-fi (for any youngsters still reading, this refers nostalgically to the era when Britannia, or at least her hi-fi separates, ruled the airwaves, an era that slowly ground to a halt as everyone decided that iPod docks were a decent substitute for actual hi-fis).\n\nIt will tease the best out of your old discs, or indeed new ones, but it\u2019s also sensibly determined to make converting old records easy.\n\nWell, easier, at least. Not only does it come with a \u2018Quick Start\u2019 guide sitting helpfully on the vinyl platter, there is also a full video guide online showing you how to use the fancier functions, including converting records to digital.\n\nThis process is still a bit long-winded, and really only for precious, irreplaceable discs you can\u2019t get anywhere else, but having a video guide works wonders.\n\nIt will also teach you how to pipe the sound through your home via a Sonos multiroom speaker system, a function unique to this deck. But it\u2019s far from a onetrick pony.\n\nIts makers are aware of the fact they\u2019ve got to walk a tightrope between white-haired old geezers like me, and young trendies with improbable beards who are enjoying the pumped-up sounds of new and classic discs released on the heavier, better-sounding 180g vinyl.\n\nLast year, more vinyl records sold in the UK than 1991.\n\nNext year, the sales figures are expected to rise again, by another 40 per cent.\n\nEven for those of us on the down ramp of life, it may be worth heading to the shops for some new discs \u2013 the remastered Led Zeppelin albums are particularly worth a listen.\n\nThe Flexson really bends over backwards to make things easy: it\u2019s got an analogue-to-digital converter and phono pre-amp builtin, so it will genuinely be working in minutes.\n\nYou can plug it direct into just about any stereo worth the name, sling some vinyl on, and it\u2019ll play \u2013 and sound good.\n\nThe high-quality converter ensures that any songs you DO convert sound vaguely like you remember them, rather than as if played on a really terrible record player at the bottom of a well, as is the case with most vinyl-to-PC decks which come in at less than \u00a3500.", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "divclassbody": "robwaugheventforthemailonsunday", "news_keywords": "Flexson,s,VinylPlay,There,s,never,affordable,turntable,digitises,vinyl,sound,like,proper,hi,fi,now", "original-source": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/event/article-2768493/Flexson-s-VinylPlay-There-s-never-affordable-turntable-digitises-vinyl-sound-like-proper-hi-fi-now.html", "doc-class": "Living Document", "twitter": {"account_id": 15438913, "title": "It's a record breaker!
