Drugs or alcohol may have been a factor in a rollover crash that killed a 19-year-old who was speeding Thursday morning on 22nd Avenue South, St. Petersburg police said.

The crash occurred at 5:40 a.m. on the 2600 block of 22nd Avenue South near 26th Street, investigators said.

Justis Emmanuel Mack, of 2901 13th Ave. S., was pronounced dead at the scene.

Mack was driving a 1998 Dodge Intrepid west on 22nd at a high rate of speed, made a quick lane change for an unknown reason and lost control on the vehicle, police said.

The front right tire of Mackâ€™s vehicle struck the north curb at 26th Street and briefly drove onto the tree line, police said. The car entered 22nd again and continued west in an uncontrolled manner before driving over the north curb at Auburn Street South and striking a large palm tree, police said.

The impact caused the vehicle to flip several times.

The results of a toxicology report on Mack are pending, police said.
