But since its creation 20 years ago, it has also depended on external funding.\n\nThe clinic faced possible closure in December 2012 after losing financial support from Mercy Hospital and the city.\n\nMercy, which had been suffering financial difficulties of its own, stopped its annual contribution of about $200,000 in 2011. Emergency funding from the city dried up a year later.\n\nThen, after a series of news reports, the Emanuel & Pauline A. Lerner Foundation pledged a challenge grant of $25,000 to keep the clinic open. In less than a month, a variety of gifts from charitable groups and individuals had brought the clinic more than $93,000, enough to remain in operation through this year.\n\nNow the clinic\u2019s prognosis has improved, slightly.\n\n\u201cI am confident that we can make our payroll and expectations until the first of July,\u201d clinical programs director Dr. Caroline Teschke said last week.\n\nSince last year\u2019s crisis, Teschke said, the clinic has had \u201cmodest\u201d success obtaining support through additional grants, individual donations, and fundraising events such as a holiday concert last Saturday at St. Ansgar Lutheran Church, in the Rosemont neighborhood. A charitable auction is planned for next March.\n\nThe clinic also continues to receive in-kind aid from the city, which provides office space and insurance coverage, and from Mercy, which helps out with free laboratory services.\n\nIn addition, the clinic has applied to become an independent nonprofit organization, a status that would provide tax and legal benefits. After receiving free help with the application process from Portland law firm Verrill Dana, Teschke said she expects to receive approval from the federal government sometime next year.\n\nBut meanwhile, the need for the clinic\u2019s care \u201cis in no way diminished,\u201d she said. In fact, it may be increasing.\n\nUnlike other public health clinics in the city, the Free Clinic specializes in caring for the working poor, a population that is overlooked amid the much-publicized debate over the federal Affordable Care Act, also known as \u201cObamacare.\u201d\n\nThe ACA was touted as reducing the number of Americans without health coverage by expanding eligibility for Medicaid, and providing subsidies to help those who were ineligible to buy insurance through state-run health exchanges.\n\nBut the act doesn\u2019t help many people in the middle: those who are ineligible for Medicaid, but for whom the subsidies aren\u2019t enough. In Maine, this gap in coverage is compounded by the state\u2019s refusal to participate in the optional expanded Medicaid coverage.\n\nAnd the problem is about to get worse. On Jan. 1, 2014, as many as 25,000 state residents will lose their Medicaid coverage, called MaineCare, because of eligibility changes made two years ago.\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act was written with the assumption that every state would take the expansion. There is nothing for [the working poor],\u201d Teschke said. \u201c\u2026 A [health] plan that costs $300 with a subsidy may as well be $3,000.\u201d\n\nClinic patients can earn up to 250 percent of the federal poverty level, which for a single person represents an annual income of about $27,000. That range accommodates artists, small-business owners, restaurant workers and others who eke out a living without access to health care.\n\n\u201cWe see people between jobs, but we also see a lot of people who are just piecing [an income] together and don\u2019t have insurance or even sick days,\u201d public health nurse Bob Barrett said.\n\nOne such patient is Erin Curren, of Westbrook, who works as an actor, a movement teacher and a Bowdoin College lecturer. But none of her jobs provide health benefits. So Curren recently turned to the clinic for a routine physical exam.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where I would have been able to get such a comprehensive check-up if the clinic weren\u2019t here,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt like this was as good care as I\u2019ve gotten when I did have insurance.\u201d\n\nDespite the continued demand for the clinic\u2019s services and its uncertain funding, Teschke said she\u2019s cautiously optimistic it can succeed by being \u201cflexible and nimble.\u201d\n\nLike its patients, the clinic is practiced at making the most of scant resources, relying on its volunteers, obtaining $150,000 in free medication each year for patients, and even turning to online bulletin board Craigslist.com to seek donations of medical equipment.\n\nAs a result, program coordinator Leslie Nicoll estimated, every dollar of the clinic\u2019s budget ultimately provides about $15 of patient care.\n\n\u201cWe already do so much with so little \u2026 a small amount of money parlays into a lot of services,\u201d Teschke said. \u201cEven if [our budget] is only a shoestring, it still has a lot to hold up.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "PORTLAND, Maine \u2014 One year after nearly being forced to close, the Portland Community Free Clinic is no longer on life support, but remains in serious condition.
