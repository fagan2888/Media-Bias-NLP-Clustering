Mitchell, SD

Cabela’s was seeing great sales with traffic in the store that was better than last year. By the end of next weekend, Cabela’s expects to see hunters from all 50 states. Popular items include their Upland apparel and ammunition. This time of year is so successful for the store; they even named it a special holiday.

“We call it our Orange Friday as it's a bigger day here in Mitchell than our Black Friday is. So last Friday was our biggest day and throughout the weekend we call this our Tan and Blaze Christmas,” Retail Marketing Specialist Jen Johnston said.

The Store plans on capping off the weekend event tonight with giving out $200,000 in prizes and a grand prize of a Coleman ATV.
