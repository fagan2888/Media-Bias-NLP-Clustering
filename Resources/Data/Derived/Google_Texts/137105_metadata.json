To make it more wrenching Saturday night, the 27-24 loss at Sports Authority Field at Mile High was to in-state rival Colorado in the Rocky Mountain Showdown, meaning \u2014 among many other things \u2014 a few CSU fans will have to pay off lunch and beer bets to co-workers and friends.\n\nFirst-year CSU coach Mike Bobo said his postgame message to his team was both a challenge and praise, beginning with a declaration that any team he coaches would play hard, not quit and be \u201call in.\u201d He said he added: \u201cFor three games, we played hard, we\u2019ve been all in and played for 60 minutes-plus in the last two games. I expect the same thing Monday. If that\u2019s not for you, if you doubt what we\u2019re doing, my office will be open (Sunday) and you can come in. But the guys that are going to wear the green and gold are going to play hard for the green and gold every week.\u201d\n\nLate in his postgame news conference, Bobo acknowledged he understood that last season\u2019s 10-3 record under Jim McElwain \u2014 which included a 10-1 start \u2014 was a tough act to follow, given the departures of quarterback Garrett Grayson and running back Dee Hart. The Rams also lost Ty Sambrailo, now starting at offensive tackle for the Broncos, and other key players.\n\n\u201cComing into the season, I knew it would take time,\u201d Bobo said. \u201cWhen you lose a 1,000-yard rusher, when you lose a 4,000-yard passer at quarterback \u2026 and I felt we needed to play great defense. We\u2019re playing great defense and we\u2019re getting better on offense. The record\u2019s just 1-2 and we\u2019ll stick to the plan. I believe we\u2019ll be fine this year.\u201d\n\nThe challenge for the Rams \u2014 who led 14-0 after the first quarter and ultimately outgained the Buffs 500 yards to 345 \u2014 is to stay together.\n\nCSU seems to have a winnable road game coming up, against Texas-San Antonio of Conference USA. The Roadrunners lost 69-14 to Oklahoma State and fell to 0-3.\n\nAfter Saturday\u2019s game at the Alamodome, Mountain West play begins for the Rams. Mountain West teams have been struggling in nonconference games.\n\nBut first, there is the sting of back-to-back overtime losses for the Rams to overcome.\n\n\u201cIt hurts,\u201d said senior safety Trent Matthews, who will be playing in his hometown Saturday. \u201cIt\u2019s like they killed your joy. It kills your momentum. It makes you sometimes kind of wonder what kind of team we are. But I\u2019ll tell you what, this team we have right here is a wonderful team. We\u2019re going to stick together, we\u2019re a family, and in a family, sometimes things happen.\n\n\u201cAs a leader, I\u2019m going to \u2026 keep encouraging my teammates because we\u2019re a good football team and I know we\u2019re going to be successful.\u201d\n\nMatthews added, \u201cLast year, we finished. This year, we\u2019re not finishing what we\u2019re supposed to. Last year, we had an electrifying offense; this year we\u2019re electrifying on defense. That\u2019s the key components of our team last year and this year. But (it\u2019s) the same brotherhood, same logo, same jerseys. We just didn\u2019t find a way to win (the CU game).\u201d\n\nSophomore quarterback Nick Stevens was 25-of-39 passing for 282 yards against the Buffs, rebounding after being pulled late in the third quarter of the 23-20 overtime loss to Minnesota.\n\n\u201cI definitely felt like I had a better day than last week,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cI felt like the offense, we moved the ball really well. \u2026 I felt like we moved the ball every drive, just didn\u2019t finish.\u201d\n\nOne bright spot for the Rams was that sophomore running back Dalyn Dawkins, a transfer from Purdue, rushed for 118 yards against CU, and he and Jasen Oden Jr. combined for 198 yards on the ground. That came a year after Hart and Treyous Jarrells combined for 260 yards in a 31-17 win over the Buffs.\n\n\u201cIt hurts and hurts even more that the same thing happened last week,\u201d Dawkins said of the loss.\n\nTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost.com or @TFrei\n\nEye on \u2026The Roadrunners\n\nColorado State at Texas-San Antonio, 5 p.m. Saturday, CBSSN\n\nFor the record: The Roadrunners fell to 0-3 after losing to Oklahoma State 69-14.\n\nStreaking: Texas-San Antonio has played 29 consecutive Football Bowl Subdivision opponents since Nov. 10, 2012.\n\nWho\u2019s hot: Quarterback Blake Bogenschutze has completed 59.6 percent of his 89 passes for 546 yards and three touchdowns. But he has thrown three interceptions.\n\nWho\u2019s not: The defense hasn\u2019t been solid. The Roadrunners have been outscored 141-49.\n\nKey stat: Tight end Dave Morgan has 15 catches for 200 yards and one touchdown, including nine receptions for 109 yards in the season opener against Arizona.\n\nFYI: This is only the fifth season of football for the Roadrunners.\n\nIrv Moss, The Denver Post", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Loss to Colorado not sitting well with Colorado State", "title": "Loss to Colorado not sitting well with Colorado State", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/09/20/loss-to-colorado-not-sitting-well-with-colorado-state/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150920__BN20150921_Z00_BNSP21FBCCSUp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150920__BN20150921_Z00_BNSP21FBCCSUp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-20T20:16:44+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T20:32:27+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Colorado State University"}, "article_summary": "For the second consecutive week, the Colorado State Rams had fallen to a power five conference team in overtime.\n\u201cWhen you lose a 1,000-yard rusher, when you lose a 4,000-yard passer at quarterback \u2026 and I felt we needed to play great defense.\n\u201cIt hurts and hurts even more that the same thing happened last week,\u201d Dawkins said of the loss.\nThe Rams also lost Ty Sambrailo, now starting at offensive tackle for the Broncos, and other key players.\nIf that\u2019s not for you, if you doubt what we\u2019re doing, my office will be open (Sunday) and you can come in."}
