In \u201cThe Value of Medicaid: Interpreting Results from the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment,\u201d Finkelstein, Nathaniel Hendren, and Erzo Luttmer, used various econometric methods to quantify the benefits that enrollees receive from Medicaid. They drew from the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment, on which Finkelstein was a lead investigator.\n\nThe trio found that Medicaid enrollees receive very little benefit from each dollar spent on Medicaid. The absolute minimum enrollees receive is 15 cents of benefit per dollar spent. The authors\u2019 best guess is that enrollees receive somewhere around 20-40 cents of benefit per dollar spent. The maximum is 90 cents\u2013that is, no matter how the authors sliced the data, Medicaid\u2019s costs exceed the benefits to enrollees. If the government just gave enrollees the money, Medicaid is such a bad deal that enrollees would not buy Medicaid coverage with it.\n\nMedicaid spends, non-enrollees receive about 60 cents of benefit. The authors don\u2019t identify who Medicaid\u2019s real beneficiaries are, but they likely include those who receive Medicaid subsidies (hospitals, insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies, doctors, device manufacturers) and people who would otherwise make charitable contributions to provide medical care to enrollees. In other words, Medicaid\u2019s actual beneficiaries are different from its intended beneficiaries.\n\nThat\u2019s something to keep in mind when President Obama says, \u201cThere are outcomes we can calculate\u201d like \u201cthe number of newly insured families\u201d and that \u201cthose numbers add up to success.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "If the government just gave enrollees the money, Medicaid is such a bad deal that enrollees would not buy Medicaid coverage with it.", "og": {"site_name": "Cato Institute", "description": "If the government just gave enrollees the money, Medicaid is such a bad deal that enrollees would not buy Medicaid coverage with it.", "title": "More Bad News for ObamaCare: Enrollees See Little Benefit from Medicaid Expansion", "url": "http://www.cato.org/blog/more-bad-news-obamacare-enrollees-see-little-benefit-medicaid-expansion", "image": "http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/default_images/blog_torch_large.gif", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.cato.org/blog/more-bad-news-obamacare-enrollees-see-little-benefit-medicaid-expansion", "title": "More Bad News for ObamaCare: Enrollees See Little Benefit from Medicaid Expansion", "description": "If the government just gave enrollees the money, Medicaid is such a bad deal that enrollees would not buy Medicaid coverage with it.", "card": "summary", "creator": "@CatoInstitute"}, "robots": "noodp", "site": "Cato Institute", "node_creation_date": "2015/6/9", "fb": {"admins": 5311211, "app_id": 158687980817033}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-09T12:17:00-04:00"}, "publication_date": "2015/6/9", "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The trio found that Medicaid enrollees receive very little benefit from each dollar spent on Medicaid.\nIf the government just gave enrollees the money, Medicaid is such a bad deal that enrollees would not buy Medicaid coverage with it.\nThe authors\u2019 best guess is that enrollees receive somewhere around 20-40 cents of benefit per dollar spent.\nThe absolute minimum enrollees receive is 15 cents of benefit per dollar spent.\nIn \u201cThe Value of Medicaid: Interpreting Results from the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment,\u201d Finkelstein, Nathaniel Hendren, and Erzo Luttmer, used various econometric methods to quantify the benefits that enrollees receive from Medicaid."}
