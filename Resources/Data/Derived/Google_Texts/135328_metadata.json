The seedlings created will be transplanted to a new two-acre community garden on the hospital property on South Newton Street sometime in April.\n\nRanging from tomatoes, beans and gourds to fruits and berries, the goal is to provide local food banks and schools with fresh vegetables produced on the plot.\n\nLast year, Memorial Hospital had about a three-quarter-acre garden that provided fresh fruit and vegetables to the hospital\u2019s staff and patients. But this year, the hospital foundation is expanding that impact into the community to help food-insecure families have access to fresh foods.\n\n\u201cThere are, believe it or not, kids in our county that take food home on the weekend so they have enough to eat when they can\u2019t get meals from the school,\u201d Foundation executive director Mike Jones said.\n\nAccording to most recently available data, about 11 percent of kids in the county are food-insecure.\n\nJones added that the Affordable Care Act is also pushing the move to create a community-wide health impact. \u201cYou are talking about population health,\u201d he said. \u201cThe movement is to keep people out of hospitals and one way to do it is to eat the proper foods.\u201d\n\nJones sees the Hope Garden as an extension for the hospital to impact the community as well as utilize the donated property on South Newton Street. Depending on how the garden grows, he envisions raised beds to allow handicapped volunteers access to help out as well as future expansion. The large stable area that currently holds the county\u2019s emergency command post trailer and a Memorial Hospital float could be turned into a greenhouse for year-round veggies.\n\n\u201cI have asked the hospital for an employee to oversee the process in the future,\u201d he added.\n\nFor now though, the HOPE (Helping Others Produce Excitement) Garden will be volunteer driven utilizing Fifth Street\u2019s Wellness Committee, Memorial Hospital, Tri-Cap and the Purdue Extension\u2019s resources.\n\nAll the seeds used in the garden have been donated by Rural King and Superior Ag, according to Jones.\n\n\u201cHopefully the kids who planted these seeds will be able to come back in August and see the garden they created,\u201d he said.\n\nDeanne Achbach and Brad Leistner volunteered to tend the garden last year but the larger garden this year will need more hands to help. Anyone seeking to help or make contributions can contact the Memorial Hospital Foundation at 812-996-8428.\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nPocket\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\n\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "article_metadata": {"generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "og": {"site_name": "Dubois County Free Press", "description": "Most of the dirt made it into the hundreds of egg cartons lining the tables.
