But in the London borough of Haringey, the authority is now renting back 28 of the 396 homes it has sold under right-to-buy at a cost of more than \u00a3265,000 a year.\n\nCampaigners said the figures from just 33 councils, could be the tip of the iceberg.\n\nRachel Fisher, head of policy at the National Housing Federation, said: \u201cRight to buy has decimated the supply of affordable homes to rent at a time when we have a major housing crisis and a real problem of affordability.\n\n\u201cSocial housing should be reserved for those who need it most but right to buy is perpetuating the belief that homes are an investment rather than somewhere to live.\u201d\n\nHousing minister Brandon Lewis, however, defended the scheme which was first introduced by Margaret Thatcher.\n\n\u201cRight to buy helps social tenants get on to the housing ladder, increases housing construction and reduces social-housing waiting lists,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery additional home sold will be replaced with a new affordable home.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Cornwall Council has paid out more than \u00a38,000 to rent back council houses it recently sold under the right-to-buy scheme, it had emerged.\n\nAn investigation by The Independent showed the council...", "og": {"site_name": "Western Morning News", "description": "Cornwall Council has paid out more than \u00a38,000 to rent back council houses it recently sold under the right-to-buy scheme, it had emerged.\n\nAn investigation by The Independent showed the council...", "language": "en", "title": "Cornwall Council rents homes it sold under right-to-buy", "url": "http://www.westernmorningnews.co.uk/Cornwall-Council-rents-homes-sold-right-buy/story-23895055-detail/story.html", "image": "http://www.westernmorningnews.co.uk/images/localworld/ugc-images/276272/Article/images/23895055/7630088.jpg", "type": "article", "section": "UK news"}, "twitter": {"description": "Cornwall Council has paid out more than \u00a38,000 to rent back council houses it recently sold under the right-to-buy scheme, it had emerged.\n\nAn investigation by The Independent showed the council...", "title": "Cornwall Council rents homes it sold under right-to-buy", "url": "http://www.westernmorningnews.co.uk/Cornwall-Council-rents-homes-sold-right-buy/story-23895055-detail/story.html", "image": "http://www.westernmorningnews.co.uk/images/localworld/ugc-images/276272/Article/images/23895055/7630088.jpg", "site": "WMNNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "site": {"domain": "http://www.westernmorningnews.co.uk"}, "DC.date.issued": "2014-11-01", "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": "627876018,720666011,1064606560,100000421938678", "app_id": 376137025924193}, "msvalidate.01": "C1FC943041AC66B017981683C4A59C1E", "article": {"tag": "Western Morning News", "published_time": "2014-11-01T15:55:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-01T16:01:28+00:00", "author": "http://www.westernmorningnews.co.ukhttp://www.westernmorningnews.co.uk/people/WMNAGreenwood/profile.html"}, "y_key": "375f1bbd5088049b", "decorator": "newspaper-standard"}, "article_summary": "Cornwall Council has paid out more than \u00a38,000 to rent back council houses it recently sold under the right-to-buy scheme, it had emerged.\nCornwall Council said it had sold 74 homes since the Government revamped the right-to-buy scheme in 2012.\n\u201cRight to buy helps social tenants get on to the housing ladder, increases housing construction and reduces social-housing waiting lists,\u201d he said.\nBut in the London borough of Haringey, the authority is now renting back 28 of the 396 homes it has sold under right-to-buy at a cost of more than \u00a3265,000 a year.\nAn investigation by The Independent showed the council was among at least 32 authorities having to shell out for properties they once owned outright."}
