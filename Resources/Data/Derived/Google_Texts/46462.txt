Two teenagers were killed in a single-vehicle accident in Stemmons Corridor on Saturday night, police say.

Dallas police responded to the intersection of Regal Row and Irving Boulevard about 11 p.m. where a 2003 Toyota Celica had crashed into a concrete pillar supporting an overpass.

Police said racing appears to be the cause of the crash.

The driver, 18-year-old Luis Reyes, was transported to a hospital where he later died from his injuries. The passenger, 16-year-old Andres Mendez, was pronounced dead at the scene, police said.

The victims attended Nimitz High School in Irving. Crisis counselors will be available when classes resume Tuesday.

“Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of the students who passed away,” Irving ISD spokeswoman Lesley Weaver said.
