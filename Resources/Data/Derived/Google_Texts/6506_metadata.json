They also may be a little closer to uniting behind a candidate for president who can win by addressing the concerns of everyday Americans.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s just say everybody\u2019s going to have to answer some serious questions.\u201d -@mschlapp on #CPAC2015\n\nThat, at least, is the goal of Matt Schlapp, who heads the team putting on the Conservative Political Action Conference, better known as CPAC.\n\n\u201cWe have to be able to reach [regular Americans] where they are and explain to them why conservative policies matter,\u201d Schlapp says in an interview with The Daily Signal. \u201cIn the last presidential campaign, that connection did not happen. I don\u2019t want to get personal about why; it just didn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nIn June, Schlapp assumed the chairmanship of the American Conservative Union. Leaders in the conservative movement founded the Washington-based umbrella group on shared principles in 1964; a decade later, it began organizing CPAC as a regular gathering of activists.\n\nBeginning Wednesday, Schlapp will welcome thousands of conservatives from across the country as they come together for four days of speeches, panels, exhibits and other activities at the Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center outside Washington, D.C.\n\nBesides White House hopefuls, attendees will hear from an A-list of conservative heroes. Making a long-awaited return to CPAC on Friday morning will be Fox News and talk-radio host Sean Hannity.\n\nInnovations this year include a \u201cless grandiose\u201d stage that will extend into the audience, CPAC\u2019s version of a runway like one Bono or Beyonce might prowl. Also new: repeated opportunities for attendees to question presidential hopefuls rather than just listen, and an afternoon devoted to preparing activists to make a difference back home.\n\nJeb Bush, the former Florida governor, embraced what Schlapp calls the \u201cup front\u201d concept. Bush, who is striving to make inroads with conservatives who view him with some suspicion over his immigration and education stances, decided to devote his entire 20 minutes to a question-and-answer session.\n\nIn a move sure to impress, Bush is slated to field questions from an unimpeachable conservative. (Update 2:30 p.m.: Hannity, who will speak earlier Friday and for years has called for a \u201ctrue conservative\u201d candidate, will be that questioner, CPAC spokesman Ian Walters confirmed to The Daily Signal.)\n\n\u201cThey want a strong conservative who can convince people that conservative ideas will fix these problems that the country faces.\u201d -@mschlapp\n\n>>> Sean Hannity to Put Jeb Bush on CPAC Hot Seat\n\nWisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and other potential candidates for president\u2014even if they choose to open with the traditional prepared remarks\u2014will be expected to answer six to eight minutes of queries filtered through CPAC officials.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s just say everybody\u2019s going to have to answer some serious questions,\u201d Schlapp, 47, tells The Daily Signal. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be fair about those questions. We\u2019re not looking to embarrass any of the candidates.\u201d\n\nIn a first, Wednesday from 1:30 to 5:30 p.m. will be dedicated to an \u201cactivism boot camp,\u201d with additional offerings through Friday. The idea: concentrated training for the younger contingent\u2014today\u2019s millennials\u2014that traditionally makes up a significant bloc of CPAC attendees. The theme: \u201cConservative Action Starts Here.\u201d\n\nSuch changes, Schlapp says, show that he and other ACU veterans are determined to respond to the needs of those who will talk to family, friends and co-workers and get involved in campaigns.\n\nWith the notable exception of former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, who pleaded a scheduling conflict, most of the likeliest Republican candidates have 20-minute slots on the main stage Thursday or Friday.\n\nBetween stints as a congressional aide and a federal affairs executive for Koch Industries, Schlapp was White House political director during President George W. Bush\u2019s first term through his re-election in 2004. Schlapp agrees with those who describe the initial field of Republican 2016 hopefuls as both big and impressive.\n\n\u201cI think what\u2019s also fantastic,\u201d he says, \u201cis that they\u2019re all grabbing the mantle of \u2018I\u2019m a conservative.\u2019 \u201d\n\nCPAC attendees will be among the first to probe that claim.\n\nThaleigha Rampersad produced the video excerpts of the interview.
