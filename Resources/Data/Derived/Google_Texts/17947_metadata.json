A few years later, he was there to see Babe Ruth call his shot.\n\nA lot changed over the years \u2014 a job in a different field, on another kind of bench \u2014 but retired Supreme CourtJustice John Paul Stevens never lost faith in the Chicago Cubs.\n\nNow 95 and older than the ivy at the ballpark, Stevens offers an opinion on their title drought dating to 1908.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a question of whether they\u2019ll win a championship,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s whether I\u2019ll still be here to see it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are close,\u201d he said. \u201cWill it happen soon enough?\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s begin right there as Major League Baseball gets loosened up for opening day.\n\nPitchers Zack Greinke, David Price and Johnny Cueto start fresh with new teams. Boston Red Sox slugger David Ortiz and Los Angeles Dodgers broadcaster Vin Scully are on deck for fond farewells.\n\nBryce Harper, Mike Trout, Carlos Correa, Nolan Arenado and Noah Syndergaard among the young, bright stars all over the diamond.\n\nBarry Bonds back in play, as the hitting coach for the Miami Marlins. Dusty Baker back in the dugout, managing the Washington Nationals.\n\nA year after the Cubs, the Houston Astros, the Toronto Blue Jays and the Texas Rangers took huge strides to make the playoffs, fans are wondering who\u2019s next.\n\nAmerican League Cy Young Award winner Dallas Keuchel saw what happened with the Astros. His first full year was 2013, when they lost 111 games.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a progression,\u201d the lefty said. \u201cYou get better individually, and you get better as a team.\u201d\n\nMLB has made changes, too, on and off the field.\n\nThere\u2019s the \u201cChase Utley Rule\u201d that outlaws certain vicious takeout slides, but the old \u201cneighborhood play\u201d at second base is now reviewable, and many wonder whether that will put middle infielders in peril. Some ballparks, including Nationals Park, added extra netting to protect fans from foul balls that rocket into the seats.\n\nAs always, injuries took a toll in spring training. St. Louis Cardinals shortstop Jhonny Peralta, Dodgers outfielder Andre Ethier and Arizona Diamondbacks outfielder A.J. Pollock won\u2019t be ready for openers. Pitchers Yu Darvish, Zack Wheeler, Homer Bailey and Alex Cobb seem to be recovering neatly from Tommy John surgery and are expected back soon enough.\n\nSo, how will things shake out?\n\nThe San Francisco Giants hopes their odd-even pattern holds after winning titles in 2010, 2012 and 2014. The Giants missed the playoffs last year, then added Cueto and Jeff Samardzija and former Nationals outfielder Denard Span.\n\n\u201cThis is as solid as I think we\u2019ve been, and that\u2019s saying a lot,\u201d manager Bruce Bochy said.\n\nAfter consecutive last-place finishes, Boston added Price and closer Craig Kimbrel. Arizona bolstered its rotation with Greinke and Shelby Miller.\n\nThe Royals apparently didn\u2019t do enough to impress the stat-heads. A couple of numbers-based sites predicted Kansas City will finish below .500.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re probably never going to pick us to win it, no matter what we do,\u201d all-star outfielder Lorenzo Cain said.\n\nA season after getting swept by the pitching-rich Mets in the National League Championship Series, the Cubs acquired outfielder Jason Heyward, starter John Lackey and second baseman Ben Zobrist.\n\nThey joined Cy Young winner Jake Arrieta and young boppers Kris Bryant, Anthony Rizzo and Kyle Schwarber on a team clearly dressed for success. As manager Joe Maddon told his players about clubhouse culture, \u201cIf you think you look hot, you wear it.\u201d\n\nWhether that adds up to a Cubs crown, we\u2019ll find out. It\u2019s a supreme vacancy Justice Stevens wants to see filled.\n\nA few years after he began listening to their games on radio, Stevens was 9 when he saw the Cubs drop the World Series opener at Wrigley in 1929. He was back in 1932 when Ruth called his shot.\n\n\u201cYes, it really happened,\u201d he said. \u201cMy recollection is still fairly clear about him pointing to the center field scoreboard, which he did.\u201d\n\nStevens served more than 34 years on the Supreme Court and never moved away from rooting for the Cubs.\n\n\u201cAs a Cubs fan, you do a lot of parallel thinking,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have the disappointment, and you always have hope.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Cubs have not won the World Series since 1908, and there's no better indicator of how much has changed around Major League Baseball than their selection as the championship favorite.", "Author": "Ben Walker", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The Cubs have not won the World Series since 1908, and there\u2019s no better indicator of how much has changed around Major League Baseball than their selection as the championship favorite.", "title": "Cubs\u2019 pursuit of World Series again the focus as baseball season gets underway", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/apr/3/cubs-pursuit-world-series-again-focus-baseball/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/04/03/AP_857333822483.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/04/03/AP_857333822483.jpg", "title": "Cubs\u2019 pursuit of World Series again the focus as baseball season", "description": "The Cubs have not won the World Series since 1908, and there's no better indicator of how much has changed around Major League Baseball than their selection as the championship favorite.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Sports, Chicago Cubs, Supreme Court, John Paul Stevens"}, "article_summary": "As a boy, he watched his beloved team play in the very first World Series game at Wrigley Field.\n\u201cWill it happen soon enough?\u201dLet\u2019s begin right there as Major League Baseball gets loosened up for opening day.\nA season after getting swept by the pitching-rich Mets in the National League Championship Series, the Cubs acquired outfielder Jason Heyward, starter John Lackey and second baseman Ben Zobrist.\nA few years after he began listening to their games on radio, Stevens was 9 when he saw the Cubs drop the World Series opener at Wrigley in 1929.\nBryce Harper, Mike Trout, Carlos Correa, Nolan Arenado and Noah Syndergaard among the young, bright stars all over the diamond."}
