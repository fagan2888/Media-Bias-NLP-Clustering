Fully one-fifth of the new enrollment numbers that HHS has been waving around are bogus. Their target for the end of January was 4.4 million sign-ups; a few days ago, they told the country they\u2019d made it three-quarters of the way there with 3.3 million. In reality, once the deadbeats are bounced from the rolls by their new insurers, they\u2019ll be in the ballpark of 2.6 million, or 60 percent of their target. And that\u2019s after HHS pressured insurers to extend the payment deadline from December 31 into January, hoping that a little more time for slackers would pad the enrollment figures even more.\n\nIs it \u201conly\u201d 20 percent who haven\u2019t paid, though, or is the actual number even bigger? The Times is guesstimating based on what they\u2019re being told by different insurers, but read down into the piece and you\u2019ll see that the biggest companies are seeing payment rates below 80 percent \u2014 another detail flagged by Laszewski when he wrote about this a few days ago. Eighty percent is probably the best-case scenario:\n\nMatthew N. Wiggin, a spokesman for Aetna, said that about 70 percent of people who signed up for its health plans paid their premiums. For Aetna policies taking effect on Jan. 1, the deadline for payment was Jan. 14, and for products sold by Coventry Health Care, which is now part of Aetna, the deadline was Jan. 17\u2026 Kristin E. Binns, a vice president of WellPoint, said that 76 percent of people selecting its health plans on an exchange had paid their share of the first month\u2019s premium by the due date of Jan. 31. The company had received more than 500,000 applications for individual coverage through the exchanges in 14 states, she said\u2026 One big company, Humana, said it had received 200,000 applications for insurance through the exchanges. \u201cAbout 75 percent of the people paid, and 25 percent did not pay,\u201d said Thomas T. Noland Jr., a senior vice president there. Customers had until Jan. 31 to pay for coverage that took effect on Jan. 1.\n\nWhat\u2019s the actual payment rate? If it\u2019s 70 percent rather than 80, then suddenly we\u2019re very close to HHS being only halfway to their 4.4 million target at this point.\n\nAt least one insurer has now extended the December 31 deadline for premiums to February 15 to delay having to cull their new ObamaCare-friendly consumer base for as long as possible. Note this bit too:\n\nMark T. Bertolini, the chief executive of Aetna, said last week that the company had 135,000 \u201cpaid members,\u201d out of 200,000 who began to enroll through the exchanges. \u201cI think people are enrolling in multiple places,\u201d he said in a conference call. \u201cThey are shopping. And what happens is that they never really get back on HealthCare.gov to disenroll from plans they prior enrolled in.\u201d\n\nIn other words, John Smith signs up for Aetna\u2019s coverage on Healthcare.gov but waits before paying his first premium; then he sees a cheaper plan at Humana and signs up directly with that company, making his first payment on time. He\u2019s paid up \u2014 but he\u2019s still on the books at Aetna as a deadbeat. Or maybe he signs up for a different Aetna plan than he originally chose, leaving him with two separate accounts at Aetna and paid up on only one of them. However you slice it, there are bogus \u201cenrollments\u201d being counted by HHS that are going to end up being canceled soon. How many?\n\nHere\u2019s another data point from my pal Karl. Ask the state exchanges what sort of payment rates they\u2019re seeing and some will tell you it\u2019s a lot lower than 80 percent:\n\nWashington and Wisconsin have reported that barely half of those signing up submitted payments. But the paying portion is 66% in Nevada, 80% in Vermont and 85% in Rhode Island. Even if 85% were the national average, though, it would still cut ObamaCare\u2019s paid enrollment by a half million to 2.8 million vs. a March 31 goal of 7 million. It\u2019s possible that paid enrollees represent an even costlier patient population than the updated national sign-up figures suggest.\n\nThat last bit is an excellent point. If you had to guess what sort of enrollee would be scrupulous about getting his first premium in on time, what would you guess? Would it be the \u201cyoung healthy\u201d who signed up on Healthcare.gov in December to keep his options open but who\u2019s ambivalent about popping for coverage this year because he\u2019s not earning much? Or would it be someone who knows they\u2019ll need expensive medical treatment this year and wants to be absolutely certain that their coverage is in effect? In other words, not only are insurers going to have to thin their risk-pool herd for nonpayment, but it may be that young adults \u2014 the most prized of all enrollees \u2014 are a disproportionately large segment among the deadbeats. Which means the looming adverse selection problem is about to get worse, not better.\n\nOh, and by the way: The website still isn\u2019t working for some people. Thus concludes HHS\u2019s week of enrollment glory.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Deadbeats.", "title": "Insurers: At least 20% of new ObamaCare sign-ups failed to pay their first premium on time", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/02/14/insurers-at-least-20-of-new-obamacare-sign-ups-failed-to-pay-their-first-premium-on-time/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "keywords": "Department of Health and Human Services, enrollment, insurance, insurers, nonpayment, ObamaCare, premium, sign up,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-14T16:21:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-14T16:11:12+00:00"}, "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd839\"", "article_summary": "Insurers: At least 20% of new ObamaCare sign-ups failed to pay their first premium on timeposted at 11:21 am on February 14, 2014 by AllahpunditSo Bob Laszewski was right.\nCustomers had until Jan. 31 to pay for coverage that took effect on Jan. 1.\nIs it \u201conly\u201d 20 percent who haven\u2019t paid, though, or is the actual number even bigger?\n\u201cAbout 75 percent of the people paid, and 25 percent did not pay,\u201d said Thomas T.
