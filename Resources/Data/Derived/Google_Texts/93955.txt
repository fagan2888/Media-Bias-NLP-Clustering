Just a week away from election day, polls show Governor Terry Branstad has a double-digit lead over Democratic State Senator Jack Hatch.

Ben Kieffer talks with State Senator Jack Hatch

Branstad is seeking an unprecedented sixth term as governor of the state, but Hatch says he’s the superior candidate because his goals for the state are lofty.

“If you’re going to have to be a Governor, you’re going to have to lead… My campaign is about the know how to do what others think is impossible.”

Jack Hatch’s Top Three Legislative Priorities: 1) Education – Hatch says he wants preschool for all 4 year olds. He also wants to focus on improving high school graduation rates and improving leadership for Iowa’s community colleges. He would also work to lock in tuition rates for students at Iowa's regent universities. 2) Tax cuts for the middle class – Hatch says he wants to raise the tax credit for having a child from $40 to more than $500 per child. 3) Focus on economic development – Hatch says he wants to create a statewide economic development board that would have directors for each of Iowa’s Congressional Districts.

During this conversation with Iowa Public Radio’s Ben Kieffer, Hatch says he’d like to expand renewable energy, increase the minimum wage and continue to improve upon the Affordable Care Act and how its policies serve Iowans.
