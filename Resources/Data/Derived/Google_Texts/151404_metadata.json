The trend is particularly evident in the field of anesthesiology, in which smaller groups are quickly realizing the benefits of bigger buyers, including collective bargaining power. Anesthesiologists are also influencing M&A among innovative drug makers. (For more, see the video Regulation Drives M&A, Especially in Health Care.)\n\nAs a sign of heightened interest in the medical specialty, investment bank Cross Keys Capital has six anesthesiology practice clients currently under letters of intent with a variety of suitors, plus another six privately held anesthesiology practices on the auction block. The practices are feeling pressure from insurers such as Aetna Inc. (NYSE: AET) and Blue Cross Blue Shield over the lowering of reimbursement rates, explains Cross Key co-founder Bill Britton. Now more than ever, smaller companies are welcoming Mednax (NYSE: MD), TeamHealth (NYSE: TMH) and AmSurg Corp. (Nasdaq: AMSG) as suitors.\n\nLarger groups are in a stronger position to negotiate higher fees with insurance companies, Britton says. They can push for their higher rates over some of the lower reimbursements that companies such as Mosaic Anesthesia & Perioperative Services PC and Memac Associates PC might have received as stand-alone entities in the past. Mednax bought both companies earlier in 2015.\n\nAs hospitals look to cut costs, anesthesia stands out as a service that can't be outsourced to offsite third parties, because anesthesiologists need to be present in operating rooms. Advancements in the field can create attractive assets. If physicians consider a new anesthetic a hit, the company that makes it could become a desirable target.\n\nThe Medicines Co. (Nasdaq: MDCO) bought all of the shares of Annovation Biopharma that it didn't already own. The goal was to gain exclusive rights to a new anesthetic that may help patients wake up more safely after surgery.\n\nFor private equity investors, the early returns on anesthesiologist groups have been favorable, according to Jeff Swearingen, co-founder of Edgemont Capital Partners LP. Swearingen says early exits from private equity firms have been successful, including MTS Health Investors' sale of portfolio company Florida Gulf-to-Bay Anesthesiology Associates to TeamHealth.\n\nFor more information on related topics, visit the following:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.themiddlemarket.com/news/strategic_m_a/the-buyside-buyers-wake-up-to-anesthesiology-255976-1.html", "image": "http://cdn.themiddlemarket.com/media/newspics/anesthesiology_snippet.jpg", "site_name": "Mergers & Acquisitions, Latest News", "title": "The Buyside: Buyers Wake Up to Anesthesiology"}}, "article_summary": "Now more than ever, smaller companies are welcoming Mednax (NYSE: MD), TeamHealth (NYSE: TMH) and AmSurg Corp.
