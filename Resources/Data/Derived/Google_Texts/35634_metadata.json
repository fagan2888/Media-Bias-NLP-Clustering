If you\u2019ve never done that, you might be surprised at all the jargon you\u2019re supposed to know. And if you\u2019ve waited until the last minute to enroll \u2014 most people have until March 31 to sign up and dodge the fine, it\u2019s time to start cramming.\n\nIt turns out many of us are barely literate when it comes to health insurance and the Affordable Care Act. A new study published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences finds 42 percent of people could not accurately define the term \"deductible,\" and that\u2019s kind of an easy one. Lower-income people, whom health care reform is supposed to help, answered just four out of 11 questions right about the law.\n\nThe jargon isn\u2019t just off-putting; it\u2019s also crucial to understanding how much a plan really costs. If you\u2019re shopping for a plan based just on the monthly bill, you could be missing a whole bunch of information you need in order to figure out what you can afford.\n\nThat means getting familiar with than just premiums, but also copayment and coinsurance, bronze levels and, my favorite, the drug formulary. If you want to be boring, you can get all this information from a glossary published by HealthCare.gov. Or you can have a little fun checking out our handy annotated graphic above.\n\nBetter yet, print out the PDF version and tack to your workspace for easy reference.\n\nStill better, click the \u201clisten\u201d link above to hear the audio version, complete with radio footnotes, before printing up the cheat sheet.
