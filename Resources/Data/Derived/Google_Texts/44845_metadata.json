It was more than enough to keep the Carolina Panthers perfect for the season.\n\nNewton completed his first 11 passes \u2014 the longest streak of his career \u2014 and undefeated Carolina shut out Tennessee in the second half of a 27-10 victory on Sunday.\n\nNewton ran for a touchdown and passed for another score as the Panthers (9-0) extended their league-best winning streak to 13 games. Next up is a visit from Washington next Sunday.\n\nNewton said he thought it could be a \u201ctrap game\u201d against the Titans, who were coming off a win over New Orleans.\n\n\u201cThe stakes were high and they\u2019re going to get higher each and every week,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know we\u2019re going to get teams\u2019 best.\u201d\n\nAfter sloppy finishes in their last two wins over the Colts and Packers, the Panthers outscored the Titans 13-0 in the second half.\n\nCarolina\u2019s defense allowed only 11 first downs and capped the dominating performance by forcing a fumble on Tennessee\u2019s final possession.\n\n\u201cThat was awesome,\u201d said Carolina coach Ron Rivera, adding he was happy the defense kept up the pressure throughout the game.\n\nThe Titans (2-7) suffered their 10th straight home loss in the first home game under interim coach Mike Mularkey.\n\nNewton completed 21 of 26 passes for 217 yards. His strong start included a 1-yard scoring pass to Ed Dickson early in the second quarter.\n\nNewton said the secret for opening the game with 11 straight completions was \u201cclear weather.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe last couple games we\u2019ve been playing in tsunamis and things like that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had a beautiful game in Nashville today. We had to make the most of it.\u201d\n\nNewton\u2019s longest streak had been 10 completions. He added 23 yards rushing, including a clinching 2-yard TD with 2:42 left.\n\nMularkey said Carolina wins with strong defense, especially when paired with an offense that had no turnovers.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re just efficient,\u201d Mularkey said. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be 500 yards of offense and 40 points. It\u2019s possess the football and wear you down eventually. \u2026 Eventually the dam is going to break.\u201d\n\nCarolina led 14-10 at halftime. The Panthers padded the lead on Graham Gano\u2019s field goals of 48 and 19 yards and Newton\u2019s touchdown run.\n\nTennessee rookie Marcus Mariota was 16 for 24 for 185 yards and an interception. The Titans had only one first down in the second half until their final possession, which ended with a catch and lost fumble by Dexter McCluster.\n\nThe Titans converted only 5 of 12 third downs.\n\n\u201cWe knew coming in it was going to be a tough battle but we left a lot of points out there,\u201d Mariota said.\n\nCarolina\u2019s Jonathan Stewart had 22 carries for 91 yards, including a 16-yard touchdown run in the first quarter. Tight end Greg Olsen had eight catches \u2014 on eight targets \u2014 for 80 yards.\n\nOlsen had a one-handed catch in the second half, but he said Newton\u2019s accuracy made his job easy.\n\n\u201cFor the most part, everything was at your hands,\u201d Olsen said. \u201cEven if you had to go down and get it, it was super catchable, super easy and friendly balls.\u201d\n\nThe Titans turned up the heat on their pass rush on Newton to open the second half. After having only one sack in the first half, the defense recorded sacks on three straight plays on Carolina\u2019s first possession after halftime.\n\nCarolina\u2019s defense was even stronger. The Titans were held to 19 yards and one first down in the third quarter, and they never regained the momentum they showed early in the game when Mariota was effective as a runner and passer.\n\nThe Titans played with a short-handed secondary. Starting cornerbacks Perrish Cox and Jason McCourty were inactive due to injuries. Bidi Wreh-Wilson, who started for Cox, left early in the second half with a hamstring injury.\n\nNOTES: Tennessee wide receiver Justin Hunter was carted off the field with an apparent right ankle injury late in the game. \u2026 Mularkey said he had no details about Hunter\u2019s injury but said \u201cIt\u2019s not good.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Cam Newton\u2019s hot start helps unbeaten Panthers top Titans", "title": "Cam Newton\u2019s hot start helps unbeaten Panthers top Titans", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/11/15/cam-newtons-hot-start-helps-unbeaten-panthers-top-titans/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151115_043246_cam-newton.jpg", "height": 476}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151115_043246_cam-newton.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-15T16:36:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-20T03:10:16+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Olsen had a one-handed catch in the second half, but he said Newton\u2019s accuracy made his job easy.\nIt was more than enough to keep the Carolina Panthers perfect for the season.\nBidi Wreh-Wilson, who started for Cox, left early in the second half with a hamstring injury.\nThe Titans had only one first down in the second half until their final possession, which ended with a catch and lost fumble by Dexter McCluster.\nThe Panthers padded the lead on Graham Gano\u2019s field goals of 48 and 19 yards and Newton\u2019s touchdown run."}
