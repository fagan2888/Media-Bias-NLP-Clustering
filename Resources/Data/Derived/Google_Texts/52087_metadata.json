The event emphasized the U.S. government\u2019s imperative to \u201cbreak barriers\u201d to post-rape care in countries plagued by warfare.\n\nSexual assault in conflict zones has come under increasing scrutiny over the past few years, particularly after hundreds of Syrian refugees cited rape as one of the primary reasons they fled their country in 2013.\n\nHowever, the president\u2019s current approach to international aid prevents many of those sexual assault victims from receiving any information or assistance related to abortion. Reproductive rights advocates argue that the Obama administration\u2019s narrow interpretation of the Helms Amendment \u2014 a decades-old policy that prohibits federal assistance from funding abortion services abroad \u2014 has essentially resulted in a \u201cgag order\u201d about medical information related to the procedure.\n\nEven though Helms technically has exceptions for women who become pregnant as a result of rape or incest, they\u2019re not necessarily utilized in practice. Health workers abroad are confused about what exactly they\u2019re allowed to do under the policy, and they\u2019re too concerned about breaking the law and losing all their funding. It\u2019s easier to avoid abortion altogether.\n\nThat\u2019s why a diverse coalition of groups is seeking to pressure President Obama to issue an executive action to clarify how health workers should interpret Helms. They\u2019re not asking for the policy to be completely repealed yet; instead, they\u2019re simply demanding that the White House enforce its exceptions accurately so that victims of rape aren\u2019t denied access to reproductive health care.\n\nOver the past year, groups like Planned Parenthood, Human Rights Watch, and the Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice have all grown more vocal about the need to reform Helms. They\u2019ve penned letters to the White House about the issue, as well as published op-eds and blog posts on the issue. And in March, global health leaders called for clarification about Helm\u2019s exceptions as the first step in preventing women from dying from unsafe abortions around the world.\n\n\u201cGroups from all over the world are gathering to make their voices heard so that we can finally open the doors to comprehensive health care for these women,\u201d Serra Sippel, the president of the Center for Health and Gender Equity (CHANGE), said in a statement regarding Tuesday\u2019s White House rally.\n\nMultiple surveys have shown that Americans overwhelmingly support abortion access for rape victims, and many of them specifically favor enforcing the Helms Amendment the way it was written. According to a national poll conducted earlier this year by Lake Research Partners on behalf of CHANGE, nearly 60 percent of respondents agreed that President Obama \u201cshould issue an executive order to allow foreign assistance to support comprehensive health care, including safe abortions for women in the cases of rape, incest, and when a woman\u2019s life is in danger.\u201d\n\nThere have been other examples of progress in this area recently. Last year, Congress slightly loosened the abortion coverage ban for women serving in the military, so that female service members who have been raped can now use their insurance to end a pregnancy. Lawmakers have also recently advanced a measure to extend the same type of abortion coverage to Peace Corps volunteers who become pregnant from sexual assault.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "More than 20 organizations are pressuring the president to revise a decades-old policy that blocks women abroad from getting the full range of reproductive health care.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "More than 20 organizations are pressuring the president to revise a decades-old policy that blocks women abroad from getting the full range of reproductive health care.", "title": "White House Protesters Demand Abortion Access For Women Raped In Conflict", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/12/09/3601194/abortion-rape-conflict-helms/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/rape-conflict.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "More than 20 organizations are pressuring the president to revise a decades-old policy that blocks women abroad from getting the full range of reproductive health care.", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/rape-conflict-321x214.jpg", "title": "White House Protesters Demand Abortion Access For Women Raped In Conflict", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/rape-conflict.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/rape-conflict.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-09T12:48:27+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd89d\"", "article_summary": "They\u2019ve penned letters to the White House about the issue, as well as published op-eds and blog posts on the issue.\nHealth White House Protesters Demand Abortion Access For Women Raped In Conflict CREDIT: The Center for Health and Gender Equity (CHANGE)Representatives from more than 20 organizations are rallying in front of the White House on Tuesday to pressure President Obama to ensure the full range of reproductive health services \u2014 including abortion \u2014 for women around the world who become pregnant from rape.\nThey\u2019re not asking for the policy to be completely repealed yet; instead, they\u2019re simply demanding that the White House enforce its exceptions accurately so that victims of rape aren\u2019t denied access to reproductive health care.\nEven though Helms technically has exceptions for women who become pregnant as a result of rape or incest, they\u2019re not necessarily utilized in practice.\nHowever, the president\u2019s current approach to international aid prevents many of those sexual assault victims from receiving any information or assistance related to abortion."}
