So what exactly are you getting if you are doing only that one particular routine \u2014 and what are you missing out on?\n\nWe asked fitness experts to guide us through popular fitness routines \u2014 their upsides, their limitations and what you might add to round out your program.\n\nBarre\n\nUsing a ballet barre for balance, you perform small ballet-inspired movements and static poses that provide isometric training.\n\n\u201cA barre class offers a nice combination of balance and coordination,\u201d says Anthony Wall, director of professional education for the American Council on Exercise. \u201cIt works postural muscles, which improves stability.\u201d\n\nWhat to add: A barre class is unlikely to improve external-load-bearing strength (as free weights do) or aerobic fitness. \u201cSo you might add kayaking or hiking for that aerobic component,\u201d Wall says.\n\nInsanity\n\nA high-intensity interval body-weight class such as Insanity or P90X (both branded products) usually lasts up to 30 minutes and features drills that drive the heart rate into an anaerobic zone \u2014 more than 80 percent of maximum heart rate. Gold\u2019s gym uses a version called Grit.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very efficient and includes agility, speed, dynamic jumping and strength,\u201d says Linda Haupt, regional group fitness director for Gold\u2019s Gym on the East Coast. The post-exercise fat burn is higher and longer than after aerobic exercise.\n\nWhat to add: You\u2019re not getting much aerobic work with high-intensity intervals, so adding running, cycling or swimming would be a good complement, or some external load bearing, such as free weights.\n\nCrossFit\n\nCrossFit is a brand that features high-intensity intervals but, unlike Insanity, also uses external loading.\n\n\u201cWith the high intensity, you are improving your cardiovascular system,\u201d Wall says, and the external load bearing improves strength. Other benefits include weight loss and, maybe most important, the social aspect \u2014 the feeling of being part of something larger.\n\nWhat to add: Haupt suggests incorporating some mobility and stability work, maybe through yoga. Wall recommends adding an aerobic component.\n\nIndoor cycling\n\nIndoor cycling can mean long-distance, steady-state drills, which can be an excellent way to build aerobic capacity. But the most popular format focuses on short, high-intensity intervals \u2014 in other words, anaerobic work. Like CrossFit, it helps improve the cardiovascular system and encourages weight loss. It also strengthens the legs.\n\nWhat to add: Wall suggests adding something like boxing to strengthen the upper body and core as well as to work on rotating the body to complement the static body position on a bike.\n\nZumba\n\nLike CrossFit, Zumba has a social component that encourages participants to keep coming back. And like any dance-based routine, it improves coordination and balance.\n\nWhat to add: Haupt suggests adding a strength component, particularly for the upper body, and additional stretching for the lower body, including hips. Yoga or Pilates could fit the bill.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2014/11/hffit04.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "article_summary": "What to add: Haupt suggests adding a strength component, particularly for the upper body, and additional stretching for the lower body, including hips.\n\u201cIt works postural muscles, which improves stability.\u201dWhat to add: A barre class is unlikely to improve external-load-bearing strength (as free weights do) or aerobic fitness.\n\u201cSo you might add kayaking or hiking for that aerobic component,\u201d Wall says.\nWhat to add: Wall suggests adding something like boxing to strengthen the upper body and core as well as to work on rotating the body to complement the static body position on a bike.\nWe asked fitness experts to guide us through popular fitness routines \u2014 their upsides, their limitations and what you might add to round out your program."}
