But Krugman\u2019s been looking askance at Sanders\u2019 campaign for a while now, and his gripe \u2014 that Sanders\u2019 campaign promises are unrealistic on both political and policy grounds \u2014 has been consistent throughout.\n\nAs you might imagine, though, many left-wing tweeters couldn\u2019t care less about Krugman\u2019s earnestness. They think he\u2019s just another elite wagon-circler. They\u2019re pissed:\n\nKrugman likes his Democrats comfortably establishment https://t.co/R79n65sGg7 \u2014 Michael Hoexter (@mike_cal) January 22, 2016\n\nKrugman writes an article on how political change happens where the only numbers cited are dates https://t.co/nUxTsBey1y \u2014 Ethan Gatch (@ethangach) January 22, 2016\n\nKrugman: \"I must use my massively privilege op-ed space to concede to the status quo once again!\" https://t.co/amtth3L8Vp \u2014 holly wood (@girlziplocked) January 22, 2016\n\n@NYTimeskrugman Krugman must be promised a position in an HRC administration. Sounding her trumpet pretty loudly these days. \u2014 ShitGranGranthamSays (@SGGranthamSays) January 22, 2016\n\nSome Experts, Like Krugman, Supported Single Payer Until Bernie Sanders Put It in His Platform #NakedCapitalism https://t.co/aUQiboHR4c \u2014 Jonathan Cohn (@JonathanCohn) January 22, 2016\n\nThat last tweet links to this post from Yves Smith at Naked Capitalism. It\u2019s a series of quotes from center-left pundits and politicians, all of whom express their support \u2014 in the abstract \u2014 for a single-payer model of national health insurance. The most recent quote is from 2011. The oldest is from 2003. Except for a short note at the top, claiming the post is an example of \u201cres ipsa loquitur,\u201d Smith herself provides no commentary or analysis.\n\nAs you probably guessed when you saw the list of tweets, I\u2019m going to ask you to allow me to indulge in a bit of a generalization. Namely, that a lot of Krugman\u2019s left-wing critics think he\u2019s somehow changing his tune. They\u2019re wrong, and I\u2019ll explain why in a moment. But first I\u2019ll take a swipe at re-creating their (quite reasonable) thought process.\n\nThey remember how critical Krugman was of candidate Obama in the 2008 primary; and they remember that he was the \u201canti-Obama\u201d during the president\u2019s first few years in office. But they also remember that Krugman ultimately came to write an influential Rolling Stone piece in the president\u2019s defense. They believe that the Democratic Party establishment is in the tank for Hillary Clinton, Sanders\u2019 chief opponent. They figure Krugman, now firmly back in the establishment\u2019s clutches, is following suit.\n\nAgain, it\u2019s not a wild or outrageous narrative. It doesn\u2019t require imagining Krugman is part of a coordinated campaign, devised in some dark and shadowy conference room \u2014 perhaps the one the Springfield Republican Party uses \u2014 with elevating Clinton, and thwarting Sanders, as its goal. But it\u2019s still wrong; and it misremembers (or misrepresents) not only Krugman\u2019s positions in the past and today, but also, by proxy, the position of Sanders-skeptic lefties in general.\n\nBut before I attempt to expand this in a way that makes it relevant to people besides Paul Krugman and Angry Person On Twitter, let\u2019s start with Mr. Nobel Prize-winner and why charges of hypocrisy or selling out are mistaken.\n\nTo be blunt, there is no contradiction in thinking single-payer is a better model while simultaneously thinking that making it a central part of the 2016 presidential campaign is tilting at windmills. Human beings are capable of wishing the world were a certain way but recognizing it\u2019s another way \u2014 and acting accordingly. This is not something that only unprincipled, hack, establishment, D.C. insider, yadda-yadda-yadda villains do. It\u2019s a thing that people do. Bernie \u201creparations are too divisive\u201d Sanders has done it before. I\u2019d imagine that, before this campaign is over, he\u2019ll do it again.\n\nThe second attack \u2014 that Krugman started to like Obama only once the latter had become a part of the establishment himself \u2014 is nearly as off the mark. It\u2019s true that Krugman has become much more friendly toward Obama over the past eight or so years. I remember well how he was one of the few liberals with the temerity to grumble about parliamentary trench warfare and Republican intransigence when everyone else just wanted to drift in the warm waters of Hope and Change. But the reason Krugman is now one of Obama\u2019s chief defenders isn\u2019t because he changed. It\u2019s because Obama did.", "article_metadata": {"description": "America's most influential pundit has been critical of the Vermont socialist.
