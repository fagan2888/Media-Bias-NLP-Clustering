As the Washington Post reports, Burger King would \u201cmove the company\u2019s headquarters to Canada, where corporate taxes are significantly lower.\u201d\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nThis process, called inversion, has been occurring more and more often, despite the fascistic suggestion by President Obama that headquartering outside the United States represents a betrayal of God and country. Members of the Obama administration have taken to labeling business inversions a lack of \u201ceconomic patriotism\u201d \u2013 presumably under the assumption that to stay in America, cut jobs, and lose all profits in order to pay higher taxes represents a sort of higher moral value than moving one\u2019s headquarters and continuing to pay millions of workers and reward consumers with better and cheaper products.\n\nThe Obama administration ought to note that the Soviets built a wall in the center of Berlin to keep their people and industries \u201ceconomically patriotic.\u201d Suggested measures to chain companies to the United States represent the same sort of government compulsion. And that sort of compulsion is a heavy club for a very slight increase in government revenue: an estimated $19 billion over 10 years.\n\nSadly, the Obama administration\u2019s policies have driven more and more industries out of the country. Since 2008, more than two dozen companies have taken advantage of inversion. Here are seven other companies that have shifted production out of America in order to avoid our ridiculous regulatory schemes, or are considering the possibility of doing so:\n\nWalgreens. Walgreens seriously considered inversion this month, but walked away from moving its headquarters to Europe after purchasing Alliance Boots GmbH. That decision drove Walgreens stock down. Walgreens\u2019 board only decided against inversion, according to the Wall Street Journal, because \u201cthe board felt that the arrangement might not easily pass muster with the Internal Revenue Service and created the potential to be hung up in litigation for a decade.\u201d\n\nPfizer. The pharmaceutical giant has been in on-again, off-again talks to buy Britain\u2019s AstraZeneca in order to take part in a tax inversion. In May, Pfizer walked away from a deal to buy AstraZeneca for some $118 billion \u2013 but now, the deal is reportedly back on the table. According to Reuters five days ago:\n\nPfizer Chief Executive Ian Read has made clear he is still considering big deals to revive his firm\u2019s pipeline and cut its tax bill \u2013 something buying AstraZeneca would allow it to do via a so-called inversion that would shift its tax base to Britain.\n\nShould AstraZeneca not become part of the deal, other companies, like GlaxoSmithKline, could.\n\nMedtronic. Medtronic, a huge medical technology firm, has acquired Covidien, and will adopt Ireland as its legal headquarters. As the Wall Street Journal reports, here is the deal: \u201cMedtronic agrees to call Ireland its legal home, and in return it gets to bring $1 billion or more into the U.S. without penalty.\u201d The deal was for some $43 billion.\n\nTim Hortons. The company Burger King now seeks to buy participated in what is called a \u201cnaked inversion\u201d itself in 2009. It started off as a Canadian company, according to the Congressional Research Service, but was bought by Wendy\u2019s in 1995, then went independent in 2006.\n\nLiberty Global. In 2013, Liberty Global bought Virgin Media for $23.3 billion. The merger, according to BBC, created \u201cthe second biggest pay-TV business after BSkyB\u201d as well as \u201cthe world\u2019s largest broadband company, with 25 million customers in 14 countries.\u201d Most of the company\u2019s revenue was earned in Europe. Richard Branson, previous owner of Virgin Media, became a 2 percent stakeholder in the new entity. Upon inverting, the tax rate for Liberty Global dropped to 21 percent, and the company was exempted from taxes for several years, according to the American Bar Association.\n\nChiquita Brands. Just this month, Chiquita participated in an inversion deal, buying Fyffes of Ireland and relocating its headquarters there. The company stated, \u201cChiquita remains committed to completing its transaction with Fyffes, which it believes will create a combined company that is better positioned to succeed in a highly competitive marketplace while driving strong performance and value for shareholders.\u201d\n\nEaton. When Eaton bought Cooper Industries and headquartered in Ireland, Eaton saved approximately $160 million on taxes. The companies explained, \u201cIncorporating as an Irish company provides significant global cash management flexibility and associated financial benefits.\u201d As Bloomberg News noted:\n\nEaton\u2019s effective tax rate for 2011 was 12.9 percent and its rate for 2010 was 9.5 percent, according to company filings. In 2011, lower taxes on its non-U.S. operations made up more than half of the difference between the company\u2019s effective tax rate and the 35 percent top U.S. rate.\n\nOverall, some 25 major companies have participated in tax inversions since President Obama took office. That trend will continue to accelerate as President Obama ratchets up the rhetoric and threatens harsher action against companies that dare to buck his high-tax priorities.\n\nBen Shapiro is Senior Editor-At-Large of Breitbart News and author of the new book, The People vs. Barack Obama: The Criminal Case Against The Obama Administration (Threshold Editions, June 10, 2014).
