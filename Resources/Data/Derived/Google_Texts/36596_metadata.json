Four Price \u2014 who initially proposed restoring $75 million in Medicaid funding for rural hospitals before House and Senate negotiators settled on $58 million \u2014 said the plight of the rural hospitals is worrisome.\n\n\u201cIt is very concerning to me mainly because of the environment the rural hospitals have to operate in,\u201d said Price, chairman of a House Appropriations subcommittee that deals with health care funding.\n\n\u201cIf it was just a matter of slow payments and they had other payment streams available to them, or they had a different patient mix, or more populated urban areas that sort of offsets the cash flow issues \u2026 I guess that would be less concerning,\u201d Price, R-Amarillo, said. \u201cBut the environment in which they operate is very concerning to me because they have such a high population of patients who are either uninsured or indigent.\u201d\n\nAlthough it is early to say what the Legislature can do during the interim, some of the possibilities include putting pressure on Congress and holding public hearings to figure out other possible solutions, Price said.\n\nMcBeath said the executives of some the rural hospitals thought that when the Legislature restored the $58 million in Medicaid funding their financial woes would be over for a while.\n\nBut since the state\u2019s next fiscal biennium begins Sept. 1, this means the Medicaid reimbursements may not come until October or November, McBeath said.\n\nMoreover, \u201cstate dollars only cover about a third of the cuts,\u201d he stressed. \u201cTexas has tried to do its part but Congress needs to do its part.\u201d\n\nenrique.rangel@morris.com\n\n\u2022 (512) 673-7553", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Filed online, Local News, Enrique Rangel", "og": {"site_name": "Lubbock Online | Lubbock Avalanche-Journal", "description": "AUSTIN - The financial troubles Texas rural hospitals have experienced during the past four years may not be over after all.", "title": "Leaders say federal help needed as some Texas rural hospitals remain on 'brink of closure'", "url": "http://lubbockonline.com/filed-online/2015-08-08/leaders-say-federal-help-needed-some-texas-rural-hospitals-remain-brink", "image": "http://lubbockonline.com/sites/default/files/14228355_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "AUSTIN \u2014 The financial troubles Texas rural hospitals have experienced during the past four years may not be over after all.Two months after the Texas Legislature restored most of the Medicaid funding cuts made in the 2011 session \u2014 when lawmakers tackled a $27 billion shortfall \u2014 the Texas Organization of Rural and Community Hospitals says \u201crural hospitals remain in financial distress and more could be on the brink of closure.\u201d"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc1a4\"", "article_summary": "AUSTIN \u2014 The financial troubles Texas rural hospitals have experienced during the past four years may not be over after all.\n\u201cThirteen Texas rural hospitals have closed since January 2013 and a similar number could be padlocking their doors in the next year if these hospitals don\u2019t see their full payments restored,\u201d warned CEO David Pearson.\nMore than 50 rural hospitals have closed since 2010 and the majority of those health care facilities were in Texas and other Southern states, according to the National Rural Health Association.\nState Rep.
