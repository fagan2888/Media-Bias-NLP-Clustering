One night last week, our cantor, one of our rabbis, a couple of musicians and I went next door for their Chanukah party, which consisted of songs, candle lighting, and a dinner (which was, in large part, provided by generous donations from local merchants).\n\nThe community center was packed, with all the seats taken and several of us standing in the back. Some of the residents who participated were Jewish, but a good number of them were not. It was, I thought, a great way to share our tradition with those who grew up with it as well as those who had not.\n\nThen, at the dinner, the woman sitting next to me asked, \u201cYou\u2019re the president of the synagogue?\u201d I told her I am, and she said, \u201cYou\u2019re not a rabbi?\u201d I said no, and she followed up with, \u201cSo what do you do as president?\u201d I explained that I am president of the Board of Directors, which oversees the finances of the synagogue, sets policy, and is responsible for the vision.\n\nShe then asked, \u201cDid you approve that big sign you had out front?\u201d I asked her what sign she was talking about, and as she described it I realized she was referring to the sign we have which says, \u201cKol yisrael arevim zeh bazeh,/All Jews are responsible for one another/We stand as one with Israel/Learn more. Act more.\u201d I told her the Board doesn\u2019t approve signs; that is something the staff takes care of.\n\nShe said, \u201cThey would never get away with something like that in front of a Catholic church.\u201d I asked her what she meant by \u201cget away with\u201d it. She explained, \u201cPutting up a political sign.\u201d I put down my forkful of latke.\n\nI told her, \u201cAll Jews are responsible for one another\u201d is an old Jewish saying. It isn\u2019t political.\u201d\n\nShe clarified, \u201cThat sign was up during the Gaza war. It isn\u2019t right to say all Jews support Israel. A lot of Jews don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nI replied, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean we agree with everything the current government in Israel does, but we do believe Israel has a right to defend itself.\u201d\n\nGaining steam, she countered, \u201cThey did a lot more than defend themselves. You should read the progressive media reports about what was going on.\u201d\n\nAt this point, I was having a hard time believing I was having this conversation at a Chanukah party dinner. I didn\u2019t come there prepared to defend Israel. I read a lot of reports during the war, both \u201cprogressive\u201d and otherwise. I find it a bit sad that she would think it would be impossible for someone to read those reports and not still stand with Israel. I wondered whether she had read anything from Israel\u2019s point of view. But, I suppose, with the amount of disinformation swirling around social media and elsewhere, one who supports Israel should always be prepared to defend her.\n\nPart of me thought, \u201cMy father and his family had to flee Hungary. She has no idea what it means to me to know there is a safe place Jews can go when they\u2019re persecuted.\u201d Part of me thought, \u201cI have friends, we have congregants, who have children who served in the Israeli Defense Forces and risked their lives for Israel during that war.\u201d But I knew nothing I said would make her change her mind. I knew by her tone and her body language that she was convinced Israel was in the wrong and she had no interest in hearing any other point of view.\n\nSo what I said to her was, \u201cThe sign represents what our synagogue stands for. I don\u2019t want to talk politics.\u201d She said she agreed she didn\u2019t want to talk politics either, and I turned and chatted with others at the table for the rest of the meal.\n\n----------------\n\n\"Like\u201d the Religious and Reform Facebook page to see additional photos and behind-the-scenes comments, and https://twitter.com/SusanBarnesRnR on Twitter.\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nView our privacy policy and terms of service.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.jewishjournal.com/religiousandreform/item/criticized_for_standing_with_israel", "type": "article", "image": "http://www.jewishjournal.com/images/bloggers/All_Jews_are_Responsible_for_One_Another_crop.jpg", "site_name": "Jewish Journal", "title": "Criticized for Standing with Israel | Religious and Reform"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 23102350, "title": "Criticized for Standing with Israel | Religious and Reform", "url": "http://www.jewishjournal.com/religiousandreform/item/criticized_for_standing_with_israel", "image": "http://www.jewishjournal.com/images/bloggers/All_Jews_are_Responsible_for_One_Another_crop.jpg", "site": "@jewishjournal", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "1439B350A4269424970C93B18CEAF6FB", "fb": {"app_id": 216180581861512}, "keywords": "Jewish Journal, news, jewish, israel, los angeles, Tribe Media Corp, Hollywood, Israel, jewish, judaism, world, nation", "verify-v1": "5CqSOVc2kyARWwZMAxu3QCpMoZGbB5Nu6xIPWK5MXvQ="}, "article_summary": "I didn\u2019t come there prepared to defend Israel.\nThe community center was packed, with all the seats taken and several of us standing in the back.\nIt isn\u2019t right to say all Jews support Israel.\nBut, I suppose, with the amount of disinformation swirling around social media and elsewhere, one who supports Israel should always be prepared to defend her.\nI find it a bit sad that she would think it would be impossible for someone to read those reports and not still stand with Israel."}
