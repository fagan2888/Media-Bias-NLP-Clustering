The Walter Brewing Co. said Monday it plans to revive the storied brand made in Pueblo from 1889 to the mid-70s.

The brewery, which will operate in downtown Pueblo on Oneida Ave., plans to launch a product called First Season in the fall, followed by a revival of the traditional Walterâ€™s Pilsner.

The brewer will employ 12 people producing classic Walter lines along with craft beers. It will have a tasting room and provide tours to the public.
