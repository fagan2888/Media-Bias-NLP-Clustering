It was illegal under civil rights laws to fire someone for being black or a woman or a Mormon, I noted. On the other hand: \u201cFiring, or not hiring, someone because he is overweight, ugly, a \u2018Star Wars\u2019 fanatic or a graduate of a non-Ivy League college is not illegal. Yet I have no doubt that members of these groups are the victims of at least occasional discrimination.\u201d\n\nNow we can add another category of employee who is unprotected by civil rights laws: Fans of the TV show \u201cMy Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic.\u201d Gawker reported the other day about the dismissal from his job of a man in his 30s known only as \u201cFiredBrony.\u201d A Brony is a fan of the animated series, and, as The Times reported last year, not all Bronies are little girls.\n\nWe don\u2019t know FiredBrony\u2019s real name. According to Gawker, he\u2019s a late-30s father of one who attracted the suspicion of his boss when he chose an image of a pony called Applejack as his desktop computer background. Then came Take Your Child to Work Day. As FiredBrony recalls it:\n\n\u201cMy boss' daughter is 9 and she comes in wearing a Rainbow Dash shirt. As we were doing introductions, I told her I liked her shirt, something innocent the same way people go \u2018those are some cool shoes\u2019 to a kid, nothing weird at all. After the day is done, my boss brings me into his office and confronts me about it, telling me again he thinks it\u2019s weird and to cut it out.\u201d\n\nEventually, FiredBrony was called in by his boss and told that he was making co-workers uncomfortable and was being let go. Bronies not being a protected class under civil rights laws, FiredBrony had no legal recourse.\n\nThe firing evoked this comment from Corey Robin, a blogger and political science professor:\n\n\u201cMost people seem to think that 1st Amendment-ish freedoms \u2014 the freedom of not merely speech but of expression, of personal style, etc. \u2014 apply in the workplace. They don\u2019t. And while there are a host of protections for protected categories of workers, those constitute a limited number of cases. The vast majority of cases of workplace coercion are simply not covered by federal or state law.... Unless you have a union, which ensures that you can only be fired for just cause, you\u2019re often screwed.\u201d\n\n(Actually, FiredBrony might have had a cause of action in California, but only if he had left his hobby at home. California\u2019s Supreme Court has held that the state Constitution\u2019s privacy protections bind private employers as well as the government, and an employment discrimination attorney told me that fired employees can sue for \u201cinterference with private affairs.\u201d)\n\nBut back to Robin\u2019s point: With some exceptions, private employers can fire people for irrelevant attributes such as appearance, personal style and preferences in entertainment.\n\nBut what\u2019s the remedy? A civil rights act that prohibited firings for any bad reason would exponentially increase the involvement of the government and the courts in the private workplace. That would dilute resources necessary to combat bias that is more entrenched and invidious than distaste for thirtysomething male Bronies.\n\nALSO:\n\nDon't wait on the debt limit\n\nThe haze around e-cigarettes\n\nThe real story behind all those Obamacare waivers", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "A civil rights act for 'My Little Pony' fans?", "date": "2013-10-05", "Description": "A \"Brony\" is sacked for his childish hobby", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "Several years ago I wrote a column about the paradox of laws against discrimination in hiring that are themselves discriminatory.
