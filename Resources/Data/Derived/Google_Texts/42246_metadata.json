But I know what I\u2019d say to outsiders who oppose Robert Griffin III\u2019s upcoming statue outside the school\u2019s new stadium:\n\nMind your business.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just college football we\u2019re talking about. It\u2019s college football in Texas, a state with 12 FBS schools spread across five conferences. If their babies can\u2019t grow up to be Cowboys, parents cross their fingers and hope for Longhorns, Red Raiders, Horned Frogs, or Aggies at the very least.\n\nOnly recently have Bears cracked the wish list and they\u2019re rising quickly. The $260 million, 45,000-seat McLane Stadium will help.\n\nSo will the 9.5-foot bronze sculpture of RG3, whose role in Baylor\u2019s resurgence is bigger than anyone not named Art Briles.\n\nRG3\u2019s immortalization doesn\u2019t have a thing to do with his nascent NFL career. He has played only 28 games for the Washington Redskins. His record as a starting quarterback is 12-16. He ended last season on the bench after his team lost five straight games.\n\nFolks in Waco reply: So what?\n\nGriffin\u2019s accomplishments at Baylor are substantial and permanent. There\u2019s nothing he can do to tarnish his legacy or diminish his role in reviving a moribund program. Even if he goes from NFL Rookie of the Year and NFC East division champ to injury-plagued bust and perennial loser, it won\u2019t change a thing on campus.\n\nBaylor is preparing to play its 109th season of intercollegiate football. It had won 10 games in a season only once before RG3 led the Bears to a 10-3 record in 2011, including an Alamo Bowl victory.\n\nHe lifted the program while improving his completion percentage each season and helped put butts in seats. Home attendance increased in each of his four seasons, rising from 34,124 per game to 41,368 in his final year.\n\nCritics say that\u2019s well and good, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily warrant a statue.\n\nThey\u2019re absolutely right.\n\nSo here\u2019s the trump card, the fact that should end any debate and shut-up every detractor:\n\nHE WON THE HEISMAN.\n\nThe Heisman Trophy has been awarded since 1935. Thanks to RG3, Baylor has produced the same number of winners as Alabama (Mark Ingram), Penn State (John Cappelletti) and Louisiana State (Billy Cannon). Griffin joined exclusive company as a player and brought his alma mater along for the ride.\n\nWinning that hunk of stiff-arming hardware pretty much seals the deal. The trophy virtually ensures a player\u2019s chance of being sculpted in the future.\n\nIn an area called Heisman Park, across the street from Owen Field, Oklahoma has statues of Sam Bradford, Jason White, Billy Sims, Steve Owens and Billy Vessels. The Florida trio of Tim Tebow, Danny Wuerffel and Steve Spurrier are cast in bronze outside The Swamp.\n\nErnie Davis stands erect between the Carrier Dome and Syracuse University\u2019s quad. Outside of Alumni Stadium, Boston College has a statute of Doug Flutie rearing back, with a plaque that reads \u201cThe \u2018Hail Mary\u2019 Pass.\u201d\n\nAbout 100 miles south of Waco, former Longhorns Ricky Williams and Earl Campbell are immortalized at Darrell K Royal\u2013Texas Memorial Stadium. In Dallas, Doak Walker has a statue between SMU\u2019s Gerald J. Ford Stadium and Dedman Center for Lifetime Sports.\n\nEven non-Heisman winners can get the bronze treatment. Notre Dame\u2019s \u201cFour Horsemen,\u201d Illinois\u2019 Harold \u201cRed\u201d Grange and Louisville\u2019s Johnny Unitas all have statues on campus.\n\nAnd don\u2019t get me started on the number of football coaches who have statues, at least a dozen. Notre Dame has four by itself.\n\nSometimes players are honored with a sculpture in their golden years. Other times the unveiling is done posthumously. I think all of us would prefer a chance to enjoy the artwork and the accolades.\n\nGive people flowers while they can still smell them.\n\nHe\u2019s only 23, but Griffin is and forever will be a legend at Baylor. Unveiling his statue when the stadium opens in the fall makes perfect sense. It\u2019s going to be one big party for fans and alumni, reveling in the state-of-the-art facility that features a humongous video screen that can be displayed on spectators\u2019 smart devices via special apps and a wireless network.\n\nFans of pro sports can snicker and sneer all they want. They can complain that RG3 doesn\u2019t deserve a statute, that he\u2019s still unproven and way too young. They can carp about modern society\u2019s instant gratification syndrome and perpetual lack of patience.\n\nTo which the Baylor faithful can respond:\n\nThis is between us and RG3; it\u2019s none of your concern.", "article_metadata": {"description": "I'm neither a Baylor University alum nor a fan of the Baylor Bears.
