Police said an officer and a “citizen” we injured in a shooting and hostage incident in a Wisconsin town on Saturday morning that prompted authorities to evacuate the area and call in a SWAT team.

One person was reportedly in custody after a standoff with police at a motorcycle shop in Neenah, Wisconsin.

The injuries were described as non-life threatening, a local ABC affiliate reported.

Authorities said the “scene has been made safe.” Everybody was accounted for, police said, and there was no longer a threat to the community, ABC reported.

Police on Saturday morning said they were investigating a shooting and an active hostage situation at Eagle Nation Cycles.

The ATF is sending agents from Milwaukee to help assist local police with their investigation of shooting Saturday morning, ABC reported.

“We are aware of the situation,” said Martin Siebenaler a Divisions Operations Officer and acting public information officer with the ATF in St. Paul, Minn.

Neenah Police said they evacuated homes and business within 1/4 mile of the shop Saturday morning. Neenah is about 40 miles south of Green Bay.

Around 10:30 a.m. local time, Neenah Police in a tweet said shots had been fired and urged anyone near Main St. to shelter in place away from windows, “in a basement if possible.”

Officials told a local ABC affiliate that hostages were involved in the incident earlier Saturday, after a man walked into the motorcycle repair shop and fired a weapon.

Officials at Theda Clark Medical Center in Neenah say one patient has been transported there, according to Megan Mulholland, a spokesperson with the hospital. The hospital, so far is expecting to receive two patients, according to ABC.

Multiple county police departments were responding to the scene and requested aid from a local SWAT team, ABC reported.
