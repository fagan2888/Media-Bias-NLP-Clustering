Republicans, who rode a red wave in 2014 to take control of the Nevada Senate and Assembly, are hoping to stay in command, though they face an uphill challenge. Democrats hold a 64,000 voter registration advantage statewide. In Clark County, home to 70 percent of Nevada\u2019s population, the gap tops 100,000.\n\nConservative Republicans, still fuming over the commerce tax approved by the 2015 Legislature and signed by Republican Gov. Brian Sandoval, took their more moderate colleagues to task, passing a resolution denouncing their support of the tax.\n\n\u201cHow can we hold our legislators\u2019 feet to the fire when they fail to represent us?\u201d said one delegate who supported a resolution amendment to insert language denouncing those who supported the tax.\n\nSandoval did not attend the convention.\n\nA proposed bylaw change to strip elected officials of their standing as automatic ex-officio members of the state party central committee failed. The measure, seen as another way to punish those who don\u2019t toe the party platform or fail to participate in grass-roots effort, was defeated when critics said it would boot other Republican legislators such as state Sen. Don Gustavson of Sparks who actively participates at the local level and frequently butts heads with his moderate colleagues.\n\nWhile the convention was tame, it was not without some heated discourse over the direction of the party as a whole.\n\nAn effort to shrink a seven-page party platform to a toned-down, one-page vision statement that eliminated stances on hot-button issues such as abortion failed after spirited discussion.\n\nThose who supported the simplified version said social issues should be left to individual candidates and removing them from the platform would make the party more inclusive.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t want to see our party die,\u201d said Robert Olaveson, a Clark County delegate who supported the abridged platform.\n\nBut others countered the party risked losing its identity if it remained silent.\n\nGustavson argued the one-page platform was OK for \u201canyone who doesn\u2019t stand for anything.\u201d\n\nDelegates approved the expanded platform with a single vote without discussion.\n\nThe platform calls for abolishing the IRS, repealing the Affordable Care Act, requiring voter ID, opposing same-day voter registration and eliminating minimum wage laws.\n\nIt opposes Question 1 on the Nevada ballot to require background checks for gun sales and transfers and recognizes the Second Amendment as a \u201cGod given right to keep and bear arms \u2026 under both the U.S. and Nevada constitutions.\u201d\n\nDelegates also declared support for transferring federally managed lands to Nevada and negotiating with the federal government over \u201chosting the nation\u2019s nuclear assets\u201d at Yucca Mountain.\n\nThe platform affirms the \u201csanctity of life\u201d from conception through natural death and opposes government funding of abortion.\n\nOn immigration, the platform opposes \u201camnesty, government benefits or other special treatment\u201d for those in the country illegally, as well as automatic citizenship for children born in the United States.\n\nThe convention did not finalize endorsements for state office candidates because of time constraints with printing and counting paper ballots. Results will be posted later on the state GOP website.\n\nContact Sandra Chereb at schereb@reviewjournal.com or 775-461-3821.
