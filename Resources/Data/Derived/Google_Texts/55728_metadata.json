Patty Murray (D-Wash.), reminding reporters in a Capitol Hill news conference of pledges that GOP leaders made in 2013 and have renewed this year to keep the government open.\n\n\"Well, we all remember what happened next. Republican leaders let the tea party take over, and they pushed us into a completely unnecessary shutdown in a bizarre and failed attempt to derail health care reform,\" Murray added. \"Unfortunately, Republican leaders don\u2019t seem to have learned any lessons from 2013, and once again we are just weeks away from an artificial crisis that could hurt our economy.\"\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) said before Congress went on its summer break that he would back a short-term continuing resolution to keep Uncle Sam in business if it were needed to buy some time. But when asked earlier Wednesday what his plans are to bring such a measure forward, he told reporters they are still to be determined, as are the elements that should go into such a stopgap bill.\n\nAsked if Republicans had brought any proposals to Democrats since work on Capitol Hill restarted this week, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) said they hadn't. \"We've heard nothing,\" he said.\n\nMurray noted that in 2013, when GOP leaders thought they had a way forward, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and like-minded House members balked and tried to use the moment to defund the Affordable Care Act. It failed but led to a shutdown.\n\nThis time, Cruz and others are threatening to link funding for Planned Parenthood to broader government spending.\n\nReid said Democrats would not accept any such measure laden with controversial riders, nor would they agree to a funding bill that reflects only a GOP desire to boost defense spending while cutting domestic programs.\n\n\"I cannot for the life of me understand what the Republicans expect,\" Reid said, adding that there must be a bona fide negotiation to get Democrats on board. \"They better consider how they\u2019re going to fund the government. They can\u2019t just jam us with something, 'cause it just won\u2019t work.\"\n\nDemocrats also insisted they would not cave.\n\n\"I think the resolve of the Senate Democrats is there,\" Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) told reporters. \"I think it has been throughout this process and I think that this resolve has strengthened by the position of the president. The president is not going to sign this bill. We know ultimately there has to be a better way.\"\n\nLaura Barron-Lopez contributed reporting.\n\nMichael McAuliff covers Congress and politics for The Huffington Post.
