Any material, for instance, relating to donations to the Clinton Foundation or speaking fees for Bill that might have been deleted by Hillary as \u201cpersonal\u201d would be covered, since both Abedin and Mills drew State Department paychecks. Correspondence between them and Hillary would be considered government records, even if yoga positions or Chelsea\u2019s wedding were the subject.\n\nThe perjury issue is serious. Judge Sullivan shows signs of increasing irritation, and the possibility that he will order the seizure of Hillary\u2019s server is growing. At that point, Huma and Cheryl have to wonder how good the FBI\u2019s data recovery team is. Should they be able to recover deleted emails (as many people believe possible) and the two assistants have not disclosed emails, they could face time in the federal pen.\n\nSo, assuming Hillary deleted those emails for a good reason, they now face the choice between ratting out the boss or facing orange is the new black for a period of time. Huma is the mother of a small child, and that prospect cannot be welcome.\n\nHere is the text of Judge Sullivan\u2019s order:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2015/08/huma_abedin_and_cheryl_mills_put_on_the_spot_by_blockbuster_court_order.html", "image": "http://www.americanthinker.com/assets/images/at-painter-og-image.png", "title": "Blog: Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills put on the spot by 'blockbuster' court order"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9ea1\"", "article_summary": "Judge Sullivan shows signs of increasing irritation, and the possibility that he will order the seizure of Hillary\u2019s server is growing.\nAt that point, Huma and Cheryl have to wonder how good the FBI\u2019s data recovery team is.\nHere is the text of Judge Sullivan\u2019s order:\nCorrespondence between them and Hillary would be considered government records, even if yoga positions or Chelsea\u2019s wedding were the subject.\nJudge Emmett Sullivan, who is hearing the FOIA lawsuit brought by Judicial Watch, has put Hillary Clinton\u2019s top aides Human Abedin and Cheryl Mills (and their boss Hillary) on the spot, in a ruling JW president Tom Fitton describes as a \u201cblockbuster.\u201d Judicial Watch summarizes (the text of the order appears below):This puts Hillary\u2019s two key factotums (factota?)"}
