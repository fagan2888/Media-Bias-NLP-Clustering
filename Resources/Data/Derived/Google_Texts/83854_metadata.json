If Republicans are to be believed, the glitches at www.healthcare.gov, which prevent people from enrolling in health plans that are worse than Hitler, are worse than Hitler. Or something.\n\nOne thing that has received little attention is that nearly 400,000 people have visited the federal exchange website and discovered they are eligible for Medicaid. In the first month, 7,535 Ohioans visited the exchange and discovered they were eligible for Medicaid.\n\nUnfortunately, if these folks were found to be eligible as part of the Medicaid expansion in Ohio, they would be stuck. That\u2019s because Kasich\u2019s Medicaid website makes it impossible to enroll in Medicaid at the moment.\n\nIt\u2019s true www.healthcare.gov may still be slow and have a few bugs, but it does properly calculate Medicaid eligibility. Kasich\u2019s www.benefits.ohio.gov, however, will quickly and reliably reject qualified applicants. Its computers don\u2019t reflect the Medicaid expansion, and they won\u2019t until December 9 (yeah, sure they will).\n\nUnlike the federal website (which lets you know that there\u2019s a problem) Kasich\u2019s website just tells people that they don\u2019t qualify for Medicaid and sends them away. It doesn\u2019t hold on to their application, and they won\u2019t be reprocessing their applications once the database is fixed. On top of that, the new website is 100% politically motivated.\n\nOf the six states using www.healthcare.gov for their exchange, only Ohio and Arizona have set up a separate Medicaid enrollment website. It\u2019s duplicative and serves only to have voters enroll in Medicaid beneath a banner with the governor\u2019s name (as if Medicaid expansion were purely his brainchild).\n\nSo surely, the media is giving Kasich\u2019s insultingly dysfunctional site the same treatment that they\u2019re giving the unreliable federal site?\n\nJudging by Ohio\u2019s newspaper coverage \u2013 e.g. Ohioans struggle with Obamacare mandate and State to open Medicaid enrollment early \u2013 mmm\u2026 not so much.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the New York Times, quoting only Republicans about how bad www.healthcare.gov is. For instance, Kasich\u2019s Medicaid Director (whose site doesn\u2019t work at all!) says that the federal site\u2019s glitchiness has \u201ccaused some measure of frustration.\u201d\n\nNote to media: these are concern trolls.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Plunderbund", "description": "Media coverage of Obamacare makes me think of the old song It\u2019s in his Kiss: If you wanna know (shoop shoop)If he\u2019s a concern trollIt comes down to this(The Medicaid website)\u00a0For all the complaints\u2026", "title": "Newly Eligible For Medicaid?
