He had looked into buying insurance on the open market, he added, but \u201cit\u2019s either prohibitively expensive \u2026 or it doesn\u2019t meet the qualifications\u201d of the healthcare law. Since the Badger State chose not create its own exchange, that meant navigating the treacherous waters of Healthcare.gov.\n\n\u201cMy first three forays into the system were small nightmares on their own,\u201d Scholl said. \u201cI was subjected to a very detailed and very intrusive set of requirements in terms of all the information that the system wanted about me and my kids and et cetera. It really wasn\u2019t telling me much. There were a few plans displayed on the exchange website, but they all had some sort of qualifiers or exceptions on them or were very vague about benefits and cost, bait-and-switch sorts of things: where you can get this plan, or that plan, but you have to qualify for it, or for a discount, and in order to find out, you have to enroll. It reminded me of a bear trap.\u201d\n\nAlready thoroughly confused, Scholl enlisted the help of a local insurance agent. After \u201cseveral hours\u201d of reviewing plans and discussing the \u201ccomplicated\u201d process by which an individual\u2019s tax subsidy for buying insurance is calculated, Scholl said they finally settled on a suitable plan. Scholl claims he tried \u201crepeatedly\u201d to sign up for the plan through Healthcare.gov, both on his own and with the agent\u2019s assistance, but found that no matter what he did, the system refused to include his 13- and 16-year-old daughters on the plan. (Another daughter, who is in college, was included.) After many hours of struggling with the website, the two men concluded that Healthcare.gov had determined that Scholl\u2019s minor children qualified for Medicaid and therefore would not permit them to be covered under his exchange plan \u2014 a common problem with ObamaCare, as The New American reported in January.\n\nAt the urging of the federal exchange, Scholl said, he decided to enroll his daughters directly in Medicaid, known in Wisconsin as BadgerCare. The BadgerCare website, he said, is \u201ceven more complicated and difficult\u201d than Healthcare.gov and is also \u201cextremely intrusive and extremely detailed on every member of the family and even members of the family that aren\u2019t there, marital relationships, and former marital relationships.\u201d It took him \u201cabout four hours just to fill in the blanks,\u201d he recalled, because the system repeatedly forced him to answer the same questions. Finally his application was accepted, and he said he got \u201ca sort of emailed acknowledgement that I had applied,\u201d but nothing telling him whether his daughters had been accepted into the program.\n\nStill not certain that he even had a plan or that all his children were on it, Scholl said he \u201cspent hours online and hours on the phone\u201d trying to get some definite answers. Eventually, he recalled, he did get through to someone at the local BadgerCare office who told him that it looked as if his daughters would qualify for the program and that he should receive an acknowledgement of their acceptance soon. According to Scholl, he got some acknowledgements via e-mail and snail mail, none of them stating that his daughters had been accepted and some of them requesting still more information, which he provided. He ended up calling BadgerCare again, where, he said, the bureaucrat on the other end of the line \u201cinformed me that my children did not qualify for BadgerCare.\u201d\n\nScholl said he called the exchange back and told them that his children didn\u2019t qualify for BadgerCare and that therefore he needed to add them to the plan he\u2019d selected \u2014 as, of course, he had desired from the outset. The exchange told him they couldn\u2019t allow that until they received word from BadgerCare \u2014 a task made considerably more difficult by the fact that the two entities \u201cwon\u2019t call each other,\u201d according to Scholl, forcing him to act as go-between.\n\nAfter more frustrating calls to BadgerCare, Scholl obtained a copy of the denial of his application and then had to fax and e-mail it \u201cseveral times to several layers of people\u201d at the exchange before the right person discovered it and told him that he could now add his daughters to his plan, he related. He was still unable to add them to the plan, he said, so he spent \u201can afternoon and an evening\u201d on the phone with the exchange, being bumped around from bureaucrat to bureaucrat, until eventually someone told him his kids had been added to his plan. \u201cIn fact,\u201d said Scholl, \u201cthey had started a whole new plan,\u201d which then invalidated both the old plan and the new plan.\n\nAfter \u201canother 10 days to two weeks of calls\u201d to BadgerCare, Scholl said he thought the problem had been straightened out: The old plan had been canceled, and the new one was in force. Then, he recounted, there was \u201canother round of 'well, your plan\u2019s not really active, and we have both these two plans out there, and we\u2019re not sure what\u2019s going on.'\u201d\n\nAt some point, Scholl was convinced that everything had been settled and was prepared to pay the next month\u2019s premium of $668 via automatic withdrawal from his bank account. \u201cSuddenly my wife calls me at work and \u2026 says, \u2018We have checks bouncing. We have payments that won\u2019t go through\u2026. And the reason is \u2026 the health insurance company through the exchange has used the automatic withdrawal to withdraw $1460.89 from our account,\u2019\u201d Scholl said. \u201cThat\u2019s two-and-a-half times [the expected withdrawal].\u201d\n\nThe next step was to call the insurance company, Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield. Scholl said he spent \u201can hour and a half to two hours \u2026 trying to get through their menu system to a human being.\u201d Adding insult to injury, he was repeatedly returned to the very first menu option, which asked, \u201cWould you like to pay your bill online?\u201d\n\nEventually, after pressing enough buttons and being sent through \u201cthree or four layers\u201d of people, Scholl found someone who could look into the issue. That individual told him that he was being billed for the full premium, not the premium minus the tax allowance (i.e., the price quoted by Healthcare.gov). The person told Scholl that the company would look into the matter and call him back by the end of the business day on June 3. Ten days later, Scholl said he had \u201cyet to get a call back from them\u201d despite making \u201cfour more calls\u201d to the company. He even had the insurance agent call Anthem and secure a promise to fax him details of how Scholl was being billed; that hasn\u2019t happened, either. With neither Scholl nor the agent confident that the issue has been resolved, the agent advised Scholl to stop the automatic payments so that he could at least see what he was being billed before paying it.\n\n\u201cSo here it is five, six months down the road, I\u2019m not even confident I have coverage,\u201d Scholl declared in exasperation. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I have my whole family on the plan. I don\u2019t have any confidence that they\u2019re not going to charge me some arbitrary amount\u2026. I have no idea how to contact anybody, and I know it\u2019s a nightmare to try to talk to anybody and get anybody to do anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cI expected a nightmare, and I got one,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe a bigger one than I expected.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Wisconsin, Alan Scholl, insurance, ObamaCare, exchamge, frustrating, frustration, socialized medicine, healthcare.gov, website", "og": {"url": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/health-care/item/18496-one-man-s-obamacare-nightmare", "image": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/media/k2/items/cache/157cfed6c5b2fb6aeb5fff6d48c3c34b_XL.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A Wisconsin man was frustrated and tied up in red tape when he tried to buy insurance on an ObamaCare exchange, and he's still not sure his family is covered. by Michael Tennant", "title": "One Man\u2019s ObamaCare \u201cNightmare\u201d"}, "image": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/media/k2/items/cache/157cfed6c5b2fb6aeb5fff6d48c3c34b_XL.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0254\"", "article_summary": "The person told Scholl that the company would look into the matter and call him back by the end of the business day on June 3.\nAt the urging of the federal exchange, Scholl said, he decided to enroll his daughters directly in Medicaid, known in Wisconsin as BadgerCare.\nI have no idea how to contact anybody, and I know it\u2019s a nightmare to try to talk to anybody and get anybody to do anything.\u201d\u201cI expected a nightmare, and I got one,\u201d he said.\nScholl\u2019s odyssey through the ObamaCare labyrinth began more than five months and, by his estimate, \u201cwell over 100 hours\u201d of effort ago \u2014 and it is still unresolved.\n\u201cIn fact,\u201d said Scholl, \u201cthey had started a whole new plan,\u201d which then invalidated both the old plan and the new plan."}
