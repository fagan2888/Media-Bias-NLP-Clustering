Researchers further found that the $244 million in bonuses paid out to the first two groups essentially wiped out any Medicare savings generated by the first group's lower spending.\n\n\"These results suggest that ACOs with no downside risk can achieve savings, but that savings to Medicare and society may be slow to develop,\" lead author J. Michael McWilliams, M.D., Ph.D., associate professor of healthcare policy at Harvard Medical School said in a statement. \"But the incentives for ACOs to lower spending are currently very weak, so savings may accelerate if the incentives are strengthened.\"\n\nA closer look by the researchers found that independent primary care groups had higher savings within the ACO cohorts than hospital-integrated groups, which they speculated may be due to stronger incentives for the independent primary care docs to reduced inpatient and outpatient spending. They further determined savings were higher for MSSP ACOs with relatively high spending for their geographical region, indicating that it was easier to cut spending for providers with more opportunities to do so.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the study abstract\n\n- check out the statement\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nMedicare ACOs saved $411M in 2014, but few earned bonuses\n\nCritic blames CMS for lack of understanding of shared savings accountable care model\n\nCMS proposes changes to ACO structure under Medicare Shared Savings Program\n\nNext Generation ACOs: Most participants were previously in Pioneer and MSSP models\n\nCMS unveils first group of Next Generation ACOs\n\nAmid mixed news for Medicare ACOs, experts fear model is 'unsustainable'", "article_metadata": {"description": "It's been a bumpy road for Medicare Accountable Care Organizations, with only 97 of 353 Pioneer and Medicare Shared Savings Program ACOs earning performance bonuses in 2014, and new data show the MSSP achieved mixed results its first year, according to research published in the New England Journal of Medicine.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "It's been a bumpy road for Medicare Accountable Care Organizations, with only 97 of 353 Pioneer and Medicare Shared Savings Program ACOs earning performance bonuses in 2014, and new data show the MSSP achieved mixed results its first year, according to research published in the New England Journal of Medicine.", "title": "Mixed news for first year of Medicare Shared Savings Program", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/mixed-news-first-year-medicare-shared-savings-program/2016-04-15", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs),independent primary care groups,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,Medicare ACOs,Medicare Shared Savings Program,Operations & Business Management,shared savings", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,Operations & Business Management"}, "article_summary": "It's been a bumpy road for Medicare Accountable Care Organizations, with only 97 of 353 Pioneer and Medicare Shared Savings Program ACOs earning performance bonuses in 2014, and new data show the MSSP achieved mixed results its first year, according to research published in the New England Journal of Medicine.\nResearchers further found that the $244 million in bonuses paid out to the first two groups essentially wiped out any Medicare savings generated by the first group's lower spending.\n\"But the incentives for ACOs to lower spending are currently very weak, so savings may accelerate if the incentives are strengthened.\"\nTo learn more:- read the study abstract- check out the statementRelated Articles:Medicare ACOs saved $411M in 2014, but few earned bonusesCritic blames CMS for lack of understanding of shared savings accountable care modelCMS proposes changes to ACO structure under Medicare Shared Savings ProgramNext Generation ACOs: Most participants were previously in Pioneer and MSSP modelsCMS unveils first group of Next Generation ACOsAmid mixed news for Medicare ACOs, experts fear model is 'unsustainable'\nThey further determined savings were higher for MSSP ACOs with relatively high spending for their geographical region, indicating that it was easier to cut spending for providers with more opportunities to do so."}
