He was cleared to skate in early September and has been wearing a light blue non-contact jersey during Capitals practice in recent weeks.\n\n\u201cI can do whatever,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cI\u2019ve been cleared to practice full-out and battling and I\u2019m not staying out of any drills anymore. It\u2019s definitely coming around, and the next step\u2019s game play, for sure.\u201d\n\nA first-round draft pick by the Capitals in 2012, Wilson played in all 82 games last season, when he had three goals and seven assists and recorded 151 penalty minutes while playing almost exclusively on the fourth line.\n\nHe last played in Hershey in 2013, when he joined the Bears for three playoff games during their eventual loss in the Eastern Conference quarterfinals.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Wilson, who was initially scheduled to make his return during the Capitals' three-game Western Canada road trip this week, was instead re-assigned to the team's AHL affiliate on Monday afternoon.", "Author": "Zac Boyer", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Wilson, who was initially scheduled to make his return during the Capitals\u2019 three-game Western Canada road trip this week, was instead re-assigned to the team\u2019s AHL affiliate on Monday afternoon.", "title": "Capitals assign Tom Wilson to Hershey to continue recovery from broken left leg", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/oct/20/capitals-assign-tom-wilson-hershey-continue-recove/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/12/19/capitals-flyers-hocke_lanc14.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/12/19/capitals-flyers-hocke_lanc14.jpg", "title": "Capitals assign Tom Wilson to Hershey to continue recovery from broken", "description": "Wilson, who was initially scheduled to make his return during the Capitals' three-game Western Canada road trip this week, was instead re-assigned to the team's AHL affiliate on Monday afternoon.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Sports, Tom Wilson, Washington Capitals, Hershey"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0686\"", "article_summary": "The next stage in Washington Capitals winger Tom Wilson\u2019s recovery from a broken left fibula will occur in Hershey.\nHe was cleared to skate in early September and has been wearing a light blue non-contact jersey during Capitals practice in recent weeks.\nWilson, who was initially scheduled to make his return during the Capitals\u2018 three-game Western Canada road trip this week, was instead re-assigned to the team\u2019s AHL affiliate on Monday afternoon.\nWilson broke the bone in July, and has only described the injury as the result of an accident at a friend\u2019s house.\nHe last played in Hershey in 2013, when he joined the Bears for three playoff games during their eventual loss in the Eastern Conference quarterfinals."}
