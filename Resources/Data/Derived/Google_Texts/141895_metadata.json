They don't know what to expect. They're all individuals. They're bringing in all sorts of different backgrounds. We try to get them to be disciplined right off the bat to make sure they bond and quickly gel together and learn as a group\u2026 They learn to be a team, work as a team, fail as a team and all progress through the team.\"\n\nOfficials said the Academy will run through December 4, and recruits will receive over 1,000 hours of intensive training including physical fitness, traffic accident investigation, patrol techniques, legal issues, firearms, law enforcement driver training, community relations and criminal investigations, as well as 70 hours of Spanish language instruction.\n\nAccording to officials, Recruit Class #132 consists of 37 males and seven females.
