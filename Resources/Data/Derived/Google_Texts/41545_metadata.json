The study looked at cesarean sections, breast-feeding, episiotomy and vaginal birth after cesarean section.\n\nBut why there is correlation between outcomes and the wealth of the surrounding neighborhood is an open question. Experts say looking at just the cost of living in an area doesn\u2019t provide a complete explanation for varying outcomes. There are many disparate factors within childbirth metrics, including the demographics of the patient population, as well as the values of the hospital\u2019s physicians and staff.\n\nCalifornia Pacific Medical Center, which handles nearly 44 percent of the city\u2019s births, was ranked third out of the four major hospitals in the city. Notably, one out of four new mothers there received a cesarean section, according to the San Francisco Department of Public Health. California Pacific Medical Center\u2019s California campus is located in Pacific Heights, one of San Francisco\u2019s most expensive neighborhoods, where the median home price is about $1.4 million. California Pacific Medical Center also offers a smaller volume labor and delivery center at its St. Luke\u2019s Campus, located in San Francisco\u2019s \u201cMission\u201d neighborhood where the median home price is over $1.1 million.\n\nAnother factor in outcome measures may have to do with varying hospital policies with regard to patient care. Both San Francisco General and UCSF offer extensive midwifery services in addition to traditional delivery doctors. California Pacific Medical Center does offer midwifery services but to a lesser extent.\n\nCalifornia Pacific Medical Center also offers a smaller volume labor and delivery center at its St. Luke\u2019s Campus, located in San Francisco\u2019s \u201cMission\u201d neighborhood. Additionally, this updated story also clarifies that\n\nCalifornia Pacific Medical Center does offer midwifery services but to a lesser extent.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s local culture by and large,\u201d said Dr. Elliott Main, medical director of the California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative, and chairman of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of California Pacific Medical Center. \u201cLabor and delivery is driven by physicians, nurses and patients. Everyone contributes to that. It\u2019s [about] how people value normal birth \u2026 And that varies.\u201dIn San Francisco, the study by the California HealthCare Foundation gave the highest score for labor and delivery outcomes measured to San Francisco General, which had a cesarean section rate of 16 percent. San Francisco General is located on the east side of the city\u2019s Mission neighborhood, where the median home price around the hospital is about $675,000, according to Trulia\u2019s home pricing index.According to the most recent regulations from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, cesarean sections are thought to be associated with less favorable outcomes, especially for future pregnancies.Despite that, many patients and doctors still prefer to plan a caesarean section over having natural childbirth. Some women opt for cesarean section procedures to natural birth, avoiding pain and tearing, said Dr. Angie Jelin, a former maternal fetal medicine specialist at UCSF (University of California, San Francisco) Hospital. Scheduled cesarean sections also allow women to plan exact arrival dates for their babies, she added.The ability to schedule births can also be attractive to hospitals and their physicians from an economic perspective, said Rachael Kagan, chief communications officer at San Francisco General.\u201cThere is a notion of scheduling births, of scheduling cesarean sections \u2026 Sometimes you\u2019ll see the [cesarean section] rate reflect scheduling priorities for physicians and the convenience for the provider team,\u201d Kagan said.San Francisco General is a public hospital, unlike the majority of California hospitals, including California Pacific Medical Center, which are private. Being a public hospital means physicians are salaried, \u201cso there is no incentive for physicians to bill differently,\u201d Kagan said.Yet some hospitals also stand to make higher profits from cesarean section procedures versus natural births. The average total cost for a cesarean procedure is 67 percent higher than the cost of a traditional vaginal birth, according to a 2013 study by Truven Health Analytics. In the study, cost was defined as the amount that employers, Medicaid managed care plans, Medicaid programs and others pay hospitals, clinicians and other service providers.In general, midwives are trained to promote natural birth over surgical procedures. They are also heavy supporters of breast-feeding. Jelin says during the daytime hours at UCSF, almost all patients see a midwife during their care, unless they are classified as high-risk. Because midwives cannot perform cesarean sections themselves, she says, it stands to reason that procedures might be lower at hospitals that rely heavily on their services.San Francisco General has midwives available to every patient 24 hours a day, as well as a volunteer doula program, Kagan said. \u201cWe have a commitment to providing many forms of complementary care, which [can] reduce extreme interventions.\u201dMain of California Pacific Medical Center cautions against evaluating hospitals based solely upon select metrics, such as cesarean section and vaginal birth after cesarean section. When evaluating hospital outcomes, consideration should be given to patient demographics, such as age, insurance type and race, he said.\u201cOur patients are much older than those at San Francisco General,\u201d Main said in addressing the differences in cesarean section procedures between the two hospitals. \u201cWe have the oldest [patient] population in the state of California. Almost half our mothers are over 35.\u201dAt San Francisco General, 54 percent of labor and delivery patients are between 20 and 29 years old, according to the San Francisco Department of Health. At California Pacific Medical Center, nearly 75 percent of patients are between 30 and 39 years old.Main also noted higher rates of cesarean procedures in privately insured patients and differences in insurance policies between patients at respective hospitals. Nearly 85 percent of patients at California Pacific Medical Center have private insurance, while nearly 95 percent of patients at San Francisco General Hospital have insurance through government-funded Medi-Cal.Ultimately, Jelin attributes trends in hospital performance metrics to patient preferences.\u201cAt UCSF, we wouldn\u2019t give elective C-sections, but other hospitals will. So if you\u2019re a patient who wants that, you\u2019ll go [elsewhere]. The same is true for midwives. The patients who came to UCSF tended to want that service,\u201d Jelin said. \u201cPatient choices do dictate outcomes to some extent.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Peninsula Press", "description": "This statewide trend is illustrated locally across the Bay Area and in San Francisco, where the best hospital labor and delivery metrics are often in areas where median housing prices are some of the lowest.", "title": "Good birth outcomes more prevalent in some of California\u2019s less expensive neighborhoods - Peninsula Press", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://peninsulapress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/BirthOutcomesMap_Cropped.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-04-16T08:27:32+00:00", "url": "http://peninsulapress.com/2015/04/13/good-birth-outcomes-california/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PeninsuPress", "section": "Data Hub", "tag": "San Francisco", "published_time": "2015-04-13T07:30:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-16T08:27:32+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "This statewide trend is illustrated locally across the Bay Area and in San Francisco, where the best hospital labor and delivery metrics are often in areas where median housing prices are some of the lowest.", "creator": "@PeninsuPress", "image": "http://peninsulapress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/BirthOutcomesMap_Cropped.jpg", "title": "Good birth outcomes more prevalent in some of California\u2019s less expensive neighborhoods - Peninsula Press", "site": "@PeninsuPress", "card": "summary"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.2.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc8d4\"", "article_summary": "California Pacific Medical Center\u2019s California campus is located in Pacific Heights, one of San Francisco\u2019s most expensive neighborhoods, where the median home price is about $1.4 million.\nAdditionally, this updated story also clarifies thatCalifornia Pacific Medical Center does offer midwifery services but to a lesser extent.\nCalifornia Pacific Medical Center does offer midwifery services but to a lesser extent.\nCalifornia Pacific Medical Center, which handles nearly 44 percent of the city\u2019s births, was ranked third out of the four major hospitals in the city.\nCalifornia Pacific Medical Center also offers a smaller volume labor and delivery center at its St. Luke\u2019s Campus, located in San Francisco\u2019s \u201cMission\u201d neighborhood."}
