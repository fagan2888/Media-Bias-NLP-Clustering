Here’s a fun factoid: before she joined MSNBC as the co-host of “The Cycle,” Krystal Ball worked at CGI Federal, the company that notoriously botched the Healthcare.gov rollout in 2013. (BOMBSHELL: IRS Has Active Contract For MILLIONS With Company HHS Fired Over Botched Healthcare.gov)

Ball revealed the tidbit in an interview with Cosmopolitan. “I thought about getting a Ph.D. in economics, but after I graduated, I got a job at the company that is now famous for screwing up Healthcare.gov. I helped them design accounting systems for the federal courts. I also started working on getting a CPA. I did that for a few years and got a bit bored of it.”

To be clear, Ball worked for CGI before they began work on the Healthcare.gov. She quit after a chance encounter with a man she met on a plane who offered her a job in education software. “We ended up having a six-hour conversation… About a month later I ended up quitting my job and moving in with him, and he’s now my husband.” (VIDEO: MSNBC Host Blames Ebola Crisis On The NRA)

The rest is history. Ball ran for the House of Representatives in Virginia, losing horribly once photos emerged of her sucking off a dildo while dressed as a sexy Santa. After claiming the widespread mockery over the images was sexist, she managed to get several guest appearances on MSNBC — which turned into a permanent hosting gig.

Hey look! Here are the pictures now!

Ironically, Ball was quite critical of the Obamacare rollout back in 2013. “I was prepared for some glitches,” she said at the time. “But this is a catastrophe.”
