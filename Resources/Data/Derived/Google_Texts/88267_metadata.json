But the analysis also noted that because \"the Trump campaign has not provided any information on the size of their proposed block grants,\" it is \"impossible to score any savings\" for his plan.\n\nHowever, the group did make several estimates for savings based on different scenarios for a Medicaid block-grant system, including indexing the grants to growing more slowly than the current law, indexing the grants to per-person gross domestic product and freezing the grants in nominal dollars.\n\n\"The amount of money this proposal would save (or cost) depends entirely on the size of that allotment, and how much it grows each year,\" the analysis said.\n\n\n\nUnder the most conservative scenario, the group said, moving to block grants could save the federal government no money at all. But under a more aggressive scenario, about $915 billion in Medicaid savings could be realized.\n\n\"If Mr. Trump intends to generate aggressive savings from block granting Medicaid, it could more than pay for the cost of repealing and replacing Obamacare \u2014 though perhaps at the cost of a further reduction in coverage,\" the analysis said.", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "A proposal to repeal Obamacare and make other changes would cost nearly $500 billion and lead to almost 21 million more uninsured people.", "author": "Dan Mangan", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "Estimates say Trump's proposal to repeal Obamacare and make other changes could cost nearly $500 billion and lead to 21 million more uninsured people.", "title": "Higher cost, fewer insured: Trump's health plan", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2016/03/14/more-more-uninsured-donald-trumps-health-care-plan.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2016/03/15/103471670-GettyImages-485981791.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Estimates say Trump's proposal to repeal Obamacare and make other changes could cost nearly $500 billion and lead to 21 million more uninsured people.", "title": "More $$$, more uninsured: Donald Trump's health-care plan", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2016/03/14/more-more-uninsured-donald-trumps-health-care-plan.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2016/03/15/103471670-GettyImages-485981791.1910x1000.jpg"}, "creator": "@_DanMangan", "site": "@CNBC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "CNBC Business News and Finance", "app_store_id": 398018310}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398018310", "GOOGLEBOT": "unavailable_after: 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT", "keywords": "Politics, Politics, Obamacare, Donald Trump, Health Care, Health Insurance, US: News, business news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnbc", "published_time": "2016-03-14T16:43:04-0400", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/dan.mangan.54", "section": "Politics", "modified_time": "2016-03-15T14:27:23-0400", "tag": "US: News"}, "pageNodeId": 103467845, "news_keywords": "Trump, Obamacare, presidential campaign, Affordable Care, health plan. repeal obamacare, uninsured"}, "article_summary": "But under a more aggressive scenario, about $915 billion in Medicaid savings could be realized.\nUnder the most conservative scenario, the group said, moving to block grants could save the federal government no money at all.\nThe group did say that Trump's proposal to award Medicaid funds to state governments via block grants \"could generate a wide range of savings\" to the federal budget.\n\"Mr. Trump's plan to repeal and replace Obamacare \u2014 based on the details available \u2014 would both add to the deficit and significantly reduce coverage,\" the group said.\nEven if purported benefits from faster economic growth were factored in, the Trump health plan would still add about $270 billion in costs to the federal budget, the nonpartisan budget advocacy group said in an analysis."}
