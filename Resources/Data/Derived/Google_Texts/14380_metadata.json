The new survey suggests that the Pope is arguably the most well-regarded religious figure among the American public today, said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland.\n\nNine months into his papacy, the Argentine-born Francis has captured attention with crowd-pleasing acts of compassion, from embracing a severely disfigured man, to washing the feet of juvenile delinquents, to hosting homeless men at his birthday Mass this month.\n\nThe Pope has also shown a common touch rare for such a lofty religious leader. He has eschewed the trappings of the papacy in favor of humbler digs, simpler vestments and a cheaper car. He worked as a bar bouncer and a janitor before he was a priest, and is not shy about telling people.\n\nPope: I was once a bar bouncer\n\nAccording to one study, Pope Francis was the most talked about person on the Internet this year, and even atheists have professed appreciation for the 77-year-old pontiff.\n\nThe breadth of Francis' popularity was on display at American newsstands this month: he was named person of the year by both Time magazine and The Advocate, a gay and lesbian publication.\n\n\"While 2013 will be remembered for the work of hundreds in advancing marriage equality, it will also be remembered for the example of one man,\" The Advocate said. In remarks that rippled across the globe, Pope Francis said in July, \"If someone is gay and he searches for the Lord and has good will, who am I to judge?\u201d\n\nPope Francis on gays: 'Who am I to judge?'\n\nWhile the Pope has not changed church doctrine, he has urged Catholics to shift their focus from culture war issues to caring for people on society's margins, especially the poor.\n\n\"I see the church as a field hospital after battle,\" Francis said in September.\n\nAmerican Catholics appear to like the new course the Pope has set for their church. Nearly two-thirds agree with him about the amount of attention that should be paid to issues such as abortion and homosexuality, according to the CNN/ORC poll.\n\nMore than 85% of American Catholics say Francis is neither too liberal nor too conservative, and 86% say he's in touch with the modern world. By comparison, more than half of American Catholics said Pope John Paul II was out of step with the times in 2003, near the end of his 26-year-long papacy.\n\nBut Francis has been a fierce critic of the status quo, especially what calls the \"idolatry of money\" present in modern-day capitalism. In a papal statement last month, for example, the Pope blasted the theory of trickle-down economics, calling it \"crude and na\u00efve.\"\n\nConservative critics such as Rush Limbaugh pounced on the Pope's remarks, calling him a closet Marxist. But nearly two in three American Catholics agree with the Pope about capitalism and the free market's effects on the poor, according to the CNN/ORC poll.\n\nPope: Marxist ideology is 'wrong'\n\nOn other key issues for Catholics - the role of women in the church and the sexual abuse crises - Francis gets similarly high ratings from his American flock.\n\nMore than six in 10 American Catholics agree with Francis' comments about women in the church, according to the CNN/ORC poll. The Pope has said that women should have a larger role in church governance but cannot be ordained as priests.\n\nSimilarly, more than six in 10 American Catholics say Francis is doing a good job handling fallout from the church's sexual abuse scandal, even as most (64%) also say the church overall has done a poor job on the issue.\n\nThis month, the Vatican announced the creation of a new commission to care for victims of clergy sexual abuse and to prevent future crimes.\n\nAmerican Catholics had given especially low marks on the sexual abuse scandal to Francis' predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, with just 36% saying in 2010 that he had handled the issue well.\n\nCNN's Holland said it's difficult to ascertain exactly how Francis' popularity stacks up against his predecessors, however. \"It's a tough question since polling on Popes is pretty sparse,\" he said.\n\nWhat's more, like political polling, approval ratings shift depending on the public mood and perception of a Pope's performance.\n\nFor example, three-quarters of American Catholics approved of how John Paul was leading the church in 1994; that number rose to 84% in 1999 and dipped to 64% in 2003, at the height of the church's sexual abuse crisis.\n\nIt remains to be seen how long the honeymoon will last for Francis, and how long he can continue to build goodwill among American Catholics.\n\nThe poll was conducted for CNN by ORC International on December 16 through Thursday, with 1,035 adults nationwide, including 191 Catholics, questioned by telephone. The survey's overall sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points.\n\nPope Francis' greatest hits of 2013", "article_metadata": {"description": "By\u00a0Daniel Burke, CNN Belief Blog Co-Editor (CNN) -- As Pope Francis prepares to celebrate his first Christmas at the Vatican, Americans' opinions of the pontiff appear to be as high as the dome on St. Peter's Basilica, according to a new survey.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "title": "CNN Poll: Pope's approval rating sky-high", "og": {"url": "http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2013/12/24/cnn-poll-popes-approval-rating-sky-high/", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/131221070721-pop-francis-1214-horizontal-gallery.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "By\u00a0Daniel Burke, CNN Belief Blog Co-Editor\r\n\r\n\r\n(CNN) -- As Pope Francis prepares to celebrate his first Christmas at the Vatican, Americans' opinions of the pontiff appear to be as high as the dome on St. Peter's Basilica, according to a new survey.", "title": "CNN Poll: Pope's approval rating sky-high"}, "msvalidate.01": "DE341CAC7D45B696ED1776216C18054C", "fb": {"admins": 690014395, "app_id": 80401312489}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CNN Belief Blog", "keywords": "catholic church, christianity, culture wars, leaders, pope benedict xvi, pope francis, pope john paul ii, sex abuse, vatican, catholic, catholic church, pope, pope benedict xvi, pope francis, pope john paul ii, vatican", "google-site-verification": "mFBa4OnyEDU23vgVJ6rtX_4izud7FIi9JiscfVsWaKk", "original-source": "http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2013/12/24/cnn-poll-popes-approval-rating-sky-high/", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca075\"", "article_summary": "More than 85% of American Catholics say Francis is neither too liberal nor too conservative, and 86% say he's in touch with the modern world.\nMore than six in 10 American Catholics agree with Francis' comments about women in the church, according to the CNN/ORC poll.\nThis month, the Vatican announced the creation of a new commission to care for victims of clergy sexual abuse and to prevent future crimes.\nPope Francis' greatest hits of 2013\nIt remains to be seen how long the honeymoon will last for Francis, and how long he can continue to build goodwill among American Catholics."}
