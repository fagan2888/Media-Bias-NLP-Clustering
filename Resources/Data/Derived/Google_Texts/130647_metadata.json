Elsewhere, designers including Vivienne Westwood, Pringle of Scotland and Jonathan Saunders showcased their latest designs.\n\nSome highlights from Day 3:\n\n___\n\nPUNK AND POLITICS AT VIVIENNE WESTWOOD\n\nVivienne Westwood displayed mannish tweed coats, beautifully tailored jackets and draped dresses, her signature tartan and lots of animal prints. But that\u2019s not what she wanted to talk about.\n\nThe grand dame of British fashion has one message for her guests, and it\u2019s written loud and clear on her show invitation: Vote Green.\n\nThe flame-haired designer, 73, has a reputation for using her fashion shows to promote causes dear to her heart, from campaigning for Wikileaks\u2019 Julian Assange to protesting against fracking (a controversial method of extracting natural gas.)\n\nMoments before her show opened Sunday, Westwood railed backstage about capitalism and inequality. She told The Associated Press that mainstream British politics was a shambles, and the only party worth voting for, come election day in May, was the small, left-wing Green Party.\n\nOn the runway, the attitude was just as feisty: Westwood had her models don spiky hairdos, and some wore huge chokers with silver chains and harnesses.\n\nFront row guests included actresses Noomi Rapace and Gwendoline Christie, of \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d fame.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Kendall Jenner steals spotlight at London shows", "title": "Kendall Jenner steals spotlight at London shows", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Kendall Jenner steals spotlight at London shows", "title": "Kendall Jenner steals spotlight at London shows", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/02/22/kendall_jenner_steals_spotlight_at_london_shows/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/02/aptopix-britain-london-fashion-week-saunders.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Kendall Jenner steals spotlight at London shows", "title": "Kendall Jenner steals spotlight at London shows", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/02/aptopix-britain-london-fashion-week-saunders.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sylvia Hui", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Elsewhere, designers including Vivienne Westwood, Pringle of Scotland and Jonathan Saunders showcased their latest designs.\nThe grand dame of British fashion has one message for her guests, and it\u2019s written loud and clear on her show invitation: Vote Green.\nReality TV star and model Kendall Jenner whipped up a mini storm as she arrived for Topshop Unique\u2019s show, trailing dozens of paparazzi and fans desperate for a glimpse of her.\nShe told The Associated Press that mainstream British politics was a shambles, and the only party worth voting for, come election day in May, was the small, left-wing Green Party.\nSome highlights from Day 3:___PUNK AND POLITICS AT VIVIENNE WESTWOODVivienne Westwood displayed mannish tweed coats, beautifully tailored jackets and draped dresses, her signature tartan and lots of animal prints."}
