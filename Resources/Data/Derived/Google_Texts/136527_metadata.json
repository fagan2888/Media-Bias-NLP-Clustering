Part of his proposal is to pour $6.5 million into career and technical education in the form of grants and scholarships.\n\n\u201cThese programs give students experiences so they understand these aren\u2019t \u2018dirty jobs\u2019 but opportunities to work with the latest technology,\u201d Daugaard said.\n\nDemocrats agree work force development is the biggest issue facing the state but they also say schools haven\u2019t had enough money to fund these programs recently because of the cuts made in 2011. House Minority Leader Representative Bernie Hunhoff is supporting a 3.8 percent increase in state funding for school districts this year to get schools back to those funding levels.\n\n\u201cWe need to restore that funding because K-12 schools are clearly our best economic development tool. We need to get them funded properly so they can provide those type of programs,\u201d Hunhoff said.\n\nHunhoff says expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act is also a work force development tool. It's something Daugaard has decided not to pursue because of the shaky roll out of the health care law.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a critical component of work force development. We\u2019re going to have folks who can\u2019t afford insurance here in South Dakota but are in the workforce who will probably leave the state to a state that they can get health care insurance; that\u2019s a critical part,\" Hunhoff said.\n\nAnd over the next 37 days, Democrats and Republicans will work on this issue and several others as South Dakota\u2019s 2014 legislative session begins.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the state of our state today?\u201d Daugaard asked. \u201cThe state of South Dakota is strong and I know the best is yet to come. Let\u2019s all work hard this year.\u201d\n\nEconomic Development Office Investigation\n\nDaugaard also talked about the audits he ordered after it was revealed this fall that there was financial misconduct in the state economic development office prior to his administration. He says those audits will likely be done by the end of the month and the information will be shared with lawmakers and the public.\n\n\u201cThis is a serious matter and it deserves serious attention from state officials,\u201d Daugaard said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "KELOLAND News", "description": "South Dakota has one of the lowest unemployment rates in the country, which is a blessing and a curse, and the reason Governor Dennis Daugaard spent", "title": "Daugaard: 'State Of South Dakota Is Strong'", "url": "http://www.keloland.com/news/article/politics/daugaard-state-of-south-dakota-is-strong", "image": "http://kelolandassets.blob.core.windows.net/kelolandassets/images/default-source/agriculture/crops/barley/54994.jpg?sfvrsn=0", "type": "website"}, "fb": {"app_id": 521498541203189}, "Generator": "Sitefinity 7.3.5630.0 PE", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "South Dakota has one of the lowest unemployment rates in the country, which is a blessing and a curse, and the reason Governor Dennis Daugaard spent"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8148\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe state of South Dakota is strong and I know the best is yet to come.\n\u201cSouth Dakota works because South Dakota\u2019s people know how to work,\u201d Daugaard said.\nDaugaard provided updates on several South Dakota programs during his speech but he talked the most about training skilled workers.\nWe\u2019re going to have folks who can\u2019t afford insurance here in South Dakota but are in the workforce who will probably leave the state to a state that they can get health care insurance; that\u2019s a critical part,\" Hunhoff said.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the state of our state today?\u201d Daugaard asked."}
