The library received about $1.9 million from the county in the current fiscal year.\n\nIf approved, that money would go to end furlough days, and also help bolster a dwindling reserve fund, now down to about $117,000, which has been used to cover shortfalls in recent years.\n\nThe library system will benefit from the recent passage of a new five-year round of special purpose local option sales tax, or SPLOST VII, with $2.5 million in revenues earmarked for renovations to the main library branch in Gainesville, as well as the purchase of new materials.\n\nBut SPLOST money cannot be used for operational expenses, and library representatives and supporters said they hope Hall County will step up to meet their needs.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at the bottom of the barrel,\u201d said library system Director Adrian Mixson. \u201cWe\u2019re struggling to operate.\u201d\n\nThe library Board of Trustees is also pushing for Gainesville and Oakwood to begin collecting impact fees from new development and construction to support local libraries.\n\nHall County and Flowery Branch are the only local governments to collect these impact fees for the library.\n\nWhile Hall spends significantly less on library funding per capita than Forsyth and Gwinnett counties, a point library officials made on Monday, commissioners said this isn\u2019t a fair comparison.\n\nHigher home prices in those counties mean more property tax revenues, they said, and Forsyth only doles out money to support one municipality, for example.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not Forsyth,\u201d Commissioner Scott Gibbs said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to figure out somewhere to cut costs.\u201d\n\nWithout additional funding, Pettitt said tough funding choices are coming, and it\u2019s hard for board members to know where to even begin.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to have a very candid conversation about where to cut,\u201d he added.\n\nThe appeals for more funding for the library system during Monday\u2019s budget presentation were highlighted by young Josh Lander.\n\nHis mother, Ashley, explained that Josh, who is 5 years old, has a prolonged illness for which he receives treatment at Emory University.\n\nSo Josh is taught at home, using the library as a major resource for his learning.\n\n\u201cI cannot reiterate the importance of the library and the resources that are provided there for us and for him,\u201d Ashley said. \u201cWe\u2019re library rats. Some people hang out at the gym ... we hang out at the library. And because of that we have been able to keep up with his education ...\u201d\n\nJosh, delivering his own appeal, made it known just how much he values libraries.\n\n\u201cI love the library because I love to read,\u201d Josh said. \u201cSometimes when I wake up and I want to go to the library ... it\u2019s closed. And it makes me sad.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.gainesvilletimes.com/archives/109807/", "image": "http://media.morristechnology.com/webmedia/upload/gainesville/article/2015/05/18/0519BUDGET5.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "In some ways, the Hall County Library System is a microcosm of how budget cuts impacted public services during the economic recession.", "title": "Library system seeks additional $200K from county as state continues to slash budget"}, "twitter": {"site": "@gtimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "title": "Library system seeks additional $200K from county as state continues to slash budget"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc704\"", "article_summary": "In some ways, the Hall County Library System is a microcosm of how budget cuts impacted public services during the economic recession.\n\u201cWe\u2019re at the bottom of the barrel,\u201d said library system Director Adrian Mixson.\nTwo branches were shuttered in Hall County as the library system\u2019s budget fell to about $2.6 million this year from about $3.7 million in 2008.\nThe appeals for more funding for the library system during Monday\u2019s budget presentation were highlighted by young Josh Lander.\nAnd a double whammy of cuts from the local and state level \u201cmade it really difficult\u201d for the library system in recent years, said Hall County Commission Chairman Richard Mecum."}
