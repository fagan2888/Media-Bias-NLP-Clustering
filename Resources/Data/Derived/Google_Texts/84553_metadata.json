Associated Press/John Bazemore\n\nAfter losing a bid to buy the Los Angeles Clippers last year, Ares Management co-founder and Chief Executive Tony Ressler finally got into the NBA owner club this month, leading a group that bought the Atlanta Hawks for $850 million.\n\nThe size of the deal, while no comparison to the $2 billion paid for the Clippers by former Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer, isn\u2019t shabby either for an NBA franchise that isn\u2019t located in a top-tier market such as New York, Los Angeles or Chicago.\n\nMuch like today\u2019s buyout market, to which Mr. Ressler is no stranger, a little too much capital is chasing a limited number of deals in the sports arena.\n\n\u201cThere are only so many NBA teams out there for sale,\u201d said Jimmy Lynn, special adviser to Georgetown University\u2019s sports industry management program. He said Mr. Ballmer\u2019s $2 billion price tag for Clippers also helped raised the bar for asset prices.\n\nStill, Mr. Lynn said he thinks the $850 million price for Hawks is justified, citing factors such as a new broadcast deal NBA signed last year with sports network ESPN, as well as \u201cthe size of the [Atlanta] market, and a team that should be in the playoffs for the next few years.\u201d\n\nThe nine-year deal ESPN announced with NBA last October, valued at $2.66 billion a year, extends ESPN\u2019s rights to cover NBA games through television, digital, data, audio and other channels starting in the 2016-2017 season. The new deal almost tripled ESPN\u2019s revenue from broadcasting NBA games, according to Mr. Lynn.\n\n\u201cOwners of NBA teams get a percentage of the TV revenue,\u201d Mr. Lynn said. On top of that, he said owners also receive cuts of revenue from ticket sales, merchandising and sponsorship.\n\nMr. Ressler joins a long and expanding list of private equity practitioners who count NBA teams among their personal holdings: Avenue Capital co-founder and Chief Executive Marc Lasry and Fortress Investment Group co-founder Wesley Edens, for instance, acquired the Milwaukee Bucks for $550 million last year.\n\nThe Philadelphia 76ers count Blackstone Group Senior Managing Director David Blitzer and Apollo Global Management co-founder Joshua Harris among the team\u2019s owners. The Detroit Pistons are controlled by Platinum Equity founder Tom Gores, while the Boston Celtics count Bain Capital Managing Director Stephen Pagliuca as a co-owner.\n\n\u201cThey have the money to invest,\u201d David Carter, executive director of University of Southern California\u2019s Marshall Sports Business Institute, wrote in an email.\n\n\u201cTop private equity execs are interested in parlaying their success in one intense and competitive industry into another\u2014sports franchise ownership,\u201d Prof. Carter wrote, adding the ownership \u201callows them to have some high profile fun.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn short, those in private equity, like so many others, covet owning a trophy asset.\u201d\n\nIt is hard to determine whether these basketball investments are for purely personal or investment purposes; often, they are both. Speaking at the Dow Jones Private Equity Analyst Conference in 2012, Apollo\u2019s Mr. Harris admitted that his purchase of the 76ers was \u201cboth an investment and a hobby.\u201d\n\nMr. Lynn said these basketball deals, if priced correctly, make good economic sense, pointing out the potential to expand the teams\u2019 reach in countries like China and Taiwan, where NBA players like Yao Ming and Jeremy Lin are treated like idols.\n\n\u201cThis is a sport that\u2019s globally popular,\u201d said Mr. Lynn. \u201cFrom PE perspective, it\u2019s a good investment.\u201d\n\nThe investment could look even more lucrative depending on the outcome of the NBA playoffs. The Hawks, which are leading the Brooklyn Nets 2-0 in in the first round of the 2015 Eastern Conference playoffs, head to the Barclays Center Saturday for game three.\n\nWrite to Shasha Dai at shasha.dai@wsj.com Follow her on Twitter at @ShashaDai1", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "After losing a bid to buy the Los Angeles Clippers last year, Ares Management co-founder and Chief Executive Tony Ressler finally got into the NBA owner club this month, leading a group that bought the Atlanta Hawks for $850 million.", "title": "Will Tony Ressler\u2019s Bet on Atlanta Hawks Be a Slam Dunk or Air Ball?", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2015/04/24/will-tony-resslers-bet-on-atlanta-hawks-be-a-slam-dunk-or-air-ball/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-IB854_HAWKS_P_20150424172548.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "Will Tony Ressler\u2019s Bet on Atlanta Hawks Be a Slam Dunk or Air Ball?", "description": "After losing a bid to buy the Los Angeles Clippers last year, Ares Management co-founder and Chief Executive Tony Ressler finally got into the NBA owner club this month, leading a group that bought the Atlanta Hawks for $850 million.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Shasha Dai", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Private Equity Beat Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Private Equity Beat", "article.summary": "After losing a bid to buy the Los Angeles Clippers last year, Ares Management co-founder and Chief Executive Tony Ressler finally got into the NBA owner club this month, leading a group that bought the Atlanta Hawks for $850 million.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2015-04-24T22:15:12-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-142", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2015/04/24/will-tony-resslers-bet-on-atlanta-hawks-be-a-slam-dunk-or-air-ball/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-PEBB-18363", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "After losing a bid to buy the Los Angeles Clippers last year, Ares Management co-founder and Chief Executive Tony Ressler finally got into the NBA owner club this month, leading a group that bought the Atlanta Hawks for $850 million.", "title": "Will Tony Ressler\u2019s Bet on Atlanta Hawks Be a Slam Dunk or Air Ball?", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2015/04/24/will-tony-resslers-bet-on-atlanta-hawks-be-a-slam-dunk-or-air-ball/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-IB854_HAWKS_P_20150424172548.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Private Equity Beat", "article.id": "BL-PEBB-18363", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-04-27T17:27:40-04:00"}, "article_summary": "\u201cOwners of NBA teams get a percentage of the TV revenue,\u201d Mr. Lynn said.\n\u201cThere are only so many NBA teams out there for sale,\u201d said Jimmy Lynn, special adviser to Georgetown University\u2019s sports industry management program.\n\u201cThis is a sport that\u2019s globally popular,\u201d said Mr. Lynn.\nAtlanta Hawks forward DeMarre Carroll drives against Brooklyn Nets forward Joe Johnson in the first half of an NBA playoff game in Atlanta April 19.\nThe new deal almost tripled ESPN\u2019s revenue from broadcasting NBA games, according to Mr. Lynn."}
