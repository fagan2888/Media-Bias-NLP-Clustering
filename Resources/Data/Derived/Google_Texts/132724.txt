Conway Springs is currently without power after strong winds damage trees and knock down power lines.

Conway Springs Police Officer Landon Wisely tells KAKE News that trees fell on power lines and blocking roads and alley ways.

"We've had big tree limbs down, snapped power lines and a couple fires from trees catching power lines and bringing them down," Officer Wisely said.

Power was knocked out in the area before 10 a.m.

Wisely estimates wind gusts between 70 and 80 mph knocked the trees down.

There were no reported injuries, but there were reports of damage to property.
