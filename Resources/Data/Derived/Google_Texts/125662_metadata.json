January is the high season for elected officials to offer addresses on how our state is faring \u2014 overviews of California, and its local governments. And, to be clear, I am not judging the sanity of Californians (we have lower rates of mental illness than the U.S). Nor am I referring merely to the startling growth in almond production.\n\nI offer my assessment of our essential nuttiness as a starting point for a year in which we will debate and cast votes on our taxes, drug laws, schools, roads, our rails and water. As we figure things out, let us not lean too heavily on reason, or appeal too often to common sense. After all, this state \u2014 with its peculiar history of rapid change \u2014 has never been a particularly reasonable or sensible place.\n\nSo when things make no sense in the coming year, take comfort in the words of the writer Edward Abbey: \u201cThere is science, logic, reason; there is thought verified by experience. And then there is California.\u201d\n\nWe have been so singular for so long that California has become obsessed with singularity \u2014 and even afraid of \u201cthe singularity,\u201d the idea that artificial intelligences will eventually surpass our own, dooming humanity. When Gov. Brown gives his own State of the State address, there likely will be a predictable list of California singular-status boasts: as a leader in renewable energy, high-speed rail, protecting undocumented immigrants, and fighting climate change.\n\nSuch policies are to be celebrated. They also are the fruits of our perceived nuttiness \u2014 other states have rejected high-speed rail and cap-and-trade for greenhouse gas emissions as irretrievably wacky ideas.\n\nYou won\u2019t hear this month\u2019s official speechmakers talk about the other half of the nut \u2014 the way our nuttiness can turn on itself.\n\nOurs is a state of creative communities and people that is ruled from Sacramento via the most centralized regime of regulation and taxation in the United States.\n\nCalifornia has the highest percentage of its population living in poverty of any state in the country, and yet our leaders pursue policies that give us some of America\u2019s most expensive electricity, gas and housing. We embrace freedom and restrict it in the same breath. Californians are on our way to legalizing marijuana \u2014 but good luck finding a place in the state where you can smoke it, or anything else. The state is pioneering self-driving cars \u2014 even as we let our roads deteriorate into impassable messes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe\u2019ve led the way in expanding health insurance for poor people \u2014 half of our children are now on Medi-Cal, California\u2019s version of Medicaid \u2014 but at the same time, we\u2019ve made it harder for people to get treatment. California desperately needs more college graduates \u2014 so, naturally, we under-fund public higher education and limit college enrollment.\n\nWe Californians have a nutty weakness for empty and extravagant promises. We spend years on Elon Musk\u2019s waiting lists for Teslas he can\u2019t seem to deliver. Our governments are going to provide billions in retiree health car even in an age when Medicare and Obamacare should cover all. And from Silicon Valley to Hollywood, we invest billions in the trivial \u2014 how many photo sharing-apps and superhero movies does one state need?\n\nI could go on \u2014 take note that I\u2019ve gone this far in a column about California nuttiness without once mentioning San Francisco \u2014 but what\u2019s the point? While our nuttiness has its costs, California will cope, as we always do, by celebrating how crazily creative we are.\n\nAs Compton\u2019s Kendrick Lamar will rap when he wins big at this year\u2019s Grammys, \u201cWe gon\u2019 be alright.\u201d\n\nJoe Mathews wrote this column for Zocalo Public Square.", "article_metadata": {"description": "My fellow Californians, the state of our state is nuttier than ever.I know you will hear more conventional assessments of the state of things in the coming weeks.
