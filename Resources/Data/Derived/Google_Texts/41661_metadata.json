John Barrasso, R-Wyo.\n\nOfficials representing United Nations member states will gather in Paris from Nov. 30 to Dec. 11 to negotiate an international agreement for reducing emissions of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas emitted from coal and other fossil fuels.\n\nTo avoid the objection of congressional Republicans, the Obama administration has indicated it plans to negotiate the deal in a way where it would not be submitted to Congress as a legally binding treaty, which must be approved by two-thirds of the Senate.\n\nUnder the plan, reported by the New York Times, countries would be legally mandated to implement climate change policies, and possibly agree to a timetable to do so. But the countries would only voluntarily commit to specific amounts of emissions reductions.\n\nThe Obama administration would argue that the broad pledges by countries to address climate change by reducing emissions \u2014 without committing to specific levels \u2014 is already legally protected under an existing 1992 treaty.\n\nBy not making the deal legally binding, the Obama administration would essentially be agreeing to a \u201cpolitical commitment\u201d or \u201csole executive agreement\u201d, according to Julian Ku, a professor of constitutional law at Hofstra University, who testified at the hearing.\n\n\u201cI believe the Paris agreement should be submitted to the Senate as a treaty if it has legally binding emissions targets and timetables,\u201d Ku told lawmakers. He added:\n\nBut I do not have a constitutional objection if the agreement is merely a political commitment that is not binding under international law, as long as the U.S. government declares which parts of the agreement are legally binding, and which parts are not. The Senate can play an important role by forcing clarity and transparency from the administration.\n\nKu said future presidents would not need to adhere to the agreement if it were not legally binding.\n\n\u201cA sole executive agreement is the weakest commitment we can make,\u201d Ku said. \u201cThere are a lot of them, but they are usually for small things. If other presidents withdraw from the agreement, there is a cost to it, because other countries get upset about that. That\u2019s why the use of an executive agreement has to be done carefully.\u201d\n\nDemocrats on the committee argue there\u2019s plenty of precedent for a president to adopt executive agreements without Senate consent, and that the urgency of the climate change issue should give Obama flexibility to negotiate how he wishes.\n\nCiting a 2015 Congressional Research Service report, Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., said the U.S. has produced 18,500 executive agreements since 1789, compared to 1,100 treaties.\n\n\u201cI think there is plenty of precedent to take this next step in Paris and what flows from that as an executive agreement,\u201d Carper told The Daily Signal.\n\nIn his remarks at the hearing, Carper elaborated:\n\n\u201cThe science is clear that future generations face no greater environmental threat than the threat of climate change,\u201d he said. \u201cThe price of action pales to the cost of doing nothing. The U.S. can\u2019t do it alone, but we can provide leadership. I have confidence this administration working in conjunction with [other] laboratories of democracy will find the right recipe.\u201d\n\nEven though he has the support of his party, Obama is facing pushback from Republicans who want to undermine the president\u2019s negotiating authority when he travels to Paris later this month.\n\nIn addition to to their concerns about the mechanism by which the agreement is negotiated, Republicans are also worried about money.\n\nIn a letter to be sent to Obama Thursday, Barrasso and Sen. Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., pledge to block funding to the \u201cGreen Climate Fund\u201d, where developed countries would aim to contribute $100 billion per year by 2020, from both public and private sources, to developing nations to help them combat climate change.\n\nObama has already pledged $3 billion, but Republicans have blocked efforts to appropriate the money.\n\n\u201cTo impose this kind of cost on the economy when there are no realistic expectations for other countries to meet its requirements is not wise,\u201d said Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala.\n\nDespite the concerns over cost, Lisa Jacobson, the president of the Business Council of Sustainable Energy, told the committee a climate deal would boost investment in clean-energy technologies, which she says would produce savings down the road.\n\n\u201cJust the fact that such a large scope of countries [have released] adaptation plans is a major breakthrough,\u201d Jacobson said. \u201cAs companies, we see that as an important market signal and respond to that. When we see 160 countries say they want to lower carbon emissions, we will step up to help them reach their goals.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, on Tuesday night, the Senate voted to strike down two components of Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan, which would cut carbon emissions from existing power plants, and set restrictions for new power plants.\n\nThe House is expected to approve its own resolution closer or during the Paris climate summit. Obama is expected to veto the measures, and lawmakers do not have the votes to overturn it.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Senate Republicans say they will fight the Obama administration for the right to review an international climate deal expected to be struck next month.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Senate Republicans say they will fight the Obama administration for the right to review an international climate deal expected to be struck next month.", "title": "Republicans Won't Fund Obama\u2019s International Climate Deal", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/ClimateHearing.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-11-19T13:46:34+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1OfK2tY"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Senate Republicans say they will fight the Obama administration for the right to review an international climate deal expected to be struck next month.", "title": "Republicans Won't Fund Obama\u2019s International Climate Deal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/ClimateHearing.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Energy", "tag": "climate change", "published_time": "2015-11-18T17:40:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-19T13:46:34+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "climate change, President Obama, climate change, John Barrasso,  Tom Carper, Jim Inhofe, Clean Power Plan, United Nations, global warming"}, "article_summary": "The House is expected to approve its own resolution closer or during the Paris climate summit.\nSenate Republicans emphasized Wednesday that they will fight the Obama administration for the right to review an international climate deal expected to be struck in Paris next month.\n\u201cA sole executive agreement is the weakest commitment we can make,\u201d Ku said.\n\u201cI believe the Paris agreement should be submitted to the Senate as a treaty if it has legally binding emissions targets and timetables,\u201d Ku told lawmakers.\n\u201cI think there is plenty of precedent to take this next step in Paris and what flows from that as an executive agreement,\u201d Carper told The Daily Signal."}
