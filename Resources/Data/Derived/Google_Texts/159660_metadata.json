A team of bishops is expected to begin its work next year, but there is no deadline for an updated version of the directives.\n\n\u201cAbout a year ago, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops\u2019 Subcommittee on Health Care, which I chair, learned about a situation involving a Catholic health-care network that raised moral and canonical questions,\u201d Bishop Robert McManus of Worcester, Mass., told the Register.\n\nThe USCCB contacted the Vatican for guidance. But instead of providing a simple Yes or No answer to the question about whether the specific merger should be approved, said Bishop McManus, the CDF provided the list of principles to be applied in the moral evaluation of various Catholic-secular partnerships.\n\n\u201cWhile it is commendable and, in some cases, important for the viability of a Catholic health-care institution to enter into collaborative relationships with non-Catholic partners, the question is whether it is morally possible,\u201d said Bishop McManus.\n\nThe Vatican document does not reject such arrangements, but it also urges all those responsible for approving these partnerships to \u201censure that the Church\u2019s involvement in health care does not give scandal.\u201d\n\nRapid Change and Shifting Alliances\n\nAmid an era of rapid change and shifting alliances in the health-care sector, further advanced by the 2010 passage of the Affordable Care Act, both the U.S. bishops and Catholic hospitals have struggled to apply the \"Ethical and Religious Directives\" to collaborative ventures that have been established to keep Church-affiliated providers financially competitive.\n\nStandalone Catholic hospitals have long given way to networks that span multiple states and dioceses. New financial incentives have led Catholic networks to acquire secular hospitals, establish insurance plans that take advantage of favorable rates generated by their networks and contract with physicians who may also provide services for secular employers.\n\nBut, according to Bishop McManus, the clear message from the CDF is that financial concerns cannot override serious moral considerations.\n\n\u201cAs long as fundamental principles of cooperation are applied correctly, it may be possible for a Catholic institution to enter into collaborative relationships with non-Catholic partners,\u201d said Bishop McManus, summing up the CDF instruction.\n\n\u201cBut the Catholic entity also has to be careful of the possibility of scandal \u2014 defined as \u2018creating a situation that might lead others into sin.\u2019\u201d\n\nDispute Over Dignity Health\n\nDuring an interview with the Register, Bishop McManus noted that the 2012 decision to restructure San Francisco-based Catholic Healthcare West network into the non-Catholic entity Dignity Health had prompted the USCCB to seek further direction from the Vatican.\n\nCatholic Healthcare West \u201cproposed to reorganize and redefine itself as a secular, nonprofit health-care system [Dignity Health] governed by a self-perpetuating board and changed its name to reflect that new status,\u201d explained Father Tad Pacholczyk, director of education for the National Catholic Bioethics Center, which advises U.S. dioceses and Catholic health-care executives on such matters.\n\n\u201cThis would enable secular hospitals to join Dignity Health without requiring that they discontinue performing direct sterilizations. Hospitals that had been Catholic under CHW would remain so under Dignity Health and still would not engage in direct sterilizations.\u201d\n\nIn 2012, said Father Pacholczyk, \u201cthen-Archbishop George Niederauer of San Francisco determined that the proposed restructuring of CHW would be consistent with Catholic moral and doctrinal teachings and that the sponsors and their Catholic hospitals would, therefore, be free to participate in it.\u201d\n\nBut other bishops and moral theologians disputed that judgment, and so the USCCB sought guidance from Rome, which opted to provide the 17 principles to be applied to a variety of problematic cases.\n\nNational Catholic Bioethics Center's president, John Haas, emphasized that the CDF\u2019s \u201cSome Principles for Collaboration With Non-Catholic Entities for the Provision of Healthcare Services\u201d do not repudiate the ERDs\u2019 previous guidance on the formation of such partnerships.\n\n\u201cThe ERDs are not out of line. It would be a matter of tightening them up,\u201d said Haas.\n\nAcceptable and Unacceptable Partnerships\n\nAsked to outline the kind of partnership that would likely win approval, Haas offered a straightforward example \u2014 \u201ca Catholic and non-Catholic hospital want to share a common laundry facility, which could save them millions a year.\u201d\n\nBut if the collaboration included a shared pharmacy, where oral contraceptives were dispensed, the Catholic health-care provider \u201cwould be violating principles [that bar] material cooperation,\u201d said Haas.\n\nThe National Catholic Bioethics Center explains that the \u201cprinciple of cooperation in evil has been developed in the Catholic moral tradition as a guide to assist with the identification of different types of cooperation and the conditions under which cooperation may or may not be tolerated.\u201d\n\nAn increasingly common issue, Haas said, is a Catholic health-care network seeking to acquire a community hospital.\n\n\u201cThe Catholic health system says, \u2018We will have nothing to do with the community hospital if they perform abortions, but since tubal ligations are not so grave \u2026 they can go ahead and do that,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nHaas has challenged such proposals when clients request his guidance.\n\n\u201cIf a community hospital is owned, operated, managed and financed by a Catholic system, it is a Catholic hospital,\u201d he has told clients, and so they cannot allow the provision of tubal ligations.\n\nAffordable Care Act\n\nHaas noted that Catholic health systems also are grappling with the moral problems associated with the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which has embraced contraception and sterilization as basic healthcare, and authorized the Health and Human Services contraception mandate without adequate conscience protections for religious non-profits.\n\nMeanwhile, some \u201creproductive rights\u201d activists have sought to block efforts by Catholic networks to acquire secular hospitals because the new owners would no longer permit direct abortion and other services. Indeed, a 2013 article in Mother Jones, \"Do Bishops Run Your Hospital?\" asserted that \"hospital mergers have allowed the bishops to accomplish in practice what they haven't been able to achieve through the political process: making abortion and contraception harder to access.\"\n\nHowever, the ACA has also offered new opportunities for hospital networks, both Catholic and secular, by boosting reimbursement rates to hospitals and dramatically increasing the pool of insured patients. \u201cThe Congressional Budget Office estimates that 170 million people will have coverage through Medicare, Medicaid and the insurance exchanges by 2023, an increase of about 50% from 2013. By contrast, the number of people with employer-based coverage is expected to rise just 2%, to 159 million,\u201d reported The New York Times in a Nov. 17 story.\n\nPrivate health-insurance companies have already experienced a surge in policyholders, inspiring Catholic hospital systems to get into the insurance business with the hope of using the power of their multistate networks to control costs and attract consumers.\n\nBut the potential benefits of such a move also come with moral considerations, given that the HHS mandate now requires all insurers to provide co-pay-free contraception and surgical sterilization.\n\nJ.D. Flynn, a canon lawyer in the Diocese of Lincoln, Neb., said the Vatican instruction would help the U.S. bishops and health-care executives evaluate the structures that have been created to \u201cdistance\u201d Catholic entities from problematic initiatives and policies.\n\n\u201cThere is concern about the third-party administrators that Catholic hospital networks are using as they expand into health insurance,\u201d Flynn told the Register.\n\n\u201cIn some cases, Catholic insurance companies contract with a third-party administrator to provide contraception or other morally objectionable services. The end result is that some Catholic health insurance plans facilitate access to morally objectionable service,\u201d Flynn added.\n\n\u201cThe question is whether helping people to obtain and pay for immoral services constitutes \u2018cooperation\u2019 in providing those services. Moral theologians tend to agree with the commonsense conclusion that it does.\u201d\n\nPreserving a \u2018Prophetic\u2019 Witness\n\nChristian Brugger, professor of moral theology at St. John Vianney Theological Seminary in Denver, told the Register that he welcomed the Vatican\u2019s emphasis on the \u201cprophetic\u201d witness of Catholic health care.\n\n\u201cThe issue of maintaining the integrity of our Catholic witness is what is most directly at stake in collaborations between Catholic and non-Catholic health-care networks,\u201d said Brugger.\n\n\u201cIt seems to be a new time in Catholic health care, where our bishops are saying: The example matters,\u201d Brugger concluded.\n\n\u201cEven if you can work out an administrative structure where the evildoing is far from you, if people will be alienated from the Gospel because of the confusing example it gives, the arrangement will still compromise the duty you have as a Catholic health-care ministry to participate in the Church\u2019s Great Commission.\u201d\n\nJoan Frawley Desmond is the Register\u2019s senior editor.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The moral questions that such partnerships can generate have drawn the attention of both the\u2026", "og": {"site_name": "National Catholic Register", "description": "The moral questions that such partnerships can generate have drawn the attention of both the Vatican and the U.S. bishops.", "title": "Catholic-Secular Health-Care Partnerships Prompt Scrutiny", "url": "http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/catholic-secular-health-care-partnerships-prompt-scrutiny/", "image": "http://www.ncregister.com/images/uploads/shutterstock_healthcare.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/catholic-secular-health-care-partnerships-prompt-scrutiny/", "image": "http://www.ncregister.com/images/uploads/shutterstock_healthcare.jpg", "description": "The moral questions that such partnerships can generate have drawn the attention of both the Vatican and the U.S. bishops.", "card": "summary", "title": "Catholic-Secular Health-Care Partnerships Prompt Scrutiny"}, "fb": {"admins": 1477213784, "app_id": 347756275321330}, "keywords": "National Catholic Register, bishop robert mcmanus, catholic healthcare, congregation for the doctrine of the faith, ethical and religious directives, healthcare mergers, joan frawley desmond, u.s. bishops, usccb", "google-site-verification": "fH2AP0niyimtMl7gbXZxEEOYh0-SDCGbWnO5xzGZ7Ag", "verify-v1": "YalzSEdGEZFJXAYZujFlKPI/ZbVQzE2JcUWO5z743BQ="}, "article_summary": "The end result is that some Catholic health insurance plans facilitate access to morally objectionable service,\u201d Flynn added.\n\u201cThe issue of maintaining the integrity of our Catholic witness is what is most directly at stake in collaborations between Catholic and non-Catholic health-care networks,\u201d said Brugger.\n\u201cIt seems to be a new time in Catholic health care, where our bishops are saying: The example matters,\u201d Brugger concluded.\n\u201cThere is concern about the third-party administrators that Catholic hospital networks are using as they expand into health insurance,\u201d Flynn told the Register.\n\u201cThis would enable secular hospitals to join Dignity Health without requiring that they discontinue performing direct sterilizations."}
