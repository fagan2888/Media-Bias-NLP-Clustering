In states that opted not to expand the program, the increase was much smaller at 2.8 percent.\n\nSabrina Corlette, a senior research fellow at the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University, described the difference as \u201cstark,\u201d adding, \u201cit suggests that in the Medicaid expansion states, people are accessing the health care system. They are seeing physicians and other prescribers and getting needed drugs.\u201d\n\nThe report also provided some new details on the overall growth of spending on prescription drugs, which, it said, rose substantially in 2014 \u2014 by 13.1 percent, to $373.9 billion. The increase is the highest since 2001 \u2014 mainly because of the arrival of expensive new drugs for conditions like hepatitis C, cancer and multiple sclerosis, at the same time that sales eroded less for brand-name drugs because of new competition with generic drugs. Spending on so-called specialty drugs \u2014 high-priced treatments that typically treat serious chronic diseases \u2014 accounted for one-third of drug spending in 2014, up from 23 percent five years ago.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLast year \u201cwas a remarkable year in terms of growth in spending on medicines,\u201d said Murray Aitken, executive director of the IMS Institute. But he added that while growth in specialty drug spending was expected to continue, the eye-popping increase in 2014 was unique and spending would most likely not rise as sharply in future years.\n\nThe report sheds some light on who enrolled in coverage through the new marketplaces. The IMS Institute found that 70 percent of people who used a marketplace plan to fill a prescription in 2014 had been covered by commercial insurance in 2013, either through an employer or through purchasing an individual plan. Nearly a quarter \u2014 24 percent \u2014 paid cash in 2013, meaning they may have been uninsured. In all, the number of prescriptions paid in 2014 with cash declined by 5.5 percent compared to 2013.\n\nSteven Jacobsohn, a retired financial analyst who lives in Manhattan, said his prescription drug coverage improved in 2014, when he switched from individual coverage through EmblemHealth to a less expensive marketplace plan sold by Health Republic. He said two common generic drugs to treat high cholesterol and blood pressure cost $10 a month under his old policy, but were free under the Health Republic plan. \u201cIt\u2019s a very good plan,\u201d said Mr. Jacobsohn, who is 57.\n\nBut even as some have seen their options improve, the report found that many are cutting back on prescription drug use and doctor visits. Many marketplace plans \u2014 and, increasingly, plans through employers \u2014 come with high deductibles and co-payments, forcing some patients to make tough choices.\n\nOver all, patients made 3 percent fewer office visits and had 1.7 percent fewer hospital admissions. They filled slightly more prescriptions \u2014 2.1 percent \u2014 but that was mainly driven by the large increases among Medicaid patients, the report found.\n\nResearchers found that patients who took one type of diabetes drug were less likely to take the drug after their own costs reached $30, and even more so when their costs exceeded $125. Patients who had recently changed to a plan with a deductible took their drug for 25 fewer days, on average, compared to those with more comprehensive plans.\n\nGary Claxton, a vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, said it was difficult to generalize about consumers\u2019 coverage under high-deductible plans because they can vary widely in how they are set up. Still, he said, previous studies support the idea that \u201cwith more cost-sharing, you get less use.\u201d\n\nMr. Jacobsohn counts himself among patients who have let costs drive his health care decisions. Last year, he said, his doctor suggested that he switch from his generic atorvastatin prescription to Crestor, a more expensive brand-name drug, because his cholesterol was too high. When he learned that the Crestor prescription came with a $60 co-payment, Mr. Jacobsohn said he decided to wait six months to give the cheaper drug another chance to work. His cholesterol improved at the next visit and he never switched to Crestor.\n\n\u201cNot that I couldn\u2019t afford it,\u201d Mr. Jacobsohn said. \u201cI just didn\u2019t know if I wanted to pay for it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20150414000118, "twitter": {"description": "In the IMS study, patients with Medicaid in states that expanded access to the program filled 25.4
