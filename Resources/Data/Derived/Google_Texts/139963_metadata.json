KOMUnews, CC BY 2.0\n\n(Reuters Health) \u2013 The number of people going to U.S. emergency rooms for constipation has been going up, and so has the cost of those visits, which reached $1.6 billion in 2011, according to a new study.\n\n\u201cConstipation is often thought of as not a serious disease \u2013 particularly among doctors. Patients complain about it but it\u2019s often not thought of as being medically that relevant,\u201d said Dr. Anthony Lembo, the study\u2019s senior author from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.\n\nHis team\u2019s previous research found that a large number of people were being hospitalized for constipation, and that led them to examine ER visits for the same issue, Lembo told Reuters Health in a phone interview.\n\n\u201cA lot of these people don\u2019t end up getting admitted, obviously, but they\u2019re seen in the ER,\u201d he said.\n\nConstipation affects an estimated 12 to 19 percent of the U.S. population, Lembo and colleagues write in The American Journal of Gastroenterology. Symptoms include having fewer than three bowel movements a week, or hard, dry and small bowel movements that are painful or difficult to pass.\n\nUsing data from more than 950 U.S. hospitals, the researchers estimated that there were 497,034 ER visits for constipation during 2006. In 2011, there were 703,391 visits, an increase of about 42 percent.\n\nThe increase in ER visits for constipation is greater than the 22 percent increase in overall ER visits during that time, the researchers write.\n\nInfants and the elderly were most likely to wind up in the ER for constipation, which mirrors the condition\u2019s prevalence in general, Lembo said.\n\nAccounting for inflation, the cost of those visits also rose by about 56 percent per patient, from about $1,500 in 2006 to about $2,300 in 2011.\n\nAbout $1.6 billion was spent on ER care for constipation in 2011, according to those numbers.\n\nThe study can\u2019t explain why people come to the ER with constipation, Lembo said. They may have symptoms such as severe abdominal pain, he said.\n\nHis team thinks there are probably several reasons why visits for constipation increased, including an increase in the number of people on government-funded insurance.\n\nThose people may be more likely to seek treatment at an ER and less likely to purchase over-the-counter treatments for constipation, the researchers write.\n\nThe new study highlights that constipation is a growing healthcare issue in the U.S., said Dr. JoAnn Kwah, a gastroenterologist at Montefiore Medical Center in Bronx, New York.\n\n\u201cOne important thing to know about constipation is that it can be due to many different underlying causes so in order to minimize developing this disease, it would be important to know why it's occurring in the first place,\u201d she told Reuters Health in an email.\n\nHealth conditions or medications may cause constipation, said Kwah, who wasn\u2019t involved with the new study. People having issues with constipation should review their medication list with their physician, she said.\n\nConstipation can also be caused by a lack of dietary fiber and Kwah suggests people keep up with the recommended fiber intake of 25 to 30 grams a day.\n\n\u201cThis can be done by increasing the amounts of fruits and vegetables in one's diet, as well as supplementing one's diet with fiber supplements available from local pharmacies,\u201d she said.\n\nDehydration may also lead to constipation, Kwah said.\n\nSOURCE: http://bit.ly/1I0boDJ The American Journal of Gastroenterology, online March 24, 2015.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "constipation, symptoms, american, er, visits, constipation, are, rise", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The number of people going to U.S. emergency rooms for constipation has been going up, and so has the cost of those visits.", "title": "ER Visits For Constipation Are On The Rise", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/constipation-symptoms-american-er-visits-constipation-are-rise-327834", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/01/er-visits-constipation.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The number of people going to U.S. emergency rooms for constipation has been going up, and so has the cost of those visits.", "title": "ER Visits For Constipation Are On The Rise", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/constipation-symptoms-american-er-visits-constipation-are-rise-327834", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/01/er-visits-constipation.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/01/er-visits-constipation.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-04-01T16:39:24-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-01T16:39:23-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The number of people going to U.S. emergency rooms for constipation has been going up, and so has the cost of those visits."}, "article_summary": "The increase in ER visits for constipation is greater than the 22 percent increase in overall ER visits during that time, the researchers write.\nUsing data from more than 950 U.S. hospitals, the researchers estimated that there were 497,034 ER visits for constipation during 2006.\nThe study can\u2019t explain why people come to the ER with constipation, Lembo said.\nDehydration may also lead to constipation, Kwah said.\nThe number of people going to U.S. emergency rooms for constipation has been going up, and so has the cost of those visits."}
