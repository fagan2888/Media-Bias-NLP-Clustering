Critics of Ted Cruz say he loves to fight and debate but never wins or accomplishes anything. They point to his well-publicized, but fruitless, efforts to defund Obamacare and Planned Parenthood.

Perhaps in response to this argument, the Republican presidential candidate is running a new ad in Iowa portraying himself as a winner on social and cultural issues that appeal to conservative voters.

The 30-second ad, titled “Victories,” is set to run statewide in Iowa through Jan. 3rd, according to his campaign.

The ad goes:

Defended the cross. And won. Protected the Ten Commandments. And won. Fought for the Second Amendment. And won. Stood up for the Pledge of Allegiance. And won.

But how is he able to say he’s won on these issues? Cruz’s campaign says the ad is referring to his past efforts “defending the Mojave Memorial Cross, the Texas Capitol Ten Commandments monument, the Second Amendment, and the words ‘under God’ in the Pledge of Allegiance.”

The ad comes as Cruz continues to lead his rivals in polls in Iowa, which votes Feb. 1.
