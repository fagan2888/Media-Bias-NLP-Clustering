At 28 years old, Pratt has had five surgeries to remove the tumor, and though on the road to recovery she faces years of check-ups and treatments to ensure she stays well.\n\nThat\u2019s already somewhat jarring for young woman. Maybe it should have prepared her for what she saw when she went to the doctor last week. That\u2019s where she got another shock: the cost of some of her care now that Obamacare had started taking effect.\n\nEven more surprising? Initially, Pratt said she noticed that her insurance premiums went down \u2014 $14 per month to be exact. She received a 30-or-so-page booklet detailing in small print the changes to her plan that would come under Obamacare. But she didn\u2019t look closely enough to avoid her recent sticker shock.\n\nLast week Pratt visited her primary care physician with a sore throat. It was strep. At the receptionist\u2019s window and afterward at the pharmacy to fill a prescription, Pratt learned just how much more she would be paying for care.\n\n\u201cMy copay for seeing the doctor went up $30 to $60. My copay for prescriptions went up $20 to $60 as well,\u201d Pratt told TheBlaze.\n\nBut that\u2019s not even the kicker. Having an MRI, something Pratt will need once a year for the next five years to monitor her brain, went from an $800 copay to $2,200.\n\nAfter seeing these costs, Pratt wrote to a contact she had from when she had interned in the office of Rep. Ken Calvert (R-Calif.).\n\n\u201cThe response I got back was \u2018yeah, we get this all the time. There\u2019s nothing really we can do,\u201d Pratt recounted. \u201cIt was so bland and not really compassionate.\u201d\n\nSo, she thought \u201cOK, this is my life now, I have to figure a way around.\u201d\n\nA brain tumor at 24\n\nWhen the woman from Corona, Calif., graduated with her undergraduate degree from The King\u2019s College in New York and entered the working world, she had a hard time finding a full-time job. She went back to the fast-food restaurant where she worked in high school and took a part-time position.\n\nThis part-time job at the fast-food chain, even after she worked her way up into the corporate office, didn\u2019t provide medical insurance, though. Pratt said being 24 years old at the time, she wanted to be responsible and purchase her own insurance.\n\nAt the same time, she was experiencing pain. She remembers having headaches back into her college years.\n\n\u201cI kept thinking, it must be allergies or something,\u201d she said, noting that she took Claritin to try to combat what she thought was the issue.\n\nAfter graduating, she saw a few doctors about the pain, but didn\u2019t get anywhere.\n\n\u201cI got to point where I thought no one was listening to me,\u201d she said.\n\nFrustrated, Pratt cancelled the health insurance that was taking a chunk from her paycheck each month, but not for long.\n\n\u201cMy grandma called me and she was so mad at me. She yelled at me, and I called back and got my health care reinstated,\u201d Pratt said, noting that her grandmother also set her up with an appointment with her primary care physician.\n\nThat was all on a Wednesday in 2011. By Thursday, Pratt was in the doctor\u2019s office and had her head scanned as the doctor tried to figure out what might be ailing her for so long.\n\n\u201cI hadn\u2019t even left the pharmacy before he called back and said I had a brain tumor,\u201d she said.\n\nOn Friday, Pratt was in surgery to begin removing the 7.8-centimeter tumor that would be diagnosed as an extremely rare form of cancer as brain tumors go.\n\nPratt\u2019s benign tumor was removed in several surgeries with her fifth and final surgery in 2012 being to insert a shunt in her head to drain excess fluid that was building up. This shunt, though, uses magnets that need to be reset in a procedure every time she has an MRI, which for the woman already facing higher copays is just an another cost to add to the stack.\n\n\u201cI have to go to doctor fairly regularly, so I have to have expensive visits,\u201d she said.\n\n\u2018The road to hell is paved in good intentions\u2019\n\nPratt thinks Obamacare is impacting her pocketbook in more ways than one. In addition to facing steeper medical bills, she said her part-time work has been cut so her employer could avoid the provision requiring insurance for employees working 30 hours or more a week.\n\n\u201cBefore the [Affordable Care Act] I was working 35 hours a week, now I\u2019m working 24,\u201d Pratt, who works in the fast-food restaurant\u2019s customer service department, said.\n\nPratt said she is working on navigating how should could qualify through various aid programs and noted that she has tried to check out the health care options offered in the federal exchange. In the two times she has tried to log onto the state-based exchange website in the last two weeks, it hasn\u2019t worked, she said.\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act in general, I think, it\u2019s a great idea, but the road to hell is paved in good intentions. I don\u2019t think they expected the fallout from business in general,\u201d she said.\n\nThe fact that businesses have cut hours for part-time employees coupled with government mandated insurance and other factors, make the expense a difficult burden for some.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel the government should have a say in what you need to purchase when it comes to your own well being,\u201d Pratt, who is going back to school for a masters in social work, said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a good idea, but I don\u2019t see where the government has authority to step in and say what\u2019s good for you.\u201d\n\nShe also worries about doctors dropping out of the field in the aftermath of Obamacare.\n\n\u201cIf any of my specialists\u2026 decide that being a doctor is no longer profitable, then I\u2019ll loose two guys that I seriously trust, and are very familiar with my not so common case. The thought scares me to death,\u201d she said.\n\nFrom her perspective, Pratt is just \u201cjust trying to be responsible and take care of my body\u201d \u2014 and she wants to be able to pay for it.\n\n\u201cBefore [the Affordable Care Act,] the copays for certain services were still really expensive, but could go to the insurance company and say \u2018hey, I can\u2019t afford this\u2019 and they were helping me out. In the future, I dont know if they\u2019re going to do that.\u201d\n\nGlenn Beck interviewed Amanda Pratt on The Glenn Beck Program, and in a web-exclusive, on Monday.
