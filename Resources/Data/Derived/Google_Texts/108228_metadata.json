Even when accusing President Obama of lying, he cannot help lying.\n\nHere, to throw his own words back in Boehner\u2019s face, are five of this winter\u2019s biggest whoppers from Speaker Boehner:\n\n1. \u201cWe are always interested in promoting jobs here in the U.S. I\u2019ll go anywhere and do anything in terms of creating good American jobs\u201d (2/26/15). The Facts: This outrageous claim came just days after President Obama vetoed a bipartisan bill to approve the broadly popular Keystone XL pipeline. The president\u2019s own State Department says Keystone XL will support at least 42,000 American jobs.\n\nActual Facts: This from guy who is so focused on fake problems that in six years has yet to create a single job. Here we go again with the lie that the Keystone XL pipeline is a jobs bill, and that it is \u201cbroadly popular.\u201d It is neither. It is an enrich the Koch Brothers, John Boehner, and TransCanada Corp bill.\n\nNot to mention the fact that Obama said \u201cgood\u201d American jobs, and a few thousand part time jobs and 35 permanent jobs don\u2019t make the cut. As for popular, 61 percent of Americans support Obama, not Boehner. Boehner is also ignoring environmental issues and treaty rights (see Number 5, below).\n\n2. \u201cISIL is on the defensive\u2026\u201d (2/11/15). The Facts: This week ISIL \u201cabducted at least 70 Christians, including women and children, after overrunning a string of villages in northeastern Syria,\u201d USA TODAY reports. The terror group is expanding into Libya, attackers recently infiltrated an Iraqi base where U.S. troops are stationed, and even members of the President\u2019s own Party are now talking about \u201cmixed messages,\u201d \u201ca lack of confidence\u201d and the need for the administration to put forward \u201can effective winning strategy\u201d to defeat these barbaric Islamic extremists.\n\nActual Facts: You would think only Christians suffer at the hands of the Islamic State. ISIL has been waging unrestricted war against Muslims and Christian casualties are a definite minority. That is not to downplay these tragic events, but even Hitler, when on the overall strategic defensive, was able to put together the Ardennes Offensive, better known to Americans as the Battle of the Bulge, not to mention a counterattack or two against the advancing Soviet armies.\n\nBeohner and his fellow \u201chawks\u201d will not be satisfied unless America enters into another ruinous war where other people go and fight and die. And why? Lindsey Graham hiding under his bed in fear of ISIL aside, more Americans have been killed in lethal attacks in the United States by right wing terrorists than by jihadists. And it is hardly a coincidence that the Department of Homeland Security says right wing terrorists are an equal or greater threat to Americans than ISIL.\n\nFinally, since Boehner is all about popular support, even when he has to lie about it, 54 percent of Americans have President Obama\u2019s back where ISIL is concerned. How that must rankle with a guy who can\u2019t even pass his own bills in the House of which he is Speaker.\n\n3. \u201cIf we were just rewriting the immigration laws, then the other side would have a case. We can\u2019t violate statutes\u2026 what we can do is make choices to implement those laws\u201d(2/25/15). The Facts: President Obama desperately wants to justify his unilateral actions on immigration. Unfortunately for the president, he\u2019s admitted at least 22 times that he didn\u2019t have the authority to do exactly what he eventually did.\n\nActual Facts: In fact-checking this claim when made by Gregg Abbot, Politifact found that the statement is \u201cmostly true\u201d with some provisos, including the fact that there were only 15 instances, not 22, adding that the claim \u201cneeds clarification or additional information.\u201d The fact remains that Obama found a way to address the issue effectively, and that Boehner himself lied when saying Obama lied.\n\nFor the record, attorney general nominee Loretta Lynch defended Obama\u2019s immigration actions and called them \u201ca reasonable way to marshal limited resources to deal with the problem\u201d of illegal immigration. And Nancy Pelosi has pointed out that, \u201cThe President\u2019s actions fall well within the clear constitutional and legal authority of his office, and the well-established precedent set by every president since Eisenhower.\u201d\n\n4. Healthcare.gov \u201cis working flawlessly\u201d (12/15/14). The Facts: The ObamaCare train wreck continues to pile up as families struggle with higher costs, fewer options, and a website plagued with problems. The administration now admits it sent 800,000 Americans erroneous tax forms through Healthcare.gov, POLITICO reports the website is \u201ca mess\u201d and \u201cstill isn\u2019t properly wired,\u201d and last month the Associated Press learned Healthcare.gov \u201cis quietly sending consumers\u2019 personal data to private companies that specialize in advertising.\u201d\n\nActual Facts: First of all, as far back as March of 2014 Politifact ruled that the claim that healthcare.gov is working great now is \u201ca fair assessment.\u201d But then Boehner loves himself some fake healthcare.gov horror stories and he was like a kid being forced to eat his vegetables after signing up for his own excellent coverage. This is a man determined not to be happy.\n\nAnd the information shared is not personal information and AP goes on to say that \u201coutside firms are barred from using the data to further their own business interests.\u201d For the record, there is nothing surprising about data being shared when you visit a website. Boehner is pretending this is a unique occurrence.\n\nMeanwhile, Uninsured rates continue to plummet as people continue to sign up for Obamacare, and the president has reminded Republicans that Obamacare is surpassing all projections, a fact Boehner carefully ignores in his own list of pretend facts. The mainstream media (and Boehner) won\u2019t talk about any of this so they focus on technical issues.\n\nThe fact is Gallup showed Obamacare left people happy with their healthcare costs, 64 percent of people want to keep Obamacare subsidies and even Red Staters are jumping at the chance to sign up.\n\nAnd finally \u2013 and embarrassingly \u2013 neither Boehner nor McConnell have the slightest idea to give the American people in place of Obamacare, except \u201cjust die already.\u201d\n\n5. \u201cI have no more campaigns to run\u201d (1/20/15). The Facts: For the Obama administration it\u2019s all politics all the time. That\u2019s why he\u2019s pushing \u201cmiddle-class economics\u201d that don\u2019t actually help the middle class, that\u2019s why he didn\u2019t dare buck the radical left-wing environmentalists who oppose Keystone XL, and that\u2019s why he went down to Miami this week to \u201cblame\u201d \u201cattack\u201d and \u201cratchet up pressure\u201d on Republicans while doing absolutely nothing to help break Senate Democrats\u2019 filibuster on a bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nActual Facts: Hilariously, Boehner can\u2019t get over his lost oil profits, and no doubt, fear that the Kochs will be disappointed in their bought man\u2019s efforts. In fact, Boehner is the one pretending to be pro-middle class. And blaming the Democrats for withholding funding for Homeland Security is just a shade less brazen than his lie that the Keystone bill is a jobs bill.\n\nBoehner not only ignores the EPA\u2019s ruling on the environmental hazards of the Keystone XL pipeline, essentially calling science \u201cradical\u201d and \u201cleft-wing,\u201d but he ignores the impact on Native Americans, and they oppose the pipeline, which must cross their sacred lands. Aren\u2019t we finally at the point where we can stop breaking treaties?\n\nThe Rosebud Sioux Tribe went so far as to call the House vote an \u201cact of war.\u201d Apparently treaty obligations mean no more to Boehner than his obligations as the Speaker of the House to do more than stuff his own pockets with corporate money.\n\nJohn Boehner needs to be reminded he works for us, not the Koch Brothers, even if they pay better, and that actually focusing on the issues for once, rather than concocting lies, would be a more fruitful use of his time.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Unwilling to do anything to help Americans, John Boehner concocts some more self-serving lies to blame Obama for his own failings", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Hrafnkell Haraldsson", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "Unwilling to do anything to help Americans, John Boehner concocts some more self-serving lies to blame Obama for his own failings", "title": "5 Big Whoppers from Speaker Boehner", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2015/02/28/5-big-whoppers-speaker-boehner.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/boehner-angry-obama.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-02-28T07:59:45+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Featured News,U.S. House of Representatives,america,Barack Obama,department of homeland security,Environmental Protection Agency,fake healthcare.gov horror stories,Gregg Abbot,healthcare.gov,ISIL,John Boehner,Keystone pipeline,Keystone XL Pipeline,Loretta Lynch,mainstream media,Nancy Pelosi,Obama Administration,right wing terrorism,TransCanada Corp,United States,United States House of Representatives,White House,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "U.S. House of Representatives", "published_time": "2015-02-28T07:59:45+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-28T07:59:45+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "america, Barack Obama, department of homeland security, Environmental Protection Agency, fake healthcare.gov horror stories, Gregg Abbot, healthcare.gov, ISIL, John Boehner, Keystone pipeline, Keystone XL Pipeline, Loretta Lynch, mainstream media, Nancy Pelosi, Obama Administration, right wing terrorism, TransCanada Corp, United States, United States House of Representatives, White House"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5e43\"", "article_summary": "In fact, Boehner is the one pretending to be pro-middle class.\nThe Facts: President Obama desperately wants to justify his unilateral actions on immigration.\nHere, to throw his own words back in Boehner\u2019s face, are five of this winter\u2019s biggest whoppers from Speaker Boehner:1.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen some record cold this winter in DC, but over at the White House there\u2019s been no lack of hot air,\u201d says John Boehner in his latest House update, which he ironically titles 5 Big Whoppers From President Obama.\nThe Facts: This outrageous claim came just days after President Obama vetoed a bipartisan bill to approve the broadly popular Keystone XL pipeline."}
