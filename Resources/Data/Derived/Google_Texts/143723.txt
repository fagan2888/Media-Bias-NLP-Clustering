In his introduction to Repast: Dining Out at the Dawn of the New American Century, 1900-1910, author Michael Lesy quotes the 19th-century French epicure and philosopher Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin: “Tell me what you eat, and I will tell you what you are.” Leslie and co-author Lisa Stoffer take that statement a step further, gaining all sorts of social and cultural insight into the first decade of the American century, a time when the number of restaurants in the U.S. increased by 78 percent. Their examination of where and what people of the time were eating not only tells us a lot about them but also a lot about us.

Lesy’s inspiration and original window into that world was a collection of menus held at the New York Public Library. It was assembled in the late 1800s and early 1900s by Miss Frank Buttolph, as she signed her name. When Lesy came upon the collection online, he was fascinated by both its visual appeal and what it said about America. “The stuff is so astonishingly beautiful,” he said. “You think of the quality and the printing and the beauty of the illustrations, and you’re just taken. Looking at the collection online, you can see the menus year by year.” Lesy suggests clicking on the menu covers to see what lies within them. “You get the bill of fare, which can be quite astonishing. Looking through these brings the times to life. It’s strange and wonderful and crazy.” The collection can be viewed at the New York Public Library’s Digital Gallery website.
