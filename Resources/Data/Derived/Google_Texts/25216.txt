Kier Partnership Homes has begun work on a Â£100m housing estate project in Derby that will see 700 homes builot over the next seven years.

The Manor Kingsway development, which also includes a business park as well as houses, is being built on land formerly occupied by Manor and Kingsway hospitals.

The scheme is being delivered by a partnership made up of developer Kier Partnership Homes, Derby City Council, the Homes & Communities Agency (HCA) and Nottingham Community Housing Association.

Kier was appointed by the city council and HCA two years ago to deliver the project. Since then it has been working with Derbyshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, Derby Hospital NHS Trust and East Midlands Ambulance Service to develop for the properties, which range from one to five bedrooms, with a number of affordable homes available to rent or buy.

Energy-saving features design in include solar panels, triple glazing, thermal mass flooring, low-energy lighting, high-efficiency boilers, smart metering, LED external lighting and low-level street lighting.

Kier Partnership Homes managing director Chris King said: "We were delighted to be selected by the partnership of the HCA and Derby City Council to realise its vision for the former hospital site. We have worked closely with them and with the Design Council OPUN to develop a concept that offers spacious, economically efficient and stylish new homes, which are well connected to their surroundings and offer a great environment in which to live."
