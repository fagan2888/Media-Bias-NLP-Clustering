Hobby Lobby\u2019s health care plan covers male condoms and various other forms of contraception \u2014 and its case to the Supreme Court had to do with other kinds of measures to prevent pregnancy \u2014 but the religious leaders said the protest was ultimately about exposing the multiplicity of religious beliefs around contraception.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just hoping that (people who see the demonstration) realize that this opinion (of Hobby Lobby\u2019s owners) is not the opinion of religious people as a broad spectrum, but that religious people have many different opinions,\u201d Rev. Emmy Lou Belcher, a UUA minister who was at the protest, told the Daily Herald.\n\nReligious leaders also said they hoped the move would draw attention to the danger of allowing employers to privilege their own religious beliefs over those of their employees.\n\n\u201cYou can make the religious freedom argument, you can make the argument about contraception, but ultimately, for me, this is about power,\u201d said Rev. Mark Winters, a UCC minister. \u201cJesus had a lot of issue with powerful people using power over the powerless.\u201d\n\nThe action in Aurora is part of a growing number of religious Americans who are publicly expressing their frustration with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision. Several faith leaders have spoken out against Hobby Lobby\u2019s position even before the decision was announced, and Serene Jones, President of Union Theological Seminary in New York City, was quick to blast the ruling, saying, \u201cI am horrified by the thought that the owners of Hobby Lobby as Christians think their corporation has a soul, and I\u2019m even more appalled that the Supreme Court agrees.\u201d\n\nJust hours after the court issued its ruling on Monday, a baptist minister held a prayer vigil outside Hobby Lobby\u2019s flagship store in Edmond, Oklahoma, to decry the decision. According to a statement released by Faithful America, a progressive Christian group that helped organize the vigil, the crowd of religious faithful gathered to pray for \u201cHobby Lobby employees who will now have difficulty accessing health care they need to responsibly plan for their families\u2019 futures.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are many of us Baptists, as well as other Christians, who believe that religious liberty rights are something inviolable for individuals and not for corporations,\u201d Dr. Bruce Powell, the leader of the protest, told News Channel 4 in Oklahoma City. \u201cThe right of religious liberty is a fundamental human right. Corporations are legal constructs. They are not human beings.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "\"You can make the religious freedom argument, you can make the argument about contraception, but ultimately, for me, this is about power,\" Rev.
