The wonderful cheesy goodness that is pizza appeals to most Americans without regard to political persuasion. But corporate interests behind the savory treat have spent millions trying to keep consumers in the dark about what they\u2019re eating when they grab a slice and rolling back regulations that make our children healthier.\n\nPizza companies are actively involved in politics, spending $1.5 million during the 2012 and 2014 elections, according to Andrew Martin of Bloomberg Business. And while the monetary amount doesn\u2019t approach that of the Koch brothers, the direction in which it flows does\u201488% of the money went to Republican candidates and support groups. Mitt Romney got $110,807 of pizza industry contributions in his 2012 race. And who can forget former Godfather\u2019s Pizza CEO Herman Cain, who was briefly the frontrunner for the GOP nomination in that cycle?\n\nThe biggest pizza campaign donor is Pizza Hut. Of the $685,369 the company contributed, 98.9% went to Republicans. Papa John\u2019s was 86.8% Republican.\n\nThe pizza industry has two main political goals. The first is to fight off attempts to force calorie and nutrition information to be accessible to consumers. Dominos, Papa John\u2019s and other chains claim there are too many combinations of ingredients to make calorie counts feasible. Also, they claim most pizza is ordered over the phone or online, so most consumers don\u2019t see signs posted in restaurants anyway.\n\nPizza companies did win the right to list nutrition information by the slice, rather than an entire pie\u2019s worth. Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Washington) says the labeling requirements are \u201csuffocating America\u2019s economy,\u201d according to Politico, and has introduced a bill that would roll back some of the regulations.\n\nBig Pizza\u2019s second goal is to roll back school lunch nutrition requirements that make the food less likely to be served in cafeterias. Rules that mandate maximum amounts of sodium and fat and require whole grains are anathema to frozen pizza makers such as Schwan\u2019s that supply school food programs. That campaign is getting some traction now that Congress is controlled by Republicans eager to hand First Lady Michelle Obama a setback in her fight to improve the eating habits of American children.\n\nAt least one pizza mogul came out strongly against the Affordable Care Act (ACA). John Schnatter of Papa John\u2019s claimed he\u2019d lose about 15 cents per pizza if his company had to offer employees insurance under the ACA.\n\nSo when you\u2019re ordering a large with pepperoni, keep in mind that some of your money is going to fund the right\u2019s quest to enrich corporate America at the expense of the health of Americans. And don\u2019t forget to tip your driver.\n\n-Steve Straehley\n\nTo Learn More:\n\nInside the Powerful Lobby Fighting for Your Right to Eat Pizza (by Andrew Martin, Bloomberg Business)\n\n2015, the Year the GOP Strikes Back at Obama Food Policies (by Jenny Hopkinson, Helena Bottemiller Evich, Bill Tomson and Chase Purdy, Politico)\n\nPizza Cartel Fights Calorie Count Disclosure (by Noel Brinkerhoff, AllGov)\n\nUSDA Upgrades School Breakfast and Lunch Programs, but Pizza Still a Vegetable (by Noel Brinkerhoff and David Wallechinsky, AllGov)", "article_metadata": {"description": "The pizza industry has two main political goals.
