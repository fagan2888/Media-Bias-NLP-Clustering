However, the agency is now moving to include the \u201cnarrative\u201d portion of complaints \u2013 that is, customers\u2019 explanations of what happened and why.\n\n\u201cOur members are concerned about it, principally because of the concern about potential consumer confusion. It\u2019s one side of the story,\u201d said Anne Wallace, senior director consumer financial services at the Roundtable.\n\nCFPB has said that when it begins releasing the consumer narratives, it will give institutions an opportunity to respond to the complaints. However, said Wallace, constraints on what a financial services firm can disclose about a particular customer will limit the ability to address complaints.\n\n\u201cIt really doesn\u2019t help,\u201d said Wallace. \u201cAll your transactions with your financial institutions are confidential. A financial institution would be hard-pressed to say anything other than \u2018Thank you for your comment.\u2019\u201d\n\nRelated: Taxpayers Eat $120 Million Over Budget for CFPB\n\nIf someone complained about a late fee, for instance, a credit card company would not be allowed to explain that the fee was levied because the consumer was 60 days behind on payments.\n\nWallace also said the industry is also worried about the government giving anonymous complainants added credibility.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve all used social media sites, places where people rate hotels and airlines,\u201d she said. \u201cYou read that with a certain grain of salt. But if you read something on a government website, you think it\u2019s going to be true. It [would seem to have] greater credibility than a private social media site.\u201d\n\nThe CFPB says that the plan to release narratives is part of its \u201cefforts to put the voice of the consumer more directly and centrally into the everyday processes of financial institutions.\u201d The agency has put the proposal out for public comment.\n\nThe comment period was supposed to expire on August 22 \u2013 but due to a large response, it\u2019s been extended to September 22.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The financial services industry was none too happy when the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau announced that it would create an online database in which consumers could post stories about negative interactions with financial services firms.
