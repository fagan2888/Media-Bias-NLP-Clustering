If there was another way that humans could identify perpetrators of crimes \u2014 relying on a deeply intuitive sense that is strongly linked to memory \u2014 it could possibly be a game changer in forensics.\n\nIn a new study published in the journal PLOS ONE, researchers examined how the sense of smell could aid victims in better identifying criminals of violent crime. Previously, using smell in forensics had been completely overlooked. But the fact is, no one smells exactly alike; our body odors are comprised of specific things like age, diet, hormonal status, and even what parasites are in our bodies. On top of that, our noses are quite smart \u2014 especially when it comes to triggering memories.\n\n\u201cEvery individual has a unique body odor (BO), similar to a fingerprint,\u201d the researchers wrote in their abstract. \u201cIn forensic research, identification of culprit BOs has been performed by trained dogs, but not by humans. We introduce the concept of nosewitness identification and present the first experimental results on BO memory in witness situations involving violent crimes.\u201d\n\nThey found that smelling criminals\u2019 odors helped people identify them 75 percent of the time, which is a significant increase from the 45 to 60 percent that people correctly identify criminals via the traditional eyewitness lineup.\n\n\u201cOur results suggest that humans are capable of identifying a culprit by way of odor,\u201d the researchers added. \u201cWhen the perpetrator and the victim are close to one another, as in crimes of sexual and physical assault, and especially under visually obscure conditions, an olfactory cue may be the prevailing detail.\u201d\n\nThe researchers took body odor samples from the armpits of 20 healthy participants for the study. They then showed videos of violent crimes to 40 students, providing each with a specific odor sample. Afterward, the students were asked to sniff five different smelly glass jars, then told to identify which stench was associated with the criminal.\n\nThe authors aren\u2019t entirely certain what made the participants associate the criminal strongly with smell, although they hypothesize that it might have to do with negative emotions during the encoding of the body odors. In a second experiment in the study, they found that associating odors with negative experiences actually enhanced participants\u2019 ability to identify the odor again later, compared with people who had neutral experiences. This might have something to do with the fact that the sense of smell has been shown in previous research to be a strong trigger for memories \u2014 more so than any other sense. Taking a smell of a long-lost teen chapstick, for example, can take you back to a specific moment in your past \u2014 like sitting in your parents\u2019 car as a 15-year-old on the way to summer school.\n\n\u201cOdors and faces are inherently different types of stimuli in several ways, and memory for odors may thus be differently influenced by emotion than memory for faces,\u201d the authors concluded. \u201cAlthough the relation between emotion and olfaction has gained considerable interest, the current study is the first, to our knowledge, indicating that negative emotion during encoding can enhance actual recognition. However, there is much to do in order to complete the picture, such as direct comparative studies of odor an visual stimuli.\u201d\n\nWhile this experiment wasn\u2019t done in the real world, 75 percent accuracy is still pretty significant \u2014 and the researchers believe they need to explore it further.\n\nSource: Alho L, Soares S, Ferreira J, Rocha M, Silva C, Olsson M.
