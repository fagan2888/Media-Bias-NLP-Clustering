David Vitter\u2019s 2007 prostitution scandal. Maybe his vicious attacks against his Republican opponents backfired and split the Louisiana GOP. Perhaps Vitter finally ran up against a potent, well-funded Democratic opponent at exactly the wrong time.\n\nThe pundits will offer these and other plausible theories about how Louisiana Democratic Gov.-elect John Bel Edwards defied enormous odds in Saturday\u2019s election and vanquished Vitter, a Republican and the once-prohibitive favorite.\n\nEach theory is probably valid and a piece of the crazy puzzle that resulted in Edwards\u2019 improbable victory. My analysis, however, is simple. It\u2019s about how Vitter and his aides incorrectly analyzed the race more than a year ago.\n\nI believe that Vitter lost to Edwards for the same reason the United States lost the Vietnam War to Ho Chi Minh\u2019s Viet Cong. Like the hapless U.S. generals and their Pentagon bosses in the 1960s, Vitter made several fatal miscalculations: First, he underestimated and misunderstood his opponent. And he fought with once-successful, but now-outdated, strategies from previous campaigns. (Full disclosure: Last spring, I would not have disputed Vitter\u2019s strategy. In fact, I wrote that it would probably work.)\n\nIn his book On War, the Prussian general and military theorist Carl von Clausewitz observed that the \u201cfirst, the supreme, the most far-reaching act of judgment that the statesman and commander have to make is to establish . . . the kind of war on which they are embarking; neither mistaking it for, nor trying to turn it into, something that is alien to its true nature. This is the first of all strategic questions and the most comprehensive.\u201d\n\nMost Vietnam War historians agree that the U.S. military ignored Clausewitz\u2019s wisdom. We badly misjudged the Vietcong, underestimated its strength and tenacity and misinterpreted the very nature of the war we were fighting. The U.S. confronted a well-armed insurgency with a conventional strategy of conquering and holding territory. Put simply, our generals employed World War II and Korean War-style tactics to fight an insurgency in South Vietnam that was not about territory but hearts and minds.\n\nWe lost because we did not know what kind of war we were fighting.\n\nClausewitz\u2019s advice on war applies to politics, as well. Vitter did not know what kind of campaign he was running. In fighting his Democratic opponent, he made the same mistakes as the U.S. generals in Vietnam 50 years ago. He did not adapt to new circumstances. Simply put, Vitter fought \u201cthe last war.\u201d\n\nBased on earlier, successful campaigns, Vitter assumed he would easily win so long as he faced a Democrat in Saturday\u2019s runoff (Louisiana has an open election system in which Democrats and Republicans are on the same ballot in a non-partisan primary). As he hoped, Vitter got Edwards as his runoff opponent, after he savagely attacked and eliminated his two Republican opponents.\n\nVitter\u2019s experience told him that from there, victory was a simple matter of raising as much money as possible and using it to run spots attacking Edwards as an Obama clone. As he had done in the past, Vitter planned to make the election a simple referendum on Obama. Based upon his easy victory in 2010, Vitter also likely assumed that his prostitution scandal was no longer an issue.\n\nIf that\u2019s what Vitter thought about this governor\u2019s race (and all the available evidence suggests that he did), he badly miscalculated.\n\nHard as he tried this election, he never made the race about Obama. Instead, to his dismay, the campaign became a referendum on Vitter \u2013 his judgment, ethics and character. The prostitution scandal that Vitter assumed was resolved became, instead, a central theme of the race.\n\nAt every turn, Vitter\u2019s assumptions about the race proved incorrect. Relying on experience \u2013 fighting the only way he knew \u2013 Vitter waged the wrong war, using the wrong strategy and the wrong tactics.\n\nIn his 2010 re-election against then-Democratic U.S. Rep. Charlie Melancon, Vitter masterfully turned the race into a referendum on President Obama, negating any damage from his prostitution scandal. In that race, Vitter ran several effective TV spots that turned Melancon into an Obama proxy.\n\nThat year, Vitter also aired an ugly, racist TV spot that attacked Melancon and vilified illegal aliens (he showed swarthy Mexican-looking men climbing through a fence and running toward a waiting limousine).\n\nVitter\u2019s scorched-earth style worked. He won with 56.6 percent of the vote.\n\nLast year, in a race managed by Vitter\u2019s communications director, then-Republican U.S. Rep. Bill Cassidy handily defeated Sen. Mary Landrieu using the same playbook. Cassidy didn\u2019t even need complete sentences to tie Landrieu to Obama. He said, simply, \u201cLandrieu. Obama. 97 percent.\u201d (In other words, Landrieu voted with Obama 97 percent of the time.) The attacks were effective and deadly. After three terms in the Senate, the more liberal Landrieu was a plausible proxy for Obama in the eyes of Louisiana voters. She never stood a chance against Cassidy.", "article_metadata": {"description": "First Bobby Jindal, now Vitter. Two Louisiana conservatives suffer career defeats.
