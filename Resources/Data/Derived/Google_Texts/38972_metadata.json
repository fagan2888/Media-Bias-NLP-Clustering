Pics Tara Croser.\n\nEMPLOYMENT and Industrial Relations Minister Curtis Pitt has heard of a text message breakup, but said he was shocked to hear of the dismissal of 41 wharfies via SMS last week.\n\nSpeaking to a gathering of unionists at the Port of Brisbane this afternoon, Mr Pitt said he was unimpressed by the \u201ccowardly\u201d move by Hutchison Ports.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing fair about the text message dismissal of people, it\u2019s a cowardly act,\u201d Mr Pitt said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard of all sorts of things in my time, I\u2019ve heard of people having breakups via text message.\n\n\u201cBut waking up...expecting to show up to work the next day and having that thrust in front of you...it\u2019s not the way things are done if you\u2019re doing it in fairness.\u201d\n\nMr Pitt told the crowd he could only be there to support the crowd as it was \u201ca federal matter not a state matter\u201d, but offered assistance from the Palaszczuk Government to those affected by the redundancies.\n\nHe also criticised the Abbott Government\u2019s lack of support of the sacked workers.\n\n\u201cWhat we have seen is a very big contrast between the support from the Palaszczuk Government and the non-support by the Abbott Government,\u201d Mr Pitt said.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019ve got the federal Employment Minister Eric Abetz saying that it\u2019s OK to sack workers via text message, clearly there is something wrong.\u201d\n\nMr Pitt said Hutchison\u2019s act would not go unnoticed by the State Government, but he would not comment on what financial assistance the Government would provide to the 41 affected families.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve done is shown our support by coming down here...\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf they need any of that widespread assistance then the Government will give consideration to those things.\u201d\n\nEarlier, union picketers blocking access to a berth at the Port of Brisbane claimed power to the site has been cut in a bid to move them off.\n\nAt least 29 unions have been picketing the Hutchison Ports Australia site since the company sacked 97 workers in Brisbane and Sydney via text message and email four days ago.\n\nMaritime Union of Australia Queensland state secretary Bob Carnegie says the company has now cut power to a substation near their site to try to break the picket.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the sort of animals we\u2019re dealing with,\u201d he told picketers today.\n\n\u201cWhat, do they think we\u2019re not resourceful enough to get over that obstacle?\u201d\n\nBrisbane workers went to meet with a Hutchison HR representative at the Shangri-La hotel in the city.\n\nHannah Matthewson, 24, was sacked on Friday night along with her sister and father and said the group confronted the reps at the hotel, demanding they be seen as a group and not one-on-one as planned.\n\n\u201cWe all marched up to the door chanting \u2018MUA here to stay\u2019,\u201d Ms Matthewson said.\n\n\u201cOur delegates went in and told them they would only speak to the company as a collective.\u201d\n\nIt is understood the company\u2019s human relations representative Peter Hudson and a colleague had to be escorted by security through the chanting crowd.\n\nThe meeting was dissolved.\n\nMs Matthewson said she was devastated to lose her job and would probably have to put her home up for sale to make ends meet.\n\n\u201cWe want to negotiate and go through the criteria properly. They didn\u2019t follow a criteria when they sacked us,\u201d she said.\n\nHutchison Ports says the job cuts are necessary because it is downsizing after incurring substantial financial losses.\n\nA hearing into the matter is scheduled to be heard at the Fair Work Commission in Sydney this afternoon.\n\nBut the 200 Brisbane picketers have dug in for the long haul at the port, setting up tents, couches and generators to support themselves.\n\nA bagpiper has also been playing tunes like Waltzing Matilda around the site, while some passing truck drivers have blown their horns in solidarity.\n\nIt\u2019s unlikely the protest will disrupt the wider facility, a port representative said.\n\nEARLIER\n\nHUNDREDS of union members have gathered at the Port of Brisbane to protest the sacking of more than 40 workers by text message.\n\nIt is understood Hutchison Ports informed 41 permanent staff by text message to check their emails on Friday evening.\n\nThe email outlines their contracts had been terminated.\n\nProtest organiser Paul Petersen told The Courier-Mail it had been a distressing weekend for those involved.\n\n\u201cThey went and read their email and it said they weren\u2019t welcome to come back and pick up their personal belongings,\u201d Mr Petersen said.\n\nAccording to Mr Petersen the company informed workers their personal items would be packaged and sent to their home addresses in due course.\n\nOne of the text message advising workers of their sacking.\n\nIt is understood the email detailed that a meeting would take place this morning where individual staff would have the opportunity to speak with supervisors.\n\nPresident of Queensland Council of Unions John Battams said Hutchison Ports have \u201ca lot to answer for\u201d.\n\n\u201cWorkers after years of service being dismissed via text message and email is just not good enough,\u201d Mr Battams said.\n\nIt is understood police have no plans to break up the gathering.\n\n\u201cThe company knows very well it has done the wrong thing and the consequence of that we hope is that people can get back to work as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nMr Battams said until the matter is resolved the picket line will continue.\n\n\u201cWe are here to see justice being done and it will remain peaceful at all times,\u201d\n\nBob Carnegie of the Maritime Union Australia said the gathering was fighting for every Australian working class person.\n\n\u201cOver the last few days the only thing I\u2019ve heard is nothing...the silence has been deafening,\u201d Mr Carnegie said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in compulsory meetings in the Fair Work Commission at 5pm tonight in Sydney so we\u2019ll see what becomes of that.\u201d\n\nAccording to Mr Carnegie the feeling among the sacked workers has been \u201c100 per cent solid\u201d.\n\n\u201cTheir fellow workers who kept their job are 100 per cent behind them so there is total unity,\u201d he said.\n\nThe workers served as stevedores, losing and unloading cargo ships.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re very proud of their jobs and skills and to see the way they have been treated makes me sick to my stomach.\u201d\n\nHutchison Ports says it\u2019s incurring substantial financial losses and is downsizing, but the MUA believes it\u2019s trying to increase automation at its ports and is using excuses to lay off staff.\n\nA hearing has been scheduled at the Fair Work Commission in Sydney later today.\n\nThe sacked workers will gather this morning at Wynnum\u2019s Shangri-La Gardens hotel to collectively front Hutchison bosses to plead their case.\n\nMeanwhile workers from Toowoomba, the Sunshine Coast and Gold Coast have travelled to support the workers at the Port of Brisbane.", "article_metadata": {"description":
