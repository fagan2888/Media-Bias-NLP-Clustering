He said the nation\u2019s unemployment rate has dropped to 5 percent and that, over the past 69 months, 13.7 million new jobs have been created.\n\nObama also said, \u201cAll of this progress is because of you, because of workers rolling up their sleeves and getting the job done, and entrepreneurs starting new businesses, because of teachers and health workers and parents -- all of us taking care of each other.\u201d\n\nIn contrast, the Republican Senate majority leader in his weekly address listed the biggest legislative accomplishments of the year as including the approval of a federal highway bill to spend billions on transportation projects, the OK of a measure that would enable more veterans to have access to health care, the passage of anti-human trafficking legislation and the end to a decades-old oil export ban.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nMcConnell also thanked members of the electorate who voted last year for the new majority in the Senate, which he described at the time as chaotic. \u201cWhen you voted for this new majority last November, the Senate was a mess,\u201d he said. \u201cWe believed the Senate could be restored to a place of high purpose again, and we\u2019ve made great strides over the past year proving that it can.\u201d\n\nObama counts down his top 10 steps forward of 2015; WATCH: https://t.co/7PXJaDG6dU pic.twitter.com/GcUwaYrQIj \u2014 The Hill (@thehill) December 19, 2015\n\nOne thing both Obama and McConnell agreed on was the bipartisan education law that replaces the controversial No Child Left Behind Act.
