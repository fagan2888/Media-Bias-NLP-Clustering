The ACLU has stepped in on behalf of the two children and their respective parents.\n\nIn the complaint , made publicly available, the plaintiffs allege that Sumner, working as a School Resource Officer at both of the schools where the two children attended, violated their constitutional rights under provisions of the American With Disabilities Act by handcuffing them unnecessarily.\n\nBoth incidents occurred in the Fall of 2014, when Sumner was summoned to the area by school personnel. In the case of the boy, named S.R. in the lawsuit, Sumner handcuffed him after he refused to comply with one of his directions to sit down. The third-grader had been diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) as well as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which all present adults were aware of beforehand. At the time, S.R. was experiencing \u201cdisability-related difficulties\u201d in listening to school personnel and so was sent to the Vice Principal\u2019s office to wait for his mother to arrive.\n\nIt was at that point that Sumner decided to handcuff S.R. behind his back, the handcuffs needing to be placed above his elbows because he was simply too small to wear them normally. \u201cYou can do what we want you to do or you can suffer the consequences,\u201d Sumner appears to tell the boy in the video as he places the handcuffs on, right before S.R. shouts out, \u201cOw, that hurts!\u201d\n\nAs ghastly as that may seem, it may pale in comparison to Sumner\u2019s treatment of the nine-year-old girl, coined L.G. in the lawsuit. The fourth grader, also diagnosed with ADHD, had been first sent to the back of Sumner\u2019s police cruiser after she began acting out in August 2014; then later that October, after another incident, she was similarly handcuffed for twenty minutes, which traumatized her to the point that she needed to be taken to the hospital in an ambulance for psychiatric treatment.\n\nBy the time she saw Sumner again three weeks later \u2014 while behaving perfectly fine \u2014 his very presence caused her to run away in fear, which led to her being restrained one final time.\n\n\u201cPlaintiff L.G. remained kneeling on the floor, handcuffed and struggling, for about thirty minutes until her mother L.J. arrived,\u201d read the complaint.\n\nThey accuse Sumner of having used physical restraints illegally because at no point was he or anyone else in danger of immediate physical harm from the two children. According to reports filed by Sumner that the lawsuit cites, Sumner excused his use of handcuffs in each incident by claiming the children had tried to assault him.\n\nThe ACLU has named the Kenton Country Sheriff\u2019s Office and its reigning Sheriff, Chuck Korzenborn, in the lawsuit as well, for having failed to properly train and supervise Sumner.\n\n\u201cThe lawsuit seeks an order requiring a change in policies by the Kenton County Sheriff's Office, and additional training for school resource officers in dealing with young children and children with special needs,\u201d read the ACLU\u2019s statement on the lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky. \u201cIt also seeks an unspecified amount of monetary damages against Sumner.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "sheriffs, deputy, faces, lawsuit, video, shows, him, handcuffing, 8, year, old, boy, ptsd", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A Kentucky Sheriff's deputy is accused of illegally handcuffing not one, but two children with special needs after they began to misbehave.", "title": "8-Year-Old Boy With Special Needs Gets Handcuffed For Refusing To Sit Down [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/sheriffs-deputy-faces-lawsuit-video-shows-him-handcuffing-8-year-old-boy-ptsd-346176", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/08/04/sheriffs-deputy-faces-lawsuit-video-shows-him-handcuffing-8-year-old-boy-ptsd.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A Kentucky Sheriff's deputy is accused of illegally handcuffing not one, but two children with special needs after they began to misbehave.", "title": "8-Year-Old Boy With Special Needs Gets Handcuffed For Refusing To Sit Down [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/sheriffs-deputy-faces-lawsuit-video-shows-him-handcuffing-8-year-old-boy-ptsd-346176", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/08/04/sheriffs-deputy-faces-lawsuit-video-shows-him-handcuffing-8-year-old-boy-ptsd.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/08/04/sheriffs-deputy-faces-lawsuit-video-shows-him-handcuffing-8-year-old-boy-ptsd.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-08-04T22:59:51-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-04T23:09:39-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A Kentucky Sheriff's deputy is accused of illegally handcuffing not one, but two children with special needs after they began to misbehave."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda349\"", "article_summary": "in the lawsuit, Sumner handcuffed him after he refused to comply with one of his directions to sit down.\nThe ACLU has named the Kenton Country Sheriff\u2019s Office and its reigning Sheriff, Chuck Korzenborn, in the lawsuit as well, for having failed to properly train and supervise Sumner.\nBoth incidents occurred in the Fall of 2014, when Sumner was summoned to the area by school personnel.\nIn the case of the boy, named S.R.\nAccording to reports filed by Sumner that the lawsuit cites, Sumner excused his use of handcuffs in each incident by claiming the children had tried to assault him."}
