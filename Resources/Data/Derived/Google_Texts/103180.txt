Update: Patel has been released from jail on a $2,000 bail, but his facility remains closed.

It’s an arrest that took far too long. After Operation Rescue filed a complaint against him with the Oklahoma Health Department for crimes hard to stomach, police have raided abortionist Nareshkumar Gandalal “Naresh” Patel’s office and sent him to prison.

The list of charges against him seems endless. A USA Today headline from last year read, “Okla. doctor says he dumped fetuses,” recounting how Patel dumped 60 fetuses in a field near Shawnee, Okla., and tried to burn them.

If that wasn’t enough to put him behind bars, the handful of rape and sodomy charges against him certainly was.

In 1993, Patel was charged with one count of “forcible oral sodomy” and one count of sexual battery after a patient alleged that he had sexually assaulted her on an examination table prior to an abortion. She then recorded two phone conversations with him in which she alleged that he asked if she was angry about the assault and apologized for it. Three victims came forward and told of their encounters with Patel.

These victims’ testimonies are extremely graphic, but you can read about their disturbing encounters with Patel here.

In addition to treating babies like discarded waste and reportedly treating women like tools, Patel is also charged with “obtaining money by false pretenses” and faces a slew of malpractice claims.

It’s cases like this that prove Philadelphia abortionist Kermit Gosnell is not an anomaly. Gosnell, for those who don’t recall, was convicted of murdering three babies born alive after failed abortions, as well as involuntary manslaughter of one of his patients. Patel’s crimes might not seem so egregious as Gosnell’s, but they’ve both proven they’re a danger to society.

Gosnell is now where he belongs and his filthy clinic was closed for good. Hopefully Patel and his abortion center face the same fate.
