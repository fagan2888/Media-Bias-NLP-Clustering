And now in Colorado, you can vote anywhere on Election Day that your heart happens to take you.\n\nHow do we know this? Well, because I\u2019m not going to jail. Well \u2026 at least I\u2019m not going to jail for voting where my heart brought me.\n\nAnti-gun legislation might have been the big story during the last Colorado legislative session, but the most dangerous bill passed was a revamp of our already weak voting laws.\n\nColorado is the poster child for sloppy elections. Not only is a cable TV or water bill a valid form of voter identification here, but we\u2019re the only state in the country that has both all mail-in ballots and same-day voter registration.\n\nUnder the new law, our ballots are flung through the mail like grocery-store coupons, whether you want them delivered to you that way or not. As the news site CompleteColorado.com reported, ballots in the last election were readily found in trash cans and apartment mail rooms, just ready to be harvested.\n\nBut even more disturbing, this new law legalizes moving voters around like chess pieces on Election Day to the district where their vote is most needed. Now a voter who merely \u201cintends\u201d to make a different district his home can vote in that district.\n\nAnd get this: Any enforcement of \u201cvoter fraud,\u201d even if it could be caught, happens after the ballots are all counted and recorded. Under this same-day voter registration law, the vagabond voter is handed a ballot when and where he registers. His ballot goes into the ballot box and there\u2019s no yanking it back out.\n\nSo, the winner of future elections in Colorado will be the campaign that has the most buses. The team best at playing this shell-game controls government.\n\nTo prove that very point, I \u201cmoved\u201d from Boulder to Colorado Springs and cast a ballot in the John Morse recall election last September. I then \u201cmoved\u201d back to Boulder shortly afterward. Legal complaints were immediately filed against me for voter fraud.\n\nI took a couple extra easy precautions, even though the law doesn\u2019t require it. I signed a simple lease, pulled free off the Internet, for a room in a friend\u2019s house where I spent the night. And I went online to change my address at the DMV. That\u2019s it. No fuss, no muss, no expense.\n\nCiting the \u201cambiguities\u201d in the new law, the Colorado attorney general\u2019s office earler this month announced that, after a three-month investigation, a criminal prosecution against me is \u201cnot warranted or viable.\u201d This announcement is a surprise to no one because they can\u2019t prosecute you for following the law.\n\nAll of this proves a simple point: It is now legal to move voters around during elections to where their vote is most leveraged.\n\nAs the new session starts, I hope the legislature and Gov. John Hickenlooper will repeal the obscene same-day registration law. If they don\u2019t, we all have the responsibility to learn about our new voter rights and exercise them fully.\n\nToward that end, the Independence Institute will accelerate our BringInTheVote.com educational campaign to teach all Coloradans how to legally \u201cbring in\u201d their vote to the district of their choice.\n\nNone of us wrote these unmanageable voting rules, but they are now the rules of elections in Colorado. They are your new voting rights, so you had better use them. Others certainly will.\n\nJon Caldara is president of the Independence Institute, a think tank in Denver.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Caldara: New voting rights in Colorado", "title": "Caldara: New voting rights in Colorado", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/01/10/caldara-new-voting-rights-in-colorado/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140110__voting-coloradop1.jpg", "height": 452}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140110__voting-coloradop1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-10T15:19:02+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T01:06:58+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbbaa\"", "article_summary": "None of us wrote these unmanageable voting rules, but they are now the rules of elections in Colorado.\nUnder this same-day voter registration law, the vagabond voter is handed a ballot when and where he registers.\nAnd now in Colorado, you can vote anywhere on Election Day that your heart happens to take you.\nSo, the winner of future elections in Colorado will be the campaign that has the most buses.\nAnti-gun legislation might have been the big story during the last Colorado legislative session, but the most dangerous bill passed was a revamp of our already weak voting laws."}
