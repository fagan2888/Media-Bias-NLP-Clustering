New Analysis Shows ISIS Losing Ground\n\nThe stereotype of Iraqi forces as the Keystone Cops was lifted, at least for the time being, when they raised the country\u2019s flag atop the government compound in the center of the city, with the U.S. Defense Department rushing to offer praise.\n\n\"We congratulate the Iraqi Security Forces for their continued success against ISIL in Ramadi,\u201d Col. Steve Warren, a spokesman for the U.S-led military coalition, said in a statement. \"The clearance of the government center is a significant accomplishment and is the result of many months of hard work by the Iraqi Army, the Counter Terrorism Service, the Iraqi Air Force, local and federal police, and tribal fighters.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month Defense Secretary Ash Carter said Iraqi progress in retaking the city had been \"disappointingly slow\u201d and offered Baghdad the use of Apache attack helicopters to speed things up, an offer the government ultimately declined\n\nStill, the picture In Ramadi steadily improved over the last two weeks, as Baghdad\u2019s forces, backed by American fighter jets and bombers, fought their way to the heart of the city.\n\nRelated: Running Out of Patience, Obama Rebuffs Attacks on His ISIS Strategy\n\nThe timing of the win comes on the heels of a study by IHS Jane\u2019s Conflict Monitor team that estimated ISIS has lost hundreds of miles of territory inside Iraq and Syria. But while military officials in Washington and Baghdad may be celebrating for the moment, it\u2019s unclear whether the victory will prove too little, too late to change the public\u2019s mind about Obama\u2019s anti-ISIS effort.\n\nDespite an aggressive public relations campaign by the president, a new CNN/ORC poll found that 40 percent of American believe terrorists have the upper hand in the war on terror and a whopping 74 percent are dissatisfied with U.S. progress against ISIS, which has dominated the news cycle ever since its agents carried out the carnage in Paris last month.\n\nSuccess in Ramadi could very well be overlooked by a public fatigued from more than 12 years of conflict in Iraq and have heard similar progress reports in the past, only to see them wiped out, rekindling the debate about deploying a massive amount of U.S. ground troops into Iraq and Syria.\n\nRelated: America\u2019s Top General Says We\u2019re Not Ready to Defeat ISIS\n\nRepublicans running for president have routinely bashed Obama\u2019s strategy for destroying ISIS, though few have offered concrete details about what they would do differently. They are likely to be pressed on whether the win in Ramadi means the president has had the right strategy all along.\n\nThe president also should not assume the good news is going to be spread around the water cooler since much of the country\u2019s focus has been on the security situation in Syria.\n\nRussia\u2019s involvement in that country, the resulting migrant crisis that sparked a major fight on Capitol Hill and the ongoing civil war have kept the international community rapt, especially as the U.S. works to kick start a new peace process.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Iraqi troops retaking the city of Ramadi gives the White House a much-needed, highly-visible victory in its war against ISIS and undercuts the pervasive narrative that President Obama doesn\u2019t have the right strategy to defeat the terror group.", "title": "How Retaking Ramadi Is a Big Win for Obama\u2019s Anti-ISIS Strategy", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/28/How-Retaking-Ramadi-Big-Win-Obama-s-Anti-ISIS-Strategy", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/07252014_ISIS.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/28/How-Retaking-Ramadi-Big-Win-Obama-s-Anti-ISIS-Strategy", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/07252014_ISIS.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Iraqi troops retaking the city of Ramadi gives the White House a much-needed, highly-visible victory in its war against ISIS and undercuts the pervasive narrative that President Obama doesn\u2019t have the right strategy to defeat the terror group.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca601\"", "article_summary": "Related: Is Obama\u2019s Strategy Working?\nThey are likely to be pressed on whether the win in Ramadi means the president has had the right strategy all along.\nRelated: America\u2019s Top General Says We\u2019re Not Ready to Defeat ISISRepublicans running for president have routinely bashed Obama\u2019s strategy for destroying ISIS, though few have offered concrete details about what they would do differently.\nIraqi troops retaking the city of Ramadi gives the White House a much-needed, highly-visible victory in its war against ISIS and undercuts the pervasive narrative that President Obama doesn\u2019t have the right strategy to defeat the terror group.\n\"We congratulate the Iraqi Security Forces for their continued success against ISIL in Ramadi,\u201d Col.
