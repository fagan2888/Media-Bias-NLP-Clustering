Bookers at \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d \u201cMorning Joe\u201d and \u201cThis Week\u201d are being called out for treating these liars and frauds, who led the charge for the disastrous Iraq War, as experts whose opinions on the latest violence in Iraq is somehow in high demand.\n\nSalon was curious about the most prominent of these placements, when Paul Wolfowitz, the former deputy secretary of defense, was asked onto last Sunday\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d We asked several NBC News P.R. representatives and producers for comment and received none. Perhaps we\u2019re just silly and the rationale behind the bookings is obvious. They\u2019re just trying to get one side of the story!\n\nBut do these guys really represent a legitimate \u201cside\u201d in the current Iraq debate, or just themselves and a few other discredited friends within the Beltway?\n\nLet\u2019s posit, for a minute, that it\u2019s not the end of the world for two more frauds to be treated as experts on television. There\u2019s nothing new about this; approximately 892 percent of political television is active fraudulence against its viewers. And what if we were to forget their previous indiscretions and start from a blank slate? \u201cNow is not the time to re-litigate either the decision to invade Iraq in 2003 or the decision to withdraw from it in 2011,\u201d Fred Kagan and Bill Kristol write in the Weekly Standard. That\u2019s an amazing thing to ask, but let\u2019s take them up on it. Let\u2019s just look at what Kristol, Kagan and Wolfowitz are calling for with regards to the situation in Iraq right now, and determine whether it\u2019s a reasonable argument that could represent one significant \u201cside\u201d in the debate and thus merit the megaphone of repeated television exposure.\n\nSo \u2026 what\u2019s the argument? Kristol and Kagan, how about you go first?\n\nThis would require a willingness to send American forces back to Iraq. It would mean not merely conducting U.S. air strikes, but also accompanying those strikes with special operators, and perhaps regular U.S. military units, on the ground. This is the only chance we have to persuade Iraq\u2019s Sunni Arabs that they have an alternative to joining up with al Qaeda or being at the mercy of government-backed and Iranian-backed death squads, and that we have not thrown in with the Iranians. It is also the only way to regain influence with the Iraqi government and to stabilize the Iraqi Security Forces on terms that would allow us to demand the demobilization of Shi\u2019a militias and to move to limit Iranian influence and to create bargaining chips with Iran to insist on the withdrawal of their forces if and when the situation stabilizes.\n\nWhen Kristol went on \u201cMorning Joe\u201d Tuesday to defend this hot thesis, fellow guest John Heilemann asked one of the several obvious follow-ups: \u201cHow would you get over the fact that the country en masse, Democrat and Republican, would tell you you\u2019re nuts to think that we should be sending residual forces back into Iraq to get back involved in this war?\u201d Kristol replied that he believed a presidential speech could rally the public to the side of reinvasion. Who knew that Bill Kristol held the president\u2019s rhetorical powers in such high esteem?", "article_metadata": {"description": "TV bookers should not only ignore these fools because they were wrong, but because they are fringe characters now", "title": "Extremist neocon dunces: They weren\u2019t just wrong \u2014 they have no following anymore!", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "TV bookers should not only ignore these fools because they were wrong, but because they are fringe characters now", "title": "Extremist neocon dunces: They weren\u2019t just wrong \u2014 they have no following anymore!", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/18/extremist_neocon_dunces_they_werent_just_wrong_they_have_no_following_anymore/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/kristol_wolfowitz_cheney.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "TV bookers should not only ignore these fools because they were wrong, but because they are fringe characters now", "title": "Extremist neocon dunces: They weren\u2019t just wrong \u2014 they have no following anymore!", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/kristol_wolfowitz_cheney.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jim Newell", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Bill Kristol, Editor's Picks, Foreign policy, Fred Kagan, Iraq, Iraq war, John Heilemann, Media Criticism, meet the press, Morning Joe, neocons, neoconservatives, Paul Wolfowitz, Sunday shows", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Who knew that Bill Kristol held the president\u2019s rhetorical powers in such high esteem?\nSalon was curious about the most prominent of these placements, when Paul Wolfowitz, the former deputy secretary of defense, was asked onto last Sunday\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d We asked several NBC News P.R.\nThere\u2019s nothing new about this; approximately 892 percent of political television is active fraudulence against its viewers.\nLet\u2019s posit, for a minute, that it\u2019s not the end of the world for two more frauds to be treated as experts on television.\nKristol and Kagan, how about you go first?"}
