Inflation holds steady and job creation is sufficient to keep unemployment where it is. The growth band, Li added, should prove sustainable through 2020.\n\nRelated: Is the US Facing a \u2018Fighter Gap\u2019 With China and Russia?\n\nOnward, comrades, with President Xi Jinping\u2019s ambitious market-reform program. That\u2019s Li\u2019s core position. \u201cProblems and risks that have been building up over the years are becoming more evident,\u201d the premier said in his lengthy speech. \u201cBut there is no difficulty we cannot get beyond.\u201d\n\nI have no trouble with either of these observations. I have plenty with prevalent responses in news reports, on opinion pages, and from the securities firms. These lie somewhere between (1) Beijing\u2019s flinching, (2) the Chinese still don\u2019t grasp the gravity of their problems, and (3) Li\u2019s cheerleading with out-of-touch forecasts that are far too sunny.\n\nThe problem is the markets can\u2019t read China very well. They overreact in consequence, and then they over-commit to defending the overreaction. The media, largely, simply reflect this\u2014which is only part of what they\u2019re supposed to do.\n\n\u201cIt continues to strike me how some of these people who should know better are very far from up to speed on the world's second-largest, fastest-growing major economy,\u201d Kenneth S. Courtis, chairman of Starfort Holdings wrote the other day. \u201cThis is la cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of the global economic and financial elite, and we still hear stuff that even Donald Trump would be embarrassed to say.\u201d\n\nRelated: Emerging Markets Sink Into Post-Boom Soul Searching\n\nThat remark arrived just as the Group of 20 meeting in Shanghai wrapped up the week prior to Li\u2019s speech. Since the context is pertinent to the China question, let\u2019s add the G-20 gathering to the picture.\n\nAs everyone now seems to agree, we\u2019re watching a global slowdown that\u2019s either durable and secular\u2014as Martin Wolf just argued in the Financial Times\u2014or we\u2019re at risk of tipping into another cyclical recession. Not brilliant either way, of course.\n\n\u201cBehind this is a simple reality,\u201d Wolf writes. \u201cThe global savings glut\u2014the tendency for desired savings to rise more than desired investment\u2014is growing and so the \u2018chronic demand deficiency syndrome\u2019 is worsening.\u201d Wolf quotes that last phrase from the OECD\u2019s latest forecasts.\n\nCompanies aren\u2019t investing because people aren\u2019t buying. I would add this: People aren\u2019t buying because prevalent economic policies\u2014not to mention ideologies\u2014leave too many people around the world too uncertain, too broke, too indebted, or all three to do so.\n\nRelated: Emerging Markets Lead Stocks Higher As Commodities Rise\n\nHere\u2019s the real and present problem: The two phases of central bank-centered policy\u2014lower interest rates and monetary easing\u2014are maxed out. The alternative is fiscal stimulus, which begets two corollary problems.\n\nOne, the emerging market economies can\u2019t afford much stimulus. Li Keqiang just said so as he unwrapped China\u2019s 2016 economic strategy. Two, fiscal stimulus strategies are unavailable to the nations that can afford them because to propose one is politically off-limits for the moment.\n\nWolf, citing Ray Dalio, founder of the hedge fund Bridgewater, suggests a third phase of monetary strategy: \u201c\u2018Monetary policy 3\u2019 directly targeted at encouraging spending.\u201d Milton Friedman used to call these \u201chelicopter drops,\u201d Wolf reminds us\u2014direct infusions of cash where they\u2019ll be most effective.\n\nThis is fiscal stimulus with a new name for the sake of ideological cover. I can see time-consuming political warfare in any such policy\u2014who is funded and why?\u2014and time becomes of the essence in the current global environment.\n\nAmong the developing economies, there are glimmers of good news. Antoine van Agtmael, who gave us the term \u201cemerging markets\u201d in the 1980s, now argues that they\u2019re re-emerging, having found the bottom at last. Not coincidentally, there are also signs that commodity markets are bouncing off the floor. Inventories are down and big consumers\u2014i.e., the Chinese\u2014are coming back into some markets.\n\nThere\u2019s a big \u201cbut\u201d here, and it\u2019s this:\n\nRelated: Funds Call Emerging Market Currency Turn Again\n\nIn The Smartest Places on Earth, van Agtmael asserts that developing nations aren\u2019t going to prove the global growth drivers they were long expected to be. The key lies in reading the acceleration of technological change.\n\nOne, labor inputs will prove less decisive as a comparative advantage. Two, and counter-intuitively, the new growth leaders will be what we used to call the Rust Belt economies, where cultures of innovation take root in all those splendid old grease-and-oil factories once given up for dead.\n\nIn the meantime, the policy planners in the advanced nations really do need a reboot\u2014George Osborne, Britain\u2019s Chancellor of the Exchequer, being Exhibit A. Osborne will present his new budget to parliament March 16, and as you may have noticed, Britons are outraged already.\n\n\n\nOsborne is sticking to his target of a budget surplus by the 2019-20 fiscal year, and seems committed to doing everything necessary to reach it.\n\nEnough already with the austerity theme\u2014in Britain and elsewhere. It\u2019s hopelessly old hat and prevents us from doing what the global economy plainly needs doing. Now\u2019s the time to\u2014Guess what\u2014borrow and spend.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "China\u2019s new", "title": "Here\u2019s Why China\u2019s Not the Global Economy\u2019s Problem", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2016/03/07/Here-s-Why-China-s-Not-Global-Economy-s-Problem", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/china-markets-yuan_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2016/03/07/Here-s-Why-China-s-Not-Global-Economy-s-Problem", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/china-markets-yuan_1.jpg", "creator": "@psmith7600", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "China\u2019s new", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Related: Emerging Markets Lead Stocks Higher As Commodities RiseHere\u2019s the real and present problem: The two phases of central bank-centered policy\u2014lower interest rates and monetary easing\u2014are maxed out.\nTwo, fiscal stimulus strategies are unavailable to the nations that can afford them because to propose one is politically off-limits for the moment.\nAntoine van Agtmael, who gave us the term \u201cemerging markets\u201d in the 1980s, now argues that they\u2019re re-emerging, having found the bottom at last.\nThis is fiscal stimulus with a new name for the sake of ideological cover.\nThe alternative is fiscal stimulus, which begets two corollary problems."}
