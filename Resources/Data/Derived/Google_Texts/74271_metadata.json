Other groups involved in the coalition include the Silicon Valley Leadership Group and the Semiconductor Industry Association.\n\nChristopher Padilla, Vice President of Governmental Programs at IBM, told the Daily Caller that he thought that it was remarkable that the tech community, which he acknowledged \u201ccan sometimes be a fractious industry,\u201d is \u201c100 percent behind this issue.\u201d\n\nPadilla said that it was important to give green cards to immigrants who come to the U.S. to earn degrees in science and technology.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather see that happen than have us train people who then go work for our foreign competitors in China or Europe or elsewhere,\u201d said Padilla.\n\nDouglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum, told the Daily Caller that the tech industry has been \u201ca pretty consistent voice on the policy need for better immigration strategy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have any sort of political interest in the Hispanic vote or all of these other issues that get bandied about,\u201d said Holtz-Eakin. \u201cThey\u2019re worried about the nuts and bolts of a competitive economy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re very mobile in their markets, they\u2019re quite cognizant of our inability to compete, and they want to fix it,\u201d he said.\n\nThe technology industry\u2019s support for immigration reform has been met with skepticism, particularly because some critics perceive the industry as attempting to hire cheap imported labor instead of Americans.\n\nHoltz-Eakin, however, called that argument \u201cconceptually misplaced,\u201d stating that global competition has already placed pressure on wages.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s also true if you look at the studies, you just don\u2019t find the support for that kind of an argument,\u201d he said, arguing that immigration either has no impact on domestic wages or it improves domestic wages.\n\nThe battle addressing the nation\u2019s immigration woes isn\u2019t expected to take center-stage for the House until the end of October and into early November. By then, the coalition will be entering a new phase of a process that has taken up a large part of the year.\n\nThe coalition won\u2019t, however, be alone; their counterparts at Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s FWD.us, as well as the companies represented by TechVoice, TECNA, and CompTIA have also been hard at work during the recess to bring about a positive conclusion to the debate for the pro-immigration reform crowd.\n\nOpposition to pro-immigration reform forces, according to a recent report by the Atlantic, also seems to have fizzled in the August heat.\n\nImmigration reform is also a priority for top Obama advisor Valerie Jarrett, who recently signaled that an immigration bill would be an achievement on par for the administration as Obamacare.\n\nFollow Josh on Twitter and Facebook", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Josh Peterson", "description": "This is a message resonating within the technology sector for some time.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "As Congress prepares for budget battles and a vote over military intervention in Syria, a coalition of technology associations has been working to sell immigration reform, arguing it will boost the U.", "title": "Tech companies leapt into the immigration reform fray", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2013/09/01/tech-companies-leapt-into-the-immigration-reform-fray/", "image": {"width": 628, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/immigration-rally-Saul-Loeb-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg", "height": 270}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "'They're worried about the nuts and bolts of a competitive economy'", "creator": "@@jdpeterson", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2013/09/01/tech-companies-leapt-into-the-immigration-reform-fray/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/immigration-rally-Saul-Loeb-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg"}, "title": "Tech companies leapt into the immigration reform fray Via @dailycaller", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-09-01 03:36:12", "sailthru.title": "Tech companies leapt into the immigration reform fray", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "keywords": "immigration reform,mark zuckerberg", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "sailthru.tags": "josh-peterson", "sailthru.description": "As Congress prepares for budget battles and a vote over military intervention in Syria, a coalition of technology associations has been working to sell immigration reform, arguing it will boost the U.", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/immigration-rally-Saul-Loeb-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf4d1\"", "article_summary": "Immigration reform is also a priority for top Obama advisor Valerie Jarrett, who recently signaled that an immigration bill would be an achievement on par for the administration as Obamacare.\nThe coalition includes groups like TechNet, Information Technology Industry Council, Computer Electronics Association and the Internet Association.\nThe Technology CEO Council, an advocacy organization representing major U.S. technology companies, launched a campaign mid-August to promote immigration reform to encourage the recruitment and retainment of high-skilled labor \u2014 a message that the technology sector has broadcasted for some time.\n3839216As Congress prepares for budget battles and a vote over military intervention in Syria, a coalition of technology associations has been working to sell immigration reform, arguing it will boost the U.S. economy.\nThe technology industry\u2019s support for immigration reform has been met with skepticism, particularly because some critics perceive the industry as attempting to hire cheap imported labor instead of Americans."}
