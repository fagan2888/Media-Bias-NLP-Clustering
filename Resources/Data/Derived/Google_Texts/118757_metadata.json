Relief is on the way.\n\nAfter years of complaints from teachers, parents and students alike, the Obama administration on Saturday announced new guidelines toward standardized tests, saying kids spend too much time taking \u201cunnecessary\u201d exams in schools.\n\nIn a Facebook video message, President Barack Obama said he hears from parents who worry about \u201ctoo much testing, and from teachers who feel so much pressure to teach to a test that it takes the joy out of teaching and learning.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to fix that,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Department of Education said \u201cthe Administration bears some of the responsibility for\u201d the issue, releasing a \u201cTesting Action Plan\u201d outlining new principles for measuring student aptitude. The plan says current policies have led to \u201cunnecessary testing\u201d with \u201cnot enough clarity of purpose.\u201d\n\nThe guidelines are recommendations for school districts to follow but are not binding regulations.\n\nThe administration isn\u2019t citing specific tests that should be continued or scrapped, leaving that decision up to the particular districts as testing differs from state to state. The guidelines don\u2019t replace those that are part of No Child Left Behind, but if Congress were to alter that law and include the Obama administration\u2019s recommendations, districts would then be required to follow them.\n\nAdditional details will be released in January, according to the White House.\n\nThe administration gives general ways to assess each of those qualities.\n\nObama said the new guidelines call for taking only the \u201ctests that are worth taking\u201d\u2013 that are \u201chigh quality, aimed at good instruction\u201d and that ensure students are \u201con track.\u201d\n\nThe plan recommends that students spend no more than 2% of classroom time taking these tests, and that parents be notified if their child\u2019s school exceeds this limit.\n\nTesting shouldn\u2019t \u201ccrowd out teaching and learning\u201d and should just be one of many tools to measure how students and schools are performing, Obama said.\n\nTwo major teachers unions lauded the announcement.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s common sense,\u201d said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers. \u201cThe fixation on high-stakes testing hasn\u2019t moved the needle on student achievement.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big deal that the president and the secretaries of education-both current and future-are saying that they get it and are pledging to address the fixation on testing in tangible ways,\u201d Weingarten said.\n\nBut, she added, \u201cthe devil is in the details.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the National Education Association tweeted an endorsement to Obama\u2019s plan, writing on its official Twitter account, \u201cParents, students, educators: the administration has heard your voices! Students need #timetolearn!\u201d\n\nOn Monday, Obama will meet with teachers and representatives of states and school districts to discuss the issue. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan and his deputy, John King, are expected to attend.", "article_metadata": {"geo.position": "38.907192;-77.036871", "description": "https://www.facebook.com/WhiteHouse/videos/10153858451374238/ WASHINGTON -- Stressed-out students nationwide, take note.
