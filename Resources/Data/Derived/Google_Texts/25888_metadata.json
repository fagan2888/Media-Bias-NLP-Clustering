But one big topic went completely without mention: student loan debt.\n\nOver the course of two hours, just one candidate \u2014 Florida Sen. Marco Rubio \u2014 mentioned student loans. Rubio, who only paid off his own loans four years ago, referenced his past $100,000 debt to make the point that Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton wouldn't be able to \u201clecture\u201d him about living paycheck to paycheck.\n\nOtherwise, the nearly $1.2 trillion and growing, student debt load millions of Americans carry went unmentioned.\n\nSee also: How Democrats want to make college more affordable\n\nFor Republicans looking to boost their appeal to young voters and middle-class Americans, that could be a problem: Student debt is no longer simply a \u201cyoung voters\u201d issue that politicians can afford to give short shrift. The total debt has become so large and so spread across age groups that experts say it\u2019s stifling economic growth and making income inequality worse nationwide.\n\nThe data shows how the problem has grown. A decade ago, more than 42% of all student debt ($346 billion total at the time) was held by people under the age of 30, according to research from the New York Federal Reserve.\n\nBut by 2014, less than third of the total debt (now $1.15 trillion overall) was held by borrowers younger than 30. The largest share (33%) was held by those between the ages of 30 and 39. And almost a fifth was held by people in their 40s.\n\nThe soaring debt looks even more staggering when you chart it across age groups.\n\nIn 2004, borrowers under 30 had $146 billion in student loans, compared to $114 billion for those in their 30s and $49 billion for those in their 40s. By 2014, though, the totals had more than doubled for the two youngest age groups, and increased four-fold for those in their 40s, a sign of how just long the debt can linger for many borrowers.\n\nIf the last few days are any indication, it seems the lack of attention paid to student loans a week ago won\u2019t last. Clinton, for her part, rolled out a student debt relief plan on Monday, and even enlisted emojis later in the week to help make her case. As The New York Times put it Friday, the plan \u201chas put pressure on her opponents as she has made a centerpiece of her agenda an issue that resonates across classes, party lines and generations.\u201d\n\nOther Democrats have also addressed the issue head on. Former Maryland governor and Baltimore mayor Martin O\u2019Malley\u2019s plan calls for reducing costs, refinancing loans and tying payments to income. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, for his part, has called for making higher education free entirely.\n\nBut it\u2019s still unclear how Republicans will respond. Bush blasted Clinton\u2019s plan almost as soon as it was released. He called it \u201cfiscally irresponsible\u201d and said, \u201cWe don\u2019t need more top-down Washington solutions that will raise the cost of college even further and shift the burden to hardworking taxpayers.\u201d He went on to say the U.S. needs \u201cpro-growth economic policies that will give more college graduates the opportunity to achieve earned success,\u201d but so far hasn't released a detailed plan of his own, let alone one addressing costs.\n\nRubio, meanwhile, called the plan \u201cObamacare for College\u201d and went on Fox News to criticize it. For the most part, his plan involves greater \u201ctransparency\u201d around student loans, helping people be aware of the costs of college before attending. But he\u2019s also added little about tackling cost.\n\nHeather Jarvis, a student loan expert, said the lack of detailed proposals isn\u2019t likely to continue for long, for a very simple reason: \u201cStudent loans affect many, many Americans, and it\u2019s because tuitions have risen so sharply,\u201d she said. \u201cOnly the very rich can afford to pay for college with cash.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the candidates are going to start talking about it a lot more,\" she added.\n\nHave something to add to this story?
