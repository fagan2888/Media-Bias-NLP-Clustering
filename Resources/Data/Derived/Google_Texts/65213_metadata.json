Police say to the surprise of the clerk working at Days Inn that evening, a man walked into the lobby area, and pulled out his weapon.\n\n\"The clerk stated that a black male walked inside the business and displayed a handgun,\" Det. Dareall Thompson says.\n\nPolice say the man demanded money, leaned over the counter and grabbed it, then ran away on foot, east down Highway 11-80. He was gone when police arrived.\n\n\"The male subject fled the scene with cash. The clerk stated that the black male was wearing a white bandanna and covering his face,\" Det. Thompson says.\n\nThey're not certain right now exactly how much cash the man got away with. Det. Thompson says the clerk was shaken, but she wasn't hurt during the encounter. Now, the search is on for the masked man, and investigators are considering the fact that multiple people could be involved in this crime.\n\n\"At this time, it's still an ongoing investigation,\" Det. Thompson says. \"We don't want to rule anything out as far as whether it was one or two people involved.\"\n\nInvestigators are hoping someone can come forward with more details about the masked robber.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Meridian police are investigating an armed robbery at the Days Inn Saturday night.", "language": "english", "author": "Candace Barnette", "og": {"description": "Meridian police are investigating an armed robbery at the Days Inn Saturday night.", "title": "Masked Man Robs Meridian Hotel at Gunpoint", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Masked-Man-Robs-Meridian-Hotel-at-Gunpoint-296383051.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/4BA/ABE/4BAABEB7934A4C83A816F51C84839745", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/419/3D8/4193D8A158FF482883A84ACBC6D2CF74.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.wtok.com", "description": "Meridian police are investigating an armed robbery at the Days Inn Saturday night.", "title": "Masked Man Robs Meridian Hotel at Gunpoint", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Masked-Man-Robs-Meridian-Hotel-at-Gunpoint-296383051.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/robbery.mgn.jpeg", "creator": "@newscenter11", "site": "@newscenter11", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Masked Man Robs Meridian Hotel at Gunpoint", "google-site-verification": "M1YwZ85zoJ2ZNboZjzjADGJ9L53qqzbNOi6FLrtDw9U", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Masked Man Robs Meridian Hotel"}, "article_summary": "Now, the search is on for the masked man, and investigators are considering the fact that multiple people could be involved in this crime.\n\"The clerk stated that a black male walked inside the business and displayed a handgun,\" Det.\nPolice say to the surprise of the clerk working at Days Inn that evening, a man walked into the lobby area, and pulled out his weapon.\nPolice say the man demanded money, leaned over the counter and grabbed it, then ran away on foot, east down Highway 11-80.\nThe clerk stated that the black male was wearing a white bandanna and covering his face,\" Det."}
