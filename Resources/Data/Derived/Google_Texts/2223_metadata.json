It passed the state\u2019s House of Representatives on Monday for the first time ever on a bipartisan vote. If the Senate gives it a thumb\u2019s up before the session ends on Saturday at noon, it could mean a big change for dentistry.\n\nAt Cochiti Pueblo\u2019s dental clinic Dr. Patricio Larragoite congratulated his young patient on the lack of buildup on his teeth. \"What we\u2019re doing is a teeth cleaning for this young man, part of our prevention program,\" he said. \"I see a baby tooth that\u2019s loose right there. You can come and look at this also, mom.\"\n\nThe patient sat under a bright light in the well-equipped, sunny building. Larragoite wiggled a couple of the kid\u2019s molars, and promised they\u2019ll be out by his birthday in a couple of weeks. The patient promised they\u2019ll be out by that night. \"I shouldn\u2019t have told you anything,\" Larragoite laughed. \"You going to put it under your pillow? Does the tooth fairy go to your house? I get half.\"\n\nLarragoite has been a licensed dentist in New Mexico for 38 years. For much of that time he ran a private office in Santa Fe. Folks would come to him from miles away, he said, because he was one of the few dentists in the area who accepted Medicaid. \"You\u2019d see, you know, the little, you know, pickup truck pull into the parking lot. The whole family\u2019s there\u2014grandma, grandpa, kids, mostly a lot of kids\u2014and what they\u2019re doing, they\u2019re maximizing their trip. Because typically they have to travel 60 miles or more one way.\"\n\nHe saw a need, he said, and that\u2019s why he started working in federally qualified health clinics throughout rural New Mexico. A lot of times, a person\u2019s first access to the health care system in New Mexico is a dental encounter, he said. \"The mouth is a window to your health, so a lot of things show up first in your mouth. For example, now with the measles epidemics, we do know that there\u2019s small white vesicles that show up in your mouth before you actually have 104 fever and before the red measles show up on your skin.\"\n\nLarragoite will see 18 patients on this day. That\u2019s his average. And if he had a dental therapist to help him out, he estimated the clinic could see five times as many people.\n\nBut dental therapists don\u2019t exist\u2014yet.\n\nPamela Blackwell of Health Action New Mexico has been pushing for the Legislature to create a mid-level dental provider for five years. So what could a dental therapist do? Routine procedures, like basic fillings, denture repair, and teeth extractions when no incision is required. \"This would really help with our underserved areas, which are rural, tribal, and right here in Albuquerque,\" she said. \"You could live next to a dentist, but that does not mean that you\u2019ll get access to dental care.\"\n\nLess than half of licensed dentists in the state treat Medicaid patients, Blackwell said, and the Affordable Care Act added thousands to the roster of people who can get dental care covered by Medicaid. \"In order to make good on the insurance they now have, they need somewhere to go,\" she said.\n\nOf New Mexico\u2019s 33 counties, 32 are federally designated dentistry shortage areas. Dental therapists would come from the communities dealing with health care shortages, and the idea is that after three or four years of school, they could return home and get to work.\n\nBut not everyone is thrilled at the prospect of a new mid-level dental care provider. In fact, the New Mexico Dental Association objects to the bill. Tom Schripsema is the organization's governmental affairs chair. \"I do think there\u2019s a possibility that some communities that probably would like to have a dentist,\" he said, \"if they get a dental therapist who\u2019s only got a very limited scope of things that they\u2019re doing, dentists are going to be less likely to locate in those locations later on.\"\n\nPeople in rural areas are typically only an hour to an hour-and-a-half away from dental care, he added, and they\u2019re used to traveling into bigger towns to have some of their needs met. \"There\u2019s a limited number of financial resources, and we feel like they need to be applied to the solutions that are going to be most effective in solving the problem.\"\n\nSchripsema said the dental association would rather see dentists paid fairly under Medicaid. He adds that if funding is diverted from dentistry programs to dental therapy programs\u2014or if overreaching changes are made to dentistry regulations\u2014the association will be forced to push back.\n\n***\n\nPublic Health New Mexico intern Arianna Sena also contributed to this report.
