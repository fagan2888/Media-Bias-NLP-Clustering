Canada's annual inflation rate fell to 1.3 percent in March from the previous month's 1.4 percent. Analysts had expected inflation to be 1.2 percent last month. On a year-over-year basis, the gasoline component was down 13.6 percent. Excluding gasoline, the inflation rate was 1.9 percent. Overall, prices were up in six of the consumer price index's eight major components, with food and shelter leading the way higher. Food prices rose 3.6 percent as consumers paid more for fresh fruit, vegetables and meat than they did a year ago. Core inflation, which strips out some volatile items and is closely watched by the Bank of Canada, was 2.1 percent, up from 1.9 percent in February. The central bank has an inflation target of 1 percent to 3 percent, but it has said it is looking through some of the temporary factors that are currently impacting the rate.
