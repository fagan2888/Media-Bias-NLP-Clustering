Bernie Sanders of Vermont is not going to be president.\n\nPennsylvania\u2019s Hillary Clinton supporters made sure of that last Tuesday when they delivered the Keystone State to the former secretary of state and first lady by a spread of 56 percent to 44 percent \u2014 the difference of about 200,000 votes and enough to put the election nearly out of reach for Sanders.\n\nIn Philadelphia, the margin was broader \u2013 63 percent to 37 percent, with Sanders finding victory in the city\u2019s mostly White, river wards.\n\nThe Black vote, as usual, fell easily to Clinton \u2014 Clinton, who had played dominoes with senior citizens in East Harlem, informed Charlamagne Tha God on New York\u2019s Hot 105.1 radio show that she carried hot sauce in her bag, and on whose shoulders Black religious leaders at Philly\u2019s historic Mother Bethel A.M.E Church laid hands upon \u2013 just as a group of Black bishops in a widely circulated photo did to candidate Barack Obama eight years earlier.\n\nBut before we Bernie believers depart the spotlight (Sanders vows to continue onward until the convention, but the public focus is always the horse race. And we\u2019re not in it), we want to set a few things straight. We still want our issues addressed.\n\nIf we, as a nation, recognize that a college education is required in order to make a decent living in America, then college education in America needs to come without a lifetime of debt. We want free college tuition.\n\nThe coziness between big-money donors \u2014 from the fracking industry to big banks and hedge fund firms \u2014 and political candidates who later set policy affecting those industries, must stop. Or it should at least be monitored and brought to light.\n\nUniversal health care needs to be free. For many people, it isn\u2019t even \u201caffordable\u201d as was the intention of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, which Republicans dubbed Obamacare. More workable options need to be examined in providing health care to the masses.\n\nAnd we as individuals want a voice in the political process. We don\u2019t want \u201cthe establishment\u201d or the pampered \u201cpolitical class\u201d telling us what we\u2019re supposed to do and when we\u2019re supposed to do it.\n\nAnd yes, that\u2019s a dig at Clinton. When asked during a town hall meeting in Philadelphia that was moderated by MSNBC\u2019s Rachel Maddow if she might incorporate any of Sander\u2019s ideas into her platform, Clinton responded: \u201cI have a bigger lead in pledged delegates than Senator [Barack] Obama, when I ran against him in 2008, ever had over me. I am winning. And I\u2019m winning because of what I stand for and what I\u2019ve done and what my ideas are.\u201d\n\nWell, excuse us. (And we\u2019ll excuse all the \u201cI,I,I\u201d\u2019s).\n\nClinton\u2019s attitude could fail to motivate the unmotivated voter. And it doesn\u2019t sound like the attitude of someone who promises to \u201cknock down barriers.\u201d It sounds like a wall.\n\nIn response to calls for Sanders and his supporters to quietly go away, Clinton pointed to her loss to Obama eight years ago: \u201cI nominated him at the convention in Denver. I spent an enormous amount of time convincing my supporters to support him \u2026 I hope we see the same thing this year.\u201d\n\nSomehow, I don\u2019t recall her enthusiasm at the time. And I can still hear her supporters\u2019 shrieks of \u201cHillary!\u201d until that strained final moment at the convention.\n\nTo Bernie supporters, be proud. You created something out of what many in power and influence insisted was nothing. You did more with $27 than many donors do with $27,000. And the smartly painted \u201cBlack Men for Bernie\u201d caravan from Dallas that wound through Philly\u2019s streets on Election Day was marvelous.\n\nWe may not have sparked a revolution, but we put up quite a fight.\n\nAnd to Clinton\u2019s loyal Black supporters, don\u2019t let your loyalty be taken for granted. \u201cStay woke\u201d as the saying goes, on issues of appointments, legislation and priorities.\n\nElections matter. But they\u2019re not the end of anything.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "https://ionenewpittsburghcourier.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/sanders460x.jpg?w=150", "sailthru.author": "Sheila Simmons", "description": "So the revolution isn\u2019t going to happen.
