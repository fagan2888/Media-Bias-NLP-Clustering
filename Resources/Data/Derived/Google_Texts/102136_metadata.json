Sebelius has very few 'I think it was not only well worth it, but a battle worth fighting.'\n\nDuring the worst days of the Obamacare rollout last year, Kathleen Sebelius kept her spirits up by thinking about \u2026 Medicare.\n\nAs the Obamacare website was crashing and conservative interest groups were shining the spotlight on canceled health plans, the embattled Health and Human Services secretary flashed back to the fierce battles over the creation of Medicare in the 1960s, when the American Medical Association fought its passage and called it \u201csocialized medicine.\u201d Now, she says, when the AMA speaks out about Medicare, it\u2019s when the doctors are trying to prevent their Medicare payments from being cut.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe lesson for future political leaders who might be thinking about the next ambitious social programs? Don\u2019t shy away from them because of what happened with Obamacare, says Sebelius, who resigned at the end of the first enrollment season. Political battles don\u2019t last \u2014 and no matter how loud the critics of Obamacare are now, their perspective will change, even if it takes years.\n\n\u201cI say go for it,\u201d Sebelius, now a speaker and consultant, said in an interview with POLITICO. \u201cI think change is very, very hard, and there is always a default position of, either do nothing or do something very small and get in and out of the battle as quickly as possible.\u201d\n\n( More from POLITICO's Lessons from Leaders)\n\n\u201cI think it was not only well worth it, but a battle worth fighting,\u201d Sebelius said. \u201cMillions and millions of people are the beneficiaries of this policy.\u201d\n\nThe Affordable Care Act could easily be a chilling lesson for future political leaders: Don\u2019t be too ambitious in creating a new social program, keep it incremental and safe, because government can\u2019t handle anything this complicated. But Sebelius says there\u2019s no reason for up-and-coming lawmakers and policymakers to lower their sights, with plenty of other difficult social challenges to take on \u2014 especially long-term care, a big policy headache in itself that the health care law wasn\u2019t able to solve.\n\nYes, she knows how bad the rollout was, and she wishes it had gone smoothly from day one. Looking back on it, she would have had better coordination between the tech teams and the policy people, and she hopes the federal government finally updates its rules so it can get better contractors. But she still insists that she and other top administration officials didn\u2019t get any clear warnings from the contractors that the website wasn\u2019t ready \u2014 the kind that might have given them a reason to delay it.\n\nAnd even though the website disaster is what everyone remembers, Sebelius says there was a whole series of other rapid-fire implementation actions that did go well \u2014 everything from putting early consumer protection provisions in place, including the popular coverage of young adults, to changes in payment incentives and the delivery of medical care.\n\n\u201cThere were pieces of this puzzle being put in place along the way that were not insignificant in either money or impact, and actually got up and running in very short order,\u201d Sebelius said.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Sebelius on Obamacare: Change the name)\n\nThere are plenty of Democrats who have had second thoughts about the Affordable Care Act \u2014 about the timing of the law\u2019s passage, the decision to move ahead without Republican votes, the unqualified promises that everyone could keep their health care plans, and, of course, the competence of the launch. But for all of the political agony Sebelius went through \u2014 first during the bitter congressional debates that led to its passage, then during the botched rollout \u2014 she\u2019s not much for second-guessing.\n\nSebelius does have ideas on what would help future political leaders launch programs that represent a complicated technological undertaking. She says the contracting process needs to be overhauled so the promising start-up gurus can be tapped, not just the same old companies that get the contracts mainly because they\u2019ve worked with the federal government before. And she says the technology teams need to work directly with the officials who know the policy, something that didn\u2019t happen enough before the enrollment launch last year.\n\nBut unlike Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), Sebelius has no regrets about turning to health care reform right at the beginning of Barack Obama\u2019s presidency. Schumer argues that the Democrats addressed the \u201cwrong problem\u201d by taking on health care reform in 2009 rather than keeping their focus on the recession. Sebelius, however, sticks to the view Obama and most Democratic leaders held at the time: If health care reform didn\u2019t get done then, with a newly elected president and Democrats at the height of their power, it was never going to happen.\n\n\u201cI certainly would have much preferred a very smooth rollout and robust enrollment from day one. But I also feel very good about the fact that this president was able to get a law passed that 70 years of debate prior to him, of both Republican and Democratic presidents, had failed to do,\u201d Sebelius said.\n\nAnd unlike Joseph Califano, the former Lyndon B. Johnson adviser who has questioned the decision to move ahead without buy-in from the Republicans, Sebelius doesn\u2019t think it was a mistake to launch a program on Obamacare\u2019s scale once it became clear that Republicans wouldn\u2019t support it. That decision set the stage for years of fights and repeal efforts that are still going on today, nearly five years after its passage \u2014 unlike Medicare, which was passed with Republican votes and became accepted by the public far more quickly.\n\nIn Sebelius\u2019 view, Democrats did try to get Republicans on board when the bill was being negotiated. Then-Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus tried for months, she said, and she and other administration officials visited with Republicans on the Hill many times. \u201cBut I think at the end of the day, he knew that this was a moment in time, and if it did not happen at this moment, there was no guarantee it would ever happen,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it was one of the things that he felt very strongly about, very personally about, and also had promised the American public that he would do.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou hear echoes of that debate in immigration. Would people like a bipartisan, comprehensive approach to immigration? You bet,\u201d Sebelius said. But \u201cthe only way to move forward is really executive authority right now, because there isn\u2019t a bipartisan approach.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "&quot;I think it was not only well worth it, but a battle worth fighting,&quot; she says.", "title": "Regrets on Obamacare?
