Mike Pence (R) authorizes a bill that could allow businesses to discriminate against LGBT customers, Polygon reported on Tuesday.\n\nGenCon LLC chief executive officer Adrian Swartout released a letter he sent to Pence (PDF) touting the convention\u2019s history of serving \u201ca diverse attendee base, made up of different ethnicities, cultures, beliefs, sexual orientations, gender identities, abilities, and socio-economic backgrounds.\u201d\n\nSwartout said that the gaming convention drew 56,000 people to the Indianapolis Convention Center last year, and brings in $50 million worth of business on an annual basis. Though the event is under contract to be held in Indianapolis through 2020, Swartout said, Pence signing Senate Bill 101 into law \u201cwill factor into our decision-making on hosting the convention in the state of Indiana in future years.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Indianapolis Star, the bill would prevent state and local governments from \u201csubstantially burdening\u201d state residents regarding their religious practices without a compelling interest.\n\nIt is reportedly modeled after the the Religious Freedom and Restoration Act, which was a key factor in the Supreme Court decision that allowed Hobby Lobby and other corporate entities to use religious grounds as the basis for opting out of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s contraceptive care mandate. Critics argued that the bill effectively legalizes anti-LGBT discrimination.\n\n\u201cIt basically says to a group of people you\u2019re second rate, you don\u2019t matter, and if you walk into my store, I don\u2019t have to serve you,\u201d state Minority Leader Scott Pelath (D) said while debating the measure.\n\nThe bill passed in the Republican-controlled state Senate on Tuesday, a day after it was approved by the state House. Pence voiced his support for the measure in a statement following the House vote.\n\n\u201cThe legislation, SB 101, is about respecting and reassuring Hoosiers that their religious freedoms are intact,\u201d the governor\u2019s statement read. \u201cI strongly support the legislation and applaud the members of the General Assembly for their work on this important issue. I look forward to signing the bill when it reaches my desk.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for the Indianapolis travel bureau, Chris Gahl, told the Star that Swartout\u2019s group contacted the agency before releasing the letter to Pence. Gahl added that his agency has also come out against the measure.\n\n\u201cOur concern is that there could be a misperception with this bill that doesn\u2019t paint a picture of being a warm, welcoming, hospitable place,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t align with the brand that is Indianapolis, and for that matter, Indiana. Because it could impact our ability to win convention business down the road \u2014 and keep convention business \u2014 we raised our hand and said we do have a concern.\u201d\n\nPolygon reported that GenCon\u2019s heavy drawing power was one factor in a $275 million expansion project that added about 200,000 square feet of floor space to the convention center. The city is slated to host the NCAA men\u2019s basketball national semifinals and finals starting on Saturday.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Good-friends-playing-video-games-Shutterstock-800x430.jpg", "height": 430}, "title": "Geeks for gay rights: $50 million gaming convention threatens to leave Indiana over anti-LGBT bill"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "article_summary": "Mike Pence (R) authorizes a bill that could allow businesses to discriminate against LGBT customers, Polygon reported on Tuesday.\nThe bill passed in the Republican-controlled state Senate on Tuesday, a day after it was approved by the state House.\nThe organizers of one of the biggest conventions in Indiana suggested they would take the event out of the state if Gov.\n\u201cThe legislation, SB 101, is about respecting and reassuring Hoosiers that their religious freedoms are intact,\u201d the governor\u2019s statement read.\n\u201cI strongly support the legislation and applaud the members of the General Assembly for their work on this important issue."}
