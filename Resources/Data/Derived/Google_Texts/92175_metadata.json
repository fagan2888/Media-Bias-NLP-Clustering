Matt Mead\u2019s budget, which would have provided health care to about 20,000 Wyomingites, failed in committee Wednesday morning.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not terribly surprising,\u201d said Hollis Hackman, a Sheridan resident who works with Healthy Wyoming.\n\nThe provision failed by one vote in the Joint Appropriations Committee, which is meeting in the days prior to the 2016 legislative budget session, which begins Feb. 8.\n\nMedicaid expansion in Wyoming is still possible, though unlikely. This year\u2019s legislative session is a 20-day budget session and in order for bills to be introduced for debate, two-thirds of legislators must find them worthy. Legislators also only have 20 working-days to pass the state\u2019s biennial budget.\n\nThe provision in Mead\u2019s budget proposal would have provided $268 million in federal health care funding. In a year when the state has cut more than $30 million from the Wyoming Department of Health\u2019s budget, Medicaid expansion proponents said its failure is unacceptable.\n\n\u201cExpansion will benefit every sector of our economy \u2014 small and large businesses, health care providers, hospitals and more than 20,000 Wyomingites who work hard but can\u2019t afford insurance,\u201d Healthy Wyoming Co-chair Briana Jones said in a statement.\n\nBetter Wyoming Executive Director Adam Croft expressed disappointment in the provision\u2019s failure as well.\n\n\u201cMy general reaction: It\u2019s pretty deplorable with the state facing an economic downturn and the legislature not passing a program that benefits Wyomingites. The worst part is that there are Wyomingites who have died as a result of not having access to health care,\u201d Croft said.\n\nRep. Tim Stubson, R-Casper, made the motion to strike the provision from the governor\u2019s budget. Stubson said he made the motion because policy issues do not belong in an appropriations debate.\n\n\u201cSome legislators say it (expanding Medicaid) shouldn\u2019t be discussed as a part of the budget \u2014 it enhances the budget,\u201d Croft countered.\n\nAfter the provision failed, several committee members expressed their disapproval and pointed out that the Legislature will need to find $33 million in health care funding that the governor expected to receive from the federal government.\n\nOf that, $11.4 million would have gone to Wyoming\u2019s involuntary hospitalization program, also known as Title 25.\n\nSen. Drew Perkins, R-Casper, spoke in opposition of expanding Medicaid.\n\nPerkins said other states that have expanded Medicaid have gone over budget and that able-bodied people refuse to work as a result of not having to pay for health insurance.\n\nRep. Cathy Connolly, D-Laramie, said the people being denied health insurance are regular Wyomingites.\n\n\u201cThese are the folks who could be moved to Medicaid. It\u2019s a 35-year-old with diabetes. These people are invisible to us,\u201d Connolly said.\n\nConnolly added that the JAC makes more than 500 decisions during their pre-session meetings.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the most important,\u201d Connolly said.\n\nMedicaid expansion is a result of the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010. After the act went into the law, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that states have the option of accepting federal dollars to provide health insurance to residents whose household income is below 133 percent of the federal poverty level.\n\nMedicaid expansion advocates also feel that accepting federal funds is the fiscally responsible decision with Wyoming facing a $617 million budget shortfall.\n\nAttempts to contact Sen. Bruce Burns, R-Sheridan, who serves on the JAC, were unsuccessful.\n\nIf the provision passed, Wyoming would have been the 32nd state to expand Medicaid.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Sheridan Press", "description": "SHERIDAN \u2014 A provision in Gov.
