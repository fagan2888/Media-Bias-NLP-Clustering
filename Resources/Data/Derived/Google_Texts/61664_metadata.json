This group, along with retirees in general, is now firmly in the sights of government as it seeks to meet the needs of an aging population.\n\nThat message was at the heart of just about every panel discussion at Monday\u2019s White House Conference on Aging, a once-per-decade gathering meant to \u201clook ahead to the issues that will help shape the landscape for older Americans.\u201d It\u2019s a worthy topic. Longevity is changing the economic and social picture for everyone. But not all are happy with what seems like a stale approach.\n\n\n\nRather than focusing on things like eldercare and health problems, leaders in this area should be addressing ways to keep seniors active and \u201cdebunk the myths and stigma of aging,\u201d Michael Hodin, executive director of the Global Council on Aging, writes in his blog.\n\nGranted, issues surrounding caregiving and the financial exploitation of seniors must be examined. But keeping aging Americans productive\u2014not dependent\u2014is a challenge that calls for being proactive. Likewise, leaders need to adopt an innovative approach to education and saving. They must rethink the whole notion of retirement in a world where young people will have few safety nets, may work 60 years, and will be required to reinvent themselves over and over.\n\nThese themes weren\u2019t missing entirely from the conference. Andy Sieg, head of global wealth and retirement solutions at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, spoke of the importance of paying off college loans and beginning to save early in life. Both of those are Millennials\u2019 issues and by definition require taking far-sighted steps.\n\nRobin Diamonte, chief investment officer at United Technologies, further spoke to the long-term savings issue when she said at her company \u201cwe are auto everything-ing,\u201d a nod to the vital role that automatic enrollment of new employees in 401(k) plans and automatic escalation of contributions can play.\n\nSign up for and more view example\n\nStill, the dominant themes of the conference focused on coping with old age and failing cognitive and general health, along with elders\u2019 financial pressures. The best measure of a society is how it treats its older citizens, President Obama said, using the occasion to champion his legacy. Obamacare has extended the solvency of the Medicare trust fund by 13 years and helped nine million seniors save $15 billion on prescription drugs, he said. He called out Congress for not passing a tax-advantaged federal savings program for workers not eligible for an employer sponsored plan\u2014the \u201cauto IRA\u201d. And he promised that by year-end he would roll out \u201ca path for states\u201d to offer such plans.\n\nAlso on Obama\u2019s priority list are programs to educate prosecutors about elder abuse, upgrade nursing home facilities and promote flexible work schedules for family members who are caregivers. Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell announced $35.7 million of funding for \u201cgeriatric workforce training\u201d to raise the quality of both family and paid caregiving.\n\nPointing up the critical role that private employers must play in solving longevity issues, Sieg announced that Merrill Lynch would begin working with benefits and human resources professionals at 35,000 companies, offering up the latest gerontology research around continued employment and other retiree issues. Merrill is believed to be the only major bank with an executive gerontologist on staff.\n\nA panel on financial security noted that the biggest obstacles to a secure retirement for all include expanding the popular concept of retirement to include productive engagement, getting people to save early, and finding ways to convert lifetime savings into lifetime income with easy low-fee annuities. These, at least, are proactive ideas\u2014and that\u2019s where the real solutions lie.\n\nRead next: Here\u2019s What You Can Really Expect from Social Security", "article_metadata": {"description": "At a once-per-decade conference, the White House unveils an action plan some aging experts believe is ho-hum.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "MONEY.com", "description": "At a once-per-decade conference, the White House unveils an action plan some aging experts believe is ho-hum.", "title": "How Obama Plans to Save Your Retirement", "url": "http://time.com/money/3956549/retirement-obama-save/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/150714_ret_obama.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "MONEY", "image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/150714_ret_obama.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "description": "At a once-per-decade conference, the White House unveils an action plan some aging experts believe is ho-hum.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "How Obama Plans to Save Your Retirement"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MoneyMagazine"}, "keywords": ", aging, auto ira, caregiving, elder abuse, iras, longevity, retirement planning", "google-site-verification": "nFxFQf8F4Xgg0b9Ap9rOUJzg7MY74LicbBIzsLo8yIg", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "retirement, income, IRAs, White House Conference on Aging, Obama, Obamacare, Medicare, caregiving, longevity, aging"}, "article_summary": "Obamacare has extended the solvency of the Medicare trust fund by 13 years and helped nine million seniors save $15 billion on prescription drugs, he said.\nAndy Sieg, head of global wealth and retirement solutions at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, spoke of the importance of paying off college loans and beginning to save early in life.\nAnd he promised that by year-end he would roll out \u201ca path for states\u201d to offer such plans.\nThe best measure of a society is how it treats its older citizens, President Obama said, using the occasion to champion his legacy.\nA panel on financial security noted that the biggest obstacles to a secure retirement for all include expanding the popular concept of retirement to include productive engagement, getting people to save early, and finding ways to convert lifetime savings into lifetime income with easy low-fee annuities."}
