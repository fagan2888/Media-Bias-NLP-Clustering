Obama\u2019s late discovery is especially remarkable considering that he built his entire political philosophy on the rock of Big Government, on the fervent belief in the state as the very engine of collective action and the ultimate source of national greatness. (Indeed, of individual success as well, as in \u201cIf you\u2019ve got a business \u2014 you didn\u2019t build that. Somebody else made that happen.\u201d)\n\nThis blinding revelation of the ponderous incompetence of bureaucratic government came just a few weeks after Obama confessed that \u201cwhat we\u2019re also discovering is that insurance is complicated to buy.\u201d Another light bulb goes off, this one three years after passing a law designed to force millions of Americans to shop for new health plans via the maze of untried, untested, insecure, unreliable online \u201cexchanges.\u201d\n\nThis discovery joins a long list that includes Obama\u2019s rueful admission that there really are no shovel-ready jobs. That one came after having passed his monstrous $830 billion stimulus on the argument that the weakened economy would be \u201cjump-started\u201d by a massive infusion of shovel-ready jobs. Now known to be fictional.\n\n1 of 25 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 The Right\u2019s 25 most influential, from Townhall.com View Photos The conservative Web site\u2019s latest listing of the most prominent voices on the right, with a few names you may not know.

The biggest right-wing radio show host in America has spoken to a generation of conservatives. Micah Walter/Reuters Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue.\n\nBarack Obama is not just late to discover the most elementary workings of government. With alarming regularity, he professes obliviousness to the workings of his own government. He claims, for example, to have known nothing about the IRS targeting scandal, the AP phone records scandal, the NSA tapping of Angela Merkel. And had not a clue that the centerpiece of his signature legislative achievement \u2014 the online Obamacare exchange, three years in the making \u2014 would fail catastrophically upon launch. Or that Obamacare would cause millions of Americans to lose their private health plans.\n\nHence the odd spectacle of a president expressing surprise and disappointment in the federal government \u2014 as if he\u2019s not the one running it. Hence the repeated no-one-is-more-upset-than-me posture upon deploring the nonfunctioning Web site, the IRS outrage, the AP intrusions and any number of scandals from which Obama tries to create safe distance by posing as an observer. He gives the impression of a man on a West Wing tour trying out the desk in the Oval Office, only to be told that he is president of the United States.\n\nThe paradox of this presidency is that this most passive bystander president is at the same time the most ideologically ambitious in decades. The sweep and scope of his health-care legislation alone are unprecedented. He\u2019s spent billions of tax money attempting to create, by fiat and ex nihilo, a new green economy. His (failed) cap-and-trade bill would have given him regulatory control of the energy economy. He wants universal preschool and has just announced his unwavering commitment to slaying the dragon of economic inequality, which, like the poor, has always been with us.\n\nObama\u2019s discovery that government bureaucracies don\u2019t do things very well creates a breathtaking disconnect between his transformative ambitions and his detachment from the job itself. How does his Olympian vision coexist with the lassitude of his actual governance, a passivity that verges on absenteeism?\n\nWhat bridges that gap is rhetoric. Barack Obama is a master rhetorician. It\u2019s allowed him to move crowds, rise inexorably and twice win the most glittering prize of all. Rhetoric has changed his reality. For Obama, it can change the country\u2019s. Hope and change, after all, is a rhetorical device. Of the kind Obama has always imagined can move mountains.\n\nThat\u2019s why his reaction to the Obamacare Web site\u2019s crash-on-takeoff is so telling. His remedy? A cross-country campaign-style speaking tour. As if rhetoric could repeal that reality.\n\nManaging, governing, negotiating, cajoling, crafting legislation, forging compromise. For these \u2014 this stuff of governance \u2014 Obama has shown little aptitude and even less interest. Perhaps, as Valerie Jarrett has suggested, he is simply too easily bored to invest his greatness in such mundanity.\n\n1 of 20 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Top opinions stories of 2013 View Photos From Trayvon Martin to Obamacare: Take a look at a selection of the stories that caught readers\u2019 interests over the past year.
