The protester, a woman from Michigan who declined to give her name, managed to sneak into the tightly secured, invitation-only service and interrupt the introduction.\n\n\u201cJesus Christ is on that cross over there,\u201d she yelled. \u201cGet out of our church. Leave our church alone.\u201d\n\nThe woman was physically removed from the prayer service by a reverend and cathedral police, and the service got underway.\n\nEbrahim Rasool, the South African ambassador to the United States, who is Muslim, gave a sermon that preached religious freedom and condemned Muslim extremists as a dangerous threat to the world.\n\n\u201cThey invade lands, behead journalists, execute civilians and declare war on anyone different to them,\u201d he said.\n\nRasool and the National Cathedral\u2019s Reverend Canon Gina Campbell organized the service, with help from the All Dulles Area Muslim Society, Council on American-Islamic Relations, Islamic Society of North America, Muslim Public Affairs Council and The Nation\u2019s Mosque.\n\nCampbell welcomed the religious gathering, saying the Washington National Cathedral was \u201ca place of prayer for all people.\n\n\u201cLet us stretch our hearts and let us seek to deepen mercy for we worship the same God,\u201d she said.\n\nSince 1907, the Neo-Gothic Episcopal church has been used for state funerals for three presidents, and a number of presidential prayer services. It also has hosted services for noted diplomats and dignitaries.\n\nOrganizers said they hoped the service on a Friday, when Muslims traditionally gather for prayers, would foster interfaith understanding and tolerance.\n\nAfter the service, outside the church, the protester said she was not arrested, and was not harmed in the altercation. She did not explain why she disrupted the service.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t do it for myself,\u201d she said. \u201cI did it for the Lord.\u201d\n\nThe protester was not alone in denouncing the Muslim prayer service at the National Cathedral. Reverend Franklin Graham, the son of evangelist Billy Graham who is one of America\u2019s foremost Christian leaders, took to his Facebook page on Thursday to criticize the plan to host the gathering.", "article_metadata": {"description": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The first Muslim prayer service ever hosted at the National Cathedral, a landmark Christian church in the U.S. capital, was briefly interrupted on Friday by a lone anti-Islamic protester but the religious gathering continued with a theme of tolerance.
