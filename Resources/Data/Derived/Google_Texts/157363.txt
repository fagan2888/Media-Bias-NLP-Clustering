Carolyn has covered health and science for WHYY since 2010 and is a contributor to the weekly show The Pulse.

Her passion for bringing listeners stories of science in action has taken her from a bat cave in Pennsylvania to jellyfish-infested waters near the Jersey shore and a shark-tagging boat in the Delaware Bay.

Her radio stories air on Morning Edition, All Things Considered and NewsWorks Tonight, and her TV reporting appears on the Delaware newsmagazine First.

From 2013 to 2014, Carolyn worked in Berlin, Germany as a Robert Bosch Foundation Fellow, where she wrote for the international newswire AFP and produced radio specials for NPR Berlin. She was a 2012 Metlife Foundation Journalists in Aging Fellow and is the winner of both national and regional awards for her reporting.

Carolyn got her start behind the microphone at National Public Radio in Washington, DC. She has worked as a journalist in Chicago, Seattle, and Cape Town, South Africa. She studied journalism and history at Northwestern University.
