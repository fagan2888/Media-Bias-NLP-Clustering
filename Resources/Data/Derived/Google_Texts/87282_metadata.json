Even its wisdom tends to undermine Robinson\u2019s point as a whole, however, and his lack of research into recent history demolishes his overall argument. Let\u2019s start with what Robinson gets right:\n\nIn general, I try to focus on what a person does or says rather than speculate on what he or she \u201cis.\u201d How can I really know what\u2019s in another person\u2019s heart?\n\nThat is the essence of the charitable approach to politics \u2014 to address one\u2019s arguments and to presume that they are made in good faith. Unfortunately, Robinson spends most of his column defending Jay Rockefeller, who did exactly the opposite of what Robinson prescribes for everyone else. Instead of addressing the issues surrounding ObamaCare, Rockefeller accused opponents of being motivated by Obama\u2019s skin color. Robinson ends up defending Rockefeller by claiming that Rockefeller didn\u2019t accuse anyone specifically of being racist:\n\nWhen Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-W.Va.) remarked last week that some of the opposition to President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act is \u201cmaybe he\u2019s of the wrong color,\u201d he was just saying out loud what many people believe. And no, he wasn\u2019t calling Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) a \u201cracist.\u201d Believing that some of the Republican and tea party opposition to Obama has to do with his race is not, I repeat not, the same as saying that anyone who disagrees with the nation\u2019s first black president is racist.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting, and Robinson ignores, that this was in the middle of a debate about ObamaCare \u2014 and Johnson was the only Republican on the panel at that time. Robinson twists himself in knots trying to eat his cake and have it too. He\u2019s essentially arguing that he can determine group guilt but wants to refrain from determining individual guilt because he can\u2019t see into individual hearts \u2014 as if diving the nature of thousands or millions of hearts is made easier in bulk.\n\nRobinson then goes on to prove his error by applying this axiom:\n\nI\u2019m reminded of a tea party rally at the Capitol four years ago when Congress was about to pass the Affordable Care Act. I can\u2019t say that the demonstrators who hissed and spat at members of the Congressional Black Caucus were racists \u2014 but I saw them committing racist acts. I can\u2019t say that the people holding \u201cTake Back Our Country\u201d signs were racists \u2014 but I know this rallying cry arose after the first African American family moved into the White House.\n\nThis argument only proves that the Washington Post really should either provide Nexis access to its columnists or get better editors for its opinion section. Byron York takes Robinson to the woodshed over this claim:\n\nIn the 2004 race, Democratic nominee Sen. John Kerry sometimes asked supporters to help him \u201ctake back our country.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s time to take back our country,\u201d Kerry declared at a rally in Manchester, New Hampshire in late October. When Kerry called Sen. John Edwards to invite him onto the Democratic ticket, aides revealed that Kerry\u2019s words to Edwards were, \u201cJohn, Teresa and I would like to ask you and Elizabeth to join us on our ticket to take back our country.\u201d Early Democratic frontrunner Howard Dean used the phrase \u201ctake back our country\u201d too many times to count. In fact, Dean wrote a campaign book titled \u201cYou Have the Power: How to Take Back Our Country and Restore Democracy in America.\u201d Former Vice President Al Gore said it, too. \u201cWe need to take back our country,\u201d Gore declared in endorsing Dean in January 2004. At a Democratic fundraiser in December 2003, Sen. Hillary Clinton pledged to work \u201con behalf of a campaign to take back our country.\u201d After the election, in 2005, Clinton declared that, \u201cWe are ready to go forth and fight to take back our country.\u201d From the podium of the Democratic National Convention in July 2004, Rep. Louise Slaughter declared, \u201cWe will take back our country.\u201d Also at the convention, Sen. Debbie Stabenow said, \u201cWe\u2019re here to take back our country.\u201d And Los Angeles leader Antonio Villaraigosa, chair of the party platform committee, declared, \u201cWe Democrats have come to this convention\u2026to take back our country!\u201d And it didn\u2019t stop with the 2004 campaign. Hillary Clinton used \u201ctake back our country\u201d countless times in her 2008 presidential race. And when Clinton finally conceded defeat and endorsed Barack Obama, she said, with Obama right next to her, that, \u201cWe are not going to rest until we take back our country.\u201d\n\nThis has been standard political rhetoric for at least as long as I\u2019ve followed politics. Without a doubt, the slogan represents many different motivations, but that\u2019s as true of \u201cTake Back Our Country\u201d as \u201cSupport the Troops.\u201d Robinson either just started following politics in 2009, or has his own reasons for skipping research and ignoring the avalanche of evidence that eminently disproves his point.\n\nWhat are those reasons? Well, I can\u2019t see into Robinson\u2019s heart, but perhaps Robinson will explain them in his next column. Perhaps he can headline it, \u201cHope and Change.\u201d\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Projection.", "title": "On the history of \u201cTake Back Our Country\u201d", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/05/27/on-the-history-of-take-back-our-country/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-05-27T13:21:32+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-05-27T13:01:18+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe need to take back our country,\u201d Gore declared in endorsing Dean in January 2004.\nHillary Clinton used \u201ctake back our country\u201d countless times in her 2008 presidential race.\nEven its wisdom tends to undermine Robinson\u2019s point as a whole, however, and his lack of research into recent history demolishes his overall argument.\nUnfortunately, Robinson spends most of his column defending Jay Rockefeller, who did exactly the opposite of what Robinson prescribes for everyone else.\nWell, I can\u2019t see into Robinson\u2019s heart, but perhaps Robinson will explain them in his next column."}
