Although you may be an enrolled member, a few days might need to pass before your ID card shows up in the mail. You might need proof of enrollment before your card arrives, though. No need to worry. You can prove you are a Kentucky Health Cooperative plan member by providing your member ID.\"\n\nProviders may verify eligibility by calling 1-855-OUR-KYHC (855-687-5942).\n\nMember assistance is available at this same number, 1-855-687-5942. Please note that call volume is heavy and that wait times are long. If the decision is made to call, enrollees should have their member ID handy, if known. This information is referenced in Kentucky Health Cooperative Acknowledgement Letter or premium invoice.\n\nDue to heavy call volume, Member Services will continue to work on an expanded schedule through Friday, Jan. 10, 8 a.m.-8 p.m. Eastern Time.\n\nConsumers who have not yet enrolled in a Kentucky Health Cooperative plan may call 1-877-334-1726 to speak with a licensed agent who can assist with selection of one of the issuer's Affordable Care Act-qualified health plans. March 31, 2014 is the deadline for signing up for coverage without being subject to a penalty.\n\nVisit www.mykyhc.org for information about additional payment options.\n\nKentucky Health Cooperative\n\nKentucky Health Cooperative, based in Louisville, is dedicated to improving health outcomes by providing member-focused, accessible, cost-effective and quality-focused health care coverage to individuals and small groups living in the Commonwealth of Kentucky.
