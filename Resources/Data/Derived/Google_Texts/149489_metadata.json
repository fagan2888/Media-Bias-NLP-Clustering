UPDATE: Jon Stewart Secretly Met with Obama, Worked \u2018In Concert\u2019 with White House. Potemkin Village? We\u2019ve got a whole freakin\u2019 Potemkin Culture.\n\nIndeed. This line popped out at me, in the Mediaite report: According to former Obama aide Austan Goolsbee, \u201cthe president wanted to counter his critics on the left and lay the groundwork for his 2012 re-election campaign.\u201d\n\nKind of wonder if co-ordination between a White House and influential members of media during a Presidential campaign should be considered, at the very least, an in-kind contribution, and noted as such. Otherwise, that\u2019s kind of like\u2026fraud, isn\u2019t it?\n\nYes, we all know politics is illusion; entertainment is illusion. Increasingly, \u201cthe news\u201d is illusion, too \u2014 more analysis than content, more opinion than fact. The patina of dispassion our news media once at least attempted to keep polished and intact has been completely worn away by a continual drizzle of partisan acid, and now the corrosion is exposed for all to see. Like headstones in an untended graveyard, their forms and shapes are altered; their essential natures \u2014 blockish and immovable \u2014 are on display.\n\nWe\u2019ve always been surrounded by fakery, but \u2014 as with any masquarade \u2014 until the masques come off, you can convince yourself that you\u2019re traveling with what is before your eyes. That seems no longer possible. Everything is, as Elaine Benes once admitted:\n\nYep, it\u2019s all fake. Social science reports? Fake. Much of Obamacare rhetoric? Fake. DOE discrimination reports? Fake. Job gains? Fake. New and Improved Clintons? Fake, fake, fake, fake, fake. Something as sturdy, reliable and innocuous as the New York Times Bestseller list? Fake.\n\nOh, and Planned parenthood\u2019s insistence that certain videos were faked via editing? fake. The assurances that a quest for \u201cmarriage equality\u201d would threaten no church or livelihood? yeahhh\u2026that\u2019s still developing.\n\nMasques are coming off. It\u2019s a good thing. You have to have the masques in your hand to see what you\u2019re dealing with (if it is visible to the eye) and to understand what is inexorably barreling down the pike at you.\n\nOf course, by then, it may be too late to do anything about it.\n\nThen, summoning the wild courage of despair, a throng of the revellers at once threw themselves into the black apartment, and, seizing the mummer, whose tall figure stood erect and motionless within the shadow of the ebony clock, gasped in unutterable horror at finding the grave-cerements and corpse-like mask which they handled with so violent a rudeness, untenanted by any tangible form. And now was acknowledged the presence of the Red Death\u2026\n\nExcuse me. Pleurisy again.
