To the Editor:

Re “Help for the Way We Work Now,” by Sara Horowitz (Op-Ed, Sept. 7):

I have been a freelance production manager in the film, video and trade show businesses for more than 30 years. The two biggest drawbacks to freelancing are unaffordable health insurance (even with the Affordable Care Act) and not being able to file for unemployment benefits.

In this so-called gig economy, we desperately need safety nets. Freelancing is an incredibly difficult way to make a living. We not only work the gig, but unless we are fortunate enough to be successful, we are also constantly looking for work.

Sure we have our freedoms, like flexible schedules, but when work is scarce, life may become unmanageable. Freelancing can provide a good quality of life only if you’re have enough work, and have money set aside for the slow times.

Now that the number of people in the “gig economy” is growing fast enough for the politicians to pay attention to us, they also need to realize that not everyone is capable of being an entrepreneur. We need a single-payer health care system, access to unemployment benefits and a workable retirement plan.

If these measures are not carried out, many people will not be able to survive. If it weren’t for the health insurance offered through my wife’s full-time job, I would not be able to remain a freelancer.
