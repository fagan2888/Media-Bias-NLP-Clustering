Pete Sessions (R-Texas) and Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) does not fully repeal ObamaCare, a notable departure from the GOP\u2019s long-stated goal.\n\nBut it would eliminate many central aspects of the Affordable Care Act, including the mandates for individuals to have coverage and for employers to provide it, as well as requirements for what an insurance plan must cover.\n\nThe core of the plan is a $2,500 tax credit that any citizen would be eligible for and use to purchase health insurance. The lawmakers say this gives flexibility to people, whether they get employer-based insurance or not, to more directly control their healthcare spending, for example by using a health savings account.\n\nSessions and Cassidy are putting forward their plan as a task force set up by Speaker Paul Ryan Paul RyanFeds can learn lessons from states about using data to inform policy House passes resurrected LGBT measure Ryan seeks to put stamp on GOP in Trump era MORE (R-Wis.) is nearing the release of its own plan to fully repeal ObamaCare and replace it with an alternative.\n\nSessions, the chairman of the powerful House Rules Committee, said in an interview that his plan is not meant to compete with that effort.\n\n\u201cEverybody's submitting their ideas, so it's very complimentary,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Ryan-backed task force, though, will not be releasing a bill; it will instead be a general outline of ideas.\n\n\u201cThe thing that makes us different is we made a bill out of it, and that's the hard part,\u201d Sessions said. \u201cIt's really easy to have ideas. It's really hard to put it in a bill that works.\u201d\n\nUnder the Sessions-Cassidy plan, people currently with insurance through the ObamaCare marketplaces could keep it because they would be grandfathered in.\n\nBut new ObamaCare enrollees would no longer be eligible for ObamaCare\u2019s financial assistance. Instead, they would receive the new plan\u2019s $2,500 tax credit, according to John Goodman, a health economist who worked with Sessions and Cassidy on the plan.\n\nThe new tax credit is a flat sum, as opposed to ObamaCare\u2019s tax credits, which increase for lower-income people. Therefore, Goodman said, lower-income people would receive less assistance under the Sessions-Cassidy plan, but higher-income people could receive more.\n\nSessions defended the decision to allow current ObamaCare plans to be grandfathered in if people want to keep them.\n\n\u201cI want to be fair about this,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you want that, you ought to have it; I mean, we're in a world of options.\u201d\n\nThe Sessions-Cassidy bill also shakes up the current system of not taxing health insurance plans provided through employers, which can be politically fraught. However, the plan allows employers to opt to stay in the current system if they want, and only opt in to the new tax credit if they choose.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The bill comes as a task force from Speaker Paul Ryan continues its work.", "description": "The bill comes as a task force from Speaker Paul Ryan continues its work.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Peter Sullivan", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The bill comes as a task force from Speaker Paul Ryan continues its work.", "title": "GOP lawmakers unveil ObamaCare replacement bill", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/280604-pair-of-gop-lawmakers-unveils-obamacare-replacement-bill", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/obamacare_042215getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-05-19T17:27:10-04:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-05-19T17:27-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/280604-pair-of-gop-lawmakers-unveils-obamacare-replacement-bill", "dcterms.date": "2016-05-19T17:08-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Peter Sullivan", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Health insurance, Tax credit, Internal Revenue Service, Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act,Paul Ryan,", "article": {"published_time": "2016-05-19T17:08:49-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-19T17:27:10-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/280604-pair-of-gop-lawmakers-unveils-obamacare-replacement-bill", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The bill comes as a task force from Speaker Paul Ryan continues its work.", "card": "summary", "title": "GOP lawmakers unveil ObamaCare replacement bill"}, "dcterms.title": "GOP lawmakers unveil ObamaCare replacement bill"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8f1d\"", "article_summary": "The new tax credit is a flat sum, as opposed to ObamaCare\u2019s tax credits, which increase for lower-income people.\nTherefore, Goodman said, lower-income people would receive less assistance under the Sessions-Cassidy plan, but higher-income people could receive more.\nThe core of the plan is a $2,500 tax credit that any citizen would be eligible for and use to purchase health insurance.\nTwo Republican lawmakers on Thursday introduced an alternative to ObamaCare as the House develops its own healthcare plan.\nADVERTISEMENTThe bill from Rep.
