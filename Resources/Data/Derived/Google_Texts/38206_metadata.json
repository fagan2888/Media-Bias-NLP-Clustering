Juan Payan, a businessman from Mexico, has yet to meet his.\n\nUninsured and in jeopardized health, the 67-year-old shopping center owner and former importer from San Luis Potosi travelled across the border to Texas, where he paid some $200,000 in cash for a kidney transplant at Houston Methodist Hospital.\n\n\u201cPeople with money come here,\u201d Payan told the Houston Chronicle through an interpreter following his surgery earlier this year. \u201cI feel safe with the physicians. Here, they perform the surgery every eight days. They don\u2019t do it in Mexico that often. I trust Houston.\u201d\n\nPayan has so much confidence in the Texas Medical Center that he accrued about $300,000 in expenses \u2013 including $8,000 a month for a furnished, two-bedroom apartment for himself and his wife \u2013 to receive the best care that Houston has to offer.\n\nAbout 20,000 medical tourism patients like Payan travel to Houston each year from international destinations for medical care. Cross-border healthcare pumps $38.5 billion to $55 billion annually into local economies.\n\nPatient Pools\n\nDr. Robert Robbins, CEO of the Texas Medical Center, wants to dip into those lucrative medical tourism revenues, first by rebuilding transforming the 1,345-acre complex into the world\u2019s healthcare destination \u2013 and that means rebuilding its international patient base.\n\nTexas Medical Center is swimming in a pool of competing nations who are looking to entice somewhat wealthy international patients looking to jump into medical tourism. Countries like Germany, Thailand, Japan, Costa Rica, Brazil, India, South Korea and Mexico among others are providing stiff competition, offering care that compares favorable \u2013 if not better \u2013 than what is offered in the United States \u2013 and at lower costs.\n\nThe Greater Houston Partnership figures that for every $1 a medical tourism patient spends on healthcare through the Texas Medical Center, at least another $2 will benefit the local economy by generating commerce and jobs.\n\nRen\u00e9e-Marie Stephano, President of the Medical Tourism Association\u00ae, said hospitals like the Texas Medical Center are seeking out affiliations with foreign healthcare facilities, medical schools and private companies and setting up overseas offices to build name recognition and, in the end, lure patients. But, finding international healthcare consumers \u2013 even in a world where everyone gets sick \u2013 can still be a daunting task.\n\n\u201cProfessional or word-of-mouth referrals alone can\u2019t be counted on to sustain an international patient department or private practice that caters to medical tourism,\u201d said Stephano. \u201cAnd Facebook, Google and other digital marketing campaigns are overwhelming in time spent sorting through irrelevant and insincere patient contacts. Too often, patients who really want treatments and deserve care can fall through the cracks.\u201d\n\nThere has to be a better way. Stephano said there is.\n\n\u201cAsk a Patient: Making Dollars and Sense Out of the Medical Tourism Experience,\u201d will stream questions and answers from real and active healthcare consumers who know best about what they want and deserve from health travel at the 7th World Medical Tourism & Global Healthcare Congress, Sept. 20-24, 2014, at the Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center, in Washington, D.C. The live interactive webcast, Sept, 23, 2014, connects patients from all over the world to the hospital administrators, doctors and clinicians, facilitators, insurance executive and hospitality and travel interests that make medical tourism happen.\n\nRoads from U.S. border states lead to the Mexico state of Baja California for medical tourism opportunities in dentistry, optometry, sports medicine and surgeries.\n\nTwo-Way Street\n\nStephano said competition is good for consumers. Healthcare providers are discovering new ideas to improve care from each other, and patients in the United States now recognize they no longer need to look very far for treatments. Medical tourism is booming in Mexico, where U.S. patients are finding inexpensive elective surgeries that, in all likelihood, are not covered under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIn the Mexican state of Baja California \u2013 a sponsor of the World Medical Tourism & Global Healthcare Congress \u2013 health travel is up 18 percent from 2010, fueled by some 450,000 patients who annually visit cities like Tijuana and Mexicali for dentistry, optometry, sports medicine and surgeries.\n\n\u201cForeign revenue from medical tourism patients coming to Baja California annually reaches $89 million,\u201d said Juan Benjamin Tintos Funcke, Secretary of Tourism for Baja California. \u201cWe continue to improve our medical infrastructure and appeal to health travelers by promoting our 10 hospitals, 600 medical specialists and 12 pharmaceutical chains.\u201d\n\nFuncke said an investment of $15 million pesos to target 15 million medical tourism patients is projected to translate into US$8 million in additional revenue for the Mexican state of Baja California. The Mexicali tourism board makes the trip even easier, offering round-trip van service to medical tourism patients as north as Las Vegas for just $30.\n\n\u201cMedical tourism patients traveling from the United States to Baja California will find an exclusive lane for health consumers to cross into Tijuana and Mexicali that speeds up the process to and from,\u201d he said.\n\nBig Spenders\n\nStephano said medical tourism patients from the United States \u2013 a large segment of whom are Latino \u2014 are also attracted to Mexico for inexpensive medications and cosmetic surgeries including liposuction, Botox applications and gastric banding as well as spa services at Rancho La Puerta, considered among the world\u2019s best health resorts.\n\n\u201cAt a time when hospitals are concerned about controlling healthcare costs, medical tourism not only expands access to patients across the globe, but can deliver revenue beyond the price of a procedure or treatment,\u201d she said. \u201cMedical tourism patients don\u2019t typically travel alone. That means, in addition to the price of care, local economies stem to gain from money spent on travel and lodging accommodations, dining, and recreation.\u201d\n\nPatrick Jankowski, an economist at the Greater Houston Partnership, figures that for every $1 a medical tourism patient spends on healthcare through the Texas Medical Center, at least another $2 will benefit the local economy by generating commerce and jobs.\n\nAlmost three months had passed since he left Mexico for kidney transplant surgery at Texas Medical Center, and Juan Payan and his wife were in still in Houston. He is among 3,000 international patients who seek treatments at Houston Methodist annually. Half pay cash; some are insured and the remainder carry embassy or employer-sponsored coverage.\n\n\u201cHealth doesn\u2019t have a price,\u201d said Payan.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Medical tourism across the U.S.-Mexico border means revenue to local economies from Houston, Texas to Mexicali and Tijuana in the state of Baja California.", "og": {"url": "http://www.medicaltourismmag.com/blog/2014/09/ask-patient-medical-tourism-consumers-know-health-worth-price/", "site_name": "Medical Tourism Magazine | Blog", "image": "http://www.medicaltourismmag.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/border.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Ask a Patient: Medical Tourism Consumers Know Health Is Worth Price"}, "twitter": {"description": "Medical tourism across the U.S.-Mexico border means revenue to local economies from Houston, Texas to Mexicali and Tijuana in the state of Baja California.", "creator": "@Medtour", "image": "http://www.medicaltourismmag.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/border.jpg", "title": "Ask a Patient: Medical Tourism Consumers Know Health Is Worth Price", "site": "@MedTourMagazine", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 578485882245508}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdacfb\"", "article_summary": "About 20,000 medical tourism patients like Payan travel to Houston each year from international destinations for medical care.\nThe Mexicali tourism board makes the trip even easier, offering round-trip van service to medical tourism patients as north as Las Vegas for just $30.\n\u201cForeign revenue from medical tourism patients coming to Baja California annually reaches $89 million,\u201d said Juan Benjamin Tintos Funcke, Secretary of Tourism for Baja California.\nTexas Medical Center is swimming in a pool of competing nations who are looking to entice somewhat wealthy international patients looking to jump into medical tourism.\n\u201cMedical tourism patients don\u2019t typically travel alone."}
