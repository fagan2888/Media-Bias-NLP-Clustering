The student-research topics were approved by faculty advisors at the beginning of the spring semester.\n\nMisericordia University features the oldest nursing program in the region and graduates more students in the health sciences than any other college or university in Northeastern Pennsylvania. The University offers three undergraduate nursing programs: traditional, full-time nursing students; part-time accelerated evening program for adult students, and the RN-to-BSN Expressway Program. The undergraduate nursing programs are designed to meet the special educational and scheduling needs of adult and traditional students, and lead to the Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) degree.\n\nThe Department of Nursing at Misericordia University also offers the online Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) degree program \u2013 the third doctoral program at the University \u2013 to accommodate the needs of busy health care professionals and in response to the growing national need for advanced practice nursing professionals.\n\nThe MSN nursing program is designed to meet the special needs of current BSN registered nurses who desire an advanced practice specialization as a family nurse practitioner. MU also offers a post-master's certificate as a family nurse practitioner for nurses who already have an advanced clinical master's degree and who wish to change or expand their practice focus to primary care. Nurse practitioners are registered nurses with advanced education in health assessment, diagnosis and management of acute and chronic health conditions with expertise in health promotion and disease prevention. Graduate programming leads to the MSN and provides course work in a convenient part-time, one-day-a-week format.\n\nNursing students at Misericordia can successfully complete the three individual programs \u2013 BSN, MSN and DNP \u2013 by taking a blend of traditional classroom and online courses.\n\nThe nursing program recently had its continuing accreditation extended for the maximum of 10 years to March 2023 by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE).\n\nFor more information about the Department of Nursing at Misericordia University, please call (570) 674-6400 or log on to www.misericordia.edu/nursing.
