It occurs all along the food chain. But each of us can do our part, and solving it can help alleviate other problems such as hunger and environmental destruction.\n\nThis fall, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack and other federal officials announced the nation\u2019s first national food loss and waste goal, calling for a 50 percent reduction by 2030. The numbers are staggering. The USDA says 30-40 percent of the food supply is wasted, the equivalent of 1,249 calories per American per day.\n\nThe impact is huge. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that 21 percent of all municipal solid waste is food. The cost includes the wasted water, soil, gasoline and other resources used to grow, ship and store that food. And rotting food produces methane, a greenhouse gas.\n\nThe USDA and the EPA are recruiting farms, food manufacturers, grocery stores, restaurants, schools, local governments and others to join the effort to reduce, recover and recycle food. The EPA is offering organizations technical assistance to help them achieve food waste goals and incentives to donate food to the needy.\n\nSuch efforts are laudable, but really solving the problem will require something as monumental as Norman Borlaug\u2019s Green Revolution, which boosted wheat yields and saved Asian nations from widespread famine.\n\nThe problem is different now. Per Pinstrup-Andersen, a former World Food Prize laureate, notes that many developing nations have surpluses of grain. The problem often occurs in getting that grain from farm to market to mouths.\n\nYet efforts at solving global hunger continue to focus first on producing more. The priority should be on wasting less.\n\nExperts have proposed several recommendations to cut food waste, including:\n\nDoing audits to identify where the losses and waste are happening in the food chain.\n\nInvesting in on-farm storage and other infrastructure.\n\nIncreasing tax deductions for farmers or processors to encourage them to donate food to the needy.\n\nEliminating confusing labels. Many \u201csell by\u201d and \u201cbest by\u201d dates are guidelines. Some are aimed at retailers, some at consumers, and they aren't necessarily connected to food safety. Retailers could sell products approaching date limits at a discount, instead of throwing them out.\n\nChanging consumer behavior. Retailers encourage waste through practices such as 2-for-1 discounts or bulk discounts, which entices consumers to buy more than they can use. Retailers and consumers can also embrace the ugly apple \u2014 or at least less-than-perfect-looking produce.\n\nClearly, the answer requires more than just being creative with leftover turkey and stuffing. But that\u2019s a great, and delicious, way to start.\n\nHOW TO REDUCE WASTE\n\nFighting food waste is an old battle for some generations. The USDA launched food-waste campaigns during World War I and II, and some of the advice still applies: \u201cserve just enough, save what will keep.\u201d The agency has also adopted new tools, including a smartphone app called FoodKeeper that offers cooking and storage tips, sends expiration reminders, and a 24/7 virtual expert to answer questions. Food Tank, a think tank that focuses on the food system, has compiled a list of 13 other apps that connect farmers, retailers, consumers and donors to reduce food waste.\n\nHere are other tips from the EPA on reducing food waste:\n\nShop your refrigerator first. Cook or eat what you already have at home before buying more.\n\nPlan your menu before you go shopping and buy only those things on your menu.\n\nBuy only what you realistically need and will use. Buying in bulk only saves money if you are able to use the food before it spoils.\n\nBe creative. If safe and healthy, use the edible parts of food that you normally do not eat. For example, stale bread can be used to make croutons and beet tops can be saut\u00e8ed for a side dish.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/1HlvTwa", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Addressing food waste can help alleviate problems such as hunger, environmental destruction", "p": {"domain_verify": "372c291dc2b106308d26264f4fba3b10"}, "og": {"site_name": "Des Moines Register", "description": "Addressing food waste can help alleviate problems such as hunger, environmental destruction", "title": "Editorial: Waste not, want not this Thanksgiving", "url": "http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/opinion/editorials/2015/11/24/editorial-waste-not-want-not-thanksgiving/76330134/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/desmoinesregister.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Addressing food waste can help alleviate problems such as hunger, environmental destruction", "title": "Editorial: Waste not, want not this Thanksgiving", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b7f708985f77c50e3f101b4202cee963e7af0b3a/c=712-0-3544-2832&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/11/23/IAGroup/DesMoines/635838739915180097-Davitt-DSC-4201.JPG", "creator": "@DMRegister", "site": "@DMRegister", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600025120", "fb": {"app_id": 169766623060429}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Events/Thanksgiving", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Events/Thanksgiving", "title": "Editorial: Waste not, want not this Thanksgiving", "author": "The Register's editorial", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion/editorials", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ab3247e54f417f88f889107d4e536ce8e44c74d7/c=1066-0-3190-2832/local/-/media/2015/11/23/IAGroup/DesMoines/635838739915180097-Davitt-DSC-4201.JPG", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ffcf9ffae20ad5cc11182249bf77aaa4aba103f0/c=712-0-3544-2832/local/-/media/2015/11/23/IAGroup/DesMoines/635838739915180097-Davitt-DSC-4201.JPG", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/56627f5e9790c71fbe5f3c7e33c8fb66dc81124b/c=245-0-4012-2832/local/-/media/2015/11/23/IAGroup/DesMoines/635838739915180097-Davitt-DSC-4201.JPG", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/be9a90f511f325969b579fab35ea532686ad5a55/c=0-214-4256-2619&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2015/11/23/IAGroup/DesMoines/635838739915180097-Davitt-DSC-4201.JPG", "publishtime": "2015-11-24T21:16:32.023000-06:00", "shorthed": "Editorial: Waste not, want not", "articleid": 76330134, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/42cb2ab39386d022d7e20e94b6878b14f637e89c/c=0-214-4256-2619/local/-/media/2015/11/23/IAGroup/DesMoines/635838739915180097-Davitt-DSC-4201.JPG", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f9dc7bd51c876aa99555a87f39d35a781fd5d73a/c=1335-0-2921-2832/local/-/media/2015/11/23/IAGroup/DesMoines/635838739915180097-Davitt-DSC-4201.JPG"}}}, "article_summary": "Experts have proposed several recommendations to cut food waste, including:Doing audits to identify where the losses and waste are happening in the food chain.\nThe EPA is offering organizations technical assistance to help them achieve food waste goals and incentives to donate food to the needy.\nHOW TO REDUCE WASTEFighting food waste is an old battle for some generations.\nFood waste is a global problem.\nFood Tank, a think tank that focuses on the food system, has compiled a list of 13 other apps that connect farmers, retailers, consumers and donors to reduce food waste."}
