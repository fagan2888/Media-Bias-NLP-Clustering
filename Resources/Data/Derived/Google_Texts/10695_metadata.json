The White House, meanwhile, is countering that the healthcare legislation was not only approved by both houses of Congress, and validated by the Supreme Court, but also was authenticated by his election triumph \u2014 after a campaign in which his opponent made hostility to the healthcare reform law his main point of attack.\n\n\u201cPresidential mandate\u201d is an ideal brickbat in a political struggle because it is so carelessly used. Republicans who question Obama\u2019s credentials today were quick to claim after the 2004 presidential election that, in then-Vice President Dick Cheney\u2019s words, \u201cthe nation responded by giving [Bush] a mandate.\u201d They ignore the reality that Obama gained re-election by a larger percentage of the popular vote than George W. Bush had received, and that his advantage in the Electoral College was 126 votes in contrast to Bush\u2019s 35.\n\nJournalists have further muddied the waters. After Bush\u2019s 2004 re-election win, for example, an NPR reporter stated, \u201cBy any definition, I think you could call this a mandate.\u201d Following Obama\u2019s victory in 2012, however, NPR headed its website: \u201cFor Obama, Vindication, But Not a Mandate.\u201d So debased has \u201cpresidential mandate\u201d been in the currency of discourse that exasperated scholars are recommending that the expression be jettisoned.\n\nBut to abandon the idea of mandate altogether is to conclude that, in a democracy, American citizens can never express their will effectively and to ignore those times when they did so. In the 20th century, there is no clearer instance than the 1932 election, which ushered in President Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s electrifying First Hundred Days of the spring of 1933 and the birth of the New Deal.\n\nInstead of embarking on a fruitless quest for a precise definition of mandate, it is more rewarding to explore what a real mandate looks like.\n\nBe forewarned that there is never perfect congruence between ballots cast and subsequent presidential behavior. In every contest, some voters are more interested in personality than policy, and others merely register traditional party identification. Moreover, in 1932 the Republican incumbent, President Herbert Hoover, was so strongly disliked that the Democratic challenger, Roosevelt, who knew that he was running well ahead, thought it ill-advised to risk articulating controversial positions.\n\nOn a couple of occasions \u2014 notably at Forbes Field, home of the Pittsburgh Pirates \u2014 he even voiced a conservative message. (When Roosevelt was set to return to Forbes Field in the 1936 campaign, he instructed his speech writer, Samuel Rosenman, to prepare a draft claiming that massive New Deal spending was consistent with his 1932 emphasis on frugality when he was last at the ballpark. Rosenman came back later that day with a facetious answer: \u201cMr. President, the only thing that you can say about that 1932 speech is to deny categorically that you ever made it.\u201d)\n\nFor the most part, however, FDR offered the electorate a clear choice in 1932 by announcing that he intended to be a transformational president. \u201cThe country needs, and, unless I mistake its temper, the country demands bold, persistent experimentation,\u201d Roosevelt declared at Oglethorpe University in Georgia. In Albany Roosevelt, who as governor of New York had created the first comprehensive system of unemployment relief, urged Americans to focus their attention on \u201cthe forgotten man at the bottom of the economic pyramid.\u201d\n\nRoosevelt was the first candidate in American history to deliver an acceptance address at a party convention. He flew through squalls to Chicago in a tri-motored plane, twice having to land for refueling. When he appeared before the cheering delegates, he said: \u201cI have started out on the tasks that lie ahead by breaking the absurd tradition that the candidate should remain in professed ignorance of what has happened for weeks until he is formally notified.\u2026 You have nominated me and I know it, and I am here to thank you for the honor. Let it \u2026 be symbolic that in so doing I broke traditions. Let it be from now on the task of our party to break foolish traditions.\u2026 I pledge you, I pledge myself to a New Deal for the American people.\u201d\n\nIn a campaign whose outcome may legitimately be regarded as yielding a mandate, it is important, too, for the opponent to demarcate major disagreement. That Hoover surely did.\n\n\u201cThis election is not a mere shift from the ins to the outs,\u201d Hoover asserted. \u201cIt means deciding the direction our nation will take over a century to come.\u201d Roosevelt, he maintained, had embraced \u201cthe same philosophy of government which has poisoned all Europe\u201d and was spouting \u201cthe fumes of the witch\u2019s cauldron which boiled in Russia.\u201d\n\nIn November 1932, the nation left no doubt about its verdict. In ousting Hoover, Roosevelt became the first Democrat to enter the White House with a popular majority (50 percent or more of the ballots) in 80 years \u2014 not since Franklin Pierce in 1852.\n\nHoover received the pitiful proportion of less than 40 percent of the popular vote. FDR swept every state south and west of Pennsylvania. He ended the long period of Republican predominance and began the creation of \u201cthe FDR coalition\u201d whose influence persists, though in muted fashion, in the 21st century.\n\nAfter taking office in 1933, Roosevelt sent 15 legislative requests up to the Hill. Congress, registering the mandate, passed all 15 \u2014 with numbers of Republicans crossing party lines to support him.\n\nHow is the 1932 precedent pertinent today? Clearly, Obama\u2019s victory margin fell considerably short of FDR\u2019s \u2014 and Democrats ought to be circumspect about claiming too great a mandate. But before this year, no one has ever suggested that, unless an election triumph is of huge dimensions, a president is proscribed from enforcing a law enacted by a previous Congress.\n\nAt times, the rhetoric of a negative mandate finds a place in the theater of the absurd. In 2012, GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney\u2019s web video underscored his intent in a terse slogan: \u201cDay one. Job one. Repeal Obamacare.\u201d\n\nYet Republicans, after being soundly beaten a year ago, maintain that, in shutting down the U.S. government unless the president puts healthcare in abeyance, they are being faithful to the popular will. To take that claim seriously would be to strip the conception of \u201cmandate\u201d of all meaning and to render it a farce.\n\nPHOTO (Top): President Barack Obama waves to a crowd as he arrives for a campaign rally in Madison, Wisconsin, October 4, 2012.
