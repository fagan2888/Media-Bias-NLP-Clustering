Morgan Griffith, R-Salem, in the fall elections.\n\n\u201cMy motivation is personal. This area is my home,\u201d Kitts, 47, said as he addressed the convention and its 147 delegates.\n\nThe district needs a hard-charging representative who\u2019ll \u201cstand and fight toe-to-toe\u201d to advance its interests, he said.\n\n\u201cWe have resources here the rest of the state can\u2019t even imagine,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re second to none. That needs to be represented.\u201d\n\nKitts, who recently retired after 24 years in the U.S. Army, beat out Bill Bunch of Tazewell County for the Democratic nomination.\n\nParty members said it marked the first time the 9th District Democratic Committee has had a contested race for the congressional slot since 1982. That was the year former Rep. Rick Boucher first won the nomination.\n\nBunch, a farmer and retired postal worker, is an ardent backer of Bernie Sanders and his campaign platform mirrored that of the Vermont senator\u2019s.\n\nHe and Kitts spoke well of each other throughout the campaign, and he quickly threw his support to Kitts after Saturday\u2019s vote.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud of the race that we ran,\u201d Bunch said. \u201cMy opponent is an excellent candidate, and we\u2019ll be working very hard for him without any reservation.\u201d\n\nKitts, a self-described Blue Dog Democrat, has called for a new Appalachian infrastructure push to expand cellphone and internet connectivity in Southwest Virginia and neighboring regions.\n\nHe\u2019s supported the Affordable Care Act as a starting point for change, but said amendments are needed to achieve things like lower prescription prices.\n\nOn guns, he\u2019s described himself as a strong supporter of the Second Amendment. He\u2019s backed universal background checks but opposes limiting magazine sizes or assault-style weapons.\n\nKitts\u2019 supporters stressed his service record and approach to leadership during introductory remarks at the district convention. Kitts did four combat tours while in the Army \u2014 three in Iraq and another in Afghanistan. He was awarded two Bronze Stars.\n\nIn his own remarks, Kitts said Southwest Virginia Democrats have been too quiet in recent years and urged them to raise their voices to drown out \u201cthe trumpets\u201d in the political world.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need to be quiet,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to be ashamed of what we do and what we stand for. \u2026 We talk about health care, we talk about jobs, we talk about infrastructure. But we don\u2019t talk loud enough and we don\u2019t do it strong enough as a party. These are voices we need to push forward.\u201d\n\nKitts and other speakers criticized Griffith at times, describing him as detached leader who hasn\u2019t represented the district well.\n\n\u201cIf you see me get wound up, if you see me get angry, my anger is directed at one person and one thing and that\u2019s the current representative we have in this area who doesn\u2019t represent who we are,\u201d Kitts said.\n\nGriffith, reached for comment Saturday afternoon, said he\u2019s looking forward to the election and \u201ctaking my conservative message out to the 9th District of Virginia.\u201d\n\nHe added he doesn\u2019t know Kitts well yet, but said Democratic Party leaders are out of sync with the district.\n\n\u201cI think the voters of the 9th District understand that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton don\u2019t have the answers they\u2019re looking for,\u201d he said.\n\nThe general election is Nov. 8. Democrats last fielded a challenger against Griffith in 2012. He won that race with 61 percent of the vote.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "www.roanoke.com", "description": "WYTHEVILLE \u2014 Democrats in the Fightin\u2019 Ninth have picked a military veteran to carry their banner in this year\u2019s congressional races.", "title": "Derek Kitts chosen as Democratic opponent against Griffith in 9th District", "url": "http://www.roanoke.com/news/politics/derek-kitts-chosen-as-democratic-opponent-against-griffith-in-th/article_46956dfa-3ac1-55ed-bc55-0c680eeb0ac4.html", "image": {"width": 421, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/roanoke.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/8/c8/8c85dda0-ad32-51d8-896f-dea776f3660c/57410c5045178.image.jpg?resize=421%2C630", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@roanoketimes", "card": "summary", "creator": "@"}, "description": "WYTHEVILLE \u2014 Democrats in the Fightin\u2019 Ninth have picked a military veteran to carry their banner in this year\u2019s congressional races.", "fb": {"app_id": 251357365028982}, "keywords": "derek kitts,democrats,morgan griffith,bill bunch,nomination,supporter,district,politics,politics", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/roanoketimes"}, "news_keywords": "derek kitts,democrats,morgan griffith,bill bunch,nomination,supporter,district,politics,politics"}, "article_summary": "Derek Kitts, a Purple Heart recipient from Christiansburg, won the 9th District party\u2019s nomination Saturday at a convention put on in Wytheville.\nParty members said it marked the first time the 9th District Democratic Committee has had a contested race for the congressional slot since 1982.\n\u201cI think the voters of the 9th District understand that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton don\u2019t have the answers they\u2019re looking for,\u201d he said.\nBut we don\u2019t talk loud enough and we don\u2019t do it strong enough as a party.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need to be ashamed of what we do and what we stand for."}
