I wouldn\u2019t know how to plough. It is really hard,\u201d Bunlim, 62, told AFP while repairing his broken net.\n\nModern life has not passed them by completely \u2014 nowadays many people have stereo systems, televisions and small motorboats.\n\nBut they still mostly depend on fishing or rowing around the village in canoes to sell food to earn a living.\n\nThe Tonle Sap is a source of sustenance and survival for more than one million people living on or around the lake, which has at least 149 species of fish, the Mekong River Commission says.\n\nIt transforms between the dry and wet seasons, with the inundated area growing from about 3,500 square kilometers at its smallest to 14,500 square kilometers at the height of the floods, according to the MRC, a regional intergovernmental body.\n\nThe lake\u2019s minimum depth rises from about half a meter in April to as much as nine meters in September and October.\n\nSo people living on the lake have to be ready go with the flow \u2014 quite literally \u2014 by allowing their homes to float.\n\nYet as fish stocks start to disappear, so too are the residents of the lake-top villages.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t catch enough fish,\u201d said fisherman Yorng Sarath, 25.\n\n\u201cIf the wind is calm, I can catch around 11 pounds of fish a day. When there is strong wind I can only catch around one kilo, and then I have to come back as I can\u2019t lay out my net. I can\u2019t earn enough money to last me all day.\u201d\n\nThe father of two said that once he has saved enough money he plans to move to dry land to find work.\n\n\u2018Young people prefer land\u2019\n\nLife on the lake does move with the tides of time but many modern luxuries are hard to come by, and for young people dry land can hold greater appeal.\n\nRoughly 400 families \u2014 a fifth of the population \u2014 have left Chhnork Trou over the last couple of years in search of a better life on land, according to community leader Samrith Pheng.\n\n\u201cIn the past there were a lot of fish so people wanted to live here. Now the fish stock is going down they can\u2019t depend on the fishing,\u201d Pheng said.\n\n\u201cThe young generations such as my children and grandchildren don\u2019t want to live in the floating villages anymore,\u201d he added.\n\nThe lake yields about 200,000 to 218,000 tons of fish a year \u2014 nearly half of the total annual catch of inland fish for the whole of Cambodia, according to a 2006 estimate cited by the MRC.\n\nMore recent figures, as well as estimates of how much fish stocks have fallen, are hard to come by and much of the evidence is anecdotal.\n\nConservationists warn that human population growth, habitat destruction and upstream dams are also threats to the lake\u2019s fisheries and wildlife.\n\nIn an attempt to prevent further depletion of stocks, the government in 2012 banned large-scale commercial fishing in the lake in a victory for local communities.\n\n\u201cWe are working hard to improve fish stocks,\u201d said Nao Thourk, head of the Cambodian government\u2019s fisheries department, who estimates that about 1.5 million people fish on the Tonle Sap.\n\nBut illegal fishing \u2014 sometimes using electrocution \u2014 remains a major cause for concern.\n\n\u201cIf we look at the magnitude of the fishing offences today, we don\u2019t expect fish stocks to increase,\u201d said Om Sovath, executive director of the Fisheries Action Coalition Team, which promotes sustainable resource management.\n\nThe exact number of people living in the floating houses on the lake is unknown, but officials and activists say tens of thousands of families call the bobbing villages home.\n\nYet beyond fishing or running a shop, job prospects are scarce, and with growing demands for a good education and better opportunities, the traditional way of life could become a thing of the past.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t say what the future holds for this floating community,\u201d said fisherman Bunlim.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Cambodia\u2019s floating villages are sailing toward trouble", "title": "Cambodia\u2019s floating villages are sailing toward trouble", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/03/01/cambodias-floating-villages-are-sailing-toward-trouble/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140301__p_11dd057a-37ba-4763-8afb-b4d89c23e617lsoriginalph.jpg", "height": 426}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140301__p_11dd057a-37ba-4763-8afb-b4d89c23e617lsoriginalph.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-01T12:53:54+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T18:46:53+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Yet as fish stocks start to disappear, so too are the residents of the lake-top villages.\n\u201cThe young generations such as my children and grandchildren don\u2019t want to live in the floating villages anymore,\u201d he added.\nMore recent figures, as well as estimates of how much fish stocks have fallen, are hard to come by and much of the evidence is anecdotal.\nThe exact number of people living in the floating houses on the lake is unknown, but officials and activists say tens of thousands of families call the bobbing villages home.\n\u201cI can\u2019t say what the future holds for this floating community,\u201d said fisherman Bunlim."}
