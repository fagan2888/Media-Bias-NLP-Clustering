Maybe HealthCare.gov will be up and running smoothly for \u201cthe vast majority\u201d of Americans, give or take 80 percent, by the end of this month. That\u2019s the deadline President Barack Obama set and that Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius promised to meet.\n\nMaybe enrollment will pick up, and the administration will meet its goal of 7 million Americans insured through the Obamacare exchanges. It could happen, but will it change things? That\u2019s the whistling-past-the-graveyard question.\n\nNational Journal\u2019s James Oliphant says it won\u2019t matter:\n\nBut there is a more fundamental reason why the president is going to have a tough time bouncing back from this: to most Americans, Obamacare remains an abstraction. The direct benefits of the law are imparted to a relatively tiny part of the population. Only 12 million Americans are expected to use federal and state insurance exchanges to purchase coverage \u2013 that\u2019s about 4 percent of the total population of the country. And it\u2019s possible many of them have already received cancellation notices along with notices of rate hikes, which means their attitudes toward the ACA are, for want of a better word, complex. At the same time, about 13 million Americans are expected to benefit from the expansion of the Medicaid program. Add those two cohorts together and you end up with about 25 million who receive a direct, substantive benefit from the ACA. That\u2019s less than 10 percent of the population and compared to those who benefit from Medicare (49 million) and Social Security (62 million), or even Medicare Part D (36 million), a thin slice of the electorate. More significantly, just about every American will ultimately take advantage of those three entitlements; this is not true for the ACA. What it all means is that even if the Affordable Care Act works perfectly from Nov. 30 on out (and no one is seriously expecting that), those whose lives are improved by the program represent just a relative handful of people, many of whom sit at the lower end of the economic spectrum and engage little with the political process. As Geer says, \u201cThey tend not to vote.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s just part of the story. As broken promises go, keeping your plan or keeping your doctor are just the car wrecks of the moment. Another big one, you\u2019ll recall, was that Obamacare would save the average family $2,500 per year in health premiums.\n\nInstead, it\u2019s entirely possible that playing fast-and-loose with enrollment dates around the 2014 election will make no difference for Democrats, if Americans with employer-sponsored health plans suddenly find themselves out of luck or paying a lot more.\n\nAccording to projections the administration itself issued back in July 2010, it was clear officials knew the impact of ObamaCare three years ago. In fact, according to the Federal Register, its mid-range estimate was that by the end of 2014, 76 percent of small group plans would be cancelled, along with 55 percent of large employer plans. The reason behind the losses is that current plans don\u2019t meet the requirements of ObamaCare, which dictate that each plan must cover a list of essential benefits, whether people want them or not.\n\nConnecting the dots, whatever problems Obama and Obamacare have now, imagine the havoc in 2014 if administration projections prove accurate and, again, they knew this was coming. That might not be the best re-election strategy for Democrats struggling to hold the Senate.\n\nFollow @MikeHashimoto\n\n", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL2RhbGxhc21vcm5pbmd2aWV3c2Jsb2cuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxMy8xMS9jb3VsZC10aGUtd29yc3QtZnJvbS1vYmFtYWNhcmUtc3RpbGwtbGllLWluLXdhaXQuaHRtbC8=", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Mike Hashimoto", "og": {"site_name": "Opinion Blog", "description": "Perhaps House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi is right that the disastrous Obamacare rollout will prove but a fleeting memory by the time Americans cast votes in the 2014 midterms.
