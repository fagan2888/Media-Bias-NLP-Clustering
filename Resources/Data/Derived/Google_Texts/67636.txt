GIFs, those short animated images that were popular back in the days of dial-up modems have been making a big comeback.

In fact, the comeback is so big that even the White House has taken notice of the trend.

GIFs, which are made up of several frames of still images, tend to be silly with things like dancing dogs and yes, even jumping cats.

The White House has posted GIFs on its website in an effort to draw more adults to sign up for Obamacare at HealthCare.gov.

We've put a sampling of the GIFs from the White House in this brief. To see more - and President Obama's bracket - click here.
