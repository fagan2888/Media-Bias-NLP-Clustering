A 59-year-old woman was arrested Friday after police said she shot and wounded her estranged husband at their Scottsdale mansion.

Rhonda Cerny was booked into jail on charges of attempted first-degree murder, aggravated assault, burglary and first-degree criminal trespass.

The victim’s adult daughter, who was home at the time of the shooting, called 911.

When police arrived at the home at 9701 E. Happy Valley Rd., they found the victim with one gunshot wound to the chest. Scottsdale Police Department spokesman Kevin Watts said the man suffered serious injuries but was expected to make a full recovery.

Watts called the incident a case of domestic violence.

As the investigation proceeded, police said they learned the couple’s daughter dropped Cerny off at the home just after 2 p.m. Friday.

Cerny went inside alone and confronted her estranged husband with a small caliber handgun, Watts said. An argument erupted and gunfire was heard soon after. The daughter, still in the car, called 911 when she heard gunshots ring out.

“There is no evidence that indicates Cerny was justified in using deadly force in the exchange,” Watts said in a news release on Saturday.

Watts added the daughter was unaware of her mother’s intentions or that she was even carrying a gun. .

The names of the victim and daughter are being withheld.
