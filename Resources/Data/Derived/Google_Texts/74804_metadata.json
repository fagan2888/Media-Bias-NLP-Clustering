He thinks that Obama will use the EPA to push regulatory programs on farming and agriculture. Both Lehr and his interviewer were hopeful that since the whole healthcare disaster, people may be less trusting of the government\u2019s regulatory fist. We can only hope, and although Lehr is optimistic, he warns that agriculture should still prepare for fight.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that modern sentiments towards agriculture have changed; agriculture is no longer romanticized, but demonized- in a sense- by the environmental movement that started about 40 years ago. The environmentalists have had a very loud voice, and have \u201cwon\u201d in terms of popular thought on big agriculture. Lehr recommends that farmers start talking and educating their communities of the truth about agriculture. He suggests taking two hours a month to talk to non-farming people about the new and exciting things happening on the farm.\n\nAgriculture is moving at the speed of light; with new machinery technologies, growing technology, and farm science, there should be plenty to talk about! Agriculture needs to win back the minds of the public.\n\nLearn more by listening to the podcast in the player above.\n\n[Subscribe to the Heartland Daily Podcast for free at this link.]", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://blog.heartland.org/2013/12/heartland-daily-podcast-jay-lehr-on-agriculture-appreciation/", "site_name": "Somewhat Reasonable", "image": "http://blog.heartland.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/celebration_iowa_agriculture_art_award_winners_announced_1_634811040309976453.jpg", "type": "activity", "title": "Heartland Daily Podcast: Jay Lehr on Agriculture Appreciation"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf584\"", "article_summary": "The government has its hands in all sorts of industries, and Lehr believes the the agriculture industry is next.\n[Subscribe to the Heartland Daily Podcast for free at this link.]\nHeartland Institute Science Director Jay Lehr was a guest on Brownfield News Radio, after delivering a speech at the Iowa Farm Bureau annual meeting in Des Moines, Iowa.\nAgriculture is moving at the speed of light; with new machinery technologies, growing technology, and farm science, there should be plenty to talk about!\nWe can only hope, and although Lehr is optimistic, he warns that agriculture should still prepare for fight."}
