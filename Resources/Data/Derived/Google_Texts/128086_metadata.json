If claims come in lower than cost of the premiums, the company (not the third-party insurer) keeps the difference.\n\nCompanies need to purchase stop-loss reinsurance to guard against runaway claims \u2014 hence the risk \u2014 but they often come out ahead over traditional plans.\n\nThat's something that Fred Bunker, the chief operating officer of Eden II, found out when he switched to a self-insured plan from MagnaCare three years ago.\n\nUntil he switched Eden II's 650 employees to self-insurance, Bunker would routinely switch insurance companies in an effort to avoid double-digit premium increases.\n\n\"We decided to go into (self-insurance) in order to regain some control over our benefits costs and also to optimize services to our employees, in the most cost-effective way,\" Bunker said. \"(With self-insurance), a lot of the mystery is taken out of the process.\"\n\nBunker said there are other benefits as well.\n\n\"We knew a certain amount of our premiums (with traditional coverage) went into a reserve for potential problems, but we never had the ability to manage any of that,\" he said. \"We could not determine the cost of the various components of the program, so we couldn't make intelligent decisions about changing our program.\"\n\nLarger employers have long embraced self-insurance.\n\nMike Thompson, the New York metro health care practice leader for PricewaterhouseCoopers human resource services, said its surveys found 85 percent of companies with more than 1,000 employees were self-insured.\n\nThe change, he said, is coming with smaller companies.\n\nThompson said the number of companies with fewer than 500 employees that are choosing to self-insure jumped from 22 percent in 2012 to 31 percent in 2013.\n\n\"It is really in the midsize to small/midsized range that we are starting to see a pickup in self-insurance,\" he said.\n\nThe traditional health insurance companies have long provided employers with self-insurance plans, including Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey and Aetna. And they too are noticing an increase in business, even among employers with fewer than 50 employees.\n\n\"We are seeing more and more (employers) going to self-insurance,\" John Lawrence, the president of Aetna in New Jersey, said at a recent business conference in Somerset.\n\nCost is the biggest factor.\n\nBunker said in the first two years with MagnaCare, premiums were flat. They then grew about 8 percent last year \u2014 a figure his team estimated would have been in the double-digits with a traditional health insurance plan.\n\nThe company also saves because it pays lower premium taxes under the Affordable Care Act, since the self-insured plans purchase less insurance.\n\nBut Eden II must spend more time and money on administration issues as a self-insured employer. And it must maintain reserves to pay claims.\n\nBunker, however, feels it is worth it.\n\n\"Because we have control and complete visibility to all our reserves, we can take some prudent risks and utilize some of our reserves to keep the premium increases to a minimum,\" he said. \"If we find we are having a good year and we're blessed with relatively good health of our population and we're building reserves, we can always take the opportunity to reduce some of those reserves and maybe reduce our costs accordingly \u2014 which we wouldn't have the opportunity to do (under a fully-insured plan).\"\n\nAnother key advantage of self-insurance is that Eden II has access to aggregate data about the health of employees and their families. So the company is able to draw a connection between efforts to improve employee health and the cost of providing health coverage, Bunker said.\n\n\"We personally experience what our participants are going through in the real world. We can tell where the needs are for our employees and try to craft solutions,\" he said.\n\n\u201cBecause we have control and complete visibility to all our reserves, we can take some prudent risks and utilize some of our reserves to keep the premium increases to a minimum,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we find we are having a good year and we\u2019re blessed with relatively good health of our population and we\u2019re building reserves, we can always take the opportunity to reduce some of those reserves and maybe reduce our costs accordingly \u2014 which we wouldn\u2019t have the opportunity to do (under a fully-insured plan).\u201d\n\nAnother key advantage of self-insurance is that Eden II has access to aggregate data about the health of employees and their families.
