Green fields blanketed the area. There were no drive-thrus, no gyms and no massive grocery stores.\n\n\u201cThirty-fifth (Avenue) was the end of the world, just about,\u201d she said.\n\nThis was after World War II, one of the most prosperous periods in our history, and yet Greeley was still a farm community. One of Chenoweth\u2019s friends at the Greeley Senior Activity Center remembers working for extra money on the farms that dominated the landscape.\n\nNow retired, Chenoweth and her friends congregate at the senior center downtown. It\u2019s an amenity only a bigger Greeley can offer, but she misses that little farm town.\n\nThese people didn\u2019t see it coming. Northern Colorado\u2019s little farm town is growing into a sprawling metropolis.\n\nSince the 1970s, the population has doubled. Big-name stores and restaurants trickled in. Downtown festivals, bustling hotels and craft breweries replaced feedlots. City limits clawed their way west.\n\nEven though they appreciate the amenities their new, bigger city has to offer, when longtime residents reflect on the past few decades, they long for a home to which they can\u2019t return \u2014 the one that was taken over by the crowds of people, where it\u2019s harder to get around and harder to know your neighbor. Greeley is now a city of 100,000 people.\n\n\u201cI miss that small town,\u201d Gene Torres said.\n\nTorres has been in Greeley for 70 years. He\u2019s reminded of the population growth every day, even in his smallest tasks, such as a trip to the grocery store.\n\n\u201cIf I wanted to go to the store to buy a loaf of bread 50 years ago, I was in and out,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, there\u2019s more wait. It\u2019s just busier.\u201d\n\nIn addition to increased population, the biggest telltale sign of Greeley\u2019s urbanization is, perhaps, its population past 35th Avenue.\n\nAs Chenoweth said, in her day, there was nothing past 35th Avenue. Now it splits Greeley; about 40 percent of the population lives west of 35th Avenue, assistant city manager Becky Safarik said. Now a city like Greeley is almost a bunch of small towns, not just one. The city is a jigsaw puzzle of numerous little communities, she said, built around where someone\u2019s kids go to school.\n\nBut all the differences can be a boon to residents. Now they get to choose their community.\n\n\u201cYou have so many choices in this town,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can really find the part of town that fits your lifestyle.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s the Sunrise Park area, an old part of town that immigrants settled early in the town\u2019s history.\n\nGreeley\u2019s downtown features loft-style apartments over shops, restaurants mixed with college students up the street and a working class just to the east.\n\nSix historic areas near the university offer more of a neighborhood feel.\n\nThe west side presents a more traditional suburban lifestyle.\n\nGreeley may have lost some of the intimacy, but residents are now more accepting of each other.\n\nGene Torres\u2019 wife, Alice, spent the early part of her life in New Mexico. When she got here, Greeley had a problem she didn\u2019t see back home.\n\n\u201cThere was a lot of discrimination,\u201d she said. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t rent (a home) because when they saw our last name, they\u2019d say, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s been rented.\u2019 Then it would be in the paper for the next week.\u201d\n\nBut Gene Torres adds: \u201cGreeley has come a ways.\u201d\n\nPerhaps that\u2019s just a reflection of the times, but it also may be because of the diverse population a larger city encourages.\n\n\u201cWe have a bigger immigrant population,\u201d Safarik said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen the biggest growth in that sector.\u201d\n\nAnd then there are the benefits that are impossible to see.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad we don\u2019t have the cow smell anymore,\u201d longtime resident Alvina Bailey said.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Longtime residents reflect as Greeley hits 100K population", "title": "Longtime residents reflect as Greeley hits 100K population", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/09/07/longtime-residents-reflect-as-greeley-hits-100k-population/", "image": {"width": 511, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150907_085542_greeley.jpg", "height": 321}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150907_085542_greeley.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-07T20:28:45+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T18:24:54+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Census"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9490\"", "article_summary": "It\u2019s just busier.\u201dIn addition to increased population, the biggest telltale sign of Greeley\u2019s urbanization is, perhaps, its population past 35th Avenue.\nNow it splits Greeley; about 40 percent of the population lives west of 35th Avenue, assistant city manager Becky Safarik said.\nIt\u2019s an amenity only a bigger Greeley can offer, but she misses that little farm town.\nGREELEY \u2014 Francis Chenoweth remembers when there were no glossy strips of shops and restaurants dotting Greeley\u2019s west side.\nGreeley may have lost some of the intimacy, but residents are now more accepting of each other."}
