He is also interested in mental health reform and creating a comprehensive online curriculum for high school students throughout the state.\n\nWaltrip said he wants to reform the state\u2019s education system and he would accept federal funds to expand Medicaid as prescribed in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, more commonly known as Obamacare.\n\nThe race represents Waltrip\u2019s first foray into electoral politics. He is a graduate of the Virginia Military Institute and the Mississippi College of Law. He serves on the Virginia Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers board.
