A couple that went missing Friday morning has been found safe and reunited with their family.

Deputies said 75-year-old Jessica Clark and 81-year-old Bernard Clark left their home on N. 113th Avenue in Youngtown for their sonâ€™s home in Litchfield Park about 11:40 a.m. By 10:15 p.m., deputies had upgraded the missing persons report to a Silver Alert.

They were supposed to arrive about noon but never made it.

There was special concern because deputies said Bernard Clark has shown signs of dementia and has been getting progressively worse. Jessica Clark has diabetes.

The couple did not have a cellphone.
