She couldn’t even finish the interview.

Mary Landrieu faced Republican Congressman Bill Cassidy in a runoff election Saturday, and the odds are the three-term incumbent Democrat will lose to her Tea Party challenger — stats blog FiveThirtyEight pegged Landrieu’s chances of losing Saturday’s runoff at “99.8 percent.”

Still, Landrieu has kept campaigning up to the last minute — a campaign that included a truly bizarre Friday interview with New Orleans talk radio host Jeff Crouere on WGSO-AM.

A few highlights:

Landrieu admitted that she “knew that there were problems” with Obamacare but she voted for it anyway…

…and when Crouere said that the Affordable Care Act was President Barack Obama’s “signature legislation,” Landrieu started asking the host where he’d gone to high school, implying that he was illiterate.

When Crouere brought up voter fraud, Landrieu had this to say:

It is such an insult for you and your listeners to claim that black people in the state, or African-Americans, cannot cast votes honestly. It’s truly sickening.… You’re repeating it because it makes you just such a happy person.

Then she hung up.
