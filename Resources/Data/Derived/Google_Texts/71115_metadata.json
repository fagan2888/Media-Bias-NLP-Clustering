What has kept you here? My daughter moved to Longmont in early 2005. After I had completed extensive treatment for lung cancer, she asked me to move here as well so that I would be closer to family. I closed on my home in October 2006 and moved from the San Fernando Valley in Los Angeles.\n\nWhat do you foresee as the future for Longmont? I've dedicated my time in Longmont to public policy, advocacy and activism. It has been my central focus. I believe that my dedication has made a strong, positive contribution to the well-being of my community. In the fall of 2011, while serving as the chair of the Board of Environmental Affairs, I became aware that the oil and gas industry intended to drill and frack within our city limits. This highly toxic industrial process has no place near our homes, schools, places of employment, parks and recreation areas \u2014 including Union Reservoir, where the drilling and fracking was targeted. Ultimately, I organized Our Longmont to initiate a citizen-driven ban on fracking and disposal of its waste products and managed the campaign. The city charter amendment passed in November 2012 with a 60-40 margin. As long as we can prevent the industry from invading our marvelous community, Longmont's future remains very bright. Both the industry and Gov. Hickenlooper are suing to prevent our well-being and local control of our community. The case is now in the appellate court and the \"citizen intervenors\" have committed to see this absolutely necessary David vs. Goliath battle to the Colorado Supreme Court.\n\nDo you think younger generations are, in general, becoming less involved with their local governments? Actually, the contrary is true. The threat to our community from fracking for oil and gas has activated younger and younger people. Usually older, retired people assume leadership in local government issues. Younger individuals, especially families with children, recognized the severe threat to their health, safety and welfare, and galvanized to help pass the ban. Students in the area have also dedicated efforts to protect their future. Thriving communities require involvement of all ages and backgrounds. Longmont is well on its way to continued community engagement.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.timescall.com/community-review/ci_27741405/100-kaye-fissinger", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0318/20150318__29TC100_FISSINGER~1_300.jpg", "endDate": "2025-03-18T22:41:41-0600", "description": "Age:  70\nOccupation: Retired; president, Our Health Our Future Our Longmont\nHow many years have you been in the St.", "ag": {"canon": "LongmontTimes-Call:article:27741405:view"}, "startDate": "2015-03-29T01:00:00-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.timescall.com/community-review/ci_27741405/100-kaye-fissinger", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0318/20150318__29TC100_FISSINGER~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Age:  70\nOccupation: Retired; president, Our Health Our Future Our Longmont\nHow many years have you been in the St.", "title": "100: Kaye Fissinger"}, "twitter": {"domain": "timescall.com", "description": "Age:  70\nOccupation: Retired; president, Our Health Our Future Our Longmont\nHow many years have you been in the St.", "title": "100: Kaye Fissinger", "url": "http://www.timescall.com/community-review/ci_27741405/100-kaye-fissinger", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0318/20150318__29TC100_FISSINGER~1.jpg", "site": "@TimesCall", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-03-29T01:00:00-0600", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "sailthru.title": "100: Kaye Fissinger", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0318/20150318__29TC100_FISSINGER~1.jpg", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Community Review", "modificationDate": "2015-03-28T18:55:18-0600", "google-site-verification": "lLtD9ZooxmJUEEdRSCVzkO06t_hYKtyDqZF7EA3N2U0", "sailthru.site": "timescall.com", "pubDate": "2015-03-28T18:56:48-0600", "news_keywords": "longmont, colorado, community, review, weld, county, top 100, community review, longmont times call, longmont colorado"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdda7e\"", "article_summary": "Kaye FissingerAge: 70Occupation: Retired; president, Our Health Our Future Our LongmontHow many years have you been in the St. Vrain Valley?\nThe threat to our community from fracking for oil and gas has activated younger and younger people.\nAs long as we can prevent the industry from invading our marvelous community, Longmont's future remains very bright.\nI believe that my dedication has made a strong, positive contribution to the well-being of my community.\nHickenlooper are suing to prevent our well-being and local control of our community."}
