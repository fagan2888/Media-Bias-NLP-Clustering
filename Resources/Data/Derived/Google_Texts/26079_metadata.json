Thus far, the candidates have been asked to answer silly questions on fantasy sports betting, personal finances, their energy levels, and some even took a bold stand on the vital question of whether they would kill baby Hitler if they could travel back in time.\n\nTo date, there has not been a single question related to HIV or AIDS.\n\nDebate moderators are not the only ones at fault. Candidates have made it a point to dedicate their valuable mike time to tout prior accomplishments and make personal attacks when they could be talking about issues of critical importance \u2014 like how to prevent the disease that has already killed approximately 39 million people worldwide.\n\nEvery day, about 5,600 people worldwide contract HIV \u2014 more than 230 every hour. There are currently more than 1.2 million people living with the infection in the United States, and we can expect roughly an additional 50,000 new HIV infections next year. Even more unsettling than these statistics is the fact that we no longer have a conversation about finding a cure. Why is it that we let our call to arms fade away into barely a whisper?\n\nSuccessful activism and scientific advancements have brought us to an historic crossroads. HIV and AIDS is no longer a death sentence. New lifesaving medication strategies like PrEP and PEP are over 90 percent effective in preventing HIV in healthy individuals. But real challenges remain, from access to health care and accurate sexual health information, to emerging threats like the recent surge in heroin use. Despite our progress, almost one in eight people in the United States with HIV are unaware of their status.\n\nWe can\u2019t afford to let future generations forget how serious and devastating a disease this is. Any serious contender who claims to be the \u201cnext generation\u2019s\u201d candidate should have a thoughtful and purposeful strategy that expands access to prevention tools nationwide and seeks to end the HIV and AIDS epidemic.\n\nAnd this strategy should be shared with the world. The presidential debates may not be talking about HIV and AIDS, but we are.\n\nGay Men\u2019s Health Crisis is serving as the unofficial debate monitor this election cycle \u2014 asking the critical questions that no one has asked.\n\nAll 18 presidential candidates, Republicans and Democrats, have been invited to make their HIV and AIDS agendas clear and public by January 18 by filling out this election cycle\u2019s first HIV and AIDS questionnaire. This survey is not going to be used to endorse any candidate. The purpose of the survey is simple \u2014 to ensure that the public and all those affected by the epidemic understand every candidate\u2019s views on HIV and AIDS.\n\nSome questions center on broad health care issues that relate to HIV prevention and treatment, such as access to health care and pharmaceutical price gouging. Candidates are asked to state their position on federal protection from discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity in housing, the workplace, and other areas. They are also asked how they plan to improve upon the reach of Medicaid, Medicare, and the Affordable Care Act, an issue relevant to all Americans, especially those living with HIV and AIDS.\n\nOther survey questions hone in on precise policies such as funding for HIV education, prevention, and treatment research and programs, and HIV and gender-based violence. The survey presses candidates to explain their plans for the services and programs that, for millions, are vital to their overall health and well-being.\n\nThese might not be questions that produce the best sound bites or rile up the crowd. But they are questions that matter to millions of Americans affected by the epidemic, and hundreds of millions of people around the world.\n\nKELSEY LOUIE is the CEO of Gay Men's Health Crisis", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Gay Men's Health Crisis is demanding that candidates for president address HIV.", "og": {"image": "http://www.advocate.com/sites/advocate.com/files/2015/12/23/where-is-the-debate-on-hiv-and-aidsx750.jpg", "title": "Where Is the Debate on HIV and AIDS?", "type": "article", "updated_time": "2016-01-06T13:09:42-05:00"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Advocate", "fb": {"page_id": 19799718480, "app_id": 625763650825412, "pages": 6030918854}, "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-24T05:00:00-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-24T05:00:00-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "All 18 presidential candidates, Republicans and Democrats, have been invited to make their HIV and AIDS agendas clear and public by January 18 by filling out this election cycle\u2019s first HIV and AIDS questionnaire.\nWhere Is the Debate on HIV and AIDS?\nOther survey questions hone in on precise policies such as funding for HIV education, prevention, and treatment research and programs, and HIV and gender-based violence.\nSome questions center on broad health care issues that relate to HIV prevention and treatment, such as access to health care and pharmaceutical price gouging.\nTo date, there has not been a single question related to HIV or AIDS."}
