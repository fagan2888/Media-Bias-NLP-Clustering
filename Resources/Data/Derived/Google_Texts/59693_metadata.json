But as geneticist-turned-Buddhist monk MATTHIEU RICARD tells Jane Mulkerrins, the secret to true happiness goes deeper than worldly success\n\nHappiness, Buddhist monk Matthieu Ricard insists, is something we can all achieve to a greater degree with \u2018mind-training'\n\nWhile I may not have empirical evidence to back this up, I\u2019d wager that New York City is one of the most selfish places on earth.\n\nDominated by the buzz of Wall Street dollars, fuelled by the froth of the fashion industry, it\u2019s a city obsessed with the twin pillars of power and wealth, and populated largely by ambitious individualists.\n\nThere\u2019s a strong history of philanthropy among the one per cent, but naming a library after oneself is hardly an act of selfless charity.\n\nAnd yet, on a Monday evening in an elegant Manhattan museum, a well-heeled crowd of New Yorkers is giving a rock-star reception to a Tibetan Buddhist monk, who is here to preach on the transformative value of altruism.\n\nBrought up in Paris, Matthieu Ricard, 69, has been named \u2018the happiest man in the world\u2019, and is best known for his two bestselling books The Art of Meditation and Happiness: A Guide to Developing Life\u2019s Most Important Skill (Matthieu\u2019s share of the proceeds goes to funding hospitals and schools in Tibet).\n\nIn the latter, Matthieu presents the notion that our concept of happiness is flawed: true happiness is not a feeling of elation or euphoria; rather, it is \u2018a deep sense of flourishing that arises from an exceptionally healthy mind \u2013 contentment rather than the collection of good times\u2019.\n\nIn both books, he offers ways to train one\u2019s brain, suggesting that happiness \u2013 like meditation \u2013 can be learned.\n\n\u2018Meditation is not a mere relaxation method but a long-term cultivation of human qualities,\u2019 he says.\n\nIn spite of spending much of his time sequestered in a Himalayan hermitage, Matthieu \u2013 a former high-flying molecular geneticist and the son of a prominent French philosopher \u2013 has become an enormously influential figure internationally and a regular fixture at the World Economic Forum in Davos, where he leads masters of the financial universe in morning meditation.\n\n\u2018I sometimes feel sad when sadness is the appropriate response, for a disaster in Nepal... But sadness is not mutually exclusive with a genuine sense of flourishing,' said Matthieu (pictured with Jane Mulkerrins)\n\nHe is the right-hand man of the Dalai Lama and one of his two TED talks, on the habits of happiness, has been watched by more than five and a half million people.\n\nHis writings on happiness and meditation have also led to his weighty new tome Altruism, described in a review by The Wall Street Journal as \u2018a careful, detailed, hard-nosed assessment of what is needed both for individual happiness and for the welfare of the planet\u2019.\n\nIn an era defined by image, introspection and the selfie \u2013 which neatly sums up what Matthieu refers to as the \u2018narcissistic epidemic\u2019 \u2013 the notion of altruism might appear to have been abandoned by modern society.\n\nBut running to more than 850 pages, and bringing together economics, evolution and environmental challenges, as well as medicine and neuroscience, Matthieu\u2019s Altruism: The Power of Compassion to Change Yourself and The World is a positive, polemical call to arms.\n\n\u2018It is so rich, so diverse, and yes, so long, that it is best kept as an inspiring resource to be consulted over many years,\u2019 advises the WSJ.\n\nOn stage this evening, dressed in his red robes, Matthieu admits that he never intended to produce such a hefty read. And he certainly never planned to write a book about the environment.\n\n\u2018But in the end, it is simply a matter of altruism versus selfishness,\u2019 he says.\n\n\u2018If a rhinoceros ran into the room now, you would all run away,\u2019 he notes to the hugely attentive audience.\n\n\u2018But if I say that a rhinoceros might be coming in 30 years, no one will do anything.\u2019\n\nA few days after his talk, I meet Matthieu at the exclusive Manhattan townhouse where he is staying during his week-long visit to the city, a four-floored brownstone belonging to Andrea Soros Colombel, the philanthropist daughter of billionaire investor George, who has a charity that has supported Tibetan culture and people for more than 20 years. It feels incongruous to be meeting in a place of such wealth.\n\nA little later, when we leave the house together to take some photographs, Matthieu comments, with a chuckle, that the entrance vestibule is the size of his hermitage.\n\nAs he sinks into a large grey armchair in the top-floor lounge, I ask how he copes with the frenetic pace of his speaking schedule.\n\nThis week alone, he has given scores of presentations and talks to NGOs, at corporations including Google and alongside numerous luminaries such as Richard Gere and Arianna Huffington.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s temporary,\u2019 he smiles beatifically and shrugs. \u2018If it were a full-time job, I would quit.\u2019\n\nAt the Shechen Tennyi Dargyeling Monastery in Nepal, by contrast, he rises at 4am and meditates until daybreak.\n\n\u2018Then I take tea on the balcony, watching the birds on the mountains,\u2019 he says.\n\nAfter another meditation, he eats lunch and in the afternoon studies Tibetan texts.\n\n\u2018Or, in the past few years, I\u2019ve worked on my books.\u2019\n\nHe meditates again until sunset, says prayers, and goes to bed early.\n\nLater today, however, he will be making a diversion en route back to Nepal, flying to his native France for three weeks to visit his 92-year-old mother, herself now a Buddhist nun who lives in the Dordogne.\n\nThe Ricard family, it seems, are an impressive lot. Matthieu\u2019s elder sister spent her career working with mute children, but at 42 years old was diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s.\n\n\u2018She\u2019s incredibly courageous, never complains, but she\u2019s had a lot of suffering,\u2019 says Matthieu.\n\nFor his part, Matthieu is witty and quick to laugh; the word twinkly feels belittling to apply to one so spiritually enlightened, but he exudes a calm, composed but playful charisma.\n\nGrowing up in lofty circles in Paris \u2013 Matthieu\u2019s father Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Revel was a prominent philosopher and journalist and a former member of the French Resistance, while his mother Yahne le Toumelin was a painter \u2013 he was surrounded by artists and intellectuals. He first had lunch with the Russian composer Stravinsky aged just 16.\n\nWas it, I ask, a completely secular upbringing?\n\n\u2018Not completely,\u2019 says Matthieu. \u2018No religious practice, but from when I was about 14 my mother got into studying the Christian mystics.\n\n'Buddhism didn\u2019t have much to offer at the time because there were not many good translations.\u2019\n\nMatthieu is clearly fearsomely bright \u2013 though he wears it lightly \u2013 and speaks French, English and Tibetan fluently.\n\n\u2018I learned Greek, Latin and German, which I forgot. And I used to speak fluent Spanish when I was a kid, which I also forgot,\u2019 he says ruefully.\n\n\u2018I was printing books in Delhi, so I know everything about printing in Hindi, but I could not have a conversation in it,\u2019 he adds.\n\nHe is also an accomplished photographer, praised by the legendary Henri Cartier-Bresson, who said of his work, \u2018Matthieu\u2019s spiritual life and his camera are one, from which spring these images, fleeting and eternal.\u2019\n\nWhen Matthieu was 18, his parents separated (his father left his mother for the journalist Claude Sarraute), and Matthieu started studying to become a molecular biologist. But he felt that something was missing.\n\n\u2018I didn\u2019t know what. But it was some sort of aspiration. I could sense a potential, but I didn\u2019t know where to look,\u2019 he recalls, removing his round-rimmed glasses and cleaning them with a cloth he produces from the folds of his robes.\n\nInspired by films about Tibetan monks made by his friend Arnaud Desjardins, Matthieu decided the place to look was India, and in 1972, aged 26, he left Paris for Darjeeling to study under Kangyur Rinpoche, a Tibetan master in the Nyingma tradition, the most ancient school of Buddhism.\n\nHe remained in Darjeeling for seven years, during four of which he never left his hermitage \u2013 a small hut on stilts, facing the mountains, with no electricity or running water.\n\n\u2018It was the most peaceful, satisfying time of my life; I felt totally content,\u2019 he sighs.\n\nHis father, while not impressed by his son\u2019s decision to abandon his successful career for Buddhism, did not stand in his way. His mother, meanwhile, took a three-year retreat and followed her son into the faith.\n\nMatthieu still sees himself more as a scientist than a philosopher and believes that from a Buddhist perspective the contemplative or meditative tradition is a science of the mind.\n\nNeuroscientist Richard Davidson at the University of Wisconsin-Madison conducted experiments on experienced meditators, each of whom had completed up to 50,000 hours of meditation, first when their brains were in a neutral state and then while meditating on generating a state of \u2018unconditional loving kindness and compassion\u2019.\n\nThe results showed huge changes in brain activity between the two states, with Matthieu\u2019s results showing the greatest difference they had ever measured, leading to him to being dubbed the \u2018happiest man in the world\u2019. He, however, bats the title away.\n\n\u2018There is no scientific basis to it; there is no happiness centre in the brain,\u2019 he insists.\n\n\u2018What we did at Madison was testing the effects of compassion and meditation.\n\n'It is true that it was of unprecedented magnitude,\u2019 he concedes. \u2018But what do they know about seven billion people? They have not all been measured.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s not a terrible title,\u2019 he admits, \u2018but it sort of stuck like a piece of Scotch tape that you can\u2019t get rid of.\u2019\n\nBut happiness, he insists, is something we can all achieve to a greater degree with \u2018mind-training.\n\n'Not everyone will play the piano like Rachmaninoff, but if you spend three years practising for half an hour a day, you will definitely enjoy playing the piano,\u2019 he asserts.\n\n\u2018You may not be like Federer when you play tennis, but if you practise, you may fully enjoy playing tennis. Why not the same thing with human qualities? If you can become good at chess or music, why not at altruism and compassion?\u2019\n\nMatthieu Ricard\n\nJust two weeks of practising compassion meditation increases pro-social behaviour (showing kindness, volunteering, donating or cooperating) and reduces activity in the area of the brain associated with fear, he says.\n\nIn studies conducted with children, who took part in mindfulness and cooperation exercises three times a week, their pro-social behaviour increased exponentially. Such findings, Matthieu believes, prove the enormous potential meditation has to reduce discrimination and exclusion.\n\nAnd, as the book\u2019s bold title claims, Matthieu also believes that greater altruism and compassion can improve our world beyond the individual level, too \u2013 at a cultural and societal level.\n\n\u2018Aristotle was a great philosopher, but he was in favour of slavery,\u2019 he points out.\n\n\u2018Nobody is in favour of slavery any more. Did human beings change? No. Institutions changed.\n\n\u2018Culture is cumulative,\u2019 he believes. \u2018We don\u2019t have to re-examine every generation.\n\n'Whether slavery is wrong and we should abolish it, or whether women should have the right to vote \u2013 that is acquired in our culture.\u2019\n\nMatthieu likens it to \u2018two knives sharpening. Individuals change culture, culture changes the individuals \u2013 and the next generation will change it again,\u2019 he says.\n\nMatthieu\u2019s is a powerfully positive and inspirational message; does he ever feel unhappy, I wonder?\n\n\u2018No, I don\u2019t feel fundamentally unhappy,\u2019 he says. \u2018I sometimes feel sad when sadness is the appropriate response, for a disaster in Nepal or a massacre \u2013 how can you not feel sad?\n\n\u2018But sadness is not mutually exclusive with a genuine sense of flourishing, because it gives rise to compassion; it gives rise to the determination to do something,\u2019 he asserts.\n\nContrary though it may sound, \u2018happiness shouldn\u2019t always be pleasant,\u2019 he says.\n\nWhat about regrets, I ask. Does he harbour any of those?\n\n\u2018Regret?\u2019 he cries, motioning around the expensively decorated mansion.\n\n\u2018Every time I look at these things, I feel, wow, imagine the responsibility of taking care of this place.\n\n\u2018My teacher used to say if you have a horse, you have the suffering of having a horse. If you have a house, you have the suffering of having a house. So much trouble to fix the tap, the electricity\u2026\u2019 he chuckles.\n\nHas he ever regretted not having a family of his own?\n\n\u2018Absolutely no regret,\u2019 he says firmly. \u2018We have so many children in the monastery, and we have so many children in the school there.", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "news_keywords": "Happiness,Dalai,Lama,s,right,hand,man,reveals,key,contentment", "original-source": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/you/article-3331746/Happiness-Dalai-Lama-s-right-hand-man-reveals-key-contentment.html", "doc-class": "Living Document", "twitter": {"description": "He has been dubbed the most contented person on the planet.
