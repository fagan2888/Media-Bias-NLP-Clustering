A top Army official says the latest delay in opening the new hospital at Fort Riley is attributed to 357 safety issues.

Assistant Secretary of the Army Katherine Hammack told U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran in a letter obtained by The Associated Press that the problems were identified during pre-final inspections. They include things like fire doors not meeting code requirements.

The project was initially fast-tracked for completion in 2012 but has run into numerous delays.

Hammack assured the Kansas senator that the contractor is actively working with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to resolve the issues as early as possible.

Hospital commander Col. Risa Ware says staff is training in the facility and 90 percent of the furniture and equipment has arrived.
