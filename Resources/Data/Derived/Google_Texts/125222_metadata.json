A failing website is just the tip of the iceberg; less choice, higher premiums, and lost coverage will be the legacy of ObamaCare,\" Phillips said.\n\nAFP is partially funded by the billionaire industrialist Koch brothers, who have spent many millions of dollars to back conservative causes and candidates.", "article_metadata": {"description": "DENVER -- There are nearly 250,000 Coloradans whose health care policies have been or will be cancelled as a result of the Affordable...", "generator": "WordPress.com", "p": {"domain_verify": "5873d9988d745234e5abf9cff7ed939d"}, "og": {"site_name": "FOX31 Denver", "description": "DENVER \u2014  There are nearly 250,000 Coloradans whose health care policies have been or will be cancelled as a result of the Affordable\u2026", "title": "Nearly 250,000 Colorado healthcare plans cancelled under Obamacare", "url": "http://kdvr.com/2013/11/06/nearly-250000-colorado-healthcare-plans-cancelled-under-obamacare/", "image": {"width": 400, "identifier": "https://localtvkdvr.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/site.jpg", "height": 225}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://localtvkdvr.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/site.jpg?w=240", "site": "@kdvr", "card": "summary", "creator": "@kdvr"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CC50DB4C5614EA88B5CFA75E33AAB02", "msapplication-tooltip": "Denver, Colorado News, Weather, Sports and more", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=334627011", "fb": {"pages": 90018331599}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://kdvr.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/17e52d5bd05a36821dc7d1d5f90e105c?s=16", "application-name": "FOX31 Denver", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/fox31denver", "published_time": "2013-11-07T00:20:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-07T20:00:55+00:00", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/fox31denver"}, "keywords": "politics, rx for change", "google-site-verification": "AmrqnQj74ngNWI1vn6WwMZyy9IWy4ZqooGuxLtd7lIs", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca9ca\"", "article_summary": "\"If people are having contracts with their insurance plans, those insurance companies are going to adjust those plans based on market conditions,\" DeGette said.\nPlease enable Javascript to watch this videoDENVER -- There are nearly 250,000 Coloradans whose health care policies have been or will be cancelled as a result of the Affordable Care Act, the state's Dept.\n\"While some plans are being cancelled, Coloradoans have many new options for 2014, due to the strength and competitiveness of our health insurance market.\"\n\"Consumers who have questions about these letters or any questions about their health insurance policy should contact the Division,\" said Commissioner of Insurance Marguerite Salazar.\nSo far, just 3,408 Coloradans have purchased new insurance plans on the exchange; many more, 34,168 Coloradans, have enrolled in Medicaid since the program expanded under the law."}
