(Photo: Staff photo)Buy Photo\n\nA special 11-year-old had the opportunity to wish Pope Francis a happy birthday.\n\nBut it was the child, Gracie West of Freehold Township, whose wish came true in that face-to-face moment Dec. 17.\n\nGracie, who was diagnosed with stage 4 neuroblastoma in November 2013, met the Pope thanks to the Make-A-Wish Foundation, a nonprofit organization that grants the wishes of children with life-threatening illnesses.\n\nSo at a recent Pope\u2019s Papal Wednesday Audience at the Vatican, Gracie, who recently completed her 10th round of chemotherapy, was in attendance.\n\n\u201cI have very, very strong faith and it has helped me through tons of (my journey with cancer),\u201d said Gracie. \u201cWe would pray all the time, and it would be a huge deal to meet the Pope and I thought, \u2018I should do that, following my strong faith.\u2019He\u2019s like the closest person to God.\u201d\n\nThousands of people attended the Audience, Gracie said. She was able to sit with her 14-year-old brother, Joey West, in a section designated for meeting the Pope.\n\n\u201cThere were huge groups of different languages singing, and there were dancers \u2014 it was cool,\u201d Gracie said. The Pope also gave a short speech that centered around love and family.\n\n\u201cThe Pope is such a people\u2019s Pope,\u201d said Gracie. \u201cHe\u2019s so down to earth, and when we met him he was so loving and took us in like he was our family. He was very loving and very caring to every person he went around to.\u201d\n\nWhen it was Gracie\u2019s turn to meet the Pope, he held her hand, blessed her \u2014 and her rosary beads \u2014 and kissed her forehead. He also shook her brother\u2019s hand.\n\n\u201cYou could tell what he was saying by his facial expressions,\u201d she said. \u201cI was nervous and excited \u2014 it was like the moment stopped in time for a second. We all like, took it in.\u201d\n\nShe told Pope Francis \u201chappy birthday\u201d \u2014 it was his 78th.\n\nShe even gave him a birthday card \u201cwith these cool sparkles on it\u201d and attached a Polaroid photo of her and her brother. Gracie herself wrote him a huge, personal letter telling the Pope about her journey with cancer and how her faith has gotten her through it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s helped me through tons of things, we prayed,\u201d Gracie said. \u201cWe would do this petition \u2014 it was a 2,000 Hail Mary petition. That helped like crazy. I do believe that people have stepped in our path for a reason \u2014 I do believe I met the Pope for a special reason.\u201d\n\nSharon West, Gracie\u2019s mother, says the experience of her daughter meeting Pope Francis was indescribable. She admits when Make-A-Wish Foundation asked Gracie early in her diagnosis for her wish, she was unsure if meeting the Pope counted as an eligible one.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re so grateful to them for making it happen,\u201d said West. \u201cGracie does have very strong faith. We had been going to treatment for awhile. It\u2019s been over a year now \u2014 and she said, \u2018you know, I think I want to meet the Pope.\u2019 And I thought, \u2018OK, I don\u2019t know if we can wish for that.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut Gracie could \u2014 and she did.\n\nMake-A-Wish called her with a date to meet Pope Francis, and after coordinating it with her chemotherapy treatments, they made the trip. West Freehold School and Clifton T. Barkalow Middle School \u2014 Gracie\u2019s schools \u2014 partnered to give Gracie a pink luggage set, a crossbody bag, a camera, neck pillows and rosary beads to bring with her to Italy.\n\n\u201cIt really is such an amazing organization that they are able to do that,\u201d Sharon West says. \u201cIt truly makes a difference because, you know, you\u2019re going through all this and you know it\u2019s going to be maybe not the easiest thing and you\u2019re going to be in it for the long haul. So it was really great just to have this, such a positive experience in the middle of all this. It refuels you.\u201d\n\nGracie, Joey and their parents stayed in Italy a few more days \u2014 and she loved breathing in the country\u2019s architecture. Among several Italian landmarks, she saw the Shrine of Padre Pio in San Giovanni Rotondo and the Catacombs of Rome.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to leave Italy,\u201d Gracie says with a light in her eyes. \u201cJust looking around and walking down the street, there was just a random column that was thousands of years old. There is a lot of these artifacts that are just there.\u201d\n\nPeople can continue to follow Gracie and her journey \u2014 and help others in need \u2014 with the Cookie\u2019s Crumblers Foundation; the name is after Gracie\u2019s nickname, \u201cCookie.\u201d\n\nOriginally planned to help raise funds for Gracie\u2019s treatments and help her overcome cancer, it soon will expand to help other children do the same. A portion of donations will benefit pediatric cancer research.\n\n\u201cI want to help kids like me in the hospital,\u201d says Gracie, who dreams of being a pediatric surgeon when she grows up. \u201cThat\u2019s what I want to do. I want to help families out, and we want to help anybody that needs help.\u201d\n\nFor more information on Gracie and Cookie\u2019s Crumblers, visit www.cookiescrumblers.org.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://mycj.co/1IAymx3", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Gracie West of Freehold attended Pope Francis\u2019 Papal Wednesday Audience at the Vatican.", "og": {"site_name": "MY CENTRAL JERSEY", "description": "Gracie West of Freehold attended Pope Francis\u2019 Papal Wednesday Audience at the Vatican.", "title": "Cancer-stricken girl, 11, meets Pope, gets blessing", "url": "http://www.mycentraljersey.com/story/news/local/2015/01/10/cancer-stricken-girl-meets-pope-francis/21539753/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/mycentraljersey.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Gracie West of Freehold attended Pope Francis\u2019 Papal Wednesday Audience at the Vatican.", "title": "Cancer-stricken girl, 11, meets Pope, gets blessing", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8006264b16411dbc32f6f4f016c39e8e09433cb4/c=0-408-2448-2856&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Bridgewater/2015/01/09/B9315815341Z.1_20150109231541_000_GAB9KCU1F.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@MyCentralJersey", "site": "@MyCentralJersey", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=859380356", "fb": {"app_id": 177893718898560}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Pope Francis, Roman Catholics, faith, facing cancer, beating cancer, Italy"}, "article_summary": "(Photo: Staff photo)Buy PhotoA special 11-year-old had the opportunity to wish Pope Francis a happy birthday.\nMake-A-Wish called her with a date to meet Pope Francis, and after coordinating it with her chemotherapy treatments, they made the trip.\nBuy Photo Gracie West of Freehold Township holds a photo of her and Pope Francis in her home.\nWe all like, took it in.\u201dShe told Pope Francis \u201chappy birthday\u201d \u2014 it was his 78th.\nBut it was the child, Gracie West of Freehold Township, whose wish came true in that face-to-face moment Dec. 17."}
