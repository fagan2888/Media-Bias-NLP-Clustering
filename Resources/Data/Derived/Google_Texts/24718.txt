Cruz, noting his father being a pastor, explained that the United States needs to have a president who is a “consistent conservative” who will “fight and stand for religious liberty.”

“I would also note that the scripture tells us, ‘You shall know them by their fruits.’ We see lots of campaign conservatives. But if we’re going to win in 2016, we need a consistent conservative. Someone who has been a fiscal conservative, a social conservative, a national security conservative. There are real differences among the candidates on issues like amnesty, Obamacare, religious liberty, life and marriage and I have been proud to fight and stand for religious liberty, to stand against Planned Parenthood, to defend life for my entire career and I will be proud to continue to do so as president of the United States.”
