That\u2019s part of the reason why the number of patients in the United States in need of a healthy organ currently stands at more than 120,000, according to the National Kidney Foundation.\n\nIn the upcoming weeks, the American Society of Transplant Surgeons, in conjunction with the American Renal Society and the American Society for Transplantation, will release white papers calling for studies on compensation for organ donation, which the National Organ Transplant Act of 1984 outlaws.\n\nSince the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) carried out the law, the organ donation waitlist has increased by more than 1200 percent. Medical officials haven\u2019t been able to meet the increasing need for organs. As a result, more Americans have died in the process of waiting for an organ than in World Wars I and II, Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan, and Iraq combined.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to transplant organs, the United States unfortunately is not as progressive, liberal or free-market as Iran or Riyadh,\u201d Thomas A. Firey, senior fellow for the Maryland Public Policy Institutes, wrote in the Herald-Mail Media last month. \u201cAs a result, another 6,500 Americans will die this year because they didn\u2019t receive a transplant, and the waiting list will top 125,000 suffering souls. It\u2019s well past time to reform one of America\u2019s deadliest laws.\u201d\n\nLawmakers on both sides of the aisle worry that compensating organ donations would encourage poor people to sell their organs for a quick dollar. But Dr. Sigrid Fry-Revere, founder of Stop Organ Trafficking Now, told Medical Daily that failing to provide medical coverage for the practice has made it so that only a wealthy few can donate organs, which has exasperated the supply gap.\n\n\u201cIf we just covered people\u2019s funds to donate, it would increase the flow of donors significantly and this is not creating a market for organ donations,\u201d said Fry-Revere. \u201cA market is not the way to go\u2026but we have created a model where only the rich can donate.\u201d\n\nFry-Revere has some cause for concern. Donating organs can cost anywhere between $5,000 and $20,000 and six weeks out of work, which doesn\u2019t bode well for 90 percent of American households that wouldn\u2019t be able to shoulder those expenses without going into debt. Before the passage of the Affordable Care Act, volunteers often couldn\u2019t afford follow-up care because their insurers designated organ donation as a preexisting condition, despite studies showing that people could lead healthy lives after the procedure. That\u2019s part of the reason why only 30 percent of Americans sign up for organ donation.\n\nSupporters of organ donor compensation cite Iran\u2019s success in eliminating its kidney donation wait list with its legal organ market \u2014 funded by the government and local charities \u2014 that has been in existence since 1982. While different than what many Americans have expressed support for, Iran\u2019s efforts have compelled officials in Australia and Singapore to at least consider following suit.\n\nIn the United States, however, efforts to increase the organ supply in the last 40 years \u2014 including the creation of computer registries \u2014 have focused on the deceased and the consent of their families. Facebook has also recently allowed users to disclose their organ donation status on the social network as a means of compelling others to join the registry. But even the use of cadavers \u2014 which account for more than two out of three organ transplants \u2014 can\u2019t help close the increasing organ gap.\n\nIn recent years, a growing chorus of health care providers have argued that lawmakers should revisit the National Organ Transplant Act and create some kind of system that will protect organ donors from egregious medical costs. The American public seems to agree. According to a poll conducted by NPR and Thomson-Reuters Health in May, nearly 60 percent of respondents supported compensation in the form of credits for health care needs, while nearly half wanted tax credits. More than 80 percent also expressed support for the practice when it involved the transfer of kidneys, livers, and bone marrow.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear they\u2019re saying there is a difference,\u201d Dr. Ray Fabius, chief medical officer for Thomson Reuters\u2019 health unit, told NPR. \u201cAny living donor should be recognized, and it should be handled by insurance companies.\u201d\n\nFor a large portion of the American population, however, organ donation may not be a possibility, even if HHS puts methods of compensation in place. A recent study presented at the American Society of Nephrology found that preventable health conditions \u2014 including obesity, alcoholism, diabetes, skin cancer, high blood pressure, HIV, coronary artery disease \u2014 disqualifies a majority of Americans from donating.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "\"It\u2019s well past time to reform one of America\u2019s deadliest laws.\"", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "\"It\u2019s well past time to reform one of America\u2019s deadliest laws.\"", "title": "Why More Than 120,000 Americans Can\u2019t Get The Organ Transplant They Need", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/11/20/3595088/organ-transplant-issues/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/AP970108042205.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"It\u2019s well past time to reform one of America\u2019s deadliest laws.\"", "creator": "@SamPKCollins", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/AP970108042205-321x214.jpg", "title": "Why More Than 120,000 Americans Can\u2019t Get The Organ Transplant They Need", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/AP970108042205.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/AP970108042205.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-20T14:29:29+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/sampkcollinswriter"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "In the upcoming weeks, the American Society of Transplant Surgeons, in conjunction with the American Renal Society and the American Society for Transplantation, will release white papers calling for studies on compensation for organ donation, which the National Organ Transplant Act of 1984 outlaws.\nThat\u2019s part of the reason why only 30 percent of Americans sign up for organ donation.\nFacebook has also recently allowed users to disclose their organ donation status on the social network as a means of compelling others to join the registry.\nSince the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) carried out the law, the organ donation waitlist has increased by more than 1200 percent.\nHigh health care costs, however, often prevent many people from carrying out the altruistic act."}
