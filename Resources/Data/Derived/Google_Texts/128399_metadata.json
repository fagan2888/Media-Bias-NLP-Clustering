Men in suits wait for the wandering neurosurgeon to pass by so they can pounce with their pitch for the latest, greatest technology that will change brain surgery forever.\n\n\u201cPatterns repeat themselves over and over in nature. We see that in our work and in anatomy.\u201d\n\nBut back at exhibit booth 630, it\u2019s a different scene. An art show. Paintings and photographs depict abstract interpretations by neurosurgeons of their work, portraits of neurosurgery patients and natural landscapes that offer a striking resemblance to the human brain.\n\n\u201cMusic, art, the visual, the senses \u2014 matches and melds with medicine,\u201d says Dr. Kathryn Ko, a neurosurgeon from New York who curated the show. \u201cWe like to see that left brain, right brain cross over. It\u2019s a respite where you don\u2019t have to concentrate. You can just let your eyes roam.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe theme of this year\u2019s American Association of Neurological Surgeons annual conference is \u201cExpanding Neurosurgery\u201d and Ko wanted to expand beyond the scientific. Throughout the exhibit space, she hung sheets of music from Modest Mussorgsky\u2019s \u201cPictures at an Exhibition.\u201d It was an insightful choice for a neurosurgeon. The composer wrote the piano suite after a dear friend died of a brain aneurysm, and he based the work on his experience walking through an exhibit of the friend\u2019s drawings.\n\nKo played on the theme further, creating installations that overlaid surgical instruments on the sheet music. She dropped medical supplies into her own paintings.\n\n\u201cOne of my pieces is called \u2018Craniotomy in G sharp,\u2019\u201d she says, pointing to a canvas that closes in on a surgeon\u2019s hands opening a skull. \u201cIt\u2019s because the drill that we use to open the brain, when it\u2019s properly working, emits the sound that is G sharp. And because I have perfect pitch I can tell whether or not the nurses have turned the drill on properly.\u201d\n\nAnother piece, displayed on a music stand, uses white and red gauze to create an impression of a needle holder, a tool used to suture skin after surgery.\n\n\u201cThe needle has a little bit of glitter on it so it catches your eye as you walk by,\u201d she says.\n\nFor Shelly Timmons, a trauma neurosurgeon from Pennsylvania, she sees her work in nature. She displayed two photographs she took of geysers in Yellowstone National Park.\n\n\u201cPatterns repeat themselves over and over in nature,\u201d she says. \u201cWe see that in our work and in anatomy.\u201d\n\nOne photo shows a flat sandy rock flanked by blue and clear water.\n\n\u201cThis particular piece reminds me a lot of the surface of the brain,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s a structure in the brain called the choroid plexus, which produces spinal fluid. This piece reminds me of that, and it\u2019s surrounded by fluid so it\u2019s sort of thematic.\u201d\n\nThe human side of neurosurgery comes through as well. Dr. Bob Dempsey, a professor of neurosurgery at the University of Wisconsin, displayed a portrait of a woman he took while working in Africa. She is dressed in a colorful wrap, gazing down at her child.\n\n\u201cI call this the face of hydrocephalus,\u201d he says. \u201cHydrocephalus is a condition where spinal fluid in the central nervous system builds up in the brain, causing pressure. It ends in mental retardation, paralysis or death. It\u2019s a very endemic problem in the developing world.\u201d\n\nIt is reversible, though, and after he treated this woman\u2019s child, he asked if he could take her picture.\n\n\u201cThe compositor was hers, just the way she cared for the child, and all I did was try to capture that,\u201d he says.", "article_metadata": {"description": "You might not expect to find an art gallery at a convention of neuroscientists.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"In San Francisco, Brain Surgeons Explore Their Practice Through Art\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2014\\/04\\/09\\/neuroscientists-create-the-art-of-medicine\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-04-09 11:47:33\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-01-13 11:56:42\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":18614,\"author_id\":\"3205\",\"author_name\":\"April Dembosky\",\"author_display_name\":\"April Dembosky\",\"tags\":[\"Science\"],\"categories\":[\"Living Healthy\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2014\\/04\\/Neuro1-e1397066807510.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "You might not expect to find an art gallery at a convention of neuroscientists.", "title": "In San Francisco, Brain Surgeons Explore Their Practice Through Art", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2014/04/09/neuroscientists-create-the-art-of-medicine/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2014/04/Neuro3-300x252.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "science", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Most of the Moscone Center exhibit hall is full of looming medical machines: brain scanners and brain mappers.\n\u201cWe like to see that left brain, right brain cross over.\n\u201cHydrocephalus is a condition where spinal fluid in the central nervous system builds up in the brain, causing pressure.\nPaintings and photographs depict abstract interpretations by neurosurgeons of their work, portraits of neurosurgery patients and natural landscapes that offer a striking resemblance to the human brain.\nWe see that in our work and in anatomy.\u201dBut back at exhibit booth 630, it\u2019s a different scene."}
