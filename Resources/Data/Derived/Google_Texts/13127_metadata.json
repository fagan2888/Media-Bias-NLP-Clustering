John Breaux (D-La.) and Trent Lott (R-Miss.), who now head Squire Patton\u2019s lobby shop, in a statement.\n\nLast year, Squire Patton Boggs lost a huge chunk of its healthcare policy practice \u2014 including its founder, John Jonas \u2014 to competitor Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld. The 11 defecting lobbyists took about $5 million worth of annual advocacy business with them.\n\nBlackwood\u2019s hire gives prospective clients of Squire Patton Boggs a former high-ranking official that can navigate regulatory and investigative challenges from both agencies and lawmakers. It could also attract other new talent to the firm, which is still in the process of rebounding from the loss of the health policy team.\n\nIn addition to her administration experience \u2014 she also spent more than a decade at the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legislative Affairs \u2014 Blackwood also worked on Capitol Hill as chief counsel for the Senate Special Committee on Aging and as investigative counsel for the House Energy and Commerce Committee.\n\n\u201cI have come full-circle in my career and I\u2019m excited to be back in the private law sector,\u201d said Blackwood, referring to beginning her career at law and lobby firm McDermott, Will & Emery.\n\n\u201cHaving worked in the healthcare arena for over two decades, I have witnessed the industry undergo tremendous reform,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cSquire Patton Boggs\u2019 provides an ideal platform that will allow me to bring my experiences to bear to help clients.\u201d\n\nSquire Patton Boggs remains the No. 2 firm on K Street by revenue, earning $31.6 million lobbying fees last year.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Squire Patton Boggs is rehabbing its healthcare practice.", "description": "Squire Patton Boggs is rehabbing its healthcare practice.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Megan R.
