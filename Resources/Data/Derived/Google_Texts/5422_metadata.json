He\u2019ll go in this summer along with former Atlanta Braves teammate Tom Glavine and former Chicago White Sox slugger Frank Thomas.\n\nIt\u2019s a fine, worthy class. You can make cases for a number of others but the three who definitely belong in got in the Hall.\n\nSEE ALSO: Full house: Maddux leads biggest Hall of Fame class since 1999\n\nThe only real question lingering over the process is how 16 of the 571 voters could leave Maddux off their ballot.\n\nIf ever a player defines Hall of Famer, it is Maddux. While he might not compare image-wise to a Michael Jordan in basketball or Jerry Rice in football, he was every bit as top-tier in his sport. He wasn\u2019t fancy. He wasn\u2019t flashy. He wasn\u2019t an outsized personality. He was merely the best pitcher of his generation and one of the best pitchers ever.\n\nIn a long career that has involved watching a lot of sports on a lot of levels, Maddux is easily one of the top three performers ever witnessed. Sports writers are often asked, who would you pay to see? Maddux. Repeatedly. He was that good.\n\nA few numbers for those unfamiliar with his work: A 355-227 record over 23 seasons. Seventeen straight seasons with at least 15 victories. A seven-season stretch where his highest earned run average was 2.72. Back-to-back seasons in Atlanta where he went a combined 35-8 with ERAs of 1.56 and 1.63. From the time he was 22 until the time he was 40, he pitched at least 200 innings every year but one. That season, he missed by two-thirds of an inning.\n\nHe won the Cy Young Award four years in a row. He won 18 Gold Gloves.\n\nRemarkable excellence for a very long time.\n\nYou look at those numbers and, without an image of Maddux, might conjure up a vision of a menancing, intimidating presence like 6-foot-11 Randy Johnson, who could unleash the pitch in a wild flurry of arms, legs and long hair. Or of a steely-gazed Roger Clemens and his overpowering fastball.\n\nNope. Maddux is listed at 6-foot and 170-pounds, which frankly seems to be a slight exaggeration. When he wore his glasses on non-pitching days, he looked more like your local Eagle Scout than a dominating athlete.\n\nSomeone on every team he pitched probably had a better fastball, a better curve, a better change, a better slider. But nobody had a more complete repertoire of pitches or a fast-working brain that allowed him to stay a step ahead of almost every hitter.\n\nDon Sutton, another Hall of Fame pitcher who spent the Maddux years in Atlanta as a broadcaster, summed him up as well as anybody.\n\nMaddux, Sutton said, \u201ccan hit a gnat in the butt from 60 feet with four different pitches.\u201d\n\nYou combine that kind of arsenal with Maddux\u2019s mind and you get a Hall of Famer, a guy who was a favorite of writers on deadline because games he started tended to end in closer to two hours than three.\n\nAround the media, Maddux was polite and available though far from expansive. He knew he was darn good. You don\u2019t post the numbers he did for as long as he did without having an incredible level of confidence. But he never passed himself off as anything special.\n\nHe practically bristled at the suggestion he was some sort of baseball savant, a fanatic with his preparation. The idea of Maddux with complex charts and graphs and assorted other information was false.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more knowing a little about the opposition,\u201d Maddux said in a 1995 interview with the Richmond Times-Dispatch, \u201cand knowing a lot about yourself.\u201d\n\nMaddux didn\u2019t dominate in the postseason like he did in the regular season, though much of that is a function of the way his team was playing rather than the way he was pitching. He played in 23 postseason series in his career and never won more than a game in any of them. His postseason record was a pedestrian 11-14. But his postseason ERA of 3.24 is only a tick higher than his career ERA of 3.16. Heck, he was 0-2 in a 1997 series against the eventual World Series champion Marlins despite giving up just two earned runs in 13 innings.\n\nSure, a couple more championship rings would have added to the legend. Maddux pitched in three World Series (1995, 1996 and 1999) and the Braves won just one of them (1995). Maddux played with three other teams \u2014 the Cubs, Dodgers and Padres \u2014 and none made it to the Series.\n\nBut a lack of rings shouldn\u2019t detract from what Maddux did so well for so very long. Few people have a career in any sport that screams Hall of Famer as loudly as Maddux\u2019s did.\n\nThat he\u2019s in the Hall is appropriate. That he isn\u2019t unanimous is baffling.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Maddux, Tom Glavine and Frank Thomas is a fine, worthy class.
