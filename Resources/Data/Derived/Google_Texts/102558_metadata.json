As reported by the Washington Post, Mr. Rove is a volunteer for that organization and receives no financial benefit either directly or indirectly from American Crossroads, Crossroads GPS or any of its vendors or subvendors.\n\nWhy is Karl Rove trying to help Bernie Sanders win the Democratic nomination?\n\nFour years after Karl Rove wasted over $300 million from establishment GOP donors in his unsuccessful attempt to use his Super PAC American Crossroads to elect Mitt Romney president, he\u2019s started running ads in the Democratic primary race against Hillary Clinton in Iowa. Why?\n\nBack in 2012, Rove raised all that money to run anti-Obama and pro-Romney ads. This year Crossroads is probably finding it hard to make an argument for investing in its efforts, because donors are still smarting from 2012\u2019s failed campaign, and they are feeling fleeced again after giving to Jeb Bush\u2019s lackluster 2016 presidential campaign and Super PAC.\n\nIn a year when advertising dollars have done little to move voters, that won\u2019t stop Rove from trying. So how is a GOP establishment Super PAC manager supposed to survive in 2016? He just has to be more creative in his dog-and-pony show to donors. \u201cIt looks like the Brooklyn Bridge isn\u2019t for sale, but look over here. Here\u2019s the Manhattan Bridge. Let\u2019s see if we can buy this one!\u201d In other words, pivot away from helping establishment GOP candidates, and run ads in the Democratic primary.\n\nNow, Rove is likely making the case to the big GOP donors, who are a little Super PAC shy, that he\u2019s the only one who can stop Hillary from being elected president. More specifically, they have to stop her in the Democratic primary because the leading GOP candidates, Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, can\u2019t beat her in the general election. The old socialist from Vermont, Bernie Sanders, is an easier opponent for Trump or Cruz in November. So don\u2019t waste your money with Bush, Rubio, Kasich, Christie. Send it to Crossroads. That\u2019s the best investment. Rove will beat Clinton in the primary, so we will have a chance of winning in the general. That\u2019s the pitch from Rove, and it\u2019s just got to be the motivation behind the anti-Clinton ads.", "article_metadata": {"description": "What's behind Rove's new anti-Hillary ads in Iowa?
