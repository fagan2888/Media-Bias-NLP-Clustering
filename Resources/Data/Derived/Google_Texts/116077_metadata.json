The program, however, will expire Sept. 30 without additional funding.The repeal bill the House passed Thursday, known as the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, includes $60 million for the program in both fiscal 2016 and 2017.\u201cIt costs $132 million annually to run the program, so the amounts in the bill are less than half of what's needed,\u201d said Cristine Serrano, executive director of the American Association of Teaching Health Centers. \u201cBut it will allow us to fight another day and stay alive until we're able to find a more permanent solution.\u201dThe residency slots the money will support are three-year positions. So, in addition to not fully funding existing programs, it will be leaving programs digging to find money to pay for the last year of their residents' training.\u201cIn order to recruit next year, we'll have to get funding for the third year,\u201d Serrano said. \u201cThere are programs that are just shutting down.\u201dOne such program is run by the Clinica Sierra Vista in Fresno, Calif., Serrano said. She added that she used to work for the Northwestern University-affiliated Erie Family Health Center in Chicago's Humboldt Park Puerto Rican enclave. That teaching health center program is cutting back from eight residents to six this July, according to Serrano.Congressional interest in the program was heightened after a policy research brief was released by George Washington University's Geiger Gibson/RCHN Community Health Foundation Research Collaborative showing the program's early success, Serrano said.\n\nThe brief cited a survey which found that 76% of the 91 new doctors who had finished the program were working in underserved areas, compared to only 26% of their peers. Also, 21% were practicing in rural areas compared to just 8% of their peers.The American Association of Teaching Health Centers' strategy was to get funding for the program included in the latest \u201cdoc fix\u201d bill\u2014the legislative device used to postpone SGR-driven cuts in Medicare physician reimbursement. The group sprang into action when word of a possible SGR-repeal bill emerged and circulated \u201cdear colleague\u201d letters in the House and Senate urging the inclusion of a Teaching Health Center appropriation in the measure.\u201cProviding GME training opportunities in diverse geographic locations is important because we know that 55% of all family physicians practice within 100 miles of their residency program and 46% will practice within 50 miles of their training program,\u201d the House letter stated (PDF) . \u201cThe THCGME program, in our opinion, has met its charge and is worthy of continued support.\u201dThe drive to circulate the letter, addressed to House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), was led by Reps. Niki Tsongas (D-Mass.) and Doug LaMalfa (R-Calif.) who both have teaching health centers operating in their districts, Serrano said. Fifty House members signed the letter before it was sent to Boehner and Pelosi March 19.Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) had sponsored a bill to provide $420 million to extend the program through fiscal 2019, but no action was taken on the measure after it was introduced last July. Murray and Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) have circulated a similar letter in their chamber.\u201cBy training primary-care physicians in community-based settings, teaching health center residency programs have created a physician and dentist workforce pipeline that increases underserved areas' ability to retain physicians,\u201d the Senate letter stated (PDF) . \u201cResidents at teaching health centers develop the skills to provide care to challenging patient populations outside of a hospital setting.\u201dThe American Academy of Family Physicians praised the inclusion of Teaching Health Center funding in the SGR-repeal bill\u201cBy moving training into the community, THCs are on the leading edge of innovative educational programming dedicated to ensuring a sufficient supply of primary-care physicians,\u201d Dr. Reid Blackwelder, AAFP board chairman, wrote in a letter to House members. \u201cWe believe that investment in these innovative THCs will help lead to a better distribution of family physicians in rural and underserved communities across the country.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#0a365e", "description": "The House bill that would repeal Medicare's sustainable-growth rate formula for paying physicians would also keep alive a popular graduate medical education program for at least two more years.", "title": "Teaching Health Center program may live to 'fight another day'", "og": {"site_name": "Modern Healthcare", "description": "The House bill that would repeal Medicare's sustainable-growth rate formula for paying physicians would also keep alive a popular graduate medical education program for at least two more years.", "title": "House doc-fix bill would also help fund Teaching Health Center program", "url": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20150326/NEWS/150329941", "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/mh-logo-fb-lg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com", "description": "The House bill that would repeal Medicare's sustainable-growth rate formula for paying physicians would also keep alive a popular graduate medical education program for at least two more years.", "creator": "@modrnhealthcr", "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/mh-logo-twitter.jpg", "title": "House doc-fix bill would also help fund Teaching Health Center program", "site": "@modrnhealthcr", "card": "summary"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Modern Healthcare", "published_at": "2015-03-26", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "url": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20150326/NEWS/150329941", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "msapplication-TileImage": "https:/raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/ms-touch-icon-144x144-precomposed.png", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/mh-logo-g-plus.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0225\"", "article_summary": "She added that she used to work for the Northwestern University-affiliated Erie Family Health Center in Chicago's Humboldt Park Puerto Rican enclave.\nand Doug LaMalfa (R-Calif.) who both have teaching health centers operating in their districts, Serrano said.\n\u201cThere are programs that are just shutting down.\u201dOne such program is run by the Clinica Sierra Vista in Fresno, Calif., Serrano said.\nFifty House members signed the letter before it was sent to Boehner and Pelosi March 19.Sen.\n\u201cWe believe that investment in these innovative THCs will help lead to a better distribution of family physicians in rural and underserved communities across the country.\u201d"}
