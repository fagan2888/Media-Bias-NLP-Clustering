I mean by like a mile.\u201d This statement makes it appear like Obama was saying \u201cthe United States [has] the highest homicide rate among the industrialized world.\u201d And the Washington Post says that claim is \u201cfactually incorrect.\u201d\n\nIn the second of the three, Obama said: \u201cIt\u2019s easier for you to buy a handgun and clips than it is for you to buy a fresh vegetable.\u201d WAPO cried foul, saying that as far they know, \u201cthere are no areas in the United States where background checks are needed to buy vegetables.\u201d\n\nIn the third of the three, Obama said some gun rights proponents respond to school and public shootings by saying \u201cwe should have firearms in kindergarten and machine guns in bars.\u201d Obama added, \u201c[If] you think I\u2019m exaggerating\u2013I mean, you look at some of the laws that come up.\u201d\n\nThe Post spoke to States United to Prevent Gun Violence\u2019s Cathie Whittenburg on this one, and while she provided Obama a degree of cover on the claim that gun rights groups want to arm teachers for children\u2019s safety, she said the machine guns-in-bars claim is an \u201cexaggeration.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post surmises: \u201cThe president is playing fast and loose with his language here\u2026[But] the gun debate is serious enough that it should not be poisoned by exaggerated claims and faux statistics.\u201d\n\nFollow AWR Hawkins on Twitter @AWRHawkins.
