Prompted by these reports, the researchers investigated 300 cases, interviewing the patient and doctors involved.\n\nOne of the most striking findings, says the study\u2019s lead author, Jaideep Pandit of Oxford University Hospitals, was that pain was not generally the worst part of the experience: It was paralysis.\n\nFor some operations, paralyzing drugs are given to relax muscles and stop reflex movements.\n\n\u201cPain was something they understood, but very few of us have experienced what it\u2019s like to be paralyzed,\u201d Pandit says. \u201cThey thought they had been buried alive.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought I was about to die,\u201d says Sandra, who regained consciousness but was unable to move during a dental operation when she was 12 years old. \u201cIt felt as though nothing would ever work again \u2014 as though the anesthetist had removed everything apart from my soul.\u201d\n\nThe audit found that most episodes of awareness were brief and happened before or after the surgery took place. But waking still caused distress in 51 percent of cases. In addition to paralysis, people reported sensations of pain and choking.\n\nThe audit found a much lower incidence of waking up than previous studies: one case for every 19,000 operations involving general anesthesia.\n\nSmaller studies had suggested the rate could be as high as one in 500.\n\nThe latest study tallied only reports that were volunteered by patients; older studies questioned everyone who underwent surgery. This proactive questioning could overestimate the problem, Pandit says.\n\nBut John Andrzejowski, an anesthetist at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital in Sheffield, thinks the latest audit probably missed many non-trivial cases. \u201cThe true figure is probably somewhere in the middle,\u201d he says.\n\nThe audit team is urging anesthetists to use a device called a nerve stimulator to enable them to give the minimum dose. A lower dose should be enough to stop spontaneous movements, yet still allow the patient to move if he becomes conscious enough to feel pain, Pandit says.\n\nSometimes complete paralysis is essential to avoid severing a nerve, points out Andrzejowski, who advocates using monitors that record brain activity through scalp electrodes. But Pandit argues that these give no clear signal of consciousness and are hard to interpret.\n\n\u2013 Clare Wilson, New Scientist", "article_metadata": {"wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0b3b\"", "article_summary": "A: If you\u2019re facing surgery, this may well be your worst nightmare: waking up while under the knife without medical staff realizing.\nA lower dose should be enough to stop spontaneous movements, yet still allow the patient to move if he becomes conscious enough to feel pain, Pandit says.\nQ: Is it true that people can \u201cwake up\u201d under general anesthesia during surgery, and that the experience can be terrifying?\n\u201cPain was something they understood, but very few of us have experienced what it\u2019s like to be paralyzed,\u201d Pandit says.\nThe audit found a much lower incidence of waking up than previous studies: one case for every 19,000 operations involving general anesthesia."}
