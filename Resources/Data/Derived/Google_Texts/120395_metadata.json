John McCollister of Omaha sponsors LB 1032, the Transitional Health Insurance Program Act, which he says combines the use of private insurance with efforts to transition Nebraskans off public assistance.\n\nMcCollister acknowledges he campaigned against the Affordable Care Act as executive director of the Platte Institute prior to being elected to the Unicameral, but has concluded the federal health care law will never be overturned.\n\nAnd McCollister says other Republicans have reached the same conclusion, at least when it comes to accepting the federal government\u2019s generous offer to pay 90% of the cost of expansion.\n\n\u201cExpansion isn\u2019t a partisan issue,\u201d McCollister tells reporters during a Capitol news conference. \u201cThirty-one states have expanded Medicaid and another four or five are underway. Republican governors in nine states \u2013 Arizona, Arkansas, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, and Ohio \u2013 have expanded Medicaid or defended past expansions in their state.\u201d\n\nOpposition remains in the Unicameral. McCollister\u2019s old employer, the Platte Institute, has come out against his plan and it appears enough senators stand in opposition to keep the plan from getting to a vote. Gov. Pete Ricketts has also reiterated his opposition.\n\nUnder the ACA, the federal government has promised to pay 90% of the cost of expansion. Proponents of expansion estimate it will bring two billion dollars into the state over the next five years and lead to creation of as many as 10,000 direct and indirect jobs.\n\nThe Transitional Health Insurance Program Act would use Medicaid dollars to purchase private insurance for most of the 77,000 Nebraskans who would be covered under Medicaid expansion. Medicaid dollars could even be used to supplement employer-sponsored insurance coverage.\n\nRecipients would be required to pay 2% of their monthly income as an insurance premium. The use of a hospital emergency room for non-emergency visits would cost $50 under the plan.\n\nEnrollees in the program would be referred to job training and educational programs aimed at getting them to higher paying jobs with better benefits.\n\nSen. Kathy Campbell of Lincoln, who has unsuccessfully sponsored Medicaid expansion bills in the past, says this latest proposal could really help those working poor trying to get ahead.\n\n\u201cIt is a transition for Nebraskans to their own health care,\u201d Campbell says. \u201cIt is a transition to preventative care. It is a transition to workforce and education and it is a transition to decreased dependence on public programs.\u201d\n\nSen. Heath Mello of Omaha asserts the proposal should address the concerns raised over the years by opponents.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s paramount that we\u2019ve been able to draft something that is bipartisan in nature, that\u2019s General Fund-neutral moving forward and, to some extent, tries to take what we\u2019ve heard from the opposition over the last three years, in floor debate and outside of the legislature; we have taken their considerations, their concepts and proposals and have incorporate (them) into this third way approach,\u201d according to Mello.\n\nNebraska would have to receive a waiver from the federal government to implement the plan.\n\nAUDIO: Sen.
