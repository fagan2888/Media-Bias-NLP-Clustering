That's enough water to fill an Olympic-sized swimming pool every 7 seconds.\n\nAnother crew was taking water samples of something else.\n\n\"Our project is designed to try and quantify how much mercury is moving through the system, so it's an excellent opportunity to try and capture it while it is moving a lot of mercury at once,\" said Charles Alpers, a USGS research chemist.\n\nThat mercury ends up in high amounts in insects, birds and fish and can pose a risk to people who eat the fish.\n\nSome of that mercury comes from old mercury mines miles upstream in the coastal range. However, it can also come naturally from the area around Woodland when it is picked up with the storm water runoff.\n\nResearchers said half of the mercury that ends up in the Delta flows through Cache Creek, but they add that it's just as important to understand how much water is moving through here so local, state and federal agencies can better predict floods or take measures to avoid them altogether.\n\n--\n\nMore on KCRA.com:\n\n+How much rain did we get? 24-hour storm totals\n\n+See how much snow fell in the Sierra\n\n\n\n+30 photos from front lines of KCRA's storm coverage", "article_metadata": {"category": "Local News", "ib-analytics": "data", "item-publish-date": "Fri, 12 Dec 2014 19:24:34 PST", "generator": "CoreMedia", "author": "Kevin Oliver", "og": {"site_name": "KCRA", "description": "The NorCal storm brought plenty of rain to the region, and some scientists are taking advantage of high water levels at area creeks and streams.", "title": "NorCal storm causes creeks, streams to swell over banks", "url": "http://www.kcra.com/news/norcal-storm-causes-creeks-streams-to-swell-over-banks/30207136", "image": "http://www.kcra.com/image/view/-/30208890/highRes/1/-/maxh/630/maxw/1200/-/svpxnaz/-/Cache-Creek-png.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.kcra.com/news/norcal-storm-causes-creeks-streams-to-swell-over-banks/30207136", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "kcra://content/article/30207136", "iphone": "kcra://content/article/30207136", "googleplay": "kcra://content/article/30207136"}, "name": {"ipad": "kcra", "iphone": "kcra", "googleplay": "kcra"}, "id": {"ipad": 505581274, "iphone": 505581274, "googleplay": "com.hearst.android.kcra"}}, "site": "@kcranews", "card": "app"}, "description": "The NorCal storm brought plenty of rain to the region, and some scientists are taking advantage of high water levels at area creeks and streams.", "al": {"android": {"url": "kcra://content/article/30207136", "app_name": "kcra", "package": "com.hearst.android.kcra"}, "ios": {"url": "kcra://content/article/30207136", "app_store_id": 505581274, "app_name": "kcra"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 102798321191}, "keywords": "cache creek, woodland, storm water, norcal storm, overflowing creeks, kcra, kcra 3, kcra.com, kcra3, kcra news, kcra channel,", "google-site-verification": "lseesGPufjGiNJ4blx9-qW5A0JKGfgPc9Mw6RTc9Ulo", "news_keywords": "cache creek, woodland, storm water, norcal storm, overflowing creeks, kcra, kcra 3, kcra.com, kcra3, kcra news, kcra channel,"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd076d\"", "article_summary": "Stretching nearly the width of a football field, Cache Creek outside of Woodland was barely contained within its banks Friday morning.\nHowever, it can also come naturally from the area around Woodland when it is picked up with the storm water runoff.\n24-hour storm totals+See how much snow fell in the Sierra+30 photos from front lines of KCRA's storm coverage\nAt Cache Creek, crews measured 12,000 cubic feet of water per second.\n\"Every so often, you'll see a decent-sized tree going by, and if that were to snag on our equipment, that could cause us some problems,\" said Jeff Kitchen, a USGS water specialist."}
