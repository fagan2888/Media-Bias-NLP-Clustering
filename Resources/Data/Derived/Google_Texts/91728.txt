The Food and Drug Administration proposed a ban on electrical stimulation devices used for self-injurious or aggressive behavior Friday, pointing to a public health risk.

The FDA said in a press release that the devices, which are often used by people looking to curb bad habits, are connected to serious psychological and physical risks. “As these risks cannot be eliminated through new or updated labeling, banning the product is necessary to protect public health,” the release said.

Depression, anxiety, pain, burns and tissue damage are some of the effects that are connected to the devices, the FDA says.

“Our primary concern is the safety and well-being of the individuals who are exposed to these devices,” William Maisel, acting director of the Office of Device Evaluation in the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health, said in a statement. “These devices are dangerous and a risk to public health — and we believe they should not be used.”

The agency said there is one U.S. facility using the devices, with roughly 45 or 50 patients that are exposed to them, according to their information.

The proposed rule is open for comment for 30 days.
