May plans to formally announce that he is running for the Texas 19th U.S. Congressional District in a series of town hall meetings.\n\nOn Wednesday night, the Lubbock resident sent an email to media outlets throughout the district indicating that earlier in the day he filled a Statement of Candidacy for 2016 with the Federal Election Commission.\n\n\u201cI will soon be announcing the times and locations of my official campaign kickoff,\u201d he added.\n\nIn his media advisory, May issued a public statement to those in the district which is currently represented by Randy Neugebauer, who is not seeking re-election.\n\nMay\u2019s statement, in part, reads, \u201cI am running for the United States House of Representatives because I am alarmed by how very rapidly Obama has greatly damaged our nation by weakening our national security, destroying our jobs, and undermining our prosperity. Our national security must be rapidly restored, especially our military preparedness. Our border must be rapidly and completely secured by our military and a combination of federal, state, and local police agencies. We need to know who and what is entering and leaving our nation.\u201d\n\nHe pledged to \u201cwrite bills intended to incrementally take apart ObamaCare, the EPA, the IRS, the Department of Energy, the Department of Education, and the bloated welfare system. This money and power must be returned to the people and to the individual states where the 10th Amendment tells us it belongs in the first place.\u201d\n\nThe conservative has long been active in Lubbock area politics and has been a 19th Congressional District delegate to at least two National Republican Conventions.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "MyPlainview.com", "description": "Lubbock Republic Donald R.
