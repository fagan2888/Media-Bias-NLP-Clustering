Like President Obama, New York Times reporter Jonathan Weisman thinks soon-to-be canceled health insurance policies are crap. If you like your plan, it’s reasonable to assume that Weisman thinks you are a moron.

Tell it to Edie Sundby.

Tell it to Robert Laszewski.

Tell it to Dean Griffin.

Tell is to Kirsten Powers.

Tell it to David Frum.

@jonathanweisman @ron_fournier not lousy coverage. Rational choices for young people to choose less and catastrophic. — pandk (@potsandkettles) November 16, 2013

LOUSY plans? That's an Obama line. People liked those plans @jonathanweisman: by letting healthy young keep lousy plans, risk pool — Richard Grenell (@RichardGrenell) November 16, 2013

@RichardGrenell @jonathanweisman who decided those plans were lousy? "If they like them, they can keep them, period." Remember? — Jeremy Randall Piper (@JeremyR86) November 16, 2013

There was a time when New York Times reporters pretended to be neutral. Now they don’t even try to hide their bias.

Perhaps Weisman is auditioning for Nick Kristof’s job. Or Jay Carney’s.
