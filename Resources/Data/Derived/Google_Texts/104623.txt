Lead, SD

The craft beer boom has come to the western South Dakota city of Lead.



Linda and Steve Shivers opened Dakota Shivers Brewing earlier this year in this city of 3,000-plus residents. The brewery has five craft beers on tap, and they're brewed by Linda Shivers below the taproom.



Steve Shivers has homebrewed beer on and off for roughly 30 years. He says he learned from those experiences and from a childhood friend who owned a brewery in Alaska.



The Black Hills Pioneer reports South Dakota has more than a dozen craft breweries, and more are pending.



Steve Shivers says he tells people that the area is on the "frontier of craft beer" because it's the "last place" to take off.
