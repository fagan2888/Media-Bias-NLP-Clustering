Bernie Sanders, who is currently holding a 27 point lead over Hillary Clinton and polling at a 91 percent favorability among voters in the state, according to the most recent WMUR/CNN poll.\n\nBill Clinton didn't mention the senator from Vermont by name but regularly referred to him as \"her opponent.\" He struck hard on Sanders, attacking him on calling Planned Parenthood part of the \u201cestablishment.\" The Clinton campaign, who has the endorsement of Planned Parenthood, pounced on this.\n\n\u201cIf you elect Hillary president, it will be a great day when you stop her from defunding Planned Parenthood,\u201d Bill Clinton said today. \u201cHillary Clinton does not consider Planned Parenthood a member of the establishment.\u201d\n\nThe former president then dove in on health care, a topic that daughter Chelsea Clinton tackled last week in New Hampshire when she said that Sen. Sanders wants to \u201cdismantle the Affordable Care Act.\"\n\n\u201cOn health care, Hillary thinks we should remember how important the Affordable Care Act is,\u201d began the president. \u201cHer opponent says, no, we should scrap that and go into a single-payer system.\u201d\n\nThe president was referring to Sanders\u2019 plan to pay for a single-payer system that he release released moments before the last Democratic debate. The president called the senator\u2019s plan unsustainable, saying it encourages \u201covercharging and inflation.\u201d\n\nThe president quickly shifted gears to the college students in the room, a demographic that has been leaning heavily toward Bernie Sanders. \u201cBoth of these candidates want to make college affordable,\u201d said the president. \u201cHillary recognizes the burden on people after they graduate.\u201d\n\nA talking point of Hillary Clinton\u2019s college affordability plan is that college should not be free for everyone because that includes the very rich, often saying that Republican front-runner Donald Trump\u2019s children should not go to school for free. Today, Bill Clinton brought the argument a bit closer to home, pointing at himself, saying, \u201cThe one place she disagrees with her opponent is that she thinks people like us should pay to go to college,\u201d said the president. \u201cWe can afford it, and the budget can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nBill Clinton will take his campaigning to Las Vegas Thursday night. It will be his first campaign stop in Nevada, and it comes just days ahead of the Clinton Foundation Health Matters Annual Activation Summit, which will feature another prominent Hillary Clinton surrogate, Abby Wambach.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Bill Clinton Attacks Sanders on Planned Parenthood, Health Care", "description": "Clinton is on his 3rd campaign trip to New Hampshire campaigning for his wife.", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 ABC News Internet Ventures", "author": "ABC News", "og": {"site_name": "ABC News", "description": "Clinton is on his 3rd campaign trip to New Hampshire campaigning for his wife.", "title": "Bill Clinton Attacks Sanders on Planned Parenthood, Health Care", "url": "http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/bill-clinton-attacks-bernie-sanders-planned-parenthood-health/story?id=36407492", "image": "http://a.abcnews.go.com/images/Politics/AP_bernie_sanders_bill_clinton_ml_160118_16x9_992.jpg", "type": "article"}, "Date": "2016-01-21", "twitter": {"description": "Clinton is on his 3rd campaign trip to New Hampshire campaigning for his wife.", "title": "Bill Clinton Attacks Sanders on Planned Parenthood, Health Care", "url": "http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/bill-clinton-attacks-bernie-sanders-planned-parenthood-health/story?id=36407492", "image": "http://a.abcnews.go.com/images/Politics/AP_bernie_sanders_bill_clinton_ml_160118_4x3t_240.jpg", "creator": "@MattJClaiborne", "site": "@ABC", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "abcnewsipad://link/story,36407492", "iphone": "abcnewsiphone://link/story,36407492", "googleplay": "android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Politics/bill-clinton-attacks-bernie-sanders-planned-parenthood-health/story?id=36407492"}, "name": {"ipad": "ABC News", "iphone": "ABC News", "googleplay": "ABC News"}, "id": {"ipad": 306934135, "iphone": 300255638, "googleplay": "com.abc.abcnews"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "index, follow", "DC.date.issued": "2016-01-21", "al": {"ipad": {"url": "abcnewsipad://link/story,36407492", "app_store_id": 380520716, "app_name": "ABC News for iPad"}, "web": {"url": "http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/bill-clinton-attacks-bernie-sanders-planned-parenthood-health/story?id=36407492"}, "android": {"url": "android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Politics/bill-clinton-attacks-bernie-sanders-planned-parenthood-health/story?id=36407492", "app_name": "ABC News Breaking Latest News", "package": "com.abc.abcnews"}, "iphone": {"url": "abcnewsiphone://link/story,36407492", "app_store_id": 300255638, "app_name": "ABC News - Breaking US & World News"}}, "Last-Modified": "2016-01-21 13:56:43", "fb": {"admins": 704409894, "app_id": 4942312939}, "keywords": "Bernie Sanders, Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, health care, Planned Parenthood, politics news, election news, political news, political news articles", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Bernie Sanders, Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, health care, Planned Parenthood"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIf you elect Hillary president, it will be a great day when you stop her from defunding Planned Parenthood,\u201d Bill Clinton said today.\n\u201cOn health care, Hillary thinks we should remember how important the Affordable Care Act is,\u201d began the president.\nHe struck hard on Sanders, attacking him on calling Planned Parenthood part of the \u201cestablishment.\"\nThe Clinton campaign, who has the endorsement of Planned Parenthood, pounced on this.\nIt will be his first campaign stop in Nevada, and it comes just days ahead of the Clinton Foundation Health Matters Annual Activation Summit, which will feature another prominent Hillary Clinton surrogate, Abby Wambach."}
