A negative surplus is reported liabilities exceeding assets.\n\n\n\nState response: The Michigan Department of Insurance and Financial Services placed staff at HealthPlus offices to monitor progress the company is making on finding a financial partner and with its financial turnaround. HealthPlus also was ordered to stop selling new or renewal policies for its PPO. Its HMO can renew policies but not write new ones. The self-funded PPO and HMO businesses are unaffected, as is the Medicaid HMO.\n\nFlint-based HealthPlus Insurance Co., one of the state's largest nonprofit health insurers, has lost tens of millions of dollars the past two years, prompting the state insurance department to order it to make material progress in seeking an outside financial partner within 60 days, Crain's has learned.\n\n\n\nOn March 9, the Michigan Department of Financial and Insurance Services placed HealthPlus under state financial supervision because of losses in 2014 that lowered its reserves below the required state minimum, said Kathy Bilitzke, HealthPlus manager of public relations.\n\n\n\n\"We are looking at potential long-term strategic partnerships and other affiliations that can improve our financial position,\" said Bilitzke, declining further comment on the search for a new partner.\n\n\n\nThe company also is working with advisers Ernst & Young, Milliman and the Wakely Consulting Group, she said.\n\n\n\nAndrea Miller, DIFS public information officer, said DIFS has placed staff at HealthPlus offices to monitor progress the company is making on finding a financial partner and with its financial turnaround.\n\n\n\n\"HealthPlus has provided DIFS with sufficient information to indicate there are several serious parties interested in partnering with HealthPlus and willing to infuse capital,\" Miller said in an e-mail to Crain's. \"The director has given the companies 60 days to make material progress with another party to consummate a transaction.\"\n\n\n\nBilitzke confirmed HealthPlus was ordered to stop selling new or renewal policies for its preferred provider organization business, which it began seven years ago.\n\n\n\nIts HMO, HealthPlus of Michigan Inc., is allowed to renew policies but not write new ones, she said. The state also is allowing HealthPlus to operate its self-funded PPO and HMO business without restrictions. HealthPlus Partners, a Medicaid HMO, is doing well financially and is unaffected by the state order.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn an e-mail to Crain's, Rick Murdock, executive director of the Michigan Association of Health Plans, said some commercial HMOs have experienced a downturn in margins the past year. He said he couldn't point solely to the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\n\n\"There continues to be great uncertainty due to ACA enrollment and the sequence of developing rates and filing prior to understanding the complete dynamic of your enrollment, and the limitation on underwriting limits the ability to finesse these concerns,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Links", "article_metadata": {"description": "Flint-based HealthPlus Insurance Co., one of the state's largest nonprofit health insurers, has lost tens of millions of dollars the past two years, prompting the state insurance department to order it to make material progress in seeking an outside financial partner within 60 days, Crain's has\u00a0\u2026", "og": {"site_name": "Crain's Detroit Business", "description": "Flint-based HealthPlus Insurance Co., one of the state's largest nonprofit health insurers, has lost tens of millions of dollars the past two years, prompting the state insurance department to order it to make material progress in seeking an outside financial partner within 60 days, Crain's has\u00a0\u2026", "title": "State orders HealthPlus Insurance to find financial partner", "url": "http://www.crainsdetroit.com/article/20150315/NEWS/303159976/state-orders-healthplus-insurance-to-find-financial-partner", "image": "http://www.crainsdetroit.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CD/20150315/NEWS/303159976/V2/0/Rick_Murdock.jpg&MaxW=1400&MaxH=1400", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@crainsdetroit", "card": "summary", "account_id": 29209404}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#b51218", "fb": {"app_id": 112806662066559}, "theme-color": "#b51218", "msapplication-TileImage": "/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"section": "NEWS", "tag": "Health care reform", "published_time": "2015-03-15T08:00:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-19T13:19:00-04:00", "author": "http://www.crainsdetroit.com/staff/JAYGRE"}, "verify-v1": "qPvWKmNahUcs8XBgUi+fy3A5YH6uzhhairJpQFCqXMs=", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdebfd\"", "article_summary": "State orders HealthPlus Insurance to find financial partnerThe why and the response The cause: A negative surplus of $4.8 million in 2014 lowered HealthPlus' reserves below the required state minimum.\nState response: The Michigan Department of Insurance and Financial Services placed staff at HealthPlus offices to monitor progress the company is making on finding a financial partner and with its financial turnaround.\nOn March 9, the Michigan Department of Financial and Insurance Services placed HealthPlus under state financial supervision because of losses in 2014 that lowered its reserves below the required state minimum, said Kathy Bilitzke, HealthPlus manager of public relations.\nFlint-based HealthPlus Insurance Co., one of the state's largest nonprofit health insurers, has lost tens of millions of dollars the past two years, prompting the state insurance department to order it to make material progress in seeking an outside financial partner within 60 days, Crain's has learned.\nIts HMO, HealthPlus of Michigan Inc., is allowed to renew policies but not write new ones, she said."}
