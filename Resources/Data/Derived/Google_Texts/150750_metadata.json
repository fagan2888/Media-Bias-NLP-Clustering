O\u2019Carroll Jr. didn\u2019t specifically blame illegal immigrants in the new study, but signaled the numbers issued legally to visa lottery winners could end up in the hands of unauthorized migrants based on previous work.\n\nThe findings are fueling calls on Capitol Hill to do away with the Diversity Lottery altogether, and to step up controls on the use of Social Security numbers so the government can lock out numbers whose use is questionable.\n\nSEE ALSO: Bill to gut Obamacare, defund Planned Parenthood threatened by warring conservative lobbies\n\n\u201cThe visa lottery is a flawed process for choosing permanent U.S. residents and should be eliminated,\u201d said Rep. Bill Posey, a Florida Republican who is sponsoring a bill to cancel the lottery.\n\nCreated as a way to ensure immigrants from underrepresented countries have a chance at entering the U.S., the DV, as it\u2019s called, is literally a giveaway, offering 50,000 visas a year to those lucky enough to qualify and have their applications randomly selected.\n\nDV winners are entitled to work permits and Social Security numbers \u2014 and some of them were either careless with the numbers, or intentionally gave them away to others, because hundreds of them were used repeatedly with different employers, suggesting fraud was at work.\n\nSEE ALSO: Obama\u2019s EPA ignores congressional mandate for ethanol in gasoline\n\n\u201cWe believe it is questionable when a numberholder\u2019s earnings record indicates he/she worked for a high number of employers. Prior audit work has shown that multiple individuals may use the same name and SSN to work,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Carroll said in his report.\n\nAnother problem was the 207 immigrants who requested three or more replacement Social Security cards \u2014 which Mr. O\u2019Carroll also deemed \u201cquestionable.\u201d Federal law sets a general limit of three cards per year, and 10 per lifetime \u2014 though there are several exceptions, including hardship and name changes.\n\nMr. Carroll did not specifically blame illegal immigrants for the numbers\u2019 misuse, but pointed to previous audits by his office that did find illegal immigrants using Social Security numbers they stole from someone else.\n\nMark Hinkle, a spokesman for Social Security, said without a firm connection, it was difficult to figure out what was going on with the lottery winners, but said there was no indication that Social Security wasn\u2019t following its own rules.\n\n\u201cThis population may be more prone to move frequently, so loss of a card could also occur, but this alone would not be an indication of misuse of the card. In short, the report could further acknowledge the legitimate reasons for requesting a replacement card,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cThese legitimate reasons for requesting a card could account for the number of cards received in the case examples.\u201d\n\nHe said businesses that worry about employees\u2019 legal work status can verify names and numbers of new hires through the Social Security Number Verification Service.\n\nRepublicans on Capitol Hill want to go further. Rep. Bob Goodlatte, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said his colleagues should vote on the Legal Workforce Act, a bill that cleared his panel earlier this year and that requires all companies to use E-Verify to validate their workforce.\n\n\u201cImportantly, it also requires the Department of Homeland Security to lock Social Security numbers that have unusual multiple use in order to prevent identity theft and fraud,\u201d Mr. Goodlatte, Virginia Republican, said. \u201cWe also ought to eliminate the diversity visa lottery to strengthen national security and make legal immigration work better for America.\u201d\n\nThe DV lottery has been a target for some time for Republicans on Capitol Hill, who question its purpose in the first place, and who said the latest findings show how deeply it is pervaded with fraud.\n\nMr. Posey said it made no sense to randomly choose winners without any consideration for whether their work skills were a boon to the U.S. or whether they already had family or work ties here.\n\n\u201cNo other country in the world hands out the privilege of residency to people based solely on winning a lottery,\u201d Mr. Posey said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Diversity Visa lottery, one of America's weirder immigration programs, appears to be a gateway for Social Security fraud, according to the findings of an inspector general's report released last month.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The Diversity Visa lottery, one of America\u2019s weirder immigration programs, appears to be a gateway for Social Security fraud, according to the findings of an inspector general\u2019s report released last month.", "title": "Diversity Visa lottery raises concerns over Social Security fraud", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/nov/30/diversity-visa-lottery-raises-concerns-over-social/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/20/Congress_Syrian_Refugees.JPEG-04d22.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/20/Congress_Syrian_Refugees.JPEG-04d22.jpg", "description": "The Diversity Visa lottery, one of America's weirder immigration programs, appears to be a gateway for Social Security fraud, according to the findings of an inspector general's report released last m", "card": "summary", "title": "Diversity Visa lottery raises concerns over Social Security fraud"}, "Author": "Stephen Dinan", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Labor, Social Issues, Bill Posey, Social Security"}, "article_summary": "The Diversity Visa lottery, one of America\u2019s weirder immigration programs, appears to be a gateway for Social Security fraud, according to the findings of an inspector general\u2019s report released last month.\nMark Hinkle, a spokesman for Social Security, said without a firm connection, it was difficult to figure out what was going on with the lottery winners, but said there was no indication that Social Security wasn\u2019t following its own rules.\n\u201cNo other country in the world hands out the privilege of residency to people based solely on winning a lottery,\u201d Mr. Posey said.\n\u201cImportantly, it also requires the Department of Homeland Security to lock Social Security numbers that have unusual multiple use in order to prevent identity theft and fraud,\u201d Mr. Goodlatte, Virginia Republican, said.\nPrior audit work has shown that multiple individuals may use the same name and SSN to work,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Carroll said in his report."}
