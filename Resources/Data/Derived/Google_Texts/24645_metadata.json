Manager Walt Weiss frequently refers to Dickerson as a \u201cnatural born hitter.\u201d So good, and so natural, in fact, Weiss has said: \u201cDickie could wake up, roll out of bed and hit on Christmas morning.\u201d Hence, \u201cMerry Christmas.\u201d\n\nWeiss has also said Dickerson could \u201chit under water,\u201d and Dickerson could \u201chit in his sleep.\u201d\n\nI prefer the Christmas morning reference, even if I don\u2019t quite get it. But, as a reader pointed out, Weiss\u2019 reference is not unique or original. Former Kansas City Royals GM John Schuerholz once said: \u201cGeorge Brett could roll out of bed on Christmas morning and hit a line drive.\u201d\n\nDickerson said he now gets tweets and messages from fans and friends with Christmas themes attached. It seems to be catching on.\n\nOK, now on to No. 2. This one is weird, way out of left field and the result of an inside joke between too strange sports writers.\n\nI was driving to Surprise, Ariz., during spring training along with my good friend Thomas Harding of MLB.com. We were passing the time listening to an oldies station when a Janet Jackson song came on the radio.\n\nI remarked to Thomas that I never thought Janet Jackson could sing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all electronics and background vocals and stuff,\u201d I said.\n\nThomas, who considers himself something of a pop music expert, disagreed.\n\n\u201cJanet could sing a little bit,\u201d he said. \u201cShe just knew what songs to sing, and she knew to stay within her range. Kind of like DJ LeMahieu on offense.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m usually not shocked by anything Thomas says, but this one caught me off guard.\n\n\u201cSo you are equating DJ LeMahieu to Janet Jackson?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cYes, it\u2019s the perfect analogy,\u201d Thomas insisted.\n\nSo, the next day, unbeknownst to Thomas, I informed Weiss of the LeMahieu-Janet Jackson connection. Weiss was, shall we say, perplexed, if not slightly amused.\n\nThat night, LeMahieu hit a double in a Cactus League game.\n\n\u201cAs DJ was running to second base, all I could think of was \u2018wardrobe malfunction,\u201d Weiss deadpanned.\n\nLast Wednesday night in San Francisco after the Rockies beat the Giants, I asked Weiss, \u201cIs DJ still in the Janet Jackson zone?\u201d\n\nRoot Sports was still on the air. All Weiss could do was laugh, look around the room and blame Thomas for instigating me. (He didn\u2019t, by the way).\n\nRoot\u2019s Jenny Cavnar gave me an \u201cI-can\u2019t-believe-you-asked-that look.\u201d\n\nI can\u2019t either.\n\nSo now you know the rest of the story.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Corey Dickerson,DJ Lemahieu,Janet Jackson,Jenny Cavnar,Thomas Harding,Walt Wiess", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "On the Rox", "description": "Two crucial Rockies topics.
