Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Giuliani praised Lynch\u2019s record as a U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York and says the president deserves to have his pick of nominees, even if he disagrees with some of her views. And he urged Graham, who plans to vote for Lynch\u2019s confirmation, to circulate the letter to fellow senators.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cHow we treat nominees like Ms. Lynch has important constitutional implications,\u201d Giuliani says in the Monday letter, which was provided to POLITICO. \u201cThe scope and the breadth of the advice and consent function of the U.S. Senate has been much debated. My interpretation has always been that a president should be given the deference to choose his Cabinet unless the nominee is unqualified to do the job, has a history of unethical behavior or is so ideologically rigid as to be incapable of making rational choices in the public interest.\u201d\n\n\u201cNone of these disqualifiers apply here,\u201d Giuliani concluded.\n\nGiuliani has expressed support for Lynch in the past, but his renewed effort comes at a critical juncture. The Obama administration is running into roadblocks trying to get Lynch confirmed. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has called on Democrats to let an unrelated anti-human trafficking bill pass before he\u2019ll put her up to a vote.\n\nMoreover, most senators in the 54-member Senate GOP Conference are prepared to block her, largely over her support of Obama\u2019s use of executive power to defer deportations and provide work permits for several million undocumented immigrants. That means Democrats will need at least four GOP senators to cross the aisle and back her nomination to replace Eric Holder as the top official at the Justice Department.\n\nIn addition to Graham, Democrats seem to have enough support \u2014 but barely. Other GOP backers include Sens. Orrin Hatch of Utah, Jeff Flake of Arizona and Susan Collins of Maine.\n\nGiuliani\u2019s backing could be helpful for Graham in particular. The South Carolina Republican, who is actively considering a run for the GOP presidential nomination next year, could use the letter to push back against any anger over his support of Lynch.\n\nGiuliani, the tough-talking, post-9/11 mayor, recently made headlines for questioning whether Obama loves the United States. Graham and Giuliani discussed Lynch in a private phone call Sunday.\n\n\u201cLike you, I have some ideological differences with her, and if there was a Republican president, we would be supporting someone closer to our shared political viewpoint,\u201d Giuliani said. \u201cHowever under the present circumstances, I would vote to confirm her if I were a member of the Senate regardless of my political affiliation.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "His renewed effort comes at a critical juncture.", "title": "Giuliani steps up lobbying for Lynch", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/03/rudy-giuliani-loretta-lynch-support-116154.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/02/18/150218_rudy_giuliani_ap_1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Congress,Senate,Justice Department,Lindsey Graham,Loretta Lynch,Rudy Giuliani", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "His renewed effort comes at a critical juncture.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Giuliani has expressed support for Lynch in the past, but his renewed effort comes at a critical juncture.\nStory Continued Below\u201cHow we treat nominees like Ms. Lynch has important constitutional implications,\u201d Giuliani says in the Monday letter, which was provided to POLITICO.\nGiuliani steps up lobbying for Lynch His support offers cover for wavering Republicans as nomination remains in limboFormer New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani is stepping up his lobbying for Loretta Lynch\u2019s confirmation as attorney general, a move that could give political cover to fence-sitting Republicans who are weighing whether to block the nominee.\nGraham and Giuliani discussed Lynch in a private phone call Sunday.\n\u201cLike you, I have some ideological differences with her, and if there was a Republican president, we would be supporting someone closer to our shared political viewpoint,\u201d Giuliani said."}
