Robert Menendez (D-NJ) on political corruption charges last week is having an important ripple effect as Congress positions itself to respond to the Obama administration\u2019s tentative deal with Iran to restrict its nuclear program.\n\nChair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee before the GOP takeover of Congress in January, Menendez stepped down as that committee\u2019s ranking member. He did so after he was criminally charged with swapping political favors with a Florida eye surgeon in return for luxurious gifts and trips.\n\nRelated: Cardin Replaces Menendez in U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Post\n\nThis is a mixed blessing for Obama. He loses a battle-tested lawmaker who championed immigration reform and other administration priorities. Menendez, however, also sharply disagreed with Obama about the direction of the nuclear talks with Iran and on normalizing diplomatic and trade relations with Cuba.\n\nThe N.J. Democrat has been closely allied with Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN), the new chair of the Foreign Relations Committee, in pressing for bipartisan legislation to preserve or even add to the sanctions if Congress disapproves of the final Iran nukes deal. A deal could be reached by early summer.\n\nThe Foreign Relations Committee is scheduled to take up legislation on April 14 when Congress returns from its two-week break. The legislation would withhold sanction relief for the Iranians under a final agreement and lawmakers have 60 days to review and vote on the final agreement.\n\nObama promised to brief and closely consult with lawmakers on the Iran agreement that was negotiated by Secretary of State John Kerry and European and Russian diplomats. However, administration officials reportedly believe Congress has no formal role in approving the final deal.\n\nRelated: Republicans Are Playing the Overreach Game on Foreign Policy\n\nObama announced the preliminary agreement in the Rose Garden and warned lawmakers that opposition to a compromise forged after two years of intense negotiations could risk war down the road. \u201cIf Congress kills this deal \u2013 not based on expert analysis, and without offering any reasonable alternative \u2013 then it\u2019s the United States that will be blamed for the failure of diplomacy,\u201d Obama said. \u201cInternational unity will collapse, and the path to conflict will widen.\u201d\n\nWith Menendez sidelined by the charges against him, Sen. Ben Cardin (D-MD), a liberal Democrat and close ally of the administration, has been elevated by his party\u2019s leadership. He is now the ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee. Cardin \u2013 a former U.S. House member \u2013 is a consummate dealmaker and strong advocate of many of Obama\u2019s economic and foreign policy priorities.\n\nCardin, 71 said Thursday he wanted unanimity in Congress in terms of the final deal with Iran. He also said that aspects of the Corker-Menendez bill would have to be toned down.\n\nRelated: Hillary Clinton Blasts Republicans over Iran Nuclear Letter\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important that we work as hard as possible for unity to give this country the strongest possible position in foreign policy,\u201d Cardin told CQ Roll Call. The low-key Maryland Democrat said he\u2019s always supported a congressional review of the nuclear deal.\n\nUnder the preliminary framework, Iran will reduce its centrifuges, restrict uranium enrichment for 15 years, cut its current stockpile of low-enriched uranium, and not build any new enrichment facilities during that period. The International Atomic Energy Agency would be granted access to all sites to confirm past and present activities.\n\nThese and other restrictions would produce a one-year breakout period. This means that if Iran later defaults on the deal, it would take its government at least a year to produce enough material to build one nuclear weapon compared with the current estimates of two to three months.\n\nIn return for these concessions, many economic sanctions that the U.S. and its allies have imposed on Iran\u2019s economy would be suspended, rather than permanently lifted. Those sanctions could \u201csnap back\u201d if Iran were found to be cheating on the agreement.\n\nRelated: Republicans Rip into Iran Nuke Deal on Twitter\n\nThe early response from Capitol Hill was largely predictable, with many Republicans denouncing the agreement as a dangerous sellout. They say \u2013 as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insists \u2013 it would pave the way for Iran to develop nuclear weapons that could be used against Israel.\n\nSen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) said the administration has signed off on a list of dangerous concessions that could put \u201cIran on the path to nuclear weapons.\u201d Sen. Mark Kirk (R-IL) charged the administration with appeasement. He said, \u201cNeville Chamberlin got a better deal from Adolph Hitler\u201d than Kerry and other U.S. officials negotiated with the Iranians.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner (R-OH), who led a Republican delegation to Israel last week, called the agreement an \u201calarming departure\u201d from Obama\u2019s initial goals. He said Congress must fully review the deal before sanctions on Iran are lifted.\n\nRelated: Boehner, Heading to Israel, Slams Obama\u2019s Treatment of Netanyahu\n\nDemocrats were more temperate, although a few praised Obama for a major foreign policy breakthrough. Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-OR) hailed the deal as setting the stage \u201cfor a paradigm shift in the country and in the region.\u201d\n\nCardin said he would need to examine the preliminary and final agreement before reaching a judgment. He said he would focus on how long it would take Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon if it violated the deal and the extent of verification requirement. \u201cThe administration will never agree Congress should have a role,\u201d Cardin told CQ Roll Call. \u201cThere is going to be a philosophical difference, but we have to make sure whatever we do is constructive for the president in negotiating.\u201d\n\nAs for Boehner, he said, \u201cIn the weeks ahead Republicans and Democrats in Congress will continue to press this administration on the details of these parameters and the tough questions that remain unanswered.\"\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The indictment of Sen.", "title": "Menendez Indictment May Help Obama in Iran Nuke Deal", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/05/Menendez-Indictment-May-Help-Obama-Iran-Nuke-Deal", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-justice-menendez_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/05/Menendez-Indictment-May-Help-Obama-Iran-Nuke-Deal", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-justice-menendez_2.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The indictment of Sen.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb8f2\"", "article_summary": "The legislation would withhold sanction relief for the Iranians under a final agreement and lawmakers have 60 days to review and vote on the final agreement.\nRelated: Cardin Replaces Menendez in U.S. Senate Foreign Relations PostThis is a mixed blessing for Obama.\nObama promised to brief and closely consult with lawmakers on the Iran agreement that was negotiated by Secretary of State John Kerry and European and Russian diplomats.\nCardin, 71 said Thursday he wanted unanimity in Congress in terms of the final deal with Iran.\nThe low-key Maryland Democrat said he\u2019s always supported a congressional review of the nuclear deal."}
