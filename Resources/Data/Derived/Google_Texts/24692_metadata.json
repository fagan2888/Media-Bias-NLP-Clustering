Everyone, shield your precious Internet eyes, it\u2019s #TheDress all over again. You ready?\n\nPeople couldn\u2019t decide \u2014 the one on the left, the one on the right, maybe both? Before you knew it, #TheShoe was trending. The slew of responses certainly surprised Munro, who told Newsy she was just hoping for a few opinions.\n\nRight. So let\u2019s figure out the colors here since that seems to be the crux of the issue.\n\nFirst, the shoe itself. It\u2019s from BCBG, and is listed as the color \u201cMagenta\u201d at least at one retail outlet.\n\nAs for the polishes, Munro sent Newsy a photo and, well, uh, as it turns out, both are labeled as the \u201cDream On\u201d color. She also said both are from the nail polish company, SinfulColors.\n\nChecking out their website doesn\u2019t do us much good. They only have one product labeled as \u201cDream On,\u201d which they say is purple.\n\nEven more confusing, Kmart lists a reddish-looking polish as the \u201cDream On\u201d label. Though Walmart matches what SinfulColors itself shows.\n\nBoth news outlets and the denizens of social media have compared it to that whole #TheDress debacle that melted the Internet in February.\n\nWhile we kind of see where they\u2019re coming from, we\u2019re not sure it\u2019s that much of an optical illusion.\n\nI mean, look. We\u2019re talking about deciding between two different colors of nail polish here and a magenta shoe. It\u2019s not the same optic science that Wired had to break down for everyone back in February.\n\nThough hey, maybe it is \u2014 after more than 6,500 retweets, there still doesn\u2019t seem to be a definitive consensus on which polish to use.\n\nAdd to that the fact the Internet was NOT helpful and Munro says she still hasn\u2019t decided what color to use.\n\nThis video includes images from Ava Munro and music from Bensound / CC BY 3.0.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Folks on Twitter are debating which nail polish a woman should use to match her shoes \u2014 apparently it's not as simple as it sounds.", "og": {"site_name": "Newsy", "description": "Folks on Twitter are debating which nail polish a woman should use to match her shoes \u2014 apparently it's not as simple as it sounds.", "title": "Twitter Nail Polish Debate Goes Viral: Welcome To #TheShoe", "url": "http://www.newsy.com/videos/twitter-nail-polish-debate-goes-viral-welcome-to-theshoe/", "image": "http://newsymain.npgroup.netdna-cdn.com/images/videos/m/1436533877.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Folks on Twitter are debating which nail polish a woman should use to match her shoes \u2014 apparently it's not as simple as it sounds.", "title": "Twitter Nail Polish Debate Goes Viral: Welcome To #TheShoe", "url": "https://www.newsy.com/videos/twitter-nail-polish-debate-goes-viral-welcome-to-theshoe/", "image": "https://newsymain-npgroup.netdna-ssl.com/images/videos/m/1436533877.png", "site": "@newsyvideos", "player": {"width": 400, "identifier": "https://player.ooyala.com/tframe.html?embedCode=01d3g0djpOkWVEMM1dSwz7bO2h0gBoxY&pbid=54ea1c2f14ee44369ddf31ac887ffe7e", "height": 225}, "app": {"url": {"ipad": "newsy://49021", "iphone": "newsy://49021", "googleplay": "com.newsy"}, "name": {"ipad": "Newsy: Video News", "iphone": "Newsy: Video News", "googleplay": "Newsy: Multisource Video News"}, "id": {"ipad": 330879884, "iphone": 330879884, "googleplay": "com.newsy"}}, "card": "player"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "newsy://49021", "app_store_id": 330879884, "app_name": "Newsy: Video News"}}, "msvalidate.01": "675C8D40A5F1E0722AA2D3A33379E884", "fb": {"app_id": 380870506022, "pages": 49978948774}, "google-site-verification": "o36fft0HATmhbZ_GPX4YSOS3EmkTGkPrvNFxQwzcNbY", "keywords": "#theshoe,#thedress,the shoe,the dress,the shoe twitter,shoe polish twitter,the shoe nail polish,nail polish twitter,polish twitter,nail polish twitter shoe viral,the shoe viral,nail polish viral,twitter viral,weird news,viral news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newsyvideos"}, "thumbnail": "http://newsymain.npgroup.netdna-cdn.com/images/videos/m/1436533877.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9907\"", "article_summary": "Ava Munro, who uses the Twitter handle @totallymendes, tweeted to her followers a simple question \u2014 which nail polish fits her shoe better?\nFolks on Twitter are debating which nail polish a woman should use to match her shoes \u2014 apparently it's not as simple as it sounds.\nShe also said both are from the nail polish company, SinfulColors.\nWe\u2019re talking about deciding between two different colors of nail polish here and a magenta shoe.\nSo there\u2019s this shoe\u2026\u201cGet ready, the newest Internet debate is here and it\u2019s mind blowing,\u201d said a KCEN anchor."}
