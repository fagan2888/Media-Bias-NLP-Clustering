Burwell, addressing whether the Affordable Care Act authorizes the federal government to pay subsidies to those Americans purchasing healthcare through the federal exchange (healthcare.gov), is coming soon.\n\nThe plain language of the law says subsidies can be made for those who purchase healthcare insurance in an \u201cexchange established by the state.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nThirty-four states do not have state exchanges, so residents in those states who wish to purchase health insurance and obtain subsidies have used the federal exchange.\n\nRegarding the upcoming decision, the president said: \u201cI think it\u2019s important for us to assume that the Supreme Court is going to do what most legal scholars who have looked at this would expect them to do.\u201d\n\nThe courts decision is \u201cnot something that should be done based on a twisted interpretation of four words, and so I am optimistic that the Supreme Court will play it straight, when it comes to the interpretation,\u201d he added. \u201cThis should be an easy case. Frankly, it probably shouldn\u2019t even have been taken up.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\n\u201cI watch him as he said this, and I was astounded by his lack of sense of decency and comity,\u201d Napolitano told Fox News\u2019 Megyn Kelly. The justices \u201ccouldn\u2019t care less what he says. He\u2019s wrong that legal scholars are on his side. Legal scholars are on both sides and the Supreme Court does not count noses among legal scholars.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe can\u2019t intimidate them. He can\u2019t change their minds. He had his facts wrong. It\u2019s totally inappropriate for the president to do that,\u201d he added.\n\nKelly asked the judge: \u201cYou know the legal scholar who agrees with the challengers in the case? Jonathan Gruber, the MIT adviser to the White House, is on the record saying, \u2018This law is going to fail because they did not write it the right way.'\u201d\n\nThe Fox News host then noted that the president likes \u201cto bully the Supreme Court. Remember the State of the Union?\u201d referring to Obama calling out the Supreme Court regarding its decision in the Citizens United case. Obama\u2019s accusation during the address, implying the justices failed to follow the Constitution, prompted Justice Alito to mouth the words, \u201cNot true\u201d in response.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nSome have speculated the reason the White House has indicated it has no \u201cplan B\u201d if the Supreme Court rules against use of the federal exchange is to pressure the justices to rule in its favor. Chief Justice John Roberts reportedly switched his vote at the last minute in ruling on the constitutionality of Obamacare in 2012 after the administration employed similar pressure tactics.\n\nNapolitano told Kelly that the president\u2019s answer regarding his views about the impending decision should have been: \u201cThe case is before the court; and however the court rules, I will abide by that ruling.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd we will respect the rule of law,\u201d Kelly chimed in.\n\n\u201cIt tells me that he thinks he\u2019s going to lose, and he\u2019s trying to downplay the significance of that loss and disrespect the court,\u201d the judge said.\n\nHe then turned to the camera. \u201cGuess what Mr. President, the Supreme Court and not the president has the final word on the meaning of the law and its consistency with the Constitution. That\u2019s been the law of the land for 230 years.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"It's totally inappropriate for the president to do that.\"", "author": "Randy DeSoto", "og": {"site_name": "Western Journalism", "description": "\"It's totally inappropriate for the president to do that.\"", "title": "Watch: Judge Napolitano Wakes Obama Up With Harsh News He Didn't Want To Hear", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 2560, "identifier": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Judge-Napolitano-Obama1.jpg", "height": 1440}, "updated_time": "2015-06-13T01:36:07-07:00", "url": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/watch-judge-napolitano-wakes-obama-up-with-harsh-news-he-didnt-want-to-hear/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"It's totally inappropriate for the president to do that.\"", "creator": "@WestJournalism", "image": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Judge-Napolitano-Obama1.jpg", "title": "Watch: Judge Napolitano Wakes Obama Up With Harsh News He Didn't Want To Hear", "site": "@WestJournalism", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2015-06-09T18:21:05-07:00", "fb": {"app_id": 275784739127435, "pages": 123624513983}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/android-chrome-192x192.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WesternJournalism", "section": "Expose Obama", "tag": "Supreme Court", "published_time": "2015-06-09T18:21:05-07:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-13T01:36:07-07:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "king v. burwell, , andrew napolitano, barack obama, constitution, megyn kelly, obamacare, supreme court, politics, nation, religion"}, "article_summary": "Legal scholars are on both sides and the Supreme Court does not count noses among legal scholars.\u201d\u201cHe can\u2019t intimidate them.\nRemember the State of the Union?\u201d referring to Obama calling out the Supreme Court regarding its decision in the Citizens United case.\n'\u201dThe Fox News host then noted that the president likes \u201cto bully the Supreme Court.\nAdvertisement - story continues belowJudge Andrew Napolitano chastised President Barack Obama for his \u201clack of a sense of decency\u201d for trying to pressure Supreme Court justices to decide the impending Obamacare decision in his favor.\n\u201cGuess what Mr. President, the Supreme Court and not the president has the final word on the meaning of the law and its consistency with the Constitution."}
