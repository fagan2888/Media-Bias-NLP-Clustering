Clearly, something major is happening here \u2014 the Democrat Party is essentially becoming the Socialist Party, while most of the GOP establishment settles for socialism lite. And except among the Republican base, some independents, and so-called \u201cblue-dog Democrats,\u201d much of the public seems fine with it all. That should trouble anyone who values liberty or the U.S. Constitution.\n\nAs recent events show clearly, the Democrat primary is fast becoming a race to the far-left extreme. In fact, the platforms of both Clinton and Sanders are much more in line with Karl Marx\u2019s ten planks of the Communist Manifesto than with the U.S. Constitution \u2014 and just one long-shot Democrat 2016 contender so far has had the courage to call out the radical leftist extremism coming from the party\u2019s two leading candidates. Yet, the self-styled Socialist from Vermont, despite bragging about his plans to confiscate and redistribute even more wealth while nationalizing wide swaths of what remains of the embattled economy, is still surging ahead. Some analysts are now even saying he might win the nomination.\n\nApparently many Democrat voters never had a real history lesson on the horrors of socialism, or an economics lesson on the inevitable failures, misery, and death produced by central planning. Indeed, despite advocating for a philosophy that has resulted in at least a hundred million deaths over the last century alone, Sanders even appears to have real grassroots support \u2014 at least in statist strongholds \u2014 and has drawn the largest audiences so far this campaign season. Almost 30,000 people came out in Portland, Oregon, to see him speak, for example, followed by another nearly 30,000-strong crowd in Los Angeles. Some 15,000 went to watch Sanders speak in Seattle. And in New Hampshire, a recent poll shows Sanders rocketing ahead, with support from 44 percent of likely Democrat primary voters versus 37 percent for Clinton.\n\nJust one Democrat candidate in the 2016 race has even mentioned the radical shift of Democrat politicians to the socialist extreme. \u201cThe party has moved way far to the left, and that\u2019s not my Democratic Party,\u201d said Jim Webb, a former Democrat U.S. Senator representing Virginia, during an interview on Fox News. \u201cWe need to bring working people back into the formula.\u201d Polls put Webb's support at between one and two percent so far, and virtually nobody sees a credible path for the ex-senator to secure the 2016 Democrat nomination in the face of the Sanders and Clinton juggernauts.\n\nAnd yet, despite his harsh words about his party, Webb is hardly an advocate of small government, the Constitution, or moderation of any sort. He has supported, among other Big Government lawlessness, federal funding for abortionists, brutal UN population control policies, government \u201cstimulus\u201d of the economy, homosexual \u201cmarriage,\u201d EPA regulation of CO2 (the gas you exhale), cap and trade, amnesty for illegal immigrants, higher taxes, more spending, ObamaCare, and much more. Less than a generation ago, his positions would have been considered on the extreme fringe of the fringe even among Democrats. Today, Webb is the \u201cmoderate\u201d in the 2016 Democrat race.\n\nAs if more evidence of the Democrat Party's increasingly open shift to becoming America's proud socialist party was needed, DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, who called Sanders a \u201cgood Democrat,\u201d apparently does not know what distinguishes the views of the party she ostensibly leads from socialism. In late July, ultra-left MSNBC host Chris Matthews asked the congresswoman: \u201cWhat\u2019s the difference between a Democrat and a socialist? I used to think there was a big difference. What do you think it is?\u201d\n\nUnsurprisingly, like a good politician, she avoided the question. \u201cThe more important question is what's the difference between being a Democrat and being a Republican,\u201d Wasserman-Schultz responded, without really explaining what that alleged difference might be. But Matthews was persistent. \u201cYou\u2019re the chairman of the Democratic Party,\u201d he said. \u201cTell me what\u2019s the difference between you and a socialist.\u201d Wasserman-Schultz again went back to the alleged differences between the GOP and Democrats without ever answering the question, claiming falsely that Republicans might phase out Medicare when she knows as well as anybody that no establishment Republican would even think about that.\n\nThe reason Wasserman-Schultz failed to answer the simple question is almost certainly because there is, essentially, zero difference between socialists and the Democrat Party today, except the name perhaps. In fact, earlier this year, Communist Party USA boss John Bachtell boasted in a column that his Marxist-Leninist organization, a tentacle of the murderous Soviet regime in America for decades, \u201cutilizes\u201d the increasingly radical Democratic Party to advance its totalitarian objectives in the United States. Writing in the Communist Party propaganda mouthpiece People\u2019s World, Bachtell said fending off what he calls the \u201cultra-right\u201d \u2014 essentially anyone to the right of Obama, whom American communists openly backed in both elections \u2014 requires the CPUSA to continue utilizing the Democrat Party as a \u201cvehicle.\u201d\n\nOutside analysts are starting to notice the trend, too. \u201cIf the Democratic Party once felt the need to distinguish itself from socialism, that no longer seems to be the case,\u201d wrote Jason Riley, a Manhattan Institute senior fellow and author of Please Stop Helping Us: How Liberals Make It Harder for Blacks to Succeed. \u201c[Sanders] may have an affinity for a political ideology that has given the world everything from the Soviet Gulag to modern-day Greece, but in this age of Obama, the senator is just another liberal with a statist agenda.\u201d\n\nOf course, part of Sanders' meteoric rise from cooky socialist nobody to leading 2016 contender can likely be explained by the fact that the establishment has been promoting Clinton as the presumptive nominee. Less than half of Americans trust her, according to polls, and she is currently being swamped with perpetually expanding scandals \u2014 Benghazi, e-mails, investigations, and more.\n\nBut there is another crucial factor as well: A sizable segment of the American public was betrayed by its government \u201ceducators\u201d and its \u201cnews\u201d providers, which have systematically worked to obscure the long and brutal history of socialism in the world. Whether it was Adolf Hitler's \u201cNational Socialist\u201d (Nazi) party or Stalin and Mao's international brand of socialist terror, the fruit of socialism everywhere and always has been death, oppression, tyranny, mass-murder, starvation, and destruction. Yet, according to polls, almost half of Americans today would vote for a socialist candidate.\n\nMeanwhile, establishment Republicans touted by the media as \u201cmoderate\u201d are moving further and further to the left. George W. Bush and his wildly mischaracterized \u201ccompassionate conservatism,\u201d for example, saw a massive expansion of the cost and power of the federal government. His brother Jeb Bush, meanwhile, currently touted as a \u201cfrontrunner\u201d by the establishment for the 2016 GOP nomination, continues to support the nationalization of education via Common Core and virtually every Big Government program in existence today. Ohio Governor John Kasich is even running for the nomination on a \u201ccompassionate conservative\u201d Big Government platform, and Donald Trump, the leading contender in polls, has a long history of advocacy on behalf of Big Government and even Democrat politicians.\n\nThe United States has already traveled a long way down the road to socialism outlined by Karl Marx in the infamous Communist Manifesto, as Charles Scaliger documented in a comprehensive 2014 article on the subject for this magazine. Progressive income taxes, central bank monopoly on currency and credit, and government schools are just some of the hallmarks. A brief perusal of Communist Goals, as entered into the congressional record in 1963, reveals that many of them are now official federal policy broadly accepted by both major parties. Under Obama, those trends toward tyranny have been accelerating.\n\nAmerica is currently witnessing the Democrat Party drop the mask as it goes full socialist. And with the GOP establishment drifting further and further to the lawless left, broader and broader swaths of middle, mainstream America are increasingly being demonized by their government, the bipartisan establishment, and its propaganda organs as \u201cextremist\u201d merely for opposing the dangerous extremism coming out of the federal government. The irony, of course, is that the establishment is extremist by any objective measure.\n\nIt is time for the American people to wake up while they still have the ability to stop totalitarianism in its tracks. Sanders' and Clinton's Democrat Party may be too far gone, but the Constitution can still guide America back to its foundations of liberty, God-given rights, and limited government.\n\nPhoto of Sen.
