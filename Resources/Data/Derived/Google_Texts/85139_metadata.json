Particularly longstanding deals with a single station, as in the case of KMGH, some decades, have resulted in exorbitant licensing fees. Word is Gannett\u2019s KTVD was in the bidding as well as KDVR, and the deal was set at roughly $30,000 a week. (Note, during political ad season, the station will more than make up the costs in advertising. Candidates and causes in Colorado are kicking in as much as $3,000 per 30-second spot during the daytime syndicated hits.)\n\nThe addition of these syndicated shows marks a shift in direction for Fox31, which presented itself as the younger, edgier, indie alternative to the mainstream network affiliates. Now, it will have older-skewing game shows \u2014 including \u201cCelebrity Name Game,\u201d the Craig Ferguson show in which Tribune has part ownership, \u201cHot Bench,\u201d another courtroom show, and \u201cJudge Judy.\u201d\n\nThe younger, edgier holdout in syndication: look for reruns of \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d weeknights at 11 and 11:30 p.m. on Fox31.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Fox31,Jeopardy!,KMGH,newscast,syndication,tv,Wheel of Fortune", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "Ostrow Off The Record", "description": "Fans of \"Wheel of Fortune\" and \"Jeopardy!\" won't have to change their schedules -- only their channels -- when the syndicated hits move to Fox31 on Sept. 8.\r\n\r\n\"Jeopardy\" will continue weeknights at 6 p.m., \"Wheel\" at 6:30 p.m., with a second run for \"Jeopardy\" at noon weekdays and 10 p.m. Saturdays on KDVR. \"Wheel\" will have an additional run at 11:30 p.m. Sundays.", "title": "\"Jeopardy!\" and \"Wheel of Fortune\" land at Fox31", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/ostrow/2014/08/27/jeopardy-wheel-fortune-land-fox31-sept-8/19767/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/ostrow/files/2014/08/wheel.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Fans of \"Wheel of Fortune\" and \"Jeopardy!\" won't have to change their schedules -- only their channels -- when the syndicated hits move to Fox31 on Sept. 8.\r\n\r\n\"Jeopardy\" will continue weeknights at 6 p.m., \"Wheel\" at 6:30 p.m., with a second run for \"Jeopardy\" at noon weekdays and 10 p.m. Saturdays on KDVR. \"Wheel\" will have an additional run at 11:30 p.m. Sundays.", "creator": "@ostrowdp", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/ostrow/2014/08/27/jeopardy-wheel-fortune-land-fox31-sept-8/19767/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/ostrow/files/2014/08/wheel.jpg", "title": "\u201cJeopardy!\u201d and \u201cWheel of Fortune\u201d land at Fox31 Sept. 8", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "After decades in one spot, \"Jeopardy!\" and \"Wheel of Fortune\" switch from KMGH to KDVR on Sept. 8"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdce14\"", "article_summary": "Fans of \u201cWheel of Fortune\u201d and \u201cJeopardy!\u201d won\u2019t have to change their schedules \u2014 only their channels \u2014 when the syndicated hits move to Fox31 on Sept. 8.\n\u201cJeopardy\u201d will continue weeknights at 6 p.m., \u201cWheel\u201d at 6:30 p.m., with a second run for \u201cJeopardy\u201d at noon weekdays and 10 p.m. Saturdays on KDVR.\nThe addition of these syndicated shows marks a shift in direction for Fox31, which presented itself as the younger, edgier, indie alternative to the mainstream network affiliates.\n\u201cWheel\u201d will have an additional run at 11:30 p.m. Sundays.\nParticularly longstanding deals with a single station, as in the case of KMGH, some decades, have resulted in exorbitant licensing fees."}
