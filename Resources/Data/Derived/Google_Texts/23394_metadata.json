(AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster)\n\nSOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) \u2014 Small-business owners in Indiana say a federal proposal to increase the number of workers eligible for overtime pay could hurt their operations.\n\nPresident Barack Obama said Monday that he wants to raise the overtime threshold so that managerial employees earning up to about $50,000 a year are eligible for extra pay. The change would affect about 100,000 Indiana workers.\n\nIndiana Department of Workforce Development spokesman Joe Frank tells the South Bend Tribune that owners fear the change would make it too costly to do business or could force them to cut jobs.\n\nObama says the current overtime threshold undercuts the intent of the overtime law. The White House says the overtime rules covered 65 percent of salaried workers in 1975 but cover just 8 percent today.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\nMore\n\nPinterest\n\nLike this: Like Loading...", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Barack Obama said Monday that he wants to raise the overtime threshold.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=488524387", "og": {"site_name": "WISH-TV", "description": "President Barack Obama said Monday that he wants to raise the overtime threshold.", "title": "Obama overtime pay proposal raises concerns in Indiana", "url": "http://wishtv.com/2015/07/04/obama-overtime-pay-proposal-raises-concerns-in-indiana/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "https://lintvwish.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/contentidcf56845756b7691c7a0f6a706700bf1efmtjpgrolepreviewreldt2015-06-25t172610mediaphotorecordidba2414c502d24f7da71d5bd570a95ce5cloudfrontavailablefalseakamaiavailabletrueitemidba.jpg", "height": 365}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "President Barack Obama said Monday that he wants to raise the overtime threshold.", "creator": "@WISH_TV", "image": {"src": "https://lintvwish.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/contentidcf56845756b7691c7a0f6a706700bf1efmtjpgrolepreviewreldt2015-06-25t172610mediaphotorecordidba2414c502d24f7da71d5bd570a95ce5cloudfrontavailablefalseakamaiavailabletrueitemidba.jpg?w=640"}, "title": "Obama overtime pay proposal raises concerns in Indiana", "site": "wish_tv", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Barack Obama, Politics, South Bend - Indiana, St. Joseph County, Indiana News, News, Associated Press", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.linmedia.newstouch.wish", "fb": {"pages": 51020120862}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wishtv.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/3eda613633012e4513b3dffff2e4b0bc?s=16", "application-name": "WISH-TV", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wishtv", "published_time": "2015-07-04T13:43:37+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-05T11:35:07+00:00"}, "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "google-site-verification": "-0bIsWnsWP_Tti2P_v5CM_6E-Jif4gWmQWQHbxcE9q4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcadf1\"", "article_summary": "(AP) \u2014 Small-business owners in Indiana say a federal proposal to increase the number of workers eligible for overtime pay could hurt their operations.\nObama says the current overtime threshold undercuts the intent of the overtime law.\nPresident Barack Obama said Monday that he wants to raise the overtime threshold so that managerial employees earning up to about $50,000 a year are eligible for extra pay.\nThe change would affect about 100,000 Indiana workers.\nPresident Barack Obama speaks in the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington, Thursday, June 25, 2015, after the Supreme Court upheld the subsidies for customers in states that do not operate their own exchanges under President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act."}
