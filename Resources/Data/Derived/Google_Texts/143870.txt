PINE BLUFF, Ark -- Floods waters still have a tight grip on many areas in Central Arkansas.

Over in Pine Bluff, more than half Island Harbor is underwater due to the swelling, nearby, Arkansas River.

Fire Chief Wendy Emerson said there is only one word she can think of to describe the devastation.

"Unreal," said Emerson.

But she said it's become the norm when it rains hard.

"It's part of life on the river," said Emerson.

The scene is a near mirror image of the flooding event the city saw around May 2015.



"We don't expect it twice a year," said Emerson.

But this time she said the water is higher -- more roads, signs and homes, including her own, are overtaken by flood water.

"I've got about 23 inches of water in it right, maybe a little bit more," said Emerson.

Some people, whose homes are only surrounded by the high water, are sticking around, making the best of the situation. Others have abandoned ship.

"We had enough notice that people could get out before the water started coming up," said Emerson.

Boats are docked to the nearby levee, lined on top of it are cars of people who live in Island Harbor.

"All the neighbors check on each other, boat by and check on them," said Emerson.

Emerson said despite the headache the town goes through when it rains hard, there's no other place people would rather live.

"It's more like a family out here than it is anything. we all get together and if it wasn't flooded, we'd all be someone's house watching the game today," said Emerson.

Jefferson County has been declared a disaster area. Many people said they are anxious to get things fixed so they can get back to their normal lives.
