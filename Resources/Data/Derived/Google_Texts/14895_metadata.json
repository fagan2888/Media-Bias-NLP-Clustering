First, the theoretical question: What is the purpose of testing? Then the practical question: What happens to the information they study for a test after students have taken the test. My students\u2019 answers to both questions typically achieve virtual unanimity. The purpose of testing, they say, is to find out how much students have \u201clearned,\u201d which is to say, how much they \u201cknow.\u201d After they take the test, these same students testify, they forget virtually all of the information they \u201clearned\u201d for the test.\n\nIn the subsequent discussion, I ask them what their answers to these questions suggest about their experience in the public school system (only a tiny minority of Miami Dade College students having attended private schools). Did the tests they took achieve the purpose of revealing how much they had learned, how much they know, about the subjects on which they were tested? If they passed those tests (as they must have in that they had been allowed to continue their education) and yet had forgotten the information about the subjects on which they were tested, can they legitimately say that they \u201clearned\u201d that information, and as a result, that they now \u201cknow\u201d it? And if they didn\u2019t learn it and, as a result, don\u2019t know it, what was the outcome of their public education?\n\nThe answer is surely not that public school students don\u2019t learn anything. They do, after all, learn how to take tests. As standardized testing has swallowed up public education in the U.S. in the twenty-first century, its ravenous hunger intensifying yearly since the federal mandate inaugurated by President Bush\u2019s No Child Left Behind and perpetuated by President Obama\u2019s Race to the Top, students have largely become test-takers. As a result, their minds have been increasingly downsized to the mental equivalent of shrunken heads (trophies of the class warfare waged by the corporate interests who profit so handsomely from standardized testing).\n\nOf course, students have always had to take tests. But tests (i.e., multiple-choice, true-false, fill-in-the-blank) used to be simply one of the tools in the educational tool box. And the least effective tool when it came to assessing student learning. Tests were also the refuge of teachers who lacked the skills or the motivation, first, to engage students\u2019 interest in their subjects, opening their understanding and inspiring their imagination, and, second, to formulate meaningful ways to measure their students\u2019 learning. All teachers had to test their students, but for good teachers (of which there have always been many) testing was, at best, a necessary evil.\n\nThe limits of public education must be acknowledged if the most is to be made of it. One teacher per 20 (to 40 or more) students necessarily limits what teachers can accomplish in the best of systems. The educational ideal of the Socratic dialogue assumes an ongoing interaction, whatever the subject may be, between a teacher and a few students, who avail themselves of equal opportunity to question and challenge their teacher, who questions and challenges each student. And the teacher is able to continually assess the students\u2019 understanding of the subject matter based on what those students ask and answer. The classroom setting, by contrast, is an artificial learning environment that threatens to squelch curiosity by the sterility of its structure, and the teacher-to-student ratio typically precludes the kind of interactive dynamic that makes learning natural and lively. The best public school teachers have always found ways to mitigate and compensate for the limitations of the public school setting, but those limitations, nonetheless, remain. (And, as a result, education \u201creformers\u201d can always point to inadequacies and shortcomings, to whatever degree inescapable\u2014and to whatever degree typically exaggerated by would-be reformers\u2014when they have an innovation to push.) Testing has always seemed necessary to assess the learning of students whose numbers make it impossible for teachers to know them well enough to measure individually their knowledge of subjects.\n\nThe seeming necessity of testing, however, is the very fallacy that my students so faithfully pass on from their elders: that the purpose of testing is to assess student learning, to find out how much students know. If this is the purpose of testing, then testing must be pronounced an abject failure. If students, once tested, proceed to forget the lion\u2019s share of the information they \u201clearned\u201d for the test, then they did not, in fact, learn it and they do not, in fact, know it. (If you doubt that this is the case, ask yourself how much of what you \u201clearned\u201d in school you have retained in adulthood; the reality is that what you learned and, therefore, know, is not what you memorized for tests but, instead, what you understood and, as a result, continue to understand.) And if even the students who score highly on tests forget the information they \u201clearned\u201d for those tests, then they come away knowing little more than their low-scoring classmates.\n\nIn any case, the real purpose of testing in public education is not to assess student learning but to rank students themselves. Tests have always ranked students into \u201cwinners\u201d and \u201closers,\u201d \u201csuccesses\u201d and \u201cfailures.\u201dThe necessity of this was a function of twentieth-century American capitalism, which required that the \u201cpublic\u201d include enough \u201closers\u201d at the testing game to work the assembly lines of industry, as well as enough unemployed, would-be workers to threaten the job security of the employed (and so, keep them under the thumb of their employers. Unions mitigated this feature of capitalism for a time, to the benefit of all workers, which is why unions have been under assault by the corporate state and now struggle to survive).\n\nAt one time, testing was used to identify the losers so as to attempt to address their deficiencies and bring them over to the winning side. In the twenty-first century, however, the effect (function?) of standardized testing (in the wake of the off-shoring and technologizing of American manufacturing jobs) has been to overwhelm the public school system with losers at the testing game, launching them into a likely future of unemployment and, as a result in a growing number of (largely minority) cases, imprisonment (in the interest not only of limiting, if not eliminating, the possibility of social uprisings, and the accompanying threat to the private property of the corporate rich, but also of expanding the private, for-profit prison industry).\n\nThe primary reason that testing is, in truth, opposed to learning\u2014learning in the sense of acquiring knowledge through understanding\u2014is that when students regurgitate memorized information, they are unable to digest it\u2014that is, to process it into knowledge through understanding (just as the act of regurgitating food precludes the possibility that the body will digest that food). The very act of memorizing is a substitute for understanding, which is the key to retaining (as in learning) information. To memorize information for a test in order to repeat information on the test inevitably results in forgetting the information after the test. While students do not intentionally forget the information they regurgitate on tests, their minds reject it just as surely as physical regurgitation constitutes the body\u2019s rejection of food. Their minds reject/forget regurgitated information because the human mind does not learn that way. The human mind requires time (along with other readily available resources, none of which is allowed to interfere with the testing schedule) to process information into knowledge through understanding. And no other bridge exists between information and knowledge than understanding.\n\nBut it may be objected that standardized tests do not, as they are currently constructed, require students to memorize information. Instead, they largely test students\u2019 reading comprehension and composition skills (along with their mathematical skills), based on what students are supposed to already know. Aside from the fact that standardized tests often confront them with texts and topics about subjects that students know little to nothing about (because the specific subjects of those texts and topics have not been part of the curriculum), the main problem is that standardized testing has turned reading and writing into mere test-taking skills. The \u201creading\u201d that students are trained to do as test preparation is little more than skimming a passage in order to find answers to multiple-choice questions (and, as I repeatedly discover, they don\u2019t automatically switch from skimming to reading comprehension just because they have no multiple-choice questions to answer). And \u201cwriting\u201d has been reduced to rough-drafting, which is all students can do in the allotted time (the rough draft consisting of three points repeated incessantly in slighting different wordings until the time has expired). Consequently, reading comprehension and writing as the process of drafting, revising and editing are in danger of becoming lost arts. This is, perhaps, the major contribution of standardized testing to public education.\n\nPublic school teachers should not be blamed for this state of affairs. They are as equally victims of the system as their students. As long as students are tested, teachers will \u201cteach to the test,\u201d just as students will \u201cstudy\u201d for the test. (The verb \u201cstudy\u201d is used by virtually all students with reference not to pursuing their studies through reading and writing and thinking about subjects but, rather, to the activities of test preparation.) Students want to succeed, and teachers want their students to succeed, and academic success is, now more than ever, measured in terms of test scores. And thanks to Obama\u2019s Race to the Top regime (spearheaded by that colossal educational fraud, Arne Duncan), not only students\u2019 success but also teachers\u2019 success and, increasingly, their survival as teachers, depend on their students\u2019 test scores. Tests have always ranked students, but in the age of standardized testing, tests also rank not only public school teachers but public schools themselves (which risk closure if their students\u2019 test scores are persistently low enough) and nations as well (the U.S. ranking well down the list these days, indicating that American students are, generally speaking, not even learning to be proficient test-takers).\n\nA disturbing feature of the plethora of articles over the past few years that bemoan the arrival of the Common Core State Standards and their accompanying (allegedly new-and-improved) standardized tests is that the authors (regardless of whether they come from the political right or left) rarely fail to pledge allegiance to the necessity of standardized testing. They oppose the \u201chigh stakes\u201d\u2014for students, teachers and schools\u2014of standardized tests, the over-testing that crowds out instruction from the classroom, and the new non-age-appropriate and non-curriculum-aligned standardized tests that have been constructed to accompany the Common Core. Nevertheless, these writers seem nearly always to feel the need to clarify that they are not opposed to standardized testing itself, perhaps concluding (in compliance with the education reformers\u2019 agenda) that standardized testing is a given and can, therefore, at best be limited as to the havoc it wreaks. The reality is that, whatever the pros and cons of the Common Core itself, as long as its impact on students will be \u201cassessed\u201d by standardized tests, it will fail to educate them. In fact, the standardized tests themselves will constitute its primary impact on students.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Thanks to tests, my students' minds have been downsized -- while corporate interests profit.
