Jared Rowlinson said at a news conference.\n\n\u201cThere was a significant danger to the deputy as well as to the general public,\u201d Rowlinson said. \u201cWe\u2019re lucky that no officer was hit or injured in this incident.\u201d\n\nMeantime, a Lincoln County sheriff\u2019s deputy stopped an unrelated chase of a separate fleeing suspect on I-70 just east of Strasburg when that suspect approached the scene of the fatal shooting.\n\nThat suspect later crashed the car 19 miles away, fled on foot and hasn\u2019t been found.\n\nColorado State Patrol troopers were called at 6:26 a.m. about a silver sedan with New Mexico license plates that had crashed on westbound I-70 about 14 miles east of Strasburg, said Trooper Timothy Sutherland, a spokesman for CSP. Arapahoe County sheriff\u2019s deputies also responded to the scene.\n\nAt 7:20 a.m. a CSP trooper spotted a man walking beside the highway and stopped the patrol car. The man pulled out a handgun and ran into the middle of the highway in an attempt to flag people down, Rowlinson said.\n\nA Chevrolet Tahoe pulled over, and the suspect pointed a gun at the driver and a passenger and ordered them out of the SUV.\n\nThe suspect took the SUV and sped west. The trooper followed the man at speeds of more than 100 mph, Rowlinson said.\n\n\u201cShots were fired by the suspect during the chase,\u201d Sutherland said.\n\nState troopers deployed stop sticks on the highway. The sticks are studded with spikes to deflate car tires.\n\nOne of the SUV\u2019s tires was flattened. On three wheels, the suspect took the westbound Strasburg exit ramp.\n\nWhile still on the ramp, a trooper rammed the SUV, pushing it down an embankment.\n\n\u201cHe ran out into the field and fired shots at officers,\u201d Sutherland said.\n\nThe unnamed deputy returned fire and fatally shot the man, Rowlinson said.\n\nLaw enforcement officers from the Adams County Sheriff\u2019s Department and the Aurora Police Department also were involved in the case.\n\nThe suspect in the second car chase was driving a stolen brown Nissan, registered in Longmont, when the Lincoln County deputy began chasing the car.\n\nAt 8:09 a.m., the deputy stopped pursuing the stolen car 10 miles from Strasburg after clocking the vehicle at 118 mph.\n\nAuthorities believe a 27-year-old man named Adrian Charles Littlebear was driving the vehicle. Littlebear has not been found.\n\nLongmont police charged Littlebear with misdemeanor counts of child abuse on April 3 and violation of a restraining order on April 8.\n\nKirk Mitchell: 303-954-1206, denverpost.com/coldcases or twitter.com/kirkmitchell", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "A man was fatally shot following a high-speed chase on I-70", "title": "A man was fatally shot following a high-speed chase on I-70", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/06/06/a-man-was-fatally-shot-following-a-high-speed-chase-on-i-70/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-06T10:08:50+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-06T10:08:50+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Law enforcement officers from the Adams County Sheriff\u2019s Department and the Aurora Police Department also were involved in the case.\nThe unnamed deputy returned fire and fatally shot the man, Rowlinson said.\nArapahoe County sheriff\u2019s deputies also responded to the scene.\nThe Arapahoe County sheriff\u2019s deputy who fired the fatal gunshot has been placed on paid administrative leave pending completion of an investigation by the 18th Judicial District Critical Incident Team, Capt.\nThe suspect in the second car chase was driving a stolen brown Nissan, registered in Longmont, when the Lincoln County deputy began chasing the car."}
