Their unanimous vote, taken shortly before Thanksgiving, settled a civil-rights case that was to be heard today in the U.S. Supreme Court. In place of this morning\u2019s oral argument, you will hear\u2014if you listen closely\u2014a slow hissing of steam as it escapes from the ears of the conservative justices, who have just lost an opportunity to do to the Fair Housing Act of 1968 what they did, in the last term, to the Voting Rights Act of 1965: detach its teeth. It\u2019s no doubt a double disappointment, because the case also provided a chance to kick around Congress\u2014a pastime, and something of a project on the rightward reaches of the bench.\n\nMount Holly v. Mount Holly Gardens Citizens in Action concerned racial bias in housing policy\u2014specifically, the township\u2019s determination to redevelop a blighted community in such a way that the new homes would cost more than its poor, and mostly African-American and Latino, residents could afford. The case raised the question\u2014long thought settled\u2014of whether the Fair Housing Act bans policies that, however neutral on their face, disproportionately harm minorities. As a doctrine, this goes by the name of \u201cdisparate impact,\u201d and its importance to a wide range of civil-rights laws, from employment to education, indicates why the Court\u2019s conservatives seem so eager to introduce it to the business end of a gavel. (Last year a similar case, from St. Paul, was also settled on the eve of argument.)\n\nAs a group of former members of Congress argued in an amicus brief, a \u201cstraightforward reading\u201d of the Fair Housing Act\u2014both as it was passed in 1968 and as it was amended in 1988\u2014makes clear that disparate-impact claims were intended. If there were any doubt, such claims have been upheld in the appellate courts in all eleven circuits. Yet until the New Jersey settlement, the doctrine was looking pretty well doomed. Disparate-impact liability has long been a focus of conservatives\u2019 distaste for most civil-rights laws, and it maps neatly onto the right-leaning justices\u2019 unconcealed contempt for Congress: its practices, its prerogatives, its stated (or plainly apparent) intent. All this would surely have been on display in today\u2019s argument, just as it has been, consistently, in the arguments and opinions of the Roberts Court. \u201cOvert denigration\u201d is how one Supreme Court advocate described it to me.\n\nEarlier this year, Justice Antonin Scalia used the argument in Shelby County v. Holder, the voting-rights case, to revisit a favorite theme: that whatever the issue, members of Congress are driven only by the basest, most self-interested motives. To Scalia, the fact that the Senate, in 2006, voted 98 to 0 to extend key provisions of the Voting Rights Act for a quarter century was evidence only of cravenness. The higher the vote count, the greater skepticism it warrants. \u201cNot a single vote in the Senate against it,\u201d Scalia said in disbelief. \u201cAnd the House is pretty much the same I think it is attributable, very likely attributable, to a phenomenon that is called perpetuation of racial entitlement \u201d\n\n\u201cEven the name of it,\u201d he added, \u201cis wonderful: the Voting Rights Act. Who is going to vote against that in the future?\u201d\n\nPerhaps it\u2019s unreasonable to expect Supreme Court justices to hold Congress in higher regard than the rest of us do. President Obama\u2019s job-approval rating may have fallen to forty-one per cent in recent polls, but this is a number that Congress, mired in the single digits, can only dream of. Forty-one per-cent approval, for Congress, would be a national group hug. We hate Congress. It\u2019s what we do. Hating Congress is one of the few things we still do together, as one America, now that we no longer watch the same TV shows at the same time. Why should judges feel differently? During the October government shutdown, when Richard Kopf, a senior U.S. district-court judge, told Congress (on his blog) to \u201cgo to hell,\u201d comparing its members to a giant hot-air balloon named \u201cPigasus,\u201d wasn\u2019t he speaking for you and me?\n\nProbably so. But when judges carp about Congress, there is more to it than the common, throw-the-bums-out complaint. Judges like Kopf have a long list of institutional grievances against Congress, starting with sequestration, which cut three hundred and fifty million dollars from the judicial-branch budget, slashing operations\u2014federal marshals, courtroom security, public defenders, and mental-health screenings and drug testing of the accused and the convicted\u2014across the board. For conservative Supreme Court justices, meanwhile, an abhorrence of Congress reflects a knee-jerk distrust of the institution itself, its reach and its role in our democracy.\n\nIn Scalia\u2019s case, this is personal. It goes back to his time as an assistant attorney general in the Ford Administration and its battles over executive privilege and secrecy. \u201cIt was such a wounded and enfeebled Presidency, and Congress was just eating us alive ,\u201d Scalia recalled in a recent interview by Jennifer Senior of New York. \u201cIt was a time when people were talking about \u2018the imperial Presidency.\u2019 I knew very well that the 900-pound gorilla in Washington is not the Presidency. It\u2019s Congress. If Congress can get its act together, it can roll over the president. That\u2019s what the framers thought.\u201d And that, he said, \u201cwill be the source of tyranny.\u201d\n\nThe same sentiment permeates Chief Justice John Roberts\u2019 opinion, in 2012, on the Affordable Care Act. The Stanford law professor Pamela Karlan has described it as \u201cprobably the most grudging opinion ever to uphold a major piece of legislation,\u201d and that seems about right. While holding that the A.C.A. falls within the congressional power to tax, Roberts yanked it out of the scope of the Commerce Clause, echoing right-wing ruminations about federally mandated broccoli-eating, and citing James Madison\u2019s fear of a Congress \u201ceverywhere extending the sphere of its activity and drawing all power into its impetuous vortex.\u201d (One hopes the Chief\u2019s clerks confirmed that this line really is from The Federalist No. 48 and not from Disney\u2019s 1979 sci-fi thriller \u201cThe Black Hole.\u201d)\n\n\u201cIt is not our job,\u201d Roberts wrote in his haughtiest passage, \u201cto protect the people from the consequences of their political choices.\u201d But in the name of restraining Congress, his court is doing exactly that: second-guessing regulation of the health-insurance market (the A.C.A. opinion, which crippled Medicaid expansion), overriding ninety-eight senators\u2019 judgment that federal protection of the right to vote is still required (Shelby County), and perceiving, despite every expression of congressional intent, only naked self-interest behind campaign-finance reform (Citizens United and its progeny, McCutcheon v. F.E.C., argued in October).\n\n\u201cThe Roberts Court has lost faith in the democratic process,\u201d Professor Karlan wrote, noting that the conservative justices, at least in practice, reject the idea that the political branches have a \u201cspecial institutional competence\u201d in addressing certain questions. In his argument in the voting-rights case, Solicitor General Donald Verrilli tried this line, too, insisting on \u201cthe deference that Congress is owed because, frankly, of the superior institutional competence of Congress to make these kinds of judgments.\u201d This is probably a losing proposition on its face, unless one is talking about Congress\u2019s superior competence at walking in circles with its shoes tied together. But when the legislative branch is not only disrespected but disabled\u2014when the Court waves away the intent of Congress and takes away its tools to redress social and economic inequities\u2014then Congress may well go to hell, and we\u2019re going with it.\n\nJeff Shesol, a former speechwriter for President Clinton, is the author of \u201cSupreme Power: Franklin Roosevelt vs. the Supreme Court\u201d and is a partner at West Wing Writers.
