They say that history shows that compared to past presidents, Obama\u2019s approval ratings have moved in a very narrow range just below 50 percent. They attribute this to the fact that his ratings among both Democrats and Republicans have also barely budged.\n\nSome commentators have criticized the Obama administration for the amount of new rules and regulations that it has introduced, especially in recent months. The Hill\u2019s Congress blog defends what they say is \u2018Obama\u2019s regulatory flurry\u2019, arguing that in having a robust regulatory agenda in its final year, the administration is following a precedent set by past presidents. Obama has also gotten flak for being responsible for \u2018out of control\u2019 spending during his administration. Perrspectives says that these accusations are completely false; a new report from the Congressional Budget Office has found that the government is actually spending less than it was the day that President Obama took the oath of office in 2009.\n\nOn Thursday, PoliticusUSA has the news of a big win for Obama \u2013 a three-judge panel for the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit has denied an application which sought to stay the president\u2019s clean energy plan while it is under litigation.\n\nMoving on to the Republican Party, No More Mister Nice blog says that rather than destroying it, that New York billionaire Donald Trump may soon be the effective head of the GOP, and that the media seems to be in a state of denial about this fact. The \u2018establishment\u2019 wing of the Republican Party is increasingly concerned about the rise and popularity of Donald Trump, Texas Senator Ted Cruz and retired neurosurgeon, Dr Ben Carson. The Conscience of a Liberal comments this week that while some in the establishment camp think that there is a \u2018silent majority\u2019 of more practical Republicans, the fact that Trump, Carson and Cruz collectively have the support of two-thirds of primary voters would seem to refute that assumption.\n\n\n\nThe 2016 election\n\nPost Politics this week writes that the number of eligible Hispanic voters has now reached an all-time high, reaching 27.3 million, an increase of 4 million since 2012. Despite this large increase in population, they may not make a huge difference to the election: at 48 percent, Latino voters have a lower turnout rate than most other groups.\n\n\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 2016 campaign\n\nOn Sunday, Political Animal argues that vote-by-mail programs might be a key tactic for the Democratic Party to use to retake the House of Representatives. They say that a key problem for the party is turnout, and vote-by-mail voters are much more likely to vote compared to poll voters. In a longform piece, The American Prospect ponders whether the Democratic Party will be able to channel the discontent in the country into electoral victories by moving to the left, as much of its base has done.\n\n\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 4th debate\n\nOn Sunday evening the Democrats\u2019 presidential hopefuls squared off in the party\u2019s 4th debate in Charleston, South Carolina. Ahead of time, The Fix has the eight big issues in the debate, including Vermont Senator, Bernie Sanders\u2019 election viability, national security, and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s ties to Wall Street.\n\nIn their post-debate report, The Fix reports that Bernie Sanders was the winner, describing him as the \u2018prime mover\u2019 in the debate\u2019s first hour on most of the issues, and that Clinton was the loser because she did nothing to slow Sanders\u2019 momentum. The Atlantic says that Clinton and Sanders went \u2018to the mat\u2019 in South Carolina on the issues of gun control and health care. The Fix comments that there was a \u2018dark undercurrent\u2019 for Clinton in the debate \u2013 a list from Google showing trending questions during the debate were mostly quite hostile towards the former Secretary of State.\n\nTurning now to the candidates that duked it out on Sunday night:\n\nHillary Clinton\n\nHolding debates at the weekend were supposed to help Hillary Clinton \u2013 turns out the small audience this time around may hurt her (The Fix).\n\nIs Clinton (and the Democratic Party) in trouble? (Powerline).\n\nClinton \u2018hugged\u2019 President Obama\u2019s legacy during the debate \u2013 that may well work against her if the GOP uses her words in attack ads (The Fix)\n\nGiven Clinton\u2019s push to link herself closely to Obama, a Supreme Court ruling against the president\u2019s immigration actions could also puncture her campaign (The Atlantic)\n\nIn the early state of New Hampshire, Clinton is now polling 27 points behind Bernie Sanders (The Fix).\n\nA new report contends that Clinton\u2019s private email server \u2013 which she used while she was Secretary of State \u2013 contained information that was above \u2018Top Secret\u2019 (Outside the Beltway).\n\nBernie Sanders\n\nWith Iowa and New Hampshire around the corner, it\u2019s now or never for the Vermont Senator to become a bit more aggressive against Hillary Clinton (Townhall)\n\nWith a new ad out this week targeting Wall Street, Sanders may well be already going negative against Clinton (PoliticusUSA)\u2026\n\n\u2026and on Thursday the Sanders campaign called Clinton ally, David Brock, a \u2018mudslinger\u2019 for his criticism of Sanders\u2019 newest ad which shows mostly white people (Post Politics).\n\nA new poll shows that 43 percent of likely voters in Iowa would consider themselves to be socialist \u2013 maybe Sanders can win? (The Fix).\n\nWhether or not people in Iowa like the term, will calling him a \u2018socialist\u2019 elsewhere stop his rise? (The Atlantic).\n\nMillennials can\u2019t get enough of Bernie Sanders \u2013 they think that he\u2019s \u2018believable\u2019 (The Federalist).\n\nA Sanders nomination would actually help \u2013 not hurt \u2013 down ballot Democrats (Political Animal).\n\nOn healthcare, Sanders this week accused Clinton of \u2018sounding like a Republican\u2019. Sanders has a \u2018Medicare for all\u2019 policy which would replace Obamacare (PoliticusUSA).\n\nSanders still has a non-white voter problem (The Fix)\u2026\n\n\u2026 and a reparations problem as well (Wonkblog).\n\nIf he did win the nomination, would Sanders lose all 50 states as Ohio Governor, John Kasich claimed recently? (Political Animal).\n\nSanders apparently doesn\u2019t own a tuxedo \u2013 and that\u2019s quite telling (The Fix).\n\nBernie Sanders is in the big leagues now \u2013 and it means he\u2019s getting a lot of negative attention from the media and commentators (No More Mister Nice blog).\n\nSanders actually wants more media coverage \u2013 he should be careful what he wishes for (The Fix).\n\nmedia coverage \u2013 he should be careful what he wishes for (The Fix). Is the \u2018Bernie Bump\u2019 (or \u2018Sanders surge\u2019) actually real? (FiveThirtyEight).\n\nSanders drew criticism this week after claiming that Planned Parenthood and groups like it were part of \u2018the establishment\u2019 (The Fix).\n\nThe Republican Party\u2019s 2016 campaign\n\nWriting from the left, Political Animal reckons that we should celebrate the ascendancy of Ted Cruz and Donald Trump because it disempowers the moneyed conservatives who have tended to push the GOP\u2019s base in an angry direction, and because a Trump-Cruz power coalition is not likely to survive for very long. Roll Call\u2019s Rothenblog writes Tuesday that the rise of Ted Cruz on the right and Bernie Sanders on the left may be setting the election to be a \u2018Goldwater vs. McGovern\u2019 campaign. The Fix says that, at the moment, the GOP establishment would prefer a President Trump to a President Cruz. Why? Trump\u2019s more of an opportunist and wants to be liked, while Cruz doesn\u2019t care. Daily Kos reminds us that at this point not a single Governor or Senator has backed Ted Cruz or Donald Trump.\n\nIf Trump and Cruz do end up dominating the early primary states, we shouldn\u2019t be too worried \u2013 the way that the states award delegates makes it hard for any candidate to gain an early commanding lead, says FiveThirtyEight. Speaking of the GOP\u2019s early primaries, The Atlantic says that blue-collar conservatives may be critical in determining who comes out on top. Smart Politics meanwhile wonders if all six candidates might be able to reach ten percent in the upcoming New Hampshire primary. The Hill\u2019s Congress blog says that Cruz and Trump will have to break through South Carolina\u2019s firewall, if they want to really defeat the GOP establishment.\n\nLooking to Congress, Roll Call\u2019s At the Races has the news that for the National Republican Congressional Committee, 2015 had the best December for off-year funding, with $8.6 million brought in, giving the Committee $30.1 million cash in hand.\n\nMoving on to the GOP\u2019s field of presidential hopefuls:\n\nDonald Trump\n\nThe week began with Donald Trump accusing Ted Cruz of \u2018hypocrisy\u2019 over the latter\u2019s failure to disclose two-million dollar loans which helped fund his 2012 Senate campaign (Post Politics).\n\nHe also called Cruz a \u2018nasty guy\u2019, and said that no one likes him after Cruz doubled down on his criticism of Trump for having \u2018New York values\u2019 (Crooks & Liars).\n\nWhy the #NewYorkValues fight is a loser for Trump (The Federalist).\n\nThis week saw Trump\u2019s first attack ad against Cruz, accusing him of flip-flopping on immigration (Post Politics).\n\nCould Trump be considering a pro-abortion vice-presidential candidate in the form of former Massachusetts Senator Scott Brown? (Red State)\n\nTrump is apparently very unpopular with General Election voters (FiveThirtyEight)\u2026\n\n\u2026 though those that do support him won\u2019t leave him no matter what he does (Red State).\n\nWhy is Trump winning in New Hampshire? People there are more worried about illegal immigration than getting tax cuts (Wonkblog).\n\nTuesday sees the news that former Alaska Governor, and 2008 vice-presidential candidate, Sarah Palin, has endorsed Donald Trump. FiveThirtyEight reckons that Trump is actually Sarah Palin 2.0.\n\nPalin could potentially have a job in a Trump administration according to the man himself (Daily Kos).\n\nHow Donald Trump and Sarah Palin saved Hillary Clinton from a terrible news cycle this week (Red State).\n\nThe GOP sees black voters as the key to Donald Trump becoming president \u2013 though they don\u2019t think that he will garner much of their support (Daily Kos).\n\nThere\u2019s a massive gap between whites and Latinos in how they perceive Donald Trump (Monkey Cage).\n\nTrump has a China trade plan. Most of it is wrong (The Federalist).\n\nTed Cruz\n\nLast week\u2019s \u2018birther\u2019 controversy over Ted Cruz\u2019s Canadian origins spilled over into this one; Townhall says suggestions that Cruz isn\u2019t a \u2018natural born citizen\u2019 would also mean that the first eight presidents were also ineligible.\n\nWhy Cruz is correct about Trump\u2019s \u2018New York values\u2019 (The Federalist)\u2026\n\n\u2026and why that particular attack was a good strategic play against the New York billionaire (American Thinker).\n\nCruz also said this week that Donald Trump is \u2018nothing\u2019 like Ronald Reagan (Post Politics).\n\nHow the GOP establishment really, really, doesn\u2019t like Ted Cruz (The Fix)\u2026\n\n\u2026 and may even be ganging up on him (The Atlantic).\n\nWith the primary only weeks away, Cruz made a big push in New Hampshire this week with a five-day bus tour to all of the Granite State\u2019s ten counties (Red State).\n\nIowa\u2019s \u2018ethanol monster\u2019 has followed Cruz all the way to New Hampshire (Post Politics).\n\nMarco Rubio\n\nThe Florida Senator \u2018blew it\u2019 this week, stating that he would let illegal immigrants stay if they haven\u2019t committed major crimes (Red State).\n\nTen reasons to vote for Marco Rubio, including that he\u2019s the best chance to deliver Florida, and that he speaks Spanish fluently (American Thinker)\n\nRubio\u2019s recent push for young voters is wishful thinking (The Fix)\u2026\n\n\u2026and part of a \u2018dubious\u2019 campaign strategy (Outside the Beltway).\n\nHe\u2019s also having a \u2018nasty fight\u2019 for second place in New Hampshire (Daily Kos).\n\nJeb Bush\n\nIn a poll shocker, the former Florida governor is now leading Marco Rubio in South Carolina \u2013 though still in third place (Red State).\n\nChris Christie\n\nThe New Jersey Governor apparently has a plan to beat Trump (Daily Kos).\n\nChristie this week tried to capitalize on Ted Cruz\u2019s \u2018New York values\u2019 smear of Donald Trump (Crooks & Liars).\n\nThe rest\n\nOhio Governor, John Kasich has risen to second in a recent New Hampshire poll (Crooks & Liars).\n\nKentucky Senator Rand Paul needs to do well in Iowa on February 1 st if his campaign is to have any future (Hit & Run).\n\nif his campaign is to have any future (Hit & Run). Former Hewlett-Packard exec, Carly Fiorina this week got into hot water for using a group of young children at a right to life forum (Crooks & Liars).\n\nGovernment, the Beltway and Congress\u2019 agenda\n\nThis week the US Supreme Court agreed to take a case challenging president Obama\u2019s immigration program of \u2018deferred action\u2019 for the deportation of certain groups of illegal immigrants. The Atlantic says that the case may well become a constitutional one, with the potential to redefine the balance of power between Congress and the president. Monkey Cage writes that of the four questions that the Supreme Court has asked about Obama\u2019s immigration program, the last one \u2013 whether the guidance violates the \u2018Take Care Clause\u2019 of Article II of the Constitution \u2013 is the most important.\n\nOn Tuesday, The Daily Signal has five reasons why America is headed to a budget crisis, including that spending continues to \u2018skyrocket\u2019 and that a weak labor market is weighing down the economy.\n\nMoving on to Congress, The Fix looks at Speaker Paul Ryan\u2019s (R-WI) plan to get the House working again. They say that his two ideas \u2013 to give rank and file members more of a say, and to propose alternatives to Obama\u2019s policies \u2013 may actually be working against each other, as the latest Congressional GOP attempt to repeal Obamacare illustrates.\n\nHeading to the Senate, The Daily Signal writes this week that Senators should want to preserve the filibuster. They argue that eliminating the filibuster won\u2019t actually bring order to the Senate, and will enable favor-trading and backroom deals. Staying in the Senate, Roll Call\u2019s WGDB reports that the body rejected taking up a bill this week which would have enhanced screening for refugees after the Democratic and GOP Senate leaders failed to reach a deal on the bill\u2019s amendments.\n\n\n\nForeign policy, defense and trade\n\nOn Sunday, The Daily Signal comments on \u2018Implementation Day\u2019 \u2013 the day when Iran\u2019s sanctions have been lifted following last year\u2019s agreement with the P5+1. They say that the day is the point where Iran will regain assets worth nearly one third of its GDP, something that will have a major impact on the geopolitics of the region. Late last week also saw Iran and the US swap prisoners \u2013 Powerline says that the swap is another bad deal, but not a scandal, and that Donald Trump would have likely negotiated something more favorable. The Atlantic meanwhile examines the US-Iran conflict that never happened, writing that Obama has argued that the new dialogue with Iran is yielding near-term benefits and opportunities that isolating the country never did.\n\nOn Thursday, The Hill\u2019s Congress blog says that in the upcoming election, the \u2018hawks\u2019 will pay a political price for their calls for a more aggressive US foreign policy. They say that voters haven\u2019t forgotten the disastrous consequences of the Iraq war, and now want more diplomacy like that which produced the recent nuclear agreement with Iran.\n\nEarlier this month the drug kingpin Joaquin Guzman \u2013 also known as \u2018El Chapo\u2019 \u2013 was captured by Mexican authorities. Hit & Run say that El Chapo\u2019s capture will not reduce the flow of drugs into the US; now that\u2019s he\u2019s behind bars, the drug trade will get more lucrative and more dangerous.\n\nAmerican Thinker this week gives five reasons why the new(ish) F-35 fighter bomber are too dangerous to be flown including needing a very long runway to operate and a high hourly operating cost of $50,000.\n\n\n\nObamacare and health policy\n\nThis week saw debate over Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019 proposals for \u2018Medicare for all\u2019 to replace the current private insurance and Obamacare systems. The Conscience of a Liberal says that such single-payer plans are just not going to happen anytime soon, mostly because Americans aren\u2019t keen on healthcare rationing.\n\nRepublicans are also keen on healthcare reform, but most of their current focus is on repealing Obamacare. American Thinker writes that the question now for the right is what to replace Obamacare with. They argue that whatever the GOP does look to do, they shouldn\u2019t disrupt the current employer-based system, nor should they focus on covering the uninsured.\n\nThe Daily Signal says this week that Obamacare\u2019s special enrollment periods may well be driving up costs for customers. For the most part, consumers can only purchase coverage outside the November 1st to January 31st period in exceptional circumstances, but as many as ten percent of Obamacare customers are taking advantage of these special enrollment periods, with no way to verify whether or not they actually qualify. The Federalist has also been looking into Obamacare. They find that healthcare coverage available to families actually gets worse as their income rises.\n\nForty-three years ago this week, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Roe v. Wade gave women the right to have abortions in the US. The Hill\u2019s Congress blog reminds us that for many women in America, abortion is a right on paper only as many state laws prevent women from accessing the procedure.\n\n\n\nThe economy and society\n\nRecent years have seen cities and regions across the country bring in new minimum wage laws in an effort to increase prosperity for the lowest paid workers. The Daily Signal says that new data shows that minimum wage increases appear to have been damaging for six cities, especially to their leisure and hospitality sectors. The Atlantic looks at workers\u2019 rights from the other side of the issue, looking at why some states want strong public sector unions. They say that such strong unions help to curtail strikes and other public sector disruptions.\n\nOn Saturday, Informed Comment has an interesting statistic \u2013 even though more than half of Americans fear that they \u2013 or a family member \u2013 might be a victim of a terrorist attack, they actually are more likely to be hit by lighting.\n\nIllegal immigration has been at the cornerstone of Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, but new research shows that the country\u2019s population of undocumented immigrants has now fallen below 11 million \u2013 continuing a decade-long decline says Federal Eye. The Daily Signal also talks immigration, commenting that 500,000 foreigners overstayed their visas last year in the US, and that this means that more needs to be done to solidify the country\u2019s entry-exit system and to track who is leaving.\n\nOver the last few decades, cars have gotten safer and safer, thanks to technological advances pursued by car manufacturers. Why hasn\u2019t this also been the case for guns? The Atlantic investigates.\n\nPlease read our comments policy before commenting.\n\nNote: This article gives the views of the author, and not the position of USAPP\u2013 American Politics and Policy, nor of the London School of Economics.\n\nShortened URL for this post: http://bit.ly/1UhtT9y", "article_metadata": {"description": "USAPP Managing Editor,\u00a0Chris Gilson looks at the best in political blogging from around the Beltway.
