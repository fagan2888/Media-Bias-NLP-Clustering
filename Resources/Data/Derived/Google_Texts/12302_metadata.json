Now, obviously I disagree with a lot of Obama\u2019s policy decisions. I\u2019ve been disappointed by aspects of his presidency. I hope the next presidency is a philosophic departure.\n\nBut over the course of this campaign it feels as if there\u2019s been a decline in behavioral standards across the board. Many of the traits of character and leadership that Obama possesses, and that maybe we have taken too much for granted, have suddenly gone missing or are in short supply.\n\nThe first and most important of these is basic integrity. The Obama administration has been remarkably scandal-free. Think of the way Iran-contra or the Lewinsky scandals swallowed years from Reagan and Clinton.\n\nWe\u2019ve had very little of that from Obama. He and his staff have generally behaved with basic rectitude. Hillary Clinton is constantly having to hold these defensive press conferences when she\u2019s trying to explain away some vaguely shady shortcut she\u2019s taken, or decision she has made, but Obama has not had to do that.\n\nHe and his wife have not only displayed superior integrity themselves, they have mostly attracted and hired people with high personal standards. There are all sorts of unsightly characters floating around politics, including in the Clinton camp and in Gov. Chris Christie\u2019s administration. This sort has been blocked from team Obama.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSecond, a sense of basic humanity. Donald Trump has spent much of this campaign vowing to block Muslim immigration. You can only say that if you treat Muslim Americans as an abstraction. President Obama, meanwhile, went to a mosque, looked into people\u2019s eyes and gave a wonderful speech reasserting their place as Americans.\n\nHe\u2019s exuded this basic care and respect for the dignity of others time and time again. Let\u2019s put it this way: Imagine if Barack and Michelle Obama joined the board of a charity you\u2019re involved in. You\u2019d be happy to have such people in your community. Could you say that comfortably about Ted Cruz? The quality of a president\u2019s humanity flows out in the unexpected but important moments.\n\nThird, a soundness in his decision-making process. Over the years I have spoken to many members of this administration who were disappointed that the president didn\u2019t take their advice. But those disappointed staffers almost always felt that their views had been considered in depth.\n\nObama\u2019s basic approach is to promote his values as much as he can within the limits of the situation. Bernie Sanders, by contrast, has been so blinded by his values that the reality of the situation does not seem to penetrate his mind.\n\nTake health care. Passing Obamacare was a mighty lift that led to two gigantic midterm election defeats. As Megan McArdle pointed out in her Bloomberg View column, Obamacare took coverage away from only a small minority of Americans. Sanderscare would take employer coverage away from tens of millions of satisfied customers, destroy the health insurance business and levy massive new tax hikes. This is epic social disruption.\n\nTo think you could pass Sanderscare through a polarized Washington and in a country deeply suspicious of government is to live in intellectual fairyland. President Obama may have been too cautious, especially in the Middle East, but at least he\u2019s able to grasp the reality of the situation.\n\nFourth, grace under pressure. I happen to find it charming that Marco Rubio gets nervous on the big occasions \u2014 that he grabs for the bottle of water, breaks out in a sweat and went robotic in the last debate. It shows Rubio is a normal person. And I happen to think overconfidence is one of Obama\u2019s great flaws. But a president has to maintain equipoise under enormous pressure. Obama has done that, especially amid the financial crisis. After Saturday night, this is now an open question about Rubio.\n\nSign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, The Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.\n\nFifth, a resilient sense of optimism. To hear Sanders or Trump, Cruz and Ben Carson campaign is to wallow in the pornography of pessimism, to conclude that this country is on the verge of complete collapse. That\u2019s simply not true. We have problems, but they are less serious than those faced by just about any other nation on earth.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPeople are motivated to make wise choices more by hope and opportunity than by fear, cynicism, hatred and despair. Unlike many current candidates, Obama has not appealed to those passions.\n\nNo, Obama has not been temperamentally perfect. Too often he\u2019s been disdainful, aloof, resentful and insular. But there is a tone of ugliness creeping across the world, as democracies retreat, as tribalism mounts, as suspiciousness and authoritarianism take center stage.\n\nObama radiates an ethos of integrity, humanity, good manners and elegance that I\u2019m beginning to miss, and that I suspect we will all miss a bit, regardless of who replaces him.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20160209032104, "twitter": {"description": "This campaign is highlighting some of the president\u2019s better traits.", "title": "I Miss Barack Obama", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/09/opinion/i-miss-barack-obama.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004195533"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/02/09/opinion/09brooksWeb/09brooksWeb-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/09/opinion/i-miss-barack-obama.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004195533", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/09/opinion/i-miss-barack-obama.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion", "hdl_p": "I Miss Barack Obama", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Feb. 9, 2016", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Presidential Election of 2016,Obama  Barack", "CN": "david-brooks", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "David Brooks", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/02/09/opinion/09brooksWeb/09brooksWeb-thumbLarge.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Obama, Barack", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By DAVID BROOKS", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "This campaign is highlighting some of the president\u2019s better traits.", "tom": "Op-Ed", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "CT": "column", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/02/09/opinion/09brooksWeb/09brooksWeb-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "This campaign is highlighting some of the president\u2019s better traits.", "CG": "opinion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Feb. 9, 2016", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Op-Ed", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/davidbrooks/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified": "2016-02-09", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Obama, Barack", "published": "2016-02-09", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "09brooks", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20160209215821, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/09/opinion/i-miss-barack-obama.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/02/09/opinion/09brooksWeb/09brooksWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "This campaign is highlighting some of the president\u2019s better traits.", "title": "I Miss Barack Obama"}, "pdate": 20160209, "des": "Presidential Election of 2016", "nyt-collection": {"tone": "opinion", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/column/david-brooks", "tagline": "Politics, culture and the social sciences.", "uri": "/column/david-brooks", "display-name": "David Brooks", "identifier": "david-brooks", "type": "column"}, "articleid": 100000004195533, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "I Miss Barack Obama", "col": "Op-Ed Columnist", "PST": "Op-Ed"}, "article_summary": "PhotoAs this primary season has gone along, a strange sensation has come over me: I miss Barack Obama.\nObama radiates an ethos of integrity, humanity, good manners and elegance that I\u2019m beginning to miss, and that I suspect we will all miss a bit, regardless of who replaces him.\nPresident Obama, meanwhile, went to a mosque, looked into people\u2019s eyes and gave a wonderful speech reasserting their place as Americans.\nPresident Obama may have been too cautious, especially in the Middle East, but at least he\u2019s able to grasp the reality of the situation.\nLet\u2019s put it this way: Imagine if Barack and Michelle Obama joined the board of a charity you\u2019re involved in."}
