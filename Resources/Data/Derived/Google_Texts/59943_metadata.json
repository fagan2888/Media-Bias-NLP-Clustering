It hasn't happened before in this type of context, where they are going to shutter them up and literally can't give them away for pennies on the dollar, like Revel,\" said Alan Silver, a former casino-industry executive who teaches at Ohio University in Athens, Ohio.\n\nSilver and other casino-industry experts said there was little precedent for reusing casinos for anything other than hotels.\n\nDavid G. Schwartz, director of the Center for Gaming Research at the University of Nevada in Las Vegas, could point to only one former casino in the United States - the Golden Phoenix in Reno - which was turned into condominiums.\n\nIn addition to condominiums and time-shares, experts are quick to mention boutique hotels, which have become increasingly popular in Las Vegas and other cities.\n\n\"It's nice to do all these things, but you've got to have supply and demand and you've got to have the various attractions there to get people to come to Atlantic City,\" Silver said.\n\nAtlantic City Mayor Don Guardian, who has adopted a salesman-in-chief attitude since taking office in January, spoke optimistically last week of openings expected next year, including a Bass Pro Shops location and Harrah's Conference Center, that could create 1,300 jobs in the city.\n\nGuardian expressed confidence Friday that Revel would be resurrected as a casino under a new name, projecting that it would sell for $25 million to $50 million. That would also reduce the job losses.\n\n\"At $50 million, it's certainly a bargain-basement price for a brand-new facility. It's finding the right buyer, meaning having the financial wherewithal, and then that buyer finding the right brand to come in and run it,\" he said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2014/09/casino_closings_threaten_atlantic_city.html", "image": "http://www.americanthinker.com/assets/images/at-painter-og-image.png", "title": "Blog: Casino closings threaten Atlantic City"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0b1f\"", "article_summary": "\"What we've got in Atlantic City is unprecedented.\nBeyond the thousands of job losses, which will spread into related industries and the general economy, Atlantic City will soon be left with four empty buildings (including the shuttered Atlantic Club) that have no clear future.\n\"This is a massive economic body blow to Atlantic City on par with the hit to the national economy during the Great Recession,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester.\n\"It's nice to do all these things, but you've got to have supply and demand and you've got to have the various attractions there to get people to come to Atlantic City,\" Silver said.\nIn addition to condominiums and time-shares, experts are quick to mention boutique hotels, which have become increasingly popular in Las Vegas and other cities."}
