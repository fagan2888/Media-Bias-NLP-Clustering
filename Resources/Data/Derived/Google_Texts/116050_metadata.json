Premiums have risen often since the passing of Obamacare, which is prompting millions of Americans to pay the penalty to remain uninsured because it works better for their finances. UnitedHealth has incurred horrific losses since they dabbled in the Obamacare market, totaling more than $1 billion. They have all but left that market to save their business. Yet, the premium spike and the sticker shock was an iceberg we all saw coming (via CNN):\n\nAny increases in California, a closely watched state in the health law rollout, are sure to draw intense scrutiny during a presidential election. Republicans are quick to seize on rate hikes as further proof that President Barack Obama's signature law isn't doing enough to hold down health care costs for the average consumer.\n\nInsurers in California have submitted initial rates for 2017, but the final figures won't be known until July after state officials conduct private negotiations.\n\nPeter Lee, executive director of Covered California, underscored that the estimate was preliminary but said some one-time factors under the Affordable Care Act mean \"2017 will be an adjustment year\" for rates.\n\n[\u2026]\n\nThe nation's largest health insurer, UnitedHealth Group (UNH), already has said it will exit all but a handful of state exchanges after suffering substantial losses on individual policies. Lee declined to comment on whether UnitedHealth has submitted a bid to continue selling in Covered California next year.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It's working....05/27/2016 8:39:27AM EST.", "author": "Matt Vespa", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "It's working...", "title": "'Affordable:' California Obamacare Premiums Projected To Rise Eight Percent", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2016/05/13/affordable-california-obamacare-premiums-projected-to-rise-eight-percent-n2162277", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/7/2016-01-07T194049Z_1_LYNXMPEC061CY_RTROPTP_3_USA-HEALTHCARE.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "It's working...", "title": "'Affordable:' California Obamacare Premiums Projected To Rise Eight Percent", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2016/05/13/affordable-california-obamacare-premiums-projected-to-rise-eight-percent-n2162277", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/7/2016-01-07T194049Z_1_LYNXMPEC061CY_RTROPTP_3_USA-HEALTHCARE.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "'Affordable:' California Obamacare Premiums Projected To Rise Eight Percent , Matt Vespa, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "While the real numbers won\u2019t be released until July, California\u2019s Obamacare premium rates are set to spike 8 percent for 2017.\nLee declined to comment on whether UnitedHealth has submitted a bid to continue selling in Covered California next year.\nInsurers in California have submitted initial rates for 2017, but the final figures won't be known until July after state officials conduct private negotiations.\nUnitedHealth has incurred horrific losses since they dabbled in the Obamacare market, totaling more than $1 billion.\nPremiums have risen often since the passing of Obamacare, which is prompting millions of Americans to pay the penalty to remain uninsured because it works better for their finances."}
