Ted Cruz has nailed down all 14 Wyoming Republican delegates up for grabs at the state party convention Saturday, leaving Donald Trump facing yet another loss in a string of defeats in Western states.

Saturday's sweep follows Cruz's victory last month in Wyoming, when he scored 9 of 12 available delegates at county conventions.

Trump and Marco Rubio each won one delegate last month in Wyoming while one remained undecided.

Cruz was the only candidate to address the convention crowd in Casper on Saturday, promising to end what he called President Barack Obama's "war on coal" if he's elected. Cruz ran a well-organized campaign in the state.

Trump still leads the overall delegate race. The AP delegate count: Trump 744; Cruz 559; and Kasich 144. Needed to win: 1,237.
