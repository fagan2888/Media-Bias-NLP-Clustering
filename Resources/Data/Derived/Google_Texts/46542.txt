We’ve all heard stories at one point or another about women giving birth en route to the hospital; they’re often forced to pull over to the side of the road. In the grander scheme of things, these incidents are rare. And what’s even rarer is getting video of the entire birth. But that’s exactly what Jonathan Pettijohn did while driving his wife, Lesia, from their home in Lake Jackson, Texas, to a birth center in Houston.

Within minutes, Lesia went from having contractions, to breaking her water, to giving full-on birth in the passenger seat of the car — and the entire event was captured on Jonathan’s GoPro camera. Lesia asked Jonathan to film the birth of their 10-pound, 3-ounce baby when she went into labor. They named him Josiah after discovering he was a boy while in the car.

“I was probably freaking out way more than I should have,” Lesia told ABC 13 Houston. “But I really didn’t want to have him in the car. I was scared. I didn’t know if he would be breathing OK, or if he would need anything else.”

Fortunately, Josiah came out screaming. And because he is the couple’s third child, they knew exactly what to do. “He’s breathing. If he’s crying, he’s breathing, but hold him upside down, babe,” Jonathan says in the video. “Hold him upside down and pat him on the booty.”

Lesia said Josiah was her fastest birth. Her first two children, both daughters, took “more than an hour” after her water broke, Jonathan said.
