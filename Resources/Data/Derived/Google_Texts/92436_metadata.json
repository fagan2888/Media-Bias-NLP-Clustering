OK Related Issuers Related Research Announcement: Moody's: Most recent M&A in US healthcare sector is credit negative, as leverage increases Global Credit Research - 09 Jul 2015 New York, July 09, 2015 -- M&A in the US healthcare sector has hit a frenzied pace and shows no signs of abating, Moody's Investors Service says in its most recent edition of Healthcare Quarterly. In its latest issue, the rating agency examines what's behind this year's unprecedented spate of deals, many of which could negatively affect acquirers' credit quality. \"The recent surge in M&A among US health insurers follows a relatively tame few years since the passage of the Affordable Care Act,\" says Senior Vice President, Steve Zaharuk. \"Now that more individuals choose their own policies, health insurers are recognizing the increasing importance of price, and companies with a large membership base can, at least in theory, negotiate better discounts with providers.\" Insurers are also looking to further diversify their revenue and earnings streams by growing product segments or expanding geographically in the current volatile political and regulatory environment. But while proposed deals bring acquirers benefits such as increased size and scale, these positives are often overshadowed by credit negative increases in debt, leverage and goodwill. In branded pharmaceuticals, large, research-based companies will continue to pursue M&A to supplement internal product development opportunities. Many deals will also provide strategic benefits, such as enhancing a company's market position. Like most recent transactions, however, future deals will be largely credit negative. \"Sector-wide, we expect leverage to increase, while post-transaction deleveraging plans will likely rely more on EBITDA growth than actual debt repayment,\" says Senior Vice President, Michael Levesque. \"And valuations will remain high, creating risk for creditors, especially where deals involve only pipeline assets.\" For generic and specialty drug makers, consolidation among customers and rising operating costs will continue to drive M&A. Cost synergy opportunities were a key motivator for Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries' hostile bid for Mylan Inc. Moody's changed Teva's rating outlook to negative because the offer, as it currently stands, would significantly increase the company's debt load. And in the medical device sector slower top line growth and customers' and payors' focus on value will continue to drive deals. Potential acquirers will be looking at companies that can give them new products or that seek to improve hospital operating efficiencies, as well as small companies with good growth prospects in specific segments. Future transforming or large debt-financed transactions likely will be credit negative, Moody's says, even when they are partially funded with equity. Moody's Healthcare Quarterly also discusses M&A in other parts of the healthcare sector including hospitals, real estate investment trusts, drug distributors and pharmacy benefit managers.
