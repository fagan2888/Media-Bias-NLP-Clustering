About 76,000 Idahoans signed up for private coverage at healthcare.gov, one of the most successful enrollments in any state.\n\nIdaho will be one of a dozen states, along with Washington, D.C., to run its own online marketplace this year \u2014 and the only one whose state government is completely controlled by Republicans.\n\nIn 2013, Republican Gov. C.L. \u201cButch\u201d Otter and powerful business leaders \u2014 who dislike Obamacare \u2014 persuaded the legislature to build a state exchange to keep control in Boise and save money for consumers.\n\nThat decision may become much more significant since the Supreme Court decided last Friday to hear a lawsuit challenging the government\u2019s authority to grant subsidies to residents in states that do not run their own marketplaces. The high court is scheduled to hear the case early next year and rule by the end of June. More than 80 percent of people buying coverage in state and federal exchanges received subsidies.\n\nIdaho marketplace 570\n\nIn the short run, however, Idaho\u2019s switch may mean little to consumers given how well the federal exchange worked by the close of the first open enrollment period, said Sabrina Corlette, senior research fellow at Georgetown University\u2019s Center on Health Insurance Reforms.\n\nAfter overcoming serious technical troubles in the first two months of open enrollment last fall, the federal exchange had fewer glitches than most state-run exchanges. Those glitches cooled state officials\u2019 interest in building their own websites, and led Oregon and Nevada this fall to abandon their troubled websites and switch to the federal exchange.\n\nWith a final deadline of Friday for states to apply for federal funding to build their own exchanges, it\u2019s unlikely many others will follow.\n\nIdaho is using $35 million in federal money to build its exchange seeking to help 165,000 residents buy coverage. Will it be worth it?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if it will make a big difference or not,\u201d said Ryan Heider, a Twin Falls, Idaho insurance agent and president of the Idaho Association of Health Underwriters.\n\nThe biggest challenge agents will face is handling the surge of signups expected during this year\u2019s three-month open enrollment period that ends Feb. 15. Last year\u2019s open enrollment ran for six months.\n\nAnd consumers will have only a month to choose a policy if they want their coverage to begin in January.\n\nBut if there are any issues, agents hope it will be easier to get answers from Boise than Washington.\n\n\u201cIt was a challenge getting people to help us this past year with healthcare.gov, because they didn\u2019t have specific information for our state,\u201d Heider said.\n\nOfficials at Blue Cross of Idaho, the state\u2019s dominant health insurer, say they were pleased to give input to develop the state exchange, emphasizing the need to keep administrative costs low and maintain a central role for insurance agents and brokers.\n\nThe Idaho exchange will charge insurers 1.5 percent on premiums to cover its overhead, compared to 3.5 percent on policies in the federal exchange. The lower surcharge will mean lower prices for consumers since insurers pass on those costs.\n\nThe surcharge will be the main source of revenue for the Idaho exchange starting next year when all state marketplaces must be self-sustaining.\n\n\u201cOur state exchange will be very helpful for our citizens,\u201d said Blue Cross CEO Zelda Geyer-Sylvia, who is also a member of the state\u2019s exchange board. \u201cWe believe the state made the right decision to have its own exchange.\u201d\n\nUntil this week, Idaho was one of eight states using a \u201cpartnership\u201d model with the federal government in which the state did everything except build and run the website that handles enrollment.\n\nOnly one other state using a partnership exchange \u2014 New Mexico \u2014 is moving to convert to its own exchange though that won\u2019t happen until the fall of 2015 at the earliest.\n\nWhile Idaho has some of the lowest insurance costs in the nation, its uninsured rate has traditionally exceeded the national average. That rate fell from 19.9 percent to 16.6 percent in the past year, according to a Gallup survey. The drop would have been even greater had Idaho expanded Medicaid under the health law, but it is one of 23 states that chose not to.\n\nPat Kelly, executive director of the Idaho exchange, said having a marketplace with the name Idaho in it will attract more residents. The state\u2019s site provides answers to common questions and makes it easy to see the plans\u2019 benefits and prices by zip code.\n\n\u201cThis is an Idaho solution,\u201d he said. The exchange launched a \u201cwindow shopping\u201d feature on Oct. 1 so people could compare plans before open enrollment begins on Nov. 15. More than 50,000 people have already used it.\n\nKelly credits Idaho\u2019s strong first year enrollment to the state\u2019s heavy use of social media such as Facebook, advertising on the Internet radio site Pandora, numerous promotional events across the state and heavy reliance on agents and brokers.\n\nThis year, five health insurers and four dental carriers will sell 198 plans on the exchange\u201352 more than last year.\n\nMountain Health Co-Op is a new health plan on the exchange and has priced many of its offerings lower than the other carriers. Since insurance agents helped sign up more than half of this year\u2019s enrollees, the exchange is working with them to help people renew for next year.\n\nAfter nearly two years of work and countless task force meetings with industry leaders and advocates, Kelly is confident the technology behind exchange will work. Blue Cross\u2019 Geyer-Sylvia is too, but she acknowledges, \u201cWe are really nervous.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"contentType": "GOV Latest Headlines", "description": "Idaho will be one of a dozen states, along with Washington, D.C., to run its own online marketplace this year \u2014 and the only one whose state government is completely controlled by Republicans.", "pubDate": "2014-11-12", "og": {"url": "http://www.governing.com/topics/health-human-services/khn-idaho-health-exchange.html", "description": "Idaho will be one of a dozen states, along with Washington, D.C., to run its own online marketplace this year \u2014 and the only one whose state government is completely controlled by Republicans.", "title": "Idaho: The Only Red State to Launch Its Own Health Exchange"}, "wssUrl": "http://www.governing.com/topics/health-human-services", "fb": {"pages": 6808755897}, "wss": "Health & Human Services", "authors": "[{title: 'Kaiser Health News', url: 'http://www.governing.com/authors/Kaiser-Health-News.html'}]", "google-site-verification": "S75nEL6HHppTHEA4rBAgmVIhw0ChRS2JU_rN07o5Sb0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0488\"", "article_summary": "\u201cOur state exchange will be very helpful for our citizens,\u201d said Blue Cross CEO Zelda Geyer-Sylvia, who is also a member of the state\u2019s exchange board.\nBy Phil GalewitzIdaho on Saturday becomes the latest state to launch its own health insurance exchange under the federal health law, with marketplace officials promising an easier shopping experience for consumers and greater responsiveness to insurance agents.\nThe Idaho exchange will charge insurers 1.5 percent on premiums to cover its overhead, compared to 3.5 percent on policies in the federal exchange.\nBut the exchange, yourhealthidaho.org, will be challenged to do as well as the federal insurance exchange during the first open enrollment period that ended last March.\n\u201cButch\u201d Otter and powerful business leaders \u2014 who dislike Obamacare \u2014 persuaded the legislature to build a state exchange to keep control in Boise and save money for consumers."}
