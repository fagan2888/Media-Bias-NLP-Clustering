The response from Texans and their friends, not unsurprisingly, has been swift and impassioned.\n\nThe President has proposed an oil tax he says, to help fund new vehicle technology, rail initiatives, and cleaner transportation systems, as reported by Breitbart News.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nSome Republican leaders in the U.S. House say that the President\u2019s proposal for a crude oil tax has no chance of getting enough support for legislation to pass. Texans see his proposal as an opportunity for good ole\u2019 fashioned payback for not supporting him in the election. Texas is a red state and for decades, only Republicans have been elected to statewide high office. The Lone Star State went \u201cred\u201d in both the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections.\n\nSome even see Obama\u2019s proposed tax on crude oil as an opportunity for him to try to destroy America. Others see it as an effort to reward OPEC and Middle Eastern countres.\n\nJay Dietrich posted on his Facebook page, \u201cObozo rides again! Ten bucks a barrel production fee on domestic oil. Not imported oil, domestic oil. This boy makes as much sense as double battered, deep fried bat crap\u2026with a ten dollar serving tax on it.\u201d\n\nComments to Dietrich\u2019s post included one from Eugene Chernosky who said, \u201cIt\u2019s Barry\u2019s \u2018penalize the USA and not my Muslim buddies\u2019 program. This POS can\u2019t leave the office of POTUS soon enough!\u201d\n\nLaurel Andreasen posted the comment, \u201cWell why not go out with a \u2018huge\u2019 screw you America.\u201d Michael K. Bohn responded, \u201cHe sure is doing all he can.\u201d\n\nChris Petrowski posted, \u201cOil companies won\u2019t pay the tax, you will.\u201d\n\nTexas Comptroller of Public Accounts Glenn Hegar posted on Facebook, \u201cPresident Obama\u2019s latest liberal scheme is to tack on a $10/barrel of oil fee to fund his fight against climate change. Meanwhile, the oil industry is dealing with the largest slump and financial crisis in over 25 years. This added fee will only shrink our economy and RAISE fuel prices on hard-working families. This act makes me question whether President Obama is working for America or OPEC?\u201d\n\nIn a comment to the Texas Comproller\u2019s post, James Vick wrote, \u201cIt should not even be an idea he is trying to kill the oil and gas industry. This man takes the saying idiot child to a whole new level as he tries to destroy America and his butt buddy puppet politicians are riding his short bus.\u201d\n\nAnother comment to the post by Gerard Tobin wrote, \u201cIt won\u2019t hurt the oil companies because the tax goes from your wallet to obama\u2019s [sic] wallet,\u201d\n\nFrancis Debelo commented, \u201cNo actually it proves that he is succeeding in destroying the American way of life.\u201d\n\nAlthough he worded it a bit differently than some of the other posts,U.S. Steve Scalise said the proposal is indicative of the Obama administration\u2019s track record of enacting policies that hurt the nation\u2019s energy sector, as reported by Breitbart News. \u201cHe has waged open warfare on American energy,\u201d he said. \u201cThe House will kill this absurd proposal, and instead focus on lowering costs and growing our economy.\u201d\n\nLana Shadwick is a writer and legal analyst for Breitbart Texas.
