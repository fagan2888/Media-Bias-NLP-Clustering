Could you tell us anything you are for?\"\n\nBeing an astute politician, he gave an answer even more vacuous and evasive than the standard \"God, country, motherhood, baseball and apple pie.\"\n\nUnfortunately, candidates wanting to be elected are forced by single-issue voters to give vacuous, evasive answers. Today, people will vote for or against a candidate solely if the candidate is for or against an issue like gun control, abortion, global warming, the Iraq War, George W. Bush, Iran, gay marriage, Insure Tennessee, Obamacare, Barack Obama, Michelle Obama, the Keystone pipeline or dozens of other single issues. Some would vote for Satan himself if he supported their personal bias on a particular issue ? and against Jesus if he opposed it.\n\nWe don't select and elect candidates anymore, if we ever did, on the basis of their education, intelligence, experience, wisdom, philosophy or integrity.\n\nRather than question their character, many willingly endorse and participate in denigrating the character of rival candidates.\n\nRather than focus on their dedication to the good of the entire country, we focus on their promise to support to our personal biases regarding single issues.\n\nRather than study and understand the complexity of issues and their interrelationship with other issues, we often base our support or opposition on one narrow, tangential aspect of a single issue.\n\nUntil we force our candidates during campaigns to state comprehensively what they are for, instead of what they are against, and then vote accordingly, it is we, the selfish single-issue voters, who are the major flaw in the election process. Our country is too great for such pettiness. We should be ashamed.\n\nWilliam J. \"Bill\" Oliphant, Knoxville", "article_metadata": {"title": "Letter: Single-issue voters bad for democracy", "og": {"url": "http://www.knoxnews.com/opinion/letters-to-the-editor/letter-single-issue-voters-bad-for-democracy-ep-1212083431-362085981.html", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-kns-icon-200.png", "height": 200}, "type": "article", "description": "Candidates are forced by single-issue voters to give vacuous, evasive answers.", "title": "Letter: Single-issue voters bad for democracy"}, "twitter": {"site": "https://twitter.com/knoxnews", "image": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-kns-icon-200.png", "description": "Candidates are forced by single-issue voters to give vacuous, evasive answers.", "card": "summary", "title": "Letter: Single-issue voters bad for democracy"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-kns-icon-144.png", "__sync_contentCategory": "premium", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Unfortunately, candidates wanting to be elected are forced by single-issue voters to give vacuous, evasive answers.\nRather than focus on their dedication to the good of the entire country, we focus on their promise to support to our personal biases regarding single issues.\nBeing an astute politician, he gave an answer even more vacuous and evasive than the standard \"God, country, motherhood, baseball and apple pie.\"\nUntil we force our candidates during campaigns to state comprehensively what they are for, instead of what they are against, and then vote accordingly, it is we, the selfish single-issue voters, who are the major flaw in the election process.\nAt a campaign rally I once addressed the candidate, a popular native son, saying, \"You have told us all the things you are against."}
