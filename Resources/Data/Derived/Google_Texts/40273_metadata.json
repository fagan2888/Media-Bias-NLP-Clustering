Just four of the 17 seeds - two men and two women - in action Sunday failed to advance to the second round.\n\nThe last to go out, as the evening light dims, is 26th-seeded Guillermo Garcia-Lopez, losing 6-3, 6-3, 6-7 (1), 3-6, 6-3 to 56th-ranked Steve Johnson in the first five-set match at this year\u2019s tournament.\n\nEarlier, Marcos Baghdatis put out 25th-seeded Ivo Karlovic in straight sets.\n\nOn the women\u2019s side, France\u2019s 31st-seeded Caroline Garcia and Peng Shuai, the 24th seed from China who retired injured in the second set against Polona Hercog, are packing their bags.\n\n___\n\n7:18 p.m.\n\nErnests Gulbis offered an apology - accompanied by a hearty laugh - for the delay between the end of his first-round French Open victory and his appearance before the waiting media.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t get a win for a long time this year,\u201d the 24th-seeded Gulbis said after beating Igor Sijsling 6-4, 6-4, 7-6 (3), \u201cso I needed a long massage.\u201d\n\nThe 26-year-old from Latvia entered Sunday with a 2-12 record in 2015, including a recent six-match losing streak.\n\nA year ago at Roland Garros, Gulbis reached his first Grand Slam semifinal, beating Roger Federer along the way.\n\n____\n\n6:56 p.m.\n\nCheers on center court at the French Open as 14th-seeded Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, back from a long-problematic right wrist injury, blows away Swedish qualifier Christian Lindell 6-1, 6-2, 6-2.\n\nThe Frenchman took just 1 hour, 32 minutes to book his place in the second round, winning a whopping 91 percent of points on first serve.\n\n____\n\n6:07 p.m.\n\nThe French Open\u2019s tournament director is giving a Gallic shoulder-shrug about the selfie-seeking fan who approached Roger Federer, saying \u201cthere is no reason for us to change the security procedures.\u201d\n\nAlthough the 2009 champion \u201chas good grounds for being unhappy,\u201d Gilbert Ysern also says: \u201cIt\u2019s not the end of the world.\u201d\n\nHe said the kid is being barred from the rest of the clay-court major.\n\nAnd security guards are being reminded \u201cagain that clearly nobody is allowed to get on court in any case at any time for any reason.\u201d\n\n____\n\n5:39 p.m.\n\nJapan\u2019s fifth-seeded Kei Nishikori is off to a better start than at the 2014 French Open, easing through 6-3, 7-5, 6-1 against French wild card Paul-Henri Mathieu.\n\nCarrying an injury, Nishikori disappointed with a first-round exit at the French last year but rebounded by making the U.S. Open final.\n\nWinning a high 79 percent of points on his first serve and hammering down seven aces, Nishikori took 2 hours, 10 minutes to brush Mathieu off the Court Suzanne Lenglen.\n\nJapan started with five men in the French main draw, the most since 1967, when there were six, and the most at any major since Wimbledon in 1973.\n\nGo Soeda\u2019s 6-1, 6-0, 6-2 first-round loss to Philipp Kohlschreiber quickly reduced their ranks to four.\n\n____\n\n5:04 p.m.\n\nRoger Federer isn\u2019t the only Swiss unhappy with French Open organizers.\n\nStan Wawrinka is complaining about a \u201ccompletely stupid article\u201d that he says appeared on the official www.rolandgarros.com tournament website.\n\nFederer\u2019s Davis Cup teammate said he spotted the article Saturday and \u201cI told the tournament that I wasn\u2019t really happy about it.\u201d\n\nThe article, which seemingly touched on his private life, has since been taken down.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the official website of a Grand Slam, so I hope the guy who did that article is not a journalist,\u201d Wawrinka said. \u201cI also hope the guy who is supposed to check all the articles on the website is not working anymore for the tournament.\u201d\n\nThe eighth-seeded Wawrinka eased into the second round with a 6-3, 6-2, 6-3 victory Sunday against 82nd-ranked Marsel Ilhan.\n\n____\n\n4:25 p.m.\n\nRoger Federer is fuming that a kid got on center court to snap selfies with him at the French Open and is demanding better security.\n\n\u201cThis should never happen on the Philippe Chatrier court,\u201d the 2009 French Open champion said. \u201cI\u2019m not happy about it. Obviously not one second I\u2019m happy about it.\u201d\n\nThe normally calm Swiss says tournament director Gilbert Ysern quickly apologized. Ysern was also seen speaking to Federer\u2019s wife in the players\u2019 lounge.\n\nThe teenage-looking boy ran onto the clay court, put a hand on the 17-time Grand Slam champion\u2019s shoulder and tried to snap photos of them together with his mobile phone. This was as Federer was walking off court from his first-round victory.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s true for all players that you have to feel safe when we play, feel safe on the courts,\u201d Federer said. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t happen too often. It\u2019s happened twice in two days.\u201d\n\nHe said several kids also approached him Saturday during practice: \u201cThere was one who arrived and then followed by five kids. Nobody reacted in terms of safety, you know, security.\u201d\n\nHe spoke scathingly of security guards who took several seconds Sunday to react, with one of them eventually steering the boy away.\n\n\u201cYou know, it\u2019s not just being there, standing there on the courts wearing a nice tie and suit. It\u2019s not that funny, you know,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope that there is going to be a reaction from the tournament.\u201d\n\n____\n\n3:44 p.m.\n\nA selfie-seeking fan\u2019s up-close-and-personal approach of Roger Federer on center court at the French Open raises new questions about player security, an ever-present concern in tennis since the stabbing of Monica Seles in 1993.\n\nSeles was a teenager and ranked No. 1 when obsessed fan Guenter Parche plunged a kitchen knife into her back as she sat on a bench during a changeover at a tournament in Hamburg, Germany.\n\nParche said he didn\u2019t want to kill Seles, only disable her long enough for German rival Steffi Graf to regain the No. 1 ranking. Graf soon assumed the top ranking.\n\nThe attack put Seles out of competition for over two years.\n\nSunday\u2019s incident wasn\u2019t Federer\u2019s first encounter with a French Open intruder. During the second set of the 2009 final, a man jumped over the photographer\u2019s pit, went right up to Swiss and tried to put a red hat on him. Federer brushed him aside before security guards got close enough to intervene. After hopping the net, the man was tackled and jailed for questioning.\n\nNo comment yet from tournament organizers on the latest incident.\n\n____\n\n3:30 p.m.\n\nIvo Karlovic is the first seeded man to exit from the French Open. The big server, seeded 25th, hit 21 aces in losing 7-6 (5), 6-4, 6-4 to Marcos Baghdatis on Court 7.\n\nBaghdatis, runner-up at the 2006 Australian Open, next plays Damir Dzumhir in the second round.\n\n____\n\n3:10 p.m.\n\nSurely, this was pushing the selfie craze too far.\n\nA kid ran down from the stands and across center court at Roland Garros to get a selfie with Roger Federer after the 17-time Grand Slam champion\u2019s first-round victory against Alejandro Falla.\n\nThe boy, as casual as can be, put his hand across Federer\u2019s shoulder as the tennis great was walking off court with his kit bag, and tried to snap several shots of the two of them together with his mobile phone.\n\nClearly very uncomfortable, the 2009 champion gently rebuffed the boy, stepped back and glanced over questioningly at security guards for help. After a delay of several seconds, one of them grasped the boy around the waist and steered him away.\n\nThe kid then went back the way he came, strolling back across court to the seats.\n\n____\n\n2:43 p.m.\n\nRoger Federer is beaming after his straightforward 6-3, 6-3, 6-4 first-round win against Alejandro Falla, a Colombian who entered the main draw as a lucky loser from qualifying.\n\nFacing a player who pushed him to five sets at Wimbledon five years ago, the 2009 Roland Garros champion was never threatened, extending his unbeaten run against the 111th-ranked Falla to 8-0, serving eight aces.\n\n\u201cI love coming here,\u201d Federer said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t broken. I\u2019m happy.\u201d\n\nIn the third set, Falla called for a medical timeout, getting some deep massage on his right thigh.\n\nSticking out like a sore thumb in ultra-pink shorts (is that color even legal?), Federer paced around the court to stay limber during the break.\n\nFalla lost the last two games and the match.\n\n____\n\n2:01 p.m.\n\nOnce bitten, twice shy. Third-seeded Simona Halep, the losing women\u2019s French Open finalist last year, has good reason to be wary of her next opponent, Mirjana Lucic-Baroni. The 70th-ranked Croatian beat Halep in straight sets in the U.S. Open third round last year.\n\n\u201cI have not good memories from that match,\u201d Halep recalled after her first-round 7-5, 6-4 victory on Sunday at Roland Garros against Evgenia Rodina. \u201cI just was blocked and I couldn\u2019t hit the ball.\u201d\n\nLucic-Baroni advanced to the second round by beating Lauren Davis, a 64th-ranked American, 6-3, 3-6, 6-3.\n\n____\n\n12:45 p.m.\n\nLast year\u2019s losing women\u2019s finalist, Simona Halep, is safely through to the second round, closing out a 7-5, 6-4 victory against Russian Evegenia Rodina with an ace.\n\nThe third-seeded Romanian, dressed all in black, celebrated with a fist pump.\n\nRoger Federer is up next on center court. The winner of a record 17 Grand Slam titles got a standing ovation as he stepped onto Court Philippe Chatrier, acknowledging the applause, shrieks and whistles with a quick wave of his right hand.\n\nFederer is wearing an outfit Andre Agassi would approve of: day-glo pink shorts with purple stripes down the sides and a purple shirt.\n\nHis first-round opponent is Alejandro Falla. The Colombian, into the main draw as a lucky loser, pushed Federer to five sets in the first round at Wimbledon in 2010.\n\n____\n\n12:19 p.m.\n\nThe first match-winner this year is Bosnian Damir Dzumhur, in the men\u2019s draw. He was up two sets against Mikhail Youzhny when the Russian retired at the start of the third. Youzhny was a quarterfinalist in 2010.\n\nOn the women\u2019s side, the first winner is Teliana Pereira. The Brazilian qualifier chomped through Fiona Ferro, a 326th-ranked French wild card, in 65 minutes, winning 6-3, 6-2.\n\n____\n\n11:57 a.m.\n\nOut on Court 2, Philipp Kohlschreiber, seeded 22nd, has torn through his first set against Japan\u2019s Go Soeda, winning 6-1. Kohlschreiber (aged 31) and Soeda (30) are among 39 men aged 30 or over in the Roland Garros main draw. That is a Grand Slam record.\n\nAnother veteran, 32-year-old Mikhail Youzhny, is off to a bad start on Court 6, losing his first set 6-2 against Bosnian Damir Dzumhur.\n\nThe most golden of oldies, 33-year-old Roger Federer, follows Simona Halep on center court. Last year\u2019s losing women\u2019s finalist is up against Evgenia Rodina, winning the first set 7-5.\n\n____\n\n10:52 a.m.\n\nHere we go again. On a sunny Sunday morning, play is about to start at the French Open, as grounds crews finish watering the center court.\n\nThe weather forecasts are excellent, with temperatures expected to reach 22 degrees Celsius (72 F) in the afternoon.\n\nLast year\u2019s runner-up Simona Halep will open play on Center Court. The third-seeded Romanian player is taking on Russian Evgenia Rodina before Roger Federer starts his bid for an 18th Grand Slam title against lucky loser Alejandro Falla.", "article_metadata": {"description": "8:22 p.m.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "8:22 p.m.", "title": "The Latest: French Open loses 4 seeds on Day 1", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/24/the-latest-halep-to-open-play-on-center-court/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/24/4618c47908165517770f6a70670042ff.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/24/4618c47908165517770f6a70670042ff.jpg", "description": "8:22 p.m.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "The Latest: French Open loses 4 seeds on Day 1"}, "Author": "The Associated Press", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb00f\"", "article_summary": "PARIS (AP) - 8:22 p.m.Seeded players, for the most part, earned their crust by living up to expectations on Day 1 of the French Open.\nOn a sunny Sunday morning, play is about to start at the French Open, as grounds crews finish watering the center court.\nThe last to go out, as the evening light dims, is 26th-seeded Guillermo Garcia-Lopez, losing 6-3, 6-3, 6-7 (1), 3-6, 6-3 to 56th-ranked Steve Johnson in the first five-set match at this year\u2019s tournament.\n___7:18 p.m.Ernests Gulbis offered an apology - accompanied by a hearty laugh - for the delay between the end of his first-round French Open victory and his appearance before the waiting media.\n____3:30 p.m.Ivo Karlovic is the first seeded man to exit from the French Open."}
