Barnard is leaving to become CEO at St. Rose Dominican Hospitals \u2014 San Martin campus, a division of Dignity Health.\n\nThe UMC governing board earlier this year studied how to compensate Barnard appropriately, but layoffs were being planned, prompting a delay offering Barnard a raise and contract. Hundreds of positions were eliminated from the UMC system through layoffs and attrition from April until August.\n\nVanHouweling has a skill set similar to the widely praised Barnard and can continue a renaissance taking place at UMC, hospital Chief of Staff Dr. Dale Carrison said Thursday. If VanHouweling is named interim CEO, the UMC board and county commissioners have another opportunity to come up with a compensation package to keep a talented executive in place to continue the work Barnard started, Carrison said.\n\nVanHouweling was one of the executives hired by Barnard, Carrison said, and that team is looking to offer new services, cut expenses and provide quality patient care.\n\nCommissioner Lawrence Weekly earlier this week said Clark County could not offer any hospital CEO \u201c$400,000 to $500,000\u201d because UMC is public, not private. Commissioner Steve Sisolak echoed those thoughts Thursday, saying there are limits to what the county can do.\n\n\u201cI for one am not interested in getting into a bidding war with the private sector because that\u2019s not a competition we can win,\u201d Sisolak said.\n\nCompensation for the head of UMC should be in line with other similar county executives, such as the county manager or airport director, and other public hospitals nationwide, Sisolak said.\n\nIn 2013, professors with the Harvard School of Public Health in Boston studied the compensation of the heads of U.S. nonprofit hospitals, and they found those executives earned an average of almost $600,000 a year. The research, published in October 2013 in JAMA Internal Medicine, showed chief executive officers overseeing larger, urban teaching institutions had a median salary of more than $1.66 million.\n\nAt UMC in January, then-Chief Operating Officer Barnard succeeded Brian Brannman, now vice president of operations for Dignity Health Nevada and CEO of St. Rose Dominican Hospitals \u2014 Sienna campus. Brannman directed UMC from August 2012 after taking over for Kathy Silver, who retired after a long career in health care.\n\nBrannman is the designated successor to Rod Davis, senior vice president of operations for Dignity Health Nevada, and is expected to be named to the role when Davis retires this month.\n\nIn January 2007, Silver was named acting CEO after one of the worst scandals in the county hospital\u2019s history. Silver took over after the firing of former UMC CEO Lacy Thomas because of irregularities involving UMC financing.\n\nThomas was indicted in 2008, accused of mismanaging the hospital\u2019s money by awarding $10 million in contracts to friends and associates of his from Chicago. The case against Thomas, who has denied all the charges, is still pending before Clark County District Court Judge Michael Villani. A hearing is scheduled to consider a motion to dismiss in January, and the trial is scheduled for March.\n\nContact Steven Moore at 702-380-4563 or smoore@reviewjournal.com.", "article_metadata": {"parsely-link": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/life/health/umc-set-pick-third-ceo-year", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "STEVEN MOORE Las Vegas Review-Journal", "parsely-title": "UMC set to pick third CEO in a year", "parsely-image-url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_web_mason_umc_mug.jpg", "twitter": {"description": "University Medical Center officials Friday are poised to install their third chief executive in less than a year as the public hospital\u2019s governing board meets to discuss a successor to Larry Barnard, who is taking a similar position in the private sector.", "creator": {"identifier": "@reviewjournal", "id": 15358759}, "url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/life/health/umc-set-pick-third-ceo-year", "image": {"src": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_web_mason_umc_mug.jpg"}, "title": "UMC set to pick third CEO in a year", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-pub-date": "2014-12-05T02:28:52Z", "vf": {"unique_id": "reviewjournal-nid-1967456"}, "al": {"web": {"should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "review-journal://?eid=2340704", "app_name": "review-journal", "package": "com.LVRJ"}, "ios": {"url": "review-journal://?eid=2340704", "app_store_id": 540820524, "app_name": "review-journal"}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1098299519", "fb": {"admins": 630759385, "app_id": 195491203833571}, "google-play-app": "app-id=com.LVRJ", "parsely-author": "STEVEN MOORE Las Vegas Review-Journal", "parsely-section": "Health", "keywords": "Health,Las Vegas, Life, News,", "parsely-type": "post", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-04T18:28:52-08:00"}, "parsely-tags": "Health,Las Vegas,Life,News", "og": {"site_name": "Las Vegas Review-Journal", "description": "University Medical Center officials Friday are poised to install their third chief executive in less than a year as the public hospital\u2019s governing board meets to discuss a successor to Larry Barnard, who is taking a similar position in the private sector.", "title": "UMC set to pick third CEO in a year", "url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/life/health/umc-set-pick-third-ceo-year", "image": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_web_mason_umc_mug.jpg", "type": "article"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9", "description": "University Medical Center officials Friday are poised to install their third chief executive in less than a year as the public hospital\u2019s governing board meets to discuss a successor to Larry Barnard, who is taking a similar position in the private sector."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfdf1\"", "article_summary": "Silver took over after the firing of former UMC CEO Lacy Thomas because of irregularities involving UMC financing.\nIn January 2007, Silver was named acting CEO after one of the worst scandals in the county hospital\u2019s history.\nCommissioner Lawrence Weekly earlier this week said Clark County could not offer any hospital CEO \u201c$400,000 to $500,000\u201d because UMC is public, not private.\nBarnard is leaving to become CEO at St. Rose Dominican Hospitals \u2014 San Martin campus, a division of Dignity Health.\nVanHouweling has a skill set similar to the widely praised Barnard and can continue a renaissance taking place at UMC, hospital Chief of Staff Dr. Dale Carrison said Thursday."}
