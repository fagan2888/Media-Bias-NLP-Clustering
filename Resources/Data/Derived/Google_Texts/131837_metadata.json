The list includes delays of the employer mandate, subsidy verification requirements, insurance deadlines, and two extensions that let states continue to use high-risk pools.\n\nMost recently, the report notes a second extension, announced on March 5, to allow individuals to keep their so-called \u201csubstandard\u201d health insurance plans that do not comply with Obamacare until October 2017.\n\n\u201cAt a time when the law is creating more uncertainty for working families and for our economy, the president continues to circumvent Congress and issue delays to parts of the law,\u201d Cantor said. \u201cNot only are these delays unilateral, but they are oftentimes put forth in a way that is not apparent to the American people, buried on holiday weekends, late evenings, and even entirely behind closed doors as we saw last week.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe American people deserve better,\u201d he said.\n\nThe report also updates executive actions in the area of immigration.\n\nAside from the \u201cDeferred Action\u201d program, which allows young illegal immigrants to gain legal status, the administration continued to alter immigration enforcement laws in 2013.\n\nCantor noted a directive in August that ordered Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials \u201cnot to enforce immigration laws in cases in which the illegal immigrant is the primary provider for a minor child, regardless of the child\u2019s immigration status.\u201d\n\nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services announced in November that illegal alien family members of servicemen and women could receive \u201cparole-in-place\u201d status.\n\n\u201cNotably, the parole statute, the regulations, and the legislative history do not seem to contemplate parole for: (1) aliens who are already in the United States illegally, (2) an entire category of people, or (3) an indefinite period of time,\u201d the report notes. \u201cExtending parole in place in this manner is a re-write of the law.\u201d\n\nCantor\u2019s first report, released in October 2012, cited more than 40 examples, including lesser-known administrative actions such as a refusal to enforce the Nuclear Waste Policy Act and rewriting bankruptcy law.\n\nTo combat the unilateral moves, House Republicans passed two bills this week, including the \u201cEnforce the Law Act,\u201d legislation that would expedite the process for Congress to sue the administration for not enforcing laws.\n\nThe House also passed the \u201cFaithful Execution of the Law\u201d Act, which would require the administration to notify Congress whenever it \u201cimplements a formal or informal policy to not enforce a provision of law.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s blatant disregard for Congress is causing confusion, harming families, and continuing us on a path farther and farther from the rule of law and balance of powers contained in our Constitution,\u201d Cantor said. \u201cThe House will continue to conduct oversight to protect the American people from executive over-reach and return our country to a government that functions as it should within the framework of our Constitution.\u201d",
