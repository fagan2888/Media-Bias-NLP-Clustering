Here are seven things beginning with the letters \u2018J\u2019 and \u2018K\u2019 that someone, somewhere has deemed racist.\n\nJoking about Obamacare is racist according to an obscure leftist website called Salon. In October 2013, the minor site charged that Ted Cruz was practicing \u201cGOP dog-whistle politics at its finest\u201d when he suggested that \u201cNigerian email scammers\u201d have \u201cbecome a lot less active lately\u201d because they have \u201call been hired to run the Obamacare website.\u201d The bloggers at Salon contended that \u201cit\u2019s a short hop from Nigeria to Kenya\u201d and, consequently, Cruz was somehow alluding to conspiracy theories about President Obama\u2019s birth in Kenya. The distance from Kenya to Nigeria is actually about 2,000 miles, but, presumably, for Salon\u2019s geographically-challenged writers, Africa is just one big piece of land filled with people who have black skin.\n\nA radio talk show named Mark Thompson called kitchen cabinets racial after 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney used the phrase at an NAACP convention. \u201cTo talk about being in the kitchen and not talk about an African-American actually being in your cabinet is really not a good metaphor to use with African-Americans,\u201d Thompson complained bitterly, according to Right Wings News. Political foes of President Andrew Jackson coined the term in the 1830s as an insult to his close circle of advisers. Later presidents including John F. Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson and Ronald Reagan were also said to have kitchen cabinets.\n\nIn April, professors Syracuse University and DePauw University called the cartoon film \u201cJungle Book\u201d racist and demanded that the Walt Disney Company make a different version of the beloved movie which depicts a society of apes. Disney has plans to film a live-action remake of the 1967 flick, which concerns an Indian boy, Mowgli, who is raised by wolves in the wild and finds friendship in a bear and a panther. Popular songs from the original movie include, \u201cThe Bare Necessities\u201d and \u201cI Want To Be Like You.\u201d The later musical sequence has occasionally provoked controversy among critics who have insisted that the apes who perform the number are meant to represent a racist view of black people.
