As previously reported, the spot highlights Republican candidate Whitney Westerfield, a Hopkinsville attorney and the state Senate Judiciary chairman, as having spent time as a prosecutor \u201cwho put criminals behind bars.\u201d\n\nThe ad targets Beshear for having a lack of law enforcement experience, having a campaign \u201cfunded by special interests he would oversee as attorney general\u201d and that he \u201cwould support Obama\u2019s policies.\u201d\n\nBy Wednesday the campaign for Beshear, the son of Democratic Gov. Steve Beshear, sent a notice via an attorney to stations which \u201cdemand(s) removal of misleading and false advertisement.\u201d\n\nThe strongly worded letter warns stations that by airing the ad they expose the station \u201cto legal liability for which damages may be sought, we ask that you refuse to air the ad and/or immediately remove it from the air.\u201d\n\nAt the heart of the letter from DBL Law Practice is the remark on Beshear and Obama. DBL says the cited materials in the RAGA ad do not prove that Beshear \u201cwould support Obama\u2019s policies,\u201d as the ad states.\n\nRead the entire section of the letter dealing with the claims in the image below:\n\nDownload the full complaint here: Letter to stations.pdf\n\nOn Friday, the RAGA responded with their own letter to stations defending their ad and the claims therein.\n\nAttorneys for RAGA, with law firm Clark Hill in Washington, D.C., argue that \u201c(t)he letter from Beshear\u2019s counsel is a desperate attempt to conceal Beshear\u2019s lack of experience, questionable campaign contributions, and support for President Obama\u2019s policies. It is meant to intimidate stations and outside advertisers in the lead up to the election.\u201d\n\n\u201cBeshear\u2019s challenge is baseless. Each and every statement in the advertisement is carefully worded, documented and supported, and Beshear does not present a single fact or piece of documentation to dispute the RAGA advertisement. In fact, RAGA\u2019s advertisement is accurate in every respect, raises critical public policy and character issues, and should continue to air.\u201d\n\nAttorneys for RAGA say that the statement at question: \u201cBeshear would support Obama\u2019s policies\u201d is deliberately broad.\n\n\u201c(I)t would be impossible to list all of Obama\u2019s policies that Beshear would support in a thirty-second ad. By maintaining that the ad is \u2018misleading and false\u2019 based on RAGA\u2019s general statement, Beshear is declaring that he would not support a single Obama policy,\u201d the letter reads. \u201cIf Beshear wants to dispute RAGA\u2019s claim, he would need to demonstrate his fundamental opposition to every single policy that President Obama has implemented, proposed or supported.\u201d\n\nDownload the full response here: RAGA \u2013 Response Letter to Stations 7.17.15 .pdf\n\nAt the time this story was published the ad was still running during a review by the stations\u2019 legal counsel.\n\nIn a statement sent to Pure Politics, RAGA Executive Director Scott Will said that for voters it\u2019s pretty simple.\n\n\u201cBeshear is an Obama liberal,\u201d Will said. \u201cHe\u2019s voted for President Obama twice and he\u2019s voiced his support for Obamacare while on the campaign trail. It doesn\u2019t get much simpler than that.\u201d\n\nAndy Hightower, a spokesman for Westerfield, said that the July ad by RAGA and the involvement of attorney\u2019s seems to show that the campaign for Beshear is in panic.\n\n\u201cIt seems early for Andy Beshear\u2019s campaign to be in such a panic, but I\u2019d want to distance myself from President Obama\u2019s terrible policy decisions too,\u201d Hightower told Pure Politics in a statement. \u201cUnfortunately, the only record Andy Beshear has is his father\u2019s; a record of embracing Obama at every turn.\u201d\n\nBeshear\u2019s campaign communications director Galia Slayen responded to Pure Politics request for comment saying, \u201cthe letter speaks for itself.\u201d\n\nWatch the full ad in question below.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "cn|2", "description": "The campaign of Democratic attorney general candidate Andy Beshear is attempting to have an ad by the Republican Attorneys General Association removed from Lexington airwaves. \n\n\tThe ad first was launched on Tuesday  in the Lexington market where the 30-second spot is airing on: WLEX-TV, WKYT-TV...", "title": "Andy Beshear's campaign attempts to have GOP ad pulled; RAGA defends first ad of cycle", "url": "http://mycn2.com/politics/andy-beshear-s-campaign-attempts-to-have-raga-ad-pulled-raga-defends-1st-ad", "image": "http://mycn2.com/images/10841.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://mycn2.com/images/10841.jpg", "description": "<p>The campaign of Democratic attorney general candidate Andy Beshear is attempting to have an ad by the Republican Attorneys General Association removed from Lexington airwaves. </p>\n\n\t<p>The ad first was launched <a href=\"http://mycn2.com/politics/republican-ag-group-enters-election-fray-with-ad-highlighting-westerfield-and-attacking-beshear\">on Tuesday</a>  in the Lexington market where the 30-second spot is airing on: <span class=\"caps\">WLEX</span>-TV, <span class=\"caps\">WKYT</span>-TV and <span class=\"caps\">WTVQ</span>-TV.
