Jim Gilmore.\n\nWashington Times Editor John Solomon was the moderator.\n\nFein called Snowden a \u201chero in the tradition of Thomas Paine.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe NSA intended to keep these programs secret forever,\u201d he said, noting Director of National Intelligence James Clapper\u2019s denials that the NSA was collecting data on millions of Americans.\n\nHe argued Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., could not have filed a suit without Snowden\u2019s revelations.\n\nOtherwise, Fein said, \u201cwe only had speculation the NSA was listening, not proof.\u201d\n\nSnowden did what all the members of Congress were unwilling to do, Fein contended, \u201cexposing to the American people the NSA abuse of its power.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for Edward Snowden, we would not be having today this debate over the meaning of the Fourth Amendment,\u201d he said.\n\nGilmore acknowledged that the \u201cpreservation of our freedom is the entire game in the post-9/11 world.\u201d\n\nBut he said Snowden is \u201ca traitor and a coward\u201d who \u201cbetrayed the public trust.\u201d\n\nHis assessment drew boos from the crowd.\n\n\u201cWhen the time came for him to flee, as a coward would, he went to Hong Kong where he exposed the information to the press, if not to the communist Chinese,\u201d Gilmore said.\n\n\u201cThen he went to Russia, where he shared the information with a thug \u2013 Putin.\u201d\n\nThe former governor said Snowden should be charged with treason along with the charges that have been brought under espionage laws.\n\nThe Times editor, Solomon, said \u201cevery single person in this room should be concerned the government is reading our emails and listening into our telephone conversations.\u201d\n\nReferencing the IRS discrimination against conservatives, Solomon raised the question of whether the NSA might not just be targeting foreign enemies and terrorists, but also political enemies.\n\nGilmore emphasized the importance of maintaining surveillance of foreign enemies and of independent terrorist groups and insisted the solution is improved oversight by Congress.\n\nFein said he believes Paul\u2019s suit will be successful, and the Supreme Court will find it unconstitutional for the NSA \u201cto collect forever all information on every telephone and conversation conducted by every American, without any suspicion of wrongdoing.\u201d\n\nHe said Gilmore does not understand that the greatest defense asset the nation has is the loyalty of its citizens.\n\n\u201cWhen the government believes all Americans are traitors, the government will lose the loyalty of the citizens,\u201d he said.\n\nGilmore said it\u2019s \u201cnonsense demagoguery to suspect the NSA is collecting data on everyone.\u201d\n\nSolomon said \u201call the NSA has to do is get the records of all phone calls made from CPAC and the NSA has their assignment log for the next year.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the Obama administration can have the IRS target conservatives, why not also have the NSA target conservatives?\u201d he asked.\n\nEarlier Friday at CPAC, Texas Gov. Rick Perry, in a rousing, animated speech, declared it\u2019s \u201ctime for a little rebellion on the battlefield of ideas.\u201d\n\nLater, Rand Paul drew the conference\u2019s most enthusiastic response to a presidential candidate, declaring, \u201cI will not retreat an inch, and I will be heard.\u201d\n\nAnti-Obama filmmaker Dinesh D\u2019Souza also unveiled a new trailer for his upcoming film, and in a panel, a leading attorney representing tea party groups disclosed that IRS official Lois Lerner was interviewed by the Department of Justice\n\nThursday, after Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s call to dismantle Barack Obama\u2019s agenda, including a complete repeal of Obamacare, CPAC speakers touched on similar themes, envisioning 2014 as a prime opportunity to seize on Democrat failures and articulate an alternative vision for the country.\n\nCruz was followed by Sen. Mitch McConnell\u2019s call to fight Obamacare with \u201ceverything we\u2019ve got,\u201d Rep. Paul Ryan\u2019s belief that the GOP is primed for victory and the Democrats \u201cwill overreach,\u201d Sen. Tim Scott\u2019s call for \u201cresponsibility,\u201d Sen. Marco Rubio\u2019s conviction that the world is on the verge of a \u201cnew American century,\u201d Sen. Mike Lee\u2019s exhortation to conservatives to\u201dget to work,\u201d Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal\u2019s call to mirror his state\u2019s performance-based evaluations of teachers and Donald Trump\u2019s urging to \u201cmake America great again.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Cruz told WND after his speech that social issues should not be taken off the table in the 2014, former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton called Obama the nation\u2019s \u201cbiggest security threat\u201d and Chris Christie showed that despite major political setbacks in recent months, his star power has not dimmed.\n\nWND\u2019s coverage of CPAC:", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "By Jerome Corsi and Garth Kant NATIONAL HARBOR, Md. \u2013 Is the former NSA contractor who leaked classified documents exposing U.S. surveillance on American citizens along with highly sensitive information crucial to the nation\u2019s security a \u201chero\u201d or a \u201ccowardly traitor\u201d?
