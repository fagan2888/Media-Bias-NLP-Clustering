No, far more serious is the kind of catastrophe facing people like Richard Streeter, 47, a truck driver and recreational vehicle repairman in Eugene, Ore. His problem isn\u2019t Obamacare, but a tumor in his colon that may kill him because Obamacare didn\u2019t come quite soon enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cStreeter had health insurance for decades, but beginning in 2008 his employer no longer offered it as an option. He says he tried to buy individual health insurance but, as a lifelong smoker in his late 40s, couldn\u2019t find anything affordable\u2013so he took a terrible chance and did without. At the beginning of this year, Streeter began to notice blood in his bowel movements and discomfort in his rectum. Because he didn\u2019t have health insurance, he put off going to the doctor and reassured himself it was just irritation from sitting too many hours\u201d, said Senator Reid (source: Congressional Record http://thomas.loc.gov).\n\nThe consequences of being uninsured in America are dire! Nationwide, 18,000 adults between the ages of 25 and 64 died in 2000 because they did not have health insurance. That trend unfortunately continues until everyone eventually gets covered.\n\nA delay, no matter how small it is in Obamacare will translate to an increase in people dying in America \u2013 for them it simply didn\u2019t come fast enough.\n\nAcross the nation, 26,100 people between the ages of 25 and 64 died prematurely due to a lack of health coverage in 2010.\n\nThat works out to:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "GroundReport", "description": "On November 4, 2013 Senator Harry Reid of Nevada asked for and was granted permission to address the United States Senate for a few minutes regarding the delay in the Affordable Care Act. \u201cThe biggest health care crisis in America right now is not the inexcusably messy rollout of Obamacare.\u00a0No, far more serious is the \u2026", "title": "\"Obamacare may not come quite soon enough\" for some people warns Senator Reid  - GroundReport", "url": "http://www.groundreport.com/obamacare-may-not-come-quite-soon-enough-for-some-people-warns-senator-reid/", "image": {"width": 400, "identifier": "http://www.groundreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/UninsuredOveractiveThyroid.jpg", "height": 266}, "updated_time": "2013-11-07T13:12:41+00:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "article": {"section": "Healthcare", "published_time": "2013-11-05T11:37:06+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-07T13:12:41+00:00"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.groundreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/UninsuredOveractiveThyroid.jpg", "description": "On November 4, 2013 Senator Harry Reid of Nevada asked for and was granted permission to address the United States Senate for a few minutes regarding the delay in the Affordable Care Act. \u201cThe biggest health care crisis in America right now is not the inexcusably messy rollout of Obamacare.\u00a0No, far more serious is the \u2026", "card": "summary", "title": "\"Obamacare may not come quite soon enough\" for some people warns Senator Reid  - GroundReport"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9f5c\"", "article_summary": "Nationwide, 18,000 adults between the ages of 25 and 64 died in 2000 because they did not have health insurance.\n\u201cObamacare may not come quite soon enough\u201d for some people warns Senator ReidOn November 4, 2013 Senator Harry Reid of Nevada asked for and was granted permission to address the United States Senate for a few minutes regarding the delay in the Affordable Care Act.\nBecause he didn\u2019t have health insurance, he put off going to the doctor and reassured himself it was just irritation from sitting too many hours\u201d, said Senator Reid (source: Congressional Record http://thomas.loc.gov).\nA delay, no matter how small it is in Obamacare will translate to an increase in people dying in America \u2013 for them it simply didn\u2019t come fast enough.\nHe says he tried to buy individual health insurance but, as a lifelong smoker in his late 40s, couldn\u2019t find anything affordable\u2013so he took a terrible chance and did without."}
