BLACKSTONE, Mass. (AP) — The bodies of three infants were found in a Massachusetts house filled with vermin and piled high with soiled diapers, where four other children were removed by authorities last month, a prosecutor said.

Detectives investigating a case of reckless endangerment of children found the bodies Thursday at the house in Blackstone, about 50 miles southwest of Boston on the Rhode Island border.

Worcester County District Attorney Joseph Early Jr. said the house was in “deplorable condition.” He said authorities don’t know when or how the babies died, or their ages and genders. No criminal charges have been filed in connection with the deaths.

Four other children, including a 6-month-old baby, were removed from the house last month after a neighbor notified police about their living conditions, Early said. Those children are in state custody.

A woman who lives at the home was arrested on charges related to the living conditions at the house, according to police. Prosecutors said Erika Murray, 31, would be arraigned Friday on charges including intimidation of a witness. It was not immediately known whether she had an attorney.

Investigators working in the small house were wearing hazmat suits, and were decontaminated when they left, the prosecutor said.

“The house is filled with vermin,” Early said. “We have flies. We have bugs. We have used diapers, in some areas, as much as a foot-and-a-half to two-feet high. The house is in a deplorable condition.”

Early said children, ages 13, 10, 3 and 6 months old were removed from the house Aug. 28. The prosecutor said one of the children in the house approached a neighbor about a child who wouldn’t stop crying. Early said the 6-month-old was found covered with feces lying on a bed.
