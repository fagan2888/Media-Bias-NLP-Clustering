A man hiking on Flagstaff Mountain west of Boulder on Sunday afternoon fell to his death.

The man was hiking with another man, both about 21 years old, when he lost balance and fell approximately 150 to 200 feet, according to a statement from the Boulder County Sheriff’s Office.

He suffered fatal injuries and was pronounced dead at the scene, the statement said. His name wasn’t released.

Two other hikers tried to help, and performed CPR on the man.

Rescue workers responded at about 3:30 p.m., rushing to the 2.6 mile marker along Flagstaff Road.

Sheriff’s deputies and rescuers from Rocky Mountain Rescue, the Boulder Fire Department, Boulder Mountain Parks and AMR ambulance assisted. The Boulder County Coroner was contacting relatives and determining the cause and manner of death.
