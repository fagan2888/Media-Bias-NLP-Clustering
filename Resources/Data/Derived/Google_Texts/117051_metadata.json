(Photo courtesy of Susan Campbell)\n\nBOSTON \u2013 Hundreds of Boston Public Schools students climbed Beacon Hill Monday to protest proposed state education budget cuts as the Legislature\u2019s Joint Committee on Education began a marathon public hearing inside the State House, drawing heated testimony from supporters and opponents of charter schools and Common Core education standards.\n\nThe timing of the student rally didn\u2019t appear directly linked to the hearing, in which Boston Mayor Marty Walsh voiced opposition to raising the limit on charter school authorizations. Immediately after he left the hearing room, a host of reporters surrounded the mayor to ask for comments on the rally outside and the city\u2019s school budget gap.\n\nWalsh said he was disappointed by what he described as \u201cmisinformation\u201d and criticized reports that the deficit had ballooned to $50 million.\n\n#bpswalkout students\u2019 stickers: \u201cMillions for GE, Budget Cuts for Schools\u201d #makeGEpay@generalelectric@marty_walshpic.twitter.com/QUAYOYrONO \u2014 Eli Gerzon (@eligerzon) March 7, 2016\n\n\u201cThe students are protesting about it, again I think it\u2019s a good thing, but they can certainly come to the State House and protest after school for additional funding,\u201d he added.\n\nWalsh added that rumors of predetermined \u201cmajor cuts\u201d are false.\n\n\u201c\u2018Major cuts\u2019 hasn\u2019t come out of my mouth,\u201d Walsh said. \u201cIt\u2019s still too early. We\u2019re still in the middle of the process.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou guys have followed this, when a budget comes out, it\u2019s \u2018the sky is falling,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nInitially, Walsh said, the deficit \u201cwas around $30 million,\u201d adding it is \u201ca lot smaller than that today.\u201d\n\nWalsh also pointed out that Boston has \u201creceived less and less state money during the last decade\u201d but added that the \u201ccity has some housekeeping to do as well.\u201d\n\nBetween 2008 and projections for fiscal 2017, state education aid to Boston has fallen about $2 million, according to estimates from the mayor\u2019s office.\n\nOutside the State House, students donned stickers reading,\u201cMillion$ for GE, budget cuts for schools,\u201d a jab aimed at the tax breaks that helped lure corporate behemoth General Electric into leaving suburban Connecticut and moving its corporate headquarters to Boston\u2019s Seaport district.\n\nThousands of @BostonSchools students are protesting budget cuts outside the State House. #BPSwalkout pic.twitter.com/6Z2ycZtSeW \u2014 Only In Boston (@OnlyInBOS) March 7, 2016\n\n#bpswalkout is completely student organized, this is amazing to see. pic.twitter.com/XplyoQWcFr \u2014 Kevin Bogart (@Kevin_Bogart) March 7, 2016\n\nWalsh also talked about the effect that increasing the number of charter schools would have on future budgets. The privately run institutions are funded with taxpayer dollars. \u201cWe\u2019re having a walk-out in Boston Public Schools today because of a shortfall, and you\u2019re going to give us more charter schools without giving us the resources to pay for it?\u201d Walsh said. \u201cImagine what the budget problems will be in the next six or seven years; they\u2019ll be daunting.\u201d\n\nThe city plans to spend $1.27 billion on schools in fiscal 2017, a $13.5 million increase from the current year, according to information from the mayor\u2019s office. Baker in his $39.55 billion budget proposal allocated nearly $214 million to Boston from Chapter 70 education funding, an increase of about $1.3 million over the current year.\n\nFollowing his comments to the media, Walsh left the State House for Faneuil Hall, where he and Baker attended another press conference to promote a special Under 30 Summit planned for October and targeted at the city\u2019s young people. Students wound up marching to Faneuil Hall but Walsh left the area immediately after his press conference.\n\n@marty_walsh got directly into his car after press conference #bpswalkout pic.twitter.com/k7YTto2F3e \u2014 Maddie Kilgannon (@MaddieKilgannon) March 7, 2016\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.", "article_metadata": {"shareaholic": {"site_name": "NewBostonPost", "language": "en-US", "url": "http://newbostonpost.com/2016/03/07/hub-students-protest-budget-gap-as-walsh-testifies-on-charters/", "article_author_name": "Evan Lips", "image": "http://newbostonpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/BPS_March-cropped-e1457453556562.png", "site_id": "ab905d8abdbd23a369259b08e0927728", "shareable_page": "true", "keywords": "boston, budget, budget deficit, Charlie Baker, education, fiscal 2017, Marty Walsh, Massachusetts, politics, protest, schools, state aid"}, "description": "Boston Public Schools students climbed Beacon Hill Monday to protest proposed state education budget cuts as the Legislature\u2019s Joint Committee on Education", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"image": "http://newbostonpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/BPS_March-cropped-e1457453556562.png"}, "keywords": "boston,schools,protest,marty walsh,budget,budget deficit,charlie baker,education,fiscal 2017,massachusetts,politics,state aid", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1e2d\"", "article_summary": "Hub students protest budget gap as Walsh testifies on chartersPrinted from: http://newbostonpost.com/2016/03/07/hub-students-protest-budget-gap-as-walsh-testifies-on-charters/Boston students marched on Beacon Hill Monday.\nThousands of @BostonSchools students are protesting budget cuts outside the State House.\nStudents wound up marching to Faneuil Hall but Walsh left the area immediately after his press conference.\nWalsh said he was disappointed by what he described as \u201cmisinformation\u201d and criticized reports that the deficit had ballooned to $50 million.\nImmediately after he left the hearing room, a host of reporters surrounded the mayor to ask for comments on the rally outside and the city\u2019s school budget gap."}
