House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) on Wednesday dismissed the insinuation that Democrats are pivoting to income inequality to distract from the Affordable Care Act.

“With all due respect to my Republican colleagues, that is as political [a] statement as one could make,” Pelosi told NPR’s Diane Rehm on Wednesday. “CEO pay has increased but workers have plateaued out. It’s a right angle going in the wrong direction. This is an issue. Income disparity is something we must address.”

On the partisan fight over an extension of unemployment benefits, Pelosi indicated she would be amenable to an immediate three-month extension of the benefits that would give Congress some time to discuss a long-term solution without hurting those who rely on the federal aid.

“[R]arely have those benefits been paid for because people have paid into it as insurance,” she said. “However, I will say this: I think we should just pass a three month extension — and that’s what’s being discussed — and then in the course of that three months discuss how we approach the longer term, which is what we do over the next year.”

The unemployment insurance program giving federal assistance to 1.3 million jobless Americans expired Dec. 28, but Pelosi said she was “optimistic” after progress was made in the Senate on Tuesday.

“Let’s be optimistic. Let’s say [Tuesday] was a very positive day. Let’s see what suggestions people have. Let’s try to find common ground,” Pelosi said. “[L]et’s do it quickly and hopefully retroactively.”
