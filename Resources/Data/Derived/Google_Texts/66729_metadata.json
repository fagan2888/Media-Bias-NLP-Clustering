It was a difficult process for many of the residents, who had limited mobility and depended on wheelchairs or walkers in order to move around. Yet Hiller and her fellow residents also boarded that shuttle intending to exercise one of their most important rights as citizens \u2014 the shuttle was there to take them to a nearby polling place so that they could vote in a primary election.\n\nWhen Hiller arrived at the polls, however, she was told that she could not exercise her right to vote after all. Hiller was turned away because she did not have a photo ID, and Kansas has a strict voter ID law that disenfranchises voters without identification. Indeed, Kansas\u2019 voter ID law is so strict that it even prohibits voters from casting an absentee ballot unless they have ID.\n\nTo add insult to injury, Hiller was also denied the opportunity to cast a provisional ballot, something she is entitled to do even under the state\u2019s voter ID law, although it is doubtful that it would have made much of a difference if she had cast a provisional vote. Under Kansas\u2019 voter ID law, a voter who casts a provisional ballot because they lack photo ID must still show up at the local election office with identification before their ballot can be counted.\n\nAlthough voter ID\u2019s defenders frequently defend the laws as necessary to combat voter fraud at the polls, the reality is that such fraud is virtually non-existent. Indeed, just last week, a new study which surveyed the more than a billion votes cast in the United States between 2000 and 2014 found only 31 credible examples of impersonation at the polls. Meanwhile, even conservative estimates suggest voter ID laws prevent that between 2 and 3 percent of registered voters from casting a ballot.\n\nElderly voters like Hiller are particularly likely to be disenfranchised by voter ID laws, as they are less likely to have driver\u2019s licenses and may have little need for ID in their daily lives, especially if they spend most of their lives in a nursing care facility.\n\nYoung people, minorities and low-income voters are also especially likely to be disenfranchised by voter ID \u2014 all of which are groups that tend to lean further to the left than the electorate as a whole.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "And voter fraud at the polls is still only slightly more common than unicorns.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "And voter fraud at the polls is still only slightly more common than unicorns.", "title": "97 Year-Old Woman Denied The Right To Vote Because Of Voter ID", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2014/08/11/3469626/97-year-old-woman-denied-the-right-to-vote-because-of-voter-id/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Voter-ID-protest-e1399642792567.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "And voter fraud at the polls is still only slightly more common than unicorns.", "creator": "@imillhiser", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Voter-ID-protest-e1399642792567-321x214.jpg", "title": "97 Year-Old Woman Denied The Right To Vote Because Of Voter ID", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-justice", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Voter-ID-protest-e1399642792567.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Voter-ID-protest-e1399642792567.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-11T09:00:15+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/IanMillhiserPublic"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Indeed, Kansas\u2019 voter ID law is so strict that it even prohibits voters from casting an absentee ballot unless they have ID.\nJustice 97 Year-Old Woman Denied The Right To Vote Because Of Voter ID CREDIT: AP Photo/Marc LevyLast Tuesday, Beth Hiller, a 97 year-old nursing home resident from Topeka, Kansas, boarded a shuttle along with several other residents of the nursing home\u2019s health care unit.\nUnder Kansas\u2019 voter ID law, a voter who casts a provisional ballot because they lack photo ID must still show up at the local election office with identification before their ballot can be counted.\nHiller was turned away because she did not have a photo ID, and Kansas has a strict voter ID law that disenfranchises voters without identification.\nMeanwhile, even conservative estimates suggest voter ID laws prevent that between 2 and 3 percent of registered voters from casting a ballot."}
