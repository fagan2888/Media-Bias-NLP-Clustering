And the law says that states may \u201celect\u201d to establish an exchange and that if they don\u2019t, HHS shall establish and operate \u201csuch an exchange.\u201d Thus the federal exchange is the equivalent of a state exchange.\n\nAnother section also says the administration shall ensure that residents of each state shall have access to the tax credits.\n\nWhen the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals looked at the case before it, it gave credence to both sides and that\u2019s what made the difference that led to its deference to the IRS rules.\n\nIn the court\u2019s opinion, the government had the stronger position, \u201calthough only slightly.\u201d The court couldn\u2019t discern what Congress intended, so it concluded the IRS interpretation was a permissible interpretation of statutory sections that appear to be in conflict.\n\nThis all of course fits into the Republican narrative about how the law was too big, too complex and too rushed for anyone to understand.\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising that as large an undertaking as health care reform would require complex legislation of more than 900 pages. Or that there would be drafting glitches, given the pressures of getting a bill through the Senate, the House and conference committee reconciliation.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not surprising that there\u2019s a legal question over the meaning of the language.\n\nThe Supreme Court will have to decide whether the statue is ambiguous enough that it is reasonable to defer to the judgment of the agencies charged with implementing it.\n\nWhat\u2019s not ambiguous is why the Republican strategists have embraced the cases as a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre encapsulating all that has filled their narrative about the evils of Obamacare. The cases are clearly attempts to undermine the law.\n\nWhile their rhetoric says members of Congress didn\u2019t know what they were voting for, they argue in court that Congress knew exactly what it was saying.\n\nAsk yourself, if the intent were to limit the subsidies, why weren\u2019t all those despised liberal Democrats handing out gifts to the poor complaining about the limitation?\n\nSteven Brill, founder of Court TV and author of a new book on health care in the U.S., \u201cAmerica\u2019s Bitter Pill,\u201d has observed that \u201cno legislator or staff member on either side of the aisle that I spoke with ever thought that the subsidies would not go to the states using the federal exchange, and that the confusion and inconsistency in the wording was the result of some last-minute cutting and pasting of a phrase from a prior draft.\u201d\n\nThe courts might say that if Congress intended something different than what the law says, then Congress can fix it. But, when one party is unanimously opposed to the bill and is more interested in repealing it than fixing or replacing it, that\u2019s not realistic. Without the subsidies and without a fix, it will indeed undermine the Affordable Care Act\u2019s objective of providing affordable health insurance to as many as possible.\n\nThe intent of those who want to interpret the law to limit the subsidies isn\u2019t to make the law live up to its original intent; the intent is to interpret the law in a way that destroys that original intent.\n\nRon Eachus of Salem is a former legislator and a former chairman of the Oregon Public Utility Commission.
