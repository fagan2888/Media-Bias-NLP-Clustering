DALLAS (CBSDFW.COM) – Speaking in front of a crowd of a 15,000 people at the American Airlines Center in Downtown Dallas, Donald Trump targeted North Texas voters just days before a crucial Republican debate.

Trump spoke to the crowd for more than an hour. He spent the first minutes jabbing the media, discussing polls and his unlikely rise in politics and as a contender for president.

“It’s disgusting what’s happening to our country. We are a dumping ground for the rest of the world. We are. We are,” said Trump.

Trump continued on his speech by first attacking the current politicians who are running the country. Minutes later, he quickly shifted gears to his most controversial topic… the Mexican border.

“It’s a massive problem. We have to stop illegal immigration. We have to do it,” said Trump.

Trump received a standing ovation as he made it clear that he wants to build a wall along the border. The billionaire also targeted women voters on Monday. Two well-known conservative, female figures spoke just before Trump took the stage.

“I have such respect for women. I cherish women. I’m going to take such good care of women’s healthcare issues you won’t even believe it. But I’m surging with women,” said Trump.

Among other issues, Trump also promised to lower taxes and to take on the Affordable Care Act.

“Obamacare. We’re going to repel it, we’re going to replace it, get something great. Repeal it, replace it, get something great!” yelled Trump.

Supporters feel Trump’s strong word will stack up well against his opponents.

“I’ll tell you what, I think the rest of them are shaking in their boots and they ought to be,” said William Baldwin, who drove from Gainesville to hear Trump speak.

Trump will soon head to Los Angeles and prepare for Wednesday’s debate.
