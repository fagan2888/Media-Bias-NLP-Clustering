The following are excerpts of remarks made today on the floor of the House of Representatives by Rep. Chris Smith (R-NJ) about H.R.7, No Taxpayer Funding Act.\n\nHR 7 seeks to accomplish three important goals:\n\n1. Make the Hyde Amendment and other current abortion funding prohibitions permanent;\n\n2. Ensure that the Affordable Care Act faithfully conforms with the Hyde Amendment as promised by the President;\n\n3. Provide full disclosure, transparency and the prominent display of the extent to which any health insurance plan on the exchange funds abortion.\n\nMr. Speaker, the President of the United States stood just 10 feet from where I stand in September 2009 and told a joint session of Congress that \u201cunder our plan, no federal dollars will be used to fund abortion.\u201d\n\nOn March 24, 2010, President Obama issued an executive order that said the Affordable Care Act \u201cmaintains current Hyde Amendment restrictions governing abortion policy and extends those restrictions to newly created health insurance exchanges.\u201d\n\nWe now know that\u2019s not true at all. The ACA does not extend Hyde Amendment restrictions to the newly created health insurance exchanges.\n\nAs my colleagues will recall, the Hyde Amendment has two parts. It prohibits direct funding for abortion and bans funding for any insurance coverage that includes abortion except in the cases of rape, incest or to save the life of the mother.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, massive amounts of public funds in the form of tax credits \u2013 $796 billion in direct spending over 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) \u2013 will pay for insurance plans, many, perhaps most of which will include elective abortion. That massively violates the Hyde Amendment.\n\nWe have learned that every single Obamacare plan in Connecticut and Rhode Island includes abortion on demand.\n\nIn my own state of New Jersey, my staff and I have learned after a great deal of work that of the 31 plans offered in the state, at least 14 plans subsidize abortion on demand. Yet none of the plans make this information available to the consumer shopping online. This is the case in state after state.\n\nTo further understand how the ACA expands public funding for abortion, my colleagues don\u2019t have to look any further than the DC Health Link\u2014our own portal for health insurance. Of the 112 health insurance plans available to members of congress and staff only nine exclude elective abortion. 103 plans\u2014over 90%\u2013subsidize abortion on demand. About 75% of our insurance premiums are subsidized by the taxpayer so the taxpayer is clearly being compelled to subsidize elective abortions.\n\nMr. Speaker, since some health insurance plans offered on the exchange have already been purchased, HR7\u2014just like the Hyde Amendment\u2014makes the elimination of public funding for abortion except in the cases of rape, incest or to save the life of the mother, applicable in the ACA next year\u2014beginning on January 1, 2015, at the start of a new contract year.\n\nSo in the meantime, in order to ensure robust transparency, HR7 adds a major new provision requiring full disclosure and prominent display of \u201cthe extent of coverage\u201d of abortion, if any, and separate disclosure of any abortion surcharge.\n\nObamacare requires premium payers to be assessed a separate abortion surcharge every month to pay for abortions. We have learned that consumers may never know they are paying the surcharge, despite assurances to the contrary when the ACA was passed.\n\nIn 2009, Senator Ben Nelson said\n\n\u201cif you are receiving Federal assistance to buy insurance, and if that plan has any abortion coverage, the insurance company must bill you separately, and you must pay separately from your own personal funds\u2013perhaps a credit card transaction, your separate personal check, or automatic withdrawal from your bank account\u2013for that abortion coverage. Now, let me say that again. You have to write two checks: one for the basic policy and one for the additional coverage for abortion.\u201d\n\nHowever, research published by the National Right to Life Committee (NRLC) indicates that insurance carriers are not actually billing the surcharge separately at all. In fact, Gretchen Borchelt, director of state reproductive health policy at the National Women\u2019s Law Center, told the Huffington Post that \u201cwe used to talk about it as being two checks that the consumer would have to write because of the segregation requirements, but that\u2019s not the way it\u2019s being implemented.\u201d\n\nFinally, Mr. Speaker, because abortion brutally dismembers, decapitates or chemically poisons an unborn child to death, Americans have consistently demanded that public funds not pay for abortion.\n\nA huge majority\u2014well over 60%\u2013according to most polls show that women and men in this country don\u2019t want to be complicit in abortion by subsidizing it. A December 2009 Quinnipiac poll found 72% opposed to \u201callowing abortions to be paid for by public funds under a health reform bill.\u201d\n\nAnother poll by International Communications Research asked \u201cIf the choice were up to you, would you want your own insurance policy to include abortion?\u201d 69% of women said no!\n\nMr. Speaker, that\u2019s because an ever growing number of people recognize that abortion isn\u2019t health care\u2014it kills babies and harms women.\n\nWe live in an age of ultrasound imaging\u2014the ultimate window to the womb and the child who resides there. We are in the midst of a fetal health care revolution, an explosion of benign interventions designed to diagnose, treat and cure the precious lives of these youngest patients.\n\nHR 7 will help save lives and will reduce abortions.\n\nThe Judiciary Committee Report accompanying HR 7 suggests that the Hyde Amendment has saved over a million children because 1 in 4 women who would have procured an abortion don\u2019t go through with it if public funding isn\u2019t available.\n\nHR 7 will reduce abortions. HR 7 will help save lives.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://www.nationalrighttolifenews.org/news/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/ChrisSmith41re.jpg"}, "bitly-verification": "3d313669c834"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1507\"", "article_summary": "Ensure that the Affordable Care Act faithfully conforms with the Hyde Amendment as promised by the President;3.\nMake the Hyde Amendment and other current abortion funding prohibitions permanent;2.\nThe ACA does not extend Hyde Amendment restrictions to the newly created health insurance exchanges.\nThat massively violates the Hyde Amendment.\nProvide full disclosure, transparency and the prominent display of the extent to which any health insurance plan on the exchange funds abortion."}
