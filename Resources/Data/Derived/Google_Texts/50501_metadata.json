Santa Monica-based Macerich is the nation\u2019s third largest mall owner.\n\n* Source: Macerich Co.\n\nSimon CEO David Simon said in a news release Monday that Macerich has refused to discuss his company\u2019s acquisition proposal despite \u201centhusiastic support\u201d for the combination voiced by overlapping shareholders. He also stated that Simon has outperformed Macerich in key operating and financial categories, including sales per square foot, which is a barometer of a retailer\u2019s efficiency in creating revenue. Sales per square foot is the average revenue generated for every square foot of sales space.\n\nSimon has not included a breakdown of its properties\u2019 sales per square foot in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, so it\u2019s not known what the sales per square foot have been at the Camarillo Premium Outlets.\n\nRobust sales per square foot have been reported in Macerich\u2019s annual public filings with respect to The Oaks and Pacific View mall.\n\nThe Oaks reported $512 sales per square foot last year, and Pacific View reported $405 sales per square foot.\n\nUsing a mall quality assessment chart developed by the real estate research and advisory firm Green Street Advisors, The Oaks\u2019 sales figures qualify for between an \u201cA-\u201d and \u201cA\u201d grade, meaning it should perform at a high level for the foreseeable future.\n\nPacific View mall would get between a \u201cB\u201d and \u201cB+\u201d grade under Green Street Advisors\u2019 assessment. \u201cB\u201d grade properties are considered \u201cstable and adequately serve their target shopper in a given area,\u201d according to Green Street.\n\nMalls that are at a competitive disadvantage with their long-term viability in question are given \u201cC\u201d grades by Green Street Advisors and have sales per square foot are under $310.\n\nThe success of The Oaks and Pacific View mall likely has to do with the area\u2019s wealth, said Dan Hamilton, director of economics at California Lutheran University.\n\n\u201cThe people who tend to live in the coastal California zone are more wealthy because they have to be to be here,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you have more wealth, that\u2019s going to boost your sales per square foot. A second factor is that it\u2019s likely that coastal California gets more tourism than certain areas in the middle of the country.\u201d\n\nMore tourism also translates into more dollars per square foot, he said.\n\nRepresentatives for The Oaks and Pacific View mall did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe Pacific View mall\u2019s anchor tenants are JCPenney, Sears, Target and Macy\u2019s. Target opened at the mall in 2008 with the hope that it would revitalize the mall\u2019s north end, filling space formerly occupied by Robinsons-May, which closed in 2006.\n\nThe Oaks mall underwent a $250 million renovation and expansion beginning in early 2007. The interior spaces and the exterior fa\u00e7ade were remodeled and a 138,000-square-foot Nordstrom was constructed. Anchor tenants at The Oaks are JCPenney, Macy\u2019s, Macy\u2019s Men\u2019s & Home and Nordstrom.\n\nBruce Stenslie, president and CEO of the Economic Development Collaborative of Ventura County was impressed that Macerich bankrolled The Oaks\u2019 significant remodeling project during the recession.\n\n\u201cThey really invested when nobody else was,\u201d he said. \u201cThat may be a payoff for them. Macerich has always seemed to be pretty successful.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"title": "Macerich-owned malls in Ventura County are healthy, filings show", "og": {"url": "http://www.vcstar.com/business/macerich-owned-malls-in-ventura-county-are-healthy-filings-show-ep-980508332-347964381.html", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/pacificviewmall_14734881_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "height": 429}, "type": "article", "description": "At a time when many brick-and-mortar centers are struggling to compete with online retailers, sales figures show two local malls are healthy.", "title": "Macerich-owned malls in Ventura County are healthy, filings show"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/pacificviewmall_14734881_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "description": "At a time when many brick-and-mortar centers are struggling to compete with online retailers, sales figures show two local malls are healthy.", "site": "https://twitter.com/vcstar", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Macerich-owned malls in Ventura County are healthy, filings show"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-vcs-icon-144.png", "__sync_contentCategory": "premium", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd88fb\"", "article_summary": "Sales per square foot is the average revenue generated for every square foot of sales space.\nThe Oaks reported $512 sales per square foot last year, and Pacific View reported $405 sales per square foot.\nRobust sales per square foot have been reported in Macerich\u2019s annual public filings with respect to The Oaks and Pacific View mall.\nThe Pacific View mall\u2019s anchor tenants are JCPenney, Sears, Target and Macy\u2019s.\nRepresentatives for The Oaks and Pacific View mall did not respond to requests for comment."}
