Jaelah Fields builds a bike with help from Tim Holder, a Barclays Center volunteer. Andrew Hinderaker for The Wall Street Journal It was no ordinary Monday for 50 local schoolchildren who spent the afternoon building bicycles in the lobby of Barclays Center in Brooklyn.

Between the excitement and breaks for cookies, the children, ages 6-10, were focused on assembling bicycle parts with the help of 100 volunteers, parents and bike mechanics from Ride Brooklyn.

“They tricked me!” Jadari Georges, 8 years old, said when he found out he was going to get to keep the bike he built.

And that wasn’t the only surprise. Professional BMX rider Nigel Sylvester and Nets players Jerome Jordan, Deron Williams, Jorge Gutierrez and Jarrett Jack also visited the children and helped fine-tune the final touches on the two-wheelers.

Eight-year-old Iris, who didn’t give her last name, said she isn’t really a Nets fan. But she couldn’t stop smiling as she put the finishing touches on her bike and posed for pictures with Mr. Williams with her mom, Beatrice, who proudly sported a Nets jacket.

Mr. Jordan, at 7 feet, towered over the children as they scurried to have their bikes checked and get autographs with him and the other players.

“It’s always good when you can help out children,” Mr. Jordan said. “Especially during the festive season.”

The bikes were donated by the Nets and helmets were donated by Bell Helmets.
