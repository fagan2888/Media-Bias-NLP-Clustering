That was his ambition: to be more, as he put it, like Ronald Reagan than Bill Clinton, to launch a new era, not simply tack to the prevailing winds of the old.\n\nNot surprisingly, as the president readies his final State of the Union Address, the issue is contested. Liberals like New York Times op-ed columnist Paul Krugman hail Obama as \u201cone of the most consequential and, yes, successful presidents in American history.\u201d Conservatives scorn his administration as a \u201csocialist\u201d interlude in a conservative time. On the left, many like Professor Cornel West are disappointed, seeing Obama as a \u201ccounterfeit\u201d progressive who failed to seize a historic opportunity for progressive change.\n\nWhat makes a president transformational? The first African-American president is inherently historic. Obama\u2019s cheerleaders tick off his big accomplishments, as well: healthcare reform; the 2009 fiscal stimulus that helped save the economy; more than 14 million jobs created in a record stretch of 70 months of growth; progressive tax reforms; progress on climate change; the nuclear deal with Iran; the move to normalize relations with Cuba, and more.\n\nSceptics note that his era may be called the \u201cLong Depression\u201d rather than the \u201cGreat Recession.\u201d They say the Obama administration brought us worsening inequality; stagnant incomes; bigger banks; greater big-money corruption of U.S. politics and governance; decaying public infrastructure; accelerating catastrophic climate change; and the United States mired in endless wars, facing off against Russia and China and draining its coffers trying to police the world.\n\nThe presidents widely celebrated as transformational \u2014 William McKinley, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Reagan \u2014 all got big things done. But no president \u2014 even Roosevelt with his four terms \u2014 can be expected to realize a complete reform agenda. Real reforms are necessary but not sufficient to be a transformational president: He has to change the course of the nation.\n\nThat requires not only new policies but also framing and winning the ideological argument. It requires not only winning the presidency, but also helping to forge an enduring majority coalition that can sustain the era.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nObama is the first Democratic president to be elected and re-elected with a majority of the popular vote since Roosevelt. He both personifies and has helped to forge a new and growing majority coalition for progressive reform. Pollster Stan Greenberg has dubbed this coalition of millennials, people of colour and single women the \u201crising American electorate.\u201d Political analyst Bill Schneider calls it the \u201cnew America.\u201d\n\nIn Greenberg\u2019s book, America Ascendant: A Revolutionary Nation\u2019s Path to Addressing Its Deepest Problems and Leading the 21st Century, he estimates that the rising American electorate will constitute 54 percent of the electorate in 2016 (63 percent if you include \u201cseculars,\u201d those with no religious practice). And the two-thirds of those that show up at the polls will likely vote for the Democratic presidential nominee.\n\nYet the scope, durability and thrust of this coalition are still uncertain. Under Obama, the Democrats have lost control of the U.S. Senate and the House of Representatives. Republicans have gained 913 state-legislative seats since 2010, control 30 state-legislative chambers and rule virtually unchallenged in states across the South, Great Plains and Rocky Mountains.\n\nThe turnout of the new America coalition plummeted in the mid-term elections. It remains to be seen whether the next Democratic presidential nominee can bring them to the polls as successfully as Obama did. No progressive reform era can flourish if the White House is an isolated island amid a sea of reaction.\n\nA transformational president has to infuse his majority coalition with a clear direction. By framing the ideological argument, he or she must help Americans understand how they got in the fix they are in and what must be done to get them out of it. The measure of ideological victory isn\u2019t simply that Democratic officeholders, activists and voters understand and enlist, but also that the opposing party finds it must adjust to the new arguments to survive.\n\nPresident Dwight D. Eisenhower could succeed Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman \u2014 but only by embracing Social Security and the New Deal economic reforms. Clinton succeeded Reagan and George H.W. Bush \u2014 but felt it necessary to declare the era of big government over. Clinton joined Congress in deregulating finance and corporations and repealing welfare as it was practiced. He ushered in an era of mass incarceration by launching a tough \u201cwar on crime.\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s record in the ideological debate is mixed. On his watch, the \u201cwedge issues\u201d that once strongly favoured Republicans \u2014 gay marriage, crime, guns and even abortion \u2014 began to favour Democrats. When the White House glowed rainbow to celebrate the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s acceptance of gay marriage, it symbolized a Democratic Party confident that its social liberalism is on the march.\n\nStill, gay activists, Black Lives Matter and Latino organizers would argue that Obama has been a laggard, rather than a leader, on their concerns. But there is no question that his victory symbolized and accelerated the changes, and he has responded when movements opened up the political space.\n\nOn economic policy, Obama celebrators and detractors argue that he has extended the power of the state more than any president since Lyndon B. Johnson and his Great Society. Obama\u2019s list is indeed impressive: an unprecedented economic stimulus; rescue of the auto industry; use of executive authority to address climate change; banking re-regulation, and 17 million more Americans with healthcare insurance because of the Affordable Care Act. He raised tax rates on the wealthy by largely letting the top-end George W. Bush tax cuts expire.\n\nBut at the beginning of his administration, in the middle of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, Obama was essentially AWOL in the ideological debate. He consciously chose not to \u201clitigate the past.\u201d He did not grasp the moment to educate the public on how the United States got into such a mess; he didn\u2019t explain the economic fundamentals and the need for a bold reform agenda.\n\nObama\u2019s signature appeal, he believed, was being above partisan divides. Promising to \u201cchange the culture of Washington,\u201d he insisted that he could bring the country together to find common ground. His economic stimulus, however, was weakened dramatically when he accepted Republican tax cuts in a vain effort to win bipartisan support.\n\nHe undercut his argument for more public investment to get the U.S. economy out of the crisis by arguing, only a few months after his stimulus bill passed, that government must \u201ctighten its belt.\u201d He assembled the risible Simpson-Bowles commission to focus national attention on deficit reduction.\n\nLater, Obama nearly signed a wrong-headed \u201cgrand bargain\u201d with Republicans that would have cut Social Security and Medicare in the cause of deficit reduction. He was saved, however, by Republican aversion to any form of tax hike. Conservatives\u2019 austerity policies continued to erode public investment in areas vital to America\u2019s future. And public opinion grew ever more sceptical of government\u2019s competence.\n\nObama\u2019s Wall Street and fiscal reforms were similarly compromised. Dodd-Frank left banking more concentrated than ever, and no major banker went to jail for what the FBI called the \u201cepidemic of fraud\u201d that contributed to the housing bust. He continued ruinous corporate-defined free-trade policies.\n\nHis healthcare reform, declared radical by the GOP, was modelled on a Heritage Foundation proposal adopted by Mitt Romney when he was Massachusetts governor. Obama refused to take on the drug companies over their exorbitant pricing, and he would not support a public healthcare option that might have put real checks on insurance-company abuses.\n\nThough Obama spoke out against the Supreme Court\u2019s Citizens United decision, which opened the floodgates to corporate money in U.S. elections, he spent little political capital trying to curb money in politics. In fact, his decision to forego public financing in his 2008 presidential campaign essentially marked the end of that reform effort.\n\nObama\u2019s first-term floundering fuelled a revolt on his political left. Occupy Wall Street spread across the nation with its indictment of the 1 percent, which put inequality at the centre of the U.S. public debate. The Elizabeth Warren-Bernie Sanders progressive/liberal wing of the Democratic Party exposed how the rich \u201crigged the rules,\u201d spotlighted the Obama administration\u2019s revolving door to Wall Street and demanded tougher reform. The Congressional Progressive Caucus laid out a budget that combined bold \u2014 and long overdue \u2014 public investments with progressive tax reforms.\n\nIn the run-up to his 2012 re-election campaign, Obama embraced some of these themes, particularly income inequality. Now, as any hope of bipartisan cooperation has faded, he has been bolder at using his executive authority and more willing to use his \u201cbully pulpit\u201d in the cause of reform. But the task of interpreting the moment, explaining it and winning the public debate remains unfinished.\n\nHis failure of vision is even more apparent in foreign policy. Obama won the 2008 Democratic nomination due, to a significant degree, to public dismay about the war in Iraq, which Hillary Clinton, his opponent, had voted for. He clearly hoped to extricate the United States from the wars in the Middle East and Afghanistan and bring the inflated war on terror into perspective.\n\nYet he again chose not to litigate the past. He failed to offer a different vision and global strategy. His troop surge in Afghanistan turned out to be a trap. He reluctantly intervened in Libya and Syria. Though he withdrew troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, he expanded the use of drones. He allowed neo-conservatives to drag him into raising tensions with Russia, even while beginning to confront the Chinese in the South China Sea.\n\nU.S. Special Forces were active in more than 100 countries in 2015. If anything, Obama has expanded, rather than limited, the national-security claims of executive prerogative and extended surveillance and secrecy. The nuclear agreement with Iran and the easing of relations with Cuba hint at a different course. But one swallow does not make the spring.\n\nNo one president, even after two terms, can consolidate a new era. Obama\u2019s successor will significantly affect history\u2019s judgment of his presidency. If a Republican is elected president with a Republican-controlled Congress, Obama may well be seen as having lost the argument for reform. If a Democrat is elected, it will be left to him or her to interpret the moment for Americans, and to engage them in a bold reform agenda.\n\nThat Clinton has found it necessary to compete with Sanders by putting forth more activist and populist positions consolidates the thrust of the party. If a Democrat is elected president and successfully drives more reform, Obama will properly be judged as setting the stage for it. But if he or she is unsuccessful because of an obstructionist Congress, timid vision, economic woes or foreign calamities, Obama\u2019s successor could end up discrediting progressive reform before it had the opportunity to fully take hold.\n\nZhou Enlai was once asked what he thought about the French Revolution. He reportedly replied, \u201cToo soon to tell.\u201d\n\nWill Obama be considered a transformational president?
