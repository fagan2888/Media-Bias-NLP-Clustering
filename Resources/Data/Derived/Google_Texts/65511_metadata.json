But they haven't happened yet, and if they do, conservatives can blame Republicans.\n\nThe latest \u201cnews\u201d out of the conservative blogosphere is that President Obama is launching an attack on military families. How? By closing commissaries\u2014grocery stores that offer food and other products at a discount to service-members, veterans, and their families.\n\n\u201cObama\u2019s wasting billions on food stamps, Obamacare and every other boondoggle you can imagine, but he has no qualms about sticking it to dirt poor soldiers,\u201d wrote one blogger for the Rightwing News website. Likewise, a writer at the RightScoop complains that \u201cThis administration wants the military to take it on the chin but if you talk about cutting one of their social programs that\u2019s littered with waste and abuse they cry bloody murder.\u201d\n\nI grew up in a military family\u2014both of my parents served in the Navy\u2014and can attest to the value of commissaries, which offer big savings (upwards of 30 percent) to shoppers. If the administration were targeting the stores for cuts, it would be hugely disappointing, especially since it wouldn\u2019t gain much for the trouble; the 248 commissaries in the United States and abroad receive $1.4 billion in funding.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing though: There is no \u201cplan\u201d to cut the commissary system.\n\nAt most, the Pentagon has floated this as one way to meet sequestration, which leaves its budget at $475 billion for fiscal year 2014, which is $20 billion less than what it receives under the most recent continuing resolution, and $50 billion less than it\u2019s budget request. And even if the administration decides to reduce funding for commissaries, it still needs approval from Congress.\n\nThese aren\u2019t imminent cuts, and they don\u2019t come from a place of anti-military antipathy. Indeed, if conservatives want to know why they\u2019re even on the table, they should look at a mirror.\n\nPresident Obama never wanted the sequester. It was a product of Republican brinksmanship over the debt ceiling, and a near-fanatical desire for spending cuts. The idea was that Republicans would find across-the-board cuts so objectionable that they would agree to a \u201cgrand bargain\u201d on long-term deficit reduction. But it backfired; GOP lawmakers\u2014and House Republicans in particular\u2014were content with the cuts, and unwilling to accept higher taxes (key to the president\u2019s alternative) as the price for a deal. And given the extent to which social programs have been cut to the bone\u2014the oft-cited waste is rare\u2014the military is one of the few places where the government can reduce discretionary spending.\n\nIn other words, if conservatives are unhappy with the effects of sequestration\u2014which could include commissary cuts\u2014they should direct their anger away from Obama, and towards the Republicans who forced the situation in the first place. Anything less is refusing to take responsibility for the large spending cuts that they\u2019ve pushed for the last three years.\n\nIt should be said that this refusal to deal with consequences has become a regular feature of conservatism. For as much as they\u2019re devoted to repealing the Affordable Care Act, few Republican lawmakers have offered an alternative to the law. In the extraordinary event that the shutdown successfully defunded Obamacare, what did Ted Cruz and the GOP have to offer uninsured Americans and others who suffered under the health care status quo ante? Nothing.\n\nThe same was true of this summer\u2019s debacle over the farm bill. Republican opposition to food stamps doomed the legislation, but GOP leaders in the House placed the blame on the Democratic minority. \u201cI\u2019m extremely disappointed that Nancy Pelosi and Democratic leadership have at the last minute chosen to derail years of bipartisan work on the Farm Bill and related reforms,\u201d said House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, apparently oblivious to the fact that conservative intransigence killed the bill.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "@jbouie"}, "keywords": "U.S. Politics", "publicationDate": 201312041628, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/voxbox/jamelle-bouie", "description": "Thanks to the sequester, the Pentagon has floated cuts to grocery stores for military families.
