For the elderly, that's not the case,\" Greenlee said. \"These people are frail and often have cognitive impairment. It's the rest of us who need to raise the voice for them.\u201d\n\nNumbers provided by the National Center on Elder Abuse, which is part of the Administration on Aging overseen by Greenlee, show that as many as 10 percent of elderly people suffer from abuse at least once per year. That number does not include financial exploitation, which is an increasingly common form of elder abuse.\n\nLearn Ten Surprising Facts about Alzheimer's Disease \u00bb\n\nThe New York State Elder Abuse Study in 2010 showed that 41 out of 1,000 elderly people surveyed reported \u201cmajor\u201d financial exploitation, a higher rate than other forms of abuse, including neglect and emotional, physical, or sexual abuse.\n\n\u201cPeople think [abuse] is isolated, and only in nursing homes,\u201d Greenlee said. \u201cIn fact, it is broad and widespread, and it's often family members.\u201d\n\nFamily Members Are Often Perpetrators\n\nSixteen years ago, the National Center on Elder Abuse conducted the only national study ever of the scope of elder abuse. That report showed that 90 percent of abusers are family members. Greenlee said it remains one of the fastest-growing aspects of elder abuse, a problem that is snowballing as America ages.\n\nIn 2010, people 65 and older made up 13 percent of the population, according to the U.S. Census. By 2050, that number is expected to reach 20 percent.\n\nThe Weinberg Center for Elder Abuse Prevention at Hebrew Home Riverdale in New York teamed up with the doormen's union long ago to train them on what to look for in cases of elder abuse. But a recent grant has allowed them to expand the program and train workers at other New York City agencies, such as Meals on Wheels.\n\nJoy Solomon, director of Hebrew Home, told Healthline that they are working with the union to expand the program up and down the Eastern seaboard. Elderly people often become isolated, and most do not report incidents of abuse, he said.\n\n\u201cI think isolation is a key component of how abusers continue the abuse,\u201d Solomon said. \u201cIt's the engine that enables it. The doormen are in a very unique position to help identify risky situations, as well as situations that may already be occurring. They're also a very caring group of people.\u201d\n\nKnow the Signs and Symptoms of Geriatric Depression \u00bb\n\nBut nationwide, many elderly people do not live in urban high-rises with doormen, and exploitation of the elderly remains a serious problem. Unlike children, who are protected against abuse by a federal organization, the elderly are often left to fend for themselves.\n\n\u201cI think people falsely assume we have created a federal infrastructure,\u201d Greenlee said of state-run Adult Protective Services programs. \u201cThis is not Child Protective Services. We do not have sufficient services.\u201d\n\nFunding remains the biggest hurdle to ramping up federal programs for the elderly. The Elder Justice Coordinating Council was established in 2009 as part of the Affordable Care Act. The group has made several recommendations for increased federal involvement to curtail elder abuse, including:\n\nLaunching an elder justice website and creating a national resource center for investigating and prosecuting elder abuse\n\nDeveloping a national Adult Protective Services system\n\nHelping financial institutions like banks detect financial abuse\n\nA Florida Family Torn Apart\n\nBryan Mingle of Jacksonville, Fla., knows all about financial exploitation of the elderly. He moved across the country four years ago to care for his parents after his brother went to prison for stealing from them.\n\nHis brother, who is nearing retirement age himself, served as a caregiver to his parents, but was caught forging his father's checks.\n\nLearn More: The Symptoms Seniors Can't Afford to Ignore \u00bb\n\nThe state aggressively prosecuted Mingle's brother, who was recently released. He has been treated for drug and alcohol addiction and has been sober for four years.\n\n\u201cI hope my brother can make amends by changing his life and being there now for our mom,\u201d Mingle said. \u201cIt can happen.\"\n\nMingle's father died while his brother was incarcerated. Both parents went to the same nursing home after his brother's arrest. Both suffered from dementia and other ailments.\n\n\u201cLaw enforcement has to be an equal partner with human services, and bring attention [to the fact] that this is a crime,\u201d Greenlee said of such situations. \u201cPeople with dementia make great witnesses because it is so clear they have been taken advantage of because of their cognitive impairment.\u201d\n\nTips for Spotting Elder Abuse\n\nThe New York Stock Exchange responded favorably last week to a growing online company that matches families with screened caregivers. Stock in Care.com, in its initial public offering, soared 43 percent on Friday, closing at $23.40 a share.\n\nCare.com can help people find caregivers for their pets and children, as well as seniors. Jody Gastfriend, vice president of senior care services for Care.com, told Healthline that the business has grown internationally as many countries begin to provide more services for seniors.\n\nShe offers these tips for spotting elder abuse:\n\nGet to know a senior well enough to establish a baseline for mood, behavior, and personality. Without that, you can't tell when something's wrong.\n\nIf an elderly person becomes withdrawn or mistrustful, or develops a relationship with one trusted person to the exclusion of others, 'that's a real red flag.'\n\nIf a senior suddenly becomes secretive about finances, something might be awry.\n\nFind Out Why Healthy Eating Is so Important for Seniors \u00bb", "article_metadata": {"standout": "http://www.healthline.com/health-news/senior-elder-abuse-more-common-than-you-think-012714", "news_keywords": "elder abuse, NYC doormen, Kathy Greenlee, National Center on Elder Abuse, Hebrew Home Riverdale, Affordable Care Act, signs of elder abuse", "og": {"site_name": "Healthline", "description": "As an aging nation grapples with elder abuse, a patchwork of state and local organizations are on the front lines.", "title": "U.S. Official: Elder Abuse Is 'Broad and Widespread'", "url": "http://www.healthline.com/health-news/senior-elder-abuse-more-common-than-you-think-012714", "image": "http://www.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/aging/elderabuse.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/aging/elderabuse.jpg", "description": "As an aging nation grapples with elder abuse, a patchwork of state and local organizations are on the front lines.", "card": "summary", "title": "U.S. Official: Elder Abuse Is 'Broad and Widespread'"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP", "DC.date.issued": "2014-01-27", "fb": {"app_id": 239371929577489}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "As an aging nation grapples with elder abuse, a patchwork of state and local organizations are on the front lines."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe025f\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIn fact, it is broad and widespread, and it's often family members.\u201dFamily Members Are Often PerpetratorsSixteen years ago, the National Center on Elder Abuse conducted the only national study ever of the scope of elder abuse.\nThe Weinberg Center for Elder Abuse Prevention at Hebrew Home Riverdale in New York teamed up with the doormen's union long ago to train them on what to look for in cases of elder abuse.\nGreenlee said it remains one of the fastest-growing aspects of elder abuse, a problem that is snowballing as America ages.\nThat number does not include financial exploitation, which is an increasingly common form of elder abuse.\nBut although this group has joined a small army of other organizations working to prevent elder abuse, statistics show that this type of victimization is more common than ever."}
