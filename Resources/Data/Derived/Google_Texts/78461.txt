Real life action figure Pharrell Williams never seems to slow down. He has been a virtual whirlwind of activity since his career start in 1992 when he formed a production company, The Neptunes, with his childhood friend, Chad Hugo, to promote and sell the work of hip-hop, R&B and pop artists. Now at age 40 and having followed his dream, Williams has an estimated net worth of $80 million and he’s still gaining speed with multiple projects in various stages of completion. His creative energy spans singing, songwriting, record production, fashion designing and even furniture.

All other awards aside, in 2014 alone, Pharrell Williams won four Grammys, out of eight nominations. He won the Grammy for Producer of the Year, Album of the Year, Record of the Year and Best Group Performance.

Known for the hats he wears, he just auctioned his big Oscar hat to raise money for his charity, From One Hand to Another, an organization that Pharrell founded to benefit underserved children – starting in his own community. Arby’s Restaurants won the bid at $44,100.

The Brickell Avenue penthouse he just put on the market is a testament to Williams’ talent in design. Located 40 stories above Biscayne Bay atop Bristol Tower, the 10,000-square-foot penthouse has five bedrooms, seven bathrooms and an additional 5,000 square feet of terraces with its own rooftop swimming pool and a second level summer kitchen. He purchased the condo in 2007 for $12.525 million, then transformed it into a mogul palace with his art and furniture collection. Views take in bay, ocean and Key Biscayne. The terrace is the perfect place to put your feet up with a cocktail and watch the parade of cruise ships Friday evenings as they head past Key Biscayne to their island ports of call.

Grammy winning, Academy Award nominated Pherrell Williams’s Miami penthouse is now listed at $10.999 million.
