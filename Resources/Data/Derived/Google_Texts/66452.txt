Oklahoma City Schools Superintendent Rob Neu has responded to reports he is planning to resign.

On Tuesday morning, Neu issued a brief statement to the media and emailed the same thing to staff, saying simply, "I have not resigned. I am very disappointed that this was reported in the news media. I have no further comment at this time."

On Monday, a School board member told News 9 that Neu was planning on leaving. Tuesday afternoon the district filed a notice of a meeting Thursday where board members will go into executive session to discuss his employment. The agenda filed with the court clerk.

But questions about Neu's longevity with the district started surfacing way earlier, after he failed to move his family here.

“We didn’t think he was going to have staying power in this district, you know? When you don’t move your family, you leave them on the west coast, that sends a big message you aren’t committed to the community,” said Ed Allen, President of the OKC-AFT, which represents the district’s teachers.

Neu has had a tumultuous relationship with the district's teacher's union who just last week criticized, among other things, his “lavish employment contract.”

“Thirty-five days of vacation every year, that’s on top of holidays, on top of sick leave. I think that’s excessive,” said Allen.

However, News 9 obtained copies of Neu's contract and compared it side-by-side to the new Tulsa superintendent Deborah Gist and found no glaring differences.

Neu is under contract with the district until June 30, 2017.
