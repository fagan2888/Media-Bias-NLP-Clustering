Friday\u2019s show was Fallon\u2019s last until after Christmas. The Tonight Show gang is headed on a break, but he\u2019s ended with a great episode featuring Channing Tatum and star of the new Star Wars: The Force Awakens John Boyega. Here\u2019s the full recap.\n\nMonologue\n\nAs to be expected Jimmy touched on the fact that we are just a week away from Christmas. He kicked off the monologue with a joke about people running out of time to find gifts for their significant others. It\u2019s too late to get creative. A great joke about Star Wars won the joke of the monologue. Saturday is the third democratic debate. According to Jimmy, \u201cexperts say that Hillary needs to maintain the lead, Bernie Sanders needs to catch up and Martin O\u2019Malley will be there.\u201d The U.S. Department of health is extending the enrollment period for Obamacare to January first. Punchline: \u201cWhat better time to sign up for Obamacare on the day we all lie to ourselves about being healthier. Jimmy debuted a hilarious play on YouTube\u2019s Best-of-the-Year collection by featuring a collection of real anti-viral YouTube videos. The videos have 10 views or less. He then closed the monologue with a editing compilation of Star Wars characters singing \u201cStayin\u2019 Alive\u201d by the BeeGees. It\u2019s similar to the now defunct Brian Williams Raps. It wasn\u2019t quite as good as the Brian Williams Raps, but still a nice treat for Star Wars fans. Unfortunately, Fallon hasn\u2019t uploaded the clip to his YouTube channel as of yet.\n\nJoke of the Monologue: Everyone is talking about the movie that has finally been released after months of waiting. The movie finally came out and fans and critics are saying it\u2019s even better than the previous sequels. Yes that\u2019s right, Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Road Chip is finally in theaters.\n\nTo the Desk\n\nThank You Notes\n\nJimmy continues with his signature Friday bit of Thank You Notes. Check out Friday\u2019s rendition and highlights below.\n\n\u201cThank you, Three Wise Men, for bringing the worst baby gifts ever.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you, batteries, for not being lonely even though you\u2019re never included.\u201d\n\n12 Days of Christmas Sweaters\n\nIt\u2019s the final night of Jimmy\u2019s holiday tradition. In the 12 nights leading up to Christmas, Jimmy gives away an ugly Christmas sweater to a random member of the audience. The final sweater was especially horrid with a flashing fire place and stockings above it. Yikes.\n\nThe Guests\n\nChanning Tatum\n\nPopular guest of The Tonight Show Channing Tatum is out to promote Quentin Tarantino\u2019s The Hateful 8. They began the interview by talking about their children and the upcoming Christmas. Channing\u2019s daughter doesn\u2019t quite understand the concept of Santa Clause yet, especially mall Santas. He doesn\u2019t want to force her to go sit on Santa\u2019s lap, but she can if she wants to. Apparently she doesn\u2019t want to because she says he\u2019s too old. That segued into talk about his appearance in The Hateful 8. Channing really wanted the role, but he can\u2019t talk much about his role. Quentin is trying to keep his character under wraps. He was very nervous about his first table read for the movie due to the caliber of actor that is also in the film. When he shook Bruce Dern\u2019s hand for the read he almost pulled his arm out of the socket, which Bruce was not too happy about. According to Channing, Quentin Tarantino is a cut-up on the set of his movies.\n\nEgg Russian Roulette\n\nEgg Russian Roulette is a signature bit Fallon likes to play with his guests. Jimmy and his guest take turns selecting eggs from a dozen and smashing them on his own head. Eight of them are hard boiled, while four of them are raw. Channing is a great choice for this bit. Check out who won below.\n\nJohn Boyega\n\nThe final guest of the show has been making the late-night rounds for the past month. One of the breakout stars of the new Star Wars: The Force Awakens is a great personality for Fallon\u2019s type of show. Jimmy thanked John for helping out with The Tonight Show\u2019s Star Wars a cappella bit from earlier this week. They showed off some behind-the-scenes B-roll of the star helping with the bit. He had fun with the whole process. Jimmy asked him about the audition process and the secrecy. John said that he told director J.J. Abrams that he was at an art gallery when he was really at home when he called to tell him he got the part. John headed to a couple theaters on Friday night to surprise people going to see Star Wars. That would be so cool to see.\n\nJimmy closed the show by performing music form Charlie Brown\u2019s Christmas with a children\u2019s choir. It was a nice touch to send off his show into holiday break. And that\u2019s a wrap for Fallon before Christmas.
