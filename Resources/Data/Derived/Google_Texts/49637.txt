The lawsuit claiming billionaire William Koch kidnapped and imprisoned one his executives at his Western-themed ranch near Paonia will be heard in Colorado District Court after a judge rejected the executive’s request to hear the case in his home state of California.

U.S. District Judge Jacqueline Corley approved Koch’s request to move the case to Colorado after hearing former Oxbow Group executive Kirby Martenson testify that he never tried to flee, alert bystanders or use his mobile phone during the time he said he was imprisoned by Koch and driven from the ranch to a private jet in Denver. Martenson’s testimony was from a case in Florida, where Oxbow is suing the former vice-president in the company’s Asia-based petroleum coke trading business for allegedly defrauding the company.

Martenson claims he was held captive for three hours after Koch summoned him to the Western-themed, 420-acre Bear Ranch and confronted him with allegations of fraud in March 2012. Oxbow sued Martenson and other executives that same month for accepting bribes and misappropriating revenues. Martenson filed his false imprisonment lawsuit in October 2012, claiming Koch’s Oxbow was scheming to hide overseas revenues and evade U.S. taxes.

Courthouse News Service on Wednesday reported that Corley concluded it would be easier to gather evidence in Colorado, saying “Colorado is central to the majority of the events.”
