I\u2019m embarrassed for our country. I\u2019m embarrassed for New York.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI\u2019m embarrassed that you, after serving so selflessly with such heroism, have to come down here and convince people to do what\u2019s right for the illnesses and difficulties that you suffered because of your heroism and because of your selflessness.\u201d\n\nMr. Stewart and the emergency workers planned to talk to lawmakers in meetings on Wednesday. Before that, the comedian warned them about what they might face in the halls of Congress.\n\n\u201cToday on the Hill, you will be exposed to possibly toxic levels\u201d of arrogance and other unpleasant fumes, he said, using a word that became the theme of his last \u201cDaily Show\u201d monologue.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20150916165039, "twitter": {"description": "Mr. Stewart has long supported the law, which provides federal health care for rescue workers at ground zero and which will start expiring next month.", "title": "Jon Stewart Joins 9/11 Workers in Pressing Congress to Extend Benefits", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/17/nyregion/jon-stewart-joins-9-11-workers-in-pressing-congress-to-extend-benefits.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003916300"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "creator": "benjmueller", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/17/nyregion/STEWART-web/STEWART-web-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/17/nyregion/jon-stewart-joins-9-11-workers-in-pressing-congress-to-extend-benefits.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003916300", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/17/nyregion/jon-stewart-joins-9-11-workers-in-pressing-congress-to-extend-benefits.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "nyregion", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/nyregion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Sept. 16, 2015", "edt": "The New York Times on the Web", "org": "House of Representatives", "keywords": "Stewart  Jon,James Zadroga 9-11 Health and Compensation Act,September 11 (2001),Senate,House of Representatives", "news_keywords": "Senate", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Benjamin Mueller", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/17/nyregion/STEWART-web/STEWART-web-thumbLarge.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Stewart, Jon", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By BENJAMIN MUELLER", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Mr. Stewart has long supported the law, which provides federal health care for rescue workers at ground zero and which will start expiring next month.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/17/nyregion/STEWART-web/STEWART-web-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "Mr. Stewart has long supported the law, which provides federal health care for rescue workers at ground zero and which will start expiring next month.", "CG": "nyregion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Sept. 16, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/nyregion/index.html", "section": "N.Y. / Region", "modified": "2015-09-17", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/nyregion/index.jsonp", "tag": "House of Representatives", "published": "2015-09-16", "section-taxonomy-id": "C4DC8C0C-E148-4201-BF10-82F1C903DBFB"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "17stewart", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20150917091920, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/17/nyregion/jon-stewart-joins-9-11-workers-in-pressing-congress-to-extend-benefits.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/17/nyregion/STEWART-web/STEWART-web-facebookJumbo.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Mr. Stewart has long supported the law, which provides federal health care for rescue workers at ground zero and which will start expiring next month.", "title": "Jon Stewart Joins 9/11 Workers in Pressing Congress to Extend Benefits"}, "pdate": 20150916, "des": "September 11 (2001)", "articleid": 100000003916300, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Jon Stewart Joins 9/11 Workers in Pressing Congress to Extend Benefits", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe586e\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI\u2019m embarrassed.\nJon Stewart, the recently retired host of \u201cThe Daily Show,\u201d exhorted Congress on Wednesday to permanently extend a law providing treatment and compensation to rescue workers who were injured or sickened by the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.\nI\u2019m embarrassed for our country.\nI\u2019m embarrassed for New York.\nBefore that, the comedian warned them about what they might face in the halls of Congress."}
