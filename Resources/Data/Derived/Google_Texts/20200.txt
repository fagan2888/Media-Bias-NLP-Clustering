Crews battled the heat while working to extinguish a fire Sunday afternoon that destroyed a mobile home in Valley Center.

Firefighters were called around 3:30 p.m. to the fire at Meridian and Allen Street, near the Sonic Drive-In. When they arrived, they found heavy smoke and fire coming from the mobile home.

Crews managed to gain control of the fire in about 15 minutes. No one was hurt, and the Red Cross was called in to assist the family.

The cause of the fire has not been determined, but the home was deemed a total loss.

At the time of the fire, the temperature in the Wichita area was 93 degrees with a heat index of 103.

Friends of the family said a man and a woman lived at the home with their 3-year-old son and a baby girl on the way.
