Some advocates wonder whether that was enough time to find another doctor.\n\nLarry Dixon, executive director of the Alabama Board of Medical Examiners, said Alabama Psychiatric Services originally notified the board on Jan. 19 that they would be closing some offices and helping transition patients to new providers. As long as Alabama Psychiatric services provided some notice to patients and provides access to medical records, the company does not run afoul of patient abandonment laws, Dixon said.\n\n\"Abandonment would be without any notice whatsoever,\" Dixon said.\n\nAlabama Psychiatric Services said it is closing due to a dispute with Blue Cross Blue Shield. For many years, the clinics were the only provider of mental health care for patients in the insurer's Extended Psychiatric Services program. A statement from Alabama Psychiatric Services said the company could not reach an agreement with Blue Cross Blue Shield on payments, which led to the decision to close.\n\nSome of the psychiatrists and other providers will be creating new practices, but it may take time to complete the necessary paperwork to get in insurance networks. According to a statement from Blue Cross Blue Shield, providers who have been employed by Alabama Psychiatric Services are being encouraged to stick with the insurance company.\n\nThe Alabama Psychiatric Physicians Association released a statement yesterday expressing shock at the announcement. Dr. Sandra Parker, president of the association, said she is concerned that some of the providers employed by Alabama Psychiatric Services may move out of state after the closure.\n\n\"We just need to keep them in the state,\" she said. \"We don't have enough psychiatrists as it is.\"\n\nPsychiatrists have been calling the association to ask how they can help, Parker said.\n\nSchachter also said he has been talking with other psychiatrists about how they can help fill the void left by Alabama Psychiatric Services. In the end, he thinks most of the patients in the cities will find new providers. Patients in smaller communities such as Cullman and Florence that were serviced by Alabama Psychiatric Services may have a harder time, Schachter said.\n\n\"It's much tougher in smaller towns,\" Schachter said. \"Some of these patients may have to drive to Birmingham or Huntsville.\"\n\nFor patients, Schachter advised them not to wait until the last day to secure medical records or get medication refilled. Those patients without another provider should find a primary care physician who can maintain their medication. And if patients run out of medicine and start feeling bad or unstable, he suggests that they go to the closest emergency room.\n\n\"The important thing is not to let it become a crisis,\" Schachter said.\n\nUpdated 5:46 p.m. to correct date closure was announced.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "news", "title": "28,000 psych patients left without care in Alabama", "og": {"site_name": "AL.com", "description": "The closure of Alabama Psychiatric Services will stretch the state's small supply of mental health providers even thinner, experts say.", "title": "28,000 psych patients left without care in Alabama", "url": "http://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2015/02/patients_unsure_were_to_turn_a.html", "image": "http://image.al.com/home/bama-media/width620/img/news_impact/photo/aps3jpg-a9835c7051bb4e76.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The closure of Alabama Psychiatric Services will stretch the state's small supply of mental health providers even thinner, experts say.", "creator": "@AmyKingsley4", "image": "http://image.al.com/home/bama-media/width620/img/news_impact/photo/aps3jpg-a9835c7051bb4e76.jpg", "title": "28,000 psych patients left without care in Alabama", "site": "@aldotcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article_date_updated": "Friday, February 06, 2015,  9:16 PM", "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "AL.com", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/amy.kingsley.5"}, "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Friday, February 06, 2015,  4:48 PM", "article_author": "Amy Yurkanin | ayurkanin@al.com", "Description": "The closure of Alabama Psychiatric Services will stretch the state's small supply of mental health providers even thinner, experts say."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb06e\"", "article_summary": "About 28,000 patients are scrambling to find new providers after Alabama Psychiatric Services closes on Feb. 13.\n\"Alabama does not have a system of care to take over all these patients,\" Schachter said.\nAlabama Psychiatric services announced its closure to the public on Wednesday, Feb. 4, giving patients about a week and a half of notice.\nFor patients, Schachter advised them not to wait until the last day to secure medical records or get medication refilled.\nAlabama Psychiatric Services said it is closing due to a dispute with Blue Cross Blue Shield."}
