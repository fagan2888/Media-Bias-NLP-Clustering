The bill has no chance of passing in the Democratic-led Assembly, but other states have successfully banned funding to the organization.\n\n\"We have been told repeatedly that there are no threats to reproductive rights here in New York state, yet legislation and efforts to de-legitimize women\u2019s health organizations prove that our rights are very much under attack,\" Senate Democratic Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, D-Yonkers, said in a statement.\n\n\"This bill caters to the fearmongers and anti-choice extremists who refuse to acknowledge the facts about Planned Parenthood. This essential organization provides vital, life-saving screenings and support to millions of women throughout New York.\"\n\nNew York has more than 60 Planned Parenthood locations, and it has secured about $134 million in state contracts since 2009, state records show.\n\n\u201cDebate the morals surrounding Planned Parenthood all you like,\u201d Katz said in a statement to the Times-Union in Albany. \u201cIt is not debatable, however, that tax dollars are being wasted by funding Planned Parenthood which offers the same services New Yorkers can now receive from a doctor through the Affordable Care Act. My bill will defund the organization so that residents\u2019 tax dollars are utilized for more worthwhile and essential areas of need.\u201d\n\nKatz, who is not seeking re-election, was knocked by Democrats in 2014 for his stance on women's rights during his successful re-election bid in a district that stretches across northern Westchester and Putnam counties.\n\n\u201cWhat a shame that New York has now joined the dubious list of states with legislation to withhold funding for vital reproductive health services,\" Sen. Liz Krueger, D-Manhattan, said in a statement.\n\n\"But even more shameful is that Assembly Member Katz justifies his bill by resorting to the same discredited litany of lies about Planned Parenthood that have been proven time and again to be nothing but a straw man manufactured to justify attacks on women\u2019s healthcare decisions.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: http://lohud.us/1SMpC0n", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "ALBANY -- Democrats are blasting legislation sponsored by Assemblyman Steve Katz that would defund Planned Parenthood in New York.", "og": {"site_name": "lohud.com", "description": "ALBANY -- Democrats are blasting legislation sponsored by Assemblyman Steve Katz that would defund Planned Parenthood in New York.", "title": "Katz bill to defund Planned Parenthood in NY roils Democrats", "url": "http://www.lohud.com/story/news/politics/politics-on-the-hudson/2016/01/28/katz-bill-defund-planned-parenthood-ny-roils-democrats/79464038/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/lohud.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "ALBANY -- Democrats are blasting legislation sponsored by Assemblyman Steve Katz that would defund Planned Parenthood in New York.", "title": "Katz bill to defund Planned Parenthood in NY roils Democrats", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2a32cd2d332dee4b15a4932b0702ecb472569bdf/r=x643&c=640x640/http/assets.gannettdigital.com/-mm-/2fe163ece40bab9f3d40a3a8492a648335398b25/c=84-0-716-632/local/-/media/Westchester/2013/12/26/tjn1227viewdelcampo.jpg", "creator": "@lohud", "site": "@lohud", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600070416", "fb": {"app_id": 169889109713077}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "(Photo: Joe Larese/The Journal News)ALBANY -- Democrats are blasting legislation sponsored by Assemblyman Steve Katz that would defund Planned Parenthood in New York.\n\u201cDebate the morals surrounding Planned Parenthood all you like,\u201d Katz said in a statement to the Times-Union in Albany.\n\"This bill caters to the fearmongers and anti-choice extremists who refuse to acknowledge the facts about Planned Parenthood.\nKatz, R-Yorktown, introduced a bill this week that would prohibit New York from funding Planned Parenthood, which has been at the center of a national debate over abortion rights.\nNew York has more than 60 Planned Parenthood locations, and it has secured about $134 million in state contracts since 2009, state records show."}
