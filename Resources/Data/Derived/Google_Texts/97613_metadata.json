Parents must agree for a student to quit before they are 18.\n\nNow Florida is one of the states looking to join 20 other states and Washington, DC in raising the drop out age.\n\nState Senator Darren Soto says 16 is too young to leave school.\n\n\u201cI believe that we need to make them stay in school until 18 when they at least have enough maturity to make the decision if they want to continue,\u201d said Soto.\n\nMore than 74% of Florida high school students graduated in 2012. Fewer than two percent dropped out. Nearly 40,000 either took an extra year, or got a certificate.\n\n\u201cI want to make sure our youth stay in school and that we tell them it\u2019s not okay to leave at 16,\u201d said Soto.\n\nFormer School Superintendent and now state Senator Bill Montford supports the higher dropout age, with reservations.\n\n\u201cRaising the age to 18 is good but that\u2019s only one step and it wont work unless we have real special programs in place that these children need,\u201d said Montford.\n\nProgram ideas include helping students during the day and after school.\n\nSenator Montford says forcing students to stay in school two additional years won\u2019t necessarily save taxpayers any money.\n\n\u201cIf we do it, there\u2019s a cost to it and we need to fund it,\u201d said Montford.\n\nHigh school dropouts earn, on average, $15,000 less than those with a diploma. Those with a college degree earn three times more than a high school graduate.\n\nFlorida\u2019s graduation rates have increased nearly 20% over the last ten years.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "21 states require students to be 18 to drop out of school and Florida is looking at joining those states with a higher drop out rate.", "language": "english", "author": "Matt Horn", "og": {"url": "http://www.wjhg.com/home/headlines/Changing-Floridas-Dropout-Age-237548101.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/473*315/drop+out+rate.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "21 states require students to be 18 to drop out of school and Florida is looking at joining those states with a higher drop out rate.", "title": "Changing Florida\u2019s Dropout Age"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.wjhg.com", "description": "21 states require students to be 18 to drop out of school and Florida is looking at joining those states with a higher drop out rate.", "title": "Changing Florida\u2019s Dropout Age", "url": "http://www.wjhg.com/home/headlines/Changing-Floridas-Dropout-Age-237548101.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/drop+out+rate.jpg", "creator": "@WJHG_TV", "site": "@WJHG_TV", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "keywords": "Changing Florida\u2019s Dropout Age", "google-site-verification": "orfdzs_E4bRXom1qluA34zerrmjsg4QfrlLSkrR3ZAQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd132d\"", "article_summary": "9,000 Florida high school students dropped out before finishing high school last year.\nMore than 74% of Florida high school students graduated in 2012.\nThose with a college degree earn three times more than a high school graduate.\nFormer School Superintendent and now state Senator Bill Montford supports the higher dropout age, with reservations.\nHigh school dropouts earn, on average, $15,000 less than those with a diploma."}
