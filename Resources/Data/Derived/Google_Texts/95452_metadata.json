of President Obama\u2019s vacation to Martha\u2019s Vineyard, White House press Secretary Josh Earnest confirmed that the president would be spending most of his time actually vacationing instead of working.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\n\u201cI think that most of the president\u2019s time on Martha\u2019s Vineyard will be spent with his family or on the golf course or a little bit of both,\u201d Earnest said, when asked if he would spend any of his vacation making calls to Democrats to rally support for the Iran nuclear deal.\n\nEarnest suggested that President Obama deserved his long vacation, citing his \u201cdemanding schedule.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it is true that those of you who have been closely following the president would note that his schedule has been especially demanding in the last several weeks,\u201d Earnest said. \u201cI think he would also be quick to tell you that the last several weeks have been especially rewarding for him.\u201d\n\nEarnest cited Obama\u2019s \u201chistoric trip to Africa\u201d as an example of Obama\u2019s busy schedule, as well as the passage of Trade Authority Promotion, reaching the conclusion of the Iranian nuclear deal, the Supreme Court ruling upholding Obamacare, and the decision to recognize gay marriage.\n\nEarnest admitted that Obama might make a few calls surrounding the details of the Iran deal, but that most members of Congress were also on vacation.\n\nWhen asked if Schumer\u2019s decision to vote against the deal was a problem for the White House, Earnest said that it was \u201cdisappointing\u201d but not \u201csurprising.\u201d\n\nHe also left open the possibility that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Obama would cross paths while on vacation, admitting it was a \u201csmall island.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t rule out that they might cross paths,\u201d he admitted, promising curious reporters that he would let them know if it happened.", "article_metadata":
