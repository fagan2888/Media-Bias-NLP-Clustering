Tuesday the headquarters of the Colorado Springs NAACP was bombed. The new movie \u201cSelma\u201d dramatizes the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s. Police are killing unarmed black Americans. The mayor of New York City, Bill de Blasio is at war with his own police officers because he advised his mixed-race son to be wary of them. The majority whip in the House of Representatives, Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican, is under fire for speaking at a meeting of a supremacist group associated with Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke.\n\nRace never pops up on the radar as a priority in national polls. But racial attitudes add to the polarization of American politics because people use those beliefs to define themselves ideologically. If you ask people why they consider themselves conservatives, they often complain about government handouts to undeserving people. People won\u2019t admit to racism, but you don\u2019t have to probe very deeply to figure out that \"welfare cheats\" is code for blacks. And when I have discussed Obamacare with people in focus groups, a big concern has been a belief that undocumented Latino immigrants would be eligible for the benefits.\n\n\n\n[SEE: 2014: The Year in Cartoons]\n\nRacial issues deeply divide Americans. The country is split down the middle on questions dealing with the relationship between minority communities and police departments. Last month, pollsters for ABC News and the Washington Post asked people whether police departments treated minorities the same way as whites. Just more than half (53 percent) of the public is confident blacks receive the treatment as whites while just under half (46 percent) isn't.\n\nThe split along racial lines is dramatic. More than 6 in 10 (63 percent) whites think minorities are treated fairly but only a fifth (21 percent) of blacks do. When an important arm of local government engenders so little trust, conflict is inevitable.\n\n\n\n[SEE: Editorial Cartoons on Immigration]", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "title": "Attitudes Toward Police and Immigration Opposition Fueled by Race", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Polls on the police treatment of minorities and public approval of Obamacare reflect the ongoing racial split in this country.", "title": "The Police, Immigration and the Racial Divide", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/brad-bannon/2015/01/07/attitudes-toward-and-immigration-opposition-fueled-by-race", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/42/7d6e0c0abc4e40a934cf2032a2016d/media:6610c118b96f4c1ea3e4b2e07724ff65ImmigrationLawsuit.JPEG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Attitudes Toward Police and Immigration Opposition Fueled by Race", "description": "Polls on the police treatment of minorities and public approval of Obamacare reflect the ongoing racial split in this country.", "card": "summary", "site": "@USNews"}, "site": "opinion", "date_published": "Jan. 7, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Brad Bannon,racism,race,immigration,Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Polls on the police treatment of minorities and public approval of Obamacare reflect the ongoing racial split in this country."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fded44\"", "article_summary": "Last month, pollsters for ABC News and the Washington Post asked people whether police departments treated minorities the same way as whites.\nBut racial attitudes add to the polarization of American politics because people use those beliefs to define themselves ideologically.\nMore than 6 in 10 (63 percent) whites think minorities are treated fairly but only a fifth (21 percent) of blacks do.\nThe country is split down the middle on questions dealing with the relationship between minority communities and police departments.\nJust more than half (53 percent) of the public is confident blacks receive the treatment as whites while just under half (46 percent) isn't."}
