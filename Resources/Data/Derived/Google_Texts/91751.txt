Hellman & Friedman Takes Control of Securitas from Bain

The PE firm's recent deals include the planned purchase of Edelman Financial and exit of Wood Mackenzie

Private equity firm Hellman & Friedman is buying control of Securitas Direct Verisure Group, which provides home security systems and fire alarms, from Bain Capital.

Terms were not disclosed, but if the deal goes through, this would be the largest-ever deal for Hellman & Friedman, which was founded in 1984, the firm says.

Malmo, Sweden-based Securitas has more than 1.9 million customers in Europe and Latin America, and has been backed by both Bain and Hellman & Friedman since 2011. Bain is selling its entire stake in the company. The Boston firm is an alternative investment business with about $75 billion in assets under management through private equity, venture capital, public equity, credit and other products.

San Francisco-based Hellman & Friedman has raised more than $35 billion in capital since it was founded. The firm focuses on software, Internet, media, financial services, business and information services, health care, energy, industrials and retail and consumer businesses.

The firm's recent transactions include a deal for Edelman Financial Services from Lee Equity Partners, and the exit of Wood Mackenzie to Verisk Analytics Inc.

Apollo Global Management (NYSE: APO) also recently made a move in the home security space when it bought and merged Protection 1 and ASG Security.
