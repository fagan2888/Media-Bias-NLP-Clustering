“Marvel’s Agent Carter” will be returning for a second season early in the new year, and according to the first teaser, it appears that Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell) is going Hollywood.

But don’t get too excited that this sneak peek will tell you anything about what’s in store for our intrepid secret agent. It’s pretty much a clip reel of Peggy Carter looking glamorous, firing a gun – and, naturally, beating up bad guys.

This prompts the question from new cast member Reggie Austin, who plays Peggy’s potential new love interest, scientist Jason Wilkes, “Are you gonna punch all of L.A.”? To which Peggy quips:

“I could do with a hobby.”

Season 2 of “Marvel’s Agent Carter” returns with a two-hour premiere, Jan. 5 at 9 p.m. on ABC.
