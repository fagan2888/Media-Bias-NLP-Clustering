Atlantic City will drastically change the way it deals with its homeless population in less than two weeks. No longer will those seeking social services do so in a vacuum, receiving help from a single agency, such as the Atlantic City Rescue Mission or the John Brooks Recovery Center. Instead, the state, the New Jersey Casino Reinvestment Development Authority and Atlantic County have developed a "single point of entry" system that will act as a clearing house for all seeking help.
