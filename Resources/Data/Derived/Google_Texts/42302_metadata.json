CREDIT:\n\nA new study from the University of Michigan examines what the demographics of people with Medicaid coverage will look like after Obamacare\u2019s optional expansion of the program. The findings are great news for government entitlement spending and the health of poor Americans who live lifestyles that could lead to future, costly illnesses \u2014 but that may be prevented through early medical treatment.\n\nThe report was accompanied by a graphic comparing the current 50-million person Medicaid pool against the expected 55-to-60 million person pool under the health law:\n\nCREDIT: University of Michigan\n\nAs the infographic shows, the Medicaid expansion will make the program\u2019s beneficiaries younger, less obese, and less likely to be suffering from depression. It will also bring in a substantial number of previously uninsured and childless younger men \u2014 which make sense, since most states\u2019 current Medicaid eligibility rules only extend coverage to pregnant mothers, low-income parents, and the disabled. States that choose to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act will be able to provide coverage for all adults living up to about 138 percent of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL).\n\nStudy authors expect the newly-insured population\u2019s health demographics will ultimately bring down U.S. health care spending.\n\n\u201cUnder the ACA, physicians can anticipate a potentially eligible Medicaid population with equal if not better current health status and lower prevalence of obesity and depression than current Medicaid beneficiaries,\u201d wrote the researchers. \u201cFederal Medicaid expenditures for newly covered beneficiaries therefore may not be as high as anticipated in the short term.\u201d The authors also noted that doctors may be more willing to accept Medicaid patients under Obamacare knowing that the new patients won\u2019t be substantially older, sicker, and more difficult to care for.\n\nThe proportion of beneficiaries who will be smokers or heavy drinkers will increase substantially under expansion. But if doctors treating these patients provide them with preventative care services \u2014 like smoking cessation advice, which has been shown to have a statistically significant effect on convincing people to stop smoking, and recommendations for healthier alcohol intake habits \u2014 those Americans may be less likely to develop chronic illnesses like diabetes and hypertension.\n\nThe researchers were careful to note that their study is based on the assumption that all 50 states expand Medicaid. Since only 24 states and the District of Columbia have actually chosen to do so \u2014 while 21 GOP-led states have flat-out refused expansion and another four states are still debating the issue \u2014 the new Medicaid population will likely be even healthier than what the researchers predict.\n\nThat\u2019s because many of the states refusing expansion are among the poorest and most unhealthy in the country. While that may mean less federal spending on poor and sick people in the short term, it also means that sicker Americans will have to forgo crucial medical care and may end up getting even sicker, costing the government much more money once they become eligible for Medicare.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "A new report says that the public insurance program for America's poorest will get younger, more male, and less obese under Obamacare's Medicaid expansion -- and ultimately lower health costs.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "A new report says that the public insurance program for America's poorest will get younger, more male, and less obese under Obamacare's Medicaid expansion -- and ultimately lower health costs.", "title": "What Will Medicaid Look Like Under Obamacare?", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2013/09/10/2595851/medicaid-looks-like-obamacare/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/medicaid-matters-e1378828197262.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A new report says that the public insurance program for America's poorest will get younger, more male, and less obese under Obamacare's Medicaid expansion -- and ultimately lower health costs.", "creator": "@the_sy_guy", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/medicaid-matters-e1378828197262.jpg", "title": "What Will Medicaid Look Like Under Obamacare?", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/medicaid-matters-e1378828197262.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/medicaid-matters-e1378828197262.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-10T12:23:24+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc9f4\"", "article_summary": "Health What Will Medicaid Look Like Under Obamacare?\n\u201cUnder the ACA, physicians can anticipate a potentially eligible Medicaid population with equal if not better current health status and lower prevalence of obesity and depression than current Medicaid beneficiaries,\u201d wrote the researchers.\nCREDIT:A new study from the University of Michigan examines what the demographics of people with Medicaid coverage will look like after Obamacare\u2019s optional expansion of the program.\nStudy authors expect the newly-insured population\u2019s health demographics will ultimately bring down U.S. health care spending.\nIt will also bring in a substantial number of previously uninsured and childless younger men \u2014 which make sense, since most states\u2019 current Medicaid eligibility rules only extend coverage to pregnant mothers, low-income parents, and the disabled."}
