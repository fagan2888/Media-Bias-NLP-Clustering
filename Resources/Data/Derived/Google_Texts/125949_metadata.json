GlaxoSmithKline had yet to respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe Mail said Lilly is ahead of the pack in a possible buyout of Ariad, while GlaxoSmithKline and Shire are \u201cbelieved to be keeping a close eye\u201d on the deal in case Lilly walks away.\n\nThe report said Lilly is prepared to pay $20 a share, roughly three times where Aviad shares traded prior to Thursday, when rumors started to circulate. Shares were up $2.21 to $9.73 in recent action on Friday, adding to the 12% gain on Thursday.\n\nBased in Cambridge, Mass., Ariad shares plunged in October from around the $20 level after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ordered the company to stop selling its Iclusig drug for leukemia patients.\n\nEarlier this month, the FDA opened up sales of Iclusig to a narrower band of leukemia patients for which there is no treatment. That apparently has kicked off interest in a possible buyout of Ariad while shares remain at a discounted level.\n\nFollow Russ Britt on Twitter @russbrittmktw\n\nFollow Health Exchange on Twitter @MWHealthBlog\n\nMore health-care news from MarketWatch:\n\nObamacare enrollment accelerates, crosses the 3 million threshold\n\nMcKesson, Celesio shares climb on deal while Intuitive stumbles\n\nCare.com shares surge on first day of trading", "article_metadata": {"article.created": "2014-01-24T13:43:10-05:00", "application-name": "MarketWatch.com", "twitter": {"domain": "Marketwatch.com", "description": "Tiny Ariad Pharmaceuticals is capturing the interest of three giant drug makers and shares are soaring.", "title": "Ariad shares jump nearly 30% on rumors of Big Pharma takeover", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/01/24/ariad-shares-jump-nearly-30-on-rumors-of-big-pharma-takeover/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BS073_pharma_MG_20140107105149.jpg"}, "site": "MarketWatch", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.author": "Russ Britt", "article.section": "Markets", "keywords": "Ariad Pharmaceuticals Inc.,Eli Lilly & Co.,GlaxoSmithKline,mergers and acquisitions,Shire PLC", "article.headline": "Ariad shares jump nearly 30% on rumors of Big Pharma takeover", "msapplication-task": "name=SmartMoney;action-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/;icon-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/favicon.ico", "news_keywords": "Ariad Pharmaceuticals Inc.,Eli Lilly & Co.,GlaxoSmithKline,mergers and acquisitions,Shire PLC", "author": "Russ Britt", "article.page": "Health Exchange Blog", "description": "Tiny Ariad Pharmaceuticals is capturing the interest of three giant drug makers and shares are soaring.", "article.published": "2014-01-24T13:43:10-05:00", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "msapplication-tooltip": "MarketWatch", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/01/24/ariad-shares-jump-nearly-30-on-rumors-of-big-pharma-takeover/", "app_id": 283204329838}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch", "image_count": 2}, "og": {"site_name": "Marketwatch", "description": "Tiny Ariad Pharmaceuticals is capturing the interest of three giant drug makers and shares are soaring.", "title": "Ariad shares jump nearly 30% on rumors of Big Pharma takeover", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/01/24/ariad-shares-jump-nearly-30-on-rumors-of-big-pharma-takeover/", "image": {"width": 569, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BS073_pharma_MG_20140107105149.jpg", "height": 398}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Health Exchange", "article.id": "BL-MW243B-1924", "article.updated": "2014-01-24T15:01:44-05:00"}, "article_summary": "That apparently has kicked off interest in a possible buyout of Ariad while shares remain at a discounted level.\n/quotes/zigman/66975/delayed /quotes/nls/shpg SHPGOfficials from Ariad, Lilly and Shire would not comment.\nBased in Cambridge, Mass., Ariad shares plunged in October from around the $20 level after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ordered the company to stop selling its Iclusig drug for leukemia patients.\nThe report said Lilly is prepared to pay $20 a share, roughly three times where Aviad shares traded prior to Thursday, when rumors started to circulate.\nFollow Russ Britt on Twitter @russbrittmktwFollow Health Exchange on Twitter @MWHealthBlogMore health-care news from MarketWatch:Obamacare enrollment accelerates, crosses the 3 million thresholdMcKesson, Celesio shares climb on deal while Intuitive stumblesCare.com shares surge on first day of trading"}
