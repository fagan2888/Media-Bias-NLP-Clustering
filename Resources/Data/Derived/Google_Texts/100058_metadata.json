They must get a majority of the public to support their idea so that politicians jump on it and pass laws that make it a reality. Propaganda drives this process. It\u2019s the number one way to sway public opinion. People don\u2019t know much about politics, especially complex issues, so they tend to buy the hype.\n\nWe\u2019ve got tons of recent examples of this. Birthers play on our tendency to believe conspiracy theories: As recently as 2010, 25 percent of the public doubted that President Obama is a natural born citizen. Terms like \u201cdeath panels\u201d and \u201cObamacare\u201d keep support for the Affordable Care Act low: Nearly 54 percent oppose the law.\n\nPropaganda isn\u2019t a bad thing. Edward Bernays, considered the father of public relations, said it\u2019s an essential part of a democratic society; but it does keep people from accurately perceiving issues.\n\nMarijuana proponents are exceptional political marketers. Their Pot-aganda has convinced the public of the myths that marijuana hasn't killed anyone, isn\u2019t addictive and that medical marijuana is a wonder drug for treating epilepsy. They\u2019ve also labeled opponents as morally judging pot smokers, which helps their message seem more credible.\n\n[Check out editorial cartoons about legalizing pot.]\n\nFacts indicate otherwise. Marijuana is addictive; it\u2019s a gateway drug and marijuana-related fatal car accidents have tripled since 1999. Smokers inhale about 65 percent of pesticides found in marijuana buds and much of the evidence on medical marijuana and epilepsy is anecdotal.\n\nThe biggest problem with pro-marijuana rhetoric is that its proponents seem to believe that legalization will end the war on drugs \u2013 na\u00efve assertion that shows proponents fail to understand the complexities of why national drug isn\u2019t working.\n\nPresident Richard Nixon declared a war on drugs in 1971, but his policy focused on supply. He targeted major drug cartels, and invested in drug treatment programs. President Ronald Reagan, on the other hand, shifted the policy to demand. His \u201cget tough\u201d and \u201czero tolerance policy\u201d approaches locked up countless people for nonviolent drug offenses.\n\nReagan expanded funding for law enforcement, but cut it for drug treatment, prevention and education programs. Drug addicts became the enemy, and the 1980s crack epidemic made matters worse. \u201cZero tolerance\u201d grew, and that was partly driven by implicit racism. The Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 created mandatory sentencing standards that dramatically increased the African-American prison population. Penalties for crack possession far exceeded those for cocaine. Politicians associated crack with low-income blacks and coke with middle-class whites.\n\nDemand-side drug policy has remained the norm for the last 30 years and part of the reason is that it helps politicians reap electoral gains. Even today, President Barack Obama supports the drug war. Yes: he\u2019s made some pot-friendly remarks, but he likes the Edward J. Byrne Justice Assistance Grant Program. Although the Bush administration practically defunded the program, Obama allocated $2 billion back to it with the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. He wanted to convince the public that he was tough on crime. The program has a troubled history. It ties drug arrests statistics to funding: the more arrests, the more money. Most of the money goes to drug tasks forces that have a record of disproportionally arresting poor black men for possession.\n\n[Join the debate: Should marijuana be legalized?]\n\nThe first step to fix this problem is for Congress to pass S. 1410: Smarter Sentencing Act of 2014. The law would provide funding to reform sentencing rules, mitigate prison overcrowding and racial disparities and better identify dangerous drug offenders.\n\nThe bill has been stalled in committee for a year. And while it stands a decent chance of passing the Senate \u2013 some Republicans announced this week that they\u2019re coming around to favoring it \u2013 it has zero chance of passing the GOP-controlled House. Republicans also like \u201ctough on crime\u201d policies.\n\nLegalizing marijuana isn\u2019t going to fix national drug policy. Drug cartels will make money by shifting their focus to harder drugs or looking for new markets into which to smuggle pot. If we want to reform national drug policy, we\u2019re going to have to shift its focus back on supply, and push politicians to do a lot more than jump on the pro-pot bandwagon.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "title": "Legalizing Marijuana Won\u2019t End the War on Drugs", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Put the pot debate back on facts and focus the war on drugs on supply.", "title": "Legalizing Marijuana Won\u2019t End the War on Drugs", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/jamie-chandler/2014/03/14/legalizing-marijuana-wont-end-the-war-on-drugs", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/0d/ae4147fcf4cc9ad5763f0fee71deb9/2603-8", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Legalizing Marijuana Won\u2019t End the War on Drugs", "description": "Put the pot debate back on facts and focus the war on drugs on supply.", "card": "summary", "site": "@USNews"}, "site": "opinion", "date_published": "March 14, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Jamie Chandler,Skylar Young,marijuana,drugs,drug abuse,War on Drugs,Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Put the pot debate back on facts and focus the war on drugs on supply."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdda2d\"", "article_summary": "Legalizing marijuana isn\u2019t going to fix national drug policy.\nEven today, President Barack Obama supports the drug war.\nThe biggest problem with pro-marijuana rhetoric is that its proponents seem to believe that legalization will end the war on drugs \u2013 na\u00efve assertion that shows proponents fail to understand the complexities of why national drug isn\u2019t working.\nTheir Pot-aganda has convinced the public of the myths that marijuana hasn't killed anyone, isn\u2019t addictive and that medical marijuana is a wonder drug for treating epilepsy.\nSmokers inhale about 65 percent of pesticides found in marijuana buds and much of the evidence on medical marijuana and epilepsy is anecdotal."}
