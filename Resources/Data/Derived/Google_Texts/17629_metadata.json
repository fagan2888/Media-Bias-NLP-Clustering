(Charles Rex Arbogast/AP)\n\nWith Election Day drawing near, the country\u2019s most influential Democrat is finally weighing in on the midterm elections. But the big question for some worried Democrats is whether President Obama could do them more harm than good.\n\nOn Tuesday, Republicans were celebrating what they saw was a political gift from Obama in the form of sound bite perfect for an anti-Democratic attack ad. Obama told the Rev. Al Sharpton that even vulnerable Democrats trying to keep their distance from him are all \u201cfolks who vote with me. They have supported my agenda in Congress.\u201d\n\nThe remark seemed to undercut the efforts of many embattled Democrats to distance themselves from an unpopular president. It was the second time this month that Obama has put himself front and center in the midterm debate, giving Republicans a quote to tie himself to Democrats who are trying hard to keep their distance.\n\nAlready despairing about their midterm prospects, some Democrats say they are not happy with the approach Obama took with Sharpton.\n\n\u201cIf this is a strategy, it\u2019s not one that was devised with any input from Senate leadership,\u201d said one senior Democratic Senate aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk freely about his party\u2019s troubles.\n\nThe White House stressed Tuesday that Obama has been supporting Democratic candidates all along behind the scenes. He has headlined dozens of fundrasiers\u00ad and provided logistical and tactical support from his 2012 campaign. And he has been key to motivating party base voters ahead of the Nov. 4 election.\n\n\u201cDemocrats who are running in red states, blue states and in so-called purple states are going to need the strong support of those voters who supported the president in his reelection campaign,\u201d said White House press secretary Josh Earnest.\n\nBut Democrats on Capitol Hill worry privately that Obama\u2019s remarks will complicate the final leg of the campaign, which is shaping up as an uphill climb for the party. Senior Senate aides said Tuesday that Senate Democratic leaders never asked the White House for Obama\u2019s help in explaining the difficulty some Democrats have in being too closely associated with him, and they said that his remarks were not part of any coordinated effort to gin up turnout among young and minority voters, who have been less eager to vote in midterm elections.\n\nObama told Sharpton on Tuesday that he sees his job as getting out his base \u2014 in that case, African American voters.\n\n\u201cThese are folks who are strong allies and supporters of me,\u201d Obama told Sharpton of the candidates that are telling him to stay away. \u201cI tell them \u2014 I said, you do what you need to do to win. I will be responsible for making sure that our voters turn out.\u201d\n\nObama has started to do that publicly, appearing at rallies for gubernatorial candidates in two strongholds: his hometown of Chicago and in Prince George\u2019s County, Md., where 65 percent of voters are African American. He was scheduled to attend a rally last week in Bridgeport, Conn., a city that ran out of ballots in 2010, something officials blamed on enthusiasm garnered by a visit from Obama.\n\nObama\u2019s interview with Sharpton is part of a series of interviews he is conducting on African American radio shows, including with Steve Harvey and Yolanda Adams. And the president is scheduled to campaign next week with Democrats \u2014 all governors and one congressional candidate.\n\n\u201cI bet there are a whole bunch of folks listening to your show who might not even know there\u2019s a midterm election going on,\u201d Obama said on \u201cThe Rickey Smiley Morning Show.\u201d \u201cI need everybody to go vote.\u201d\n\nAs word spread of the remarks, several heated exchanges went back and forth along both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue. Senate Democrats continue to believe that the best service Obama can provide is through fundraising.\n\nNot being uniformly welcome on the campaign trail by Democrats is a marked shift for Obama, who ascended to the presidency in part because of the power of his campaigning. Now his biggest asset is being able to quietly raise enormous amounts of money. His fundraising schedule has been packed this year, and he has almost single-handedly moved the Democratic National Committee out of debt. Obama has also shared the data his campaign collected on supporters nationwide in 2012, which allows congressional and gubernatorial candidates to recruit volunteers in battleground states.\n\n\u201cThe fact of the matter is the president has spent a lot of time over the past couple of years trying to boost the candidacy of Democratic candidates, both incumbents and challengers, all across the country,\u201d Earnest said.\n\nIn his appeal to the base over the past few weeks, Obama has stressed a populist economic message, seizing on issues including the Affordable Care Act, middle-class families, raising the minimum wage and equal pay for women \u2014 issues that rile up his core supporters.\n\n\u201cI am not on the ballot this fall,\u201d Obama said. \u201cBut make no mistake: These policies are on the ballot. Every single one of them,\u201d Obama said at Northwestern University this month.\n\nBut Obama has made it clear in the past that he considers himself a part of the midterms.\n\n\u201cDespite having told Michelle that I\u2019d already run my last campaign,\u201d Obama said at a Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee fundraiser in Weston, Mass., in June, \u201cIt turns out I had to tell her I got one more left.\u201d\n\nObama has long said that Democrats have a \u201ccongenital defect\u201d: not voting in midterm elections. This cycle, he is pleading with his core supporters to vote \u2014 and to bring as many like-minded friends and family members along as possible.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to grab your co-workers. Don\u2019t just get the folks who you know are going to vote,\u201d Obama said in Chicago on Sunday. \u201cYou got to find cousin Pookie. He\u2019s sitting on the couch right now watching football \u2014 hasn\u2019t voted in the last five elections. You\u2019ve got to grab him and tell him to go vote.\u201d\n\nA senior Senate Democratic aide said that while Senate contenders agree with Obama on issues such as equal pay and student-loan debt, \u201cour candidates also disagree with the president on many issues, and they\u2019re not afraid to voice it.\u201d\n\nThe Democratic candidate for Senate in Kentucky, Alison Lundergan Grimes, has tried so hard to avoid being associated with Obama that she refused to say whether she voted for him. Sen. Mark Udall (D-Colo.) has taken pains to distance himself from Obama, shunning a Democratic fundraiser the president attended in Denver in July.\n\n\u201cLet me tell you, the White House when they look down the front lawn, the last person they want to see coming is me,\u201d Udall said in September.\n\nEarnest said Tuesday that it is up to each candidate to turn out voters.\n\n\u201cUltimately, those Democratic candidates will have to develop their own strategies in their states,\u201d Earnest said, and he is not one to \u201csecond-guess\u201d whether they should tell Obama to stay away.\n\nRegardless of what happens next month, Earnest said the White House will get some of the credit \u2014 or blame.\n\n\u201cI am confident that if Democrats are able to hold onto the majority in the United States Senate, that there will be plenty of credit to go around,\u201d Earnest said. \u201cI\u2019m also confident that if things don\u2019t turn out the way that we hope and expect, that the president will get at least his share of the blame.\u201d\n\nPaul Kane contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama has raised a lot of campaign cash for Democrats, but can he help them on the trail?", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/zezimak", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "President Obama has raised a lot of campaign cash for Democrats, but can he help them on the trail?", "title": "Some Democrats worry about whether Obama\u2019s campaigning will help or hurt", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/some-democrats-worry-about-whether-obamas-campaigning-will-help-or-hurt/2014/10/21/917dacce-5954-11e4-bd61-346aee66ba29_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/10/21/National-Politics/Images/Illinois_Governor_Obama-06bc9.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@WaPoSean"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/some-democrats-worry-about-whether-obamas-campaigning-will-help-or-hurt/2014/10/21/917dacce-5954-11e4-bd61-346aee66ba29_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "obama and democrats, helping or hurting", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/zezimak"}, "eomportal-uuid": "917dacce-5954-11e4-bd61-346aee66ba29", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "obama and democrats, helping or hurting"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdadae\"", "article_summary": "But the big question for some worried Democrats is whether President Obama could do them more harm than good.\nSenate Democrats continue to believe that the best service Obama can provide is through fundraising.\nAlready despairing about their midterm prospects, some Democrats say they are not happy with the approach Obama took with Sharpton.\nPresident Obama stands with Illinois Gov.\nThe White House stressed Tuesday that Obama has been supporting Democratic candidates all along behind the scenes."}
