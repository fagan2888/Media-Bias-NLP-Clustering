Other serious men in suits, the leaders of the city\u2019s first responders, flanked them. But the threat Mayor Bill de Blasio and Sen. Charles Schumer assembled those officials to talk about didn\u2019t come from a guerrilla or a gunman or a gang.\n\n\u201cIn the past, we\u2019ve been able to rely on the federal government to be a true partner and a strong partner,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said. \u201cBut we\u2019re troubled by what we see in this new budget proposal.\u201d\n\nPresident Barack Obama\u2019s administration had proposed to slash urban anti-terrorism funding in half, a move that unsettled Mr. de Blasio and Mr. Schumer\u2014the senator himself said he was \u201cshocked, disappointed, chagrined.\u201d But it shouldn\u2019t have surprised either of them.\n\nThe proposed terror funding cuts are just the latest slight by the federal government against New York City and urban America at large. Even as more and more Americans (62.7 percent in the last U.S. Census) call cities their home, the president, the Congress and the people who are trying to be the next president seem to be ignoring them, or worse, disparaging them\u2014and that translates into stalled policy efforts and diminished funding for cities like this one that do the heavy financial lifting for the rest of the country.\n\nAnd so, on an almost-spring day in Washington, Mr. de Blasio moved with the aggressive motorcade and long strides of a very important, very tall man on a mission.\n\nHe was in the nation\u2019s capital to plead his constituents\u2019 case: to first publicly, and then privately, press for Mr. Obama\u2019s administration to abandon the terror cuts\u2014and to ask for a little help bailing out a massive public hospital system for good measure.\n\nLike the walk along Capitol Hill, the task was something of an uphill climb. But the mayor had hope.\n\n\u201cIn the end, there is something traditional but very valuable about sitting in the room with someone who has the power to make the difference, making the case, making sure they understand the challenge and are registering the depth of it,\u201d Mr. de Blasio told the Observer. He\u2019d spent the day testifying before the House committee and holding private meetings with Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson and Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Matthews Burwell.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re the mayor you don\u2019t run from these problems,\u201d said Mick Cornett, the Republican mayor of Oklahoma City.\n\nA few weeks before Mr. de Blasio and Sen. Charles Schumer first rang alarm bells about the terror funding, they were prodding Congress for approval of a highway bill that contained more funding for mass transit\u2014a bill that took 10 years to pass. Not long before that, they were pleading with lawmakers to pass the Zadroga Act, which provides health care for September 11 first responders\u2014the same men and women Congress heralds every year in platitude-laden anniversary statements but whose health care is apparently too expensive for some people\u2019s taste. And that\u2019s to say nothing of the lack of action on more broadly urban issues: infrastructure, transportation, criminal justice reform, education funding and dealing with a broken immigration system.\n\nStepping up to fill the policy void have been cities, and their mayors.\n\n\u201cWe are triaging all the time, trying our best to keep up\u2014but it\u2019s far from what it should be for a modern economic capital,\u201d Mr. de Blasio told the Observer in an interview at his City Hall office last month. \u201cWe understand at this point in history we\u2019re left on our own a lot of the time. And it simply means we can\u2019t be what we could be\u2026We\u2019ve almost become used to the notion of the absence of the federal government on a whole host of these issues. But it doesn\u2019t have to be this way.\u201d\n\nAnd historically, it hasn\u2019t. Mr. de Blasio names Fiorello La Guardia as his favorite mayor in the city\u2019s history: \u201cThat\u2019s his desk right there,\u201d said Mr. de Blasio, proudly pointing to the spot where he sat during our interview. But it would be nearly impossible for any mayor today to achieve what La Guardia did, even though Mr. de Blasio presides over a booming city and La Guardia led a struggling one. The difference\u2014what enabled the Little Flower to build public housing and create public radio and launch public health clinics\u2014is federal help.\n\nIn 1978, just a few years after the Daily News famously summed up President Gerald Ford\u2019s response to the city\u2019s fiscal crisis as \u201cdrop dead,\u201d 22.7 percent of New York\u2019s budget came from federal aid, according to an analysis from Mr. de Blasio\u2019s office. But that figure began to fall quickly in the trickle-down 1980s, landing at 11 percent by 1988. There have been periodic spikes\u2014in the early aughts, in response to the September 11, 2001, terror attacks; in 2010, with the injection of federal stimulus dollars; in 2013, with money meant to reimburse the city for the cost of Hurricane Sandy. But overall, the trend is strikingly down: in 2015\u2014when the city budget was $75 billion\u2014the federal government only chipped in 8.9 percent. The city predicts that the figure will continue to fall in the out-years.\n\nThe city manages to work around the missing money \u201cimperfectly,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said with a resigned laugh as he waited in a basement hallway to meet with the city\u2019s congressional delegation. \u201cThat\u2019s the reality. We can in some cases find a way to be more efficient. In some cases we devote our own resources as best we can. But it\u2019s never the same as having a federal partner.\u201d\n\nThe analysis of federal aid in the city budget does not include money for independent authorities, like the ones that run the city\u2019s public housing and public hospitals\u2014which are also seeing less funding. New York City Housing Authority CEO Shola Olatoye said the city has lost more than $1 billion in federal funding since 2001.\n\n\u201cThe sad shame is that the continued federal disinvestment has meant a steady and insidious decline of this precious asset,\u201d Ms. Olatoye said at a New York Law School breakfast. \u201cThe result? Slow repairs, persistent repair challenges. The headlines. Trash. Really deplorable conditions in some of our communities.\u201d\n\nThe city has devoted some of its own resources, as Mr. de Blasio said\u2014it stopped charging NYCHA property taxes and for police protection, freeing up cash for repairs. Long-term, the administration has more controversial plans to become solvent: leasing the grassy open space outside housing projects to developers to build 17,000 new apartments.\n\nBut as Ms. Olatoye said, the consequences of disinvestment are still making headlines. Last week U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara demanded records about \u201cunsafe and unhealthy\u201d conditions in the city\u2019s public housing\u2014including records about elevated levels of lead in the blood of tenants, and whether the city may have lied in seeking federal reimbursements for repair work.\n\nIt\u2019s not just a New York City problem. On the very day Mr. de Blasio went to Washington, the nation\u2019s capital announced its Metro system was so outdated and dangerous it needed to be abruptly closed for 29 hours, a near-perfect distillation of the federal government\u2019s dismal failure to invest in urban infrastructure.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re the mayor you don\u2019t run from these problems,\u201d said Mick Cornett, the Republican mayor of Oklahoma City and the incoming president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors. \u201cThese problems are part of your everyday experience, and the people who elected you are part of your everyday conversation. When you get in Washington and looking at big-picture problems like multibillion-dollar transportation bills, it gets lost.\u201d\n\nMr. Cornett and Mr. de Blasio worked together on the massive transportation bill, which finally passed in December, as far back as last May. They held a press conference together just a few hours after yet another example of its sad state\u2014the derailment of Amtrak Train 188, en route from Washington to New York and carrying 243 people (including this reporter), in a fatal crash that killed eight.\n\n\u201cWashington is such a partisan city that if the Republican mayor can show up with the Democratic mayor, I think it helps a little bit,\u201d Mr. Cornett said.\n\nMr. de Blasio smiled at the mention of his Oklahoma City counterpart\u2019s name, saying they \u201cteamed up really well.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook, mayors made an impact on the highway bill,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said. \u201cIt took a lot of different pushes and pulls. We ultimately got to a good place\u2014not perfect.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see some coalitions starting to form that could break this logjam,\u201d he added. \u201cThat gives me a little bit of hope.\u201d\n\nAnd he\u2019ll need it. In January, the middle of the city\u2019s fiscal year, Mr. de Blasio had to hastily allocate $337 million to the city\u2019s public hospitals\u2014which are run by an independent corporation recently rebranded as NYC Health + Hospitals\u2014just to keep facilities like Bellevue open. The cause of the shortfall, according to the city, is a reduction in federal reimbursements for uninsured patients, a result of the Affordable Care Act: The legislation assumes that more people will have insurance, and they do\u2014but undocumented immigrants who aren\u2019t eligible are still heading into the city\u2019s public hospitals for care.\n\nThe terror funding cuts are a more high-profile and explicit threat to the city, though given the reluctance of Republicans to cut anti-terror money, those cuts may not actually happen. But cash-strapped public hospitals are in many ways a more pernicious problem, and one Mr. de Blasio discussed with Health Secretary Burwell last week. He even brought backup: HHC President Dr. Ram Raju and new Deputy Mayor for Health and Human Services Herminia Palacio also attended the meeting.\n\n\u201cAnd she was very receptive and fully understands how many people our public hospital system serves and how it\u2019s a priority for the federal government to work with us to try to resolve these issues,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said. Still, he tempered expectations. \u201cNothing final has been determined\u2014I want to be very clear,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have more work to do.\u201d\n\nIt all begs the question: Should cities have to work so hard to get their fair share from the federal government? In 2013, New York City residents paid $57.3 billion in federal income tax\u2014and that doesn\u2019t include all the taxes the feds took from New York City business or non-residents who work here. The city received far less back in federal funds.\n\nThe question in New York parlance: What gives?\n\n\u201cWe saw it with Zadroga,\u201d said Congressman Daniel Donovan, the only Republican who represents New York City and as such serves as an emissary for its issues to the GOP members who run the House. \u201cThere are people down here\u2014no one believed that the rescue workers or recovery workers didn\u2019t deserve health care. There were people here who believed that was a New York problem and New York should pay for it. There are people here who believe that New York should be funding a lot of what our nation\u2019s expenses are, because of the amount of money that\u2019s in New York and the tax base and Wall Street and everything else.\u201d\n\nRichard Alles, a 9/11 first responder from Queens who lobbied Congress on Zadroga, said the experience was \u201chumiliating.\u201d Mr. Alles, who is an officer in the Uniformed Fire Officers Association, had to ask fellow first responders, men and women who were dying of cancer, to go to Washington to tell their stories. They always went.\n\n\u201cThey weren\u2019t afraid of dying. They didn\u2019t regret what they had done for their country,\u201d Mr. Alles said. \u201cAll they cared about was that their family was taken care of and that they were doing the right thing for first responders in the future.\u201d\n\nThe first time Zadroga was authorized, Mr. Alles attributed some of the reluctance to questions about the science. But by last year\u2019s fight, it was clear the cancers were linked to 9/11. \u201cI have to chalk it up to it still being a New York issue,\u201d he conceded.\n\n\u201cThe one thing that is consistent in Congress is that there is never enough money,\u201d Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney said. \u201cSo a lot of our fights are really fights over money.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s perhaps the same attitude that made it easy for middle-of-the-country representatives who have their hand out for federal help after every tornado to vote against giving New York and nearby states $60 billion after Sandy. (A great deal of that money is still being used, including $5 billion to repair the L train tunnel damaged by the storm.)\n\n\u201cI found it ironic people like Lindsey Graham, who were so adamantly opposed to the Sandy support, immediately rushed to the federal government for help after the rains came down and the flood came down in his state,\u201d said James Oddo, the Republican borough president of Sandy-devastated Staten Island. \u201cThere was a lot of hypocrisy involved. And when it\u2019s your community and your constituents who are desperately hurting, you do what we tried to do\u2014and that\u2019s move heaven and earth to try to give them some relief.\u201d\n\nAsk Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney about convincing Congress to fund city priorities and she\u2019ll rattle off $6 billion worth of infrastructure projects in her Upper East Side district, talking about securing the funds almost as if it were a competitive sport.\n\nThe most visible endeavor is the Second Avenue subway, an idea that\u2019s been kicked around and under-funded since the 1920s. After $1.2 billion from the federal government and a hefty dose of cash from the state\u2014which runs the MTA, and like the city winds up carrying some of the load when the federal government doesn\u2019t\u2014the first leg of the line is expected to open later this year. Ms. Maloney is so proud of the project she held her re-election campaign kick-off beside it on Saturday.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot to be said about quality of life. Sometimes, the Lexington Avenue subway is so crowded I say, \u2018I\u2019ll walk 20 blocks.\u2019 I can\u2019t get on it,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that just starts your day off in a bad way.\u201d\n\nMs. Maloney said there is some hostility toward New York from her colleagues, some of whom are upset their states have not bounced back from the recession as fast as New York. But she reminds them New York is a \u201cdonor state,\u201d giving the federal government more than it receives back.\n\n\u201cThe one thing that is consistent in Congress is that there is never enough money,\u201d she said. \u201cSo a lot of our fights are really fights over money.\u201d\n\n\u201cNobody cries salty tears over any dollars denied to New York,\u201d David Birdsell said.\n\nThe myopia extends across party lines. President Obama may not really intend to cut homeland security funding, but that didn\u2019t stop his administration from ripping into Mr. Schumer as he led the push to restore the money. White House spokesman Josh Earnest went after him for opposing Mr. Obama\u2019s Iran deal, saying he lacked credibility on terror issues, was wrong on that deal and was \u201cwrong this time, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe [Mr. Schumer] was saying the truth that needed to be said: that no budget should be cutting back on anti-terror funds for New York City when we\u2019re the top terror target, where in fact the challenge is becoming greater than ever\u2014and we\u2019re investing a huge amount of our own money, a vast majority of which will never get reimbursed by Washington,\u201d Mr. de Blasio told the Observer, in a rare knock on the Democratic president\u2019s administration.\n\nA White House official told the Observer the administration has \u201cno higher priority than keeping the American people safe.\u201d But the official said New York has not spent the money it already has (city officials say all of it is allocated, but that it takes time to bid out and build equipment or train employees). The White House also pointed to $100 million in new grants for anti-terror\u2014but those will be awarded to cities through a competition.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re sort of [in] the worst of all possible positions,\u201d said David Birdsell, dean of Baruch College\u2019s public affairs school. \u201cWe\u2019re the wealthiest and most prominent wealth-generating location in the United States, so nobody feels any sympathy\u2014and they love to see us taken down a peg. You know, the largest population, the glossiest museums. So nobody cries salty tears over any dollars denied to New York. But it\u2019s also, it\u2019s a little popular to be able to take a punch at New York.\u201d\n\nThere was a notable thaw after 9/11, but every New Yorker has had the experience of telling someone where they\u2019re from, only to be met with disbelief: How can you live there? \u201cCan you imagine any other place\u2014can you imagine saying to somebody from Pawtucket, R.I.,\u201d Mr. Birdsell feigned disgust, \u201cPawtucket?\u201d\n\nEven presidential candidates do it, without any fear that generalizing about 8.1 million people might hurt them in the polls. U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, in search of the Republican presidential nomination, sneered about Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cNew York values.\u201d The line conjured up Sarah Palin\u2019s 2008 assertion that \u201creal America\u201d is found in small towns.\n\nDoes that rhetoric help lead to utter disregard toward urban policy in Washington? \u201cIt certainly doesn\u2019t help,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said.\n\nIndeed, beyond rhetorical bomb-throwing aimed at the city, noted Mr. Birdsell,\u201cThis campaign is alas not unique, but remarkable, in the complete absence of urban issues in any of the candidates\u2019 platforms.\u201d\n\nThere are a handful of cold political truths about why these issues get so little attention in presidential races. Democrats already know they will win cities, Republicans know they will lose them, and then there are the states that shape the early narrative of the presidential race\u2014Iowa and New Hampshire\u2014which are not exactly known for their bustling and diverse metropolises.\n\n\u201cI think this is par for the course in a presidential campaign,\u201d Bruce Katz of the Brookings Institution said in an interview. \u201cCampaigns are mostly horse-race driven. The focus is on politics and personality.\u201d\n\nThe real test, he said, comes later\u2014in the transition and the early days of an administration, when a president has a short window of time to get things done while riding on the goodwill of his or her election. It\u2019s still hard to get anything done, particularly in the Senate, where, say, Montana has as many votes as New York.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a completely different century,\u201d Mr. Katz said. \u201cThe conversation about the federal government feels at times like a 1960s conversation.\u201d\n\nMr. Obama introduced an Office of Urban Affairs in the early days of his administration, appointing as its head a New Yorker, former Bronx Borough President Adolfo Carri\u00f3n, but little came of it. Still, Mr. Katz said Mr. Obama did have an urban agenda, if in a less top-down way than in the past\u2014putting money into planning, backing good ideas that emerged from cities with \u201ccatalytic resources that spur innovation.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the message to cities is, \u2018Look, you\u2019re not going to get a lot of new initiatives.\u2019 They\u2019re not going to ride in on a horse and save the day here,\u201d Mr. Katz said. \u201cSo you\u2019ve got to basically figure out yourself: a) what are your priorities and b) how do you take the resources you\u2019re getting and leverage them up to the maximum percent?\u201d\n\nAnd in a time of \u201cfederal drift and dysfunction,\u201d as Mr. Katz put it, it\u2019s up to not just mayors but also private and civic groups, universities and hospitals, pension and sovereign funds, to \u201cget really disciplined about how they\u2019re trying to basically play the hand they\u2019re dealt.\u201d In that way, a city like New York will fare better than cities with weak economies.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a completely different century,\u201d Mr. Katz said. \u201cThe conversation about the federal government feels at times like a 1960s conversation.\u201d\n\nIronically, back then, the reason the federal government was pumping money into New York and other cities was because of their decay. In that way, the city has been a victim of its own success.\n\n\u201cThis is a very different discussion than it was, you know, in the heyday of government investment, for example Dwight Eisenhower,\u201d Mr. de Blasio concurred. \u201cA Republican president, former general, led the charge on a federal government that invested heavily. You know, we got the interstate highway system because of Dwight Eisenhower. He very much believed in a muscular role for government investing to build our economy. But that was at a point when cities were, as you note, cities were actually in decline in many ways, in the \u201950s going into the \u201960s.\u201d\n\nNow, Mr. de Blasio said, we\u2019re in a clear trend of cities growing and leading the economy. And that, he said, is not a reason to back away: it\u2019s a reason to invest once again.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d think the Republicans in Washington would be clamoring for more support for the cities and more opportunities to invest because it will spur on the private sector economy,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a real contradiction, those who profess a belief in the free enterprise system but aren\u2019t willing to make the government investments that would actually help to build jobs where they will and can be built\u2014which is our cities.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.byline_name": "Jillian Jorgensen", "sailthru.author": "Jillian Jorgensen", "application-name": "Observer", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/de_blasio_dc_2016_0115.jpg?quality=80&w=640"}, "site": "@observer", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@Observer"}, "sailthru.article.image.header": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/de_blasio_dc_2016_0115.jpg?quality=80&w=728&h=418&crop=1", "sailthru.tags": "2016, Barack Obama, Bill De Blasio, bruce katz, Carolyn Maloney, Daniel Donovan, David Birdsell, Health and Hospitals Corporation, herminia palacio, hhc, Jeh Johnson, mick cornett, New York City, NYCHA, Oklahoma City, Ram Raju, second avenue subway, sylvia matthews burwell, terror funding cuts, terrorism funding, uasi, obsNews & Politics, obsPolitics", "sailthru.section": "News & Politics", "keywords": "bill de blasio, barack obama, terrorism funding, terror funding cuts, uasi, nycha, health and hospitals corporation, hhc, jeh johnson, sylvia matthews burwell, ram raju, herminia palacio, mick cornett, oklahoma city, new york city, carolyn maloney, second avenue subway, 2016, david birdsell, bruce katz, brookings institute, bill de blasio interview, daniel donovan, dan donovan,", "sailthru.article.image.grid": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/de_blasio_dc_2016_0115.jpg?quality=80&w=300&h=225&crop=1", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://observer.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/dac0f3722a48a53be75eb06c0c4f5119?s=16", "news_keywords": "bill de blasio, barack obama, terrorism funding, terror funding cuts, UASI, nycha, health and hospitals corporation, hhc, jeh johnson, sylvia matthews burwell, ram raju, herminia palacio, mick cornett, oklahoma city, new york city, carolyn maloney, second avenue subway, 2016, david birdsell, bruce katz, brookings institute, bill de blasio interview, daniel donovan, dan donovan,", "generator": "WordPress.com", "msapplication-TileColor": "#2b5797", "sailthru.title": "Feds to City: Drop Dead (Again)", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "sailthru.byline_slug": "jill-jorgensen", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/de_blasio_dc_2016_0115.jpg?quality=80&w=50", "description": "The nation's mayors are banding together to demand funding for antiterrorism and infrastructure efforts.
