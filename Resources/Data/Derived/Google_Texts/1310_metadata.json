It's been reviewed in various places, including the Wall Street Journal. I just came across the recent review of it over at the Sierra Club. Like most environmental activist groups, the Sierra Club has a rather downbeat view of the future of our planet. So I was surprised at the rather wistful and somewhat contradictory tone of the review of my book over at the organization's website. From the review:\n\nIt is refreshing to read about positive trends that bode well for the future of humanity, such as the mass migration to cities (\u201cthe most environmentally benign human settlement\u201d), or the potential for self-driving cars to significantly reduce the amount of vehicles globally. Nevertheless, we get the sense that Bailey is ignoring a whole lot of bad in order to highlight the good. The book is overly packed with studies and statistics. Bailey\u2019s research was clearly exhaustive, but his writing sometimes feels like a composite of other people\u2019s arguments.\n\nOverly packed, yet clearly exhaustive? Those are criticisms? Also as a reporter, I don't just make stuff up. So I do confess to writing analyses that incorporate insights from other people's arguments, especially those derived from researchers who publish \"peer-reviewed science done in good faith.\"\n\nThe review concludes:\n\nBailey doesn\u2019t go so far as to say that rising temperatures aren't a worry, but his message is that \u201cthe solution to future climate change is the same as for other environmental problems\u2014the application of human ingenuity and technology\u201d fostered by free market capitalism. While the book doesn\u2019t entirely convince us of that, we can only hope, to some degree, he is right.\n\nMay I suggest that you all buy and read the book to see if you think that I am right?", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "The End of Doom reviewed by Sierra Club", "title": "Sierra Club Reviews The End of Doom", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2015/10/21/sierra-club-reviews-the-end-of-doom", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14454378373767.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14454378373767.jpg", "description": "The End of Doom reviewed by Sierra Club", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Sierra Club Reviews <em>The End of Doom</em>"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "Techno Optimism", "published_time": "2015-10-21T15:03:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/ronald-bailey"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7cbb\"", "article_summary": "Like most environmental activist groups, the Sierra Club has a rather downbeat view of the future of our planet.\nAs some Reason readers may have heard, I have a new book out, The End of Doom: Environmental Renewal in the Twenty-first Century.\nI just came across the recent review of it over at the Sierra Club.\nMay I suggest that you all buy and read the book to see if you think that I am right?\nWhile the book doesn\u2019t entirely convince us of that, we can only hope, to some degree, he is right."}
