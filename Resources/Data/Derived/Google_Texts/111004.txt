Kathleen Sebelius, secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is scheduled to be the keynote speaker at this year's Conference on World Affairs on the University of Colorado's Boulder campus next month.

Sebelius, who took office in April 2009, has been widely criticized for the botched rollout of the Affordable Care Act's federal health insurance website, HealthCare.gov.

The keynote speech will be held in Macky Auditorium at 11:30 a.m. April 7, the first day of the weekl-ong conference.

The title of Sebelius' speech is "The Globalization of Health," according to the conference's website. Chancellor Phil DiStefano will introduce Sebelius.

Sebelius' keynote is timely, as the final deadline to enroll for health insurance under President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act without paying a penalty is Monday.

U.S. officials estimate that more than 5 million people have enrolled in health insurance since open enrollment began last October.

Conference officials said Monday that they could not discuss Sebelius's appearance in Boulder at this time.

The CWA, which runs for a week every April, brings roughly 100 participants from a wide range of backgrounds to CU for discussion and debate during hundreds of talks and events.
