Sioux Falls, SD

A kitten suffering from extreme frostbite is doing well with a new foster family. But three weeks after our first story aired about the stray left outside during extreme cold, its fate remains uncertain.

Found as a stray in December, the three-month-old cat had severe frostbite on three paws, tail and ear.

Sioux Falls Area Humane Society's Monique Mixell believes it happened when the kitten was left outside during sub-zero temperatures.

Mixell was fostering the kitten she named Angel until a retired Sioux Falls couple saw our story. Cindy and Gary Bormann have had her ever since, when the feline lost its tail and front paw.

"It just came off," Cindy said. "It looks like maybe you can see a bone. But it is callusing over. She uses it. She forgets itâ€™s gone and will reach for something and realize she has no claws on that paw."

But Angel still faces the very real danger of losing her life. Experts say if the other two paws fall off, it would be nearly impossible for it to get around, forcing the humane society to put her down.

"The prognosis is wait and see," Mixell said. "We are just really waiting to see what the results are going to be once her other feet fall off. But looking at this one, I think she'll be okay."

"She's very healthy as far as that goes," Cindy said. "If only those paws would straighten out."

Right now, vets are unsure of what steps to take with the kitten.

The Humane Society Administration says they are keeping the animal comfortable on pain medicine and taking a wait-and-see approach.
