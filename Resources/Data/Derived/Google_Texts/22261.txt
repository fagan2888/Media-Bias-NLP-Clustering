Rescuers reached a 21-year-old climber who was stuck overnight on a mountainside in Rocky Mountain National Park, a park spokeswoman said.

The man, whose name was not released, activated a personal locator beacon Saturday night.

He was injured in a tumble down the mountainside and landed in a steep “scree area” full of loose rocks, according to a news release.

“Our rescuers reached him around 12:15 p.m.,” Kyle Patterson, a RMNP spokeswoman, told The Denver Post.

Later in the afternoon, the team was finishing rigging to extract and lower the climber. He then would walk out or be carried out, Patterson said, depending on his condition.

On Saturday, after he fell, the man “found himself in a spot where he could not move up or down,” Patterson

said.

To find him, the rangers used the beacon and GPS during a call the man made to 911 with his cellphone.

Officials said the man was about 500 feet below Thatchtop Mountain and 1,500 feet above Sky Pond.

A search-and-rescue team set out on foot early Sunday morning from the Glacier Gorge Trailhead.

A team member was also dropped at the top of Thatchtop Mountain, which has a peak elevation of 12,668 feet.

Rocky Mountain Rescue and Larimer County Search and Rescue assisted.

The rescue is the second since May inside Rocky Mountain National Park.

In late May, Samuel Frappier, 19, of Quebec, got stuck on a high, dangerous rock ledge on Longs Peak after getting separated from a friend while hiking and climbing. He was stranded for more than a day, at 13,000 feet, before rescuers reached him. He called for help on a cellphone.
