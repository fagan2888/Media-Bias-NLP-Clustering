Rather than denounce Abbott for cozying up to Nugent, CNN host Newt Gingrich attacked Blitzer for what he called \u201cremarkably selective outrage,\u201d accusing Blitzer of ignoring inflammatory remarks from Democrats, including one particular 2012 remark from Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nNugent, who is now campaigning with Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott (R-TX), launched his latest verbal volley at President Obama a few weeks ago, calling him a \u201csubhuman mongrel,\u201d among other things. In a Tuesday report on CNN\u2019s Wolf, Wolf Blitzer gave a chapter-and-verse account of that phrase\u2019s Nazi origins. On Tuesday\u2019s The Situation Room, Blitzer asked Newt Gingrich about Abbott\u2019s decision to continue campaigning with Nugent, and Gingrich conceded that what Nugent said was wrong, but then accused Blitzer of \u201cremarkably selective outrage.\u201d\n\nGingrich spanned the decades to select two examples of Democrats saying something mildly offensive, and wondered \u201cwhy isn\u2019t there some accountability\u201d for these infractions. One of those examples was Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s 2012 remark, to a mixed-race audience, that then-Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and the Republicans would \u201cput y\u2019all back in chains.\u201d\n\nSet aside Gingrich\u2019s judgment that Biden\u2019s remark is \u201cmuch more vicious\u201d than calling the President of the United States the same thing Nazi propagandists called the Jews, which Blitzer rightly called out again. Wolf didn\u2019t have instant access to footage of CNN\u2019s coverage of Biden\u2019s remark, so Gingrich\u2019s charge of \u201cremarkably selective outrage\u201d went untested. Here\u2019s a little taste of Wolf Blitzer and company completely ignoring Biden\u2019s remark:\n\nPlease enable Javascript to watch.\n\nIn fact, CNN ran at least 36 segments in 6 days on the Biden remarks. In fact, one obvious beneficiary of CNN\u2019s selectivity, such as it is, is one Newton Leroy Gingrich, who, also in 2012, told a New Hampshire crowd that his message to the \u201cAfrican-American community\u201d was to \u201cdemand pay checks and not be satisfied with food stamps.\u201d\n\nIn the week following that nakedly racist remark, CNN only aired 9 segments related to it, and then they gave Gingrich a job.", "article_metadata": {"description": "On Tuesday, CNN's Wolf Blitzer gave viewers a detailed accounting of the Nazi origins behind comments that Ted Nugent made about President Obama, and", "generator": "WordPress 2016.21", "og": {"image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/wolf2.jpg", "title": "Here\u2019s Video of \u2018Selective Outrage\u2019 by Wolf Blitzer and CNN"}, "twitter": {"description": "On Tuesday, CNN's Wolf Blitzer gave viewers a detailed accounting of the Nazi origins behind comments that Ted Nugent made about President Obama, and effectively hung those comments around the neck of GOP gubernatorial candidate Greg Abbott of Texas.
