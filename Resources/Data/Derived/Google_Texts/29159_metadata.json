Rita Potts Parks, chairwoman of the Business and Financial Institutions Committee, tout it as a way to ensure short-term loans are available after the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau enacts sweeping new reforms, perhaps as early as this spring.\n\nWhitney Barkley of the Center for Responsible Lending said her review of Parks\u2019 bill shows it to be another way to trap Mississippians in a cycle of debt. Similar bills are going through State Houses across the country, she said.\n\n\u201cThis is the national payday loan industry trying to create this installment loan product with payday loan prices,\u201d said Barkley, a policy counsel with the center and former staff attorney with the Mississippi Center for Justice.\n\n\u201cMore people will get caught in a debt trap,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are trying to shop this as a safe product.\u201d\n\nEd Sivak, vice president of policy for Hope Enterprise, parent of Hope Federal Credit Union, said the prices allowed on the proposed installment loans are far too high. Structuring of the loans could be improved as well, said Sivak, whose Jackson-based organization strives to bring financial services to unbanked communities in Mississippi, Arkansas, Louisiana and Tennessee.\n\nOne element of Parks\u2019 bill is intended to make lending more convenient by allowing check cashing and payday lenders to offer car title-pledge loans in the same locations. Today, the operations must be separated by at least a wall.\n\nIt also allows installment loans secured by car titles to extend from two months to 10 months with interest of 25 percent assessed monthly. Loans could range from $500 to $2,500.\n\nThe annual percentage rate would be 300 percent, a figure approximately half of the APR typically charged by Mississippi\u2019s more than 1,000 payday lending stores. Borrowers would have to pay down at least 10 percent of the loan each month after making the first monthly payment, according to the Financial Service Centers of Mississippi, a trade group for check cashing stores and title-pledge lenders.\n\nEven though fees would be below those charged by payday lenders, the borrower would be borrowing larger sums and embarking on a longer repayment period, said Barkley of the Center for Responsible Lending. Someone who borrowed $5,000 for 12 months would pay $4,870 in fees to the lender, she said.\n\nAt 300 percent APR, \u201cI\u2019m not sure it makes that big a difference,\u201d Barkley said of offering borrowing costs lower than payday lenders.\n\nThe new rules from the CFPB will outlaw vehicle titles as security on installment loans. With SB2406, lenders could continue making the loans but would be unable to secure them with car titles.\n\nCar titles are the best security for the lender in an industry with significantly high default rates, said Paul Goldman, head of the Financial Service Centers of Mississippi.\n\nGoldman said the approximately 150 lenders who make up the Financial Service Centers of Mississippi are willing to take the risks on the installment loans even without vehicle as collateral. Without Parks\u2019 bill, borrowers could end up with nowhere to go for short term, low-dollar loans, he said.\n\n\u201cWhen payday loans and title loans go away, there is nothing else out there\u201d for Mississippians in need of a short-term loan, Goldman said. \u201cThis will allow them to come in without a credit check and get a few hundred dollars.\u201d\n\nGoldman said title-pledge shops take on even further risks because unlike payday lenders, they can\u2019t access a borrower\u2019s bank account through payments from a post-dated check.\n\nWhile supporters of Parks\u2019 bill claim the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is intent on putting payday lenders out of business, such an outcome is far from certain. The Bureau\u2019s main goal through its reforms is to limit the frequency of payday loans to chronic borrowers and to ensure borrowers can repay the loans, the CFPB says, and notes it has no control over fees and interest rates.\n\n\u201cThe ability-to-repay concept has been employed by Congress and federal regulators in other markets to protect consumers from unaffordable loans,\u201d a Bureau spokesman said in an email.\n\nAddressing the frequency of payday loans, the CFPB said an analysis in 2014 showed that four out of five such loans are renewed or rolled over within 14 days. Most borrowers end up paying more in fees than the loan amount, the CFPB said.\n\nIn Mississippi, payday lending generated $261 million in 2013, according to an analysis by the Center for Responsible Lending.\n\n\u201cSeventy-five percent of their fees come from borrowers who have 10 or more payday loans out in a year,\u201d the Center\u2019s Barkley said.\n\nSen. Parks said in a published interview the very size of Mississippi\u2019s payday lending and title-loan industry make it important to save. \u201cThe payday loan and title loan business in our state is a billion dollar industry,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to keep the market open because so many Mississippians need these loan options, and so many rely on payday loans and titles loan when emergencies happen.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal", "description": "By Ted Carter Mississippi Business Journal JACKSON \u2013 The Mississippi Senate approved installment-loan legislation Wednesday that supporters say creates options for cash-strapped borrowers but has opponents worrying it expands predatory lending.
