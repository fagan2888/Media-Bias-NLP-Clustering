The S&P 500 fell 2 points, or 0.13% to 2080, while the Nasdaq Composite declined 2 points, or 0.03% to 5073.\n\nThe energy and health care sectors were the only decliners of 10 S&P 500 sectors.\n\nToday\u2019s Markets\n\nWall Street\u2019s gains were limited on Thursday after a big, triple-digit rally in the prior session thanks to hawkish FOMC meeting minutes.\n\nUnitedHealth Group (UNH) was the biggest weight on the Dow, shaving more than 32 points off the broad index after the company slashed its profit outlook and said it was weighing whether to exit the Obamacare health-insurance exchange. Individual plans created under the Affordable Care Act have seen lower membership growth and more customer claims than had been expected since the inception. Shares of the world\u2019s biggest health insurer saw steep declines.\n\nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe health-care sector dropped on the heels of the news as big names in the space, including Humana (HUM), Cigna (CI), Anthem (ANTM), and Aetna (AET) also saw declines in sympathy.\n\nElsewhere in corporate news, mobile payments company Square (SQ) opened 30% higher in its debut on the New York Stock Exchange. The company traded above its $9 IPO price, which was 25% below the expected range of $11 to $13 a share. The price made the company\u2019s market capitalization at $2.9 billion, far less than the $6 billion it earned in the private market.\n\nIt's worth noting that share performance among tech-related companies that have recently gone public is mixed. Box (BOX), Lending Club (LC), and Etsy (ETSY) are all trading below their IPO prices.\n\nOnline dating firm Match (MTCH), which also priced at the low end of its expected range of $12 - $14, began trading at $13.50 a share. The company saw gains as it made its public-trading debut on the New York Stock Exchange shortly after Square shares began exchanging hands.\n\nBest Buy (BBY), meanwhile, took the wraps off its latest quarterly results. The electronics retailer recorded a 2.3% decline in revenue thanks to slow sales of tablets and cell phones. Shares of the company dropped 8%.\n\nMatt Kaufler, portfolio manager at Federated Investors, said he sees one of the major themes of the market continuing to be a difficult retail environment. He pointed to Best Buy\u2019s earnings Thursday as just the latest example on top of the disappointing quarterly figures from department stores last week.\n\n\u201cThe department-store industry is just getting whacked pretty hard,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that\u2019ll continue through the holiday \u2013 which is bad for retailers, but great for consumers because prices will be attractive.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, focus remained on minutes from the Federal Reserve\u2019s October meeting, which showed central bankers were more prepared to hike short-term interest rates at its December meeting.\n\nJoshua Mahony, IG market analyst, said the minutes provided a hawkish view, but markets trended counter to policy implications as global stocks rose, while the dollar fell.\n\nIn recent action, the euro gained 0.88% against the U.S. dollar, while the greenback fell against a basket of global currencies. Meanwhile, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond declined 0.028 percentage point to 2.241%.\n\n\u201cThe meeting took place prior to this month\u2019s bumper jobs report, which highlights that, barring an absolute shocker in December, Janet Yellen and Co. can achieve the 2015 hike they seek,\u201d he said in a note.\n\nCentral bankers at the Fed reiterated at the last meeting that they will continue to closely monitor any and all economic data in the U.S. before they make a final decision to hike rates. The Labor Department said the number of Americans filing for first-time unemployment benefits fell last week to 271,000, as expected, from an unrevised 276,000 the week prior.\n\nMeanwhile, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve said mid-Atlantic manufacturing activity was back in expansion territory. The activity factory gauge rose to 1.9 in November from -4.5 in October, coming in well above expectations for a rise to -1.\n\n\u201cEconomic data continues to flow through in a confirming way and be supportive of the market,\u201d Kaufler said. \u201cInitial claims were in line with expectations and it\u2019ll continue to fuel the expectation the Fed will gradually raise rates in December, and all of that will keep the positive underpinnings in the market.\u201d\n\nElsewhere in the market, global oil prices dropped as worries about a global supply glut waned, and after comments from Wednesday from Dallas Fed President Rob Kaplan said global oil supply and demand might not find an equilibrium until the early part of 2017. U.S. crude prices fell 0.83% to $40.41 a barrel, while Brent, the international benchmark, rose 0.39% to $44.31 a barrel.\n\nMetals were up as gold headed 1.32% higher to $1,082 a troy ounce. Silver gained 1.70% to $14.36 an ounce, while copper added 0.29% to $2.09 a pound", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.modified": "2015-11-19 07:04:13 EST", "dcterms.abstract": "Wall Street was flat on Thursday as shares of the nation's biggest health insurer weighed on the Dow, and energy prices helped limit gains.", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/2015/11/19/futures-rise-add-to-prior-session-fed-fueled-gains.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-business/markets/2015/11/19/futures-rise-add-to-prior-session-fed-fueled-gains/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1447943731925.jpg?ve=1", "description": "Wall Street was flat on Thursday as shares of the nation's biggest health insurer weighed on the Dow, and energy prices helped limit gains.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "UnitedHealth Limits Dow Gains, Equities End Flat"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox Business", "parsely-metadata": "{\"author\":\"Victoria Craig\",\"subSection\":\"markets\",\"title\":\"UnitedHealth Limits Dow Gains, Equities End Flat\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-business/markets/2015/11/19/futures-rise-add-to-prior-session-fed-fueled-gains/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1447943731925.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-11-19T21:00:17Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/2015/11/19/futures-rise-add-to-prior-session-fed-fueled-gains.html\",\"type\":\"article\",\"identifier\":\"94c723d2-45ad-4ade-96e4-7d9a8020344f\",\"section\":\"markets\"}", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "prism.channel": "fbn", "dc.description": "Wall Street was flat on Thursday as shares of the nation's biggest health insurer weighed on the Dow, and energy prices helped limit gains.", "dc.identifier": "94c723d2-45ad-4ade-96e4-7d9a8020344f", "dc.language": "en-US", "pagetype": "article", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/mediumtile.png", "description": "Wall Street was flat on Thursday as shares of the nation's biggest health insurer weighed on the Dow, and energy prices helped limit gains.", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/widetile.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/smalltile.png", "prism.section": "markets", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/largetile.png", "fb": {"app_id": 116027085089150}, "dc.source": "FOXBusiness", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "dc.title": "Unitedhealth Limits Dow Gains, Equities End Flat", "dcterms.created": "2015-11-19 07:04:13 EST", "og": {"site_name": "Fox Business", "description": "Wall Street was flat on Thursday as shares of the nation's biggest health insurer weighed on the Dow, and energy prices helped limit gains.", "title": "UnitedHealth Limits Dow Gains, Equities End Flat | Fox Business", "url": "http://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/2015/11/19/futures-rise-add-to-prior-session-fed-fueled-gains.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-business/markets/2015/11/19/futures-rise-add-to-prior-session-fed-fueled-gains/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1447943731925.jpg?ve=1", "type": "article"}, "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.date": "2015-11-19", "parsely-page": "{\"author\":\"Victoria Craig\",\"subSection\":\"markets\",\"title\":\"UnitedHealth Limits Dow Gains, Equities End Flat\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-business/markets/2015/11/19/futures-rise-add-to-prior-session-fed-fueled-gains/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1447943731925.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-11-19T21:00:17Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/2015/11/19/futures-rise-add-to-prior-session-fed-fueled-gains.html\",\"post_id\":\"94c723d2-45ad-4ade-96e4-7d9a8020344f\",\"type\":\"article\",\"section\":\"markets\"}", "dc.creator": "Victoria Craig"}, "article_summary": "U.S. crude prices fell 0.83% to $40.41 a barrel, while Brent, the international benchmark, rose 0.39% to $44.31 a barrel.\nThe S&P 500 fell 2 points, or 0.13% to 2080, while the Nasdaq Composite declined 2 points, or 0.03% to 5073.\nToday\u2019s MarketsWall Street\u2019s gains were limited on Thursday after a big, triple-digit rally in the prior session thanks to hawkish FOMC meeting minutes.\nThe company saw gains as it made its public-trading debut on the New York Stock Exchange shortly after Square shares began exchanging hands.\nThe company traded above its $9 IPO price, which was 25% below the expected range of $11 to $13 a share."}
