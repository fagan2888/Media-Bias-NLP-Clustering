But a ring is the thing.\n\nOn a warm-and-fuzzy Colorado autumn evening more perfect than the Broncos\u2019 5-1 record, Manning surpassed Brett Favre as the man who has thrown the most TD passes in NFL history, and did it in 56 fewer games than it required Favre to establish the mark.\n\nIn the manner sports so perfectly takes a snapshot of time and place in America, Manning\u2019s moment to remember was recorded for posterity in a way that shouted 2014, as the stadium lit up with untold thousands of electronic fireflies, with nearly every fan in attendance holding a smart phone to record the feat.\n\nOn its way to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio, the football that Manning dropped in the hands of Demaryius Thomas to break the record was used as a prank on the Broncos\u2019 quarterback, known to teammates as the ultimate prankster.\n\nAfter Thomas scored on an 8-yard strike inside the right pylon with 3 minutes, 9 seconds remaining before halftime to give Denver a commanding 21-3 lead, the Broncos played a game of keep-away as the 38-year-old star trotted to collect the record-setting ball.\n\nINTERACTIVE: Breaking down all of Peyton Manning\u2019s career TD passes\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve lost my vertical leap,\u201d Manning quipped. His childhood decision to play quarterback instead of receiver? It was a wise choice. Manning is obviously much better at throwing a football than catching it.\n\nAs Manning lunged, D.T. tossed the ball to Emmanuel Sanders, who toyed with the veteran QB before flipping it to Wes Welker, who ran read-option before pitching it back to Sanders, who completed the double-cross double-play with a perfect strike to tight end Julius Thomas on the sideline.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the really funny part: It was no prank. Manning \u201cactually planned it,\u201d confessed Demaryius Thomas. Now that is quintessential Manning. Football\u2019s ultimate puppet master staged and practiced the speciously spontaneous scene that celebrated the historic touchdown, as fans holding giant cardboard numbers 5, 0 and 9 danced in the stands.\n\nBut we all know the truth: The rap against Manning is that he\u2019s Mr. October.\n\n\u201cCongratulations, Peyton, on your touchdown record, a great achievement,\u201d New England quarterback Tom Brady said in a congratulatory message, before adding this little zinger from the team that has proved to be Manning\u2019s toughest rival: \u201cWe\u2019ll see you in a few weeks.\u201d\n\nNobody does it better in the regular season than Manning. By the time he is done, the NFL record book will be the Book of Manning. Once he proved that the scar on the back of his neck or the nerve damage in his throwing arm could not chase him from the game, No. 509 was inevitable for Manning after moving from Indianapolis to Denver.\n\nWhat Manning needs, however, to elevate him above John Elway and Joe Montana to become the greatest QB of all time can\u2019t be found in the record book. It must be earned on the field, in the Arizona desert, on the first day of February.\n\nThe record is in Manning\u2019s pocket. But the real quest has only just begun.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really not about the record,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cIt\u2019s about the journey and what we are trying to achieve at the end of it.\u201d\n\nRecords are meant to be broken. Championships live forever.\n\nMark Kiszla: mkiszla@denverpost.com or twitter.com/markkiszla", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Kiszla: Peyton Manning\u2019s record is great, but another ring is better", "title": "Kiszla: Peyton Manning\u2019s record is great, but another ring is better", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/10/19/kiszla-peyton-mannings-record-is-great-but-another-ring-is-better/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141019__fbn-manningp1.jpg", "height": 455}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141019__fbn-manningp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-19T22:54:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T14:38:37+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdef3b\"", "article_summary": "By the time he is done, the NFL record book will be the Book of Manning.\n509 etched in the NFL record book, quarterback Peyton Manning and the Broncos can now begin the quest for the only number that really matters: Super Bowl XLIX.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really not about the record,\u201d Sanders said.\nWhat Manning needs, however, to elevate him above John Elway and Joe Montana to become the greatest QB of all time can\u2019t be found in the record book.\nINTERACTIVE: Breaking down all of Peyton Manning\u2019s career TD passes\u201cI\u2019ve lost my vertical leap,\u201d Manning quipped."}
