The consultancy still has a very large presence in Chicago, with 5,700 local full-time employees in the Chicago area as of September 2013; its global headquarters are in Dublin.\n\nOn his show, Jimmy Kimmel introduced the fake commercial by saying, \"The Obama administration is hard at work trying to reverse course on the troubled website HealthCare.gov. They've officially cut ties with the company that built the site \u2014 CGI Federal is the name of the company \u2014 and they signed a contract with the new one . . . All health care will be sold through iTunes now.\" (Cue audience laughter.)\n\nMr. Kimmel continues, \"The truth is, they signed a contract yesterday with a company called Accenture. This is one of those companies I see advertising for mostly at airports, but I don't know exactly what they do. But if their TV commercial is any indication, I think they might be the right company to get this job. They have a reputation for exactly this kind of work \u2014 and I mean exactly.\"\n\nAccenture declined to comment.
