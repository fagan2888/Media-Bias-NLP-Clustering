Goldstein picked up the coding he uses for 3-D printing online, and brims with ideas for how hospitals can capitalize on the promise of the technology.\n\n\u201cA little engineering can go a long way,\u201d said Goldstein, who prints trachea made of living cells using a modified Replicator 2, a desktop 3-D printer made by Brooklyn-based MakerBot.\n\nMost of what Goldstein and Grande are doing is not completely novel, but they hope to turn their 3-D printing skills into a business. The two are currently in talks with North Shore Ventures, the venture-capital arm of the health system formerly known as North Shore-LIJ, about creating a 3-D printing center to distribute their custom devices to physicians in the Northwell network and beyond.\n\nThe pair will start small, selling the custom drill guides they\u2019ve already started creating for dentists. Each one costs about $2 to print, plus labor.\n\nIt will be several years at least before 3-D-\u00adprinted organs make their way into human bodies. But with the ability to rapidly prototype and test new designs, progress could come fast. Rabbits have already received successful transplants with the tiny trachea Goldstein and Grande produced on one of the machines MakerBot donated to their lab.\n\nMany consider MakerBot\u2019s printers, which cost less than $2,000, well below standard for medical purposes. But, Goldstein said, he has no idea why anyone would shell out 100 times as much for printers marketed to the medical field.\n\nTo print the trachea, Goldstein fit a cubical desktop printer made by MakerBot with a syringe that spews bio-ink, a viscous material made of living cells. The nozzle that comes stand\u00adard on the machine emits an organic plastic called PLA, which creates the scaffold of the trachea. It\u2019s just a few dollars\u2019 worth of plastic, said Goldstein, holding the scaffold between his pointer finger and thumb, and it can biodegrade in the human body, so just the organ is left. The same plastic can be used to manufacture cutting guides like the ones doctors employed to reconstruct Zeesy Stern\u2019s jaw. (Read her story here)\n\nThe Feinstein Institute\u2019s trachea experiments were sparked by an inquiry from a pediatric surgeon in the health system who has patients suffering from stenosis, a potentially fatal narrowing of the airway.\n\nReplacing body parts\n\n\u201cBefore 3-D printing, there was no way we could make a trachea ideally fitted for a 2-year-old,\u201d said Dr. Lee Smith, chief of the division of pediatric otolaryngology at the Cohen Children\u2019s Medical Center. Or rather, he said, it would theoretically have been possible, but would have taken millions of dollars to engineer and there would have been no guarantee it would work.\n\nThe advent of 3-D printing has made it not only possible to test medical solutions on the fly, but practical as well.\n\n\u201cOur little activity here at the Feinstein Institute has spawned [about] 10 different hospital departments coming to us asking us to help them use 3-D printing technology,\u201d said Grande.\n\nGoldstein said he envisions a new normal in which doctors are able to print emergency implants of organs and bones, leaving no patient wanting for new parts. \u201cImagine having a 3-D printer in every emergency room,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could print replacement parts on demand.\u201d\n\nHe marveled at the possibilities. \u201cI think that would be a very nice future.\u201d\n\nSign Up for Health Pulse Brought to you by Crain's New York Business, Health Pulse is a subscription-only website focused on the business of health care.
