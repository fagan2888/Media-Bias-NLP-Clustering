The debut will be followed by the introduction of similar high-fidelity head-mounted displays, the HTC Vive and PlayStation VR.\n\nDespite comparably offering immersive windows into 360-degreee virtual worlds, each headset has a unique approach to VR, whether it\u2019s the room-detecting capabilities of the Vive or the plug-and-play simplicity of PlayStation VR. Here\u2019s a look at how the three systems are different:\n\n___\n\nOCULUS RIFT\n\nFor early adopters, Oculus will be first to market with a $599 headset that must be connected to a high-powered PC. It\u2019s worth noting that although the Rift officially launches March 28, Oculus has announced that pre-orders have already sold out and new orders won\u2019t be shipped until this summer.\n\nThe headset will come with an Xbox One controller to play included games like space dogfighter \u201cEVE: Valkyrie\u201d and cartoony platformer \u201cLucky\u2019s Tale.\u201d However, Oculus\u2019 intuitive Touch controllers, which can recreate the sensation of hands in VR, won\u2019t be available separately until later this year.\n\nOut: March 28\n\n___\n\nHTC VIVE\n\nFor a higher price than both the Rift and PS VR, the Vive will offer seated and standing gameplay experiences utilizing a pair of sensors capable of monitoring movement in a room. Unlike the other headsets, the Vive features a front-facing camera and sensors to detect what\u2019s in the real world.\n\nAs with the Rift, the Vive needs to be connected to a super-charged PC costing at least $1,000 in order to operate, but the Vive will come with a pair of wand-shaped controllers and games such as \u201cJob Simulator,\u201d \u201dFantastic Contraption\u201d and \u201cTilt Brush\u201d to validate its heftier $799 price tag.\n\nOut: April 5\n\n___\n\nPLAYSTATION VR\n\nSony is offering the least expensive entry into VR at $399. While the Rift and Vive only operate when connected to souped-up PCs, Sony\u2019s version of VR works in tandem with the PlayStation 4 console, which costs around $350 depending on the model, and PlayStation camera, about $60.\n\nStory Continues \u2192", "article_metadata": {"description": "After four years of hype, high-end virtual reality is coming to consumers' living rooms next week with the release of the consumer edition of the Oculus Rift.
