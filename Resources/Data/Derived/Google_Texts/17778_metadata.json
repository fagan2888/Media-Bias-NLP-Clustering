They should shed light on some important question and be \u201cworth knowing.\u201d They do not typically test hypotheses, rely on sophisticated statistical methods, or include lengthy policy discussions.\n\nWe aim to present new data or new analyses of existing data that are reliable and credible and that promote understanding among nonexperts on important, policy-relevant topics. We encourage work based on underused or new data sources.\n\nParameters\n\nLength and Focus\n\nDataWatch papers should relate to important policy topics even as they devote limited space to a policy discussion. The focus should be on highlights of the data and their interpretation and relevance to policy issues.\n\nDiscussion of the data source should be brief, clear, and suitable for nonexpert, lay readers. If you cannot adequately discuss your data and methods within the space of about 200 or 300 words, you should include a technical appendix for review purposes only (designate the file(s) as \u201csupplementary files for review\u201d in the \u201cfile upload\u201d step at the time of submission).\n\nThe total word count for DataWatch papers should not exceed 2,000 words (this total includes text and endnotes, but excludes exhibits). If fewer words will suffice, there\u2019s no need to reach the word limit. We may ask for cuts if we feel that the length exceeds what is necessary.\n\nWe do not publish abstracts for DataWatch papers, but it would be helpful if you would provide one in the space provided in the submission forms since this information is helpful to reviewers. Please include the abstract only in the submission forms; omit it from the document that contains the text, but include in its place a short \u201csubtitle\u201d (50 words) that highlights the main takeaway point from the paper. The abstract should state what your paper is about, why it is important, the data source, and the main observations that the data point to.\n\nExhibits\n\nThe data presented (usually in 4 to 6 tables and/or figures) should tell the story, and we prefer to see the most important exhibit mentioned very early in the paper (within 150 words of the beginning of the paper). This first exhibit should be the exhibit that best shows the article\u2019s main result and should be \u201ceye catching.\u201d\n\nIt often works well to highlight in the opening paragraph or two the main or most interesting finding, then to return to it later if appropriate. We encourage authors to include a variety of exhibits \u2014 tables and different figures, including graphs and maps.\n\nSubmission Requirements\n\nManuscripts should be submitted via Health Affairs\u2018 manuscript submission system.\n\nPapers should be original submissions not previously published or being considered by other journals.\n\nAdditional details and style guidelines are available on Health Affairs\u2018 Web site under \u201cHelp for Authors.\u201d\n\nTiming\n\nThere is no deadline for submissions; DataWatch papers will be considered on an ongoing basis. However, it is expected that papers will deal with topics of interest in a timely way so that data presented are relevant to current policy concerns.\n\nSelection Process\n\nHealth Affairs\u2018 editors will evaluate all submissions to make an initial determination on suitability for the journal. Those papers that advance through this phase will be subjected to external peer review, which will consist of sharing papers with at least two experts. Comments and recommendations of peer reviewers will factor into the journal\u2019s decision on whether or not to select papers for revision and, ultimately, publication.\n\nQuestions\n\nIf you have questions about the suitability of a particular paper, please contact the executive editor at editor@healthaffairs.org.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2015/04/24/call-for-submissions-health-affairs-brings-back-datawatch/", "site_name": "Health Affairs", "image": "http://healthaffairs.org/blog/wp-content/themes/HealthAffairs2015/images/facebook-default.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Call For Submissions: Health Affairs Brings Back DataWatch"}, "description": "Call For Submissions: Health Affairs Brings Back DataWatch | At the intersection of health, health care, and policy.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca55e\"", "article_summary": "ParametersLength and FocusDataWatch papers should relate to important policy topics even as they devote limited space to a policy discussion.\nDataWatch articles are short papers (2,000 words or less) that highlight data that \u201cspeak for themselves\u201d relative to important policy issues or topics.\nAdditional details and style guidelines are available on Health Affairs\u2018 Web site under \u201cHelp for Authors.\u201dTimingThere is no deadline for submissions; DataWatch papers will be considered on an ongoing basis.\nTracy GnadingerApril 24, 2015Health Affairs is now encouraging submissions to its DataWatch section.\nThe total word count for DataWatch papers should not exceed 2,000 words (this total includes text and endnotes, but excludes exhibits)."}
