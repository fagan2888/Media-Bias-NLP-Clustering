Bland says this will help prevent future problems.\n\n\u201cHemphill is doing work trying to shore up this line and protect it over here. We have sheet metal going in about 60 feet into the ground trying to protect the side the IHop is on,\u201d Bland says.\n\nSoon after the collapse, Mayor Bland declared a state of emergency. He says this was done in order to get construction crews working immediately to prevent any further complications.\n\n\u201cWe have those businesses over there pumping retail revenue into our city. Without them, we can\u2019t pay our bills, so this was an emergency situation to protect all of our businesses,\u201d Bland says.\n\nBland says if it wasn\u2019t for the crews getting things cleared out, water would have done further damage by going into businesses across the interstate. He says that\u2019s why declaring a state of emergency was necessary.\n\n\u201cWhen the heavy rains came we were very proud of them because they completed that work just in time. If that would not have happened, we would have had a very critical situation,\u201d Bland says.\n\nThe company doing the work is Hemphill Construction out of Florence Mississippi. Mayor Bland says work should be complete within the next 4 weeks, but a long term plan is still being looked at. It is also uncertain of when IHop might re-open.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "It\u2019s been just over 20 days since the pipe near IHop collapsed and crews have been working almost non-stop to get things back in order.", "language": "english", "author": "Tom Williams", "og": {"url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Crews-Work-to-Stabilize-Collapsed-Area-Near-IHop--357354991.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/Pipe+Collapse+IHop1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "It\u2019s been just over 20 days since the pipe near IHop collapsed and crews have been working almost non-stop to get things back in order.", "title": "Crews Work to Stabilize Collapsed Area Near IHop"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.wtok.com", "description": "It\u2019s been just over 20 days since the pipe near IHop collapsed and crews have been working almost non-stop to get things back in order.", "title": "Crews Work to Stabilize Collapsed Area Near IHop", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Crews-Work-to-Stabilize-Collapsed-Area-Near-IHop--357354991.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/Pipe+Collapse+IHop.jpg", "creator": "@newscenter11", "site": "@newscenter11", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "keywords": "Crews Work to Stabilize Collapsed Area Near IHop", "google-site-verification": "M1YwZ85zoJ2ZNboZjzjADGJ9L53qqzbNOi6FLrtDw9U", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Crews Work to Stabilize Collapsed"}, "article_summary": "He says this was done in order to get construction crews working immediately to prevent any further complications.\nMayor Bland says work should be complete within the next 4 weeks, but a long term plan is still being looked at.\nIt\u2019s been just over 20 days since the pipe near IHop collapsed and crews have been working almost non-stop to get things back in order.\n\u201cHemphill is doing work trying to shore up this line and protect it over here.\n\u201cPart of their contract with us, is to work through the holidays to get this done,\u201d Meridian Mayor Percy Bland says."}
