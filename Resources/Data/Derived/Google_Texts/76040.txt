LAKELAND, FL (WFLA) — Some communities across Florida have some of the most severe shortages of dentists in the entire country, according to the American Dental Association. There are plenty of dentists, they just aren’t practicing in large numbers in rural and lower income areas.

Florida has an average of one dentist for every 1,874 residents. In Polk County, there is just one dentist for every 3,540 people.

Brian Erickson is one of the many Polk County residents who put off dental care until his mouth pain became too much. “I work and even through work, the coverage just isn’t there,” he explained. “I was finally able to get covered through one of the programs at the Health Department, so I could get some fillings I’ve been waiting years to do.”

Senior Dentist Stephen Ebner at the Florida Department of Health‘s Lakeland clinic says economics drive the shortage areas. “It’s just market forces that create that discrepancy,” said Ebner.

Lots of Polk County patients rely on Medicaid, Ebner said. It equals a low profit margin for dentists, which is a definite deterrent to new dental grads. “They have to go to an area where they’re able to pay their loans off,” Ebner explained.

To help fill the gap, some dentists are now regularly volunteering at places like Lakeland Volunteers in Medicine. Other organizations and select dental offices now offer annual free dental events, but the need is still huge. Erickson feels fortunate his mouth finally feels well enough to smile again. “I had to wait so long just to express myself the way I wanted to express myself,” he said.

The Affordable Care Act requires health plans to cover dental services for children, but not adults. The American Dental Association reports a lack of dental coverage is such a problem right now, every 15-seconds someone goes to a hospital emergency room complaining of mouth pain.
