Obama administration manages Healthcare.gov expectations\n\nThe Obama administration will consider the new federal insurance marketplace a success if 80 percent of users can buy health-care plans online, according to officials.

It is now guiding the work of government employees and contractors racing to repair the faulty website by the Nov. 30 deadline.

Woodward says ObamaCare rollout isn't Obama's Watergate\n\nPresident Obama's mishandling of the Affordable Care Act rollout has been incompetent, Bob Woodward said on Fox News Sunday, but it doesn't rise to past president-dooming scandals. \"What this is, it's a mess, clearly, but what it isn't, and I think you have to look at the question of motive. And the president's motive here, even though there were deep problems with the implementation, he wants to do something good for 30 million people and get them health insurance,\" Woodward said. \"So this isn't Watergate, this isn't Clinton and Monica Lewinsky.\" Woodward did say the ACA rollout is a harbinger of bad things to come for Obama's White House.
