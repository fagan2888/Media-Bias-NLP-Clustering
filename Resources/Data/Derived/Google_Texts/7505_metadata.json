And we\u2019ve made a difference in people\u2019s lives.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s true on several issues, he argued, including the economy, climate change and education. And more broadly, he said, it\u2019s the story of America, particularly as it relates to racism.\n\nIn a portion of the interview that attracted immediate attention, the president said that it was \u201cincontrovertible\u201d that race relations had improved in the country during his lifetime, but that the U.S. still has not been \u201ccured\u201d of racism.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just a matter of it not being polite to say \u2018nigger\u2019 in public. That\u2019s not the measure of whether racism still exists or not,\u201d he said. \u201cSocieties don\u2019t overnight completely erase everything that happened 2[00] to 300 years prior.\u201d\n\nA White House spokesman said Monday that the president did not use the racial epithet to be intentionally provocative but that he said it simply during what was a \u201ca free-flowing conversation.\u201d\n\nThe more than hourlong interview, recorded Friday in the garage of Maron\u2019s Highland Park home, came less than a day after Obama renewed his call for stricter gun control in the wake of the mass shooting at a South Carolina church that left nine people dead. The suspect, who is white, had posted a racist manifesto online that was discovered over the weekend.\n\nPresident Obama Jacquelyn Martin / Associated Press President Obama returns to the White House on June 21 after a weekend in California where he attended a fundraiser and recorded an interview with Marc Maron in Los Angeles, spoke to the U.S. Conference of Mayors in San Francisco and played golf in Palm Springs.

And you can\u2019t get cynical or frustrated because you didn\u2019t get all the way there immediately,\u201d he said.\n\nOn healthcare, for instance, it was never going to be possible to replace a healthcare system with public and private insurance markets with one where the government pays for care, which led him to pursue the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cFive years later, we\u2019ve got millions of people who have healthcare that didn\u2019t have healthcare before. We\u2019ve got the lowest uninsured rate that has ever been reported,\u201d he said. \u201cFor a lot of people they\u2019re looking at it and saying, \u2018Well we didn\u2019t get everything we wanted.\u2019 For me what I say to myself is, for those millions of people \u2014 many of whom write to me and say you saved my life \u2014 that\u2019s democracy working. That\u2019s government working.\u201d\n\nIn the end, Obama agreed with Maron\u2019s contention that in some respects the presidency is no more than a middle management position.\n\n\u201cSometimes your job is just to make stuff work,\u201d Obama said. \u201cSometimes the task of government is to make incremental improvements or try to steer the ocean liner 2 degrees north or south so that 10 years from now, suddenly we\u2019re in a very different place than we were. At the moment, people may feel like we need a 50-degree turn, we don\u2019t need a 2-degree turn. And you say, \u2018Well, if I turn 50 degrees, the whole ship turns\u201d over.\n\nArguably no president has had to govern in more hyperactive times, with the 24-7 news environment his predecessors criticized replaced by an even more instantaneous social media age. Obama also lamented what he said was a growing gap between \u201cwho we are as a people and how our politics expresses itself,\u201d and how various factors have led some to grow more cynical about the process. That\u2019s one reason the president made the unconventional choice to sit for an interview in a venue like Maron\u2019s.\n\n\u201cIncreasingly I\u2019ve spent my time thinking about how do I try to break out of these old patterns that our politics has fallen into. Which is part of the reason why I\u2019m here,\u201d Obama said.\n\nThe president said that in part because of his famously cool temperament \u2014 inspired by his upbringing in Hawaii \u2014 he has managed to block out voices demanding more immediate actions.\n\n\u201cLook, are there frustrations in my job? Yes,\u201d he said. But if he is judged by President Reagan\u2019s question of whether you were better off now than you were four years ago, Obama said the answer was unequivocally yes.\n\n\u201cThat is ultimately what you\u2019re looking for, when you wake up every day you say to yourself, \u2018Are things a little bit better?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if you take that long view, then you\u2019re less nervous or stressed about the day-to-day ups and downs.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Obama's message to supporters who want more from him: I'm making progress", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "As much as President Obama has battled Republicans and even fellow Democrats during his administration, he\u2019s faced an equally difficult opponent during his six-plus years in the White House: the expectations that he would fulfill the sweeping promise of change of his 2008 campaign.", "title": "Obama's message to supporters who want more from him: I'm making progress", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-obama-maron-podcast-20150622-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-55882c78/turbine/la-na-obama-maron-podcast-20150622", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp16.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "Obama, race, WTF, Marc Maron", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/83838832", "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2015-06-22", "Description": "As much as President Obama has battled Republicans and even fellow Democrats during his administration, he\u2019s faced an equally difficult opponent during his six-plus years in the White House: the expectations that he would fulfill the sweeping promise of change of his 2008 campaign.
