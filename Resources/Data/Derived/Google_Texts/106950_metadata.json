That list was dramatically shorter than in previous years\n\nLast year, more than 50,000 Hoosiers were on the waiting list for the Healthy Indiana Plan. When the federal government approved the program\u2019s renewal for 2014, it changed the scope of the program, forcing the state to lower the income eligibility ceiling.\n\nThe state\u2019s Family and Social Services Administration contacted Hoosiers on the waiting list, inviting them to reapply if they thought they still met the new eligibility guidelines. Fewer than 5,000 reapplied and of those only about 3,400 are eligible to enroll.\n\nFSSA says those who did not reapply may be eligible for health insurance premium support through the federal healthcare marketplace created by the Affordable Care Act.\n\nClearing the smaller waiting list will still leave 17,000 spots open in the Healthy Indiana Plan. But some estimates say that could still leave hundreds of thousands of Hoosiers without an affordable health insurance option.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The state-run health coverage program is accepting everyone on its waiting list after tightening eligibility requirements.", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.10", "og": {"site_name": "News - Indiana Public Media", "description": "The state-run health coverage program is accepting everyone on its waiting list after tightening eligibility requirements.", "title": "3,400 Hoosiers Eligible For Healthy Indiana Plan | News - Indiana Public Media", "url": "http://indianapublicmedia.org/news/3400-hoosiers-eligble-healthy-indiana-plan-61259/", "image": "http://indianapublicmedia.org/news/files/2014/01/HIP.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@wfiunews", "image": "http://indianapublicmedia.org/news/files/2014/01/HIP.jpg", "description": "The state-run health coverage program is accepting everyone on its waiting list after tightening eligibility requirements.", "card": "summary", "title": "3,400 Hoosiers Eligible For Healthy Indiana Plan"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160118390716029}, "bitly-verification": "f9ab3b0a7f0c", "viewport": "width=device-width,user-scalable=yes,initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdffd3\"", "article_summary": "Photo: Healthy Indiana Plan The Healthy Indiana Plan covers Hoosiers from 22 percent to 100 percent of the poverty line.\nThe Healthy Indiana Plan, the state\u2019s health insurance program for low-income Hoosiers, has added all the applicants from its waiting list to the program for 2014.\nThat list was dramatically shorter than in previous yearsLast year, more than 50,000 Hoosiers were on the waiting list for the Healthy Indiana Plan.\nClearing the smaller waiting list will still leave 17,000 spots open in the Healthy Indiana Plan.\nBut some estimates say that could still leave hundreds of thousands of Hoosiers without an affordable health insurance option."}
