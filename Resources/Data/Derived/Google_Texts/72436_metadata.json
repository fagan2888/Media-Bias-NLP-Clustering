If you can\u2019t even depend on \u201cAmerica\u2019s dad,\u201d then there\u2019s no public figure you can trust.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean you and your kids can\u2019t watch \u201cThe Cosby Show\u201d in reruns. TV Land may have cancelled them, but don\u2019t feel guilty about ordering them on Amazon. With all of the bad reality TV and unfunny, inappropriate comedies on primetime television these days, \u201cCosby\u201d stands out as one of the best, most wholesome bits of pop culture left. I, for one, will be happy to let my kids watch the Huxtables till they are ready for college.\n\nIt\u2019s not because I don\u2019t believe Bill Cosby is guilty of multiple felonies. The evidence on that front looks pretty damning. It\u2019s just that Hollywood and professional sports are filled with jerks, narcissists and criminals. Maybe among celebrities the proportion of rapists and child abusers is the same as in the rest of the population. But it certainly seems a lot higher. We must separate what happens on the field or in fiction from real life, otherwise we\u2019d need to boycott popular entertainment all together.\n\nPerhaps it is a natural inclination to assume that the folks we \u201cspend time with in our living room\u201d each week are actually people we know. And it is certainly true that our celebrity culture has a way of encouraging this. Magazines like Us Weekly and People, websites like TMZ and even shows like \u201cDancing with the Stars\u201d pretend to show us what actors are like \u201cin real life.\u201d\n\nWe want pictures of them without makeup, showing a tiny bit of fat, caught unawares by a camera on the beach. But this too is all part of the fa\u00e7ade.\n\nBut whether they are news anchors or actors or contestants on \u201cThe Biggest Loser,\u201d what celebrities have in common is that they are people we do not really know.\n\nWhen I allow one of my kids to watch a television show, it is not because I am endorsing the moral qualities of the people in it. They are nothing more than a collection of colored pixels and we can make them disappear anytime we want. Like magic.\n\nIf, when my kids get older, they ask me about the behavior of Bill Cosby or anyone else they see on screen, I will explain that though it\u2019s OK to cheer for a team or enjoy an actor\u2019s movies, stars are not people we should look up to.\n\nWhich is depressing. The unwritten social contract used to be that the people who were lucky enough to make millions in acting or sports would show a certain amount of humility, charity and moral fortitude. We didn\u2019t expect perfection, but we at least hoped they would try to be someone worthy of the worship of children.\n\nThat has slowly eroded away, at least since Charles Barkley starred in a 1993 commercial in which he defiantly declared, \u201cI am not a role model.\u201d Scandals used to be covered up; now Charlie Sheen goes on tour with them.\n\nOther celebrities and athletes even have complained about expectations, arguing that being a good person should not be their responsibility just because they are rich and famous.\n\nWell, no, you should be a good person just because it\u2019s the right thing to do. But if you have won life\u2019s lottery, and you\u2019re Ray Rice the running back or Woody Allen the director, is it really too great a burden to imagine how your behavior will influence your fans?\n\nApparently so. A-Rod, Kobe, Tiger . . . why did Derek Jeter elicit such an emotional response at his farewell? Not just because of what he did on the field, but what he didn\u2019t do off of it. I worry we will never see his like again.\n\nTherefore, celebrities, you win. Your decades-long revolt against being role models has come to an end. Whether you\u2019re in a boy band or a third baseman, it\u2019s up to us, the parents, to teach our children the hard truth: You\u2019re bound to be disappointed.\n\nParents seeking role models for their children should consider looking to people they actually know. They may never be as funny as Bill Cosby is, but at least we have a good shot at understanding what they\u2019re about before we let them get into our kids\u2019 heads.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "New York Post", "twitter": {"description": "Stars are not role models.\nIf you didn\u2019t know that before this week, the news that Bill Cosby is an alleged serial rapist should finally put to rest the notion that we can expect celebrities to be", "creator": "@NaomiSRiley", "image": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/cosby111.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=664&h=441&crop=1", "title": "Why Cosby spells the end of the pop culture role model", "site": "@nypost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"post_id\":\"nypost-8080905\"}", "sailthru.tags": "bill-cosby,", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://nypost.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/0b14d9dbf0c711522a906102b60f3da0?s=16", "generator": "WordPress.com", "sailthru.date": "2014-11-22 14:26:18", "sailthru.title": "Why Cosby spells the end of the pop culture role\u00a0model", "nypost-section": "Opinion", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/cosby111.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=231&h=154&crop=1", "description": "Stars are not role models.\r\n\r\nIf you didn\u2019t know that before this week, <a href=\"http://nypost.com/tag/bill-cosby/\">the news that Bill Cosby is an alleged serial rapist</a> should finally put to rest the notion that we can expect celebrities to be good influences on our children.
