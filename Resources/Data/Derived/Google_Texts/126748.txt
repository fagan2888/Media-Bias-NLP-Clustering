EARLY Act Background & Event History: This event was first held in 2009, in response to creating advocacy and awareness about the issues young breast cancer survivors faced. In 2009, Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz authored and introduced the EARLY Act, which President Obama originally signed into law as part of the Affordable Care Act. The EARLY Act directed the CDC to launch a national education campaign to raise awareness of breast cancer in young women. Last year, Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz and Congresswoman Renee Ellmers (N.C. - 02) led the Re-Authorization of the EARLY Act and President Obama signed the bill into law last December, which extended the EARLY Act for another five years.

Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz, who wrote the EARLY Act with significant contributions from the Tigerlily Foundation, said:

"Early detection and prevention of breast cancer are more important than ever. We must never write off young women in their quest to detect and beat breast cancer. As a young survivor, mother and legislator, I will continue to work tirelessly with groups such as the Tigerlily Foundation to secure comprehensive breast health care for all women."

Joan Lunden, shared her personal experience as a fellow breast cancer survivor, and added that:

"Going through a cancer diagnosis and treatment is a confusing and overwhelming process, and the ability to look up to others who have traveled the path before you is extremely helpful. My life and my career took on a whole new meaning, and my passion became my mission by creating the community and founding the online network, ALIVE in 2015."

Tigerlily Foundation is a national breast cancer non-profit, based in Washington, D.C. It was founded in 2007 by Maimah Karmo, and its mission is to educate, advocate for, empower and support young women (15-45), before, during and after breast cancer. The organization is dedicated to global awareness for breast cancer for women under the age of 45.
