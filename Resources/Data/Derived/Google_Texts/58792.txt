Pierre, SD

A Pierre man arrested following a Craigslist police sting has pleaded not guilty to soliciting sex from a minor.



Thirty-nine-year-old Bradley Spoonemore entered his plea Friday. The Capital Journal reports his charges include solicitation of a minor for sex, hiring someone for sexual activity and failing to provide information to the sex offender registry.



Spoonemore was arrested July 9 after police said he had arranged a meeting through Craigslist with someone he thought was a 14-year-old girl. Police say Spoonemore was actually messaging with investigators.



Police say he admitted to sending explicit messages with his email address but that he backed out before the planned meeting.



He was arrested at a Pierre hotel, where police say he told officers he had just paid a woman $100 for sex.
