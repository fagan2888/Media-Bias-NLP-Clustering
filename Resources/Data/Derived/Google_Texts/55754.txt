CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — The renewal of ties between Cuba and the United States complicates matters for Havana’s chief ally, Venezuela, which has been moving in the opposite direction, becoming more stridently anti-American.

Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and leaders across Latin America applauded Cuba’s decision to swap prisoners with the U.S. and Washington’s easing a longstanding embargo on Wednesday. But analysts said the news is bound to shift geopolitical relations across the region and leave Venezuela more isolated.

The restoration of diplomatic relations between the U.S. and the communist island nation came just days after Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro called thousands into the streets to protest American imperialism and said he was thinking about breaking all ties with the “insolent Yankees.”

Last week, the U.S. Congress approved sanctions on high-level officials in Venezuela’s socialist regime.

U.S. allies in Latin America say the resumption of diplomatic relations between the two countries is evidence that nations can work through differences, while members of region’s socialist bloc are saying the news shows that developing countries can triumph over the Yankee empire.
