By contrast, December 2012 was 8 degrees warmer than December 2013 on average.\n\n\"Northeast Oklahoma has really borne some of the worst of that cold weather,\" McManus said.\n\nThis winter has been more \"active\" than 2012-13's winter so far because the jet stream is over the central part of the United States, allowing more storms in Oklahoma's area, he said.\n\nIn addition, most of the state is not in a drought now, compared with December 2012, when most of the state had extreme to exceptional drought conditions.\n\nAlthea Peterson 918-581-8361\n\nTulsa's forecast temperatures\n\nSaturday afternoon high: 46\n\nSaturday overnight low: 14\n\nSunday afternoon high: 22\n\nSunday overnight low: 7\n\nMonday afternoon high: 19\n\nMonday overnight low: 12\n\nTuesday afternoon high: 33\n\nTuesday overnight low: 26\n\nWednesday afternoon high: 36\n\nWednesday overnight low: 30\n\nSource: National Weather Service\n\nWintry weather in Tulsa since Dec. 1\n\n5.1 inches: Total snowfall\n\n0.5 inches: Total ice accumulation\n\n7 degrees: Lowest temperature in December (Dec. 7)\n\n11 degrees: Lowest temperature in January (Thursday)", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Tulsa World", "description": "Snowfall may just be the beginning of another round of wintry weather for the Tulsa area this weekend.", "title": "Snow, record-low temperatures in weekend forecast", "url": "http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/local/snow-record-low-temperatures-in-weekend-forecast/article_d6ec694e-0a17-518b-9847-04602129a5c2.html", "image": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/tulsaworld.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/b/8c/b8c2e1f0-05e6-5e96-8ef6-7686ab85fd98/52c7c6c3a2450.preview-500.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@tulsaworld", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Snowfall may just be the beginning of another round of wintry weather for the Tulsa area this weekend.", "fb": {"app_id": 288003941350366}, "keywords": "low,snow,tulsa,afternoon,overnight,weather,area,forecast,monday,saturday,local,state,news,newshomepage1", "news_keywords": "low,snow,tulsa,afternoon,overnight,weather,area,forecast,monday,saturday,local,state,news,newshomepage1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7cd9\"", "article_summary": "Snowfall may just be the beginning of another round of wintry weather for the Tulsa area this weekend.\nHowever, Lacey said, record-setting lows are possible in the area Sunday night into Monday morning, when single-digit low temperatures are forecast in the Tulsa area.\nMike Lacey, a Tulsa National Weather Service meteorologist, said that up to 2 inches of snow is possible in northeast Oklahoma this weekend, with about an inch of snow expected in the Tulsa area.\n\"There is potential for travel impact,\" Lacey said of Saturday night's snowfall, noting that colder temperatures will keep the snow on surfaces, including roadways.\nAlthea Peterson 918-581-8361Tulsa's forecast temperaturesSaturday afternoon high: 46Saturday overnight low: 14Sunday afternoon high: 22Sunday overnight low: 7Monday afternoon high: 19Monday overnight low: 12Tuesday afternoon high: 33Tuesday overnight low: 26Wednesday afternoon high: 36Wednesday overnight low: 30Source: National Weather ServiceWintry weather in Tulsa since Dec. 15.1 inches: Total snowfall0.5 inches: Total ice accumulation7 degrees: Lowest temperature in December (Dec. 7)11 degrees: Lowest temperature in January (Thursday)"}
