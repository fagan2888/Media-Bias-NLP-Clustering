You have a wealth of data at your fingertips, from safety information to performance, to guide your decision.\n\nThe same is not as true in health care, especially if you\u2019re pricing procedures. A new study from the University of Iowa compared the cost of prostate cancer surgery at 100 hospitals throughout the United States. The quote for the procedure, the researchers found, varied from $10,100 to $135,000, a 13-fold range. (The average price was nearly $35,000, more than double the Medicare reimbursement.)\n\nOnly 10 of the hospitals that provided cost information divulged anesthesia and surgeon costs, key criteria to consider when pricing a surgical procedure. Moreover, just three hospitals provided a hard copy of the charges, further complicating a patient\u2019s ability to compare costs, the study found.\n\n\u201cSuch variability in pricing can produce significant confusion for consumers who are accustomed to the rules of free-market economics, which equate higher fees with higher quality,\u201d write the UI researchers, in the journal Urology. \u201cUnfortunately, in health care, this has not been found to be true.\u201d\n\nProstate disease is a major health concern in the U.S. It accounts for 28 percent of all new cancer diagnoses in men and nearly $12 billion in treatment costs, according to the American Cancer Society. About 138,000 prostate cancer surgeries are performed yearly, according to government figures. Yet despite the commonness of the disease and the frequency of surgeries, getting a reliable, accurate quote is hard to come by.\n\nPart of that is due to the system itself. What hospitals charge for a procedure don\u2019t reflect the actual costs, says Bradley Erickson, assistant professor in urology at the UI and corresponding author on the study. Think of the hospital\u2019s quote as the opening salvo in a negotiation\u2014a give-and-take primarily with the health insurance provider over how much the hospital gets reimbursed. In that scenario, the higher the quote, the more room there is to negotiate, and thus arguably the more the hospital could get reimbursed.\n\n\u201cThese (hospital) charges don\u2019t mean anything,\u201d Erickson notes. \u201cThere\u2019s no weight behind them.\u201d\n\nWhat that all means is the consumer is working with inflated figures, at best, which puts them \u201cat a significant disadvantage,\u201d Erickson says. Even more, the researchers learned there is precious little information about how well hospitals perform prostate cancer surgeries, as they report outcome data mostly only to government agencies.\n\nThat lack of transparency is \u201ca huge problem,\u201d Erickson says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really incentivize any place to improve outcomes, because no one is holding us individually accountable for it.\u201d\n\nThat could be worrisome to health-care consumers who may face higher deductibles under the Affordable Care Act, Erickson notes. \u201cWe\u2019re not ready for it (pricing transparency), because most hospitals can\u2019t tell you how much they charge,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd the ones that do aren\u2019t based on reality.\u201d\n\nAmong the study\u2019s other findings:\n\n\u2022 70 of the 100 hospitals surveyed provided some pricing\n\n\u2022 Of that number, nearly half (33) said they\u2019d discount the procedure, to as much as 80 percent, for pre-pay or promptly paying patients\n\n\u2022 Academic medical centers charged 52 percent more, on average, than nonacademic centers (The UI's estimate was $31,000, below the mean in the survey; the UI also offered a 25 percent discount for pre-paying patients.)\n\n\u2022 Hospitals in the northeast U.S. charged most (at $40,802 on average), while hospitals in the South charged the least ($30,305 on average)\n\n\u2022 Hospitals in the Midwest were the most likely to provide estimates and to offer discounts\n\n\u2022 There was little price difference at centers either when city population is factored or rankings as compiled by U.S. News and World Report\n\nThe prostate-cancer surgery costs survey follows a UI study, published last year in JAMA Internal Medicine, which found hip replacement costs at hospitals nationwide ranged more than ten-fold, from $11,100 to $125,798. The reason, those researchers found, are largely due to the lack of transparency and knowledge how hospitals set their prices.\n\nIt also corroborates findings from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which reported wide price differences for a variety of medical procedures across the U.S.\n\nIn a separate editorial comment in the journal, the authors, from the University of Montreal and Harvard Medical School, write: \u201cThe discrepancy in pricing highlights the substantial incongruity between the actual costs of a surgical procedure and the hospital charges. It would be highly implausible that the exact same procedure is 13 times more expensive to deliver at one hospital relative to another.\u201d\n\nScott Pate, a UI medical student now at the University of Kansas, is the first author on the study, first published in March.
