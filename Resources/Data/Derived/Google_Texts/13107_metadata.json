But from 2006-2010, he was forced to work in Congo\u2019s mining trade by an armed group, the CNDP. \u201cAs a combatant, you're a machine,\u201d he said recently. \u201cYour body and strength belong to your commander. I was ordered to transport minerals for my overseer. My only payment was sparing my life by not being sent to the frontlines.\u201d\n\nRecent critiques by the Cato Institute and in the Washington Post raise concerns about a U.S. law created to address the crimes and atrocities associated with the trade in conflict minerals. These concerns, many of them valid, focus on unemployment linked to the law\u2019s implementation. But demonizing the law itself misses the mark, and risks sabotaging progress underway.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIllegally mined and traded minerals have been and continue to be a significant conflict financer in Congo. They are not the only one, but they are one of the most lucrative. Armed groups siphon millions of dollars by terrorizing mining communities. They rape women abduct c hildren, and extort taxes on the roads in minerals-rich territories.\n\nThe Congressional drafters of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act, known commonly now in Congo as \u201cObama\u2019s law,\u201d recognized that companies have power and responsibility in one of the world\u2019s most embattled regions. The law targeted opaque global supply chains that enabled the illicit mining and smuggling of a treasure trove of minerals from Congo. No longer should companies in the US be allowed to profit by using minerals in their products that may have been plundered under threat of an AK-47, without publicly reporting their potential complicity.\n\nWho profits from stolen minerals in Congo? Indicted war criminals, corrupt officials, army commanders, neighboring countries, and some of the world\u2019s biggest corporations.\n\nHard-working civilian miners are also dependent on Congo\u2019s minerals trade \u2013 whether legal or not. The transition to conflict-free mining does not come without serious costs, including the potential for mass unemployment. The authors of Dodd-Frank mapped out strategies to prevent this problem. But measures to help miners transition to a formal economy and access alternative employment are coming late, and are underfunded. They need more support, now. Realistically, it will take years to build a regulated mining sector and ensure millions of people in Congo who depend on mining for their livelihoods have a safety net.\n\nBut meanwhile, there\u2019s a war going on.\n\nThe world should not turn away from the mass atrocities ongoing in Congo, including civilian death at scales not seen since World War II. Dodd-Frank is one tool to accomplish a critical goal in support of peace: to bankrupt brutal militias and create accountability in global minerals supply chains. Follow-on regional reforms like a new minerals certification system also need to be accelerated, because they\u2019re showing signs of success.\n\nIn 2010, the UN Group of Experts found almost every mining deposit in the Kivu provinces of eastern Congo under the control of an armed group. In contrast, a recent study found that nearly three-quarters of miners at tin, tantalum, and tungsten mines surveyed in eastern Congo no longer work under threat of armed groups.\n\n\u201cWar doesn\u2019t come for one person. It touched all of us,\u201d said Jean Marie, a Congolese miner in a recent interview. \u201cNow we\u2019re selling for five or even seven dollars. We are very happy with this new tagging system.\u201d\n\nBefore 2010, the world lacked any system to cut off a major source of the revenue underwriting violence against Congo\u2019s people. Ending atrocities requires diverse efforts in close coordination. Advocates identified a gap in those efforts and committed to dealing with conflict minerals because the violent pillage was continuing unabated. For those based in the US, we saw one source of the problem in our backyard, our unchecked western markets and companies. Minerals are not the only factor in Congo\u2019s war. Nor will the end of the conflict minerals trade mean an end to all of Congo\u2019s problems.\n\nDemocratic reform, demobilization of militias, ending and preventing violence against women, and sustainable development are all crucial goals that are part of a broad local and global effort to support peace and security in Congo.\n\nConflict free means more than the absence of war. Historically, private sector actors have perpetrated crimes against Congo\u2019s land and people. Companies that invest in Congo\u2019s minerals trade must prevent human rights abuses at their mines, protect biodiversity, and make their activities transparent. And if they violate domestic or international law, they must face consequences.\n\nAnd shopping will not solve wars, as the Post\u2019s Karen Attiah has rightly pointed out. But in our global interdependence, individual purchases in the US or Europe do impact the lives and wellbeing of people under daily threat of violence. Armed with the truth, consumers can be part of a larger strategy in which demand for products sourced legally creates economic incentives toward peace.\n\nCompanies have influence over the fate of Congo\u2019s war and an obligation to reverse their complicity in its protraction. Congo-based watchdog organizations along with tools such as the Enough Project\u2019s consumer electronics rankings and jewelry leaders review help citizens take part in a public, democratic process of holding companies accountable.\n\nArchbishop Rusengo of Bukavu, a staunch Congolese advocate of minerals regulation, has said, \u201cIn the 21st century one can\u2019t continue to exercise the right of the strongest rather than law itself.\u201d Without curbing the financing of war, we cannot hope to see an end to violent oppression of mining communities in Congo. And without illuminating supply chains whose origins are battle zones, we cannot break the links between our own consumer behavior and Congo\u2019s prolonged war.\n\nDranginis is a policy analyst for the Enough Project.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Illegally mined and traded minerals have been and continue to be a significant conflict financer in Congo.", "description": "Illegally mined and traded minerals have been and continue to be a significant conflict financer in Congo.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Congress Blog"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Illegally mined and traded minerals have been and continue to be a significant conflict financer in Congo.", "title": "In defense of 'Obama\u2019s law'", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/foreign-policy/228056-in-defense-of-obamas-law", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:59:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:59-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/foreign-policy/228056-in-defense-of-obamas-law", "dcterms.date": "2014-12-29T09:00-05:00", "dcterms.creator": "Joe Picard", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "author": "Holly Dranginis", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-29T09:00:02-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:59:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/foreign-policy/228056-in-defense-of-obamas-law", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Illegally mined and traded minerals have been and continue to be a significant conflict financer in Congo.", "card": "summary", "title": "In defense of 'Obama\u2019s law'"}, "dcterms.title": "In defense of 'Obama\u2019s law'"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd86fd\"", "article_summary": "Hard-working civilian miners are also dependent on Congo\u2019s minerals trade \u2013 whether legal or not.\nBut from 2006-2010, he was forced to work in Congo\u2019s mining trade by an armed group, the CNDP.\nThe law targeted opaque global supply chains that enabled the illicit mining and smuggling of a treasure trove of minerals from Congo.\nCompanies that invest in Congo\u2019s minerals trade must prevent human rights abuses at their mines, protect biodiversity, and make their activities transparent.\nCompanies have influence over the fate of Congo\u2019s war and an obligation to reverse their complicity in its protraction."}
