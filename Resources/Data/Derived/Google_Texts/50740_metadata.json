She didn\u2019t have money for a new place or even for the plane ticket to make it there, but with her nanny job ending and no way to pay New York rent, her grandfather dying and her parents going through a divorce, she knew home was where she needed to be.\n\n\u201cWhen I came back, I would see people I went to school with, married and doing well \u2013 doing things I thought I would be doing at that age \u2013 and I was living with my parents and working part time,\u201d says DeLeon, now 36. Careless spending on the East Coast paired with a few hospital bills after returning home left DeLeon awash in debt, with seemingly no way to get out.\n\nFinancial stress is far from unusual. Stress in America, a recent report from the American Psychological Association, shows that among more than 3,000 adults surveyed in 2014, 72 percent reported feeling stressed about money within the previous month. About half reported having no emotional support and feeling depressed because of that stress.\n\nCoping With Financial Stress\n\nDeLeon acknowledges that her coping method was flawed. She didn\u2019t pay bills (she didn\u2019t have the money), and her growing depression meant she didn\u2019t have the motivation \u2013 so she didn\u2019t even try.\n\n\u201cI was so buried, I didn\u2019t even know where to start,\u201d she says. \u201cI felt like I was cowering in a corner, telling myself it was going to be OK only so I could continue to sit in that corner and not do anything about it. I was trying to talk myself into doing better and feeling better, but I wasn\u2019t acting on any of it.\u201d\n\nWithout realizing it, DeLeon had stumbled into a cycle of financial stress and depression, with each essentially feeding into the other. The lack of motivation and confidence common in depression leads to further inability to address financial stressors, which only worsens your financial situation.\n\nWhether financial stress is brought on by a specific event, like losing your job, or a combination of factors, psychiatrist David Reiss of Rancho Santa Fe, California, suggests there are three triggers that can send someone from stress to depression.\n\n\u201cOne is the fear of the future,\u201d Reiss says. \u201cThis is the practical side of financial stress: How will I pay my bills? What\u2019s going to happen?\u201d Second, and \u201ceven more significant when talking about the progression to depression, is the feeling of failure, where people feel they are unable to support their family, or they are letting others down, leading to a tremendous sense of guilt.\u201d\n\nFinally, Reiss says, there is the feeling of letting yourself down. In the case of a job loss, for instance, it\u2019s the loss of identity, or the feeling of not being successful enough, not measuring up to one\u2019s own expectations.\n\nAny one of these could spiral into depression, but Reiss says it\u2019s typically a combination of all three.\n\nRecognizing When It\u2019s Not Just Stress\n\nStill, not all stress leads to depression. The latter is a maladaptive response to the former. Reiss, who has worked with the California workers\u2019 compensation system for 25 years, says he differentiates a healthy response to financial stress and one that may need psychological treatment according to how the person recovers.\n\n\u201cIf a person\u2019s not sleeping, not eating, not taking appropriate actions to do what they need to in order to get back on track, that\u2019s where evaluation and treatment is useful,\u201d he says.\n\nIn the case of losing a job, for instance, emotions and daily life will obviously be disrupted, but after a few weeks, most people begin to bounce back. If they don\u2019t begin dusting themselves off and rebounding from the initial setback, it could indicate a more serious problem.\n\nBut Reiss says there\u2019s an even bigger sign that someone needs help: when their condition turns physically dangerous.\n\nFinancial Stress Can Be Lethal\n\nDeLeon\u2019s condition culminated with a suicide attempt in 2005. She had held prior suicidal thoughts at bay, knowing the utter despair would lift, even if just slightly, the next day. But this time, she didn\u2019t put up a fight, taking more than 70 pills, a combination of Flexeril and Benadryl.\n\n\u201cI was in a medically induced coma for three days. I remember coming out of it when they pulled the tube out of my throat,\u201d she says.\n\nOf course, DeLeon\u2019s experience is not the norm. But for people in the throes of depression brought on or merely worsened by financial stress, the risk for self-destructive behavior is real. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that there were more than 40,000 deaths by suicide in 2013, the last year for which data is available.\n\nLike DeLeon, Americans suffering from depression may be too proud or too scared to ask for help, but resources are available for people under the heavy weight of money stress and its emotional effects.\n\nFinding Help\n\nIf you're fortunate enough to have health insurance, it\u2019s likely that your policy covers mental health treatment, an \u201cessential benefit\u201d that's included on all compliant plans under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBut if your financial situation means you\u2019re living without coverage, you\u2019ll have to get creative with your treatment.\n\nReiss says public mental health systems are available, but they are typically backlogged. He suggests contacting local universities, which often have free or low-cost counseling and mental health services. Also, consider support groups through your community center or church. Finally, if you qualify, Medicaid covers mental health treatment.\n\nDeLeon was introduced to the psychiatrist she credits with saving her life when she was in the hospital. She now takes antidepressant medication to manage her depression, is working full time and feels \u201clike a normal person again.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m paying on my debt, and even though I still have bills coming in that maybe I forgot about during that period, it\u2019s easier now,\u201d she says. \u201cI have regular paychecks, my own place, money in a savings account and my fianc\u00e9 and I are saving for our wedding in 2016.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"usn-stitial-fact": "{\"slug\":\"160202\",\"text\":\"Heart disease is the leading cause of death for African American and white women in the U.S.\"}", "usn-comments-mode": "facebook", "description": "A recent report shows 72 percent of adults feel stressed about money.", "zone": "healthandwellness/articles", "author": "Elizabeth Renter", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "A recent report shows 72 percent of adults feel stressed about money.", "title": "The Dark Link Between Financial Stress and Depression", "url": "http://health.usnews.com/health-news/health-wellness/articles/2015/02/25/the-dark-link-between-financial-stress-and-depression", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/55/c5/499aae5d430a987e0422abda2bd0/150225-emptypocketsbw-stock.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A recent report shows 72 percent of adults feel stressed about money.", "site": "@USNews", "card": "summary", "title": "The Dark Link Between Financial Stress and Depression - US News"}, "usn-platform-id": "a", "site": "health-news", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "published_at": "2015-02-25", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/bea020c/2147483647/thumbnail/80x80/quality/85/?url=%2Fcmsmedia%2F55%2Fc5%2F499aae5d430a987e0422abda2bd0%2Fresizes%2F500%2F150225-emptypocketsbw-stock.jpg", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "keywords": "LTHealth [Consumer Advice],healthwellness [Consumer Advice],HWBucket-MentalHealth [Consumer Advice],mental health,depression,stress,money,debt,suicide,Elizabeth Renter", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/usnewsandworldreport", "published_time": "2015-02-25"}, "usn-content-type": "article", "social_id": "http://t.usnews.com/Z6yd91", "viewport": "width=980"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd6aa\"", "article_summary": "But for people in the throes of depression brought on or merely worsened by financial stress, the risk for self-destructive behavior is real.\nFinancial stress is far from unusual.\nFinancial Stress Can Be LethalDeLeon\u2019s condition culminated with a suicide attempt in 2005.\nFinancial stress can bring about a range of emotions, from worrying about paying your bills to feeling like you are a failure.\n\u201cThis is the practical side of financial stress: How will I pay my bills?"}
