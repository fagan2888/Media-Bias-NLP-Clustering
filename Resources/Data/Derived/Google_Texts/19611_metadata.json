Much like the number of Obamacare enrollees, no specific number was provided.\n\nThe Air Force Times reported:\n\nThe Air Force cannot compete with increasingly lucrative offers from the private sector, Fanning said. Private airlines are facing a large number of retirements in their pilot ranks and are going after Air Force pilots to fill their cockpits. That, combined with recent groundings of Air Force squadrons and fiscal uncertainty, is making it difficult to get long-term commitments from pilots in exchange for the bonus.\n\n\u201cThey aren\u2019t taking it because they aren\u2019t flying,\u201d Fanning said. \u201cThey don\u2019t know what their future is.\u201d\n\nPilots have become \u201cbored\u201d ever since their squadrons have essentially been grounded, according to Chief of Staff Gen. Mark Welsh\u2019s Nov. 7 testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re planning to leave the Air Force, but it certainly means they are keeping their options open, at a minimum,\u201d he said.\n\nThat attitude has filtered down to enlisted personnel, who want to find something \u201ca little more exciting\u201d now that their squadrons aren\u2019t flying, Welsh added.\n\nThirteen fighter squadrons were grounded in fiscal year 2013 because of sequestration. Many of the remaining squadrons have had their flying time cut back, leaving the United States at a reduced state of readiness.\n\nThe Air Force Times reported:\n\nIf the budget cuts continue, the Air Force will be forced to ground more squadrons in both fiscal 2014 and 2015, Fanning said. The service also would be forced to cut 25,000 airmen and more than 500 aircraft over the next five years, with most of the cuts coming sooner rather than later.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to take five years to dig out of this,\u201d Fanning said Thursday at a Defense One summit in Washington, D.C., the Times reported.\n\nThankfully, however, the first lady\u2019s \u201cLet\u2019s Move!\u201d campaign is still fully funded.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t already, be sure to check out Texas mom speaks out about viral letter to Obama: \u2018I\u2019m one of millions\u2019\n\n[poll id=\u201d138\u2033]", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "The Obama administration is finding out that not even six-figure bonuses can keep experienced military pilots in the Air Force \u2014 they just want to fly.
