In the agency\u2019s report, it stated the product involved could cause dogs to vomit, have diarrhea or bloody diarrhea, come down with a fever, or be lethargic. If people haven\u2019t thoroughly washed their hands after coming in contact with the chews, they may also face risks for infection, which comes with similar symptoms.\n\nIn rare cases, Salmonella can result in arterial infections, endocarditis, arthritis, muscle pain, eye irritation, and urinary tract symptoms, the FDA states. To date, no illnesses have been reported as a result of the dog chews.\n\nThe product was distributed from Nylabone\u2019s headquarters in Neptune, N.J. to states nationwide and in Canada. The FDA encourages all consumers to return the dog chews for a full refund.\n\nThe product comes in a 1.69 oz. package marked with Lot #21935, UPC 0-18214-81291-3, located on the back of the package, and with an expiration date of 3/22/18 also stamped on the back of the package.
