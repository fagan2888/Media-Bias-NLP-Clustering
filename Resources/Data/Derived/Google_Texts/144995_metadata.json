They were also given the chance to respond to allegations made in the other candidate\u2019s campaign ads\n\n\"The claims made in that ad are simply false. Of course he doesn't cite anything. He claims I support Nancy Pelosi, which I do not. He claims I support the Affordable Care Act, which I have publicly stated I have a lot of problems with. And again he claims I support amnesty, which no one proposes. So again he doesn't understand the definition of amnesty,\u201d said Mowrer.\n\nKing said, \"No member of Congress that I know of gets free health care for life, none. No member of Congress while I was there had the opportunity to vote for free health care for life. No member of Congress had the opportunity to vote on a raise while I was there. I had one opportunity to freeze my pay. I did that. My pay has been frozen since 2009.\"\n\nInitially King refused to take part in the debate because of a Mowrer ad he claimed was false.\n\nMowrer's campaign did not pull the ad, claiming everything in it was backed up by King\u2019s voting record.", "article_metadata": {"description": "STORM LAKE, Iowa -- A heated debate took place Thursday night as the two candidates running for the 4th District congressional seat met up for their first and only debate.
