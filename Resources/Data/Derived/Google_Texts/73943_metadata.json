Robert Kennedy stands before the delegates at the Democratic National Convention in Atlantic City, N.J. (AP Photo) (Photo: AP)\n\nEDITOR: In the film \u201cRFK,\u201d Bobby tries on Jack\u2019s bomber jacket and is talking to Jack\u2019s ghost. He says, \u201cThings don\u2019t make sense anymore, Jack.\u201d As I write this, CNN is airing a segment on evangelicals and the White House. Remember church and state, fellas? The Bible is 100 percent accurate when thrown at close range. Jack and Bobby, you left us a superlatively well-educated people, possessing all the skills needed to build or destroy on an impressive scale. If you were alive today, you\u2019d be in D.C. in 72 degrees being bitten by December mosquitoes.\n\nAnd those guns that assassinated you two: Every 10 minutes a life is lost to a gun in America. The third anniversary of Sandy Hook produces the Worst Responders. On Black Friday, a gun was sold every two seconds. We interrupt Dr. Phil for today\u2019s Mass Shooting Melee. A light, breezy afternoon shooting, just four dead. There is another term for \u201cwell-regulated militia\u201d: police force. If you want a gun, join one.\n\nBrace yourselves, Jack and Bobby: The middle class has been destroyed by billionaires. We still love America, but the greatest flaw in American culture is blind self-absorption. As a member of the TV Generation, I sincerely apologize. If this country elects a vulgarian reality show host president, it\u2019s time for a constitutional amendment forbidding Americans from ever watching TV again.\n\nThe modern GOP\u2019s basic premise seems to be that it doesn\u2019t want government to work. It appears the nation is weary of a mentally stable president. Sarah Palin was a gateway drug; now the GOP needs the hard stuff: Donald Trump. The rise of Trump is explained not so much by the hatred of Muslims, but rather the hatred of one Muslim, who isn\u2019t a Muslim.\n\nJack and Bobby, in 2016, we pledge to declare a moratorium on lunacy and hate. In 2016, Democrats will rebuild the American Dream. By the way, Teddy turned out to be magnificent. Thank you, Brothers Kennedy.\n\nJody Hurrish\n\nStevens Point\n\nTo submit a letter to the editor, visit: http://static.stevenspointjournal.com/submit-letter/\n\nRead or Share this story: http://spjour.nl/1V4LtxM", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "If they were alive today, what would they think?", "og": {"site_name": "Stevens Point Journal Media", "description": "If they were alive today, what would they think?", "title": "Letter to Jack and Bobby Kennedy on 2016 politics", "url": "http://www.stevenspointjournal.com/story/opinion/readers/2016/01/19/letter-jack-bobby-kennedy-politics/78994010/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/stevenspointjournal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "If they were alive today, what would they think?", "title": "Letter to Jack and Bobby Kennedy on 2016 politics", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/439bb2cbe76d5be3c5b7375d13016cdbdd965ba1/c=492-0-2509-2017&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/01/19/StevensPoint/B9320546747Z.1_20160119080355_000_GM9D66KR1.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@StevensPointJRL", "site": "@StevensPointJRL", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=884242174", "fb": {"app_id": 116784471723374}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "Jack and Bobby, in 2016, we pledge to declare a moratorium on lunacy and hate.\nJack and Bobby, you left us a superlatively well-educated people, possessing all the skills needed to build or destroy on an impressive scale.\nBrace yourselves, Jack and Bobby: The middle class has been destroyed by billionaires.\nHe says, \u201cThings don\u2019t make sense anymore, Jack.\u201d As I write this, CNN is airing a segment on evangelicals and the White House.\nJody HurrishStevens PointTo submit a letter to the editor, visit: http://static.stevenspointjournal.com/submit-letter/Read or Share this story: http://spjour.nl/1V4LtxM"}
