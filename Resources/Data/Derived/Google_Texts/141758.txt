Without giving too much away, Sen. Ted Cruz said Tuesday morning that he’s giving his own presidential aspirations a close look in advance of 2016.

“It’s certainly something I’m looking at very seriously, and I think we’re at a time of enormous challenge,” Cruz told FOX & Friends. “We are starting a national debate this year about the direction of the Republican party and about the direction of the country. I think the challenges facing us — they’ve never been greater. The Obama economy, it’s not working. Obamacare is a disaster. Our constitutional rights are under assault from Washington. And as we look abroad, it seems like the entire world is on fire right now.”

Cruz’s comments come a day after he delivered a well-received speech at the Heritage Foundation that explored both domestic and foreign policy issues. The Texas Republican pushed for a conservative agenda and cautioned against the “business as usual” politics of D.C. he has cautioned against frequently.

“For all the Republicans saying ‘let’s get things done,’ if we simply settle into business as usual in this town … we will demoralize the millions of men and women who came out in November,” Cruz said.

A bevy of other Republicans have publicly or reportedly talked about their 2016 prospects in recent days, with Sen. Marco Rubio (undecided) and Rep. Paul Ryan (out) commenting, and speculation rising that former Republican nominee Mitt Romney will launch a third consecutive bid. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush was the first potential contender to make an obvious move toward running.
