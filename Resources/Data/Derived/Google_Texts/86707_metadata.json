Then in October, when conservatives attempted to block the implementation of the dysfunctional ObamaCare law, journalists blasted them as lunatic terrorists out to destroy America. (This year\u2019s winners and videos below the jump.)\n\nFirst, the winner of the \"Let Them Eat Dog Food Award, for Freaking Out Over the Sequester\u2019s Puny Cuts.\" On his February 25 radio show, the math-challenged Ed Schultz insisted that the $85 billion cut would amount to \"damn near a third\" of the overall budget, when the reality was it was barely two percent of the total (MP3 audio):\n\n\u201cNow you\u2019ve got a budget of three and a half trillion dollars in this fiscal year. This will take $85 billion out of it. That\u2019s damn near a third....You can\u2019t take 30, you can\u2019t take 30 percent of operational money out and expect to have the same product. You can\u2019t do it! It\u2019s impossible!\u201d\n\nRunner-up in this category: ABC's Josh Elliott, who began the March 1 edition of Good Morning America by trying to scare his audience with a litany of the sequester's supposed horrors:\n\n\u201cDeadline day. Hours, now, until massive government cuts go into effect that could impact every American: jobs vaporizing, flights delayed, even criminals walking free.\u201d\n\nMoving to \"The Kamikaze Award, for Disparaging Conservatives During the Shutdown,\" Politico's chief political columnist Roger Simon took first prize for a snotty October 14 column that included this line:\n\n\u201cQuestion: If Ted Cruz and John Boehner were both on a sinking ship, who would be saved? Answer: America.\u201d\n\nNext up, MSNBC's \"news\" anchor Thomas Roberts \u2014 who is as opinionated as any of that network's left-wing prime time hosts \u2014 scolded Representative Marsha Blackburn on October 15 for \"taking the government hostage\" because of her dislike for ObamaCare:\n\n\u201cCongresswoman, let me ask you though, when it comes to ObamaCare, do you hate ObamaCare more than you love your country?...Because you\u2019ve taken the government hostage through a shutdown, and all the American people \u2014 you\u2019re walking them to a cliff, the economy, and you\u2019re going to push them over one-by-one, based on the fact that you don\u2019t like the ACA. That\u2019s all it is. You don\u2019t like the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nFinally, The Daily Beast's outgoing editor-in-chief Tina Brown accosted Senator John McCain at an October 10 \"Hero Summit\" that her Web site had sponsored, a clip that quickly made its way to MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell Reports:\n\n\u201cThe story of this political crisis is really, you know, the culpability not just of the Republican crazies, but of the Republican non-crazies. I mean, how did we get to the point where Mitch McConnell is Rand Paul\u2019s bitch?... Where\u2019s the heroism in your own party? I mean, why aren\u2019t the moderate Republicans, you know, fighting back? We\u2019re always saying why don\u2019t, you know, the moderate Muslims fight jihad, but, you know, this is jihad.\u201d\n\n\n\nTomorrow, the \"Obama's Orderlies Award,\" for championing the sadly broken ObamaCare law.
