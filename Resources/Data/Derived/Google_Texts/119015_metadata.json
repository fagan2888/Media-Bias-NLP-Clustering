Burwell, in which the court enforced what the Affordable Care Act actually says\u2014namely, that federal subsidies for health insurance are available only through state-run exchanges and not through exchanges set up by the federal government.\n\nThis is important because the majority of states declined to set up those exchanges\u2014deciding to reject a system and a set of obligations foisted on them by Washington. And ObamaCare is just a big, complicated mechanism for delivering subsidies. Without that, all it does is cancel everyone\u2019s insurance policies and force them into more expensive plans they didn\u2019t want. So you can see why ObamaCare\u2019s defenders really need to keep those subsidies.\n\nSo they screamed that the court\u2019s decision was totally ridiculous and implausible\u2014and then up pops a two-year-old video from one of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s architects, Jonathan Gruber, in which he clearly explains that this is exactly what the law says\u2014that denying subsidies on the federal exchanges was a way of pressuring the states to get on board. More recently, Gruber has been telling everyone that this provision was just a typo and was never intended at all. He even claims his 2012 statement was also a mistake, a \u201cspeak-o.\u201d Except that he said the same thing on at least one other occasion. So that gives you a good idea of the honesty of ObamaCare\u2019s supporters.\n\nBut the big question is: why do they think they can get away with this? Why do they think they can write something into the law, go around for a couple of years explaining that provision to audiences, and then pretend later that it wasn\u2019t there at all and it\u2019s patently ridiculous for anyone to think it ever was?\n\nPartly this a measure of crass partisanship, and partly it\u2019s a measure of desperation. Without the subsidies, what happens to ObamaCare? And without ObamaCare, what does their messiah have to show for his presidency?\n\nBut this also fits into a larger context. They think they can get away with rewriting the law on the fly because of the way we legislate now. For more than a century, it has become increasingly common for Congress to write laws that declare a broad, vague goal without clearly defining the specifics of its implementation\u2014and then leave it to bureaucrats in federal agencies to fill in the blanks.\n\nThis began with the antitrust laws, which banned \u201crestraint of trade\u201d without defining what that meant, leaving it to the courts to make the law as they went along\u2014or, more often, leaving it to the arbitrary prosecutorial discretion of the Department of Justice and the FTC.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen it more recently with the Supreme Court\u2019s 2007 ruling allowing the EPA to control carbon dioxide emissions under the 1990 Clean Air Act, despite the fact that Congress had the opportunity to add such an authorization and declined to do so. The court\u2019s reasoning was that the Clean Air Act gives the EPA power over everything in the air, and how it uses that power is up to the agency, not Congress, to decide.\n\nThis is also why ObamaCare was filled with exemptions and waivers and created a vast bureaucracy whose jobs were to write thousands of more pages of rulings about what ObamaCare would do. And this is why we had to pass the law to find out what\u2019s in it.\n\nWith previous regulations, the abdication of power from Congress to the executive branch agencies was a way of evading responsibility for unpopular decisions. When executive agencies promulgate some outrageously costly or intrusive regulation, elected politicians can tsk-tsk and pretend it has nothing to do with them.\n\nIn this case, the ad hoc rewrites are driven by an implicit admission that Capitol Hill\u2019s super-genius central planners could not actually project the law\u2019s results or design a workable system. So when major parts of the law don\u2019t work out the way they thought they would\u2014one after another\u2014they\u2019re scrambling to save the system by reinventing it ad hoc. And they don\u2019t want any fussy ideas about the letter of the law to get in their way.\n\nThe mentality behind this is on perfect display in the mental gyrations of one defender of ObamaCare, who goes so far as to claim that the definition of \u201cstate\u201d\u2014as in the 50 states\u2014is unclear in the law, despite being explicitly defined multiple times. As ridiculous as this is, notice what use he makes of this alleged ambiguity.\n\nWhat matters is that whether the wording was sloppy or deliberate doesn\u2019t change the fact that it\u2019s ambiguously written, which means you have to look at the context in the other thousand-plus pages of the law to figure out what the intent was\u2026and the name of the law itself is the \u201cPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act\u201d. \u201cAffordable\u201d is right there in the name\u2026and screwing over people in 2/3 of the country by making them pay 3-4x as much for their insurance as people in the other 1/3 of the country isn\u2019t exactly \u201cAffordable.\u201d\n\nAnother defender chimes in with a similar argument:\n\nCongress\u2019s inconsistent use of the phrase \u201cestablished by the State\u201d gives rise to an ambiguity as to its meaning. And when you\u2019ve got an ambiguity, it\u2019s up to the agencies charged with interpreting the ACA to resolve that ambiguity. The tie goes to the government.\n\nGet that? No matter how many impenetrable pages of verbiage were contained in the original law, it\u2019s all equivocal and meaningless and can be endlessly reinterpreted by executive bureaucrats, so long as they believe they are working toward the aspiration named in the law\u2019s title: \u201caffordable care.\u201d\n\nThat, ladies and gentlemen, is how we legislate now. What used to be a \u201claw\u201d is now just an open-ended grant of power coupled with a vague aspiration. Nothing in between, none of the actual concrete provisions of the law, has any meaning or makes any difference.\n\nIf you understand that context and that mentality, then you can see why ObamaCare\u2019s defenders were so confident\u2014and in many cases remain confident\u2014that they get to skate on following the actual letter of the law. They believe no one will hold them to it, not the courts, not the press, not the public, because that\u2019s the system they\u2019re already living in.\n\nIt\u2019s the way we legislate now, which is to say that we don\u2019t pass any real legislation at all.", "article_metadata": {"item-publish-date": "Mon, 28 Jul 2014 07:48:34 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "The Federalist", "description": "ObamaCare's defenders think they can rewrite the law on the fly because that's how we legislate now.", "title": "Halbig Shows How We Legislate Now", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Obama_signs_health_care-20100323.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-07-30T07:11:46+00:00", "url": "http://thefederalist.com/2014/07/28/halbig-shows-how-we-legislate-now/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Federalist", "description": "ObamaCare's defenders think they can rewrite the law on the fly because that's how we legislate now.", "creator": "@Tracinski", "image": {"src": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Obama_signs_health_care-20100323.jpg"}, "title": "Halbig Shows How We Legislate Now", "site": "@FDRLST", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article": {"section": "Health Care", "tag": "Halbig,Halbig v Burwell,Jonathan Gruber,Obamacare,regulation,separation of powers", "published_time": "2014-07-28T07:48:34+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-30T07:11:46+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "ObamaCare's defenders think they can rewrite the law on the fly because that's how we legislate now."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd914f\"", "article_summary": "They think they can get away with rewriting the law on the fly because of the way we legislate now.\nIt\u2019s the way we legislate now, which is to say that we don\u2019t pass any real legislation at all.\nMore recently, Gruber has been telling everyone that this provision was just a typo and was never intended at all.\nWithout that, all it does is cancel everyone\u2019s insurance policies and force them into more expensive plans they didn\u2019t want.\nNothing in between, none of the actual concrete provisions of the law, has any meaning or makes any difference."}
