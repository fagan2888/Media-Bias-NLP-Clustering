Here\u2019s a fun story that might help you answer that question.\n\nWhen Brian Schweitzer first ran for office in 2000, he filled out an NRA candidate questionnaire and mailed it in. The NRA uses this item to rate candidates with a letter grade (A+ to F) and to make endorsements.\n\nSchweitzer (for whom I worked for several years) grew up on a ranch and owned guns and hunted his whole life, and based on his responses to the survey, he figured he would get an A or A- rating. While he didn\u2019t expect the NRA to endorse him (his opponent, the GOP incumbent Conrad Burns, was a lifelong A-plus member), Schweitzer\u2019s rating would nonetheless be published in the NRA\u2019s annual voter guide, sent to all NRA members. That would be a very valuable credential in conservative Montana, as a counterweight to his liberal social and economic ideas.\n\nBut when the NRA voter guide was published, Schweitzer received an F. He called the NRA to demand an explanation. They claimed they never received his questionnaire. It must have gotten lost in the mail, they told him. Schweitzer faxed them a copy, but they said it was too late. Soon Charlton Heston was visiting Montana, campaigning against Schweitzer, accusing him of being \u201cagainst gun rights.\u201d The NRA followed up with similar attacks, spending a king\u2019s ransom on TV and radio ads against Schweitzer, for his F rating. He lost by under 4,000 votes.\n\nIn 2004 Schweitzer took another shot, this time for governor, trying to become the first Democrat elected in Montana in 23 years.\n\nOnce again he mailed in his NRA survey, confident of an A (I believe that at the time, an A-plus rating was only achievable by answering \u201cyes\u201d to the question, \u201cDo you support the right to possess guns in all places, including schools?\u201d).\n\nFor insurance, he met with NRA staff in Washington. They assured him that he was likely to receive the endorsement. But then the voter guide arrived, and the NRA had endorsed his opponent.\n\nAgain he demanded an explanation. The NRA said they\u2019d decided that Schweitzer\u2019s opponent \u201cshould get the benefit of the doubt\u201d because he was an incumbent, whereas Schweitzer had never held office.", "article_metadata": {"description": "To see how the gun group really does business, go behind the scenes with this candidate as he sought their backing", "author": "Eric Stern", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "To see how the gun group really does business, go behind the scenes with this candidate as he sought their backing", "title": "What the NRA\u2019s really shooting for: Getting Republicans elected to office", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/12/20/nras_partisan_hackery_exposed_the_unbelievable_inside_story_of_its_war_on_one_democrat/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/12/schweitzer_lapierre.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "To see how the gun group really does business, go behind the scenes with this candidate as he sought their backing", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/12/schweitzer_lapierre.jpg", "title": "What the NRA\u2019s really shooting for: Getting Republicans elected to office", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "What the NRA\u2019s really shooting for: Getting Republicans elected to office", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, brian schweitzer, Democratic Party, endorsements, Gun Control, Guns, Montana, NRA, Republican Party", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1cd0\"", "article_summary": "But when the NRA voter guide was published, Schweitzer received an F.
