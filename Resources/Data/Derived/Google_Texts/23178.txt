Veritas Adds Riverside’s Emergency Communications Network

The buyer also owns aerospace business StandardAero and cybersecurity group BeyondTrust

Veritas Capital is buying Emergency Communications Network from the Riverside Co. for an undisclosed amount.

ECN, headquartered in Ormond Beach, Florida, is a software-based mass notification system that allows the government and corporations to communicate with constituents about emergency situations.

New York and Cleveland-based Riverside has backed ECN since 2011, and used the companys services to communicate with employees during Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Riverside made several add-on acquisitions to the company, including Dean Alert, in July, and DeltAlert, in 2013. Other purchases include: CityWatch of Bloomington, Minnesota; One Call Now's government outreach clients; Emergency Notification; and First Call. The firm won Mergers & Acquisitions M&A Mid-Market Seller of the Year Award for 2014 after making 19 exits.

Veritas, headquartered in New York, is a private equity firm that invests in government and commercial service providers. The firms other investments include aerospace business StandardAero, which it bought in May, and cybersecurity business BeyondTrust.

Kirkland & Ellis provided legal advice to Riverside, and William Blair acted as financial adviser. Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom LLP advised Veritas on the deal.
