Sure, there are still plenty of big names planned for the main stage and enough hoopla to create a political Super Bowl atmosphere in Washington.\n\nBut organizers of the 2015 event that opens Wednesday at National Harbor Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center are executing what they hope will be a \u201cback to the future\u201d strategy that recaptures the intimacy and focus on activism from the early days of CPAC four decades ago.\n\nThe stage is designed to put big-name speakers closer to the audience so they can answer questions. The first day of the event is dominated by an activism \u201cboot camp.\u201d Breakout sessions the rest of the week aim to give the thousands of conservatives in attendance specific training, right down to PowerPoint slides and handouts they can take home with them.\n\nPHOTOS: Conservatives in Hollywood: Celebrities who lean right\n\n\u201cWhen it first started it was in a small room, probably a couple hundred people. I\u2019ve had some people tell me it was pretty small. It was intimate. And now we\u2019re big. It\u2019s hard to be intimate when you\u2019re big. We\u2019re trying to recapture that intimacy,\u201d said Matt Schlapp, chairman of the American Conservative Union, which organizes CPAC.\n\nACU Executive Director Dan Schneider\u2019s mantra to staff crafting the agenda has been clear: \u201cReally make a difference.\n\n\u201cJust having a nice conference where people can have fun and can network with each other has value. It\u2019s a very good thing when conservatives can come together from around the country and interact with each other and be reminded that there are others who care deeply about the future of our nation,\u201d he said. \u201cBut while we\u2019ve got all these people at this conference, this is a golden opportunity to make sure that they are better citizens, better activists and strengthened to make real change in a positive direction.\u201d\n\nSEE ALSO: \u2018Duck Dynasty\u2019 star Phil Robertson to receive CPAC free-speech award\n\nThis is the first full year that Mr. Schlapp and Mr. Schneider have put their imprint on CPAC. Both were brought in last year as part of a leadership overhaul at ACU designed to prepare the group to serve a new generation of conservatives.\n\nAfter last year\u2019s conference, which focused on campaignlike speeches from Donald Trump, Sen. Rand Paul and Sen. Ted Cruz followed by topical panels, ACU organizers surveyed conference attendees and found that while many enjoyed CPAC, hardly anyone could describe what they learned during the conference.\n\n\u201cWhat we have done this year is designed the program to enhance the experience for the activist. They\u2019re our customer,\u201d Mr. Schlapp said.\n\nSo CPAC\u2019s leadership set three goals for the 2015 event.\n\n\u201cWe want to deepen and broaden the base of knowledge of our attendees. We want to equip the attendees with skills so they can become better activists, and we want to genuinely motivate them to use those new skills and the new knowledge to change America and restore freedom,\u201d Mr. Schneider said.\n\nWhile big speakers like Sen. Marco Rubio, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush will be the main attractions, those speeches will be more topic-focused and each speaker will take questions from the audience, making them more accessible to activists.\n\nThe stage is designed to contribute to the more intimate atmosphere. Speakers will stand at the end of a long runway that stretches to the center of the room, surrounded by the audience.\n\n\u201cWe have to deal with the architecture of the room, and it has a big built-in stage, and what we\u2019ve tried to do is diminish that and have the speakers come out,\u201d Mr. Schlapp said. \u201cThe goal is, you know, if you were to have a town hall meeting or come to a community that you grew up in to hear these people speak, what would be the venue? It would be something where you would feel like you can reach out and touch them, and we want to do the same thing. It\u2019s symbolic, but it\u2019s also real in that we believe that these activists should be able to have a lot more interaction with the speakers.\u201d\n\nFollowing each speech on the main stage, there will be PowerPoint slides with main takeaways from the speech and suggestions on how to get involved in activism.\n\n\u201cYou can inspire an activist to really want to throw themselves into something. That is a magical thing. We\u2019ve just got to make sure that a lot of time doesn\u2019t elapse between that magic and when they sign up and start implementing,\u201d Mr. Schlapp said.\n\nThe Washington Times is a sponsor of CPAC, and this year the newspaper will showcase some of its reporting experts on topical panels, plus host its own panel discussion Thursday on the impact of regulations on innovation and freedom. The newspaper also is hosting its second annual Washington Times Idol competition on the main stage where 10 aspiring journalists from the National Journalism Center interview major newsmakers, get graded by celebrity journalist judges and compete for an all-expenses-paid internship at The Times this summer.\n\nWhile topic-focused panel discussions have been staples at CPAC for years, this time organizers have planned more breakout panels that take the bigger panel discussions and break them down further into focused lectures with two or three speakers.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we want to take away the entertainment value, the idea that people get enthused. We don\u2019t want to lose that, but we want to make sure that these activists from around the country get a change to dig in a little bit on some of these issues that they care about. We hope we strike the right balance,\u201d Mr. Schlapp said.\n\nThe education and training won\u2019t stop once CPAC ends. Organizers at the ACU have been ramping up their own offerings and policy centers to make CPAC a year-round resource for conservatives.\n\n\u201cOur internal vision is \u2018CPAC 365.\u2019 Imagine not just having a great conference over the course of these three days, but what happens on the other days of the year?\u201d Mr. Schlapp said, adding that the ACU has already started ramping up its policy process and getting into contact with scholars and specialists to keep the CPAC conversation going.\n\n\u201cThis conference is bigger and more impactful than ever, both on the activism side and on the knowledge side,\u201d Mr. Schneider said.\n\nFor conservatives just passing through who might not have time to see all of the offerings at this year\u2019s CPAC, Mr. Schlapp said, just walking around and taking in the energy that CPAC generates is inspiring.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s inspiring, in a time when we\u2019re told that conservatives skew older and Republicans skew older and we\u2019re not hip and we\u2019re not now. When you walk around CPAC, it skews younger conservatives from all stripes and walks of life and it really is inspiring. It reminds us all that we\u2019re not alone, we\u2019ve got a lot of allies, including some colorful allies, and there\u2019s a lot of people in this country that want to get the country on the right direction. To me, that\u2019s so hopeful,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "From the stage to the schedule, there's something palpably different about this year's Conservative Political Action Conference.
