Before that, the teachers had not received a pay raise since 2008 as the district tightened its belt during the economic downturn, Superintendent Alfonso Gamino said.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is, when finances were tough, our teachers came through. They understood, \u2018You know what? There\u2019s no money,\u2019\u201d Gamino said. \u201cBecause they helped us in these lean years, we felt that 5 percent was a reasonable number and we could afford it and we could maintain a healthy balance at the end of the year.\u201d\n\nThe agreement approved Wednesday with the local teacher\u2019s union also changes the structure of health plan contributions. Instead of everyone paying the same $253 a month toward their health care premium as they did last year, regardless of family size, contributions will now be tiered, said Assistant Superintendent Donna Rose. A single person will pay $125 a month, a family of two will pay $250 a month, and a larger family will pay $456 a month, she said.\n\nRose said changes to the health plan were necessary for the district to avoid paying the so-called \u201cCadillac tax\u201d as prescribed by the Affordable Care Act. Beginning in 2018, the federal legislation subjects employers to a 40 percent tax if premiums for health care coverage exceed certain limits.\n\nAltogether the salary increases are expected to cost $1.2 million, with a one-time cost of $351,864 for health and welfare benefits, according to a district report.\n\nIn line with the teachers\u2019 raises, the board also approved a 5 percent pay raise for about 18 credentialed managerial staff, such as school principals and assistant principals. That will cost the district $148,000.\n\nIn addition, school board members approved a 5 percent raise in their monthly stipend, which amounts to an extra $12.60 a month. Board members will now receive $264.60 a month, effective Aug. 1.\n\n\u201cThe board members do their job because they want to do their job, they\u2019re not doing it for the pay,\u201d said Gamino. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of time and commitment and effort.\u201d\n\nGamino said the district is still negotiating a contract with its classified staff.\n\nThe superintendent noted that the district has also increased programs and services for students, adding new counselors, health workers, reading specialists and custodial staff.\n\nEarlier this year the board approved a $62 million budget that includes about $10 million in extra state funding over the 2014 to 2015 school year.\n\nAdditional funds will be spent on new technology, teaching materials, staff training, support programs for students and parents, and to carry out several capital improvements projects.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Raises approved for Santa Paula Unified", "og": {"url": "http://www.vcstar.com/news/education/schoolwatch/raises-approved-for-santa-paula-unified-ep-1242324918-351105161.html", "image": {"width": 337, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/santapaulasupe3_23088720_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "height": 480}, "type": "article", "description": "With the economic turnaround, the district has more funds to give teachers and other staff a 5 percent increase in salary.", "title": "Raises approved for Santa Paula Unified"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/santapaulasupe3_23088720_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "description": "With the economic turnaround, the district has more funds to give teachers and other staff a 5 percent increase in salary.", "site": "https://twitter.com/vcstar", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Raises approved for Santa Paula Unified"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-vcs-icon-144.png", "__sync_contentCategory": "premium", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1bb1\"", "article_summary": "SHARE Star File photo Santa Paula Unified Superintendent Alfonso GaminoBy Claudia Boyd-BarrettAlmost 300 teachers in the Santa Paula Unified School District will get a 5 percent salary boost this school year, their second pay raise in a row since the Great Recession.\nThe district\u2019s board unanimously approved the raise Wednesday, which adds to a 5 percent salary increase from last school year.\nIn addition, school board members approved a 5 percent raise in their monthly stipend, which amounts to an extra $12.60 a month.\nEarlier this year the board approved a $62 million budget that includes about $10 million in extra state funding over the 2014 to 2015 school year.\nIn line with the teachers\u2019 raises, the board also approved a 5 percent pay raise for about 18 credentialed managerial staff, such as school principals and assistant principals."}
