On Monday, Jan. 25, the frontrunner for the US Republican presidential nomination finally got specific.\n\nAddressing a crowd in Farmington, New Hampshire, Trump repeated his promises to repeal the Affordable Care Act behind Obamacare (always a sure bet with conservative voters). Then he called for national social insurance program Medicare to be able to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies in order to lower drug prices\u2014a decidedly liberal position that most Republican politicians reject.\n\nTrump claimed such a policy would save Medicare \u201c$300 billion a year,\u201d according to the Associated Press.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t do it. Why? Because of the drug companies,\u201d he added, echoing president Barack Obama and Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, all of whom have criticized the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s price points and called for greater negotiating powers on behalf of Medicare.\n\nThis new stances recalls some of Trump\u2019s earlier pronouncements regarding universal health care: \u201cI want people taken care of in the country, okay? You can call it anything you want,\u201d he told radio host John Fredericks in Jul. 2015. \u201cI would put forward a comprehensive health care program and fund it with an increase in corporate taxes,\u201d he added.\n\nIt\u2019s certainly an odd policy proposal to come from the leading Republican candidate. And importantly, it highlights yet another instance where Trump diverges from the establishment pack, to his benefit.\n\nWhile you could argue that Trump\u2019s approach to health care is just as scattershot and nonsensical as the rest of his campaign, it\u2019s worth noting that his support base is among working-class whites\u2014people with families and budgets. A Sept. 2015 poll from Public Policy Polling found that half of Trump\u2019s supporters nationwide support increasing the federal minimum wage to at least $10 an hour\u2014in other words, they\u2019re money-conscious people. And to them, the difference between market-priced and Medicare-negotiated pharmaceuticals may be significant.\n\nThere may already be an unspoken affinity for socialized medicine among Republican voters. A Commonwealth Fund poll conducted in 2013 and 2014 found that 74% of Republicans enrolled were satisfied with their Obamacare coverage. A Gallup poll from 2014, however, found that 87% of Republicans disapproved of the law that created Obamacare. In other words, it\u2019s not \u201c-care\u201d that Republicans object to. It\u2019s \u201cObama.\u201d\n\nReplacing Obamacare with a similarly progressive health-care policy (\u201cTrumpcare,\u201d as one of Texas senator Ted Cruz\u2019s super PACs has taken to calling it), might seem hypocritical given the party\u2019s history. But that doesn\u2019t make it any less shrewd a campaign strategy.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Donald Trump has said in the past that he wants\u00a0to replace Obamacare\u00a0with \u201csomething terrific,\u201d\u00a0but never really explained what that would be.\u00a0On Monday, Jan. 25,\u00a0the frontrunner for the US Republican presidential nomination\u00a0finally got specific.
