It all began with a groin injury in 2008, he later said in an interview with The Huffington Post.\n\n\"I woke up the next day and my scrotum was the size of a honeydew melon,\" he told reporters. \"My personal hell was just beginning.\"\n\nWarren\u2019s unusual hell escalated quickly. With each passing month, his scrotum grew by 3 lbs., eventually forcing him to wear a hooded sweatshirt as pants. But with no health insurance, his options were limited.\n\nBy the time national media began extending offers to foot the $1 million surgery bill in exchange for interview rights, Warren\u2019s scrotum had reached 132 lbs. \"Even when I got offers to help, it was hard,\" he said. \"My scrotum was so large I couldn't get on a plane. I was too big to use an airplane restroom.\"\n\nHe would eventually endure 13 hours of surgery led by Dr. Joel Gelman, director of the Center for Reconstructive Urology at the University of California, Irvine. He awoke from the procedure 200 lbs. lighter. \u201cThere are a lot of shows about makeovers, but this is a real makeover,\u201d Gelman told local media last April. \u201cHe\u2019s basically a new man.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "wesley warren jr, scrotal lymphedema, scrotum, joel gelman", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Wesley Warren Jr., scrotal lymphedema sufferer whose scrotum grew to 132 lbs., died in a Las Vegas hospital on Friday.", "title": "Man With 132-Pound Scrotum Dead At Age 49 [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/wesley-warren-jr-man-132-pound-scrotum-dies-after-numerous-infections-heart-attacks-271370", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/17/wesley-warren.PNG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Wesley Warren Jr., scrotal lymphedema sufferer whose scrotum grew to 132 lbs., died in a Las Vegas hospital on Friday.", "title": "Man With 132-Pound Scrotum Dead At Age 49 [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/wesley-warren-jr-man-132-pound-scrotum-dies-after-numerous-infections-heart-attacks-271370", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/17/wesley-warren.PNG", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/17/wesley-warren.PNG"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-03-17T10:55:18-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-17T10:55:17-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Wesley Warren Jr., scrotal lymphedema sufferer whose scrotum grew to 132 lbs., died in a Las Vegas hospital on Friday."}, "article_summary": "\u201cHe was in the hospital for five and a half weeks,\u201d he said, speaking to the Las Vegas Review-Journal.\nWesely Warren Jr., the man who rose to international fame for his 132-pound scrotum, passed away at a Las Vegas hospital on Friday.\nRoommate Joey Hurtado told local media that, although no cause of death had officially been announced, the 49-year-old Warren had recently suffered two heart attacks.\n\u201cThere are a lot of shows about makeovers, but this is a real makeover,\u201d Gelman told local media last April.\nWith each passing month, his scrotum grew by 3 lbs., eventually forcing him to wear a hooded sweatshirt as pants."}
