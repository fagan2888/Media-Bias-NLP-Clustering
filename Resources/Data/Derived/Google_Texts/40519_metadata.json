Glitches in the current system locked users out of HealthCare.gov and exasperated the team brought in to salvage the site after its disastrous launch last fall left it barely usable for about two months.\n\nSome Wall Street Journal sources fear the ambitious revamp won\u2019t be finished by the time open season begins on Nov. 15, creating difficulties similar to those last fall.\n\nCMS spokesman Aaron Albright told Nextgov improvements were based on \u201cwhat is needed to successfully launch year two in mid-November.\u201d The agency\u2019s goals are to create a better marketplace for insurance plans and maximize enrollment.\n\nHealthCare.gov is the federal health care insurance marketplace serving the 36 states that opted not to create their own health plan exchanges.\n\nThe initial version of this story misidentified Amazon Web Services. It has been corrected.\n\n(Image via txking / Shutterstock.com)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Rebecca Carroll", "description": "Some fear the overhaul won\u2019t be done in time and could result in a failed open season.", "og": {"site_name": "Nextgov", "description": "Some fear the overhaul won\u2019t be done in time and could result in a failed open season.", "title": "HealthCare.gov Gets a Redesign for Obamacare Enrollment\u2019s 1st Birthday", "url": "http://www.nextgov.com/health/2014/06/healthcaregov-getting-redesign-obamacare-enrollments-1st-birthday/86020/", "image": "http://cdn.nextgov.com/media/img/upload/2014/06/06/060614healthcareNG.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://cdn.nextgov.com/media/img/upload/2014/06/06/060614healthcareNG/open-graph.jpg", "title": "HealthCare.gov Gets a Redesign for Obamacare Enrollment\u2019s 1st Birthday", "site": "@nextgov", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Some fear the overhaul won\u2019t be done in time and could result in a failed open season."}, "sailthru.date": "2014-06-06T20:36:53Z", "sailthru.images.full": "http://cdn.nextgov.com/media/img/upload/2014/06/06/060614healthcareNG.jpg", "sailthru.title": "HealthCare.gov Gets a Redesign for Obamacare Enrollment\u2019s 1st Birthday", "sailthru.tags": "open-season,healthcare.gov,obamacare,channel-nextgov->-health,type-story,length-short,site-nextgov", "fb": {"admins": 578600878}, "sailthru.images.thumb": "http://cdn.nextgov.com/media/img/upload/2014/06/06/060614healthcareNG/sailthru-thumbnail.jpg", "keywords": "open season, healthcare.gov, obamacare", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/Nextgov"}, "sailthru.description": "Some fear the overhaul won\u2019t be done in time and could result in a failed open season."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb056\"", "article_summary": "HealthCare.gov is the federal health care insurance marketplace serving the 36 states that opted not to create their own health plan exchanges.\nHealthCare.gov is getting a makeover ahead of open season in November, when residents of 36 states may use the site to acquire or change their health care plans.\nThe initial version of this story misidentified Amazon Web Services.\nThe redesigned site will also include a new, \u201cbuilt-from-scratch\u201d login system, Wired reported.\nThe insurance plan exchange for small businesses is on course to launch by Nov. 15, WSJ reported, after glitches last year forced delays in that part of the health care law."}
