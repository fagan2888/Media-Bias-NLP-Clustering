Politico\u2019s Ben Smith proclaimed the commentator to be \u201ca coherent, sophisticated and implacable critic of the president\u201d and a \u201ccentral conservative voice\u201d in the \u201cAge of Obama.\u201d New York Times mainstay David Brooks characterized him as \u201cthe most important conservative columnist right now.\u201d\n\nThe extraordinary thing about Krauthammer is his commitment to meeting almost every decision and pronouncement of the Obama administration with the same unerring, irked incredulity, night after night. If anything, the stamina required to make pithily negative assessments of virtually everything the President says and does deserves recognition. For many on the left, he is a kind of b\u00eate noire. As the novelist Alan Hollinghurst said of a character: \u2018There was something so irksome about him that he had a fascination: you longed for him to annoy you again.\u2019\n\nKrauthammer\u2019s approach is not realistic. Firstly, even during the Harding administration there would have been a few weeks, here and there, when even the most dogged critics would have shrugged their shoulders; and more importantly, this sober elder statesman of today\u2019s conservative commentariat has a record of erroneous predictions that stretches back to the turn of the millennium.\n\nWhen NATO, seeking to prevent another potential Balkan genocide, launched a bombing campaign against Serbia in 1999, Krauthammer argued that air strikes would be insufficient to force Milosevic out of Kosovo. Having denounced the move as mere wide-eyed liberal amateurism on the part of President Clinton, Krauthammer added a sarcastic note about Clinton playing golf in the midst of conflict (\u201cThe stresses of war, no doubt\u201d). He seems to have changed his mind on the propriety of such stress-relief measures around 2002 or so. Even after the Kosovo campaign proved successful, Krauthammer said that NATO involvement \u201cwould sever Kosovo from Serbian control and lead inevitably to an irredentist Kosovar state, unstable and unviable and forced to either join or take over pieces of neighboring countries.\u201d When an ethnic Albanian insurgency arose in Macedonia along its border with UN-administered Kosovo in 2001, he felt himself vindicated, announcing that \u201cthe Balkans are on the verge of another explosion,\u201d making several references to Vietnam, and characterizing the continued presence of NATO forces in the region as a \u201cquagmire.\u201d The violence ended within the year, having claimed less than 80 lives. Kosovo has since joined both the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank; Macedonia is preparing for membership in NATO and the European Union.\n\nKrauthammer was one of the leading boosters of the Iraq war. He argued in his February 1, 2002, Washington Post column that an invasion of Iraq would lead to the spread of democracy throughout the Middle East: \u201cOverthrowing neighbouring radical regimes shows the fragility of dictatorship, challenges the mullahs\u2019 mandate from heaven and thus encourages disaffected Iranians to rise. First, Afghanistan to the east. Next, Iraq to the west\u201d. As the Iraq war got into full swing, Krauthammer ridiculed a New York Times article proposing that coalition forces might have to contend with guerrilla fighters in Iraq. He initially hailed the Iraq conflict as \u201cthe Three Week War\u201d; and was sarcastically dismissive when those guerrillas whose existence he had found so improbable actually materialized.When U.S. reconstruction efforts were revealed to be amateurish, Krauthammer concluded a 2003 column with the suggestion that if, \u201cin a year or two we are able to leave behind a stable, friendly government, we will have succeeded. If not, we will have failed. And all the geniuses will be vindicated.\u201d\n\nAs the war dragged on, Krauthammer began a process of dissembling about the motivations for the Iraq war: \u201cOur objectives in Iraq were twofold and always simple: Depose Saddam Hussein and replace his murderous regime with a self-sustaining, democratic government,\u201d he said, now leaving the central argument made by the president and by the secretary of state at the U.N. about weapons of mass destruction out of his assessment. A review of Krauthammer\u2019s columns from 2002-2003 shows that he argued consistently that the risk of Saddam acquiring WMD and passing them on to terrorists was the reason for going to war, not the need to create democracy.\n\n4/19/02: \u201cSaddam survived, rearmed, defeated the inspections regime and is now back in the business of building weapons of mass destruction\u2026Time is running short. Saddam has weapons of mass destruction. He is working on nuclear weapons. And he has every incentive to pass them on to terrorists who will use them against us. Given the nature of Hussein\u2019s rule, destroying these weapons requires regime change.\u201d\n\n9/20/02: \u201cThe vice president, followed by the administration A Team and echoing the president, argues that we must remove from power an irrational dictator who has a history of aggression and mass murder, is driven by hatred of America and is developing weapons of mass destruction that could kill millions of Americans in a day. The Democrats respond with public skepticism, a raised eyebrow and the charge that the administration has yet to \u201cmake the case.\u201d The threat of mass death on a scale never before seen residing in the hands of an unstable madman is intolerable \u2013 and must be preempted.\u201d\n\nIn the wake of the invasion, Krauthammer\u2019s tone began to change: 6/13/03: \u201cThe inability to find the weapons is indeed troubling, but only because it means that the weapons remain unaccounted for and might be in the wrong hands. The idea that our inability to thus far find the weapons proves that the threat was phony and hyped is simply false.\u201d Later, when the surge was proposed, Krauthammer came out against the idea, explaining in a 2007 column that it \u201cwill fail\u201d due to the perfidy and incompetence of the Maliki government. He eventually deemed it a success and criticized those who predicted that it would be a failure. Krauthammer also claimed that President Bush was able to present Barack Obama with a war virtually won and that all Obama had to do was seal the deal.\n\nRegarding Afghanistan, he would initially declare it \u201can astonishing success\u201d and Karzai a \u201cdeeply respected democrat.\u201d As the Afghanistan war dragged on into President Obama\u2019s administration, Krauthammer was asked if the president would end up giving General McChrystal the troops he wanted, or would change the war strategy, Krauthammer replied, \u201cI think he doesn\u2019t and McChrystal resigns.\u201d In reality, Obama did, and McChrystal didn\u2019t.\n\nThus it is that this most respected of conservative commentators may be the only pundit in the country to have been wrong about every major U.S. foreign policy question of the last decade and a half. When it came to early predictions about the 2008 race, Krauthammer suggested that should Obama run, \u201che will not win.\u201d In the meantime, he said, the White House would probably go to a Republican, \u201csay, 9/11 veteran Rudy Giuliani.\u201d Krauthammer also warned that the \u201creflexive anti-war sentiments\u201d of the left \u201cwill prove disastrous for the Democrats in the long run \u2013 the long run beginning as early as November \u201808.\u201d In the long run, of course, Democrats won.\n\nDuring Obama\u2019s first term as president, Krauthammer, On the PBS show Inside Washington, predicted that the U.S. Supreme Court would overturn the individual mandate provision of the Affordable Care Act: \u201cI think the way it works is in the short run it will be a devastating defeat for the president, because his singular achievement will be shown by the Court to be unconstitutional\u201d. Krauthammer took a phone call from Donald Trump in April of 2011 and somehow came away with the impression that Trump was going to make a genuine run for the White House. Krauthammer\u2019s reasoning was this: \u201cBut as a person, I thought more highly of him \u2026 because of the gracious way and the calm and courteous way he discussed the issues.\u201d\n\nIn the lead up to the 2012 election, Krauthammer speculated, \u201cThe fact is I think Romney does win in November, and the reason is it\u2019s a pretty static race now, but it\u2019s not going to be static forever, and the dynamic is the economy is weakening\u2026\u201d On the eve of the election he predicted: \u201cRomney, very close. But he\u2019ll win the popular by I think about half a point, Electoral College probably a very narrow margin.\u201d And for good measure he said: \u201cI have every confidence he\u2019s going to win in Florida, in North Carolina and Virginia\u201d.\n\nAfter Obama handily won the election, Krauthammer complained darkly about the President asserting himself in the new term. \u201cThis is entirely about politics. It\u2019s phase two of the 2012 campaign. The election returned him to office. The fiscal cliff negotiations are designed to break the Republican opposition and grant him political supremacy, something he thinks he earned with his landslide 2.8-point victory margin on Election Day.\u201d Krauthammer\u2019s sneering reference to Obama\u2019s \u201clandslide\u201d overlooks the fact it was a more substantial win than either of George W. Bush\u2019s, and Krauthammer never insisted that Bush practice restraint because of his narrow wins. Instead, he remarked of George W. Bush\u2019s re-election: \u201cThe endorsement was resounding. First, his Electoral College victory was solid. He won comfortably. Second, there was the popular vote\u2026If you have already won the electoral vote, it is okay to talk about the popular vote as a kind of adjunct legitimizer. And a 3.5 million vote margin is a serious majority. Knowing he will never again run for office, he is going to attempt several large things, most notably reforming Social Security\u2026\u201d Obama\u2019s near-5-million-vote margin was cause for sneering, and a reason why he shouldn\u2019t push for the things he said he wanted to do during the campaign. Whereas George W. Bush\u2019s 3.5-million-vote margin was \u201ca serious majority\u201d, giving him license to do things he never mentioned during the campaign, like try to privatize Social Security.\n\nWhen the I.R.S issue surfaced, Krauthammer weighed in with his familiar pattern of melodramatic portent dressed in pithy prognostication: \u201cThe fact is you have a committee headed by a Democrat and a Democratic senate who is leading all this who yesterday submitted over 40 questions about the IRS scandal, and said, \u2018I have a suspicion there is a lot here we don\u2019t know\u2019. This thing is going to go on and it could be fatal.\u201d\n\nWhen The Affordable Care Act was struggling early on, it was Krauthammer\u2019s view that the prospect of Obamacare self-destructing and setting American Liberalism back at least a decade, \u201cis more than likely.\u201d Five months later, enrollments surpassed all expectations.\n\nMost recently, Krauthammer castigated the President over the Ukraine situation: \u2018The E.U dithers while Obama slumbers\u2019. Krauthammer advocated \u2018a serious loan/aid package, say, replacing Moscow\u2019s $15 billion\u2019, and urgent delivery of weapons in case the Russians advanced into Ukraine \u2018as far as Kiev\u2019. After this Krauthammerian reprise of hot-headed hawkishness in the guise of sober realpolitik, the Ukrainians had an election, voted in a strong new leader who inked a secure and expansive trade deal with Europe, and is now promising to crack down on the separatist elements in the East, without the U.S having to take any of the aforementioned \u2018urgent\u2019 actions.\n\nCharles Krauthammer is an intelligent, Pulitzer Prize winning contributor to civic discourse, but in cleaving too closely to the ideological bent of the network he works for, in the inherently sensationalist, demagogic cable-news sphere, he has squandered his potential to be genuinely above the fray in public affairs. Nevertheless, many on the right perceive him to be preternaturally authoritative, and give a lot of credence to his insights. As Nate Silver has said: \u201cThe thing that people associate with expertise, authoritativeness, kind of with a capital \u2018A,\u2019 don\u2019t correlate very well with who\u2019s actually good at making predictions.\u201d\n\nNicholas Sheppard edits the Sheppard Post, where this essay originally appeared.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "www.counterpunch.org", "description": "A History of Terrible Predictions and Ludicrous Assessments", "title": "Krauthammer Syndrome", "url": "http://www.counterpunch.org/2014/07/18/krauthammer-syndrome/", "image": "http://i1.wp.com/www.counterpunch.org/wp-content/dropzone/2015/06/OGFB4.png", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-18T11:22:38+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-30T16:22:46+00:00"}, "description": "A History of Terrible Predictions and Ludicrous Assessments", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "robots": "noodp, noydir"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca1d2\"", "article_summary": "After Obama handily won the election, Krauthammer complained darkly about the President asserting himself in the new term.\nKrauthammer was one of the leading boosters of the Iraq war.\nAs the Iraq war got into full swing, Krauthammer ridiculed a New York Times article proposing that coalition forces might have to contend with guerrilla fighters in Iraq.\nMost recently, Krauthammer castigated the President over the Ukraine situation: \u2018The E.U dithers while Obama slumbers\u2019.\nbyCharles Krauthammer, who can be seen most nights on Fox\u2019s Special Report with Bret Bair, qualifies as one of the most significant of the Obama administration\u2019s opponents."}
