Here are a few tips from Alfonso:\n\nFind your cause. Alfonso says social objectives are unique to each individual, making investment choices differ.\n\n\u201cAdvisors can help to refine and translate their objectives on the social side into their geographic and industry preferences,\u201d she says. \u201cWe also create a risk profile with a sliding scale, where you are either a financial first investor or a social first investor. That dictates your expectations.\u201d\n\nExamples of social investments include basic resources, sanitation, water purification, agriculture, sustainable forestry, charter schools and renewable energy, she says. Microfinance loans for businesses in emerging markets are another popular option for impact investors, she adds.\n\nPractice due diligence. Filter your options, and decide where and how you want to invest, Alfonso suggests.\n\n\u201cThe common myth is that an impact investment needs to be something found in a foreign market,\u201d she says. \u201cBut you can identify a charter school [to invest in] in America. Newark [New Jersey] and Detroit are two popular options for investors.\u201d\n\nAssess risks. Just like any other investment, there are risks associated with impact investing.\n\n\u201cThere is often a lack of liquidity on the supply-and-demand side,\u201d Alfonso says. \u201cThere is also access to capital and volatility with currencies. And a big one is fees\u2014there are introductory costs and due diligence fees.\u201d\n\nPick an investment type. Once you have taken the above steps, it\u2019s time to invest.\n\nAlfonso says there are traditional loan investments, community notes, grants and more. Find the cause and type of investment that works best with your profile and start impacting change. Incorporating commonly used reporting standards such as IRIS (impact reporting and investment standards) can also provide investors with a benchmark to guide their impact investment decisions.\n\n\u201cCatalyzing social change used to rely on the government and non-governmental organizations,\u201d she says. \u201cImpact investing is allowing private investors to catalyze social change through their own investments.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.modified": "2016-01-07 11:14:12 EST", "dcterms.abstract": "Social impact investing is a growing market, and allows private investors to catalyze change in a major way.
