Republicans currently control 60 of America\u2019s 99 state assemblies or senates, and have monopolies on power in 36 states\u2014the most since the 1950s.\n\nBut a closer look reveals that 2014 is not going to be a slam-dunk for the GOP in state legislatures. Instead, Democrats stand a good chance of breaking the Republican grip on power in five states\u2014Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Iowa, Arkansas, New Hampshire\u2014while maintaining current partisan divisions in others. That\u2019s nowhere close to reversing 2010\u2019s Republican wave, but it\u2019s not merely holding the line, either.\n\n\n\n\u201cI think there are a lot of seats in play and a lot of chambers in play on both sides,\u201d said Kurt Fritts, Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee national political director. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is a year where Democrats are necessarily on the defensive. I know we have a lot of offensive opportunities out there.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn top of the five states where Democrats stand a good chance of winning state senate or house majority, Fritts said Democrats could make New Hampshire and Maine fully blue, where Democrats control the legislature and governor\u2019s mansion. That scenario was not in the Times\u2019 analysis. He also predicted that there will be voter backlash in some states where Tea Partiers won since 2010\u2014North Carolina, Georgia and Michigan\u2014but those gains likely would not add up to new Democratic majorities.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe interesting thing about this cycle is there is no overwhelming national narrative,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat that means is these races are going to be fought based upon what\u2019s going on in these states, based against what the electoral landscape is at the top of the ticket in each of these states, and based upon the strength of individual candidates. That\u2019s partly why we feel very confident in states like Pennsylvania, where there\u2019s a very unpopular Republican governor at the top of the ticket. That bodes very well for us.\u201d\n\n\n\nJill Bader, a spokeswomen for Fritts\u2019 counterpart, the Republican Legislative Campaign Committee, agreed that states such as Arkansas, Iowa, Wisconsin and Michigan would be electoral battlegrounds, but she also thought Democrats were far being too optimistic.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat we are seeing is overwhelming anti-Obama sentiment, even in purple states,\u201d she said Tuesday. \u201cIf the Democrats think they will be winning, they are in fantasy land. We will do better than protect our majorities.\u201d\n\n\n\nThis week, the RLCC was meeting in Colorado, where Bader said the party was targeting 14 key state house and senate races across the country. Its \u201c2014 Path to Victory\u201d memo listed state races in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Hawaii, Michigan, Montana, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Washington and West Virginia. \u201cThese are just 14 great candidates, they are candidates in targeted seats that, in many instances, could flip legislative control to Republicans,\u201d their forecast said. In California, electing one state senator could break a Democratic super majority in that chamber, the memo said. In Colorado and Nevada, Republicans need one additional seat to flip control.\n\n\n\n\u201cObama has dismal job approval numbers,\u201d Bader said. \u201cWhen the president has those kinds of numbers, we gain seats\u2014not hold seats.\u201d\n\n\n\nMany mainstream media pundits agree with Bader\u2019s calculus. The Times said the likely GOP gains would be \u201ctaking advantage of President Obama\u2019s persistent unpopularity, anxiety about the economy, and a history of anemic turnout among Democrats in non-presidential election years.\u201d\n\n\n\nBader and Fritts are both working to hype their parties' prospects. But compared to the last congressional midterm election in 2010, Democrats are trying harder to turn out their base this year. Arkansas is a good illustration. It has active campaigns for governor and U.S. senator, the top of the ticket. At the state legislative level, Democrats are likely to win the house, the Times said, while Republicans are likely to win the senate.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe president didn\u2019t compete for Arkansas in 2012,\u201d Fritts said. \u201cThere was not a reason for Democrats to come out and vote. This year there is, because they have a very high-profile governor\u2019s race and U.S. Senate race. It matches up well for us, in terms of the opportunity there in the legislature.\u201d\n\n\n\nFritts detailed other races with factors that could help Democrats. In New York state, for example, there have been a handful of so-called independent Democrats in the senate who often vote with Republicans. This fall, however, it\u2019s likely that seats vacated by retiring Republicans will be won by Democrats, ending that problem. He also took issue with the Times\u2019 projection that Oregon\u2019s senate would fall into Republican hands.\n\n\n\nFritts also questioned the GOP strategy of running against Obama as a key theme.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not even talking about repealing Obamacare anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cI think they assumed they would run against this president and do it wrapped around Obamacare. They backed away from that across the board, because they realized their message of kicking people off of health insurance is not really the right message to take.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn the Republican side, Bader said Democrats don\u2019t fully understand what Republicans, such as Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and his legislative allies, have achieved for their base. Walker ended a budget deficit and saw 100,000 jobs created under his watch, she said, citing examples that Democrats obviously interpret very differently.\n\n\n\n\u201cI think Republicans get that government is not the answer to the problems that are facing their constituencies,\u201d Bader said, when asked what Democrats do not understand about the GOP. \u201cWhen you get government out of the way, and get people off of 'entitlement' programs and get them working, that\u2019s the right way to go. It\u2019s not about growing government, it\u2019s about growing jobs in the private sector. A dependence on government is not what Republicans focus on.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhat this all means is that Democrats\u2014especially those running at the state level\u2014do not all face electoral doomsday this fall. If anything, it appears that Democrats will take one chamber in several states with some of the most draconian Republican governors. That outcome would force Republicans to negotiate instead of pushing through an ideological agenda, because states, unlike Congress, tend to govern.\n\n\n\nAs Labor Day approaches and the final stretches of the 2014 election come into view, don\u2019t believe that this fall\u2019s electoral outcome is a foregone conclusion. In many states, the biggest issues and most pressing concerns have nothing to do with Obama.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Republicans always want to nationalize the election\u2014it makes it easier for them,\u201d Fritts said. \u201cIt is just not going to be that kind of election this year.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Despite all the doomsday talk, there's plenty of evidence to the contrary.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Alternet", "description": "Despite all the doomsday talk, there's plenty of evidence to the contrary.", "title": "Why 2014 Won't Be Anything Like a Blowout Election for Republicans in State Elections", "url": "http://www.alternet.org/election-2014/why-2014-wont-be-anything-blowout-election-republicans-state-elections", "image": "http://www.alternet.org/files/story_images/saragesler_or.jpg", "type": "article"}, "dc": {"title": "Why 2014 Won&#039;t Be Anything Like a Blowout Election for Republicans in State Elections"}, "fb": {"page_id": 17108852506, "pages": 17108852506}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-12T23:45:00"}, "google-site-verification": "-yUzdOYz6i2iShII0x_PYzsvnhQUG2f751funoPlCNM", "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "article_summary": "Why 2014 Won't Be Anything Like a Blowout Election for Republicans in State ElectionsDemocrat Sara Gesler is a state senate candidate in Oregon.\nAt the state legislative level, Democrats are likely to win the house, the Times said, while Republicans are likely to win the senate.\nThe New York Times this week reported that the GOP is likely to emerge with new majorities in perhaps nine state legislative chambers.\nIn New York state, for example, there have been a handful of so-called independent Democrats in the senate who often vote with Republicans.\nRepublicans currently control 60 of America\u2019s 99 state assemblies or senates, and have monopolies on power in 36 states\u2014the most since the 1950s."}
