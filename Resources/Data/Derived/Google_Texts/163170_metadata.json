Here\u2019s more from the statement the organization released Thursday afternoon:\n\n\u2018Today, we ask that our legislators focus their energy on women\u2019s health, not politics. NARAL Pro-Choice North Carolina\u2019s top priority is to protect comprehensive reproductive healthcare access. While 7 in 10 Americans believe in protecting a woman\u2019s fundamental rights, the majority of North Carolina counties do not have access to an abortion provider. SB 604 will only further restrict access to comprehensive reproductive healthcare. NARAL Pro-Choice North Carolina agrees that women should receive reproductive healthcare in the safest possible environment, and that doctors should be free to provide the best medical care for every patient\u2019s individual needs. SB 604 will make it more difficult for patients to receive the quality care they deserve. On the surface these regulations may seem mundane, but in reality, their purpose is to block women\u2019s access to abortion. We agree with previous statements made by legislative leaders that the General Assembly should not be practicing medicine.\u2019\n\nTo read Senate Bill 604 in its entirety, click here.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "NARAL Pro-Choice North Carolina said SB 604 was nothing more than anti-choice politics.\nNARAL Pro-Choice North Carolina\u2019s top priority is to protect comprehensive reproductive healthcare access.\nSB 604 will only further restrict access to comprehensive reproductive healthcare.\nSB 604 will make it more difficult for patients to receive the quality care they deserve.\nWhile 7 in 10 Americans believe in protecting a woman\u2019s fundamental rights, the majority of North Carolina counties do not have access to an abortion provider."}
