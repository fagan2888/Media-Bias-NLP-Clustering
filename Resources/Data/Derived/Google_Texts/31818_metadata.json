The Times identifies him as \u201ca Wall Street executive.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s like describing the Son of Sam as a New York City resident.\n\nIf you were to create a living embodiment of cronyism and everything wrong with the political-financial complex that\u2019s bled our economy dry, that creature would be Steven Rattner.\n\nThe appropriately named Rattner paid over $10 million in fines for bribing public officials to steer New York state pension funds to his Wall Street firm. Unlike some of his less-connected accomplices in the scheme, Rattner managed to escape perjury charges, prison time and lifetime exile from the financial industry only because Andrew Cuomo, then state attorney general, needed Rattner\u2019s Wall Street friends when he became governor.\n\nIt\u2019s touching that the New York Times and MSNBC offers this repeat offender rehabilitation services even as lessers struggle to get a barber\u2019s license.\n\nRattner\u2019s criminal career didn\u2019t end on Wall Street. Obama put him in charge of the GM bailout despite his criminal record and his having no experience in manufacturing. In that capacity, Rattner robbed thousands of engineers of the retirement benefits they were promised while ensuring politically connected unions were made whole. And Rattner saw to it that after the American taxpayers bailed out General Motors, GM would repay the favor by closing American plants and moving its car-making operations to China.\n\nThat gets us to the substance of his essay.\n\nRattner says Republicans \u201ccreated the anger that lifted [Trump\u2019s] candidacy by years of systematically and effectively preventing passage of legislation that might have ameliorated the tough economic state of Mr. Trump\u2019s core voters,\u201d whom he describes as \u201cdisproportionately white, middle-aged, working-class men without college educations, a group whose fortunes have flagged as globalization and new technology have rendered millions of jobs obsolete and cut into the wages of many more.\u201d\n\nThis is rich. If you want to \u201cameliorate the tough economic state of Mr. Trump\u2019s core voters,\u201d you could start by sending Rattner and his fellow parasites to Guantanamo.\n\nDon\u2019t be misled by Rattner\u2019s display of faux empathy for blue collar America. He isn\u2019t slamming Republicans for supporting the corporatist managed-trade deals like NAFTA and Obamatrade that strip America of manufacturing and jobs. If he did, he\u2019d have to slam himself, his fellow Democrats and his private equity cronies who write the deals at the U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s office while on leave of absence from Wall Street and Bain Capital.\n\nRattner and Obama (along with top Republicans) support the job-killing trade deals. His gripe is that the GOP hasn\u2019t signed on to the fake-work schemes Obama plans for those he\u2019s robbed of private sector jobs.\n\nRattner\u2019s prescription for the lousy economy: \u201cExtended unemployment benefits for the long-term unemployed, wage insurance, a higher minimum wage and the like.\u201d In short, have the government make sure everyone gets paid.\n\nThey used to tell us better-paying high-tech jobs in the new information economy would replace those manufacturing jobs sent to Mexico and China. Not anymore. Now we\u2019re told we should get \u201cwage insurance\u201d to help us survive on crappy-paying jobs.\n\nWage insurance is the newest euphemism for making everyone dependent on a government handout. Under this scheme, someone whose job is sent overseas and ends up in a lower-paid job (as most people do) would receive half of the lost wages for two years, up to $10,000. This is in Obama\u2019s latest budget, and the Obamatrade supporters are hot on it. It\u2019s amazing the guys peddling this drivel are considered financial wizards.\n\nWe\u2019re supposed to believe wage insurance will fulfill that self-respecting \u201cwhite, middle-aged, working-class man\u201d?\n\nWestern civilization was founded on precepts immortalized in the Bible, among them, Man shall earn his daily bread by the sweat of his brow, and Man does not live on bread alone.\n\nOnce upon a time in America, parents would teach their kids, \u201cHave faith in G-d, find your calling, pursue it with all your heart, all your soul and all your might, and you will have a family you love and provide for when you grow up.\u201d\n\nAccording to Rattner and his ilk, Man does live by bread alone, and the government will provide it.\n\nIn the America they envision, parents will tell their children, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, the government will give you a check whether you have a job or not.\u201d\n\nNow we can finally see the future the bipartisan elite has planned for what was once known as the Land of the Free and the Home of the Brave.\n\nMedia wishing to interview Curtis Ellis, please contact media@wnd.com.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"url": "http://www.wnd.com/2016/04/washingtons-plan-welfare-for-all/", "site_name": "WND", "type": "article", "description": "Leave it to the New York Times to provide what passes for wisdom among the elitists you find in Manhattan and Georgetown salons when they\u2019re not at their offices telling us what to do or on TV telling us what to think.
