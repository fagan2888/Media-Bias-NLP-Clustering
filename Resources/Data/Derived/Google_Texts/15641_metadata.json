This is the third consecutive year in which Catherine\u2019s Health Center has received a grant from the AstraZeneca HealthCare Foundation, totaling $486,253.\n\nHeart Smart Connections aims to improve the cardiovascular health of 2,000 low-income community residents by assisting with accessing services, including health insurance via the Affordable Care Act. The program builds on the successful Live Heart Smart program, which identifies risk factors and uses targeted interventions to encourage and support healthy lifestyle choices.\n\n\u201cOur patients desperately need access to heart health information and care. Many of them simply assume that heart disease runs in their family and they\u2019re resigned to living with it or dying of it,\u201d said Karen Kaashoek, executive director of Catherine\u2019s Health Center. \u201cWhen they know their risk factors, patients often work to reduce their risk; we\u2019ve seen reduced smoking, increased exercise and 276 participants have lost 2,068 pounds. The Foundation\u2019s grant helps us do that.\u201d\n\nAs a result of previous funding from the AstraZeneca HealthCare Foundation, nearly 1,000 of the 1,247 participants from the first grant year returned for an annual rescreening, an 80 percent retention rate. In addition, nearly 1,000 new participants were tracked during the second grant year. Nearly 60 percent of new participants decreased their systolic blood pressure by an average of 15 points and nearly 45 percent reduced their Body Mass Index (BMI) by an average of 1.2 points. For those new participants with elevated initial total cholesterol (232 participants), more than 60 percent reduced their total cholesterol by an average of 34 points.\n\n\u201cCardiovascular disease is a major burden in our communities, and it can be difficult for people to access care or information about their cardiovascular risks,\u201d said Timothy J. Gardner, MD, AstraZeneca HealthCare Foundation trustee. \u201cCatherine\u2019s Health Center is addressing this through an innovative program to help community members improve their heart health.\u201d\n\nThe Connections for Cardiovascular HealthSM program annually awards grants to U.S.-based nonprofit organizations across the country. More than $2.6 million in grants to 13 organizations will be announced this year. More than $17 million in grants have been awarded through the program since its inception in 2010. In 2015, the Connections for Cardiovascular HealthSM program will award grants from $150,000 to $180,000.\n\nOrganizations can learn more and apply online for a Connections for Cardiovascular HealthSM grant at www.astrazeneca-us.com/foundation. Applications must be submitted online no later than 5 p.m. EST on Feb. 26, 2015.\n\nAbout Catherine\u2019s Health Center\n\nEstablished in 1996, Catherine\u2019s Health Center is a 501(c)(3) safety net medical clinic, providing services for more than 6,000 patient visits annually.
