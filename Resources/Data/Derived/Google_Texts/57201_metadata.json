And Mayor Michael Nutter said the partnership with Enroll America will train city staffers so they know their stuff.\n\n\"While there certainly have been some challenges at the beginning, things are moving along. Folks are signing up,\" Nutter said. \"They are certainly getting the information they need.\"\n\nThere are 1.3 million Pennsylvanians without health insurance and 210,000 Philadelphians without coverage.\n\n\"What it's really about is greater access. There's another voice out here in another nonpartisan, nonprofit organization, just sharing information, helping people get signed up for health care,\" said Nutter.\n\nPeople have heard about the problems with Healthcare.gov, but might not know what's available, said Bill England, state director of Enroll America.\n\n\"Generally what we hear is people don't know if they are eligible and they don't know how the program works, so we start talking about what the eligibility looks like,\" he said. \"We start talking about the benefits that are available.\n\n\"It's a rich insurance package. We start talking about the fact that the pre-existing condition clause goes away,\" England added. \"These are all big things people want to know.\"\n\nEnroll America has started working with staffers across several city departments.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The City of Philadelphia is partnering with Enroll America a nonpartisan nonprofit to help educate consumers about how to sign up for insurance through the health exchange Philadelphia officials", "title": "Philly enlists nonprofit, Enroll America, to help consumers sign up for health insurance", "og": {"image": "http://www.newsworks.org/nw_logo_fb.png", "site_name": "Newsworks.org", "description": "The City of Philadelphia is partnering with Enroll America, a nonpartisan nonprofit, to help educate consumers about how to sign up for insurance through the health exchange."}, "twitter": {"description": "The City of Philadelphia is partnering with Enroll America, a nonpartisan nonprofit, to help educate consumers about how to sign up for insurance through the health exchange.", "title": "Philly enlists nonprofit, Enroll America, to help consumers sign up for health insurance", "image": "http://www.newsworks.org/images/stories/flexicontent/m_nhnutterandenroll-5x1200.jpg", "creator": "@", "site": "@NewsWorksWHYY", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffc40d", "robots": "index, follow", "DC.date.issued": "2013-11-26", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"page_id": 115829381793481}, "url": "http://www.newsworks.org/index.php/local/healthscience/62319-philly-joins-with-nonprofit-in-getting-out-the-word-on-health-insurance", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "author": "Sarah Whites-Koditschek", "keywords": "about, people, health, america, enroll, there, nutter, insurance, talking, start, england, things, without, staffers, information, philadelphia, certainly, available, another, nonpartisan", "google-site-verification": "zlKVThgI_7CsCilHyAeJraRojXxR5nL5CZqBEZJMJNw", "st": {"image": "http://www.newsworks.org/images/stories/flexicontent/m_nhnutterandenroll-5x1200.jpg"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "msapplication-TileImage": "/mstile-144x144.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd090\"", "article_summary": "The City of Philadelphia is partnering with Enroll America, a nonpartisan nonprofit, to help educate consumers about how to sign up for insurance through the health exchange.\nAnd Mayor Michael Nutter said the partnership with Enroll America will train city staffers so they know their stuff.\nThere are 1.3 million Pennsylvanians without health insurance and 210,000 Philadelphians without coverage.\nPeople have heard about the problems with Healthcare.gov, but might not know what's available, said Bill England, state director of Enroll America.\nWe start talking about the fact that the pre-existing condition clause goes away,\" England added."}
