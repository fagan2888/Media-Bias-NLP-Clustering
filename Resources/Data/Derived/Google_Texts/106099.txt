Illinois Democratic governor Pat Quinn is one of the most unpopular governors in the country, so much so that he couldn’t even get gratuitous applause at a Little League team’s rally. Quinn made the embarrassingly awkward appearance at a celebration for U.S. Little League Champions Jackie Robinson West.

“Everybody say, ‘Hey Pat!’ Make some noise!” the host told the crowd before welcoming Quinn. The crowd was almost dead silent as Quinn took the mic.

The governor greeted the crowd asked them to join him in chanting the team’s initials — “J-R-W!” — to no avail.
