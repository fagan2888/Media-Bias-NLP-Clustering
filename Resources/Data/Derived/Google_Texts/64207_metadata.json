The ad seeks to target young women, specifically, by promoting their relationships with their pets, who want their owners to get covered.\n\nEnroll America\u2019s video opens with a sweet beat and a cat encouraging its owner to take care of him or herself. A pair of parrots and some adorable dogs then join in, spreading the joint message, \u201cwe want you to get health insurance.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo listen to me, / A talking pug, you see, / If you get health insurance / Preventive care is now free,\u201d a pug raps to the camera as the ad continues.\n\nPosted to YouTube on Tuesday, Enroll America President Anne Filipic told USA Today featuring pets in the promotion helps to \u201cbreak through the clutter.\u201d According to Filipic, more than half of female pet owners would risk their lives for their animals, hence the rapping pug and crooning cats.\n\nBut Enroll America\u2019s president concedes that reaching the American people \u2014 and \u201cYoung Invincibles,\u201d in particular \u2014 hasn\u2019t been easy.\n\n\u201cThere have been challenges in getting messages out,\u201d Filipic said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t have the facts they need to know.\u201d\n\nWhether or not singing birds, bulldogs and cats remedy those issues remains to be seen.\n\nAs of early January, only 24 percent of those who selected a plan through Obamacare\u2019s health insurance marketplace were between the ages of 18 and 34, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. The Obama administration set a target of 40 percent by March 31, the end of the open enrollment period. But the success of President Barack Obama\u2019s signature healthcare law relies substantially on young people\u2019s participation. If less than 2.7 million 18- to 34-year-olds fail to enroll in Obamacare, the law faces falling into a death spiral, which rises the cost of premiums for all in the pool.\n\nCheck out Enroll America\u2019s new ad below.
