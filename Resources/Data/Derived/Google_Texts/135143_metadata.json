That was the message from executives at the Charlotte Chamber\u2019s annual economic outlook conference Monday.\n\nSure, caution-flag racing is kind of meh to watch. But that\u2019s about where our economy is right now, said Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan.\n\n\u201cThe economy continues to make progress and move forward, but it hasn't taken off yet,\u201d he said.\n\nThe labor market is a good example. Here\u2019s the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Jeff Lacker:\n\n\u201cOver the last four years, employment growth has been just 1.0 percent per year,\u201d Lacker said. \u201cAn imminent acceleration in employment doesn't seem likely to me.\u201d\n\nThat means the unemployment rate will keep dropping down bit by bit. It\u2019s eight percent in North Carolina.\n\nThe manufacturing industry is slowly improving, too. Chris Kearney is the CEO of global manufacturing firm SPX.\n\n\u201cWe've seen ourselves sort of bounce off the bottom - nowhere near where we were three years ago, five years ago - but encouraging nonetheless,\u201d Kearney said.\n\nAnd in retail?\n\n\u201cWe expect next year to be a little bit better than this year,\u201d said Belk CEO Tim Belk. He said the retail industry is coming off a very strong Thanksgiving weekend.\n\nSo what\u2019s holding the economy back? Here\u2019s Duke Energy Executive Vice President Lloyd Yates.\n\n\u201cThe uncertainty in Washington is keeping a lot of us hedging our bets,\u201d Yates said.\n\nAnd the Affordable Care Act is partly to blame, said Susan DeVore, CEO of Premier Healthcare Alliance.\n\n\u201cWell, the rollout of the exchanges has made health care systems a lot more cautious,\u201d she said.\n\nDeVore said some businesses are slowing hiring until they see how the law plays out.\n\nWells Fargo Senior Executive Vice President David Carroll said Congressional bickering isn\u2019t helping, either.\n\n\u201cWhether it's the debt ceiling debate, government shutdown, sequestration, health care - all of those things make investors very timid, more conservative, and operate with a much shorter time horizon,\u201d he said.\n\nCarroll also brought up political discord closer to home. He mentioned the fight over control of the Charlotte airport between city officials and state lawmakers as a cautionary tale.\n\n\u201cI just hope the recent situation with the airport doesn't typify the way local government, the state and the county all move forward,\u201d he said. \u201cThat's not our history.\u201d\n\nAnd that's not going to help the economy, he said.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Local News", "description": "The economy in Charlotte and North Carolina as a whole next year will be like a NASCAR race under a caution flag \u2013 it\u2019ll move forward, but not too fast.", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://wfae.org/post/executives-give-lukewarm-predictions-2014-nc-economy", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wfae/files/styles/medium/public/201312/ChamberEconomicConference.JPG", "type": "article", "description": "The economy in Charlotte and North Carolina as a whole next year will be like a NASCAR race under a caution flag \u2013 it\u2019ll move forward, but not too fast.", "title": "Executives Give Lukewarm Predictions For 2014 NC Economy"}, "story_id": 249951910, "twitter": {"site": "@WFAE", "card": "summary", "creator": "@WFAE"}, "author": "Michael Tomsic", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Executives Give Lukewarm Predictions For 2014 NC Economy"}, "nid": 40808, "datePublished": "2013-12-10", "keywords": "Charlotte Chamber of Commerce, NC Economy, Brian Moynihan, David Carroll, Belk, Duke Energy, Business", "wordCount": 477, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Wells Fargo Senior Executive Vice President David Carroll said Congressional bickering isn\u2019t helping, either.\n\u201cAn imminent acceleration in employment doesn't seem likely to me.\u201dThat means the unemployment rate will keep dropping down bit by bit.\nHere\u2019s Duke Energy Executive Vice President Lloyd Yates.\nBut that\u2019s about where our economy is right now, said Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan.\n\u201cThe economy continues to make progress and move forward, but it hasn't taken off yet,\u201d he said."}
