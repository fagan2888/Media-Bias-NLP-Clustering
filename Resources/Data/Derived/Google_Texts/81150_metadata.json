It was up to Dunnigan as the House majority leader to come up with an alternative to the Healthy Utah plan after criticizing it so thoroughly before and during the legislative session.\n\nThe result was HB 446 was filed on the day before its presentation to the House committee. Dunnigan\u2019s legislation has been come to be known as \u201cUtah Cares\u201d and is a scaled down Healthy Utah.\n\nOne of the real differences between the two Medicaid expansion plans is that Utah Cares relies upon Primary Care Networks (PCN\u2019s) for economic efficiency. Dunnigan and his colleagues did not want the state of Utah to be reliant on reimbursement from the federal government that ceases in two years. That kind of efficiency prompts critics to emphasize that Utah Care\u2019s PCNs would allow a patient to be diagnosed with a life-threatening illness but would not cover in-patient hospitalization for the same illness. That, they say, could lead to more medical bankruptcies and testimony to that end was heard on Wednesday.\n\nDunnigan characterized his bill as less than desirable in some ways, he used an automobile analogy, calling it a \u201cYugo,\u201d He added that his bill was one that \u201cstill gets you where you need to go.\u201d\n\nBy the same 9-4 vote on party lines, each bill received the votes that made one survive the House Business and Labor Committee for further House debate while the other now is finished with the legislative branch effort. Shiozawa\u2019s Healthy Utah 2.0 was rejected in favor of Dunnigan\u2019s Utah Cares bill which will advance to the floor of the House and then need Senate consideration as well.\n\nDr. David Patton, who oversaw the Healthy Utah plan along with Shiozawa and who spent a serious amount of time negotiating with the White House and Health and the Human Services Secretary (two of them), testified that there were sufficient commonalities between the two bills and that his Department of Health could still make the effort toward expanding Medicaid work. The PCN lack-of-hospitalization aspect was one that he didn\u2019t readily know how to address at the close of the hearing. After the fateful committee action, the Governor\u2019s press secretary, Marty Carpenter, released a statement saying only that, \u201cThe governor looks forward to working with the Legislature on a solution that best protects the interests of the Utah taxpayer and provides necessary coverage for Utahns in need.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "generator": "WordPress 4.2.8"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde6eb\"", "article_summary": "Dunnigan\u2019s legislation has been come to be known as \u201cUtah Cares\u201d and is a scaled down Healthy Utah.\nShiozawa\u2019s Healthy Utah 2.0 was rejected in favor of Dunnigan\u2019s Utah Cares bill which will advance to the floor of the House and then need Senate consideration as well.\nThe result was HB 446 was filed on the day before its presentation to the House committee.\nIt was up to Dunnigan as the House majority leader to come up with an alternative to the Healthy Utah plan after criticizing it so thoroughly before and during the legislative session.\nOne of the real differences between the two Medicaid expansion plans is that Utah Cares relies upon Primary Care Networks (PCN\u2019s) for economic efficiency."}
