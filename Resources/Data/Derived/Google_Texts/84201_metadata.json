She went from full time, to medical leave and then to being unemployed. She has been waiting to see if she is able to draw unemployment while she looks for a job. So, she is currently earning no income and my income is not enough to keep us afloat. She currently has no health insurance as her COBRA was way too much to afford. We are left wondering what to do. Any ideas???? Adding her to my work insurance is also way too much. Thanks for any help you can give us.\u201d\n\nTexas Hold \u2018Em\n\nDear Texas Hold \u2018Em,\n\nYou are between a rock and a hard place, that\u2019s for sure.\n\nSince your wife could join your plan at your job, she cannot get subsidies to buy a health plan from the Exchange or \u201cmarketplace\u201d. I am assuming that your plan at work meets the Affordable Care Act standards \u2013 which means that it costs you less than 9.5% of your income to cover yourself (not you and your wife, just you the employee). You should have received a letter from your employer or your plan telling you whether the plan meets health reform standards.\n\nThere are no limits in health reform about what an employer plan can charge you to cover your spouse and family members.\n\nYou could look at buying her a plan \u201coff exchange\u201d, which means that it would offer no subsidies. It is not likely that an off exchange plan would cost less than your group plan would. Nevertheless, it\u2019s worth finding an insurance agent to help you consider this option.\n\nSince your wife has a health problem, it is not desirable for her to go without insurance. If, however, you cannot find a way to afford a plan, then you should apply for any and all Patient Assistance programs at your local hospital and physician\u2019s office. Ask her current physician for help, ideas, and referrals to sliding-scale or free clinics. You can find these also at Needy Meds.\n\nLast, I would suggest applying for Social Security disability. This takes a lot of time and effort, but if her health issues are disabling, it is a way for her to get Medicare before she turns 65 and to get Medicaid. Texas is not expanding Medicaid, so she cannot qualify for this based upon your household income; she would have to be declared \u201cdisabled\u201d by Social Security to get this coverage.\n\nWhen she does get health insurance again \u2013 whether from your job, her new job or from a government program \u2013 she will be covered for all of her current health problems. Pre-existing conditions go away as of January 1, 2014.\n\nRecommend this article", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.1.5", "og": {"site_name": "Health Unsurance", "description": "\u201cMy wife is 62 years old and has been unemployed for nearly three months.\u00a0 She went from full time, to medical leave and then to being unemployed.\u00a0 She has been waiting to see if she is able to dra...", "title": "Affordable Care Act: COBRA too expensive, what to do", "url": "http://healthunsurance.bangordailynews.com/2014/01/03/spouse/1131/", "image": "http://i1.wp.com/healthunsurance.bangordailynews.com/files/2013/10/LR_photo_2013-75x75.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@bdnmaineblogs", "card": "summary"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "fb": {"app_id": 748756371893770}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-03T14:30:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-03T14:30:58+00:00", "author": "http://healthunsurance.bangordailynews.com/author/lridd2011/"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe3bcf\"", "article_summary": "She currently has no health insurance as her COBRA was way too much to afford.\nIt is not likely that an off exchange plan would cost less than your group plan would.\nAdding her to my work insurance is also way too much.\nSince your wife could join your plan at your job, she cannot get subsidies to buy a health plan from the Exchange or \u201cmarketplace\u201d.\nWhen she does get health insurance again \u2013 whether from your job, her new job or from a government program \u2013 she will be covered for all of her current health problems."}
