Hutchison, an attorney, represented Nevada when the state sued to try and stop President Barack Obama\u2019s health care insurance law, but Lowden pointed out he later voted for three bills in 2013 to implement the program \u2014 bills GOP Gov. Brian Sandoval signed into law despite his opposition to Obamacare.\n\nThe measures included business tax abatements, setting up so-called facilitators to the Silver State Health Insurance Exchange and passing the state budget, which expanded the Medicaid program for the poor.\n\nLowden said Nevada should have done what the states of Wisconsin, Florida and Kansas did, which is appeal to the federal government to get more money for Medicaid while reducing the rolls.\n\n\u201cWe should join that appeal and say we want our federal money to help those Medicaid patients,\u201d Lowden said.\n\nHutchison said he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d Lowden insinuated that he supports Obamacare when he doesn\u2019t. He said all of the Senate Republicans backed Sandoval in implementing the state health exchange once it was forced upon Nevada.\n\n\u201cAnyone who has not done anything to fight Obamacare, as my opponent has (not), is absolutely wrong and deceptive,\u201d Hutchison said.\n\nJon Ralston, who hosted the debate on his \u201cRalston Reports\u201d program on KSNV-TV, Channel 3, challenged Hutchison, asking whether the pure conservative position would have been to vote against anything having to do with Obamacare.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what he told my neighbor he was going to do,\u201d Lowden interjected in the freewheeling debate where the candidates talked over one another.\n\n\u201cThat is so insulting,\u201d Hutchison said, noting he spent hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars of his own money to fight Obamacare in court. \u201cEverything she says and does in this campaign is to criticize Brian Sandoval.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can be insulted all you want, Mark,\u201d Lowden said. \u201cI\u2019m the one who went against Harry Reid on Obamacare.\u201d\n\nIn 2010, Lowden ran in the GOP primary for Senate, but failed to win the nomination, which went to Sharron Angle.\n\nSandoval has endorsed Hutchison in the race, partly to ensure he gets the GOP lieutenant governor he wants to work with. Also, speculation is Sandoval may not finish his four-year term if re-elected this year as expected. Instead, he could run for the U.S. Senate in 2016 against U.S. Sen. Harry Reid-D-Nev., or return to the federal bench if he gets another appointment. For now, Sandoval said he wants to serve out his next four-year term.\n\nRalston asked Lowden about her 2010 campaign gaffe where she said that people could barter for their health care, even with chickens in rural Nevada. The Democratic Party stalked her with people in chicken suits throughout the campaign.\n\nAsked if she regretted her remarks, Lowden quipped, \u201cI regret how much money was put into the chickens.\u201d\n\nShe said she\u2019s been on the Nevada Medical Board for four years and knows that bartering does happen, mostly using cash in exchange for a reduced doctor\u2019s bill. \u201cIt does go on,\u201d she said of bartering.\n\nHutchison refused to engage the issue, saying, \u201cThat was Sue Lowden all by herself. I fought Obamacare on a constitutional basis. I didn\u2019t deal with bartering.\u201d\n\nThe two candidates also clashed on taxes, with Lowden accusing Hutchison of voting for dozens of bills during the 2013 session that involved raising various fees to boost revenues. He also went along with Sandoval to extend a $600 million package of taxes that had been scheduled to sunset. Finally, he backed a measure to hike the tax rate on mining to 10 percent, which could have raised $600 million for education.\n\nHutchison said he and other Republicans backed the proposed mining tax hike to counter a ballot measure by the teacher\u2019s union to impose a 2 percent margins tax on businesses that have annual revenue of $1 million or more.\n\n\u201cThis was in response to the margins tax,\u201d Hutchison said, adding it would have harmed business, giving Nevada the fourth highest corporate tax rate in the nation if it passes. \u201cThis was going to blow up our economy. Did I look at it (the mining tax) as defusing a nuclear bomb? Yes.\u201d\n\nLowden accused him of \u201cthrowing mining under the bus.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very clear he wanted a 10 percent tax,\u201d she said.\n\nAs for the list of fine increases Hutchison called Lowden \u201cvery deceptive\u201d because some of the hikes involving paying for enforcement provisions. One, for example, increased fines for Medicaid and welfare fraud. Another boosted fines on medical labs that violated the law. Another paid for license plates to honor Nevada\u2019s 150th anniversary this year.\n\n\u201cI wonder if my opponent has even read this,\u201d he said of the list of bills.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m saying I would have voted against all these fee increases,\u201d Lowden said.\n\nHutchison turned the tables and noted that when Lowden was a state senator in the 1990s she backed increased fees for a water district, real estate licenses and taxes on slot machines.\n\n\u201cAnd I made a mistake,\u201d said Lowden, who has been a casino executive for a couple of decades with her husband.\n\nHutchison said Lowden even backed raising fees on veterans to raise money for a cemetery.\n\nOn the issue of campaign debt, Ralston noted that Hutchison accused Lowden of saying she was going to pay off some $500,000 in leftover 2010 debt because she\u2019s running for lieutenant governor. He also criticized her for paying about 45 cents on the dollar to the vendors she owed.\n\n\u201cAs a small businessman, when you have accounts receivable for years and years \u2026 that\u2019s devastating to a small business,\u201d Hutchison said, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s between her and the voters.\u201d\n\nLowden said it\u2019s not true that she\u2019s repaying the debt only because she\u2019s running for public office. She said she had already paid back $2 million of the 2010 campaign debt, including $1 million she loaned herself. And she filed a plan with the Federal Election Commission to finish paying all of it off.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to say everything isn\u2019t paid,\u201d Lowden said, noting attorneys like Hutchison often negotiate settlements with debtors to repay part of what\u2019s owed. \u201cMark knows it\u2019s a normal business practice to do that.\u201d\n\nLowden also said Hutchison had to amend his state financial report three times. She didn\u2019t go into detail, but Hutchison once amended his report to show he received as a gift an all-expanses paid trip to Israel last year with other lawmakers.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m criticizing is somebody who\u2019s not paying their bills,\u201d Hutchison said.\n\n\u201cNo one is complaining but you, Mark,\u201d Lowden shot back.\n\nContact reporter Laura Myers at lmyers@reviewjournal.com or 702-387-2919.
