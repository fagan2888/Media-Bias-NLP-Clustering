And that\u2019s a problem now that giving thanks to God no longer plays a prominent role in American civic life.\n\nI know, I know, America is still \u201done Nation under God.\u201d We believe in Him by a landslide 74 percent to 26 percent margin. But, like me, a lot of us 74-percenters go to church about as often as the pope visits the United States.\n\nSo, as I was saying\u2026\n\nNow that giving thanks to God no longer plays a prominent role in American civic life, Whom or What do we thank on Thanksgiving?\n\nPraise Gov. of which all blessings smack.\n\nPraise It all creatures who are taxed.\n\nPraise It all ye electoral sort.\n\nPraise Pres., Congress, Supreme Court.\n\nThank you, Federal Meat Inspection Act of 1906, Poultry Product Inspection Act of 1957, and U.S. Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service, for the turkey.\n\nThank you, U.S. Food and Drug Administration\u2019s \u201cGuide to Minimize Food Safety Hazards for Fresh Fruits and Vegetables\u201d and 2014 Farm Bill Dairy Product Price Support Program, for our mashed potatoes.\n\nAnd thank you, USDA Cranberry Market Loss Assistance Program, for the cranberry sauce.\n\nLacking these laws, subsidies, regulations, and regulatory agencies, America\u2019s Pilgrim forefathers had to eat grass and tree bark at Thanksgiving, and then died of food poisoning.\n\nThank you, FCC, for all the football that is broadcast on Thanksgiving Day.\n\nMy wife and daughters thank you too, for C-SPAN, which gives non-football fans a Thanksgiving Reality TV alternative to Keeping Up with the Kardashians. NFL-averse viewers can choose between watching butts and watching asshats.\n\nThank you, Mr. President, for immigration reform. I\u2019m pretty sure the O\u2019Rourkes are undocumented aliens. We immigrated during the Potato Famine when there weren\u2019t a lot of documents and we didn\u2019t fill out any because we couldn\u2019t read or write. So now, at last, after 170 years, the O\u2019Rourkes can \u201ccome out of the shadows.\u201d\n\nAlso, thank you for this month\u2019s Affordable Care Act health insurance open enrollment. It\u2019s amazing how much I got done around the house while cradling a cordless phone receiver between my shoulder and ear. I raked the yard, swept out the garage, brushed the dog, put the dishes in the dishwasher, and did a load of laundry as I waited for someone to answer your 1-800 line. And what\u2019s this \u201c100% co-payment\u201d clause in my new policy? Does that mean that when the insurance company pays my doctor they also pay the same amount to me? Cool.\n\nPlus, Mr. President, thank you for your foreign policy. At first I was worried that you\u2019d whimp out. But when the time came you stepped up to the plate just like George W. Bush did. If it weren\u2019t for you, President Obama, Islamic militants might be threatening Americans the way they were before you deep-sixed Osama bin Laden. Heck, we might be fighting in Iraq again, Afghanistan and Pakistan might be sliding into chaos, Syria might be in the throes of a civil war, Libya might be a failed state, Egypt might be ruled by a dictator, Israelis and Palestinians might be at daggers drawn, NATO might be wobbly, and Vladimir Putin might be invading Ukraine.\n\nAnd thank you for raising taxes only on rich people. Oops\u2014just read the fine print. Turns out you\u2019ve decided I\u2019m rich.\n\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!

They\u2019re all going to die before 65 anyway, from getting hit by Uber while trying to watch YouTube at the same time they\u2019re riding their fixed-gear bikes.\n\nAnd thanks to all of you in government for being deadlocked on everything, because the two most frightening words in Washington are \u201cbipartisan consensus.\u201d Bipartisan consensus is like when my doctor and my lawyer agree with my wife that I need help.\n\nThank you, Chief Justice Roberts, et al., for opening the floodgates of political campaign donations. I\u2019m going to run on both tickets as a left-wing nut and a Tea Party lunatic and collect millions and millions of dollars in campaign funding and abscond to Andorra, which has no extradition treaty with the United States. (And Andorra is a tax haven with bargain luxury goods shopping and great ski slopes.)\n\nThank you, Federal Reserve for printing all that money for the past half dozen years. Although, Fed, if you print some more, I wouldn\u2019t mind you sending it directly to my bank account instead of sending it to the enormous, politically-connected bank where my account is.\n\nThank you, NSA. I\u2019m getting to the age when I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing half the time. I\u2019m glad somebody does.\n\nThank you, government policies, for the employment\u20142.7 million jobs have been added to the U.S. economy this year. And, thank you, government programs, for the unemployment benefits\u20143 million people have been added to the U.S. population this year.\n\nAnd, most of all, thank you federal, state, and local governments for magnificent public school systems. Here\u2019s a personal note of gratitude from my 16-year-old public high school student daughter: \u201cskool iz kool lke cuz i wudnt have bffs 2 txt an twt an fotobomb ifno skool YOLO:)\u201d", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "PJORourke"}, "keywords": "Thanksgiving, u.s. poli", "publicationDate": 201411271045, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "description": "Taking the time to thank our federal, state, and local bureaucracies for all the joy they bring us every day.", "pageNum": 1, "title": "Up to a Point: Thanks to the Biggest Turkey, Uncle Sam", "tags": "entity:holiday/thanksgiving,topic:politics", "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Up to a Point: Thanks to the Biggest Turkey, Uncle Sam\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/11/27/up-to-a-point-thanks-to-the-biggest-turkey-uncle-sam.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/11/27/up-to-a-point-thanks-to-the-biggest-turkey-uncle-sam/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/47236170.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/11/27/up-to-a-point-thanks-to-the-biggest-turkey-uncle-sam\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-11-27T10:45:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"Politics\",\"author\":\"P.
