The former New York City mayor is tiptoeing into running for the White House as a third party candidate, causing jitters amongst Democrats fearful that he might siphon off voters.\n\nLiberal media outlets speculate that Mr. Bloomberg thinks Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders may emerge as the standard-bearers for their prospective parties. From Bloomberg\u2019s perspective, they suggest, that match-up could allow a contestant who is fiscally conservative but socially liberal -- like himself -- to scoot through the middle.\n\nRelated: Clinton and Obama Launch Their Mutual Support Group\n\nAnother explanation is that he sees trouble ahead for Hillary Clinton. Because of his close relationship with former NYC police Chief Ray Kelly and others in the law enforcement community, he might have the inside track on the FBI investigation into the former Secretary of State\u2019s handling of classified documents and questionable foundation-related activities. Democrats have done a fine job of completely dismissing the FBI inquiry, but the possibility that Clinton could face serious legal hurdles may be encouraging Bloomberg\u2019s ambitions.\n\nThe probe is not, as some Hillary backers have claimed, scandal-mongering by right-wing zealots. It is a serious investigation, reportedly employing more than 100 FBI agents not normally known for idle gestures. It is being directed by the famously apolitical James Comey, who heads President Obama\u2019s FBI. Comey faced down apparatchiks in the George W. Bush administration seeking to continue a warrantless wiretapping program, putting his job on the line to do so. When a reporter asked him if he didn\u2019t have a duty to support President Bush, Comey answered \u201cNo, my responsibility, I took an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States.\u201d\n\nObama proudly cited that independent streak when he announced Comey\u2019s appointment. If the FBI discovers evidence of wrong-doing \u2013 and there are many reasons to think they will \u2013 Comey will not sit on the findings. The FBI does not indict; that is up to the Justice Department. But, if the FBI makes a recommendation to indict, and Justice ignores the report, rumor is the FBI could make public the incriminating material. Either way, Hillary Clinton\u2019s political ambitions are toast.\n\nRelated: Why Every Candidate in the 2016 Race Should Fear Mike Bloomberg\n\nThe inquiry began by looking into whether Clinton\u2019s use of a personal email server violated security standards; it has since been expanded twice. As reported by Judge Andrew Napolitano of Fox News, Clinton signed an oath promising to comply with the laws protecting national security information, violations that the Obama administration has aggressively prosecuted.\n\nAs Napolitano says, \u201cThe Obama Department of Justice prosecuted a young sailor for espionage for sending a selfie to his girlfriend, because in the background of the photo was a view of a sonar screen on a submarine\u2026. It also prosecuted Gen. David Petraeus for espionage for keeping secret and top-secret documents in an unlocked drawer in his desk inside his guarded home. It alleged that he shared those secrets with a friend who also had a security clearance, but it dropped those charges.\u201d\n\nNapolitano contends that the bar for prosecution is low, and can be based on negligence. That is, the government need not prove that Clinton intended to reveal state secrets \u2013 only that she did so through carelessness.\n\nCharles McCullough, the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general, recently stirred the pot when he wrote to the chairmen of the Senate intelligence and foreign affairs committees that he has received sworn declarations from an intelligence agency he declined to name identifying \u201cseveral dozen\u201d classified emails, including several marked as \u201cspecial access programs\u201d \u2013 the highest security level possible. SAP information can include the names of intelligence assets, for instance, and other highly sensitive information. To date, some 1,340 \u201cclassified\u201d emails have been discovered amongst those stored on Clinton\u2019s server.\n\nClinton argues that those communications were not so designated at the time. Undermining her defense is a series of emails exchanged with aide Jake Sullivan in which she appears to order him to get around security protocol and simply cut and paste sensitive information to be faxed to her. The compromising communication was amongst those released in a recent Friday night \u201cdump.\u201d In the exchange, Sullivan reports that staffers have \u201chad issues sending secure fax. They\u2019re working on it.\u201d Clinton answers, \u201cIf they can\u2019t, turn into non-paper w no identifying heading and send non-secure.\u201d The intent is clear.\n\nRelated: How the FBI Could Derail Hillary Clinton\u2019s Presidential Run\n\nMeanwhile, Clinton and her operatives continue to brush off this major FBI investigation as unimportant. They have claimed that the information sent by Charles McCullough III, a long-time FBI agent who was appointed by Obama as the first Inspector General of the Intelligence Community in 2011, is part of a Republican conspiracy. In Clinton\u2019s world, everything is a \u201cvast right-wing conspiracy,\u201d as she famously declared the Monica Lewinsky scandal. She may be able to cow a teenage intern; James Comey may be tougher to dismiss.\n\nFor Bloomberg, Clinton\u2019s problems may be but one of his many reasons to run. His initial election as Mayor of New York City in 2001 occurred against a backdrop of political chaos, similar to what we are seeing nationally today. Former Republican Mayor Rudy Giuliani could not run because of term limits; it was widely expected that he would be succeeded by a Democrat in the very blue city. However, the liberal Mark Green defeated Fernando Ferrer in a nasty primary battle with racist overtones, alienating blacks and other Democratic voters. Bloomberg, a lifelong Democrat, switched to the GOP to run, narrowly defeating the bruised and battered Green. So, his political opportunism has worked before.\n\nPerhaps most persuasive to Mayor Mike, running for president, however long the odds, would give him a platform for the next several months on which he could push his favorite causes. He is an avid supporter of increased gun control as well as a climate change activist. He has been out of office and with a muted national voice for two years; $40 billion will buy quite a megaphone.\n\nClinton\u2019s legal problems could make that megaphone a whole lot bigger.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Does Mike Bloomberg know something we don\u2019t?", "title": "Does Mike Bloomberg Know Something We Don\u2019t About the Clinton FBI Probe?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2016/01/27/Does-Mike-Bloomberg-Know-Something-We-Don-t-About-Clinton-FBI-Probe", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/wpid-2013-03-24T153211Z_1_CBRE92N175X00_RTROPTP_2_SODABAN-LAWSUIT-BLOOMBERG.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2016/01/27/Does-Mike-Bloomberg-Know-Something-We-Don-t-About-Clinton-FBI-Probe", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/wpid-2013-03-24T153211Z_1_CBRE92N175X00_RTROPTP_2_SODABAN-LAWSUIT-BLOOMBERG.jpg", "creator": "@lizpeek", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Does Mike Bloomberg know something we don\u2019t?", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Related: Clinton and Obama Launch Their Mutual Support GroupAnother explanation is that he sees trouble ahead for Hillary Clinton.\nRelated: How the FBI Could Derail Hillary Clinton\u2019s Presidential RunMeanwhile, Clinton and her operatives continue to brush off this major FBI investigation as unimportant.\nEither way, Hillary Clinton\u2019s political ambitions are toast.\nDoes Mike Bloomberg know something we don\u2019t?\nDemocrats have done a fine job of completely dismissing the FBI inquiry, but the possibility that Clinton could face serious legal hurdles may be encouraging Bloomberg\u2019s ambitions."}
