As the website explains, the Affordable Care Act specifically allocated funds to provide affordable insurance coverage to approximately 500,000 people in our state. Unfortunately, the Governor and the legislature have blocked those funds from coming to North Carolina. Many of the individuals and families who could use this money to get insurance coverage work in low-wage professions like construction, day care, and food service.\n\nAt a press conference today Dana Wilson, a woman in the coverage gap who suffers from MS, shared her story. You can watch her video here.\n\nThe legislature and the Governor need to hear from more people like Dana, the working poor who are being unfairly denied coverage. If you are in the coverage gap please consider sharing your story on the NC Left Me Out website. If you want to support the campaign then you can sign up as well.\n\nEvery week a new Governor shows the leadership to formulate a plan for extending insurance coverage to people in the Medicaid gap. Last week the conservative state of Indiana had a plan approved. States like Wyoming and Utah are moving forward with similar ideas. We need Governor McCrory to show us his plan for closing the coverage gap. He has publicly hinted that he wants to design a state-specific Medicaid waiver. Great, let\u2019s get moving. Every day that we wait is another day people like Dana suffer.\n\nWe need to continue telling our stories to the media, to legislators, and to the Governor. If the economic arguments and moral arguments don\u2019t win the day, maybe looking into the eyes of those who have been denied coverage will begin changing minds.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "At a press conference today Dana Wilson, a woman in the coverage gap who suffers from MS, shared her story.\nEvery week a new Governor shows the leadership to formulate a plan for extending insurance coverage to people in the Medicaid gap.\nIf you are in the coverage gap please consider sharing your story on the NC Left Me Out website.\nWe need Governor McCrory to show us his plan for closing the coverage gap.\nAs the website explains, the Affordable Care Act specifically allocated funds to provide affordable insurance coverage to approximately 500,000 people in our state."}
