Instead, while perusing my electronic medical file recently, I found a note that totally stumped me: \u201cmultigravida.\u201d\n\nClicking on this record brought up the following message: \u201cTwins, triplets, multiple births. If you are pregnant with more than one baby, you are far from alone.\u201d Huh, what? I haven\u2019t been pregnant with one baby, let alone multiples. How could such an erroneous term \u2014 it\u2019s a technical term for a pregnant woman who has been pregnant one or more times previously \u2014 end up on my medical record?\n\nIt\u2019s not uncommon for medical records to contain errors, says Trisha Torrey, founder of the Alliance for Professional Health Advocates. Torrey recommends that all patients take the time to closely examine their medical records. Doing so paid huge dividends for Torrey, when she discovered an error that had led her to become wrongly diagnosed with cancer. Had she not been so diligent about scrutinizing her records, she would have undergone chemotherapy and other cancer treatments that she never needed.\n\nUnder the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, you have a right to view and obtain a copy of your medical record, Rachel Seeger, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Office for Civil Rights, said in an e-mailed statement. If you find inaccuracies, HIPAA gives you the right to have these errors corrected.\n\nIf your doctor uses an electronic patient portal, as mine does, you may be able to look at your records from home, without charge. If your provider can\u2019t share your records electronically, you may have to pay for them. Under HIPAA, health plans and health-care providers are allowed to charge a \u201creasonable\u201d fee for copying and mailing the records, Seeger said. \u201cReasonable\u201d isn\u2019t legally defined, however.\n\nWhile the transition from paper to electronic records makes it simpler for patients to view their records, it has also made it easy to introduce mistakes into the records due to data input or transcription errors, and this is especially true when paper records are turned into electronic ones, Torrey says. \u201cSometimes older paper records are scanned into an optical character recognition program and they come out wrong.\u201d\n\nA 2012 study examined more than 300 reports of problems involving faulty records at Pennsylvania hospitals and found that errors in electronic medical records could become amplified when the inaccurate information was shared with other providers \u2014 for instance, when it was transmitted to pharmacists who then prescribed the wrong medication.\n\nWhen I discovered the error in my record, I sent a message to my doctor\u2019s office asking about the discrepancy. The practice assured me that \u201con our side of the chart, it lists 0 previous pregnancies. Sorry for the confusion.\u201d I went back to my chart and saw that it still listed \u201cmultigravida\u201d in the section marked \u201cpast medical history.\u201d\n\nSo would it be worth the hassle to keep insisting that my doctor\u2019s office correct this mistake?\n\nAbsolutely, says Melody McCloud, an obstetrician-gynecologist and the medical director of Atlanta Women\u2019s Health Care.\n\nYou also should check your medical record to ensure that you and your insurance company are being properly billed.\n\nTake a close look at the notes and billing records associated with your visits to make sure that you received the care it says you did, advises Torrey. The Affordable Care Act mandates that certain types of preventive care, such as Pap tests and other preventive visits, don\u2019t carry a co-pay, but if the office tacks on a service that you didn\u2019t receive, you may be billed extra, she says.\n\nWhen I switched to my current doctor, I requested a copy of my medical record from my previous physician. I was surprised to see that the doctor\u2019s notes for my last visit noted that we \u201cdiscussed stress management, healthy diet, health weight, and exercise.\u201d And more: \u201csunscreen use, seatbelt use and basic healthy lifestyle choices\u201d (whatever those are). I am quite certain that she never discussed these issues with me, nor had she raised them at previous appointments, which contained the exact same sentences in their notes.\n\nGiven that the wording about all those things we (didn\u2019t) discuss was identical, I assumed that this must be some sort of boilerplate note that this doctor puts in all of her records. But why say we talked about something if we didn\u2019t? Usually mistakes like these happen when a doctor is just checking boxes on a computer or adding automatic entries to your record, rather than writing a narrative account of the visit, McCloud says.\n\nListing services that I didn\u2019t receive isn\u2019t just dishonest, in some cases it may also represent fraud, Torrey says, if it means the office can use a billing code that leads to additional reimbursement. If you find notes about a service or discussion that didn\u2019t actually take place, you should also take a closer look at your billing record to see if you were charged for something you didn\u2019t receive, she says.\n\nIf the discrepancy results in a billing error, you should contact your insurance company. Even if it doesn\u2019t, you can insist on a correction. When you and your provider disagree about the accuracy of the information in your record, HIPAA gives you the right to have a statement about your disagreement added to the file.\n\nYour medical record is your health-care providers\u2019 reference book for your health, so the importance of making sure it\u2019s accurate can\u2019t be overstated, McCloud says. What\u2019s in the record may dictate the treatments and testing you receive and the advice your doctor orders.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s your story,\u201d McCloud says, \u201cand so it can\u2019t be fiction.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "health, health records, doctor records, electronic health records, hippa", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "As medical files go electronic, mistakes can be made.
