Lynn Britton, CEO of Mercy Health: “In 2014, the healthcare system will be marked by an influx of patients — those with more chronic disease, those who are members of an aging cohort and many patients who have not heretofore had access to care — all pressing in on a very stressed physician provider community experiencing shortages and sweeping reimbursement challenges.”

Bernard Tyson, CEO of Kaiser Permanente: “We have not seen this level of fundamental change in the American health care system since Medicare was enacted in the 1960s, and while the goals of the Affordable Care Act are clear, there are a significant number of elements that are still unknown, such as how many people will sign up for health insurance, what the demographics will be related to the risk pool, and how prepared newly insured Americans will be when it comes to navigating the health care system.

William Winkenwerder, CEO of Highmark Health: “I anticipate that in 2014 we will face even more significant problems and challenges than we saw in 2013, as the reform effort begins to directly affect the employer-based insurance market. It could be a mess, but that is not something anyone should hope will happen.”
