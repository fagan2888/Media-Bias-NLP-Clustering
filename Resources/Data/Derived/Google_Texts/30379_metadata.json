Then he let out a yell as the scale settled on 38.00 pounds, enough to give the crew of the boat Full Nelson a razor-thin margin over first-day leader Chili Pepper.\n\nThe differential was 0.21 pounds, or about the weight of a deck of playing cards. But it was worth plenty.\n\nIn addition to the $25,000 first-place check, Full Nelson also won the Tournament Within A Tournaments for largest fish and two-fish aggregate, Super Tournament Within A Tournament and Early Entry prizes. Altogether, Full Nelson won $52,555.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a very happy person and so is my crew,\u201d Nelson said.\n\nIn addition to second, Chili Pepper finished second in the TWT for largest fish and first in the Single Outboard Engine division, totaling $12,531.\n\nFull Nelson is owned by Kenneth Nelson of James Island. Thames was the angler and Allen Heape and James Lawton also crewed on the boat. Chili Pepper is owned by John Gaeto of Charleston. Robbie Mullen was the angler for Chili Pepper\u2019s catch.\n\n\u201cWe felt like it was a good fish,\u201d Nelson said of the catch made about 11:30 a.m. \u201cWe caught a good one yesterday, 31 (pounds) and some change. We were on some good fish.\u201d\n\nNelson said the winning fish was caught using a live bar jack for bait.\n\nGaeto was disappointed but happy for Nelson. He said the Chili Pepper lost a cylinder on its engine Saturday and decided to return early because the engine was running so rough.\n\nRESULTS\n\nOverall\n\n1. Full Nelson, Kenneth Nelson, 38.00; 2.
