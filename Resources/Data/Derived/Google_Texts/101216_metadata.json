On the eve of the New Hampshire primary, a new poll shows Vermont U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders maintaining a big lead over former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, while nearly two-thirds of likely Democratic primary voters believe he will be the winner on Tuesday. More\n\nShe also said Sanders\u2019 proposal for a single-payer health plan \u201clooks good on paper,\u201d but she said it is wrong to try to \u201cstart over\u201d on health care.\n\nTrailing in polling a day before voters in New Hampshire cast their ballots, Clinton, at a rally at Manchester Community College, said she has not been swayed by taking Wall Street money. She said Sanders did the same, although, she said, in his case, the money was funneled through the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.\n\nSanders\u2019 campaign responded by accusing the Clinton campaign of spreading \u201cfalsehoods\u201d and charged that the Clinton campaign has become \u201cincreasingly negative and dishonest.\u201d\n\nCampaign manager Jeff Weaver said Sanders will not dismantle health care programs and called her charge that he took Wall Street donations \u201cfalse and absurd,\u201d his campaign manager said.\n\nClinton, introduced at the packed event by former President Bill Clinton and their daughter, Chelsea Clinton, fought back against Sanders\u2019 continued criticism of her for taking donations and speakers\u2019 fees from Wall Street firms.\n\nShe said she has been \u201cspeaking out against, and working to rein in, powerful forces for many years. I have scars to prove that.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd they have spent a lot of money against me,\u201d Hillary Clinton said. \u201cImagine. If Wall Street were interested in supporting Democrats like (President Barack Obama) and me for their own reasons, why are they spending $6 million trying to defeat me?\u201d\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t just talked. I haven\u2019t just given speeches. I\u2019ve introduced legislation. I\u2019ve called them out. I\u2019ve gone to Wall Street. I said they were going to wreck the economy over the mortgage market.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey know where I stand because I\u2019ve always stood there,\u201d Clinton insisted.\n\n\u201cAnd like President Obama, I\u2019ve taken donations, there\u2019s no doubt about that,\u201d she said.\n\nShe said donations taken by Obama did not stop him from signing the Dodd-Frank bill into law.\n\n\u201cAnd you know,\u201d Clinton continued, \u201cSen. Sanders took about $200,000 from Wall Street firms. Not directly, but through the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee,\u201d the party group that pours money into campaigns to help Democratic U.S. Senate candidates.\n\n\u201cYou know, there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. It hasn\u2019t changed his view.\"\n\n\u201cWell, it didn\u2019t change my view or my vote, either,\u201d she said.\n\nClinton also hit Sanders on his call for a single-payer health plan.\n\nShe said the Affordable Care Act was a major accomplishment and she wants to build on it.\n\n\u201cBut what we cannot do is start over,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cWe cannot take what looks good on paper, an idea, and say, \u2018You know what? We\u2019re going to thrust our nation into a contentious debate and start all over.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot easier to get from 90 percent coverage to 100 than it is to get from zero to 100.\u201d\n\nSanders\u2019 campaign manager Weaver responded with a statement blasting the Clinton campaign on Wall Street, health care and other issues.\n\n\u201cIt is very disturbing that, as the Clinton campaign struggles through Iowa and New Hampshire, they have become increasingly negative and dishonest. Bernie Sanders will not dismantle health care programs in America. He believes in health care for all. Bernie Sanders is not \u2018attacking\u2019 Planned Parenthood. He believes Planned Parenthood is an outstanding organization and wants to increase its funding. No, Bernie Sanders is not \u2018protecting\u2019 the gun lobby. He has a D- record from the NRA.\"\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s attack from Secretary Clinton, whose super PAC received $15 million from Wall Street, is even more absurd, \u201cWeaver said. \u201cBernie Sanders, who has never accepted corporate PAC money in his life, is now accused by Secretary Clinton of taking \u2018about $200,000 from Wall Street firms.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do they reach that false and absurd conclusion? They assume that every nickel Bernie Sanders received from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee for his Senate campaign came from Wall Street. That is obviously preposterous,\u201d Weaver said.\n\n\u201cBernie appreciates the help he has gotten from the DSCC, whose funds come from millions of Americans\u2019 individual contributions, labor organizations, environmental groups, women\u2019s organizations and others.\u201d\n\nEarlier, former President Clinton told the rally, \u201cIt bothers me to be in an election where debate is impossible because if you disagree, you are just part of the establishment.\u201d\n\nIn Manchester, there was no outward sign at the rally that the Clinton campaign was reeling. The private consensus among several supporters was that if she does not win the primary, she will make the contest close enough to say that she staged a comeback in the final days \u2013 not unlike her husband\u2019s late surge to second place in a crowded 1992 primary field.\n\nManchester attorney Terry Shumaker, who has been ever-present at Clinton campaign events dating back 25 years, was not about to concede anything to Sanders.\n\n\u201cI never buy the polls in the New Hampshire primary,\u201d Shumaker said. \u201cIt\u2019s just too fluid, too unpredictable.\u201d\n\nShumaker said the Clinton campaign has a massive, highly effective ground operation that does not show up in polling.\n\nSanders has said he is not taking for granted that he will win the primary.\n\nThe result is that if Hillary Clinton finishes within single-digits of Sanders, she can declare that she exceeded what are currently low expectations.\n\nExecutive Councilor Chris Pappas, a Clinton supporter, said: \u201cThe people of Manchester are going to decide this election.\u201d\n\nManchester is viewed as a \u201cmust\u201d stronghold for Clinton if she hopes to make inroads and come close to, or defeat, Sanders.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics", "ib-analytics": "data", "item-publish-date": "Mon, 08 Feb 2016 21:12:42 EST", "generator": "ibPublish 2", "author": "John DiStaso", "og": {"site_name": "WMUR", "description": "Hillary Clinton, fighting to win or at least avoid embarrassment in the first-in-the-nation presidential primary, implied Monday that Democratic foe Bernie Sanders is hypocritical for calling her out on her acceptance of donations from Wall Street corporate interests.", "title": "Clinton, Sanders clash on Wall Street donations, health care", "url": "http://www.wmur.com/politics/clinton-sanders-clash-on-corporate-donations-health-care/37890608", "image": "http://www.wmur.com/image/view/-/37888358/medRes/2/-/maxh/630/maxw/1200/-/pd65yez/-/img-Sanders-Clinton-make-last-minute-push-in-NH.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.wmur.com/politics/clinton-sanders-clash-on-corporate-donations-health-care/37890608", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "wmur://content/article/37890608", "iphone": "wmur://content/article/37890608", "googleplay": "wmur://content/article/37890608"}, "name": {"ipad": "wmur", "iphone": "wmur", "googleplay": "wmur"}, "id": {"ipad": 504646663, "iphone": 504646663, "googleplay": "com.hearst.android.wmur"}}, "site": "@wmur9", "card": "app"}, "al": {"android": {"url": "wmur://content/article/37890608", "app_name": "wmur", "package": "com.hearst.android.wmur"}, "ios": {"url": "wmur://content/article/37890608", "app_store_id": 504646663, "app_name": "wmur"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 98665743246}, "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.wmur.com/politics/clinton-sanders-clash-on-corporate-donations-health-care/37890608"}, "google-site-verification": "xTJFxn8Gm6mXV5ugnbTb198craV_CkoMGMqQyL4EfS4", "keywords": "Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, Commitment 2016", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/JohnDiStasoWMUR"}, "news_keywords": "Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, Commitment 2016", "description": "Hillary Clinton, fighting to win or at least avoid embarrassment in the first-in-the-nation presidential primary, implied Monday that Democratic foe Bernie Sanders is hypocritical for calling her out on her acceptance of donations from Wall Street corporate interests."}, "article_summary": "Clinton, introduced at the packed event by former President Bill Clinton and their daughter, Chelsea Clinton, fought back against Sanders\u2019 continued criticism of her for taking donations and speakers\u2019 fees from Wall Street firms.\nSanders\u2019 campaign responded by accusing the Clinton campaign of spreading \u201cfalsehoods\u201d and charged that the Clinton campaign has become \u201cincreasingly negative and dishonest.\u201dCampaign manager Jeff Weaver said Sanders will not dismantle health care programs and called her charge that he took Wall Street donations \u201cfalse and absurd,\u201d his campaign manager said.\nThey assume that every nickel Bernie Sanders received from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee for his Senate campaign came from Wall Street.\n\u201cToday\u2019s attack from Secretary Clinton, whose super PAC received $15 million from Wall Street, is even more absurd, \u201cWeaver said.\n\u201cIt is very disturbing that, as the Clinton campaign struggles through Iowa and New Hampshire, they have become increasingly negative and dishonest."}
