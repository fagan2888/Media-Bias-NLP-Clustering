The Tennessee Hospital Association, the state Chamber of Commerce and Democrats say Mr. Haslam cannot afford to wait much longer.\n\nThe National Conference of State Legislatures says that as of this month, 21 states, all of them with Republican governors or Republican-dominated legislatures, have announced that they would not expand Medicaid, while 27 others, plus the District of Columbia, have already approved an expansion or indicated that they would do so. The election this month of Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat and a supporter of the health care act, as governor of Virginia makes it likely that the state will join the expanders.\n\nThat leaves just Tennessee and Pennsylvania, where Gov. Tom Corbett has also asked the Obama administration for permission to use federal funds to buy private health insurance for the uninsured poor, on the fence.\n\nA son of the Knoxville, Tenn., founder of Pilot Flying J, the nation\u2019s largest chain of truck stops and travel centers, Mr. Haslam remains a popular figure in his state. A May poll by Vanderbilt University\u2019s Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions showed him with a 63 percent approval rating. The same poll, however, found that 60 percent of respondents favored the expansion of Medicaid in the state.\n\nMr. Haslam, 55, ran for mayor of Knoxville in 2003 as a pro-business conservative, and was re-elected in 2007 with 87 percent of the vote. In 2010, he ran for governor, winning with 65 percent of the vote. He is up for re-election next year and is a prohibitive favorite, with nary a primary challenger in sight and no strong Democratic challenger yet, either.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn Tennessee, opposition to expanding Medicaid has come largely from Republican officeholders and conservative groups. Arrayed on the other side are the Tennessee Hospital Association and other medical groups, the Tennessee Chamber of Commerce and Industry and local chambers across the state, several antipoverty organizations and the Democratic opposition.\n\nRecent layoffs at a few Tennessee hospitals have focused attention on their plight \u2014 and complicated Mr. Haslam\u2019s decision.\n\nPhoto\n\nDavid McClure, senior vice president for finance at the state hospital association, said that failing to expand Medicaid would have a devastating effect on the state\u2019s 165 hospitals, leading to layoffs and the closing of some facilities.\n\n\u201cIn every community that has a hospital, we are typically the biggest or one of the biggest employers,\u201d Mr. McClure said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be Chicken Little and say the sky is falling, but there will be some hospitals that will close.\u201d\n\nSince hospitals are required to treat patients who show up in their emergency rooms, whether or not they can pay, hospital officials had hoped that adding more poor people to Medicaid rolls would absorb some of those costs, Mr. McClure said.\n\nWithout an expansion of Medicaid, hundreds of thousands of Tennessee residents would fall into a gap, making too little money to get subsidized health coverage under the act and too much to qualify for Medicaid. The authors of the Affordable Care Act had assumed that states would expand their Medicaid rolls \u2014 which they had been required to do until the Supreme Court struck down that provision \u2014 providing coverage for these working poor families who fell into the gap.\n\nThe hospital association estimates that 400,000 Tennesseans fall into that gap. Other estimates are somewhat lower.\n\nDeepening the angst over this decision is the state\u2019s own history with managed health care. Tennessee\u2019s homegrown health care system, TennCare, went through a wrenching downsizing in 2005, when the program was totally state sponsored. More than 170,000 people had to be thrown off the TennCare rolls.\n\nEven though the federal government is promising to pay 100 percent of the new Medicaid costs for the first three years and most of the costs after that, Mr. Haslam said he was worried that later administrations might renege on that promise.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIf at some point we\u2019re going to have to cut people off the rolls,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure we\u2019d want to go through that again. Our history makes us a little wary.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20131116134923, "twitter": {"description": "As a Jan. 1 deadline looms, Gov.
