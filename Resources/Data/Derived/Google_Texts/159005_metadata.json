The next time a scandal develops involving one of the newspaper's largest advertisers, Khahaifa will be forced into the untenable no-win position of having to decide between aggressively pursuing the story or not risking the loss of a big revenue-generating customer. In the article, he said he knew where the \"fault lines\" run between the revenue and newsroom sides of the organization.\"\n\nJustin Dearborn, CEO of Tribune Publishing Tribune Publishing Justin C. Dearborn, announced as new CEO of Tribune Publishing Co. on Tuesday, Feb. 23, 2016. Justin C. Dearborn, announced as new CEO of Tribune Publishing Co. on Tuesday, Feb. 23, 2016. (Tribune Publishing) (Tribune Publishing)\n\nHaving made this change at seven other Tribune newspapers, Dearborn said these managers have the trust of their readers and maintain the highest standards of integrity. With no disrespect whatsoever intended to Khahaifa, just ask anyone on the street if they trust any newspaper to be unbiased and objective. Combining these two roles only serves to increase readers' skepticism of the media.\n\nTo help the community understand it, reporter Mary Shanklin should delve into what's going on at this very influential Orlando company with the same vigor as Kate Santich did on the termination of Carol Wick as the CEO of Harbor House.\n\nGeorge W. Koehn Orlando Sentinel Editorial Advisory Board member from Winter Park\n\nSet aside politics\n\nAs the legislative session winds down, I keep a close eye on not only what bills pass, but why they are held up by legislative action or, in the end, a governor's veto.\n\nThe Orlando Sentinel gave us an example of this Thursday, reporting that UCF Downtown passed but still faces a budget issue and a governor's veto (\"UCF wins approval for downtown plan\"). This happened last year because Senate President Andy Gardiner and Gov. Rick Scott disagreed.\n\nIn my little corner of the world, the training and job development we want to do for the developmentally disabled passed all the hurdles the Sentinel talks about. For example, our job program called Giving Real Opportunities for Work is in the Senate and House budgets for $316,060, and our communities have raised $105,000 in local match. But due to the tenuous relationship between the governor and legislators, it faces a session-ending possible veto, which would inhibit jobs for our disabled and stifle their independence.\n\nDoes this make any sense in the face of real people issues rather than politics as usual?\n\nJim Berko volunteer board of directors, Seminole Work Opportunity Program\n\nObamacare sacrifice\n\nConceptually, I like Obamacare, but as someone whose family fits in the upper-middle-class profile, the reality of it disappoints. My husband and I have incurred a ridiculous increase in premiums and co-pays, as well as deductibles, since the Affordable Care Act was passed; plus we are now subject to a 3 percent additional tax for Medicare. This is after paying more than $150,000 in taxes.\n\nNothing in life is free. Somebody will pay. Consider it in the concept of salvation. Grace is free for us, but Jesus paid with his life. I'm all for helping those in need, but I'll be darned if I will pay by sacrificing my family's well-being and future retirement for free stuff for others, and that is exactly what the Democratic candidates for president expect.\n\nDiana Douglas Clermont", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Editor/publisher combo a potential conflict: Letters", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Orlando Sentinel", "author": "Orlando Sentinel", "og": {"site_name": "OrlandoSentinel.com", "description": "Today's Orlando Sentinel Letters to the Editor for March 5, 2016.", "title": "Editor/publisher combo a potential conflict: Letters", "url": "http://www.orlandosentinel.com/opinion/os-ed-letters-sentinel-editor-publisher-030516-20160304-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56da4970/turbine/os-ed-letters-sentinel-editor-publisher-030516-20160304", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp12.17", "twitter": {"site": "@orlandosentinel", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "Orlando Sentinel Letters to the Editor", "fb": {"admins": 100004353067097, "page_id": 5779052556, "app_id": 890804050949750}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=402223551, app-argument=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/deeplinkid/86116953", "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2016-03-04", "Description": "Today's Orlando Sentinel Letters to the Editor for March 5, 2016", "y_key": "fb73650ad672fe45", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Orlando Sentinel Letters to the Editor"}, "article_summary": "Justin Dearborn, CEO of Tribune Publishing Tribune Publishing Justin C.
