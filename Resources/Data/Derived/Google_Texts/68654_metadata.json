Net earnings fell to $58 million, or 40 cents a share, from $68 million, or 47 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted earnings per share of 54 cents was below the FactSet consensus of 55 cents. Revenue rose 25% to $405 million, but missed the FactSet consensus of $412.9 million, as revenue from click-based advertising, display-based advertising and subscription, transaction and other revenue all increased less than expected.
