I\u2019m a member of the na\u00efve, stupid, and cowardly one. I\u2019m a Republican.\n\nHow stupid is the GOP? They still don\u2019t get it.\n\nI told them 5 years ago, 2 books ago, a national bestseller ago (\"The Ultimate Obama Survival Guide\"), and in hundreds of articles and commentaries, that ObamaCare was never meant to help America, or heal the sick, or lower healthcare costs, or lower the debt, or expand the economy.\n\nThe GOP needs to stop calling ObamaCare a \u201ctrainwreck.\u201d That means it\u2019s a mistake, or accident. That means it\u2019s a gigantic flop, or failure. It\u2019s NOT.\n\n[pullquote]\n\nThis is a brilliant, cynical, and purposeful attempt to damage the U.S. economy, kill jobs, and bring down capitalism.\n\nIt\u2019s not a failure, it\u2019s Obama\u2019s grand success.\n\nIt\u2019s not a \u201ctrainwreck,\u201d ObamaCare is a suicide attack. He wants to hurt us, to bring us to our knees, to capitulate- so we agree under duress to accept big government.\n\nObama\u2019s hero and mentor was Saul Alinsky -- a radical Marxist intent on destroying capitalism. Alinksky\u2019s stated advice was to call the other guy \u201ca terrorist\u201d to hide your own intentions.\n\nTo scream that the other guy is \u201cruining America,\u201d while you are the one actually plotting the destruction of America. To claim again and again\u2026in every sentence of every speech\u2026that you are \u201csaving the middle class,\u201d while you are busy wiping out the middle class.\n\nThe GOP is so stupid they can\u2019t see it. There are no mistakes here. This is a planned purposeful attack.\n\nThe tell-tale sign isn\u2019t the disastrous start to ObamaCare. Or the devastating effect the new taxes are having on the economy. Or the death of full-time jobs. Or the overwhelming debt. Or the dramatic increases in health insurance rates. Or the 70% of doctors now thinking of retiring- bringing on a healthcare crisis of unimaginable proportions. Forget all that.\n\nThe real sign that this is a purposeful attack upon capitalism is how many Obama administration members and Democratic Congressmen are openly calling Tea Party Republicans and anyone who wants to stop ObamaCare \u201cterrorists.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s the clue. Even the clueless GOP should be able to see that.\n\nThey are calling the reasonable people\u2026the patriots\u2026the people who believe in the Constitution ... the people who believe exactly what the Founding Fathers believed\u2026the people who want to take power away from corrupt politicians who have put America $17 trillion in debt\u2026terrorists?\n\nThat\u2019s because they are Saul Alinsky-ing the GOP. The people trying to purposely hurt America, capitalism and the middle class\u2026are calling the patriots by a terrible name to fool, confuse and distract the public.\n\nObamaCare is a raving, rollicking, fantastic success. Stop calling it a failure. Here is what it was created to do. It is succeeding on all counts:\n\n1. ObamaCare was intended to bring about the Marxist dream -- redistribution of wealth.\n\nRich people, small business owners, and the middle class are being robbed, so that the money can be redistributed to poor people (who vote for Democrats).\n\nThink about it. If you\u2019re rich or middle class, you now have to pay for your own health care costs (at much higher rates) AND 40 million other people\u2019s costs too (through massive tax increases).\n\nSo you\u2019re stuck paying for both bills. You are left broke. Brilliant.\n\n2. ObamaCare was intended to wipe out the middle class and make them dependent on government.\n\nThink about it. Even Obama\u2019s IRS predicts that health insurance for a typical American family by 2016 will be $20,000 per year. But how would middle class Americans pay that bill and have anything left for food or housing or living? People that make $40K, or $50K, or $60K can\u2019t possibly hope to spend $20K on health insurance without becoming homeless.\n\nBingo. That\u2019s how you make middle class people dependent on government. That\u2019s how you make everyone addicted to government checks. Brilliant.\n\n3. As a bonus, ObamaCare is intended to kill every decent paying job in the economy, creating only crummy, crappy part-time jobs.\n\nWhy? Just to make sure the middle class is trapped, with no way out. Just to make sure no one has the $20,000 per year to pay for health insurance, thereby guaranteeing they become wards of the state. Brilliant.\n\n4. ObamaCare is intended to bankrupt small business, and therefore starve donations to the GOP.\n\nThink about it. Do you know a small business owner? I know hundreds of them. Their rates are being doubled, tripled and quadrupled by ObamaCare.\n\nGuess who writes 75% of the checks to Republican candidates and conservative causes? Small Business.\n\nEven if a small business owner manages to survive, he or she certainly can\u2019t write a big check to the GOP anymore. Money is the \u201cmother\u2019s milk\u201d of politics. Without donations, a political party ceases to exist. Bingo.\n\nThat\u2019s the point of ObamaCare. Obama is bankrupting his political opposition and drying up donations to the GOP. Brilliant.\n\n5. ObamaCare is intended to make the IRS all-powerful.\n\nIt adds thousands of new IRS agents. It puts the IRS in charge of overseeing 15% of the U.S. economy. The IRS has the right because of ObamaCare to snoop into every aspect of your life, to go into your bank accounts, to fine you, to frighten you, to intimidate you. And Obama and his socialist cabal have access to your deepest medical secrets.\n\nBy law your doctor has to ask your sexual history. That information is now in the hands of Obama and the IRS to blackmail GOP candidates into either not running, or supporting bigger government, or leaking the info and ruining your campaign.\n\nOr have you forgotten the IRS harassed, intimidated and persecuted critics of Obama and conservative groups?\n\nNow Obama hands the IRS even more power. Big Brother rules our lives. Brilliant.\n\n6. ObamaCare is intended to unionize 15 million healthcare workers.\n\nThat produces $15 billion in new union dues. That money goes to fund Democratic candidates and socialist causes -- thereby guaranteeing Obama\u2019s friends never lose another election, and Obama\u2019s policies keep ruining capitalism and bankrupting business owners long after he\u2019s out of office.\n\nMessage to the GOP: This isn\u2019t a game. This isn\u2019t tiddly-winks. This is a serious, purposeful attempt to highjack America and destroy capitalism.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a trainwreck. It's purposeful suicide.\n\nIt's not failing, it's working exactly according to plan. Obama knows what he\u2019s doing. Stop apologizing and start fighting.\n\nOh and one more thing\u2026Conservatives aren\u2019t \u201cterrorists.\u201d We are patriots and saviors. We represent the Constitution and the Founding Fathers. We are the heroes and good guys. Unless you get all this through your thick skulls, America is lost\u2026forever.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.modified": "2015-01-07 09:07:16 EST", "dcterms.abstract": "There are 2 major political parties in America.
