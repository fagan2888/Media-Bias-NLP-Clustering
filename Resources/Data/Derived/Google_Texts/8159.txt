But, the Fox News host and author said, don’t count him among the conservatives criticizing Bush’s position.

“You have to be compassionate. There are some bad illegal aliens, and they should be out of here in a heartbeat, all right? But most of the people are good people,” O’Reilly said. “That doesn’t mean you give them amnesty. It means you treat them fairly. And surely a great nation like America can come up with an immigration plan that’s fair. Surely we can do that.”

O’Reilly was on “Today” promoting his book, “Killing Jesus,” and arguing that the story of Jesus and Christianity should be taught in public schools.
