A four-month investigation into a University of Kansas professor who used a racial slur in class has concluded it was used in an educational context and not intended as racist.

The Lawrence Journal-World reports assistant communication studies professor Andrea Quenette was notified late Friday by the university's Office of Institutional Opportunity and Access that she did not violate school policies.

Quenette used the slur a day after a heated university-wide town hall forum on race. The teacher noted that unlike other campuses where there had been highly racist acts, she hadn't see the slur spray painted on walls at KU.

A group of eight graduate students filed a discrimination complaint because of her use of the word and Quenette was put on paid leave while the university investigated.
