A man was taken to the hospital early Sunday, Feb. 28 for treatment of non-life-threatening injuries after he was shot in the parking lot at O'Malleys Bar and Grill, 247 N. Fourth Ave.

Detectives are still investigating the incident, which happened around 1:30 a.m., according to Tucson Police Department Sgt. Kimberly Bay, a department spokeswoman.

Few details were immediately available, but some kind of argument or altercation broke out in the parking lot, resulting in the man being shot and taken to the hospital, Bay said.

Police have no suspects and nobody in custody.
