Howell was joined by most of the Republican House caucus as they talked about the budget standoff. (Steve Helber/AP)\n\nVirginia Republicans were supposed to be squirming by now. For months, their opposition to expanding Medi\u00adcaid under the Affordable Care Act has put them at odds with some traditional allies in the business world.\n\nHospitals, the state chamber of commerce and corporate leaders have been calling, writing, visiting and buttonholing, pushing what they call \u201cthe business case\u201d for expanding coverage to thousands of uninsured under the health-care law, with the federal government promising to pay most of the cost. Gov. Terry McAuliffe and other Democrats who favor expansion have been betting on that pressure to sway Republicans, particularly in rural areas where hospitals are often the largest employer and are \u00adeager for the financial girding that the coverage expansion would provide.\n\nBut the hard sell has flopped, at least so far. Just one legislator has budged on Medicaid since the year began, and that was an expansion supporter who backed off a bit.\n\nRepublicans in this once reliably red state can ill afford to lose friends as the party seeks to rebuild a brand that lost back-to-back presidential elections and all three statewide elected offices last fall.\n\nBut in this case, a wide coalition of Republicans \u2014 state, national, moderate, conservative \u2014 sees a path forward in the Medi\u00adcaid fight, even as it pits them against some longtime friends.\n\nThe GOP\u2019s strategy in Virginia is an expression of the anti-Obamacare rallying cry the party is deploying nationwide, one that in March helped Republicans win a special congressional election in a swing district near Tampa. The party believes the Affordable Care Act, with its disastrous rollout and persistent problems, will be its greatest weapon in the fall midterm elections. Ed Gillespie, the GOP front-runner to challenge Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), has focused his campaign on Warner\u2019s support for the law.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely very potent,\u201d said Michael Short, spokesman for the Republican National Committee. \u201cWe feel absolutely it\u2019s very much a winning issue.\u201d\n\nThat may be true in the short term; even some Democrats think Republicans have the upper hand in the expansion debate, and they are wondering with increasing urgency what Mc\u00adAuliffe\u2019s exit strategy will be in the showdown, which could shutter state government if it is not resolved before July 1.\n\nBut some of these same Democrats think the anti-Obamacare strategy will ultimately backfire on Republicans as memories of the program\u2019s disastrous early months fade and more people enroll and begin enjoying the benefits.\n\n\u201cSeven million people signed up,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Richard L. Saslaw (D-Fairfax) said. Federal officials \u201cobviously got it fixed.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cSome feel this is their way of giving the finger to the president and the ACA. They\u2019re whistling past the graveyard.\u201d\n\nRepublicans may not have a choice. Opposition to the health-care law \u2014 and to the subcategory of Medicaid expansion \u2014 has unified the party like no other issue in recent memory. Just a year ago, the Virginia GOP splintered over a transportation-funding deal that imposed a huge tax increase. Rifts between the GOP\u2019s establishment and tea party wings were on full display then, when nearly half of House Republicans bucked their own governor and speaker to vote against the plan.\n\nInstead of exacerbating tensions within the often-fractious party, Medicaid seems to have smoothed them over in the GOP-dominated House and among Republicans generally.\n\n\u201cThis has been the number one unifier,\u201d said Pete Snyder, a Northern Virginia entrepreneur and Republican activist who sought the nomination for lieutenant governor last year. \u201cYou think just a year ago it [the House] was rife with strife over the tax increases. And now you have a House solidly aligned against the expansion of Obamacare and Medicaid expansion.\u201d\n\nThe strategy carries potential financial risk for Republicans. The Virginia GOP staggered out of the fall elections with less than $70,000 on hand. Some of the business groups and corporate leaders pushing for a version of Medicaid expansion are among the GOP\u2019s most reliable donors, according to the Virginia Public Access Project, a nonpartisan tracker of money in politics.\n\nThey include Richmond hotelier William H. Goodwin Jr., who has given more than $1 million to Republicans in the past 20 years; the Virginia Chamber of Commerce, which has made $175,000 in donations in the past 10 years, with 78 percent of that going to Republican candidates or committees; and Cheryl P. McLeskey, a Virginia Beach developer who has given $140,250 to Republicans since 1997 and $13,000 in that time to Democrats.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very difficult position for Republicans to navigate, but right now . . . I don\u2019t see them retreating,\u201d said former lieutenant governor Bill Bolling, a Republican who has supported expansion.\n\nOne reason Republicans have been able to withstand the pressure: Many business leaders who are pushing for expansion don\u2019t entirely disagree with the GOP. They are often critics of the ACA and the traditional Medicaid program, which already consumes nearly 25 percent of the state budget. They continue to rail against the health-care law even as they push to expand Medicaid under the law. And they call for expansion in a way that at least purports to keep traditional Medicaid at arm\u2019s length: a \u201cprivate option\u201d plan called Marketplace Virginia that uses the Medicaid money to buy private insurance for enrollees.\n\nThose business leaders take a pragmatic view: As long as the ACA is the law of the land, and Virginians are paying higher taxes to bankroll it, they\u2019d like the state to accept the $5 million a day in Medicaid money that Washington is offering for expansion. But they are not likely to hold grudges against Republicans who oppose both the ACA and expansion, said a lobbyist for several groups supporting expansion, who spoke on condition of anonymity in order to discuss clients\u2019 private thinking.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m no fan of Obamacare. I thought it was a terrible bill,\u201d said W. Sheppard Miller III, chairman of the Hampton Roads defense contractor KITCO Fiber Optics, who backs Marketplace Virginia. \u201cNobody knew what they were voting on when they passed it. But it is what it is. They are taking money out of my pocket and my employees\u2019 pockets. We\u2019re sending it to Washington. . . . I\u2019m not supporting Medi\u00adcaid expansion. What I\u2019m supporting is taking taxes back we paid and lowering the cost of health care.\u201d\n\nRepublicans say the pressure is mostly limited to hospital groups, not the average Main Street business owner. The National Federation of Independent Businesses, which represents the interests of small business, has opposed expansion. The influential Northern Virginia Technology Council has not weighed in. And the Virginia Chamber of Commerce has zigged and zagged, supporting the marketplace plan, then opposing Mc\u00adAuliffe\u2019s brief bid to revert to traditional Medicaid expansion. The group also has urged passage of a timely state budget, knowing Medicaid was the main sticking point in that impasse.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like there\u2019s a groundswell of business or traditional allies calling up. All we\u2019re hearing from is the hospital people and MoveOn.org people,\u201d said House Speaker William J. Howell (R-Stafford). MoveOn.org is a liberal advocacy group.\n\n\u201cI think everybody who works for my hospital back home wrote me a letter \u2014 the same form letter,\u201d Howell said.\n\nThat is not to say Republicans have found it easy to rebuff local hospitals, which the House tried to appease with an extra $118 million in its budget plan. But opponents think the federal government is so overextended that it cannot keep its promise to pick up most of the cost of expansion, potentially leaving Virginia on the hook for the $2 billion-a-year tab.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve all got discomfort,\u201d said Sen. Mark D. Obenshain (R-Harrisonburg), who opposes expansion. \u201cI understand the predicament the hospitals are in. I simply believe this is the wrong way to fix it.\u201d\n\nThe debate has hardly registered with average Virginians, although that will surely change if the impasse drags on long enough to cause a government shutdown. Only 4 percent of the state\u2019s voters ranked health care a top priority in a recent Quinnipiac University poll.\n\nThose in favor of expanding Medicaid to as many as 400,000 low-income Virginians think the Republican caucus will eventually feel the pressure and splinter.\n\n\u201cNo doubt in my mind, eventually they\u2019ll move,\u201d said Saslaw, the Senate majority leader.\n\nDemocrats have suggested all along that some Republicans would like to vote for expansion but are wary of primary challenges back home and of crossing Howell, who can reward allies with key committee assignments and campaign funds. Howell and other House leaders have said delegates are free to vote their conscience.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of people who want this to go away and want it to go away without having to vote on it,\u201d House Minority Leader David J. Toscano (D-Charlottesville) said. \u201cWhile you might not see it outwardly right now, there are people who continue to hear the business argument and hear from their constituents and are a little uncomfortable.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Although expansion of coverage is backed by some important donors, GOP lawmakers maintain opposition.", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/laura.vozzella", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Although expansion of coverage is backed by some important donors, GOP lawmakers maintain opposition.", "title": "Va.
