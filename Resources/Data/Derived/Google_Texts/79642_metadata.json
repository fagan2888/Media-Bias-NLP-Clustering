In a nutshell, the proposed legislation would attempt to reform the way medical malpractice litigation is handled in Georgia. Instead of a jury trial, a new Patient Compensation System and an accompanying Patient Compensation Board would determine payouts when a doctor makes a mistake.\n\nThis post isn\u2019t going to debate the pros and cons of the legislation. Instead, it will document how money and influence are trying to get the bill passed.\n\nBecause the Patient Injury Act, also known as the Patient Compensation Act, affects several high-powered groups, including doctors, trial lawyers and insurance companies, there is lots of behind the scenes activity going on.\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s start with an organization known as Patients for Fair Compensation. This nonpartisan Section 501(c)(4) group appears to be the brains behind the Patient Injury Act. Their website features a section describing the effort to implement a patients\u2019 compensation system in Georgia.\n\nWho runs Patients for Fair Compensation? Its chairman is Richard L. Jackson, the Chair and CEO of Alpharetta based Jackson Healthcare. The company provides temporary staffing, including physicians and other allied health professionals, to hospitals. Mr. Jackson is also on the Board of Directors of the Georgia Department of Community Health and the Metro Atlanta Chamber.\n\nIn addition to Patients for Fair Compensation, there are at least two other websites supporting SB 141. Georgia\u2019s Patients Compensation System claims to be run by \u2018Taxpayers for a Healthy Georgia.\u2019 On the site, they are described as \u201ca grassroots organization committed to replacing our broken health care system, lowering costs for patients and ensuring timely compensation for injured patients.\u201d\n\nAnother site, Doctors for A Healthy Georgia, also touts the benefits of the plan proposed by Patients for Fair Compensation. It features testimonials from Georgia physicians about the plan\u2019s benefits, and urges visitors to call the state legislature and the Medical Association of Georgia to register their support.\n\nThe domains fixmyhealthcare.com and ahealthygeorgia.com are registered to The Stoneridge Group, an Alpharetta firm known for running digital and direct mail campaigns for Republican candidates.\n\nLast week, some Georgia residents received glossy mailers promoting Senate Bill 141, and urging the recipient to call their State Senator to find out where he or she stands on the bill. The mailer tells the reader to \u201clearn more at fixmyhealthcare.com,\u201d and includes a tear-off business reply postcard for the recipient to send their contact information to Taxpayers for a Healthy Georgia. The postcard is addressed to a Gainesville post office box.\n\nAnd where did the mailer come from? The return address is 2655 Northwinds Parkway in Alpharetta. And at that address you will find the headquarters of Jackson Healthcare.\n\nTarget: Senator Josh McKoon\n\nJosh McKoon represents Senate District 29, which runs along the western border of Georgia, from LaGrange south to Columbus. He is chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and has his own law practice, Crowley McKoon.\n\nOn January 22nd, Patients for Fair Compensation sponsored a radio advertisement promoting the Patient Injury Act. It aired in the Columbus market. The spot claims Senator McKoon wasn\u2019t supporting the bill because he is a personal injury lawyer who wants to protect his fellow attorneys and the insurance companies. From the ad:\n\nWhat type of Republican would put personal injury lawyers ahead of these conservative reforms?\n\nState Senator Josh McKoon. Because Josh McKoon is a personal injury lawyer.\n\n\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s a sad day when Josh McKoon puts personal injury lawyers and greedy insurance companies before you.\n\nYou can listen to it below.\n\nhttp://www.peachpundit.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/McKoon-Ad.mp3\n\nSenator McKoon responded by sending an email to his campaign supporters, explaining why he felt he couldn\u2019t support the bill. He also posted his position on Facebook.\n\nOver the weekend of January 25th, residents of District 29 opened their mailboxes to find this mailer, which says:\n\nJosh McKoon funded his campaign with thousands of dollar [sic] from the trial lawyers and liberal special interests. Now he opposes the Patients\u2019 Compensation Act \u2014 which lowers healthcare costs by getting lawyers out of medicine. That\u2019s just WRONG. We can\u2019t afford a Senator who puts the interests of trial lawyers above those of Georgia families.\n\nWhile no sponsoring organization or website is listed on the McKoon mailer, the Northwinds Parkway return address matches that of the other mailers\u2013Jackson Healthcare.\n\nThe Sunday, January 26th edition of the Columbus Ledger-Enquirer contains a full page ad paid for by Patients for Fair Compensation. It targets Senator McKoon. The ad claims:\n\nSenator McKoon is working to stop legislation that would reform the medical liability system, lower healthcare costs, and stop frivolous malpractice lawsuits in Georgia. Why would so-called conservative Senator Josh McKoon oppose this legislation? Greed.\n\nClick the image at right to view a larger version of the ad.\n\nWhy target Senator McKoon with a radio ad, a mail piece and a full page newspaper ad? The committee he chairs doesn\u2019t have initial jurisdiction over the Patient Injury Act. Could it be because he was one of the first to speak out against it?\n\nState Rep. John Pezold, whose District 133 shares many of the same constituents as McKoon\u2019s, took to Facebook to complain.\n\nApparently one of the few people actually supporting this bill is the guy who stands to make the most cash if it passes\u2026the same guy who (you guessed it), has shelled out money for radio ads and mailers attempting to sully Josh\u2019s reputation. Don\u2019t fall for this garbage.\n\nHe also expressed his frustration on Twitter.\n\nJust out of sheer principle, I will #opposeSB141. Somebody needs a timeout. @JoshMcKoon \u2014 John Pezold (@johnpezold) January 26, 2014\n\nThe 60 Plus Association Gets Involved\n\nAnother organization appears to be working to steer Senate Bill 141 towards passage. Last fall, the 60 Plus Association began a campaign to get state lawmakers to go on the record in opposition to trial lawyers. The association sent a letter to Georgia Representatives and Senators, asking them to sign a pledge \u201caffirming your opposition to policy goals of the Trial Lawyers,\u201d and promising to publicize the results.\n\nThe Sunday January 19th Gwinnett Daily Post featured a full page advertisement with color pictures of President Obama and Senate President Pro-Tem David Shafer, claiming both took money from trial lawyers. Other legislators, including House Speaker David Ralston, were mentioned in similar ads, all paid for by the 60 Plus Association.\n\nThe 60 Plus Association was formed in 1992, and is a non-partisan seniors advocacy group, according to its website. They claim they are the conservative alternative to the AARP. Yet, some of the legislators who are the targets of the anti-trial lawyer ads think there might be a link between those supporting Senate Bill 141 and the campaign by 60Plus.\n\nDespite the similar tactics of opposing the interests of trial lawyers, there appears to be no visible connection between 60 Plus and Patients for Fair Compensation.\n\nWho Is Really Pulling the Strings?\n\nWhy are Richard Jackson and Jackson Healthcare so interested in reforming the way medical malpractice suits are handled? As mentioned above, the company is in the business of providing doctors and other health professionals to hospitals on a temporary basis. One possible reason is because when a malpractice suit is filed, plaintiffs cast as wide a net as they can, including the hospital, the doctors, the nurses, and more as defendants, depending on the nature of the case. When one of the team members is a temp, he or she tends to get blamed, and that could be the reason to push for changes that would lower damages from malpractice suits.\n\nThe Jacksons have also been making political contributions. On October 2nd, Richard Jackson and R. Shane Jackson each maxed out their contributions to Lt. Governor Casey Cagle, with $6,300 for the primary election, and $6,300 for the general election. Chad Jackson contributed $1,000 to Cagle\u2019s campaign.\n\nOne week later, on October 9th, Richard Jackson contributed the maximum of $2,500 to both the primary and runoff campaigns of Senator Brandon Beach. Shane Jackson and Chad Jackson each gave $2,500 towards Beach\u2019s Primary campaign. Senator Beach, by the way, is the sponsor of Senate Bill 141.\n\nOn October 13th, Richard, Shane and Chad Jackson each contributed $12,600 to Governor Nathan Deal\u2019s campaign \u2014 $6,300 for the primary and $6,300 for the general election. And on October 16th, Richard Jackson contributed the maximum $6,300 to Attorney General Sam Olens\u2019 primary campaign.\n\nThe total? $80,300 from people employed by Jackson Healthcare and its affiliates. According to the Ethics Commission website, the only political contribution by any one of these three people prior to October 2013 was a $250 contribution made by Shane Jackson to Beach\u2019s campaign in 2010.\n\nRichard Jackson is also sponsoring a breakfast with Governor and Mrs. Deal for the Fulton County Republican Party next month.\n\nEverything done by Patients for Fair Compensation, Richard Jackson and Jackson Healthcare, and the 60Plus Association is perfectly legal. People and companies have the right, within the law, to promote their interests.\n\nBut, it\u2019s equally important for voters and elected officials to understand who is really pulling the strings. And, with its ads blaming trial lawyers and greedy insurance companies for the lack of progress on Senate Bill 141, it appears there is one special interest that really, really wants to get that piece of legislation passed.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Peach Pundit", "description": "Last week, Peach Pundit featured posts supporting and opposing Senate Bill 141, the Patient Injury Act.
