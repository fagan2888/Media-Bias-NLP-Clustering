The Obama administration says six million people have gained Medicaid coverage. But there may be nearly two million waiting for their applications to be processed.\n\nJulie Rovner, who is now with Kaiser Health News, joins us now.\n\nAnd welcome back to the program, Julie.\n\nJULIE ROVNER, Kaiser Health News: Nice to be here.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: So, why have some states still not made a decision about whether to expand Medicaid?\n\nJULIE ROVNER: Well, of course, they don\u2019t have to. In 2012, the Supreme Court said that this was optional. This, of course, was not going to be optional as the health law was passed.\n\nThe health law expected and anticipated that every state would expand Medicaid. Congress of course knew when it passed the law in 2010 that states didn\u2019t have a lot of extra money lying around to help pay for Medicaid, which is of course a shared program between federal and state governments. Basically, the federal government pays a little more than half of the cost for it.\n\nBut the federal government said that for this expansion population, they would pay 100 percent of the cost for the first three years and it would phase down to 90 percent, so it would still be most of the cost going into perpetuity, but when the Supreme Court made it optional, half the states, as you pointed out, jumped in, and the other half, most of them Republican states, have said, we don\u2019t even know if we can afford that 10 percent that we would have to kick in after the three years, when it\u2019s going to be, you know, fully federally funded.\n\nSo, they\u2019re still arguing about in the states.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: And as we were just pointing out, in one of these states where it\u2019s on the cusp, they\u2019re trying to figure out what to do, Virginia, with a new Republican governor, having had\u2026\n\nJULIE ROVNER: A new Democratic governor.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: I\u2019m sorry, a new Democratic governor, having had a Republican governor \u2014 the state legislature, state Senate, now has this switch, a very unusual situation there.\n\nJULIE ROVNER: Yes.\n\nWell, of course, the new Democratic governor ran with this as his number one priority to expand Medicaid, and, of course, it\u2019s a Republican House, and it was a split. The Senate, it was 50/50, with, of course, the lieutenant governor being the deciding vote. So this one resignation by this state senator has slipped the state Senate to the Republicans.\n\nAnd basically there\u2019s this budget standoff. And it could have \u2014 it was thinking that it was going to close \u2014 shut down the state over the budget. Now, of course, it looks like the budget will not have the Medicaid expansion it in, much to the dismay of the Democratic governor.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Terry McAuliffe.\n\nJULIE ROVNER: There is still a possibility \u2014 that\u2019s right. There is still a possibility that there could be a special session, that Medicaid could come back.\n\nThere are a couple of moderate Republicans in the Senate who do support the Medicaid expansion, but certainly it puts it in much more doubt, just with this one expected and unknown-why resignation.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: But when \u2014 but then you have, Julie, these other states that are trying to figure out, Republican governors, Utah, Pennsylvania, Indiana, just to name a few of them, politics peculiar to each state in play in every one.\n\nJULIE ROVNER: Yes, and we\u2019re starting to see kind of a theme with these Republican governors who would like the federal money.\n\nIt\u2019s a lot of money for a large uninsured population in many of the states. Pennsylvania has perhaps 400,000 people who could be covered. And what many of these Republican governors are doing \u2014 we have seen this in Iowa already \u2014 is they\u2019re saying, OK, we want to expand Medicaid, but we want to do it our way. So we want to have perhaps these people go into private plans. We have already seen that in Arkansas.\n\nWe want to have these people perhaps pay a little bit more in cost sharing, so have this low-income population pay something for their coverage. That\u2019s not traditionally been allowed in Medicaid. And we want to have perhaps incentives for them to have \u2014 do healthy behaviors, maybe stop smoking or lose weight.\n\nSo those tend to be the kinds of things they\u2019re asking for, and they haven\u2019t necessarily got that yet from the federal government.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: And what is the pushback that you\u2019re hearing from advocates for the poor, who say even a small amount that some of these folks are required to pay can prevent them from having access?\n\nJULIE ROVNER: Well, there\u2019s a large body of research that suggests that cost sharing does deter people from getting care and it particularly deters poor people from getting care. And there\u2019s a concern that if \u2014 that even if you put small amounts of cost sharing on, that people who need care, particularly people with chronic ailments, won\u2019t get that care, so it can be counterproductive\n\nAnd they\u2019re very concerned about the idea of having \u2014 quote, unquote \u2014 \u201cskin in the game\u201d for the Medicaid population in particular.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: So while those dramas play out and with very real consequences, just quickly, Julie, this notion that there are several million people who have applied for Medicaid don\u2019t have their applications responded to yet.\n\nJULIE ROVNER: That\u2019s right. And this is partly because in putting in the Affordable Care Act, every state had to change the way it calculated eligibility for the Medicaid population.\n\nThis was to basically make it standardized across all of the states. And so basically, as of January 1, every state had to change the way it calculated eligibility. Also, there was some difficulty in healthcare.gov, the Web site, reporting \u2014 basically sending the information to the states and getting it back and forth.\n\nSo there is this backlog. Most of it turns out to be in California and Illinois, two big states. This was some work done by my Kaiser Health News colleague Phil Galewitz. But there\u2019s also a backlog, it turns out, in some states that didn\u2019t expand Medicaid, states like North Carolina, and Georgia. Hopefully, just over the next few weeks, as these states get their I.T. problems straightened out, the backlog will dissipate, if not go away.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Julie Rovner, always on top of it, thank you very much.\n\nJULIE ROVNER: Thank you.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Battles over whether to expand Medicaid under the federal health care law are still being waged.
