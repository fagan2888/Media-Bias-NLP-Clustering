Many want to see a cap on wages for tipped workers. Read Nick Miller's April 2015 cover story on the minimum wage here: http://tinyurl.com/SactoMinimumWage Advertisement\n\n\n\nZocalo is one of Midtown\u2019s most hopping restaurants. You\u2019ve probably seen the lively patio on Saturday nights, with the servers ushering margaritas and nonstop baskets of chips, and the ever-churning salsa music. It\u2019s a scene. But at the end of the shift, things calm down and Zocalo servers count out their tips, just like tens of thousands of other restaurant workers in the Sacramento area. Some of these servers earn $35 an hour between their base wage and gratuity\u2014and more\n\nAnd, lucky them, it looks like they might be getting a big raise this year.\n\nLast week, the state Senate passed a bill that would up California\u2019s minimum wage to $13 an hour (it\u2019s currently at $9, but goes to $10 in January 2016). That proposed law, Senate Bill 3, has yet to make it to Gov. Jerry Brown\u2019s desk for final approval. But it has momentum.\n\nMeanwhile, a few blocks away at City Hall, Mayor Kevin Johnson will soon unveil a task force that will explore raising the city\u2019s minimum wage, perhaps as high as $15 an hour. That\u2019s a 60 percent jump over the current rate.\n\nThe prospect of payroll shooting to unprecedented heights has restaurant owners like Jimmy Johnson concerned.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re already thinking about it. We see it coming down the pipe already,\u201d said Johnson, who runs the show at Zocalo. He explained that, between looming wage increases and new health-care requirements, because of the Affordable Care Act, there\u2019s a \u201cdouble whammy\u201d poised to wreak havoc on California restaurants\u2019 bottom lines.\n\n\u201cAnd that really, really hurts. We\u2019re terrified,\u201d Johnson admitted.\n\nConsider: For every dollar increase in wages, he says Zocalo incurs an extra $1,000 in payroll costs. Each week.\n\n\u201cAny increase in labor costs for restaurant owners \u2026 can have devastating impacts,\u201d explained Jot Condie, president and CEO of the California Restaurant Association, an advocacy group. \u201cSuch a drastic increase would force many to raise prices, cut hours and jobs, and in some cases, close their doors,\u201d he wrote in an email.\n\nPhil Courey is worried about how he would keep his business open if wages go up. The owner of Opa! Opa! in East Sacramento used the same word as Condie to describe a minimum-wage increase, and its singular impact on his micro-business: \u201cdevastating.\u201d\n\nCourey employs 21 workers, all of them earning some kind of tips. He says that if the minimum wage ticks higher at mom-and-pop restaurants like his\u2014which make up half of all the restaurants in California\u2014we\u2019re going to see a lot less of them.\n\nBut he\u2019s convinced that the Legislature, and even the CRA, don\u2019t care about his brand of small businesses, places that own only one location.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re in bed with the Chipotles and the Starbucks,\u201d he argued. He thinks that wage increases at micro-businesses will lead to higher costs for food, and customers will flock to corporate chains, which are better suited to absorb significant payroll costs.\n\n\u201cThat food dollar will migrate to an increased dollar share for the corporate food chains,\u201d he said. Courey is also prepared to sue the city of Sacramento, in a class action on behalf of the independent operators.\n\nRestaurant owners like Courey and the CRA do agree on some issues, such as capping wages for tipped employees, as is done in 43 other states across the nation.\n\nIn Texas, for instance, servers who earn at least $30 a month in tips only need to be paid $2.13 per hour. That\u2019s a super-low wage compared to New York, where this cap on tipped wages is slated to go up to $7.50 an hour, from $5.\n\nWithout a cap, the choices for restaurateurs are a dire, they say.\n\n\u201cYou either have to raise prices, or you have to cut employees,\u201d Johnson explained. \u201cI\u2019m not even sure the servers like\u201d the proposed wage increases, he added, because it could cost them hours\u2014or their job.\n\nThere are hundreds of restaurants in the Sacramento area, and more than 450 are members of the CRA, which estimates some 1.6 million restaurant employees in the entire state. Profit margins are infamously slim at restaurants, so big changes in costs can be disruptive and worse.\n\nYet restaurants are up against a tsunami of national change. Last year, five states\u2014Alaska, Alabama, Illinois, South Dakota, Nebraska\u2014increased their minimum wages. San Francisco voters upped the city\u2019s minimum to $15 this past November, and Los Angeles recently voted for $15, as well. Even Wal-Mart and McDonald\u2019s have agreed to raise their wages.\n\nHere in Sacramento, Mayor Kevin Johnson has put increasing the minimum wage on his list of yearly goals.\n\nEconomists say they have little clue as to how these significant wage bumps will effect local businesses.\n\nAnn Huff Stevens, a UC Davis economics professor and director of the Center for Poverty Research, told SN&R earlier this year that \u201cwe know virtually nothing\u201d about how a $15 minimum wage would impact small businesses. \u201cWe really don\u2019t know, and so there\u2019s a risk,\u201d she said.\n\nThis is why the CRA prefers prolonged implementation of wage hikes, instead of quick jumps like what we\u2019ve seen in Los Angeles or San Francisco. This way, businesses have time to adjust to new payroll realities. The CRA also advocates for a \u201cteen wage,\u201d for entry-level workers.\n\n\u201cSuch measures are critical to the success of any minimum wage increase,\u201d Condie argued.\n\nA bill to cap the minimum wage in California for tipped employees stalled in the Assembly this year. This means that, in the city of Sacramento, higher wages at restaurants might very well be a reality this year.\n\nIs the $20 cheeseburger coming soon to a restaurant near you?\n\nRestaurateurs like Johnson say they\u2019ll have to somehow pass the increased operating costs on to customers.\n\n\u201cIf it goes up to $15, that really is a huge impact,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t absorb it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "description": "By Nick Miller.
