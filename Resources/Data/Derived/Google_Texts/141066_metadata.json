Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) that\u2019s designed to limit the activity of so-called patent trolls.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, this legislation goes well beyond what is needed to ensure that patent cases are not brought in perceived \u2018pro-plaintiff\u2019 judicial districts that lack any meaningful connection to the parties and claims involved in the action,\u201d the Coalition for 21st Century Patent Reform said Friday in an email statement.\n\nThe 43-member coalition includes companies such as General Electric Co., Dow Chemical Co. and Siemens AG.\n\nFlake (R-Ariz.) introduced his bill, S.2733, last month. The measure would require an entity filing a patent lawsuit to sue in the same district as the defendant\u2019s main business operations, part of an effort to prevent firms from \u201cforum-shopping,\u201d whereby companies file lawsuits in courts they think will be friendly to them.\n\nThe legislation has garnered support from the Computer & Communications Industry Association and the Consumer Technology Association.\n\nThe 21st Century Patent Reform coalition said the measure would hurt patent owners because it \u201cmay force them to bring suit in the infringer\u2019s home court or in far-flung districts where they happen to have R&D or manufacturing facilities.\u201d\n\nInstead, the coalition called for the passage of more comprehensive patent legislation \u201calong the lines of\u201d S. 1137, though with some changes to that measure. The Senate Judiciary Committee approved S.1137, a much broader patent overhaul bill, in June on a 16-4 vote.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/icons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "Morning Consult", "description": "A coalition of businesses that wants changes to the patent system said it \u201cstrongly opposes\u201d a bill introduced by Sen.
