(AP) \u2014 Since at least 1976, Pueblo Rape Crisis Services has been around to advocate for and support victims of sexual assault.\n\nWhile PRCS officially became a nonprofit in 2001, officials said they recently discovered a PRCS letter at its offices that dates back to 1976. It was a discovery that came as a big surprise.\n\n\u201cThe bigger picture of the history goes back farther than people realize, including us,\u201d said Kristi Roque, the director of PRCS. \u201cWe don\u2019t know who formed it then. We just know now that Pueblo Rape Crisis Services has existed since at least 1976. If whoever ran it then is out there, we\u2019d love to hear from them.\u201d\n\nThe letter that was discovered was one advertising an open house for PRCS on April 28, 1976.\n\nThe letter also mentioned the formation of a \u201cfriends\u201d group for the center.\n\n\u201cOur goal is one of support. We want to express an interest in the continued existence of the center, support the staff in their activities and become aware of the community\u2019s role in preventing sexual assaults. The center offers direct victim assistance, community outreach programs, research and information dissemination and other services aimed at reducing the number of sexual assaults in Pueblo County,\u201d the letter read.\n\nWhile it appears some of the core services of the PRCS were around in 1976, the agency has no doubt morphed through the years into what it is today.\n\nIn 2014, PRCS served 159 primary victims (someone who is directly affected by sexual violence) and served 487 total victims, including the 159 primary victims, hotline calls and secondary victims (loved ones seeking ways to support someone who has been through sexual violence).\n\nSupporting and empowering survivors\n\nPueblo Rape Crisis Services\u2019 mission is to empower sexual assault survivors, provide victims advocacy and build community awareness to reduce sexual violence. The agency\u2019s vision is a community free of sexual violence.\n\nPRCS currently has 12 volunteer victim advocates who are available 24 hours a day.\n\nRoque said the agency would ideally like to have about 20 to 25 volunteers.\n\nThe volunteers are available to take calls on the center\u2019s 24/7 confidential hotline and are available to respond to hospitals at all hours of the day to provide victim advocacy and support to survivors of sexual assault.\n\nThe center also offers case management services to provide many types of immediate and long-term assistance to the victims of sexual assault and an eight-week survivor support group.\n\n\u201cWe ask for volunteer support all hours of the day to respond to hotline calls. That could be a survivor calling in, a loved one calling in maybe seeking ways they can help support their loved one that\u2019s experienced sexual violence and then our advocates also respond to the hospital 24/7,\u201d said Niki Sosa, a volunteer coordinator and outreach coordinator for PRCS. \u201cSo when a sexual assault comes into Parkview, we\u2019ll have an advocate that goes and responds to let them know about their rights, talk to them about the process of going through a SANE (sexual assault nurse examiner) exam, reporting to law enforcement and really just be that support piece for them through a very difficult time that can be very scary, especially at the hospital.\u201d\n\nAll volunteer victim advocates go through an application process, interview and 35 hours of training.\n\nA lot is covered during the training, including having guest speakers come in and talk to volunteers, but a lot of it has to do with how to offer support to someone who has just been through such a tragic experience.\n\nSosa said how to approach each victim varies on a case by case basis.\n\n\u201cWe serve children, men and all ages and backgrounds so when we do respond we\u2019re walking into a room and introducing ourselves as advocates and letting them know our role there is to support them and help make sure that they are feeling empowered to make whatever decision they want to,\u201d Sosa said. \u201cThere have been a lot of times we\u2019ve been to the hospital and it\u2019s been very emotionally charged with whoever is in there and so it\u2019s just really being empathetic, compassionate and not taking their power away and letting them be OK with what they\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nChallenges and rewards\n\nProviding support to sexual assault victims is rewarding, but it can also be challenging.\n\nAdvocates are seeing the victims after a tragic experience that is often times the worst moment of their lives.\n\nRoque said one of the toughest parts of the job for her is thinking about how someone could do something as awful as sexual assault to another person.\n\n\u201cSexual violence for me is such a despicable crime, it\u2019s awful, and for me what\u2019s challenging is to have to wrap my mind around the fact that somebody would do this to another person. It\u2019s hard sometimes,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone to the hospital or have had hotline calls, and it\u2019s really hard to understand how another person could do something so horrible. And keeping in mind, too, that oftentimes the perpetrator is somebody that\u2019s known to them so not only are they doing this awful, despicable thing they\u2019re doing it to somebody they know and that otherwise would claim they love and care about.\u201d\n\nFor Kaci Garcia, a case manager and outreach coordinator, seeing child victims is difficult.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a sensitive area for me,\u201d she said.\n\nSosa said the realization that victims will have to deal with what they\u2019ve been through the rest of their life is tough.\n\n\u201cWith the case management that we do and long-term follow up, we see that\u2019s it\u2019s not just that night at the hospital, it\u2019s not just that call to the hotline, it\u2019s continuous,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s weeks, months, years out of their lives afterwards that they\u2019re dealing with this.\u201d\n\nDespite that, the job can be rewarding.\n\nSosa said those moments in which she realizes the agency has made a difference in someone\u2019s life is one of those rewards.\n\n\u201cThere are moments speaking with clients when I\u2019ll hear it in their voice and they\u2019ll just make mention of kind of a big moment that they have in being able to move forward,\u201d she said. \u201cNot saying everything is put behind them and they\u2019re able to live like they used to live, but they just have a moment where they say, \u2018Well, if I didn\u2019t have this intervention with this agency I might be in a worse place\u2019 so there\u2019s some moments like that that are very rewarding and I appreciate.\u201d\n\nSosa said seeing volunteers give their time to the cause is also rewarding.\n\n\u201cI really do appreciate them and all the time that they give us and that\u2019s a big deal for me,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s really cool thinking that there are people out there that will volunteer their time to be on call at midnight to respond to the hospital. They\u2019re just very giving of themselves and I think it\u2019s really cool to see that kind of community support from volunteers.\u201d\n\nLaw officers appreciate efforts\n\nThe agency\u2019s work is an asset to local law enforcement officials who, when a sexual assault occurs, are devoted to investigating the case and making sure the victim is safe but don\u2019t necessarily have the resources to offer support and ongoing assistance to victims.\n\n\u201cI believe Pueblo Rape Crisis is an extremely valuable asset to not only the community but to local law enforcement. The services they provide fill a gap for us,\u201d said Sgt. James Olonia with the Pueblo Police Department. \u201cOur officers are tasked with investigating the criminal portion of these types of calls and they are also responsible for ensuring the victim\u2019s well-being. That being said, PRCS helps us with the second part of that by providing immediate crisis intervention the night of the incident. They additionally provide ongoing services for these victims.\u201d\n\nOlonia continued, \u201cThe police department is not equipped to handle this very critical part of the victim\u2019s recovery. I also believe their message to the community is encouraging, and it empowers other victims to come forward and report an incident they might have otherwise let go. We all know rape is underreported and the PRCS helps with the message. The staff is dedicated to working with local law enforcement to deliver the best service to victims. They do all of this on a very limited budget, and very small staff. PRCS is necessary in our community and they are definitely necessary to help us be more effective.\u201d\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nInformation from: The Pueblo Chieftain, http://www.chieftain.com", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Rape crisis center: 40 years of helping", "title": "Rape crisis center: 40 years of helping", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/11/29/rape-crisis-center-40-years-of-helping/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-29T08:22:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-29T08:22:27+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "PUEBLO, Colo.
