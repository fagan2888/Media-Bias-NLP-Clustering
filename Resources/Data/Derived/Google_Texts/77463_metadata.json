Israeli polling for its election of a prime minister in March never caught on to Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s ultimate victory. The latest Polish presidential polls appear to have missed the final surge of the challenger, who beat the incumbent president and forced a runoff.\n\nAnd here in the U.S., last November\u2019s election polls mostly identified the right winner in Senate races, but didn\u2019t pick up on the Republican landslides that occurred in numerous states.\n\nAlthough each of these misses can be explained, and polling in multiparty parliamentary elections is more fraught with challenges than America\u2019s mostly two-party races, the common theme tells of a new era for polling. At a time when polls have become more prolific and influential in the coverage of elections, the waves of new technology, voter behavior and campaign techniques are creating significant challenges to their accuracy.\n\nThe British election coverage included more than four months of reporting that, like the Western Front in the Great War, a stalemate was likely between two weak parties: Labour and Conservative. Eight credible polls \u2014 some telephone, some online \u2014 blended into a poll-of-polls that drove the stalemate narrative.\n\nStories on the type of coalition-building needed to construct a parliamentary majority were among the most frequent for weeks. On election eve, British media headlines uniformly proclaimed a version of \u201chung parliament, no party wins a majority.\u201d\n\nBut as the actual vote count became clear, the Conservative victory of 331 was so substantial that no coalition would be needed, and the shock contributed to the rapid resignation of the leaders of three disappointed parties: Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Independent Party.\n\nThe British polling profession is nearly as old and equally as respected as its American cousin. Britain\u2019s leading pollsters immediately began to speculate what went wrong. Even the respected American election poll guru, Nate Silver, who had published a final poll with a 34 percent Conservative to 33 percent Labour tie, called it a \u201ccrisis in polling.\u201d\n\nEarly diagnosis of the problem has centered on the complex model British pollsters use to translate public opinion into parliamentary seats, along with a version of the phenomena observed in previous elections when voters tell interviewers they are undecided or voting Labour and actually vote Conservative (Shy Tories). That, of course, should not have been a factor in various anonymous online polls.\n\nAll of the British polls, both telephone and online methods, failed. (Online polls are more accepted in Britain.) In addition, very late polls showed the same tie, ruling out a widespread surge at the end.\n\nWhat may be most distorting to final election polling accuracy is not a failure of data collection or the complex algorithms that guide the forecasts, but a change in the election environment that allows campaigns to target small groups of voters for maximum impact. Ironically, the campaigns employ the very media polls and narrative that they then make inaccurate.\n\nMore and more, the British utilize American advisers and campaign techniques for their elections. Jim Messina, President Obama\u2019s 2012 campaign manager, consulted for the Conservatives. Messina\u2019s approach is to use massive amounts of polling and other voter-related data (big data) to target a specific message at a selected set of voters and election districts. In America, those are targeted voters in swing states; in Britain, they are swing parliamentary seats.\n\nThe message Conservatives devised from the polling narrative targeted a subset of voters in England who were told that a Labour victory would put its natural allies, the Scottish National Party, in charge of Westminster. Prime Minister David Cameron called it a \u201chorror movie\u201d that would lead to the break up and bankruptcy of the country. The effort was not designed to move a mass of voters, but only a handful of populists and weakly attached voters in swing districts.\n\nNot only can national polls miss the new targeted campaigns, but misread those voters inclined toward a change of heart. Instead of their first choice, they were voting Conservative to stop something worse \u2014 a Scottish takeover.\n\nThere is already a surfeit of theories regarding the primary source of error in the case of the British polls. This theory suggests the main culprit is the confluence of the intense polling environment and the media narrative it creates engaged with the 2012 American-style campaigns that target subsets of swing voters. These motivated swing voters can quickly become a force, one that is especially illusive and confounding to pollsters.\n\nFloyd Ciruli, founder of Ciruli Associates, is a Denver-based pollster and political analyst.\n\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Ciruli: Election polls face a crisis of confidence", "title": "Ciruli: Election polls face a crisis of confidence", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/05/15/ciruli-election-polls-face-a-crisis-of-confidence/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-15T12:04:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-15T12:04:24+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "British polls tracking the May 7 parliamentary election significantly misreported the strength of the winner.\nThere is already a surfeit of theories regarding the primary source of error in the case of the British polls.\nAnd here in the U.S., last November\u2019s election polls mostly identified the right winner in Senate races, but didn\u2019t pick up on the Republican landslides that occurred in numerous states.\nThese motivated swing voters can quickly become a force, one that is especially illusive and confounding to pollsters.\nThat, of course, should not have been a factor in various anonymous online polls."}
