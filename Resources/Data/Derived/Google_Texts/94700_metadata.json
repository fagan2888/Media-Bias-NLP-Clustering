He has also suspended for one year the employer mandate of the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, so that businesses could have more time to effectively implement the law\u2019s requirements.\n\nHere are some of the most alarming statements made at an otherwise dry hearing:\n\nCongress Becomes Less Relevant\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nThere was some fear-mongering going on, as one expert expressed concern that unchecked presidential authority would weaken the legislative power.\n\nJonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University, told members of the committee that if one president unilaterally enforces laws, he will set a precedent for others to follow suit. He also said that with more federal agencies having increasing independence, and if the president\u2019s power should expand, \u201cCongress will be left like a Maginot Line on the constitutional landscape -- a sad relic of a once tripartite system of equal branches,\u201d Turley said.\n\nTurley later said, \u201cThis body is becoming less and less relevant.\u201d\n\nBut Democrats fired back, claiming that if Congress is seen as irrelevant it is because members are wasting time with such hearings rather than legislating.\n\nRep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, said the hearing equates to \u201crhetorical make-weights,\u201d borrowing from the testimony of Simon Lazarus, the senior counsel to the Constitutional Accountability Center.\n\n\u201cTo suggest that the reasons why this body may be on the verge of some basis of irrelevancy, which I take issue with, is because under the present House leadership we\u2019ve passed no legislation for the president to be able to implement in the first place,\u201d Jackson Lee said. She cited immigration reform, the budget, and sequester cuts among the issues Congress has failed to deal with.\n\n\u201cIf we would simply do our job, the relevance to the American people would exceed our expectation,\u201d she added. \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, the duty of the president is to be the ultimate giver of relief within the context of the Constitution and the necessary relief of the people who are begging for relief.\u201d\n\nThe 113th Congress is on track to be the least productive ever, passing only 55 laws so far this year, according to the New York Times.\n\n\u201cOnce again we are bloviating and not legislating in this Committee,\u201d Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., said. \u201cWe could be using this time to find common ground or even to have a strenuous and substantive debate on important public policy matters, but instead, we are offering empty assurances and shaping political messages for next fall. Rather than worrying about whether the president we know you distrust is enforcing our laws the way you would like him to, we could be making meaningful progress towards crafting and passing laws for the betterment of the American people.\u201d\n\nObama Lawmaking Resembles A Monarchy\n\nSome of the bluntest, even shocking, statements came from Michael Cannon, director of health policy studies at the libertarian think tank Cato Institute. Cannon knocked the president on several actions he has taken on Obamacare, which he said included issuing \u201cblanket waivers\u201d not authorized by the law and rewriting the law to spend taxpayers\u2019 dollars in ways the law forbids him to.\n\nThe health policy expert said that because the president has been so unfaithful to the law, it\u2019s no longer correct to say Obamacare is the law of the land.\n\n\u201cThis method of lawmaking has more in common with monarchy than democracy or a constitutional republic,\u201d he said.\n\nGuaranteed To Continue Abuse\n\nCannon didn\u2019t stop there. He went on to say that Obama\u2019s failure, or the failure of any other president, to faithfully execute his or her constitutional duty shouldn\u2019t be taken lightly.\n\n\u201cIt is cause for even greater alarm, because it guarantees that presidents from both parties will replicate and even surpass the abuses of their predecessors as payback for past injustices. The result is that democracy and freedom will suffer no matter who occupies the Oval Office.\u201d\n\nGovernment Could Be Overthrown\n\nLater in the hearing, Rep. Steven King, R-Iowa, later asked what the future of America looks like if upcoming executives overreach their power. Turley suggested there could be an \u201cuber-presidency,\u201d which he said would endanger individual liberty.\n\nAnother Georgetown University law professor, Nicholas Rosenkranz, said the ultimate check on presidential lawlessness is elections. But said Congress shouldn\u2019t rule out impeachment \u201cif you find that the president is willfully and repeatedly violating the Constitution.\u201d\n\nCannon said, \u201cThere is one last thing to which the people can resort if the government does not respect the restraints the Constitution places on the government. Abraham Lincoln talked about our right to alter our government, or our revolutionary right to overthrow it. That is certainly something that no one wants to contemplate but ... if the people come to believe that the government is no longer constrained by the laws then they will conclude that neither are they. That is why it is a very, very dangerous sort of thing for the president to do -- to wantonly ignore the laws and to try to impose obligations on people that the legislature did not approve.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://s2.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "house judicary committee, house judicary, congressional hearing, obama impeachment, obama obamacare, immigration reform, affordabel care act, republican immigration reform", "og": {"site_name": "International Business Times", "description": "The House Judiciary committee spent one day hearing claims that Obama may be acting outside the law and may be overthrown.", "title": "4 Outrageous GOP Claims Of What Could Happen If Obama Continues Ignoring Laws", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/4-outrageous-gop-claims-what-could-happen-if-obama-continues-ignoring-laws-1493858", "image": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2013/09/09/obama-care-speech.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The House Judiciary committee spent one day hearing claims that Obama may be acting outside the law and may be overthrown.", "title": "4 Outrageous GOP Claims Of What Could Happen If Obama Continues Ignoring Laws", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/4-outrageous-gop-claims-what-could-happen-if-obama-continues-ignoring-laws-1493858", "image": {"src": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2013/09/09/obama-care-speech.jpg", "identifier": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2013/09/09/obama-care-speech.jpg"}, "site": "@IBTimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "fb": {"app_id": 263851690471857, "pages": 128026713884051}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/IBTimes", "section": "World", "published_time": "2013-12-03T17:02:57-05:00", "modified_time": "2013-12-05T12:27:13-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The House Judiciary committee spent one day hearing claims that Obama may be acting outside the law and may be overthrown."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0eb9\"", "article_summary": "Instead, legal experts brought to the hearing by the committee of the Republican-controlled House provided some worst-case scenarios of what could happen if Obama, or any president for that matter, should continue ignoring laws passed by Congress.\nThe president has used his executive authority to implement \u201cdeferred action\u201d to suspend the deportation of immigrants brought to the country illegally as children.\nJonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University, told members of the committee that if one president unilaterally enforces laws, he will set a precedent for others to follow suit.\nShe cited immigration reform, the budget, and sequester cuts among the issues Congress has failed to deal with.\n\u201cThis method of lawmaking has more in common with monarchy than democracy or a constitutional republic,\u201d he said."}
