Johnson scored for Air Force, which has now won six straight over the Rams at home.\n\nBackup quarterback Nate Romine stepped in for starter Kale Pearson, who was a late scratch with a tender right ankle. Romine ran for a score and threw for 135 yards, including a 26-yard strike to Garrett Brown to get the Falcons in field-goal range.\n\nThis after Colorado State went for it on fourth-and-2 at the Air Force 42, only to have Dee Hart stopped short when he ran right into Steelhammer and Troy Timmerman. It gave Air Force good field position with 38 seconds left.\n\nA few plays later, they were well within the range of Conant, the most accurate kicker in school history. After a timeout by the Rams - Conant used the break to grab a quick drink of water - he drilled the kick and was mobbed by teammates.\n\n\"I got out there, looked up and (the flags on the goal posts) were straight down,\" Conant explained. \"I was like, `Yes! Let's go!\"'\n\nThe loss by the Rams ended any chance of them representing the Mountain Division in the league's title game.\n\nIt also opened the door to some armchair quarterbacking: Why would the Rams risk going for it on fourth and short?\n\n\"If you can't get a yard, you probably don't deserve to win the game anyway,\" Colorado State coach Jim McElwain said. \"We chose to go for it. They did a great job at the point of attack. And we didn't stop them on defense coming back.\n\n\"You know me by now. I'm not here to get a participation ribbon. We are going to go and try to win the ball game.\"\n\nThis has been quite a season at home for the Falcons, who finished 6-0 in friendly confines. They beat Boise State in September and now Colorado State, which was off to its best start since 1994.\n\nIt's also been quite the turnaround, too. Air Force has gone from two wins a season ago to nine this year, the biggest bounce-back in team history, surpassing the `58 squad that went 9-0-2 after going 3-6-1 the year before.\n\nGarrett Grayson, a Heisman Trophy candidate, completed 23 of 46 for 366 yards and three scores. He also threw his first interception since Oct. 4.\n\n\"They came out in the first half and punched us in the mouth, and we didn't answer back,\" Grayson said. \"We weren't used to it. If someone punched us, we punched them back. We waited until the second half. Sometimes, it's too late when you play a good team.\"\n\nHis top target, Rashard Higgins, finished with 12 catches for 193 yards. Xavier Williams also added a 76-yard score.\n\n\"It's disappointing and yet we've done some good things, too,\" McElwain said. \"We've got a bowl game coming up and we'll have an opportunity to get some more practice in and play another game.\"\n\nAir Force was thin at tailback with leading rusher Jacobi Owens out for the season due to a foot injury and senior Jon Lee unavailable to play after the Academy announced just before kickoff he was no longer a cadet in good standing. The team wouldn't elaborate on a reason, citing the privacy act.\n\nDavern and Johnson picked up the slack, combining for 118 tough yards up the middle.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Weston Steelhammer certainly proved he has a fitting football name and did so in the clutch against his team's biggest rival.", "language": "english", "author": "AP Sports", "og": {"description": "Weston Steelhammer certainly proved he has a fitting football name and did so in the clutch against his team's biggest rival.", "title": "Air Force Takes Down No. 21 Colorado State on Late Field Goal, 27-24", "url": "http://www.kktv.com/sports/headlines/Air-Force-Takes-Down-No-21-Colorado-State-on-Late-Field-Goal-27-24-284201261.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/E90/3F5/E903F5D4A9EE41D985A64F660397961E", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/699/DC7/699DC7E1CAAA43ED99B51E1ABAAAFFD0.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kktv.com", "description": "Weston Steelhammer certainly proved he has a fitting football name and did so in the clutch against his team's biggest rival.", "creator": "@kktv11news", "url": "http://www.kktv.com/sports/headlines/Air-Force-Takes-Down-No-21-Colorado-State-on-Late-Field-Goal-27-24-284201261.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/affootball+3.jpg", "title": "Air Force Takes Down No. 21 Colorado State on Late Field Goal, 27-24", "site": "@kktv11news", "card": "summary"}, "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Air Force Takes Down No. 21 Colorado State on Late Field Goal, 27-24", "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "gUw-UdhXT7u-BunNWfQWA_t3azu7BEGubOcNT6HddJQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Air Force Takes Down No, 21 Colorado State on Late"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdea3f\"", "article_summary": "They beat Boise State in September and now Colorado State, which was off to its best start since 1994.\nIt gave Air Force good field position with 38 seconds left.\n\"If you can't get a yard, you probably don't deserve to win the game anyway,\" Colorado State coach Jim McElwain said.\nThis after Colorado State went for it on fourth-and-2 at the Air Force 42, only to have Dee Hart stopped short when he ran right into Steelhammer and Troy Timmerman.\n\"It takes two to tango at a high level and this is one of those games where the teams played well,\" Air Force coach Troy Calhoun said."}
