In the 54th episode of the Grover Norquist show, ATR president Grover Norquist discusses the economic recovery since the crash of 2008 and where we currently stand in comparison to other recoveries in U.S. economic history.p>

As Norquist states in the podcast, “the Obama recovery [is] the weakest recovery since 1960” and “it’s way below the average, it’s significantly below the Reagan recovery”. President Obama’s policies of Obamacare and stimulus packages has left the United States in higher mountains of debt and slow economic growth. If the United States’ economy grew like it did during the Reagan recovery then the US GDP would be $4trillion greater and with 13 million more jobs.

A new President with a Republican controlled House and Senate can put the United States back on the track to greater growth and an overall better economy.
