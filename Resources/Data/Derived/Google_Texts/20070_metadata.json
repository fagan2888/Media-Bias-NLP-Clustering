Meditation, in a way, is like exercise for our brains: it\u2019s been shown to assist in mental health maintenance, improve our memory, empathy, and sense of self \u2014 similar to how exercise boosts our resilience, muscle strength, cardiovascular health, and blood pressure/cholesterol.\n\nPerhaps one of the most fascinating studies published on meditation is one from several years ago \u2014 but one that is good to keep in mind if you\u2019re interested in mental health and brain plasticity. The study, led by Harvard researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), found that meditating for only 8 weeks actually significantly changed the brain\u2019s grey matter \u2014 a major part of the central nervous system that is associated with processing information, as well as providing nutrients and energy to neurons. This is why, the authors believe, that meditation has shown evidence in improving memory, empathy, sense of self, and stress relief.\n\n\u201cAlthough the practice of meditation is associated with a sense of peacefulness and physical relaxation, practitioners have long claimed that meditation also provides cognitive and psychological benefits that persist throughout the day,\u201d Dr. Sara Lazar, a Harvard Medical School instructor in psychology, said in the news release. \u201cThis study demonstrates that changes in brain structure may underlie some of these reported improvements and that people are not just feeling better because they are spending time relaxing.\u201d\n\nIn the study, 16 participants took a Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction program for 8 weeks. Before and after the program, the researchers took MRIs of their brains. After spending an average of about 27 minutes per day practicing mindfulness exercise, the participants showed an increased amount of grey matter in the hippocampus, which helps with self-awareness, compassion, and introspection. In addition, participants with lower stress levels showed decreased grey matter density in the amygdala, which helps manage anxiety and stress.\n\n\u201cIt is fascinating to see the brain\u2019s plasticity and that, by practicing meditation, we can play an active role in changing the brain and can increase our well-being and quality of life,\u201d Dr. Britta Holzel, an author of the study, said in the press release.\n\nAnother recent study examining the health benefits of positive thinking found that mindfulness exercises like meditation or yoga actually changed the length of telomeres in breast cancer patients \u2014 which works to prevent chromosomes from declining. And in the past, researchers have found that people who practiced meditation actually had different brain structures than people who didn\u2019t.\n\nIndeed, the notion that meditation can foster improved sense of self, compassion, happiness, and focus is thousands of years old, but it\u2019s only now that science has begun backing it.
