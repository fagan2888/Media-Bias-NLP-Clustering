(David R. Jennings / Daily Camera)\n\nBoulder-area marijuana businesses have seen their entry into the recreational market delayed because Boulder and Louisville, the only other municipalities currently allowing conversions, didn't accept applications during the first round of state licensing in the fall.\n\nBoulder started accepting applications for conversion Jan. 2 and will take applications for co-location \u2014 with medical and recreational businesses operating on the same premises \u2014 beginning Tuesday.\n\nLouisville's two existing dispensaries can apply for recreational licenses starting Tuesday.\n\nHowever, the state won't accept retail marijuana license applications from businesses in municipalities that aren't accepting applications, and the state by law cannot issue licenses in less than 45 days.\n\nLouisville licensing officials said dispensaries there likely won't be on the agenda until the Feb. 24 meeting of the licensing authority, which is the same as the liquor board.\n\nBoulder issued its first conversion license Friday to Breckenridge Organic Therapy, which has its grow operation in Boulder and its store in the mountain town. The business expects to get its state license in late February.\n\nBoulder-based attorney Jeff Gard, who represents many marijuana businesses, said the process went very smoothly, and he hopes it indicates relations between the city and the industry will be productive.\n\nBoulder Tax and Licensing Manager Mishawn Cook said she has conversion interviews scheduled this week with Boulder Rx, Terrapin Care Station and Options Medical Center.\n\nState licenses pending\n\nJulie Postlethwait, a spokeswoman for Colorado's Marijuana Enforcement Division, said the state currently has four pending applications for retail stores in Boulder County. Her records did not distinguish between the city of Boulder and unincorporated areas.\n\nThe state also has seven pending cultivation licenses and three pending infused-product manufacturing licenses.\n\nOne of the cultivation licenses and one of the infused-product licenses could be issued as early as Jan. 27, but the state does not expect to issue any retail licenses in Boulder County this month, based on the application dates.\n\nContact Camera Staff Writer Erica Meltzer at 303-473-1355, meltzere@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/meltzere.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/marijuana/ci_24939174/canarys-song-nederland-poised-be-boulder-countys-first", "sailthru.author": "By Erica Meltzer ,  Camera Staff Writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:24939174:view"}, "startDate": "2014-01-18T12:00:00-0700", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "If the Nederland Board of Trustees approves the dispensary's license application at its Tuesday night meeting, the store could begin selling pot to retail customers 21 and over as early as Wednesday, though a manager said the shop's owners are shooting for Feb. 1.", "title": "Canary's Song in Nederland poised to be Boulder County's first retail marijuana shop", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/marijuana/ci_24939174/canarys-song-nederland-poised-be-boulder-countys-first", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2014/0117/20140117__19dcapotw_TEST~2.jpg", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Marijuana", "modificationDate": "2014-01-19T00:54:10-0700", "endDate": "2024-01-17T22:24:07-0700", "news_keywords": "Boulder, Colorado, recreational marijuana, medical marijuana, news, entertainment, food, business, crime, politics, events, real estate,Boulder County", "byline": "By Erica Meltzer,", "pubDate": "2014-01-17T22:38:50-0700", "sailthru.date": "2014-01-18T12:00:00-0700", "sailthru.title": "Canary's Song in Nederland poised to be Boulder County's first retail marijuana shop", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2014/0117/20140117__19dcapotw_TEST~1_300.jpg", "description": "If the Nederland Board of Trustees approves the dispensary's license application at its Tuesday night meeting, the store could begin selling pot to retail customers 21 and over as early as Wednesday, though a manager said the shop's owners are shooting for Feb. 1.", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/marijuana/ci_24939174/canarys-song-nederland-poised-be-boulder-countys-first", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "If the Nederland Board of Trustees approves the dispensary's license application at its Tuesday night meeting, the store could begin selling pot to retail customers 21 and over as early as Wednesday, though a manager said the shop's owners are shooting for Feb. 1.", "title": "Canary's Song in Nederland poised to be Boulder County's first retail marijuana shop"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2014/0117/20140117__19dcapotw_TEST~1.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdef7e\"", "article_summary": "The Canary's Song is the only medical marijuana business in Boulder County to already have received its state license to sell recreational marijuana.\nIf OK'd by town Tuesday, recreational sales could begin WednesdayThe Canary's Song in Nederland appears on track to become the first recreational marijuana store in Boulder County.\nOwner Dylan Donaldson said he could have his county license by the end of January and his state license in mid-February.\nSlow arrival of retail potMedical marijuana samples are shown at The Canary's Song dispensary in Nederland last week.\nBoulder County has not received any other retail license requests, she said."}
