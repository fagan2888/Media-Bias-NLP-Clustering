Can you believe it? Some Boulder people even bragged about it.\n\n\u201cI own that dog!\u201d they would say. \u201cHe is mine. I own him.\u201d\n\nThat kind of insensitive thinking ended, fortunately, when the city council spent hours and hours in debate and passed an ordinance in which people with pets officially became \u201cguardians\u201d of the animals.\n\nThat term more accurately reflects the tough job of raising a dog or cat \u2014 finding the right school, encouraging them to play a musical instrument, guiding them into a full and useful life and, of course, overlooking that peculiar way dogs have of saying hello to their friends.\n\nAnd Boulder no longer allows people \u2014 and if this isn\u2019t a meddling government, then I don\u2019t know what is \u2014 to ride a bicycle while naked or run naked in an actual race with only a pumpkin on their head as they did for years.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the downright abysmal treatment intolerant Boulder has given to the gay, lesbian and transgender community.\n\nOh sure, this year the village hosts its 4th annual Transgender Awareness Week (Nov. 13-21) with lots of community events, including a seminar entitled \u201cTransgender Inclusion in Policy and Practice: Examining Sports.\u201d\n\nThe celebration will also feature a host of speakers, including one on the topic, \u201cObamacare, Discrimination and Transgender Coloradans.\u201d (As we all know, when gay, lesbian or transgender people tried to navigate the Obamacare website, they had trouble creating accounts, were unable to log in to the site and received confusing and indecipherable error messages.)\n\nBoulder\u2019s Transgender Awareness Week also will have a \u201cTrans and Genderqueer support group,\u201d a Gender Identity Center candlelight vigil for Transgender Day of Remembrance and many other events.\n\nBut none of that matters, obviously, in light of the almost incredible lack of tolerance and good taste shown by organizers of the famous Bolder Boulder 10K race with their race slogan, \u201cSea Level is for Sissies.\u201d\n\nFrom the Daily Camera: \u201cOut Boulder, an LGBTQ group, has launched an online petition seeking to pressure organizers of the Bolder Boulder to drop their slogan \u2026 because they say the word \u2018sissies\u2019 is derogatory.\u201d\n\nThe petition says, \u201cThe word is used to (demean) traits problematic and stereotypically associated with women \u2026 traits all genders have but are not valued because they are associated with women. All genders express emotions and they should be embraced when they do.\u201d\n\nRace director Cliff Bosley says the slogan, in place for some six years, will remain. He explained that it and other race slogans, such as \u201cAltitude Adjustment\u201d and \u201cRun With Altitude,\u201d refer to the elevation of Boulder and are not meant to offend anyone.\n\nRight.\n\nAnd I suppose a guy like me, who leaves his putts ridiculously short on the golf course, is just supposed to overlook the jeering, laughing and golf-buddy questioning such as, \u201cSo, did your parents have any sons?\u201d\n\nContact Rich Tosches at richtosches@gmail.com.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Tosches: Politically incorrect and insensitive Boulder", "title": "Tosches: Politically incorrect and insensitive Boulder", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/05/16/tosches-politically-incorrect-and-insensitive-boulder/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140516__20140518_Z00_OP18C_TOSCHESp1.jpg", "height": 386}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140516__20140518_Z00_OP18C_TOSCHESp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-05-16T13:24:44+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T18:31:56+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda905\"", "article_summary": "And then there\u2019s the downright abysmal treatment intolerant Boulder has given to the gay, lesbian and transgender community.\nFor example, until 2000 it was perfectly OK in Boulder for people in the company of a dog or cat to say they \u201cowned\u201d the animal.\nI\u2019m sick and tired of the village of Boulder and its intolerance and political incorrectness, its refusal to recognize and honor diversity and its lack of compassion for human beings and animals.\nHe explained that it and other race slogans, such as \u201cAltitude Adjustment\u201d and \u201cRun With Altitude,\u201d refer to the elevation of Boulder and are not meant to offend anyone.\nBoulder\u2019s Transgender Awareness Week also will have a \u201cTrans and Genderqueer support group,\u201d a Gender Identity Center candlelight vigil for Transgender Day of Remembrance and many other events."}
