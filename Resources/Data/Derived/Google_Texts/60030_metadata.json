Scott Walker (R) debated challenger Mary Burke (D) on Friday, and the issue of the minimum wage offered the candidates a chance to highlight their differences. The question posed summarized the situation nicely: can a full-time worker live on $7.25 an hour? And does the state have a responsibility to even set a minimum wage?\n\nBurke \u201cstrongly\u201d endorsed a higher legal minimum, but the Republican incumbent largely dodged the question, though he seemed to express opposition to the law itself. \u201cI want jobs that pay two or three times the minimum wage,\u201d Walker said , adding, \u201cThe way that you do that is not by an arbitrary level of a state.\u201d\n\nDaniel Bice at the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel followed up on that point in an interview with the governor today, asking Walker whether he believes the law should exist. The governor replied\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m not going to repeal it but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s, I don\u2019t think it serves a purpose. Because we\u2019re debating then about what the lowest levels are at. I want people to make, like I said the other night, two or three times that.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a striking thing for a governor to say during a tough re-election campaign, especially given his economic record \u2013 Walker promised Wisconsin voters four years ago that he\u2019d create 250,000 jobs in his first term, and he\u2019s struggling to get to Election Day with roughly half that total.\n\nIndeed, if the governor doesn\u2019t think the minimum wage \u201cserves a purpose,\u201d it\u2019s not too late for Walker to ask someone to explain the law\u2019s rationale.\n\nEstablishing a minimum wage is not about creating a target income for an entire population \u2013 it\u2019s about creating a floor so that full-time workers don\u2019t have to live in poverty.\n\nWalker\u2019s comments are rather bewildering. When Democrats created the federal minimum wage \u2013 after Henry Ford helped prove its value \u2013 the point wasn\u2019t to \u201cdebate what the lowest levels\u201d would be for most people, but rather, the law was created as a protection against abuse. Its existence did not prevent U.S. workers from creating the world\u2019s most dynamic middle class.\n\nHow an incumbent governor of a Midwestern state can still find this confusing is a bit of a mystery.\n\nFor that matter, we can look around the country and see plenty of states doing quite well after raising their minimum wage, which makes sense \u2013 when more workers have more money in their pockets, they\u2019ll spend more, which creates more economic activity and more jobs.\n\nIt\u2019s one of the reasons a higher minimum wage is so popular with so much of the country.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "As if Wisconsin Gov.
