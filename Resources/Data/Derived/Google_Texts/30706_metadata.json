Exactly two days after the announcement of the Berghal/Taliban-Five deal, Cuba\u2019s Terror-Sponsoring (official classification by U.S. State Dept.) regime started clamoring for an Alan Gross/Cuban-Five deal.\n\nAlan Gross is a Jewish American held hostage by the Castro regime since December 2009 when he was arrested while distributing computers and satellite phones to Cuba\u2019s microscopic ( and mostly regime-collaborationist) Jewish community while on assignment for USAID (United States Agency for International Development.) After a \u201ctrial,\u201d the Castro regime formally sentenced Gross to fifteen years in prison.\n\n\u201cThe Cuban Five\u201d are Cuban terrorist/ spies nabbed in south Florida in 1998 and convicted in U.S. federal courts of 26 counts of espionage along with conspiracy to commit murder-- of three U.S. citizens. Two of the five communist spies have already had their sentences reduced and been returned to heroes\u2019 welcomes in Cuba.\n\nTo add grotesque insult to Alan Gross\u2019 injury, the very people he was attempting to help, \u201ctestified\u201d against him in Castro\u2019s kangaroo court almost en masse. You have to be very careful when entering a snake pit like Castro\u2019s Cuba.\n\nAlan Gross\u2019 heart seemed in the right place, but the wisdom of his Cuban mission can be debated. The people he was trying to help\u2014the few Jews who remained in Castro\u2019s Cuba after over 90 per cent fled the communist revolution\u2014were mostly old Bolsheviks who couldn\u2019t bring themselves to break with the old time religion. As mentioned, they and their descendants did their duty to the Castro regime by ratting out Alan Gross during judicial procedures perfectly mimicking those presided over by Andrei Vishinsky during The Great Terror\u2019s show trials.\n\n\u201cEt Tu Adela?\u201d might have been gasped by the hapless Alan Gross during his trial. But we don\u2019t know because his \u201ctrial\u201d was closed to the (uncomplaining) press \u2013from CNN to ABC from NBC to CBS from NPR to PBS-- who infest Cuba. After all, these \u201cgallant crusades for the truth!\u201d (as Columbia school of Journalism hails it\u2019s graduates) have plenty on their Cuban plates already, what with the vital tasks of transcribing the Stalinist regime\u2019s steady flow of propaganda hand-outs and reporting such bombshell scoops as what Beyonce and Jay-Z wore on their Havana visit.\n\n\u201cAdela\u201d refers to Castroite apparatchik Adela Dworin, who performs as president of Havana\u2019s \u201cJewish Community House\u201d for gullible tourists and \u201ccultural exchange\u201d ambassadors to the Castro family fiefdom. Later, as a proper cap for the revolting Stalinesque charade, Adela Dworin visited Gross in his cell and posed smilingly with her arm around the gaunt but bitterly smiling American hostage she swindled, framed and helped condemn to fifteen years in a KGB-designed dungeon.\n\nA declassified KGB document from May, 20, 1981 revealed by Vladimir Bukovsky snickers the following: \u201cCultural exchanges with foreign countries are our most effective propaganda.\u201d\n\nTo say nothing of a handy-dandy cash pipeline and hostage buffet. As mentioned, Alan Gross was on assignment for USAID. But the scamming of U.S. agencies has never offered even modest sport for Castro\u2019s people. The only challenge might be....remember how on the old Carol Burnett show how Carol, Harvey Korman and Tim Conway always cracked up during skits? After trying to stifle the guffaws?\n\nWell, who could possibly blame Castro and his people for similar facial contortions when sneaking vital data to our crackerjack CIA sleuths. To wit:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve infiltrated Castro\u2019s guerrilla group in the Sierra Mountains. The Castro brothers and Ernesto \u2018Che\u2019 Guevara have no affiliations with any Communists whatsoever.\u201d (Havana CIA station chief Jim Noel Nov. 1958.)\n\n\u201cFidel Castro is not only not a communist \u2013he\u2019s a strong anti-Communist fighter. He\u2019s ready to help us in the hemisphere\u2019s anti-communist fight and we should share our intelligence with him.\u201d (CIA Cuba \u201cexpert\u201d Frank Bender, after conferring with Fidel Castro upon the latter\u2019s visit to the U.S. in April, 1959.)\n\nIn an unguarded moment while speaking to the Simon Weisenthal\u2019s Rabbi Abraham Cooper who was allowed to visit Gross last year, a Castro official spilled the beans on Gross\u2019 arrest. Naturally, the U.S. media (eager to maintain their cushy Havana bureaus) have \u201coverlooked\u201d this fascinating item. \u201cEveryone knows that the Jews have a lot of clout in Washington,\u201d the Castro official told Rabbi Cooper, \u201csomewhat sheepishly\u201d-- so sentencing Gross to 15 years could be the key to win the freedom of their agents jailed in the U.S., the thinking went.\u201d\n\nPoint is, Castro got his American hostage in December 2009, and -- convinced he held a good hand -- immediately cranked up the propaganda campaign to swap his convicted terrorists for Alan Gross. This \u201cFree the Cuban Five\u201d campaign features a rogue\u2019s gallery of Castro\u2019s American agents\u2013of-influence, on the payroll and off; from Danny Glover to Martin Sheen and Susan Sarandon, from Oliver Stone to and Tom Hayden and Jimmy Carter.\n\nYes, the \u201cElder Statesmen\u201d of America\u2019s majority political party lends his name to a communist propaganda campaign to unconditionally free the KGB-trained terrorist guilty of-- from the FBI affidavit:\n\n*Gathering intelligence against the Boca Chica Air Naval Station in Key West, the McDill Air Force Base in Tampa and the headquarters of the U.S. Southern Command in Homestead, Fla.\n\n* Compiling the names, home addresses and medical files of the U.S. Southern Command\u2019s top officers, along with those of hundreds of officers stationed at Boca Chica.\n\n* Infiltrating the headquarters of the U.S. Southern Command.\n\n* Sending letter bombs to Cuban-Americans.\n\n* Spying on McDill Air Force Base, the U.S. armed forces\u2019 worldwide headquarters for fighting \u201clow-intensity\u201d conflicts.\n\n* Locating entry points into Florida for smuggling explosive material.\n\nOne of these Castro agents, Gerardo Hernandez, also infiltrated the Cuban-exile group Brothers to the Rescue, who flew unarmed planes to rescue Cuban rafters in the Florida straits, also known as \u201cthe cemetery without crosses.\u201d The estimates of the number of Cubans dying horribly in the \u201ccemetery without crosses\u201d run from 50-85,000. Brothers to The Rescue risked their lives almost daily, flying over the straits, alerting and guiding the Coast Guard to any balseros, and saving thousands of these desperate people from joining that terrible tally. (Prior to Castroism, by the way, Cuba was swamped with more immigrants per-capita than the U.S., including during the Ellis Island years.)\n\nBy February of 1996, Brothers to The Rescue had flown 1,800 of these humanitarian missions and helped rescue 4,200 men, women and children. That month Danny Glover\u2019s and Jimmy Carter\u2019s cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre\u2019 passed to Castro the flight plan for one of the Brothers\u2019 humanitarian flights over the straits.\n\nWith this info in hand, Castro\u2019s Top Guns, jumped into their MIGs, took off and valiantly blasted apart (in international air space) the lumbering and utterly defenseless Cessnas. Four members of the humanitarian flights were thus murdered in cold blood by communists. Three of these murdered men were U.S. citizens, one a decorated Vietnam veteran.\n\nFreedom Center pamphlets now available on Kindle: Click here.\n\nSubscribe to Frontpage's TV show, The Glazov Gang, and LIKE it on Facebook.", "article_metadata": {"rating": "general", "description": "The Alan Gross/Cuban-Five deal?", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Frontpage Mag", "description": "The Alan Gross/Cuban-Five deal?", "title": "The Taliban Got Back Their Terrorists \u2013 Now Castro Wants His", "url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/fpm/233502/taliban-got-back-their-terrorists-%E2%80%93-now-castro-humberto-fontova", "updated_time": "2015-06-22T23:45:18-04:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/fpm/233502/taliban-got-back-their-terrorists-%E2%80%93-now-castro-humberto-fontova", "description": "The Alan Gross/Cuban-Five deal?", "card": "summary", "title": "The Taliban Got Back Their Terrorists \u2013 Now Castro Wants His"}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-10T20:25:15-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-22T23:45:18-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda1dd\"", "article_summary": "The Castro brothers and Ernesto \u2018Che\u2019 Guevara have no affiliations with any Communists whatsoever.\u201d (Havana CIA station chief Jim Noel Nov.\nAfter a \u201ctrial,\u201d the Castro regime formally sentenced Gross to fifteen years in prison.\nYou have to be very careful when entering a snake pit like Castro\u2019s Cuba.\n\u201cEt Tu Adela?\u201d might have been gasped by the hapless Alan Gross during his trial.\nAlan Gross\u2019 heart seemed in the right place, but the wisdom of his Cuban mission can be debated."}
