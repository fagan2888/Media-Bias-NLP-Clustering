The workers were both full time and part time and worked in both the private sector and government.\n\nAdditionally, only seven percent said they\u2019re aiming for senior or C-level management, according to a new report released Wednesday morning.\n\nRelated: What Women Can Learn from Men at Work\n\nThere are several reasons for this lack of career drive in the U.S. One is that a majority of respondents say they\u2019re satisfied with their current job. Another is that a third of people don\u2019t want to sacrifice their work life balance for anything more taxing. And 17 percent said they don\u2019t think they have the necessary education to move up in their careers.\n\nHowever, African-American and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) workers are more likely to aspire to a leadership role compared to the overall average, at 39 percent and 44 percent respectively.\n\nA lack of female executives and minority executives in corporate C-suites has long been a criticism of corporate America \u2013 and one in five workers surveyed by CareerBuilder, or 20 percent, still perceive the existence of a glass ceiling at their organization. Among those who actually aspire to leadership positions, that percentage is even higher.\n\nRelated: 5 Smart Steps to Combat Workplace Bullying\n\n\u201cWhile most workers don\u2019t want a top job, it is important for organizational leaders to promote a culture of meritocracy in which all workers, regardless of gender, race or sexual orientation, are able to reach senior-level roles based on their skills and past contributions alone,\u201d said Rosemary Haefner, vice president of human resources at CareerBuilder in a press release.\n\nCareerBuilder conducted the survey online in May and June with the help of the U.S. Harris Poll. The surveyed workers were all above age 18.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Two-thirds of American workers don\u2019t aspire to leadership or management positions, according to a CareerBuilder survey released Wednesday.", "title": "Why So Many American Workers Lack Ambition", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/09/10/Why-So-Many-American-Workers-Lack-Ambition", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/09092014_Man_Wall_Motivation_Ladder_Graffiti.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/09/10/Why-So-Many-American-Workers-Lack-Ambition", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/09092014_Man_Wall_Motivation_Ladder_Graffiti.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Two-thirds of American workers don\u2019t aspire to leadership or management positions, according to a CareerBuilder survey released Wednesday.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd427d\"", "article_summary": "Two-thirds of the more than 3,600 workers recently surveyed by CareerBuilder said they don\u2019t aspire to leadership or management positions.\nThe surveyed workers were all above age 18.\nMost American workers have no ambition, judging by a new study.\nAmong those who actually aspire to leadership positions, that percentage is even higher.\nThe workers were both full time and part time and worked in both the private sector and government."}
