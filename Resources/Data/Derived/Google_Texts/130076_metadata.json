She had just lost her job, was going through a divorce, and she and her two kids had to move back into her parents\u2019 house.\n\n\u201cI was so stressed out,\u201d says Price, who lives in San Diego. \u201cI remember going to bed that night thinking, \u2018Tomorrow when I wake up, I\u2019m going to be stressing all day about how I can\u2019t take care of everything I need to take care of.\u2019 \u201d\n\nInstead, she awoke at 2 a.m. with a pain in her hand and arm. She was having a heart attack.\n\nPrice recovered at the UC San Diego Medical Center. But the heart attack had weakened her heart enough to put her at risk for heart failure.\n\nThat\u2019s when she learned about an unusual study that might help her recovery. It wasn\u2019t about a new drug. Instead, researchers were looking at the experience of gratitude and how it might affect people at risk for heart failure. One of the things Price and the other participants were asked to do was to write journal entries about what they were grateful for each day.\n\nFor Price, it was hard. She says that on some days she felt like she had nothing to be grateful for. Still, the exercise got her thinking more about the things that made her happy, like walking on the beach and playing music at her church.\n\nUC San Diego School of Medicine clinical research coordinator Meredith Pung was a co-author of the gratitude study. She says keeping a gratitude journal is like strength training for the heart. Altogether, researchers looked at 186 people at risk for heart failure.\n\n\u201cSo they (had) some evidence of structural abnormalities that you can see on their heart if you use an echocardiogram,\u201d Pung says of participants. \u201cBut they don\u2019t yet have any signs or symptoms of heart failure.\u201d\n\nHeart failure happens when the heart isn\u2019t getting enough blood. People who have had heart attacks, like Price, are at higher risk of developing it. And half of those with heart failure die within five years of diagnosis.\n\nPung says the study participants who kept a gratitude journal for eight weeks showed signs of a healthier heart afterward. Subjects who didn\u2019t keep a journal did not show improvement. The results were published by the American Psychological Association in its journal, Spirituality in Clinical Practice.\n\n\u201cSo the heart just needs a break, right?\u201d says Pung. \u201cWith grateful contemplation and gratitude journaling, that allows a little break, a physiological break for the heart, and it allows it to continue its job for as long as we need it.\u201d\n\nI visited Pung\u2019s lab at UC San Diego to see how the study works.\n\nFirst, participants put on a device called a bio harness, a device connected to a computer that monitored a participant\u2019s heart rate. Then Pung asked them to write in a journal for five minutes detailing what they were grateful for.\n\nThen researchers looked at heart rate variability onscreen.\n\n\u201cWhile you\u2019re journaling, what it would end up looking like on the screen is the peaks,\u201d Pung explains. \u201cSome would be closer together, some would be further apart. Instead of boom, boom, boom, all equal distances apart. And that [variability] is what we want to see in a healthy individual.\u201d\n\nBlood analysis from the UCSD study suggests that more grateful patients were at lower risk of heart failure. These patients also reported fewer symptoms of depression, better sleep, and they felt empowered to take care of their health.\n\nNatalie Price says gratitude journaling got her out of her depression and back on her feet. Two years ago, she couldn\u2019t walk down the street without gasping for breath. Today, she walks to work almost every day.\n\n\u201cAnd I joined a gym,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was enjoyable. I started doing my physical activities, and I became more cognizant of my health, of what I ate. And I still am.\u201d\n\nPrice\u2019s life hasn\u2019t become easy. She\u2019s still in the middle of a nasty divorce, still trying to make ends meet. But now when she gets stressed out, she picks up a paper and pen and writes about the things she can be grateful for in her life.\n\nThis is story is a part of a one-hour documentary on the science of gratitude for Public Radio International.
