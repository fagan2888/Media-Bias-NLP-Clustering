For three decades, children who might otherwise have gotten no education sat through his classes.\n\n\u201cI really don\u2019t remember how many have passed through (the school). They must be in thousands,\u201d Ayub, who is to be honored Monday at a ceremony in the eastern city of Lahore, told The Associated Press at the field where classes are held. \u201cWhat I know is that I will continue this mission until my last breath.\u201d\n\nAyub, a 57-year-old government worker, came to Islamabad in 1976 from his hometown of Mandi Bahauddin, about 170 kilometers (105 miles) from the capital to find a job so he could take care of his seven siblings after his father died. Back home, he had struggled through a number of menial jobs. In Islamabad, he eventually found a low-level position in the city\u2019s emergency services. He worked hard to learn new skills such as first aid and firefighting \u2014 he even studied how to defuse bombs \u2014 and was eventually promoted to a full-fledged firefighter.\n\nNever forgetting his promise to his father, he always sent money home to his siblings.\n\nOne day in 1985, he saw a boy about 12 years old busing tables at a restaurant, and that sparked an idea that eventually changed his life, Ayub said.\n\n\u201cI thought, \u2018He is no different than my younger brother.\u2019 At that moment I decided to teach him, and that was the start of my open school mission,\u201d he said.\n\nAyub convinced other boys working in shops and food outlets in the neighborhood to study with him in the middle of the market for an hour or two. But the shopkeepers \u2014 upset that he was taking up too much space \u2014 pushed him out. After moving multiple times, he eventually settled in an open field near the city\u2019s Kohsar market. City officials have agreed not to bother him as long as he doesn\u2019t try to set up a permanent structure.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Pakistani teaches underprivileged kids in outdoor school", "title": "Pakistani teaches underprivileged kids in outdoor school", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Pakistani teaches underprivileged kids in outdoor school", "title": "Pakistani teaches underprivileged kids in outdoor school", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/22/pakistani_teaches_underprivileged_kids_in_outdoor_school/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/pakistan-street-teacher.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Pakistani teaches underprivileged kids in outdoor school", "title": "Pakistani teaches underprivileged kids in outdoor school", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/pakistan-street-teacher.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Zarar Khan", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd80cf\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI thought, \u2018He is no different than my younger brother.\u2019 At that moment I decided to teach him, and that was the start of my open school mission,\u201d he said.\nAfter moving multiple times, he eventually settled in an open field near the city\u2019s Kohsar market.\nCity officials have agreed not to bother him as long as he doesn\u2019t try to set up a permanent structure.\nNever forgetting his promise to his father, he always sent money home to his siblings.\nTopics: From the Wires, NewsISLAMABAD (AP) \u2014 On any given day in the Pakistani capital, a group of young people can be seen gathered outdoors in an open field, books open and looking at makeshift blackboards attached to metal pipes in an open-air school."}
