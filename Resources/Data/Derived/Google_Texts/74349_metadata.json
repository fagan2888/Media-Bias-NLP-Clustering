Officials with the insurer declined to comment Thursday.\n\nThe new policy does not necessarily extend to CareFirst plans offered by large employers, who decide their own coverage.\n\nIn ending discrimination against patients based on sexual orientation or gender identity, CareFirst joins the state of Maryland, which changed its policies for state employees last year and for Medicaid in January.\n\n\u201cThis is very significant for the transgender community in Maryland,\u201d said Patrick Paschall, a spokesman for FreeState Legal.\n\nThe actions are the latest examples of greater recognition of transgender rights after the state's passage of the Fairness for All Marylanders Act of 2013, which banned transgender discrimination in employment and other public accommodations. FreeState Legal had argued that while the fairness act did not specifically address health insurance, it signaled that the state would not tolerate gender identity discrimination in any form.\n\nThe decision to expand coverage under Medicaid was first announced during the end of Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley\u2019s term, but put under review when current Gov. Larry Hogan, who agreed to the expansion after consulting with the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.\n\nA non-discrimination clause in the Affordable Care Act required the state to provide transgender patients with coverage for reassignment surgery and other medical care, said Shannon M. McMahon, the state\u2019s deputy secretary of health care financing.\n\nThe expansion of the Medicaid and CareFirst coverage could have an impact on at least 5,000 people, FreeState said. The state estimates that at least 20 people could get gender reassignment surgery in the first year.\n\namcdaniels@baltsun.com", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Carefirst expands coverage to transgender patients", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Baltimore Sun", "author": "Baltimore Sun", "og": {"site_name": "baltimoresun.com", "description": "CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield, the state's largest insurer, is expanding coverage so gender reassignment surgery is covered for transgender customers in Maryland.", "title": "Carefirst expands coverage to transgender patients", "url": "http://www.baltimoresun.com/health/blog/bal-transgender-health-coverage-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-564e0eb7/turbine/bal-transgender-health-coverage", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp06.15", "twitter": {"site": "@baltimoresun", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "CareFirst, transgender, health coverage, Medicaid", "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=496681035, app-argument=http://www.baltimoresun.com/deeplinkid/85089379", "fb": {"page_id": 9299179711, "app_id": 310302989040998}, "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2015-11-19", "Description": "CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield, the state's largest insurer, is expanding coverage to transgender patients that will make gender transition surgeries more affordable for many residents.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "CareFirst, transgender, health coverage, Medicaid"}, "article_summary": "CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield, the state's largest insurer, is expanding coverage so gender reassignment surgery is covered for transgender customers in Maryland.\nThe expansion of the Medicaid and CareFirst coverage could have an impact on at least 5,000 people, FreeState said.\nThe new policy does not necessarily extend to CareFirst plans offered by large employers, who decide their own coverage.\nThe actions are the latest examples of greater recognition of transgender rights after the state's passage of the Fairness for All Marylanders Act of 2013, which banned transgender discrimination in employment and other public accommodations.\nIn ending discrimination against patients based on sexual orientation or gender identity, CareFirst joins the state of Maryland, which changed its policies for state employees last year and for Medicaid in January."}
