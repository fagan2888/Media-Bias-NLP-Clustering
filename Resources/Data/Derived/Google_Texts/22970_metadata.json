Honoring Greece's debts, the onetime House Budget Committee chairman told us, \"is an issue of personal responsibility.\"Kasich spoke to us as Tsipras was completing his second meeting this year with Putin.Amid mounting rumors that they discussed a loan from Russia in return for Greece supporting Russia's seizure of Crimea within the European Union, Kasich said such an agreement would \"be a terrible decision on the part of the Greeks\" and \"a very, very ugly scenario.\"As to how to improve U.S. relations with Israel, Kasich stated: \"Just realize the deep friendship we have with Israel. It needs to be attended to and we need to make sure that we don't put them in a position of risk.\"Regarding President Barack Obama's refusal to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during his last visit to Washington, Kasich said: \"I would have figured out how to have coffee with him at a Starbucks without a camera around.\"Kasich also emphasized that the U.S. must continue to develop its energy resources as insurance against \"Putin using energy as a weapon.\" Having long criticized Obama for his proposed nuclear agreement with Iran, the Ohioan instead called for \"continued sanctions\" against the theocratic regime in Tehran.Turning to the domestic front, Kasich offered a spirited defense of his joining the federal Medicaid exchange under Obamacare. He called his acceptance an example of \"how I brought Ohio dollars back to Ohio,\" and he has been able to apply the funds to mental health programs \u2014 critical, Kasich said, \"at a time when we have more [mentally ill] people in jail than in psychiatric hospitals.\"If the Supreme Court strikes down major parts of Obamacare in its King v. Burwell ruling, Kasich told us that \"our people have looked at various alternatives but nothing has been decided at this point. We'll see what they [the Supreme Court justices] do.\"Asked by Newsmax when he plans to officially announce his candidacy, Kasich replied: \"We have decided to announce here today to you [and then he paused and smiled] that we still have not determined what we will do.\"We are very disciplined in the way we do things. I will do it, in all likelihood, if we have a good plan together and I can win. If you can't win, then you don't do it.\"\n\nJohn Gizzi is chief political columnist and White House correspondent for Newsmax.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "john kasich, foreign policy, russia, greece, israel, john gizzi", "pubdate": "2015-06-22T10:31:43", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "A decision by Greece to accept a bailout loan from Russia would be \"a very, very, ugly scenario,\" Ohio governor and probable Republican presidential candidate John Kasich told Newsmax in an exclusive interview in which he further spelled out his foreign policy priorities.", "title": "Kasich: Russian Bailout of Greece Would Be 'Very Ugly Scenario'", "url": "http://www.newsmax.com/John-Gizzi/john-kasich-foreign-policy-russia-greece/2015/06/22/id/651623/", "type": "article", "image": "http://www.newsmax.com/CMSPages/GetFile.aspx?guid=6b536822-6b92-4ba2-9f84-6d4772fe36a6&SiteName=Newsmax", "page_id": 85452072376}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.newsmax.com/John-Gizzi/john-kasich-foreign-policy-russia-greece/2015/06/22/id/651623/", "title": "Kasich: Russian Bailout of Greece Would Be 'Very Ugly Scenario'", "description": "A decision by Greece to accept a bailout loan from Russia would be \"a very, very, ugly scenario,\" Ohio governor and probable Republican presidential candidate John Kasich told Newsmax in an exclusive interview in which he further spelled out his foreign policy priorities.", "site": "Newsmax"}, "fb": {"admins": 100002083767056, "app_id": 323020797885219}, "msvalidate.01": "FAF1322EC761685A5DD9344A1C19E82A", "epoch": 1434969103, "google-site-verification": "Jt2HUKgzJJw9VwIQJv31ETytuvNNm5ypTWN6j0nYvHM", "keywords": "john kasich, foreign policy, russia, greece, israel, john gizzi", "article": {"section": "John-Gizzi", "published_time": "2015-06-22T10:31:43"}, "original-source": "http://www.newsmax.com/John-Gizzi/john-kasich-foreign-policy-russia-greece/2015/06/22/id/651623/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "description": "A decision by Greece to accept a bailout loan from Russia would be  a very, very, ugly scenario,  Ohio governor and probable Republican presidential candidate John Kasich told Newsmax in an exclusive interview in which he further spelled out his foreign policy priorities."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcad41\"", "article_summary": "\"As to how to improve U.S. relations with Israel, Kasich stated: \"Just realize the deep friendship we have with Israel.\n\"If the Supreme Court strikes down major parts of Obamacare in its King v.
