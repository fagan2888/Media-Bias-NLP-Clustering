The government will provide an initial $19.8 million with as much as $90 million of total funding, according to Robin Robinson, director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority. The news comes just one day after the National Institutes of Health unveiled a similar partnership with the industry over the next half-decade, one in which investigators hope to develop improvement treatments for diabetes, Alzheimer\u2019s, and lupus.\n\n\u201cAntibiotic resistance adversely impacts our nation\u2019s ability to respond effectively to a bioterrorist attack and to everyday public health threats,\u201d Robinson said in a statement. \u201cBy partnering with industry to develop novel antimicrobial drugs against biothreats that also treat drug-resistant bacteria, we can address health security and public health needs efficiently.\u201d\n\nCarbavance might also protect America from a couple of bioagents, melioidosis, and glanders. With today\u2019s antibiotic drugs, 40 percent of those exposed to those agents would become sick with mostly fatal disease. The research effort would seek population protection against melioidosis, also known as Whitmore\u2019s disease, and often mistaken for tuberculosis or pneumonia, as well as the respiratory disease glanders, caused by a bacteria affecting skin, blood, lungs, or muscles. Both bacteria have become resistant to contemporary antibiotic treatment, scientists say.\n\nMoreover, Carbavance might potentially be used to treat complicated urinary tract infections, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, as well as both hospital- and ventilator-acquired pneumonia \u2014 ailments known to be resistant to antibiotics. The new partnership is the latest from the government in supporting the development of broad-spectrum antimicrobials and other technologies required for biodefense in the 21st century.\n\nLast month, the Food and Drug Administration designated the drug candidate as a \u201cQualified Infectious Disease Product,\u201d promising Rempex Pharmaceuticals \u201cfast-track\u201d consideration for regulatory approval as well as five years of product exclusivity.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "bioterrorism, antibiotic, resistant, bacteria, be, aided, carbavance, drug, candidate, hhs", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The rise of drug-resistant bacteria threatens to undo a century of medical progress that is dependent on antibiotics for the most routine medical operations.
