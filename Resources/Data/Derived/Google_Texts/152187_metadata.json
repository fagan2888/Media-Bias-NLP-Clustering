The FOIA requests\u2026 seek documents related to the agencies\u2019 development of tax credit calculators on Healthcare.gov.\u201d\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nIt is important to note that for an exchange website such as Healthcare.gov to offer tax credits, it must have a tax credit calculator that allows individuals to view the actual cost of their coverage after tax credits have been applied to their premiums.\n\nIn the release, CEI general counsel Sam Kazman stated, \u201cOur document requests go to the heart of an important question: What did HHS think of Obamacare subsidies, and when did it think it? Given the current debate over this issue, HHS has no business stonewalling our request.\u201d\n\nThe release points out that a recent CEI paper I wrote, Beyond Gruber: How HHS Flip-Flopped on Federal Exchange Subsidies, demonstrates \u201can extensive paper trail of HHS documents indicates the agency originally interpreted Obamacare as permitting subsidies only on state-established insurance exchanges. HHS did not change its view until more than two years after the law passed, when it had to deal with the political fallout of most states refusing to set up their own exchanges.\u201d\n\nCEI states that its FOIA requests were filed in early September 2014 and argues: \u201cTo date, more than three months later, the agency has done nothing more than to assign tracking numbers to two of the requests and claim \u2018unusual and exceptional circumstances,\u2019\u201d said CEI attorney Hans Bader. \u201cIn terms of what we\u2019re entitled to under FOIA, this delay just doesn\u2019t cut it.\u201d\n\nThe Supreme Court will decide whether the Affordable Care Act law authorizes tax credits on federal exchanges next year in the King v. Burwell case. CEI is coordinating both the King case and the D.C. Circuit Halbig v. Burwell case.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The FOIA requests seek documents related to HHS's development of tax credit calculators on Healthcare.gov.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "The FOIA requests seek documents related to HHS's development of tax credit calculators on Healthcare.gov.", "title": "Lawsuit Seeks HHS Documents on Obamacare Tax Credits", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2014/12/obamacare-prices-2015-ap.jpg", "height": 479}, "updated_time": "2014-12-18T17:25:55-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2014/12/18/cei-files-lawsuit-against-hhs-to-get-healthcare-gov-tax-credit-calculator-documents/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The FOIA requests seek documents related to HHS's development of tax credit calculators on Healthcare.gov.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2014/12/obamacare-prices-2015-ap.jpg", "title": "Lawsuit Seeks HHS Documents on Obamacare Tax Credits", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "affordable care act, health insurance, healthcare.gov, Sylvia Mathews Burwell,Big Government, IRS, Obamacare,obamacare tax credit", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2014-12-18T17:16:20-07:00", "section": "Big Government", "modified_time": "2014-12-18T17:25:55-07:00", "tag": "Sylvia Mathews Burwell", "categories": "Big Government,Obamacare,IRS"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "The FOIA requests\u2026 seek documents related to the agencies\u2019 development of tax credit calculators on Healthcare.gov.\u201dSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERIt is important to note that for an exchange website such as Healthcare.gov to offer tax credits, it must have a tax credit calculator that allows individuals to view the actual cost of their coverage after tax credits have been applied to their premiums.\nIn the release, CEI general counsel Sam Kazman stated, \u201cOur document requests go to the heart of an important question: What did HHS think of Obamacare subsidies, and when did it think it?\n\u201cIn terms of what we\u2019re entitled to under FOIA, this delay just doesn\u2019t cut it.\u201dThe Supreme Court will decide whether the Affordable Care Act law authorizes tax credits on federal exchanges next year in the King v.
