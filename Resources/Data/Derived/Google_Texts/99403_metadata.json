We\u2019re free in America.\u201d Her anger stunned me to silence, as I watched her brusquely walk away. I was 15. Raised by my mother to be proud of my identity, I felt it all stripped from me in that one moment.\n\nRecently, I read about Tanya Smart\u2019s harrowing experiences in the Daily Telegraph. Smart, a non-Muslim, is female reporter who wore a niqab\u2014a word she frequently alternated with burqa (the former is a veil, the latter covers the entire face and body)\u2014to \u201csee how people would react\u201d as she went about her day in Sydney, Australia. I felt like I was 15 all over again\u2014palms sweaty and nervous\u2014as I read her account of how she felt \u201cstraight away [like] I did not fit in\u201d as a visible minority in Sydney. She then described her walk around Lakemba, a Muslim neighborhood where she felt like an outsider in her T-shirt and pants. It was only when Smart covered herself in the niqab that she felt safe, though she reported feeling afraid of the reaction she would get from the immigrants around her once they realized she was actually Australian.\n\nAs I finished reading the article, it took me a moment to regain composure before frustration kicked in. This, Smart said, was the most terrifying experience she has ever endured, rife with moments of alienation and feeling like an Other. She had created a reality she believed Muslim women\u2014especially covered Muslim women\u2014go through daily, one in which every move is cloaked with fear of reprisal, where strength and empowerment have no place. What was even more disconcerting to me was the fear Smart expressed of being discovered and exposed as an Australian Muslim, as though the two realities are so distinct that they can never overlap. What was more, she was concerned that she was going to be exposed as a fraud to the Muslims around her, masquerading as one of them.\n\nMore from DAME: \u201cHelp! I\u2019ve Become My Mom\u2019s Sugar Mama!\u201d\n\nSmart\u2019s experience presumes that all Muslim women experience a similar personal crisis with regard to their religious and national identities. Can a non-Muslim woman dress up as a Muslim woman and really expect to experience life as a Muslim woman might? Why would Smart\u2019s portrait of Islamic life gain such recognition\u2014why not ask a Muslim woman about her life, instead? And reducing what it means to be a Muslim woman down to a piece of fabric\u2014is that how the non-Muslim world sees Muslim women? There is obviously more to us than that, and of course, many different sects within the faith, as with all religions.\n\nWithin the Muslim faith, women are asked to dress and behave modestly. For many, that means wearing the hijab, a scarf that covers the hair. Within America, only 43 percent of Muslim women choose to cover, the rest choosing not to do so. For some Muslim women, choosing to cover their face with a niqab is their way of covering. Far fewer wear the burqa, which covers the head and body entirely. Hijab is considered foreign and alien to the West.\n\nSmart isn\u2019t the only journalist to conduct this experiment\u2014she is part of a tradition of similar undertakings, each reporter attempting to provide a glimpse into the world of covered Muslim women. In 2010, a Kentucky woman wore a hijab for a month, revealing an experience that \u201csilenced, but simultaneously \u2026 brought unforgettable words.\u201d The writer found that the experience made her uneasy, but was unable to pinpoint certain encounters because they were rarely transparent. The writer concluded that \u201cwhat you see and hear from the media is fallible\u2014if you want the truth, talk to a Muslim.\u201d Yet her very experiment failed to do that. In 2011, an editor for The Huffington Post chronicled her endeavor to become \u201cIslamic,\u201d describing the niqab she chose to purchase as \u201csomething an executioner would wear.\u201d Throughout her piece, she says things like \u201cthe sight of fully veiled women has become disturbingly familiar\u201d and \u201cthere are people right here who want to shroud women \u2026 to make us all submissive and invisible.\u201d In 2012, a VICE journalist decided to explore \u201cwhat life was like for women who have been consigned to wear the least-revealing piece of clothing of all time,\u201d her article sexualizing what she felt life was like for a woman in niqab.\n\nMore from DAME: \u201cJust Because I\u2019m Pregnant Doesn\u2019t Mean I Want Your Advice\u201d\n\nThe reality is that the Western media rarely listens to covered Muslim women attempting to share their lives and realities, and instead asks their readers to heed the words of those who are privileged enough to be given the voice, rather than having to fight for one, and who have appropriated those experiences as their own.", "article_metadata": {"description": "I committed to wearing a hijab at the age of 10.
