They are very inarticulate. The use of political gimmicks to obscure parts of the law does not prove voters are stupid. The average American rightfully does not follow the daily legislative process of lawmaking. If anything, Gruber\u2019s comments are an indictment of the media which allows politicians on both sides of the aisle to get away with political tricks.\n\n2. The law was passed in a pretty transparent manner. Gruber is flat out wrong when he implies that the law was not passed in a transparent way. Even media coverage of the law, while far from perfect, was pretty darn good, at least compared to coverage of other major pieces of legislation. A month ago, Jonathan Cohn further explained why conservatives are wrong that Obama misrepresented the law.\n\n3. The bill was crafted to minimize its political repercussions. Gruber is right on this point. The mandate was carefully written so that it would not be called a tax, even though the Congressional Budget Office scored it as a revenue generator. The Supreme Court eventually blew that argument apart. The White House imposed a tax on insurance companies\u2014the Cadillac tax\u2014when they sell high-priced insurance plans instead of taxing the plans directly. Consumers pay the tax in either case but the former is more politically palatable. Democratic and Republican policymakers craft legislation to reduce the political blowback all the time. Gruber is simply stating, in unacceptable terms, what everyone in Washington knows to be true.\n\nThe Republicans\u2019 goal in Tuesday\u2019s hearing was to prod Gruber for further evidence to undermine the law. But Gruber was not going to provide it. As congressman after congressman asked him what he meant by his comments, he threw himself under the bus. He apologized ad nauseam, said he was trying to prove his intellect by insulting the American people and called his comments \u201cinexcusable.\u201d He refused to call himself an architect of the law\u2014although he undoubtedly was\u2014and downplayed his involvement by referring to himself as an economic adviser.\n\nThe combative hearing earned many Republican lawmakers good sound bites and conservative websites published videos of Gruber repeatedly avoiding questions such as how much he earned from federal and state contracts. But it left many of them frustrated. Gruber accomplished his goal: Nothing he said added to our understanding of how the law was passed.\n\nA much larger worry is that Gruber\u2019s experience will signal to him and other academics involved in lawmaking that they are now political pawns in a much larger game. Even at an academic conference years after legislation became law, Gruber\u2019s comments still threatened to undermine Obamacare. It\u2019s hard to imagine that he will speak off the cuff ever again. That\u2019s a major loss, as his willingness to speak candidly about the policymaking process has undoubtedly help countless people understand why legislation is crafted in such suboptimal ways\u2014why the Cadillac tax was used or the mandate was not called a tax.\n\nLater on in the hearing Tuesday, Republicans showed their frustration with Gruber\u2019s vague answers and refusal to answer straightforward questions. \u201cIt does appear that you have progressed in your ability to be political,\u201d Representative Tim Walberg said. \u201cYou answer questions better than any politician sitting at this desk today. \u2026 You have progressed from not simply talking off the cuff and making stupid statements to now being entirely political.\u201d The blame for that, though, does not fall on Gruber. It falls on House Republicans who have given him no other option.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "MIT economist and Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber took a beating Tuesday when he testified before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee about his comments on the legislative history of the Affordable Care Act. \u201cAre you stupid?\u201d committee chair Darrell Issa said to start the hearing.
