(See how your member of Congress voted.)\n\nThe vote clears a path for the chamber to vote on the legislation sponsored by Rep. Stephen Fincher, R-Tenn. Under Fincher\u2019s legislation, the 81-year-old bank would be reauthorized through 2019. Lawmakers are expected to vote on his bill tomorrow.\n\nDebate on the discharge petition brought fiery statements from lawmakers both opposing and supporting Ex-Im, as conservatives criticized the petition\u2019s language for not allowing any amendments.\n\n\u201cThis is not regular order,\u201d said Rep. Mick Mulvaney, R-S.C. \u201cThis is shoving something down the American people\u2019s throats.\u201d\n\nHouse Financial Services Chairman Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, also pushed back against the process.\n\n\u201cIf this is going to come to the floor, every member ought to be allowed to have an amendment, and we ought to reject this discharge petition,\u201d the Texas Republican said.\n\nHensarling\u2019s committee has jurisdiction over the bank.\n\nFincher, by contrast, called on his GOP colleagues to join him in support of the discharge petition.\n\n\u201cI ask my colleagues to join me in returning power to the rank-and-file members by voting on the motion to discharge and supporting American jobs,\u201d he said, speaking on the House floor.\n\nThough the majority of House members supported the discharge motion, Fincher\u2019s legislation faces uncertainty in the Senate. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky has stressed that he will not bring a standalone bill reauthorizing Ex-Im to the Senate floor.\n\nAt the beginning of the month, 42 Republicans worked with House Minority Leader Steny Hoyer of Maryland and other Democrats to support the discharge petition. The petition received the 218 signatures needed to move the petition forward.\n\nDischarge petitions are rarely successful and can be considered by the House only on the second and fourth Mondays of a month. The process was used last in 2002 to fast-track campaign finance legislation.\n\nIf a petition receives the 218 signatures needed and the discharge motion passes the House, legislation\u2014Ex-Im\u2019s reauthorization, in this case\u2014is brought directly to the floor for a vote, bypassing both committees and House leadership.\n\nThe discharge petition was met with opposition from a majority of Republicans in the House. On Friday, Hensarling and Rules Chairman Pete Sessions, both from Texas, sent a letter calling on members of the Republican conference to vote against the discharge petition.\n\nThe two committee chairmen stressed that both a majority of the Financial Services Committee, which has jurisdiction over the bank, and a majority of the majority party\u2014Republicans\u2014oppose Ex-Im\u2019s reauthorization.\n\n\u201cUltimately, it\u2019s about whether a minority of our conference will find common cause with Democrats whenever we have an internal disagreement, use this uncommon, extreme discharge petition process, and force a vote when a majority of the majority does not want a vote,\u201d Hensarling and Sessions wrote.\n\nEx-Im\u2019s charter expired June 30 after a year of debate among its supporters and opponents.\n\nThose who oppose the bank, like Hensarling, argue that it served as an engine of corporate welfare and cronyism.\n\nBy contrast, its supporters believe that Ex-Im helped small businesses compete globally and created jobs in the United States.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The House of Representatives moved one step closer to bringing the Export-Import Bank back from the dead.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The House of Representatives moved one step closer to bringing the Export-Import Bank back from the dead.", "title": "House Clears Way for Vote Reviving Export-Import Bank", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151026_ExImVote_Quinn.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-10-27T19:31:42+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1ibmVoZ"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The House of Representatives moved one step closer to bringing the Export-Import Bank back from the dead.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151026_ExImVote_Quinn.jpg"}, "title": "House Clears Way for Vote Reviving Export-Import Bank", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "cronyism,House of Representatives", "published_time": "2015-10-26T21:38:55+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-27T19:31:42+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Export-Import Bank, Ex-Im, Stephen Fincher, Jeb Hensarling, Pete Sessions, Financial Services Committee, Rules Committee"}, "article_summary": "The vote clears a path for the chamber to vote on the legislation sponsored by Rep.
