While robbing Mosul\u2019s central bank and a number of others in the region, the Sunni militant group also managed to steal U.S.-made vehicles, arms, and ammunition--which arguably present a much more powerful international message than their stunning amount of cash now on hand.\n\nRelated: The Need for U.S. Special Forces in Iraq\n\nMore than a week after the siege in Mosul, the ISIS fighters claim sway over a giant swatch of land stretching from Aleppo to Fallujah, and promise to march on to the Iraqi capital of Baghdad.\n\nOn Sunday, ISIS took to Twitter, claiming to have massacred 1,700 Iraqi Shia air force recruits in Tikrit (former President Saddam Hussein\u2019s hometown). The State Department, in a statement, said that \u201cone of the primary goals of ISIL (Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant) is to set fear into the hearts of all Iraqis and drive sectarian division among its people.\u201d The statement went on the promise that the U.S. will \u201cdo its part to help Iraq move beyond this crisis.\u201d\n\nBut just what the U.S. administration is prepared to do remains an open \u2013 and hotly debated \u2013 question. As he weighs his options, President Obama has ruled out U.S. boots on the ground inside Iraq but still is considering a return, at least temporarily, to some form of combat posture even though his rise to national political prominence was defined by his promise to end U.S. military involvement in the country where what he calls George W. Bush\u2019s misguided war of choice cost the lives of 4,487 U.S. military personnel and over $1 trillion.\n\nRelated: Market Volatility Likely with Focus on Fed and Iraq\n\nThe ISIS march is again raising profound questions about the training and readiness of Iraqi troops, despite a 2012 inspector general report that claimed roughly $25 billion was spent on \"training, equipping and sustaining\" the Iraqi security forces. The New York Times reported that Iraq has also put billions of its own money into its security forces, purchasing weapons ranging from Apache helicopter gunships, to F-16 fighter jets, to Hellfire missiles.\n\nNonetheless, Iraq\u2019s army appears utterly unprepared \u2013 or unwilling - to defend itself, despite the fact it greatly outnumbers ISIS\u2019 estimated 3,000 to 5,000 fighters.\n\nAs the President weighs his options, a new Iraq debate is raging in Washington.\n\nRelated: Obama Warns of \u2018Wake Up Call for Iraq\u2019\n\nAppearing on CNN\u2019s State of the Union Republican Senator Lindsey Graham called Obama a \u201cdelusional, detached president.\u201d He went on to say, \"The stubborn-headed president we have, who thinks he knows better than everybody else, who withdrew troops and exposed this country to the inevitable, needs to change his policies quickly.\u201d\n\nIt is ISIS\u2019 stated mission that has the White House so worried, and the president\u2019s critics demanding he weigh more muscular responses.\n\nJessica Lewis, an ISIS expert at the Institute for the Study of War, told Time, \u201cSectarian civil war is the enabler\u2026They want to set conditions in Iraq that look like Syria so they can set up an Islamic state.\u201d\n\nSince January, Iraqi security forces have been battling ISIS in the western Anbar province\u2019s two biggest cities--Fallujah and Ramadi. All the while, Nouri al-Maliki, Iraq\u2019s Prime Minister, has been publically accusing both Saudi Arabia and Qatar of funneling money towards ISIS.\n\nRelated: Could Hillary Clinton Have Prevented the Crisis in Iraq?\n\n\"I accuse them of inciting and encouraging the terrorist movements,\u201d al-Maliki told France 24. \u201cI accuse them of supporting them politically and in the media, of supporting them with money and by buying weapons for them.\u201d\n\nIn the past, the ISIS has managed to pay for its fighters and weapons through private donors, reportedly having money funneled through the likes of Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar. But as they took control over more land, they began acting as somewhat of a de-facto state, levying taxes and customs duties\u2014all the while, taking advantage of weak money laundering protections.\n\nMore money started flowing in as they got their hands in the oil industry. They\u2019ve managed to find business in the extraction and sale of oil in towns like Syria's Deir al-Zur Province, and most recently, in Iraq\u2019s northern city of Baiji.\n\nAccording to recent reporting by The Fiscal Time\u2019s David Francis, a major reason why the financing of terrorist networks is difficult to stop is because many of their transactions happen informally, and in cash. Francis was told by members of al-Shabab, the Somali al-Qaeda affiliate, that they finance operations with friendly banks, such as those owned by Somalis. They also receive money from international supporters\u2014mainly from Saudi Arabia\u2014all the while bribing politicians to allow them to do business under the table.\n\nRelated: How the Collapse of Iraq Would Affect America\n\nBecause of the reported $430 million take from the Mosul bank, the financing of al-Shabab now could pale in comparison to ISIS. According to Money Jihad, as of 2011, the Taliban was estimated to have between $70 to $400 million; Hezbollah, between $200 million to $500 million; Farc, between $80 million to $350 million; and Hamas, an estimated $70 million.\n\nIraqi governor, Atheel al-Nujaifi, told NBC News that the heist makes ISIS the \u201cworld\u2019s richest terrorist group.\u201d It\u2019s a big leap from the mere $30 million budget that the CIA estimated al-Qaeda had on 9/11.\n\nIt begs the question: what will--and what can--ISIS spend the money on?\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "What does a terrorist network with nearly $430 million worth of stolen moneybags fille", "title": "Terrorist Tycoons on a Horrific March to Baghdad", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/06/16/Terrorist-Tycoons-Horrific-March-Baghdad", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/06162014_Baghdad_Volunteer_Iraqis.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/06/16/Terrorist-Tycoons-Horrific-March-Baghdad", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/06162014_Baghdad_Volunteer_Iraqis.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "What does a terrorist network with nearly $430 million worth of stolen moneybags fille", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc032\"", "article_summary": "What does a terrorist network with nearly $430 million worth of stolen moneybags filled with cash and gold bullion do?\n\"I accuse them of inciting and encouraging the terrorist movements,\u201d al-Maliki told France 24.\nAll the while, Nouri al-Maliki, Iraq\u2019s Prime Minister, has been publically accusing both Saudi Arabia and Qatar of funneling money towards ISIS.\nOn Sunday, ISIS took to Twitter, claiming to have massacred 1,700 Iraqi Shia air force recruits in Tikrit (former President Saddam Hussein\u2019s hometown).\nNonetheless, Iraq\u2019s army appears utterly unprepared \u2013 or unwilling - to defend itself, despite the fact it greatly outnumbers ISIS\u2019 estimated 3,000 to 5,000 fighters."}
