The Shoah Foundation collects and preserves video testimonies of survivors and witnesses to the Holocaust, and houses a nearly 52,000 testimonies in its archive.

Spielberg was among the president's top donors in 2012, donating $1 million to Priorities USA, the super-PAC backing the president's re-election.

While in California, Obama is also slated to attend a fundraiser jointly benefiting the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee at the home of Alan Horn, the chairman of the Walt Disney Studios. According to The Associated Press, tickets to the dinner range from $10,000 per person to just under $65,000 for a couple.
