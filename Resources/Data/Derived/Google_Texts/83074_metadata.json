(Fox News)\n\nFox News host Shep Smith grilled Republican strategist Doug Heye on Wednesday, arguing that Republicans created the conditions leading up to Donald Trump becoming the front-runner for the party\u2019s presidential nomination.\n\nTrump\u2019s supporters, Smith said, are part of a second conservative party \u2014 people \u201cwho believe that they\u2019ve been lied to by the establishment for cycle after cycle, [saying] \u2018We\u2019re gonna repeal and replace Obamacare.\u2019 Every single person who knows one thing knew that you weren\u2019t gonna repeal and replace Obamacare. Everybody knew it, even the people who were saying it.\u201d\n\nDespite that, he added, establishment GOP lawmakers kept saying they would gut the Affordable Care Act while not being able to do it.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t trust you anymore. Do you blame them?\u201d Smith said of conservative voters. \u201cWere they children and you the parent? Wouldn\u2019t the child run away at 16?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think people have a great reason to be angry at both sides of Washington,\u201d Heye responded. \u201cBut the House and Senate have voted to replace Obamacare. Obviously, we need a Republican president who\u2019s going to actually sign that repeal.\u201d\n\nHeye also said he was \u201chopeful\u201d that efforts would increase to \u201cexpose\u201d Trump\u2019s record as the Republican primaries continue.\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019ll be running against both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump,\u201d Smith said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be voting for a constitutional conservative on election day,\u201d Heye replied.\n\n\u201cBut what you just described is a dual campaign \u2014 a two-front war. One war on Benghazi and emails against Hillary Clinton; another war against Donald Trump over what he said about black people and women and his university. Those two-front wars are hard to fight. We learned that recently.\u201d\n\nWatch the interview, as aired on Wednesday, below.\n\nWatch the latest video at video.foxnews.com", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Shep-Smith-030216-800x430.jpg", "height": 430}, "title": "Fox\u2019s Shep Smith shreds strategist: Republican Party lies gave rise to Donald Trump"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cSo you\u2019ll be running against both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump,\u201d Smith said.\nOne war on Benghazi and emails against Hillary Clinton; another war against Donald Trump over what he said about black people and women and his university.\n(Fox News)Fox News host Shep Smith grilled Republican strategist Doug Heye on Wednesday, arguing that Republicans created the conditions leading up to Donald Trump becoming the front-runner for the party\u2019s presidential nomination.\n\u201cBut the House and Senate have voted to replace Obamacare.\nShepard Smith interviews GOP strategist Doug Heye on 'Shepard Smith Reporting' on March 2, 2016."}
