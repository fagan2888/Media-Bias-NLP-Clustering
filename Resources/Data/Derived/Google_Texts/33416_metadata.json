Among those principles is the idea that the government must increase the amount of unlicensed spectrum available and the philosophy that it \u201cis important for all participants in the unlicensed space, both existing and new entrants, to coexist and play well together.\u201d\n\nCritics of the technology, however, say it has not been properly vetted. Those critics, led by the cable industry, say the technology could clog the spectrum used for Wi-Fi.\n\nBut supporters say their testing shows this isn\u2019t the case \u2014 and the technology should be deployed soon to meet growing demand for broadband.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a demand now, we should be getting technology out and meeting that demand,\u201d said Steve Sharkey, a T-Mobile executive.\n\nNo consumer devices exist yet that use LTE-U, but Verizon says it plans to roll out products using the technology in the near future.\n\nThe coalition will use \"speaking engagements, dialogue with policymakers, and consumer education\" to promote the technology.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "A coalition will promote technology that allows cellphones to use unlicensed spectrum.", "description": "A coalition will promote technology that allows cellphones to use unlicensed spectrum.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "David McCabe", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "A coalition will promote technology that allows cellphones to use unlicensed spectrum.", "title": "Verizon, AT&T joining to promote new wireless technology", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/255141-verizon-att-among-members-of-new-wireless-tech-coalition", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/cellphone_getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T05:25-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/255141-verizon-att-among-members-of-new-wireless-tech-coalition", "dcterms.date": "2015-09-28T11:18-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "David McCabe", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-28T11:18:59-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/255141-verizon-att-among-members-of-new-wireless-tech-coalition", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "A coalition will promote technology that allows cellphones to use unlicensed spectrum.", "card": "summary", "title": "Verizon, AT&T joining to promote new wireless technology"}, "dcterms.title": "Verizon, AT&T joining to promote new wireless technology"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcd1f\"", "article_summary": "Major wireless carriers and industry groups are joining in a new coalition to promote a technology they say would help them expand their networks.\nThe coalition will use \"speaking engagements, dialogue with policymakers, and consumer education\" to promote the technology.\nThose critics, led by the cable industry, say the technology could clog the spectrum used for Wi-Fi.\nNo consumer devices exist yet that use LTE-U, but Verizon says it plans to roll out products using the technology in the near future.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a demand now, we should be getting technology out and meeting that demand,\u201d said Steve Sharkey, a T-Mobile executive."}
