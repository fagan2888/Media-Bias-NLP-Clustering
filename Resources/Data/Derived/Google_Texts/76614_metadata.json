He was one of three Redskins to reach the Pro Bowl in 2013. He might prove to be the most important cog in new coach Jay Gruden\u2019s offense. So entering this summer\u2019s training camp, the third-year running back was due to get his fair share of recognition.\n\nSEE ALSO: Kirk Cousins on Kyle Shanahan: \u2018I think he\u2019ll do good things for Cleveland\u2019\n\nAnd yet, nothing has changed.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s still Alfred, man,\u201d fullback Darrel Young said. \u201cHe\u2019s always been behind the scenes because of the attention that Robert gets \u2014 in a good way.\u201d\n\nWhile Griffin and star offseason acquisition DeSean Jackson have received the majority of the attention so far, Morris has quietly improved his route-running skills out of the backfield. He is expected to be a more integral part of the passing game this year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not really that big of a deal,\u201d Morris said of his role as a receiver. \u201cI\u2019ve been wanting to do this for a long time so I\u2019m just thankful that they are allowing me to do that and giving me chances, and just building that trust and confidence in me.\u201d\n\nMorris only had nine catches last season and 11 as a rookie. In college, it was more of the same. He left Florida Atlantic University with a total of 30 receptions in 36 games.\n\nMorris said his focus has been adjusting to coverages, learning the finer points of running routes, and creating separation from defenders. Actually catching the ball is the easy part.\n\nTo improve in these departments, Morris occasionally leaves his positional drills to catch passes from Griffin at the beginning of practice. The extra work has shown in 7-on-7 drills when he is lined up across from a linebacker.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been snagging balls,\u201d Young said. \u201cCatching everything.\u201d\n\nGruden referred to Morris as \u201csteady Eddie\u201d and said he has taken the new pass-heavy offensive philosophy in stride.\n\n\u201cYou never hear a peep from him,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cIf I throw the ball 10 times in a row in practice and he\u2019s in there, he doesn\u2019t say a word. A lot of guys would be ripping their chinstrap off, \u2018Give me the ball!\u2019 But Alfred is a total team player and a total class act. And he\u2019ll get his touches, no worries about that.\u201d\n\nMorris racked up 1,613 yards and 13 rushing touchdowns in 2012 to help lead the Redskins to the playoffs. He followed that up last year with 1,275 rushing yards and seven scores.\n\nThe Redskins are counting on Morris to be the same productive runner again this season, creating a unique form of pressure. Fans and coaches expect him to match and perhaps exceed his already high levels of performance. But Morris said his mentality hasn\u2019t changed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the NFL,\u201d Morris said. \u201cThere\u2019s already pressure. It\u2019s already stressful to be perfect and just come out here and execute every day because, if not, you have a young guy nipping at your heels, waiting for you to mess up.\u201d\n\nYoung raved about Morris\u2018 value to the offense and demeanor on the field. The fullback said Morris likely would have been the rookie of the year in 2012 if it hadn\u2019t been for Griffin, then added: \u201cHe\u2019s one of those guys that you root for all the time.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if Morris gets enough credit for his play, Young paused.\n\n\u201cHe gets the attention from the guys he needs to, and that\u2019s the guys on the field,\u201d he said. \u201cWe support him. We have the utmost respect for him. And we trust him when he\u2019s out there.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Again overshadowed by Robert Griffin III and the addition of DeSean Jackson, the Redskins' running back has made important improvements as a pass-catcher this summer.", "Author": "Tom Schad", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Again overshadowed by Robert Griffin III and the addition of DeSean Jackson, the Redskins\u2019 running back has made important improvements as a pass-catcher this summer.", "title": "Alfred Morris quietly improves as a receiver for the Washington Redskins", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/aug/16/alfred-morris-quietly-improves-receiver-washington/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/07/24/redskins_20140724_028.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/07/24/redskins_20140724_028.jpg", "title": "Alfred Morris quietly improves as a receiver for the Washington Redski", "description": "Again overshadowed by Robert Griffin III and the addition of DeSean Jackson, the Redskins' running back has made important improvements as a pass-catcher this summer.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Sports, Alf Morris, Robert Griffin Iii, Darrel Young, Jay Gruden"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde132\"", "article_summary": "When Alfred Morris first arrived at Redskins training camp a little more than two years ago, he was widely overshadowed by another rookie, No.\nThe Redskins are counting on Morris to be the same productive runner again this season, creating a unique form of pressure.\nDuring his two years in the NFL, Morris has rushed for more yards than anyone except Adrian Peterson.\nWhen Morris arrived at training camp last year after a sensational first season, he was again overshadowed by Griffin\u2019s return from offseason knee surgery.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not really that big of a deal,\u201d Morris said of his role as a receiver."}
