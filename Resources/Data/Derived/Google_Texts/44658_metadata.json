This automatically gets her plenty of positive feedback on the online site.\n\nBut what many desperate and creepy dudes on Tinder \u2014 the online hook-up app \u2014 don\u2019t know is that Nicole isn\u2019t real, but rather a profile used to educate online daters about men\u2019s health during the month of June. And that she's a dude.\n\nTinder provides both men and women a chance to scour their options for quick hook-ups that are in close proximity to their area. But now it\u2019s a chance for guys to be reminded of checking their blood pressure, going to their doctor\u2019s, and paying heed to the importance of vaccination, blood glucose, cholesterol, as well as cancer \u2014 instead of sexting.\n\nNicole is the conception of two dudes \u2014 Vincent Mak and Colby Spear, who were working as creative interns at Razorfish when they came up with the idea of Matches for Men\u2019s Health as a personal project. \u201cSteering the conversations towards men\u2019s health was a fun challenge for us,\u201d Spear told Boston.com. \u201cAs a copywriter, I regularly have to think of funny lines for ideas, and Vince is just always a witty guy. We thought of responses to the pick up lines on the fly.\u201d He continues: \u201cNurse Nicole is a 100% stock-photo, fictitious person. When we originally created the Tinder account for her, Vince and I set it up so that we both had her account on our phones. This allowed us both to talk to guys at any time.\u201d\n\nApparently the fact that Nicole\u2019s main picture looks like it was downloaded off Shutterstock isn\u2019t stopping guys from hitting on her, sending her texts along the lines of, \u201cHey sexy,\u201d or \u201cAre you ready for a baby oil massage?\u201d Nicole\u2019s responses, meanwhile, lead to hints about prostate exams, colonoscopies, and other \u201cpreventable men\u2019s health problems.\u201d On the Matches for Mens Health website, Nicole is described as \u201ca Tinder profile created to raise awareness about men\u2019s health month in June.\u201d The website says: \u201cFor the month of June, Nicole is enduring terrible pick-up lines, facing extreme male desperation, and talking dirty to dirtbags in the name of men\u2019s health.\u201d\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provides men with ways to celebrate National Men\u2019s Health Week, which occurs from June 9-15: Take a bike ride, toss a ball, eat less salt, and consume some more veggies. And prostate health is possibly one of the most important things for guys to pay attention to: over 30 million men suffer from negative prostate conditions. Every year, 230,000 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer, and prostatitis is another major disease affecting men. The prostate is a gland in the male reproductive system that is located below the bladder and in front of the rectum, according to the National Cancer Institute.\n\nNicole is a \u201cgood way to start talking about things men don\u2019t like talking about,\u201d one commenter, Captain Murphy, writes on ABC News. Not only is Tinder about one night stands, but maybe it\u2019s become a vehicle for spreading information about health as well.
