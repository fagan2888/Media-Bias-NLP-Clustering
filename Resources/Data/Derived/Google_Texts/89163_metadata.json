A defensive approach was employed because the three women and several of their dogs had already escaped the fire. Three other dogs and several rabbits that were in the home were unaccounted for at the time of this report.\n\nFour people lived in the house, the tree women (aged 87, 68 and 66) and a 16-year-old girl.\n\nThe Northwest Fire District's Community Assistance Program and the Southern Arizona chapter of the American Red Cross will assist them with shelter and other needs.\n\nNWFD investigators were unable to access the area of the fire's origin because of significant structure damage and instability, so the official cause of the fire is undetermined. Investigators suspect the use of a portable electric heater as a potential cause.\n\nDamages were estimated at approximately $70,000.\n\nCopyright 2016 Tucson News Now.
