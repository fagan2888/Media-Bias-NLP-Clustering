He\u2019s in wait-and-see mode regarding outfielder Carlos Gonzalez and left-hander starter Brett Anderson.\n\nTulo underwent surgery Friday to repair a torn labrum in his left hip and faces a recovery period of about five months. It\u2019s the same surgery former first baseman Todd Helton underwent in the summer of 2012.\n\nAccording to Dugger, Tulowitzki emerged from the operation in good shape.\n\n\u201cIt was actually pretty cut and dry as far has hip surgeries go,\u201d he said Saturday. \u201cHopefully it provides some stability that allows us to continue to do some of the same strengthening exercises that he\u2019s been doing.\u201d\n\nEven since Tulowitzki tore a left quadriceps tendon in 2008, he\u2019s had issues with muscle strength and stability. Dugger is hopeful the operation will help change some of that.\n\n\u201cYou always have a little bit of instability, but there are plenty of professional athletes who take care of the tear and have very successful careers and have no issues,\u201d Dugger said.\n\nHelton\u2019s surgery helped the first baseman increase his mobility and lessened some of the first basemen\u2019s chronic back pain, Dugger said.\n\nGonzalez will undergo surgery on his left patella tendon Monday in Frisco. Dugger said the full extent of the damage to CarGo\u2019s knee won\u2019t be know until the operation.\n\n\u201cYou have some diseased tissue in the middle third of the patella,\u201d Dugger said. \u201cYou don\u2019t know if you are going to go in there and find debris and clean it up, or if you are going to have to split (the tendon) and suture it back together.\u201d\n\nBy \u201cdiseased,\u201d Dugger said he was referring to \u201ctissue that has either been torn or split and it\u2019s just kind of chewed up and mangled.\u201d\n\nAnderson underwent surgery Thursday to repair a ruptured disc in his lower back. He\u2019s limited to light walking for the next two weeks before he can begin light exercise.\n\n\u201cIt was a very, very large size disc, so we are going to be a little more conservative,\u201d Dugger said \u201cHe blew out his back. It was an acute rupture that just happened. This was not something that was there before.\u201d\n\nFootnotes. The Rockies made a number of roster moves Saturday. Outfielder Michael Cuddyer (shoulder) was recalled from the 60-day disabled list, and right-handed reliever Brooks Brown was recalled from Triple-A. Brooks filled the roster spot for right-hander Tommy Kahnle, who was placed on the 15-day DL because of lingering right shoulder inflammation. To make room for Cuddyer, first baseman Ben Paulsen was optioned to Triple-A and Anderson was moved from the 15-day to the 60-day DL. \u2026 First baseman Justin Morneau was a late scratch Saturday night because of a stiff neck. \u2026 Second baseman DJ LeMahieu (sore ankle) did not start Saturday\u2019s game.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nGame 1: Reds\u2019 Mat Latos (4-3, 2.95 ERA) at Rockies\u2019 Jordan Lyles (6-1, 3.70), 2:10 p.m. Sunday, ROOT; 630 AM\n\nFor the Reds to have any chance to remain in the postseason hunt, they are going to need quality starts from Latos, a 6-foot-6, 245-pound right-hander. Though he began the season on the disabled list, he brings a 0.94 WHIP into Coors Field. Over his last three starts, he\u2019s 2-0 with a 2.08 ERA. In eight games against the Rockies, Latos is 5-2 with a 3.63 ERA. In five career starts at Coors, he\u2019s 3-1 with a 3.21 ERA. The only two Colorado players with much experience against Latos are Carlos Gonzalez and Troy Tulowitzki, and both of them are out for the rest of the season because of injuries.\n\nGame 2: Reds\u2019 Dylan Axelrod (season debut) at Rockies\u2019 Yohan Flande (0-5, 5.36), 7:10 p.m. Sunday, ROOT; 630 AM\n\nFlande, the emergency lefty called up from Triple-A Colorado Springs for his June 25 debut, is still waiting for his first big-league win. Despite his 5.36 ERA \u2014 only slightly higher than the starters\u2019 cumulative 5.03 ERA \u2014 he has pitched well enough on several occasions to earn a victory. Trouble is, in seven starts, the Rockies have provided him with just 14 total runs of support. Flande generally handles hitters well in the first three innings, but he tends to get hit hard the second or third time through the order.\n\nMonday: Off\n\nTuesday: Royals\u2019 James Shields (11-6, 3.29 ERA) at Rockies\u2019 Tyler Matzek (2-8, 5.50), 6:40 p.m., ROOT\n\nWednesday: Royals\u2019 Danny Duffy (8-10, 2.60) at Rockies\u2019 Jorge De La Rosa (12-8, 4.32), 6:40 p.m., ROOT\n\nThursday: Off\n\nPatrick Saunders, The Denver Post", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Troy Tulowitzki faces five-month recovery after hip surgery", "title": "Troy Tulowitzki faces five-month recovery after hip surgery", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/16/troy-tulowitzki-faces-five-month-recovery-after-hip-surgery/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140815__troy-tulowitzki-at-batp1-1.jpg", "height": 451}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140815__troy-tulowitzki-at-batp1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-16T17:12:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T09:12:39+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Troy Tulowitzki"}, "article_summary": "According to Dugger, Tulowitzki emerged from the operation in good shape.\nTulo underwent surgery Friday to repair a torn labrum in his left hip and faces a recovery period of about five months.\nIn eight games against the Rockies, Latos is 5-2 with a 3.63 ERA.\nHelton\u2019s surgery helped the first baseman increase his mobility and lessened some of the first basemen\u2019s chronic back pain, Dugger said.\nRockies trainer Keith Dugger offers an optimistic prognosis on Troy Tulowitzki."}
