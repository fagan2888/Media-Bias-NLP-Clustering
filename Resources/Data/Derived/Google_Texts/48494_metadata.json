The 113th Congress was pathetically ineffective and barely more popular than the Black Death. The 114th Congress promises to outdo the last.\n\nBut Rand Paul thinks he has an idea that will make Congress more effective, and he \u201cunveiled\u201d it as an unofficial response to Obama\u2019s State of the Union Address.\n\nNobody is jumping all over it, and you have to ask yourself why. Let\u2019s take a look at that question.\n\nDoes Paul suggest that Congress work longer hours? No. That would be silly, wouldn\u2019t it? Does he suggest they actually work while they\u2019re in DC instead of suing Obama and trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act? No! Don\u2019t be absurd. Well, surely he thinks they should stop pursuing phony scandals and wasteful hearings! I laugh that you should have such strange notions.\n\nNo.\n\n\u201cI propose a waiting period. Let\u2019s have them wait 20 days for every page \u2014 that would keep them busy for a while,\u201d he said back in 2010.\n\nNo, it\u2019s not a new idea. It\u2019s a re-used idea. C\u2019mon! He\u2019s a Republican. He doesn\u2019t have any new ideas. The \u201cRead the Bills Act\u201d (RTBA) actually dates from 2006, via a nonprofit called Downsize DC. Paul sponsored the bill in the 112th Congress as S.3360 in 2012.\n\nThe House version of the bill, H.R. 1831, was introduced into the 113th Congress by Rep. Kerry Bentivolio (R-MI) on May 6, 2013. Paul\u2019s version of the bill was not enacted by the 112th Congress and was re-introduced in the 113th Congress as S. 1665 where it was not enacted, and is now listed as having \u201cdied in a previous Congress.\u201d\n\nPaul\u2019s bill is/was/is going to be? \u201cTo preserve the constitutional authority of Congress and ensure accountability and transparency in legislation.\u201d It obviously has a not more than reading the bill going on in is 16 pages, and I\u2019m personally all for accountability and transparency and for having Congress read the bills they vote on, preferably before they vote on them.\n\nHere is the problem Paul points to under Sec. 3. Findings:\n\n(9) Under the current rules of the Senate, the Senate has departed from its original practice of a full first and second reading of each bill, and of ensuring that each Senator has a printed or other verbatim copy of each bill before passage thereof, having by rule XIV of the Standing Rules of the Senate limited each reading of a bill to the reading of the title of the bill only, unless the Senate in any case shall otherwise order. (10) Under the current rules of the House of Representatives, the House of Representatives has by rule XVI (8) and rule XVIII (5) embraced its original practice of full first and second readings of each bill, but has regularly departed from this practice by unanimous consent of the House of Representatives, and has dispensed altogether its original practice of a verbatim third reading of each bill before passage, limiting such third reading to the reading of the title only, including the reading of the title only even when Members of the House of Representatives have no printed or other verbatim copy of the bill before passage.\n\nYou can see where this would be a problem. You miss a day or two and you have no idea what you\u2019re voting on when you get back. And these guys miss a lot of days, what with self-aggrandizing press conferences and various other excuses.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing. Paul has some legitimate complaints and he has stuck with this bill and says he is going to continue to stick with it. So he is not just talking. He\u2019s serious about this. He gets due credit for putting his money where his mouth is even if he likes to claim stuff he wrote was actually written by other people.\n\nEven broken clocks are right twice a day.\n\nThe significant difference now is that he is proposing mandating a wait of 1 day per 20 pages, which might have been what he meant back in 2010, but you can never be sure what Paul means \u2013 he isn\u2019t sure himself to judge by recent events. Vaccines, no vaccines, neo-Confederates, no neo-Confederates\u2026\n\nWait a doggone minute! Did I hear him right?\n\nCongress can hardly do anything now. If they have to wait 1 day for every 20 pages, nothing will ever get passed. Like, EVER.\n\nIf, as he says, \u201cthe spending bills are lumped together in something they call a \u2018Cromnibus\u2019 that is thousands of pages long,\u201d then even a thousand page bill will require a delay of 50 days. FIFTY DAYS. That\u2019s almost two months. If the bill is 2,000 pages, we are talking about 100 days, nearly 1/3 of a year.\n\nGiven Congress generally works for less than half a year (For the House, 133 days in 2014, 153 days in 2012, 128 days in 2010, and a whopping 119 days in 2008, down to 104 days in 2006). What are the odds anything at all gets passed?\n\nThey wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything even if they WANTED to do something. Which they don\u2019t.\n\nThis might be why nobody is talking about Paul\u2019s Big Idea. Not to mention nobody actually wants to read the legislation they vote on, particularly Republicans, who can\u2019t even be bothered to attend extra special secret meetings before they whine about not being told what they would have learned at the meeting had they bothered to show up.\n\nYou get the idea. Paul, clearly, doesn\u2019t.\n\nI mean granted, they don\u2019t read the bills they vote on and they should, so you can see that being required to read a bill would have merit. But Paul isn\u2019t requiring them to actually read it; he\u2019s just providing the time in which they could do so \u2013 if they were so inclined.\n\nWhich, to judge from past performance, they\u2019re not.\n\nStrangely, Paul\u2019s bill says nothing about a waiting period. Yes, they have to attest that they either read or had read to them the entire bill:\n\nPrior to voting in favor of final passage of any bill (except a private bill) or resolution, each member of the Senate and each member of the House shall sign an affidavit executed under penalty of perjury as provided in Section 1621, Title 18, United States Code, that the member either (i) was present throughout the entire reading of each such bill or resolution, and listened attentively to such reading in its entirety, or (ii) prior to voting for passage of such bill, read attentively each such bill in its entirety, or (iii) some combination of (i) or (ii), provided however, such affidavit shall not be required of any member of either House if such member votes against the passage of any bill or resolution. Copies of the affidavits shall be maintained by the Clerks of each house of Congress.\n\nBut they don\u2019t have to wait like he said they would have to wait. Did Paul lie to us? How can we take these guys (and they\u2019re mostly guys) at their word? Some of them, Rand Paul, John Boehner, Mitch McConnell, Ted Cruz, Paul Ryan, can\u2019t open their mouths without lying.\n\nAmerica, we are being gypped.\n\nThis is just asking too much out of them, and asking too much of us to believe anything they say, and they only thing most of them are willing to read these days have \u201cKoch\u201d written all over it.\n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019m speaking only for myself when I say that Paul\u2019s solution, as is so often the case, is not a solution. It\u2019s just more lipstick on the proverbial pig.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rand Paul says he wants Congress to read bills before they vote, relying on them to tell us truthfully if they actually read them.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Hrafnkell Haraldsson", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "Rand Paul says he wants Congress to read bills before they vote, relying on them to tell us truthfully if they actually read them.", "title": "Rand Paul's Read the Bills Act Relies on Congress to Tell the Truth", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2015/02/08/rand-pauls-read-bills-act-relies-congress-truth.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/rand-paul-2.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-02-08T08:10:08+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Featured News,Republican Party,114th Congress,america,Congress,government,House of Representatives,Kerry Bentivolio,Rand Paul,Read the Bills Act,Senate,United States Congress,United States House of Representatives,United States Senate,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Republican Party", "published_time": "2015-02-08T08:10:08+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-08T08:10:08+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "114th Congress, america, Congress, government, House of Representatives, Kerry Bentivolio, Rand Paul, Read the Bills Act, Senate, United States Congress, United States House of Representatives, United States Senate"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbc75\"", "article_summary": "The \u201cRead the Bills Act\u201d (RTBA) actually dates from 2006, via a nonprofit called Downsize DC.\nI mean granted, they don\u2019t read the bills they vote on and they should, so you can see that being required to read a bill would have merit.\nSome of them, Rand Paul, John Boehner, Mitch McConnell, Ted Cruz, Paul Ryan, can\u2019t open their mouths without lying.\nLet\u2019s have them wait 20 days for every page \u2014 that would keep them busy for a while,\u201d he said back in 2010.\nCopies of the affidavits shall be maintained by the Clerks of each house of Congress."}
