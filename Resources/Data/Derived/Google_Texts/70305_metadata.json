(Alberto Tomas Halpern)\n\nBorder Patrol spokesman Ramiro Cordero speaks to journalists at the border fence near Sunland Park, New Mexico. (Alberto Tomas Halpern/Newspaper Tree)\n\nChief CBP public affairs officer Ruben Jauregui leads journalists on a tour of the Bridge of the Americas on September 28. (Alberto Tomas Halpern/Newspaper Tree)\n\nWith the U.S. now in its third week of a federal government shutdown, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers at El Paso\u2019s international bridges are working without pay.\n\nCBP is one of the federal government\u2019s largest law enforcement agencies and is responsible for securing the country from terrorists at land, sea and air ports of entry. CBP officers also facilitate the flow of legitimate trade and travel into the U.S.\n\nOnly essential federal employees, including military personnel, federal law enforcement officers, and airport traffic controllers, continue to work through the shutdown. Nonessential federal employees are on temporary unpaid leave, or furlough.\n\nAccording to CBP\u2019s website, employees will be paid for time worked up to September 30. Some CBP employees who work during the shutdown will be paid retroactively once the impasse ends, while others will be paid retroactively only if approved by Congress.\n\nNewspaper Tree attempted to contact CBP to learn more about the shutdown\u2019s impact on international commerce and national security at El Paso\u2019s ports of entry, however, most of CBP\u2019s public information officers have been placed on leave.\n\nPublic information officers are the communications coordinators for governmental organizations. They act as messengers and the public face of an organization. Their jobs are to provide essential information to the public and press.\n\nCBP officers at the Paso del Norte bridge in El Paso directed Newspaper Tree to Doug Mosier, a CBP spokesman. Mosier\u2019s voicemail plays the following message: \u201cDue to the lapse of appropriations and emergency furlough, I\u2019m out of the office.\u201d\n\nBill Brooks, a CBP and Border Patrol spokesman with the Border Patrol\u2019s Big Bend Sector in Marfa, is also on furlough and could not be reached.\n\nRuben Jauregui, CBP\u2019s chief public affairs officer in El Paso, said he couldn\u2019t comment on the shutdown.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t answer any questions to that,\u201d he said. Jauregui said the Department of Homeland Security headquarters in Washington, DC had directed CBP staff to route all media calls to Washington.\n\nJauregui provided the phone number for the U.S. Office of Personnel Management in Washington, DC. He said that office could answer questions about the shutdown\u2019s impact on CBP.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what this number was set up specifically for,\u201d Jauregui said.\n\nThat number also answers with a recorded message, saying that the communications office is open but with reduced staff. No one could be reached and their message box was full.\n\nRamiro Cordero, a spokesman for the El Paso Border Patrol Sector, said he couldn\u2019t answer any questions regarding furloughed Border Patrol officers either.\n\nAsked if anyone could speak to the shutdown\u2019s impact on CBP and Border Patrol officers, Cordero said, \u201cTry and call (the Border Patrol) headquarters in DC.\u201d\n\nNo one answered at the DC press office and Cordero later told Newspaper Tree, \u201cWell, you\u2019re not going to get answers from anybody. You can try, and maybe someone will want to talk, but our orders are to protect our borders and not to answer questions from anyone from public affairs.\u201d\n\nCongressman Beto O\u2019Rourke, who has criticized the government shutdown, said there are very tough consequences to a government shutdown, including the flow of information from government agencies coming to a standstill.\n\n\u201cI think everyone who has dedicated their career to public service is being hurt by it,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said.\n\nThe congressman said he has been in contact with CBP officers in El Paso and the situation is difficult.\n\n\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been good for anyone who works for the federal government,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cCBP officers are working without pay,\u201d he said.\n\nO\u2019Rourke said many CBP officers are concerned over whether or not they can provide for their families during the shutdown. \u201cEspecially the more recently hired officers, who are in many cases living paycheck to paycheck,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said.\n\nHowever, O\u2019Rourke said he didn\u2019t think the shutdown would affect the job performance of CBP officers.\n\n\u201cIt certainly makes a demanding job that much harder. I\u2019d say these are trained professionals who I think take their jobs very seriously,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said.\n\nO\u2019Rourke added that he was hopeful the shutdown would be resolved this week. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing those signs.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, Senate leaders from both parties are getting closer to a deal to end the shutdown. If that happens, legislation would move to the House, where a rift exists between conservative and moderate Republicans.\n\n\u201cYou have two very divergent views on how to finance the government and whether or not you should tie other policy concerns to that, like the Affordable Care Act,\u201d said O\u2019Rourke.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, was signed into law in 2010, with many of its provisions taking effect from 2010 to 2015. The legislation has become a primary issue in whether Congress will provide funding for the federal government.\n\nO\u2019Rourke said House Speaker John Boehner\u2019s biggest challenge in leading the Republican Party through the government shutdown is bridging the gap between moderates and conservatives.\n\n\u201cThe real fight in the House is between House Republicans and House Republicans,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cThat\u2019s where the real drama is, in the House Republican Conference.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "newspaper tree, newspaper tree el paso, el paso news, el paso newspaper", "google-site-verification": "p3kRbu5xMyY7ueLw0lz75DEJu9uSSUfwzwf4sZfKsGY", "twitter": {"domain": "NewspaperTree.com", "description": "Only essential federal employees, including military personnel, federal law enforcement officers, and airport traffic controllers, continue to work through the shutdown.
