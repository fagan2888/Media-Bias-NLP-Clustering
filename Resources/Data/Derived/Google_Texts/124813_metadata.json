Minneapolis introduced the 96-gallon carts last year.\n\nColeman has proposed raising the city\u2019s property tax levy by 2.4 percent, an increase that may translate into much higher taxes for some residents when tax shifts and the actions of the county and school board are factored into the equation.\n\nIf wheeled carts were added next year, St. Paul residents likely would see a 32.6 percent hike in their recycling fees \u2014 an increase of about $17. More than half of that increase would have come from the carts, estimated to cost a total of more than $4 million.\n\nThe balance would have come from a fee increase proposed by Eureka of 12.2 percent, which translates into 14.6 percent when the cost of inflation is added.\n\nEureka\u2019s portion reflected recycling service every other week in the city\u2019s alleys, which combined with the use of the carts was expected to encourage more residents to recycle.\n\nEureka, which has provided recycling services in St. Paul since 2000, had sought a three-year contract extension from St. Paul for service through the end of 2019.\n\nColeman announced last year a new effort to boost St. Paul\u2019s recycling rates. It involved expanding the number of accepted products and making recycling easier for residents to do.\n\nThe city\u2019s program now accepts many plastics it had previously rejected and uses a single-sort system, making it unnecessary for residents to separate newspapers, cans, bottles and other recyclables into different bins.\n\nRoger Meyer, a consultant and neighborhood activist who briefly ran for mayor last year as a Green Party candidate, said he was disappointed by Coleman\u2019s decision to delay the wheeled carts.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a reflection of where his priorities lie, rather than a negotiated deal with Eureka,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was such a big deal in last year\u2019s budget address, and then this year there\u2019s no acknowledgment, like it didn\u2019t exist. It just feels like a pretty substantial departure from a commitment made.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rattled by the projected costs, St.", "og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "Rattled by the projected costs, St.", "title": "No wheeled recycling carts for St. Paul next year", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/no-wheeled-recycling-carts-for-st-paul-next-year/273867021/", "image": {"url": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201083", "width": 1680, "identifier": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201083", "height": 876}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Rattled by the projected costs, St.", "title": "No wheeled recycling carts for St. Paul next year", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/no-wheeled-recycling-carts-for-st-paul-next-year/273867021/", "image": {"src": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201083", "identifier": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201083"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "article": {"tag": "Chris Coleman"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "news_keywords": "St. Paul,recycling,Chris Coleman"}, "article_summary": "Eureka, which has provided recycling services in St. Paul since 2000, had sought a three-year contract extension from St. Paul for service through the end of 2019.\nIf wheeled carts were added next year, St. Paul residents likely would see a 32.6 percent hike in their recycling fees \u2014 an increase of about $17.\nCity officials say that other municipalities get the same or better recycling service for less than what St. Paul residents pay, which is $52.56 this year.\nRattled by the projected costs, St. Paul Mayor Chris Coleman has dropped the plan he announced last year to provide residents with wheeled, lidded carts to make recycling more convenient.\nMaplewood last spring rolled out the carts to its residents, who pay $35.28 annually for recycling services provided by Tennis Sanitation of St. Paul Park, a family business."}
