House Minority Leader Brian DelGrosso knows a little something about deliveries — he is in the pizza business, after all — but even was surprised to find out that his son weighed in 7 pounds 8 ounces despite being 10 days early.

The Loveland Republican reports that his wife, Amber, and his son, Zackary Mark, are both doing great. It’s his fourth child and her first.

Zackary Mark arrived at 7 p.m. Wednesday at Medical Center of the Rockies. And if that weren’t enough, the couple is moving into a new home on Saturday.

DelGrosso expects to be back at the Capitol on Monday, just in time for a lengthy gun hearing on a Republican bill to repeal last year’s magazine limits.
