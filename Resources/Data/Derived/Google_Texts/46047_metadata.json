It's first come, first served.\u201d\n\nStan Brock, an English-born ranch manager in Guyana who later became a co-host of the TV show \u201cWild Kingdom,\u201d founded RAM in 1985 after seeing the suffering of people in the Amazon rain forest because they were isolated from medical care.\n\nRAM's initial mission involved \u201cparachuting into the jungle somewhere,\u201d Brock said. In 1991, however, it provided services to a remote area of Tennessee that had lost its only dentist and soon started arranging clinics in other areas of the United States.\n\n\u201cThere's a tremendous need throughout the United States for the services we provide,\u201d Brock said.\n\nIn 2014, the organization based in Rockford, Tennessee, reportedly served 27,523 patients with more than $9.17 million worth of free medical care.\n\nWhen Manatee resident Glenn Gibellina heard about RAM, he mentioned the opportunity to Philip Brown, executive director of the United Way of Manatee County. Brown referred Gibellina to Conard, who started making arrangements with Brock.\n\nConard expects the RAM clinic in Manatee to provide about $1 million worth of free medical care. RAM clinics tend to see 500 to 1,500 patients each day.\n\nNinety six percent of the patients are adults, Brock said. \u201cIt's predominantly dentistry. They can't go to the ER to get their teeth fixed.\u201d Roughly 100 dental stations are expected to be set up. Dental services will include cleanings, fillings and extractions.\n\nWhile waiting for the dentist, patients are encouraged to see a physician as well. Then they may learn they should also be treated for conditions such as diabetes or hypertension, Brock said.\n\nAn optician crew in a truck will make as many as 500 eyeglasses each day for patients who have vision screenings, Conard said.\n\nConard said he is making arrangements with organizations such as the Salvation Army and Turning Points to make sure the clinic sees \u201cthe neediest of our needy.\u201d\n\nRAM accepts no government funding, Brock said. Its support is largely from \"$5 and $10 checks\u201d from the public.\n\nSo far, Conard told commissioners, the local event has recruited about 400 volunteers and 25 sponsors and partners, Conard said. He is hoping for about 700 to 800 volunteers.", "article_metadata": {"description": "For area residents in need of medical attention, including dental work and vision screenings not covered by the federal Affordable Care Act, help is on the way.", "vf": {"unique_id": "art-88EF4F42-9C27-47F4-90C9-25D2B80440D4-pubSH"}, "og": {"site_name": "HeraldTribune.com", "description": "For area residents in need of medical attention, including dental work and vision screenings not covered by the federal Affordable Care Act, help is on the way.", "title": "Thousands expected at free medical clinic", "url": "http://www.heraldtribune.com/article/20151011/ARTICLE/151019939", "image": "http://G52-SHweb.newscyclecloud.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/bilde?Site=SH&Date=20151011&Category=ARTICLE&ArtNo=151019939&Ref=AR&imageVersion=Teaser", "type": "article"}, "publishdate": 20151011, "fb": {"app_id": 131646103569058}, "tout": {"article": {"id": "art-151019939-pubSH"}}, "keywords": "MANATEE COUNTY (FL),  EEK (AK),  MANOKOTAK (AK),  Social Issue"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8212\"", "article_summary": "Conard expects the RAM clinic in Manatee to provide about $1 million worth of free medical care.\nIn 2014, the organization based in Rockford, Tennessee, reportedly served 27,523 patients with more than $9.17 million worth of free medical care.\nThe clinic is expected to provide about $1 million in free medical careMANATEE COUNTY - For area residents in need of medical attention, including dental work and vision screenings not covered by the federal Affordable Care Act, help is on the way.\n\u201cThere's a tremendous need throughout the United States for the services we provide,\u201d Brock said.\n\u201cNobody is turned away,\u201d Dr. Richard Conard, event chairman, said in a presentation to the Manatee County Commission."}
