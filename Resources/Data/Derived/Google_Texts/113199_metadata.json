But blacks won\u2019t benefit as dramatically unless more states embrace the health care law\u2019s Medicaid expansion, the study, billed as providing the first state-level projections of Obamacare\u2019s impact by race and ethnicity, found.\n\nHealth coverage for all racial and ethnic groups is growing as a result of the Affordable Care Act through the new insurance exchanges and additional public funds for health care. But the study found Obamacare\u2019s expansion of Medicaid is particularly effective at reducing the coverage gap between whites and racial minorities, as minorities are more likely to be uninsured and qualify for the program, which covers lower-income Americans up to 138% of the poverty line.\n\nThat will ultimately help close racial gaps in health-care coverage, researchers found. By 2016, the difference between the white and Latino uninsured rate is projected to fall from 18.1 to 12.7 percentage points, under the current state of Medicaid and Obamacare. The gap between uninsured whites and Native Americans is expected fall from 12.6 to 6.7 percentage points.\n\nBut the gains for black Americans will be less dramatic unless more states embrace the Medicaid expansion, because they disproportionately live in the states that have refused it. Under Supreme Court\u2019s 2012 decision, states can chose to opt out of the Medicaid expansion, which many Republicans argue is an undue burden to states that ultimately must help foot the bill for coverage. To date, 27 states and the District of Columbia have decided to expand Medicaid.\n\nWhile blacks were slightly more likely to sign up for exchange coverage in 2014, over half of them live in states that did not expand Medicaid in 2014, making up 23% of uninsured blacks in the U.S, according to the study. Unless more states expand Medicaid, the coverage gap between black and whites will fall just 1.5 percentage points by 2016.\n\nWithout Obamacare, the uninsured rate for blacks would be 19.6%. That\u2019s projected to fall to 11.3% under the current state of Medicaid, but it would fall even further to 7.2% if all states expanded Medicaid, the study estimates. Obamacare\u2019s impact on the racial health gap comes at a time when other kinds of racial disparities are increasing: The wealth gap between blacks and whites is at its highest level since 1989, according to a new Pew study.\n\nLatinos would also stand to benefit if more states expanded Medicaid, with 38% currently living in non-expansion states. If Texas alone decided to expand Medicaid, Latino health coverage would increase by 11.3% by 2016, according to the study.\n\nBut the uninsured rate for Latinos is still expected to remain relatively high given the prevalence of undocumented immigrants who are excluded by law from the program. Even under a full expansion of Medicaid, the percentage of uninsured Latino will be 16.6% in 2016, according to the study, compared to 19.0% under the current state of Medicaid and 31.2% without Obamacare. Undoucmented residents are also excluded from enrolling in coverage through Obamacare\u2019s exchanges.\n\nOverall, an estimated 4 million Americans are in the Medicaid coverage gap because of states\u2019 opting out of Obamacare\u2019s expansion, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation; the group estimates that 44% are white, 24% are Hispanic, and 26% are black.\n\nThere are signs that more red states will be getting on board with the Medicaid expansion soon. In recent weeks, Republican governors in Tennessee, Utah, and Wyoming have all unveiled expansion plans; GOP governors in Alabama and Florida have also expressed some willingness to back an expansion.\n\nWhile most of the proposed programs would not expand traditional Medicaid, they would target the same population through state-designed pilot programs that have to be approved by the federal government. The goal is \u201cto provide health care coverage to Tennesseans who currently don\u2019t have access to health insurance or have limited options,\u201d Gov. Bill Haslam\u2019s office said in a statement.\n\nSome Republicans have touted the moral urgency of the Medicaid expansion; Ohio Gov. John Kasich cited \u201cthe Good Book\u201d to explain his decision in 2013. But there are growing financial incentives for states to take action as well. The federal government will cover 100% of the costs of the expansion through 2016, when it will scale back support to 90%.\n\nThere\u2019s also growing evidence that the Medicaid expansion can significantly reduce the cost of uncompensated care, which state and local governments also have to shoulder.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "A new study finds Obamacare will reduce the coverage gap between minorities and whites -- but blacks won\u2019t benefit as much unless more states expand Medicaid.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/how-obamacare-reduces-racial-disparities-health-care-study", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "A new study finds Obamacare will reduce the coverage gap between minorities and whites -- but blacks won\u2019t benefit as much unless more states expand Medicaid.", "title": "How Obamacare reduces racial disparities in health care", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/how-obamacare-reduces-racial-disparities-health-care-study", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/460502088.jpg?itok=A3hnw6ZE", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/how-obamacare-reduces-racial-disparities-health-care-study", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/460502088.jpg?itok=XN4vwk25", "title": "How Obamacare reduces racial disparities in health care", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "A new study finds Obamacare will reduce the coverage gap between minorities and whites -- but blacks won\u2019t benefit as much unless more states expand Medicaid."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2014-12-16T16:13:51-05:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "suzykhimm", "title": "How Obamacare reduces racial disparities in health care", "tags": "health", "published": 1, "date": "12/16/2014 16:13:51 EST", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/how-obamacare-reduces-racial-disparities-health-care-study"}, "article": {"author": "http://www.facebook.com/msnbc"}, "abstract": "A new study finds Obamacare will reduce the coverage gap between minorities and whites -- but blacks won\u2019t benefit as much unless more states expand Medicaid.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Health"}, "article_summary": "Health coverage for all racial and ethnic groups is growing as a result of the Affordable Care Act through the new insurance exchanges and additional public funds for health care.\nThere\u2019s also growing evidence that the Medicaid expansion can significantly reduce the cost of uncompensated care, which state and local governments also have to shoulder.\nThe goal is \u201cto provide health care coverage to Tennesseans who currently don\u2019t have access to health insurance or have limited options,\u201d Gov.\nIf Texas alone decided to expand Medicaid, Latino health coverage would increase by 11.3% by 2016, according to the study.\nA new study released Tuesday by the nonpartisan Urban Institute found that Obamacare will reduce the coverage gap between minorities and whites."}
