She ended up not getting one for another year, then undergoing a mastectomy soon after she did because cancer was detected.\n\nAfter her diagnosis with a return of breast cancer in 2014, she left The Post and moved to Costa Rica, where she pursued alternative treatments. She spent her last days at home with family in Springfield.\n\n\u201cI refuse to torture myself with coulda woulda shouldas,\u201d she wrote in an article freelanced for the Post two months ago. \u201cI opted against chemo and radiation after my mastectomy because that was the best choice for me at the time.\u201d\n\n+ \u00d7\n\nDespite the illness, she kept busy after leaving West Palm Beach, gaining certification as a life coach.\n\n\u201cI help breast cancer survivors find a new normal for their lives,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI also help women change the limiting beliefs that prevent them from pursuing their dreams and having the healthy relationships they deserve.\u201d\n\nPost Editorial Page Editor Rick Christie spoke Wednesday of Swan\u2019s personal strength. \u201cShe was a strong woman. I have three daughters. She\u2019s the kind of woman I want my daughters to look up to,\u201d he said.\n\n+ Tim Stepien Rhonda Swan Tim Stepien \u00d7\n\nShe was an \u201cunabashed and unapologetic liberal,\u201d to the point where she would chastise even other liberals who waffled on an issue, he recalled.\n\n\u201cShe was tough,\u201d Randy Schultz, her boss before Christie, agreed. \u201cShe would bone up so well, especially on the subject of health care \u2026 Definitely one of the memorable moments during our editorial board meetings was when the governor came down,\u201d said Schultz, a former Post editorial page editor.\n\nIt was October or November of 2011, Obamacare had been enacted, though it faced a Supreme Court challenge. Gov. Rick Scott, adamant in opposition to the Affordable Care Act, told the editorial board, \u201c\u2018I don\u2019t think it will ever be the law of the land,\u2019\u201d Schultz said.\n\n+ Rhonda Swan (right) with her daughter, Amira Johnson. \u00d7\n\n\u201cRhonda looked at him and said: \u2018Right now it is the law of the land.\u2019 He was speechless.\u201d\n\nSwan leaves three adult children, Amira, Seneca and Stephon; and three grandchildren.\n\nAn author and award-winning journalist, she worked as an editorial writer, editor and reporter for the Post from 2005 to 2014. Prior to that she served as deputy city editor for The News Journal in Wilmington, Del.; and Family/Community Team editor at The Daily Press, in Williamsburg, Va.\n\nRelated See Rhonda Swan's past columns in The Post\n\nSwan earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in journalism with a minor in psychology from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.\n\nHer book, \u201cDancing to the Rhythm of My Soul: A Sister\u2019s Guide for Transforming Madness into Gladness,\u201d was a memoir based on Swan\u2019s spiritual journey that also served as a self-help guide. Swan wrote two novels, \u201cI Saw Your Profile\u201d and \u201cExposed: The Consequences of Truth.\u201d She also published a volume of poetry, \u201cSpeaking My Mind \u2026 in Poetic Verse.\u201d\n\n\u201cRhonda was a beautiful writer and highly respected journalist, but her courage was her greatest gift,\u201d said Tim Burke, publisher of The Post. \u201cShe decided to live her final years on her terms and cherish life\u2019s special moments, grateful \u2018for every sunrise my eyes behold.\u2019\u201d\n\nThat last phrase came from the article she wrote in the Post in October. Here are the final paragraphs from that piece, sharing the perspective of her final days:\n\n\u201cThis year got off to a scary start but I\u2019ve made every important occasion I feared I\u2019d miss.\n\n\u201cI cheered from the stands as my daughter graduated college. I witnessed my granddaughter\u2019s birth, a life-affirming experience that brought me to tears. I celebrated my grandson\u2019s fourth birthday and my granddaughter\u2019s first. Fred (her boyfriend) and I will take our first cruise together later this month.\n\n\u201cThese are the moments that make life worth living. Not how much money you earn, the kind of car you drive or the size of the house you live in.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m grateful for every sunrise my eyes behold, every breath I\u2019m privileged to take and every laugh I get to share with the people I love.\n\n\u201cEvery day is a reason to celebrate. Every day is a new opportunity to create the life we truly want.\u201d\n\nA funeral is scheduled for Jan. 2, 11 a.m., at the Spring of Hope Church, 35 Alden St., Springfield, Mass.
