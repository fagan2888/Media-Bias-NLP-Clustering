Nobody. His timeless voice has wrapped itself around decades of memorable hits, including \u201cChances Are,\u201d \u201cWonderful Wonderful,\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s Not for Me to Say,\u201d \u201cThe Twelfth of Never\u201d and \u201cMisty.\u201d\n\nTo celebrate his upcoming 80th birthday, Columbia Records is releasing a four-CD box set of Mr. Mathis\u2019s best-loved songs titled \u201cThe Singles.\u201d In advance of that, the intensely private singer discussed finding joy in music, who he listens to and his favorite songs of all time.\n\nQuestion: Do you often look back on your career?\n\nAnswer: I look at the good, the bad and sometimes the ugly. [laughs] I started so young, and I have been recording since I was about 19. A lot of the stuff we did was kind of hit and miss. A few years later I got a handle on it.\n\nQ: When you listened to the songs on the box set, was there anything that surprised you?\n\nA: I was kind of surprised at some of the songs. They are really charming. When I listen to it, I kind of remember certain aspects of what was going on musically at the time in the country.\n\nQ: How do you choose the songs you sing?\n\nA: In the beginning a lot of the songs were given to me because the record company thought that was the way to go. They rarely made a mistake. They gave me the best musicians to work with. Then they told me I could choose what I wanted. I started to record albums. I had a lot of success with my albums because of the people I recorded with: Percy Faith and Glenn Arthur and Ray Conniff. Don Costa.\n\nQ: Who were your favorite people to collaborate with?\n\nA: I loved Percy Faith because I think he he was the most inventive of all with his sound. Then, later on in life, I met the fabulous Henry Mancini. He and I became pals, and we worked together for 20 years almost. I miss him greatly. I am a product of all these wonderful arrangers that I met along the way and worked with.\n\nQ: Were you ever interested in writing your own songs?\n\nA: [laughs] I remember vividly flying back from South America, and I think they gave us a couple drinks. [laughs] I decided I was going to write a song. I had never written before and [have] never written since. [laughs] It was one of those things where you say, \u201cWell, I think I can do that. That doesn\u2019t seem like it is so difficult.\u201d But of course there is so much to songwriting. I\u2019ve been surrounded by so many gifted people that my efforts in songwriting were not needed.\n\nQ: Of all the songs you have sung, do you have a favorite?\n\nA: The song that I keep telling people is my favorite is \u201cMisty,\u201d and there is a reason: When I was about 12 years old, my dad used to take me to a jazz club called The Blackhawk in San Francisco. Of all the great jazz musicians I saw, the one that stood out the most was Erroll Garner. He wrote several songs, but the one that sticks in my mind was \u201cMisty.\u201d To this day that is my favorite moment \u2014 when I get to sing \u201cMisty\u201d in my live performance. It gives my performance a bit of sophistication.\n\nQ: How is the voice these days?\n\nA: I was very fortunate at the very beginning of my career that my dad instigated \u2026 that I should find a voice teacher. I said, \u201cWhat for?\u201d I didn\u2019t have any idea what the voice teacher was going to do. Thank God my dad did. I studied with a voice teacher until I was 19.\n\nThat is the thing that has kept me in good shape over the years. I haven\u2019t had too much trouble other than once in a while laryngitis from screaming too loud at football games. I\u2019ve very lucky that I\u2019ve maintained most of my voice.\n\nQ: Some singers draw from pain as inspiration. You seem to find inspiration in joy.\n\nA: When I wake up in the morning, the only thing that pops into my head is that I\u2019m going to have to sing. I\u2019m so grateful that I like the sound that comes out. I\u2019ve been very lucky in that respect. I still enjoy the physical aspect of finding songs that I\u2019m not familiar with and finding a way to introduce them to the public.\n\nQ: What is next for you musically?\n\nA: The next thing I\u2019m doing is a series of songs which are very contemporary. It\u2019s kind of a difficult task for me because most of the people who write songs recently write and perform their own songs. Some of them are great songwriters and terrible singers. [laughs] You have to try to find something that you can perform. I have about four or five. We\u2019re gonna need maybe three or four more before we start recording.\n\nQ: How will you be spending your upcoming 80th birthday?\n\nA: You got anything in mind? [laughs] I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m just happy to be doing what I\u2019m doing. And to be relatively healthy. I have no idea what I\u2019m gonna do, and that is kind of the fun part of it. Most of the things I\u2019ve done have been instigated by the people I\u2019ve met along the way.\n\nQ: Do you ever see a time in which you\u2019ll retire?\n\nA: Not yet. It may happen, but I hope not. I kind of enjoy what I\u2019m doing. I just played golf yesterday with a buddy, and I played so badly that I don\u2019t think I can do anything really well except sing.\n\n\u201cThe Singles\u201d box set will be out Sept. 25.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Nobody can sing like Johnny Mathis.His timeless voice has wrapped itself around decades of memorable hits, including \"Chances Are,\" \"Wonderful Wonderful,\" \"It's Not for Me to Say,\" \"The Twelfth of Never\" and \"Misty.\" To celebrate his upcoming 80th birthday, Columbia Records is releasing a four-CD box set of Mr. Mathis's best-loved songs titled \"The Singles.\"", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Nobody can sing like Johnny Mathis.His timeless voice has wrapped itself around decades of memorable hits, including \u201cChances Are,\u201d \u201cWonderful Wonderful,\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s Not for Me to Say,\u201d \u201cThe Twelfth of Never\u201d and \u201cMisty.\u201d To celebrate his upcoming 80th birthday, Columbia Records is releasing a four-CD box set of Mr. Mathis\u2019s best-loved songs titled \u201cThe Singles.\u201d", "title": "Johnny Mathis interview: New box set for his 80th birthday", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/7/johnny-mathis-interview/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/07/Mathis_2BlkShirt.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/07/Mathis_2BlkShirt.jpg", "description": "Nobody can sing like Johnny Mathis.His timeless voice has wrapped itself around decades of memorable hits, including \"Chances Are,\" \"Wonderful Wonderful,\" \"It's Not for Me to Say,\" \"The Twelfth of Nev", "card": "summary", "title": "Johnny Mathis interview: New box set for his 80th birthday"}, "Author": "Keith Valcourt \u2014 Special to The Washington Times", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Human Interest, Entertainment Culture"}, "article_summary": "I\u2019m just happy to be doing what I\u2019m doing.\nA: When I wake up in the morning, the only thing that pops into my head is that I\u2019m going to have to sing.\nQ: When you listened to the songs on the box set, was there anything that surprised you?\nA: The next thing I\u2019m doing is a series of songs which are very contemporary.\nI kind of enjoy what I\u2019m doing."}
