When it comes to language development alone, higher-income parents spend an average of 30 more minutes each day reading to their kids face-to-face than lower-income parents. By the time these kids turn 5, they\u2019ll have heard 30 million fewer words, The Atlantic reported. These deficits appear not only in language development but in math as well, among other aspects of education; and they also appear in the child\u2019s brain.\n\n\u201cPrevious research has shown that growing up in poverty can shape the wiring and even physical dimensions of a young child\u2019s brain, with negative effects on language, learning, and attention,\u201d said Dr. Jacquelyn Gamino, director of the Center for BrainHealth\u2019s Adolescent Reasoning Initiative, in a press release. In a new study, Gamino and her team have found that a targeted intervention with cognitive training can improve performance in poor middle school kids. \u201cWhat this work shows is that there is hope for students in poverty to catch up with their peers not living in poverty.\u201d\n\nAlthough poor children entering pre-k and kindergarten already score 60 percent lower in cognitive tests than kids with richer parents, the researchers in the current study said that \u201cextensive frontal lobe development and pruning occurs during adolescence,\u201d making middle school a good point to intervene with brain training.\n\nSo, they recruited 913 7th and 8th grade students from various socioeconomic backgrounds and split them up so that 556 students underwent cognitive training and 357 served as controls. The training group underwent both pre- and post-training assessments in which they were asked to text and not only summarize it but develop personal inferences \u201cto transform ideas into novel, generalized statements\u201d the release said, as well as recall important facts. They then took part in 10 training sessions, each lasting 45 minutes, over the course of a month.\n\nGamino\u2019s team found that the training improved poorer students\u2019 scores by about 25 percent on tests measuring their ability to produce abstract ideas from the information. They also showed an 18 percent increase in their ability to memorize facts. \u201cThe ability to use inference to abstract meaning from incoming information\u2026 is a skill crucial to future life success, and applies to both academic and informal learning activities, such as reading a school assignment, listening and taking notes from a lecture, watching a movie or television program, or have a conversation with a friend,\u201d Gamino said.\n\nSource: Gamino J, Motes M, Riddle R, Lyon G, Spence J, Chapman S.
