March 31 is the last day to sign up for individual coverage this year.\n\nMore than 1 million people have signed up for health insurance through the Covered California exchange as of mid-March.\n\nBarcellos said knowledge about the Affordable Care Act has likely increased since the fall, but she wasn't optimistic about people gaining a better understanding of how health insurance works.\n\n\"There's less reason to think that people would now understand what a deductible is, or would understand different types of health insurance plans,\" she said.\n\nBarcellos said the lack of familiarity can be a handicap for consumers trying to sort through numerous health plans at different prices.\n\nMaria Reyes, a state-certified enrollment counselor at Eisner Pediatric & Family Medical Center in Los Angeles, said that most people she encounters don't know much about the mechanics of health coverage.\n\nMonday's report recommends that when enrollment reopens in November, government exchanges should simplify how they display health plan information. For instance, the website could list only the cheapest plan for different metal tiers, such as bronze, silver and gold, instead of several plans for each level.\n\nUnlike the federal exchange, Covered California tried to make for easier comparison shopping in its first year by standardizing benefits across health plans.\n\nState officials, insurers and medical providers expect a flurry of consumer questions once people start using their insurance for the first time in the months ahead.\n\nALSO:\n\nCovered California begins ad blitz in final weeks\n\nState exchange pulls error-ridden physician directory--again\n\nCalifornia says 14,500 must redo Obamacare applications after glitch\n\nTwitter: @skarlamangla\n\nsoumya.karlamangla@latimes.com", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Health insurance basics stump many Obamacare shoppers, survey finds", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "Amid the final frenzy for Obamacare enrollment, a new survey shows that many consumers may be ill-equipped to shop for health insurance.", "title": "Health insurance basics stump many Obamacare shoppers, survey finds", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-mo-aca-knowledge-report-20140321-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-532d1b43/turbine/la-fi-mo-aca-knowledge-report-20140321", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp13.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "obamacare, affordable care act, covered california, USC", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/79694775", "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2014-03-24", "Description": "A new survey shows that many consumers may be ill-equipped to shop for health insurance.", "y_key": "cee2fe4077f8d050", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "obamacare, affordable care act, covered california, USC"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd81bc\"", "article_summary": "Amid the final frenzy for Obamacare enrollment, a new survey shows that many consumers may be ill-equipped to shop for health insurance.\nMore than 1 million people have signed up for health insurance through the Covered California exchange as of mid-March.\n\"There's less reason to think that people would now understand what a deductible is, or would understand different types of health insurance plans,\" she said.\nThe healthcare law requires that most Americans have medical insurance in 2014 or pay a penalty.\nBarcellos said the lack of familiarity can be a handicap for consumers trying to sort through numerous health plans at different prices."}
