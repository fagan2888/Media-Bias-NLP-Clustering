(AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster)\n\nJ. David Cox Sr. can be a jolly fellow, but he might be confusing budget time with the Christmas season.\n\nThe American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) leader reacted to President Obama\u2019s call for a 1.6 percent federal employees\u2019 pay raise as if Santa left stones in their stockings.\n\n\u201cAFGE is calling on lawmakers to approve a 5.3% pay raise in 2017, which reflects the 1.6% national increase employees should receive plus a partial catch-up for the national and local pay adjustments denied for the past four years,\u201d said the union president\u2019s statement.\n\nNo matter how good his point might be, 5.3 percent is only a little bit more realistic than expecting peace on Earth and goodwill to all. Congress won\u2019t grant that increase, despite federal workforce sacrifices in recent years.\n\n\u201cFor six consecutive years, federal employees received no locality increases to their pay, and for three of those years they received no pay raise at all,\u201d said Cox after The Washington Post reported the pay plan. The freeze was on basic pay rates. \u201cSince 2010, the inflation-adjusted value of federal wages and salaries has fallen by 6.5%, leaving all federal employees with a lower standard of living than they had at the start of the decade.\u201d\n\nThe planned pay hike is included in the budget proposal the administration will release Tuesday. Complaining Obama \u201cagain set the bar far too low,\u201d Cox said the 1.6 percent hike continues \u201ca regrettable record of denying federal employees even the most basic cost-of-living adjustments.\u201d\n\nAFGE is organizing a Capitol Hill \u201crally for a fair pay raise\u201d on budget day with sympathetic members of Congress and national labor leaders.\n\nNational Treasury Employees Union President Tony Reardon also complained about a raise that \u201cdoes little to overcome several years of pay freezes and below-market increases,\u201d but he did praise Obama\u2019s call for six weeks of paid parental leave for federal workers.\n\nAlthough Congress isn\u2019t going to give federal workers the raise they want, they were on the minds of legislators Thursday.\n\nBeth Cobert appeared before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, which is considering her appointment as director of the Office of Personnel Management. She has been serving as the acting director since July, when the previous boss, Katherine Archuleta, left under heavy criticism surrounding the cyber-theft of personal information belonging to 22 million federal employees and others.\n\nCommittee Chairman Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) had kind words for Cobert, but he clearly has not been pleased with OPM\u2019s leadership related to the breach. \u201cCongress should not have to tell agency heads that they are responsible for protecting Americans\u2019 most sensitive data. That responsibility should be obvious,\u201d he said. \u201cUnfortunately, that has not been the case.\u201d\n\nHe also questioned her about a subpoena for records related to how the cyber-theft was discovered. House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) issued the subpoena Tuesday.\n\n\u201cOPM, under Ms. Cobert\u2019s leadership, is not cooperating with the Committee\u2019s investigation\u2026\u201d Chaffetz said in a statement. \u201cThe documents we\u2019ve repeatedly requested be provided to this Committee are essential to fulfilling that promise. Despite assurances of cooperation, I\u2019m disappointed Ms. Cobert is not working in good faith with the Committee.\u201d\n\nCobert said OPM has been \u201cworking very actively\u201d to be responsive to the House demand for documents. An OPM statement said \u201cOPM has made every effort to work in good faith to respond to multiple congressional oversight requests\u201d and pointed to the \u201ctens of thousands of documents and internal reports\u201d and the \u201cthousands of staff-hours\u201d used in replying to congressional requests.\n\nJohnson also pressed Cobert on a letter sent to her Tuesday by Sen. David Vitter (R-La.). In it, he issued a veiled threat to hold up her nomination, saying he would be happy to see \u201cthe nomination move forward\u201d if OPM provides responses to questions posed to her predecessors on \u201ca number of questions related to the special health care exemption given to Members of Congress and congressional staff under\u201d the Affordable Care Act. The questions date from 2013.\n\nA veiled threat is no less real. Vitter held up the nomination of retired Navy Rear Adm. Earl L. Gay to be OPM deputy director last year for the same reason. Gay\u2019s nomination was eventually withdrawn, because of politics, not qualifications.\n\nVitter complained about OPM\u2019s involvement with regulations that allowed Congress to declare itself a \u201csmall business\u201d for purposes of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nJohnson asked Cobert \u201cwhat kind of mental gymnastics was required of OPM to basically define Congress as a small employer.\u201d She said she\u2019d have to get back to the committee because those issues were considered before her time at OPM.\n\nBut in the politics of Capitol Hill, that might not matter.\n\nJohnson said he sympathizes with Vitter\u2019s points and the frustration over \u201cthe lack of response from OPM.\u201d Reminding Cobert of Gay\u2019s ill-fated nomination, Johnson said, ominously, \u201cthis will be a serious issue.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\n[What Obama plans for federal pay raises in 2017]\n\n[Acting U.S. personnel chief takes over agency with big problems]\n\n[Obama wants to take \u2018acting\u2019 off Beth Cobert\u2019s title as OPM director]\n\n[Affordable Care Act dispute could hang up confirmation of new federal personnel chief]", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama's plan for a federal pay raise is criticized as too low.
