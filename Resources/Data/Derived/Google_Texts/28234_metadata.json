They were looking for Givens' brother Matthew Givens, who was a suspect in a burglary. Slager went to the front door and the other officer went to the rear of the house.\n\nHere is the report of the investigation into Slager based on a complaint from Givens:\n\nThe Associated Press reports that North Charleston police spokesman Spencer Pryor said the department plans to review the Givens case.\n\nThe AP, which first reported the story, adds:\n\n\n\n\"The incident report filed by Slager and the other officer, Maurice Huggins, provides a very different version of events. In the report, obtained by The AP through a public-records request, Slager wrote that he could not see one of Givens' hands and feared he might be holding a weapon. He wrote that he observed sweat on Givens' shirt, which he perceived as evidence that he could have run from Brown's home, and then ordered him to exit several times. \"Givens didn't comply; Slager said he entered the home to prevent him from fleeing and was then forced to use his stun gun when Givens struggled with him. The officers' report describes the Givens brothers as looking 'just alike.' \"\n\n\n\nAs the notes show, Givens is 6 feet 3 inches tall. His brother, the suspect, is 5 feet 5 inches tall.\n\nSlager was charged this week with murder for shooting and killing Walter Scott, 50, last weekend after a traffic stop. Bystander video from the scene shows Scott was running away from the officer when he was shot.\n\nGivens shook his head when the AP asked him about Slager being charged with murder in the death of Walter Scott.\n\n\"It could have been prevented,\" he said of Scott's death. \"If they had just listened to me and investigated what happened that night, this man might be alive today.\"\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "News", "description": "Editor&#039;s note on April 24: An image from the video taken by a witness has been removed from this post because the copyright holder has rescinded the", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://wnpr.org/post/officer-sc-shooting-previously-accused-using-excessive-force", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wnpr/files/201502/wnpr-default-image.png", "type": "article", "description": "Editor&#039;s note on April 24: An image from the video taken by a witness has been removed from this post because the copyright holder has rescinded the", "title": "Officer In S.C.
