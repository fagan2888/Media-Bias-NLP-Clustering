The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against the administration on Tuesday, setting up a possible appeal to the high court. The case was brought by 26 states with Republican governors who say Obama's executive action, signed in November, places an undue burden on the states.Morris, appearing Tuesday on \"Newsmax Prime,\" praised then-Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott for filing the suit before a conservative Texas federal judge. Abbott is now Texas governor.Even the three-judge panel at the Fifth Circuit represented a conservative court, and the Supreme Court is currently 5-4 conservative.\"It bypasses all the liberal circuits,\" Morris said. \"So Obama's amnesty is in serious trouble. And of course it should be. It's totally illegal.\"But the ruling isn't likely to see deportations begin immediately, Morris added.\"They'll probably say, we're just going to wait and see how this litigation all unfolds,\" he said. \"Had it been the other way and they ordered them to start deportations, that would be a different story. But it's hard to tell a federal agency to go ahead and do something when it is otherwise inclined not to.\"Morris said he expects the Supreme Court to rule against Obama in the amnesty case, and also in the Obamacare case that challenges the payment of subsidies to people enrolled in the federal exchange.\"I think a year from now we're going to be saying Barack Obama's agenda has been obliterated by the Supreme Court because it was illegal all along,\" Morris said.Morris also talked to \"Newsmax Prime\" and \"The Steve Malzberg Show\" about the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which he said is not a trade agreement at all.\"It's using the word free trade because it's a good slogan to get Republican support,\" he said, while it really just empowers litigants and plaintiffs throughout the world to sue the U.S. government and state and local governments to eliminate any restrictions placed by those entities on imports.\"Does the Department of Agriculture consider that hoof and mouth disease is prevalent in Chile and we shouldn't be able to get their beef? Under this they could sue and overturn that,\" Morris said.The House may stop the bill, he said, because \"40 brave Republican conservatives\" have protested immigration and other bills and may do so again with TPP.Turning to the race for the White House, Morris said Hillary Clinton might actually see declining poll numbers once she has to debate Democratic opponents. Currently, she is seen as being attacked by Rep. Trey Gowdy on Benghazi and her private emails, but once Democratic voters see the same criticisms from fellow Democrats, they'll be more inclined to listen.\"A lot of them are going to say, 'Well, now I feel comfortable in voting against Hillary,' and that will create a reinforcing cycle of Democrats saying, 'See, she's slipping in the polls, we'd better turn to somebody else because we'll lose if we nominate her.'\"No one in the Obama administration but Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro has publicly defended Clinton in her email controversy, Morris told Malzberg.\"There's total silence and it's interesting, his statement, because he's the only one saying a peep, and what's he, the 14th ranking member of the cabinet?\" Morris said. \"It shows that Obama has not invested heavily in Hillary. He's going to let her sink or swim on her own.\"", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Dick Morris, Obama, executive, amnesty, illegal, immigrants, Supreme Court", "pubdate": "2015-05-26T20:15:30", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "President Barack Obama will eventually lose at the Supreme Court on his attempt to stop deportations of some illegal immigrants, political analyst Dick Morris tells Newsmax TV.", "title": "Dick Morris: Obama Will Lose on Immigration at Supreme Court", "url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/Dick-Morris-Obama-executive-amnesty/2015/05/26/id/646873/", "type": "article", "image": "http://www.newsmax.com/App_Themes/Newsmax/images/facebook/newsmaxFBLogo.gif", "page_id": 85452072376}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/Dick-Morris-Obama-executive-amnesty/2015/05/26/id/646873/", "title": "Dick Morris: Obama Will Lose on Immigration at Supreme Court", "description": "President Barack Obama will eventually lose at the Supreme Court on his attempt to stop deportations of some illegal immigrants, political analyst Dick Morris tells Newsmax TV.", "site": "Newsmax"}, "fb": {"admins": 100002083767056, "app_id": 323020797885219}, "msvalidate.01": "FAF1322EC761685A5DD9344A1C19E82A", "epoch": 1432671330, "google-site-verification": "Jt2HUKgzJJw9VwIQJv31ETytuvNNm5ypTWN6j0nYvHM", "keywords": "Dick Morris, Obama, executive, amnesty, illegal, immigrants, Supreme Court", "article": {"section": "Newsfront", "published_time": "2015-05-26T20:15:30"}, "original-source": "http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/Dick-Morris-Obama-executive-amnesty/2015/05/26/id/646873/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "description": "President Barack Obama will eventually lose at the Supreme Court on his attempt to stop deportations of some illegal immigrants, political analyst Dick Morris tells Newsmax TV."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd136e\"", "article_summary": "Abbott is now Texas governor.Even the three-judge panel at the Fifth Circuit represented a conservative court, and the Supreme Court is currently 5-4 conservative.\nGet Newsmax TV on your cable system \u2014Click Here NowPresident Barack Obama will eventually lose at the Supreme Court on his attempt to stop deportations of some illegal immigrants, political analyst Dick Morris tells Newsmax TV.\nThe Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against the administration on Tuesday, setting up a possible appeal to the high court.\n\"Morris said he expects the Supreme Court to rule against Obama in the amnesty case, and also in the Obamacare case that challenges the payment of subsidies to people enrolled in the federal exchange.\nNote: Watch Newsmax TV on DirecTV Ch."}
