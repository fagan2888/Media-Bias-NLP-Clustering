The Thursday an\u00adnounce\u00adment\u2014aimed at in\u00adcreas\u00ading ac\u00adcess to treat\u00adment\u2014fo\u00adcuses on a reg\u00adu\u00adla\u00adtion lim\u00adit\u00ading the num\u00adber of pre\u00adscrip\u00adtions doc\u00adtors can write for bupren\u00adorphine, a medi\u00adcine used to com\u00adbat paink\u00adiller and heroin de\u00adpend\u00adence.\n\nThe cur\u00adrent rule: Phys\u00adi\u00adcians cer\u00adti\u00adfied to pre\u00adscribe the med\u00adic\u00ada\u00adtion, at first, can only do so for 30 pa\u00adtients. After a year, they can be al\u00adlowed to write pre\u00adscrip\u00adtions for up to 100 pa\u00adtients. The de\u00adpart\u00adment an\u00adnounced this would change, but fell short of say\u00ading ex\u00adactly what the new reg\u00adu\u00adla\u00adtion would be.\n\n\u201cThis epi\u00addem\u00adic is mul\u00adti\u00adfa\u00adceted, and we need to re\u00adspond with the best solu\u00adtions that medi\u00adcine and be\u00adha\u00advi\u00ador\u00adal ther\u00adapy can provide to\u00adgeth\u00ader,\u201d HHS Sec\u00adret\u00adary Sylvia Bur\u00adwell said Thursday at a two-day, 50-state meet\u00ading aimed at find\u00ading solu\u00adtions to the rise in opioid use. \u201cSo we need to in\u00adcrease the use of bupren\u00adorphine, which can help us treat opioid use dis\u00adorder when com\u00adbined with psy\u00adcho-so\u00adcial sup\u00adport.\u201d\n\nAd\u00addi\u00adtion\u00adally, the de\u00adpart\u00adment\u2019s Of\u00adfice of Rur\u00adal Health Policy will dole out about $1.8 mil\u00adlion in grants to com\u00admunity part\u00adners in 13 states. This comes on the heels of a White House an\u00adnounce\u00adment last week that the ad\u00admin\u00adis\u00adtra\u00adtion is us\u00ading $500 mil\u00adlion au\u00adthor\u00adized by the Af\u00adford\u00adable Care Act in part to give com\u00admunity health cen\u00adters more re\u00adsources to treat pa\u00adtients with al\u00adco\u00adhol and drug ad\u00addic\u00adtion.\n\nThat\u2019s be\u00adcause pre\u00adscrip\u00adtion drugs and their cheap\u00ader al\u00adtern\u00adat\u00adive\u2014heroin\u2014have hit com\u00admunit\u00adies hard in re\u00adcent years. From 2002 to 2013, the num\u00adber of heroin-re\u00adlated deaths nearly quad\u00adrupled to 8,200, ac\u00adcord\u00ading to the Cen\u00adters for Dis\u00adease Con\u00adtrol and Pre\u00adven\u00adtion. And from 1999 to 2013, paink\u00adiller-re\u00adlated deaths nearly quad\u00adrupled to 16,000, the CDC re\u00adports.\n\nCap\u00adit\u00adol Hill, the White House, and pres\u00adid\u00aden\u00adtial can\u00addid\u00adates are tak\u00ading no\u00adtice. In May, Sens. Rand Paul and Ed\u00adward Mar\u00adkey in\u00adtro\u00adduced a bill that would, like the ad\u00admin\u00adis\u00adtra\u00adtion\u2019s Thursday an\u00adnounce\u00adment, in\u00adcrease ac\u00adcess to bupren\u00adorphine. In Au\u00adgust, the ad\u00admin\u00adis\u00adtra\u00adtion an\u00adnounced it would fun\u00adnel $5 mil\u00adlion in\u00adto re\u00addu\u00adcing the traf\u00adfick\u00ading, dis\u00adtri\u00adbu\u00adtion, and use of heroin. This month, Demo\u00adcrat\u00adic front-run\u00adner Hil\u00adlary Clin\u00adton un\u00adveiled a $10 bil\u00adlion plan to treat drug and al\u00adco\u00adhol ad\u00addic\u00adtion and fo\u00adcus on treat\u00adment rather than jail time.\n\nDur\u00ading Bur\u00adwell\u2019s an\u00adnounce\u00adment to ex\u00adpand ac\u00adcess to med\u00adic\u00ada\u00adtion-as\u00adsisted treat\u00adment, she in\u00advoked the story of a young wo\u00adman from Den\u00adver, named Blair Hub\u00adbard. Hub\u00adbard was a \u201cgood kid,\u201d Bur\u00adwell said, who be\u00adcame ad\u00addicted to paink\u00adillers after her wis\u00addom teeth were re\u00admoved and then turned to heroin. After a near death ex\u00adper\u00adi\u00adence, Hub\u00adbard got help\u2014and it was a com\u00adbin\u00ada\u00adtion of med\u00adic\u00ada\u00adtion and ther\u00adapy that helped kick-start her sobri\u00adety.\n\n\u201cThe solu\u00adtion to this prob\u00adlem is not go\u00ading to be easy, but Blair\u2019s fight wasn\u2019t easy either,\u201d Bur\u00adwell said. \u201cFor her and for all of our neigh\u00adbors up against opioid ab\u00aduse, we have to fight just as hard. Good in\u00adten\u00adtions are not enough.
