PEORIA — An East Bluff man already facing drug charges in Peoria County Circuit Court appeared Friday in federal court on similar charges.

Michael A. Hill, 57, of 803 E. Republic St., was ordered to be held in the custody of the U.S. marshals pending review by a federal grand jury on charges of possession of heroin with intent to deliver.

On Sept. 16, Hill and Margaret Mitchell, 53, also of the East Republic address, were stopped at 9:15 p.m. in the 1800 block of North North Street. Jessie Mitchell, 26, also of the Republic address, was arrested minutes later at the house.

According to complaint filed in U.S. District Court this week, Hill allegedly told police that he was a “small-time” heroin dealer who made about $600 a week by selling drugs.

Jessie Mitchell and Margaret Mitchell face similar charges in Peoria County Circuit Court. Neither of them appear to be charged in federal court as a result of the incident.
