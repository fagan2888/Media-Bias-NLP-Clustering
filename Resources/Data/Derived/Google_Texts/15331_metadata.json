(AP) - Somer\u2019s Garden marks it first anniversary April 23.\n\nThe first public food forest garden in Northeast Florida is a living memorial to 7-year-old Somer Thompson who was abducted, assaulted and murdered on Oct. 19, 2009, by Jarred Harrell, who had lured her inside the home that once stood at the site. Harrell, now 30, is serving life in prison.\n\nSomer\u2019s mother, Diena Thompson, obtained the foreclosed home at 1152 Gano Ave. and arranged to have it burned down as a training exercise for firefighters. But she also wanted to honor her daughter\u2019s memory. Thompson partnered with nonprofit Bringing Food Forests to Northeast Florida to transform the site into a self-sustaining community garden of organic vegetables, fruits, herbs and flowers.\n\nThe community garden has blossomed since then - growing into a place of healing as well as fresh produce including cabbage, strawberries, and bush beans - all free for the picking 24/7. Birds chirp and sing sweetly from the limbs of shade trees, and benches offer a place to rest and think between the vegetable plots.\n\nNow, a grassroots effort is under way to share the story of Somer\u2019s Garden with the nation.\n\nMichelle Obama is touring gardens nationwide modeled after her vegetable plot at the White House, which she planted in 2009 to promote healthy eating. The idea took root. It sprouted, \u201cLet\u2019s Move,\u201d a childhood obesity prevention initiative she launched in 2010. Now, she is spending her final year as first lady traveling the country visiting school and community gardens.\n\nSomer\u2019s Garden will be one of Obama\u2019s stops if an ongoing effort succeeds.\n\nBringing Food Forests to Northeast Florida in partnership with the nonprofit Somer Sunshine Foundation, which was established by Thompson to help child victims and their families, Sundance Fresh Farm based in St. Johns County, and the nonprofit Eastside Environmental Coalition in Jacksonville, initiated an online petition along with a social media campaign to persuade Obama to visit the garden on its first anniversary.\n\nThompson couldn\u2019t be reached for comment.\n\nPosted on the White House website, the petition was launched March 11.\n\n\u201cThe petition drive is two-fold. It\u2019s to show her that the community wants this, the community supports us and they want her \u201cLet\u2019s Move\u201d initiative to visit Somer\u2019s Garden,\u201d said Jolinda Kohl, co-founder of Bringing Food Forests to Northeast Florida.\n\nThe other aspect is to get the community involved in bringing Obama to the garden so the story of Somer and the community can be told, she said.\n\nSomer\u2019s Garden epitomizes Obama\u2019s garden initiative. Somer\u2019s Garden also is a story of triumph in the face of unspeakable tragedy, Kohl said.\n\n\u201cWe all feel strongly that Somer\u2019s Garden it is a powerful story to tell and it would benefit the nation to share what we\u2019re doing and what we\u2019ve done,\u201d said Kohl, adding the garden illustrates how a community comes together during a tragedy.\n\nAs the first publicly accessible food forest garden in Northeast Florida, it also shows a path for community gardens to become self-sustaining using permaculture techniques, she said.\n\n\u201cPeople are invited to go on in whenever they want and harvest or plant or take part. We just think that goes with her mission .\u201d Kohl said of Obama\u2019s garden and \u201cLet\u2019s Move\u201d initiative.\n\nRight now, the garden is only at half to three-quarters of its capacity. Volunteers are needed to help finish planting, and to assist with upcoming projects they\u2019d ideally like to complete in time for the anniversary, Kohl said.\n\nKohl said they are working on signs to let people know the name of the garden, that it\u2019s open to the public and to explain its purpose and origins. Lighting also is needed for the garden, she said.\n\n\u201cAlso we\u2019re working on the wheelchair-accessible bed. It\u2019s a raised vegetable bed that we\u2019re going to be putting in this year,\u201d Kohl said.\n\nKohl also said the garden shows what can be done what can be done in an area of the country that struggles with food insecurity and food deserts. They want Obama and the rest of the nation to know that people are making a difference throughout Northeast Florida working to solve food scarcity issues in the area.\n\n\u201cThey are using education and are getting people moving in order to make things happen for the betterment of the community,\u201d Kohl said of the message they hope to share with Somer\u2019s Garden.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The (Jacksonville) Florida Times-Union, http://www.jacksonville.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Somer's Garden marks it first anniversary April 23.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/apr/10/somers-garden-in-orange-park-grows-from-tragedy/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "Somer\u2019s Garden marks it first anniversary April 23.", "title": "Somer\u2019s Garden in Orange Park grows from tragedy"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "description": "Somer's Garden marks it first anniversary April 23.", "card": "summary", "title": "Somer\u2019s Garden in Orange Park grows from tragedy"}, "Author": "TERESA STEPZINSKI", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "ORANGE PARK, Fla.
