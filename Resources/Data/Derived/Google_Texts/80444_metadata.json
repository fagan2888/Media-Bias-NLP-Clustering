Reuters\n\nWe know Americans are sleep deprived \u2014 but is their income partly to blame?\n\nPerhaps, suggests the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Researchers looked at the relationships between sleep and income level, as well as their effects on an estimated 35,000 households. The results showed 35 percent of people living around the federal poverty line (which New York Magazine\u2019s Science of Us cited was $29,000 for a family of four in 2013) slept less than six hours per night.\n\nOn the other hand, only 25 percent of people living 400 percent above the poverty line ($94,000 for a family of four) slept less than six hours per night. While households from both metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas were included, researchers didn\u2019t find any significant differences between the two, suggesting money makes more of a difference than location.\n\nScience of Us pointed out the report is vague in that it doesn\u2019t quite explain the link between income and sleep, and speculated people with low income do tend to work multiple jobs and spend more time commuting than those with high income, which could account for the sleep differences. In fact, The Washington Post cited a study that found \u201cshort sleepers,\u201d or people who get less than six hours of sleep per night, tend to trade their shuteye for more time to do work. Multiple job holders were also \u201c61 percent more likely than others to report sleeping 6 hours of less on weekdays.\u201d\n\nWhatever the case, getting an adequate amount of sleep per night continues to be a problem; The National Sleep Foundation recommends adults get between seven and nine hours of sleep per night. A lack of sleep impairs health, from poor attention and alertness, to increased chances of developing diseases, such as obesity and diabetes.\n\nPoor sleep also impairs sex drive. A small study recently published in the Journal of Sexual Medicine found women who sleep more on a given night experience greater sexual desire the next day. Sleep was also important for arousal, with women who sleep more experiencing fewer problems getting aroused than women who sleep less.\n\nObviously earning more income takes time and effort, But families might be able to get more sleep if they're more mindful of unsuspecting sleep thiefs, such as continually choosing to work late into the night on a smartphone or smart device that emits blue, melatonin-disrupting light.\n\nSource: Black LI, and Gindi RM.
