The practice is primarily performed in the Middle East and Africa, but unfortunately, it has cropped up on other continents \u2014 the U.S. is no exception. New York in particular sees too much of it, as it has the second-highest number of women and girls at risk for FGM in the country.\n\nFollowing only California, New York is home to about 48,000 women and girls deemed to be at risk for FGM, a figure based on ties to countries with a high prevalence of FGM. This is almost 10 percent of all at-risk females in the U.S. (about 500,000), and 13 percent of these live in the New York City metropolitan area. New legislation hopes to reduce these numbers.\n\nIllegal under federal law, FGM is not widely understood throughout the country. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo signed legislation in November that will add information about the \u201cphysical, sexual, and psychological consequences of undergoing female genital mutilation\u201d to the state\u2019s \u201chealth care and wellness education and outreach.\u201d\n\nIn the most common types of FGM, the clitoris is partially or completely removed. In a rarer form called infibulation, all external female genetalia is removed and the vulva is sowed shut, requiring another procedure to open it for childbirth. The World Health Organization calls FGM a \u201cviolation of the human rights of girls and women\u201d that \u201creflects deep rooted inequality between the sexes.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an accurate description: the practice has exactly zero health benefits, inhibits sexual function, and can cause several physical complications including infection, pain, and even infertility.\n\nLawmakers say that without publicizing the existence of the practice and its risks, there isn\u2019t much hope for effective enforcement of the laws we have in place to prevent FGM. One example was that of New York City social worker Mariama Diallo, who told PBS this summer that she personally knew of four cases of \"vacation cutting,\" the practice of sending a girl out of the country to be cut (also illegal). In one of the cases, the girl apparently tried to get help from her school guidance counselor after learning that her family was planning to send her to Africa for FGM.\n\n\u201cShe spoke with the guidance counselor, who did not know what she was talking about,\u201d Diallo said. \u201cAnd the guidance counselor sent her back home. And I think if it was another case where the child went to see a guidance counselor, told them something as simple as, \u2018I don\u2019t feel safe. I\u2019m not going back home,\u2019 they would call the Children\u2019s Services. But with FGM, they see it as a cultural problem. So, they don\u2019t want to get involved.\u201d\n\nNew York\u2019s campaign to raise awareness is taking shape, according to Shelby Quast, the Americas director for Equality Now, an international human-rights organization that has taken a leadership role in advocating for FGM awareness. \u201cJust because there\u2019s a law on the books doesn\u2019t mean people are aware of it,\u201d she told The Daily Beast. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that hospitals, physicians, teachers, or individual communities are aware of it. So there has to be a lot of public awareness raising.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "female, genital, mutilation, happens, new, york, too, new, legislation, aims, raise, awareness", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Commonly thought of as a foreign issue, FGM is happening in the U.S. too \u2014 not many people are aware of it.", "title": "New Law Aims To Lower Rates Of Female Genital Mutilation In New York", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/female-genital-mutilation-happens-new-york-too-new-legislation-aims-raise-awareness-363936", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/12/04/razor.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Commonly thought of as a foreign issue, FGM is happening in the U.S. too \u2014 not many people are aware of it.", "title": "New Law Aims To Lower Rates Of Female Genital Mutilation In New York", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/female-genital-mutilation-happens-new-york-too-new-legislation-aims-raise-awareness-363936", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/12/04/razor.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/12/04/razor.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Hill", "published_time": "2015-12-04T11:27:44-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-04T11:27:43-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Commonly thought of as a foreign issue, FGM is happening in the U.S. too \u2014 not many people are aware of it."}, "article_summary": "\u201cShe spoke with the guidance counselor, who did not know what she was talking about,\u201d Diallo said.\nAnd I think if it was another case where the child went to see a guidance counselor, told them something as simple as, \u2018I don\u2019t feel safe.\n\u201cAnd the guidance counselor sent her back home.\nduncan c (CC BY-NC 2.0)Female genital mutilation (FGM) is often thought of as a distinctly foreign issue.\nFGM, since it is illegal, is often performed by someone who is not a licensed doctor in unsanitary conditions."}
