Carromero was given a statement from the Cuban security officers that he was mandated to read on camera, and he subsequently participated in a rigged trial.\n\nCarromero was sentenced to four years in prison for vehicular homicide. He later returned to Spain, where he retracted all of his statements that he was forced to make under duress.\n\nThe fatal flaw in the botched Carromero trial is a direct result of the Cuban judicial system, the Human Rights Foundation report found.\n\nCuba is a totalitarian dictatorship, and the investigation and trials looking into the deaths of Pay\u00e1 and Cepero were carried out in the expected authoritarian manner, the report said.\n\nJavier El-Hage, general counsel for the Human Rights Foundation, presented the findings of the report at Georgetown University Wednesday. El-Hage explained that Cuban lawyers, unlike counsel in all other parts of the world, must defend the interests of the government, not the interest of their clients.\n\nUnderstanding the judicial system in Cuba is integral to understanding why Carromero\u2019s trial and the investigation into Pay\u00e1\u2019s death was a sham, El-Hage explained.\n\nAll attorneys in Cuba have to register with a national guild in order to practice. The lawyers must abide by a code of ethics, legally compelling them to \u201cconsciously assume and contribute\u2014within their duties\u2014to defend, preserve and be faithful to the principles comprised in the nation, the revolution and socialism.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, their jobs should be done \u201cimbued with the righteous, noble and humane ideas of socialism and inspired by the example set by the Commander in Chief Fidel Castro Ruz.\u201d\n\nAs a result, the Human Rights Foundation report turns attention away from Carromero\u2019s false confession and instead suggests \u201cdirect government responsibility\u201d in the deaths of Pay\u00e1 and Cepero.\n\nSpecifically, the evidence suggests that the state agents were acting in one of three states of mind. Cuban officials were acting with the intent to kill Pay\u00e1 and the passengers, with the intent to \u201cinflict grievous bodily harm\u201d to them or with \u201creckless or depraved indifference\u201d to their lives.\n\nEach of these possibilities accounts for the state of mind necessary to be charged with murder in the eyes of international law, El-Hage said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Human Rights Foundation released a report suggesting that the Cuban government may have killed famous Cuban dissident Oswaldo Pay\u00e1.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The Human Rights Foundation released a report suggesting that the Cuban government may have killed famous Cuban dissident Oswaldo Pay\u00e1.", "title": "Report Suggests Castro Assassinated Pro-Democracy Activist", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Oswaldo-Paya-feature-edit.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-07-24T22:27:23+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1emEzUJ"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The Human Rights Foundation released a report suggesting that the Cuban government may have killed famous Cuban dissident Oswaldo Pay\u00e1.", "title": "Report Suggests Castro Assassinated Pro-Democracy Activist", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Oswaldo-Paya-feature-edit.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "International", "tag": "Latin American", "published_time": "2015-07-24T17:19:41+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-24T22:27:23+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Oswaldo Paya, Cuba, Human Rights Foundation report, assassination, dissident, democracy"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1ced\"", "article_summary": "In their legal report, the Human Rights Foundation highlighted the inaccuracies and inconsistencies in the Cuban government\u2019s investigation into Pay\u00e1\u2019s death.\nThe fatal flaw in the botched Carromero trial is a direct result of the Cuban judicial system, the Human Rights Foundation report found.\nJavier El-Hage, general counsel for the Human Rights Foundation, presented the findings of the report at Georgetown University Wednesday.\nOn the third anniversary of the death of famous Cuban dissident Oswaldo Pay\u00e1, the Human Rights Foundation released a report suggesting that the Cuban government may have killed him.\n\u201cThe power in Havana believed it was necessary to destroy my father,\u201d said Rosa Maria Pay\u00e1, the daughter of the late activist."}
