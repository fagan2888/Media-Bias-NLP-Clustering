Switch-pitcher — yes, pitcher — Pat Venditte made his debut for the Oakland A’s Friday night against the Boston Red Sox (Watch the video).

It was a nice outing for the 29-year-old, who allowed one hit and had a strikeout in two shutout innings.

It also marked the debut of “The Venditte Rule,” which was established by Major League Baseball in 2008 after he was drafted by the New York Yankees in 2008.
