SHUTDOWN IMPASS-DEBT DEFAULT THREATENED

The government shutdown is having far reaching effects and is inflicting pain on the American people. About 35 Tea Party members, led by Sen. Ted Cruz, is holding our country hostage by placing a gun to the head of Speaker John Boehner. They have threatened to take away his speaker ship if he allows a vote on the senate bill that reflects Republican Paul Ryan’s budget. All Boehnerhas to do is call for an up or down vote in the Congress and let the two party members decide, yes or no. It’s that simple, but instead Cruz and the extremist demigods want to play with the Affordable Care Act, which is already decided and the law of the land. When the American people didn’t buy that story, they switched to the deficit. They’re wrong again. The deficit is coming down faster than at any time since WWII and has been cut in half in the last five years. One of the most heartbreaking effects of this is having funds cut off to bury military personnel killed defending our country and not paying benifits to the suviors. However, there’s much more harm done by a handful of extremist. They are hurting good, reasonable Republicans just wanting to do the people’s work. Boehner, at some point, will have to take the sword and say enough. If he lets this small group of radicals drive our country into default on Oct 17, the effects worldwide would be devastating. We have never defaulted before. The debt ceiling is just paying bills that the Congress has already spent. This handful of Tea Party congressmen come from safe, gerrymandered districts so they don’t care about their fellow Republicans or worry about their re-elections. One of those extremist is our own congressman Steve Stockman, who can do absolutely nothing to help us. We pay him $180,000 a year plus perks and all we get from him is a government shutdown and a threat to take the country over the cliff. Contact him and let him know how you feel. He may ignore you because he doesn’t need Orange County to be reelected.*****Gotta go. Please come along, I promise it won’t do you no harm.

CAN LOCAL GET ELECTED STATE REP.

State Rep. Allen Ritter won ‘t run for re-election in 2014. He has served in the House since 1998, many of those years as a Democrat. He switched to the Republican Party when the district was re-districted. Two years ago, it was redistricted again taking in all of Orange County, Mid County and portions of Beaumont. That move left Orange County without a local state representative for the first time in over 60 years. Rep. Ritter has a lot of seniority and clout in Austin. Several candidates will line up to replace him. It would be great if someone from Orange County could get elected but that might be a high step in a gerrymandered district. A couple of potential Orange County candidates have met with Ritter. Some folks have been urging County Judge Carl Thibodeaux to run since the Texas House meets only every other year and would be a work load cutback for Thibodeaux. At this time he says his main interest is to get the County back on even keel. Orange County will have a candidate and here is how a local candidate could win and Orange County again have a representative. If several candidates rum from Jefferson County that will split the vote, then the Orange County candidate could win the primary. It can be done but the candidate would need solid local support. Chances are the candidate would serve only one term. Next time Jefferson County would run one candidate and could out vote Orange County. The most important thing is not what party, as much as again getting Orange County representation in Austin.

A FEW HAPPENINGS

For years we have known Frank and Joe Barrientos but had never met their brother Tom until he visited the office. He knows a lot of Orange County history. They were all raised at Rebeck Crossing, a Mexican settlement near IH-10 and 16th Street. Tom now lives in Call, not to be confused with Call Junction. Call is the birth place of the late Frank Manchec and Don Shockley.*****Also visiting was the very interesting and knowledgeable Raymond Gilbeaux, who makes a hobby of collecting Orange County history.*****I have an answer to the Washington Redskin name problem. Just name the team “The Natives” and keep all the same Indian paraphernalia. *****For several years Orange County didn’t get much attention from our state senator. That is no longer the case. Sen. Nichols and his staff are constantly in touch with our county. Sen. Nichols’ assistant, J.D. Hale, is a very accommodating and very dedicated young man. If you need assistance, you’ll get quick response. That’s a welcomed change. Our previous senator came from the Woodlands. At least Sen. Nichols is an East Texas boy from Jacksonville and Orange County is one of his largest counties which wasn’t the case before.*****A few good folks we know having birthdays in the next few days. Oct. 9 findsLinda Myers, Imogene Bailey, Betty Stimac and Susan Ayre celebrating.***On Oct. 10, Bob Bullard, Janell Matthews and Jessica Frankin share birthdays with former NFL QB Brett Favre, who turns 44 also celebrating is our friend Mac McCullough, who turns 92.***On Oct. 11 Anita Ryan, retired Orangefield counselor turns a year older as does Leslie Anderson, John Cochran, Barbara Nixon and Preston Pittman, now a student at Blinn.***Oct. 12 is the birthday of Timothy Tremont, Orangefield educator, who works with special needs. One of his buddies is Mark Walles.Also celebrating is Miltion Briggs III, Sharon and Logan Burns, and Dick Gregory, 81. This would also have been the birthday of the late Brad Lapeyrlerie.***Oct. 13 finds Anita Triggs, Edna Collins and Jason Sellers celebrating.. Our buddy Nova Dee Strickland turns 81 on this day also. She was born on Friday.***Oct. 14 is Columbus Day and our friend Harry Stephens, who also came over on the “Mayflower” with Chris, celebrates his special day. I’m sure Margie has something special planned. Marking birthdays also is Stacy Rhodes, Eloise Stewart, Martha Kile, Trey Miller and Olivia Hubbard.***On Oct. 15, C.J. Benoit turns 89. He is a longtime Orangefield resident who does woodwork and volunteer work at Thrift and Gift and the Paul Cormier Museum. C.J. seems to get younger with each day. Also celebrating is Becky LaFleur, Derek Borel, Sonny Childs and Nancy Newton. Lastly special birthday goes out to a special guy and public servant Judge Carl Thibodaux. Happy birthday to all. Please see complete birthday list.*****Halle Berry, at age 47, gave birth to a son Saturday. Five years ago, at age 42, she gave birth to her daughter. Both kids have different dads. She will be 66 when the boy graduates from high school.*****This might surprise you.Thomas Monson, president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, announced Saturdaythat the Mormon Church now totals 15 million worldwide members.

Wendy Davis announced for governor. The poll showed she was only eight points behind Abbott. More surprising is that she lead 51 to 49 percent with Republican women. That putAbbott and company on a fast track to destroy her early. They have started negative radio spots in both English and Spanish. No doubt about it, the good old boy network is scared. They know Texas voters yearn for a change. I believe they have Perry burnout and Abbott would be more of the same.*****We heard from Jason Menard, formerly of Bridge City, who has just re-enlisted in the Army. Jason has only seven more years of service to retire after serving 20 years in the military.*****We welcome Nissan of Silsbee to our advertising family. They are very nice people and I’m told so easy to deal with.

C’EST TOUT

The United States continues to track and capture terrorists wherever they try to hide. Last SaturdayPresident Obama signed off on a plan to capture fugitive terrorist that led to the capture of Nazih Abdul-Hamed al-Ruqai, a suspected leader of Al Qaeda. Abu Anas was indicted in 2000 for his role in the 1998 bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagelsaid “The United States would not hesitate to take similar action in the future. We will continue to maintain relentless pressure on terrorist groups that threaten our people or our interest and we will conduct direct action against them.”*****Point of interest: Did you know that East Texas has one congressman, from the Dallas-Fort Worth area. Southeast Texas has one congressman from the Houston area. Rural counties are getting screwed because these congressmen don’t view our areas as their priority. They won’t help grow rural Texas. That all goes back to Tom Delay and Rick Perry’sredistricting and attorney general Greg Abbot is fighting to keep it that way. Remember when it wasn’t that way? We voted against out own interest that’s why.*****Patronize our advertisers and visit us at therecordlive.com. Take care and God bless America.
