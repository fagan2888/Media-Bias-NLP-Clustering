As averages hover near peaks, is a cliff dive ahead?\n\nWASHINGTON, March 3, 2015 \u2013 The Maven, like so many others, is getting incredibly frustrated with this stock market. It\u2019s up one day, one day down, up, down, rinse, repeat. Yesterday, after a weak opening, stocks generally closed up. Today, guess what? Yep. Stocks are, for the most part, getting hit every which way but up.\n\nIt all reminds us of that wondrously absurd \u201cCaucus Race\u201d we encounter early on in Lewis Carroll\u2019s always-entertaining \u201cAlice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland.\u201d Because the Maven is pressed for time and incapable of being brief, here\u2019s an excerpt from what Wikipedia says on the subject:\n\n\u201cIn order to get dry after a swim, the Dodo proposes that everyone run a Caucus race \u2014 where the participants run in patterns of any shape, starting and leaving off whenever they like, so that everyone wins. At the end of the race, Alice distribute comfits [confections] from her pocket to all as prizes. However this leaves no prize for herself. The Dodo inquires what else she has in her pocket. As she has only a thimble, the Dodo requests it from her and then awards it to Alice as her prize. The Caucus Race as depicted by Carroll is a satire on the political caucus system, mocking its lack of clarity and decisiveness.\u201d\n\nThere is so much good information buried in this paragraph that we\u2019re tempted to digress, particularly on the political \u201cclarity and decisiveness\u201d part. But the real focus here is the market, which, in fact, has become an actual, real-life Caucus Race lately, save for the fact that there are actually many losers whose portfolios continue to shrink as they run round and round.\n\nWhat charts are telling us is that stocks in general are getting \u201ccongested.\u201d That is, they\u2019re trading up and down, up and down in ever-narrower ranges and bands, indicating that at some point soon, they\u2019re either going to rocket up or plummet down, big time. The negative angle is reinforced when you look at the charts of numerous representative stock group ETFs or even the stocks themselves.\n\nAn example of how a bearish descending wedge looks appears below in an old chart of Dell Computer (DELL), which, as many readers will know, is no longer publicly traded.\n\nMore often than not, as the wedge narrows, the tendency of the stock is to suddenly fall pretty much without notice, although, if the wedge gets impossibly narrow, you know the time is nigh. As with everything in chart-ology (technical analysis), the charts can and are wrong. But so many people use them nowadays that they often become self-fulfilling prophecies.\n\nSpecifically, we have begun to see these bearish descending wedges and other equally negative patterns in stocks and representative ETFs, indicating that at least near-term, we\u2019re likely to get hit hard with a 5-15% downdraft. We just don\u2019t know when.\n\nThe charts are saying \u201cVery soon.\u201d But we\u2019re not quite in \u201csell in May\u201d territory yet. Furthermore, tech stocks and small caps are to some extent resisting this trend, while large caps are getting hurt, given that international sales profitability is going to get nicked by the ever-increasing dollar, added to our inability to export our surplus oil, courtesy of, you guessed it, Washington.\n\nWhat\u2019s more problematic here is a considerable weakening in one of the engines of the still somewhat ongoing 2-year rally in healthcare stocks. The profits here have been generous indeed, but nothing goes up forever.\n\nDrug companies and insurance companies made a devil\u2019s bargain with Harry Reid\u2019s and Nancy Pelosi\u2019s old Democrat mega-majorities to cram the wildly imperfect Obamacare (ADA) Frankenstein monster down an unwilling American throat. But an upcoming Supreme Court decision, likely to show up in June, could upend the whole monetary spoils system by actually interpreting the law as written: i.e., no insurance subsidies will be given to constituents of states that don\u2019t run their own exchanges.\n\nDespite Democrats\u2019 pooh-poohing of this \u201ctechnicality,\u201d which the Obama Administration\u2019s Gestapo-like IRS was clearly told to ignore, the law was intentionally written that way to coerce the states to set up their own exchanges. But, knowing a structurally bad deal when they saw one, fully 37 states opted out, meaning their citizens would have to use the general Federal exchange system and software.\n\nThat should have meant no subsidies, for this is an Administration and Democrat Party that believes in roundly punishing dissent. But that got waived\u2014since the Dems had to get through another electoral cycle. If what the Administration has on Chief Justice Roberts doesn\u2019t work this time as it did the last time he unexpectedly bailed them out, we\u2019re looking at a very real mess in June.\n\nWhich\u2014getting us back to those healthcare stocks\u2014might be at least part of the reason they\u2019re backing off from their highs right now. We\u2019re still in that sector, via the healthcare ETF (XLV). But it\u2019s getting wobbly, and we may be forced to bail soon. That\u2019s because if this one tanks, nobody will want to look at the bloody body parts at the bottom of a very steep cliff.\n\nToday\u2019s trading tips\n\nWe\u2019ll have more to say about Obamacare and other matters in other columns. But right now our main point is, unless you\u2019re a day-trader and a good one, it\u2019s best to sell a few profitable positions, pare mildly negative ones that look like they\u2019ll get worse, and raise some cash.\n\nEven the Maven, despite his obvious brilliance and insight, is finding it tough to make even a few bucks right now without taking undue risk. Trading is simply getting Dumb and Dumber as the HFTs jack stocks up today and take them down tomorrow on low volume, indicating real investors are staying home. With that kind of mindless and obvious manipulation going on, our main tip is\u2014go and find something else to do for awhile. You\u2019ll lose less money.\n\n* Fair use.
