On top of that, they don\u2019t advocate policies that\u2019ll win large blocks of voters.\n\nYet the Republicans on Capitol Hill are under a mystical trance, carrying the big business legislative agenda forward at seemingly any cost.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nTake immigration reform, for example. Opening the immigration floodgates is at the top of the Chamber of Commerce\u2019s agenda.\n\nPOLITICO Magazine recently reported that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce President, Tom Donohue, said, \u201cThe GOP shouldn\u2019t even field a presidential candidate in 2016 unless Congress passes immigration reform this year.\u201d\n\nAnd the National Association of Manufacturers President, Jay Timmons, said he \u201calso thought immigration reform could pass this year, perhaps in a lame-duck session.\u201d Timmons called immigration reform a \u201cunified position of the business community.\u201d\n\nSo it\u2019s no surprise that John Boehner is in lockstep with these two and is pushing for increased immigration, despite polling data that says the political outcome will be similar to drinking cyanide.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nMeanwhile, the push for increased immigration has some seriously harmful impacts on middle-income families. American firms continue to cut payrolls, lay off workers, and hold down pay increases, while they push for immigrants to come and compete with current workers.\n\nBusinesses always use the throwaway line, \u201cAmericans won\u2019t do these jobs anyway.\u201d But this lie is laid bare by Facebook (FB), Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), and other high-tech firms that would like to import software developers from India and other low-wage countries. As the flood of legal and illegal immigrants reaches our shores, Americans continue to suffer wage stagnation.\n\nOne of the few opponents of the immigration plan is Alabama Republican Jeff Sessions. His spokesman, Stephen Miller, told POLITICO Magazine that immigration reform \u201cwould also triple the admission of largely lower-skilled, permanent immigrants over the next decade \u2013 from 10 million to 30 million. Immigration reform should mean putting unemployed Americans back to work, not replacing them at a lower cost.\u201d\n\nThe Grand Old (Misguided) Party\n\nUnfortunately, immigration reform isn\u2019t the only issue on which Republicans are carrying water for big business.\n\nIf the party wants to reconnect with the middle class, it could do so by rejecting crony capitalism, getting rid of the Export-Import Bank, and eliminating the subsidies to dubious \u201cgreen energy\u201d businesses. The federal budget has too many dollars that are misdirected to Corporate America.\n\nOn top of that, Republicans need to push initiatives to fire up job creation for middle-income workers. Open up oil fracking opportunities on federal land, force the Keystone Pipeline through the bureaucratic morass of the Obama stonewalls, cut taxes on smaller businesses that are creating jobs, and repeal Obamacare.\n\nThese actions \u2013 as opposed to pushing for immigration reform \u2013 would allow Republicans to win some crucial races come Election Day.\n\nThis commentary originally appeared at WallStreetDaily.com and is reprinted here with permission.\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by the owners of this website.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Unfortunately, he also may find out too late.", "author": "Floyd Brown", "og": {"site_name": "Western Journalism", "description": "Unfortunately, he also may find out too late.", "title": "What John Boehner Is Doing Could Cost Him Big Time", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1024, "identifier": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/John-Boehner-SC.jpg", "height": 731}, "updated_time": "2014-05-19T11:30:30-07:00", "url": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/exposed-john-boehners-big-business-agenda/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Unfortunately, he also may find out too late.", "creator": "@floydbrown", "image": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/John-Boehner-SC.jpg", "title": "What John Boehner Is Doing Could Cost Him Big Time", "site": "@WestJournalism", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2014-05-15T10:55:36-07:00", "fb": {"app_id": 275784739127435, "pages": 123624513983}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/android-chrome-192x192.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WesternJournalism", "section": "Featured Stories", "tag": "John Boehner", "published_time": "2014-05-15T10:55:36-07:00", "modified_time": "2014-05-19T11:30:30-07:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "crony capitalism, illegal immigration, john boehner, politics, nation, religion"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcff2\"", "article_summary": "These actions \u2013 as opposed to pushing for immigration reform \u2013 would allow Republicans to win some crucial races come Election Day.\nYet the Republicans on Capitol Hill are under a mystical trance, carrying the big business legislative agenda forward at seemingly any cost.\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues belowTake immigration reform, for example.\nImmigration reform should mean putting unemployed Americans back to work, not replacing them at a lower cost.\u201dThe Grand Old (Misguided) PartyUnfortunately, immigration reform isn\u2019t the only issue on which Republicans are carrying water for big business.\nUnfortunately, the Speaker of the House, John Boehner, is too busy catering to the business elite to capitalize on this incredible opportunity; and his single-minded approach could result in some tragic electoral defeats."}
