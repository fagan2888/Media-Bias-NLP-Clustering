The SEC is seeking sanctions and financial penalties against four insurance agents who allegedly steered dozens of elderly investors to an investment scheme that promised safe returns but spent their money on mortgage payments and commissions.

The agents were recruited by Gary Snisky, who allegedly used his Longmont-based company, Arete, LLC., to target elderly annuity holders, the Denver office of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said Friday.

The scheme raised $4.3 million from more than 40 investors in eight states during an 18-month period. Snisky allegedly used much of the money



to pay his mortgage and cover the agents’ commissions, the SEC said when it filed charges against him in November. That case is pending in federal court in Colorado

The SEC said three of the agents raised approximately $1.5 million for Snisky, promising the investors their money was being invested in safe government-backed bonds. The agents — Kenneth C. Meissner of Fair Oaks Branch, Tex., James Doug Scott of Perkasie, Penn., and Mark S. Tomich of Belmont, Mich. — were paid a total of $90,000 in commissions.

A fourth agent, David C. Sorrells of Linden, Texas, entered into an agreement with the SEC under which he is banned from working in the securities industry and is required to return $207,213 to the government.

The SEC said Sorrells provided substantial assistance during the investigation.
