Google has announced that it will be changing its algorithm to use more mobile-friendly factors in its mobile search results on April 21, 2015, so if your site is not currently optimized for mobile devices, your page ranking will likely suffer.

According to the Google announcement:

Starting April 21, we will be expanding our use of mobile-friendliness as a ranking signal. This change will affect mobile searches in all languages worldwide and will have a significant impact in our search results. Consequently, users will find it easier to get relevant, high quality search results that are optimized for their devices.

In addition, Google said that apps indexed by Google via App Indexing will rank better in mobile search. For now, this will only be true for Android apps.

To determine if your website is already mobile-friendly — and thus ready for this algorithm update — you can use Google’s mobile-friendly test. Just click on the link, enter your website and the analysis will be performed immediately.

If your website comes up as not mobile-friendly, talk to your website designer/developer about converting it by the April 21 deadline. It is now clear that those law firm websites that are not optimized for mobile will appear lower in search results beginning April 21.

Google rarely gives businesses an opportunity to protect their search ranking prior to an algorithm update. You now have fair warning, which I encourage you to heed.
