Alan Bates, D-Medford, that the agencies hold back 2 percent of their funding until this year, when the state would have a better estimate of economic conditions in the second half of the 2013-15 biennium.\n\nThe state\u2019s economy has improved in the past year, but that good news will likely cause the state budget to run up against Oregon\u2019s quirky kicker law -- which returns a portion of the revenues that exceed state economic forecast to individual taxpayers.\n\n\u201cA lot of really critical programs could lose a lot of money,\u201d said Doug Riggs, a contract lobbyist for Care Oregon and the Oregon Primary Care Association.\n\nEarlier this month, DHS Director Erinn Kelley-Siel presented legislators with a total funding gap of $101 million -- including $46 million that had been held back by the Legislature, $7.8 million from federal sequestration cuts and the rest from increased labor costs after the collective bargaining agreements were settled.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not asking for an extra $100 million,\u201d Kelley-Siel said. \u201cWe have some work to do to get to a balanced budget.\u201d\n\nThe hold back money amounts to $14 million for senior services and $11 million in cuts to services for the disabled.\n\n\u201cThere will be a little food fight over this before we\u2019re through, I\u2019m sure,\u201d Bates told Kelley-Siel. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see us cutting programs because we didn\u2019t set aside enough money. We\u2019ll be in this fight with you.\u201d\n\nThe hold back put less stress on the Oregon Health Authority budget, amounting to $35 million. The health authority had a number of savings thanks to the Affordable Care Act, including greater than expected Medicaid enrollees amounted to more federal money coming into the state. Oregon also won a $24 million bonus from the high number of children it enrolled, which may be able to offset much of the difference.\n\nThe legislative budget chairman, Sen. Richard Devlin, D-Tualatin, said that it would be very difficult to restore the 2 percent to either agency\u2019s budget, and he expected after the state burned through $40 million fighting fires that the Legislature may only be able to give back a quarter of the money being held in reserve.\n\n\u201cThe rebalance of the budgets for the Department of Human Services and also the Oregon Health Authority will be major subjects of the February session,\u201d Devlin said. \u201cIf we were to give the entire 2 percent back now, we could have a dangerously low ending fund.\u201d\n\nGiven the unpredictability, Rep. Dennis Richardson, R-Central Point, asked that the Legislature grant them even less money: \u201cIt\u2019s a very risky thing to give anything back, in my opinion,\u201d he said.\u201d\n\nBut other than the 2 percent hold back, DHS should be able to make up much of the $100 million gap that represents increased labor costs. Rep. Peter Buckley, D-Ashland, said other parts of the overall budget had set aside costs for collective bargaining.\n\nSpending for Seniors\n\nWhile some social service programs could hit a snag, services for senior citizens could still see a boost in funding thanks to an October change to the state income tax code.\n\nIn the fall special session, legislators voted to scale back a tax deduction that allowed people over 62 to write off household medical expenses from their state income taxes. The tax break overwhelmingly favored wealthy households and its cost to the state was growing exponentially, said Dale Penn of the Oregon Health Care Association.\n\nPenn\u2019s organization is spearheading the Campaign for Oregon\u2019s Seniors and People with Disabilities, which has a list of $24 million in spending priorities for the Legislature to approve.\n\nIf the senior medical tax deduction as configured was not the best state policy, the state had many programs where the state could use the money for seniors more effectively, Penn said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve talked to leadership on both sides,\u201d Penn told The Lund Report. \u201cThey\u2019re very supportive of [the list], but we have to wait and see what happens in February.\u201d\n\nThe list includes $3 million for Oregon Project Independence, a popular bipartisan program that pays for caregivers and allows middle-class seniors to stay in their homes.\n\nPenn said Oregon Project Independence is frequently on the chopping block because it leans heavily on state general funds and supports seniors who do not qualify for federal assistance like Medicaid.\n\nThe campaign asks that the state spend $3.75 million for the Area Agencies on Aging to offset federal austerity cuts caused by sequestration, including $1.25 million for nutritional programs and evidence-based health promotion and disease programs.\n\nTwo other big budget items are $3.5 million in senior mental health and $3.3 million in caregiver training. Taken together, these two items could help geriatric patients leave the Oregon State Hospital and find homes in their own communities.\n\nJon Bartholomew, the public policy director of the Alzheimer\u2019s Association, Oregon Chapter, said the increased funding for programs like caregiver training and $925,000 to set up a public guardianship program were among his organization\u2019s top legislative priorities this session as well.\n\nSen. Michael Dembrow, D-Portland, has reintroduced Senate Bill 1553, which would set up a public guardianship program for indigent seniors within the Office of the Long-term Care Ombudsman. Some elderly patients with Alzheimer\u2019s end up at the state mental hospital by default for lack of anyone to make important care decisions for them. A similar bill passed last session but was moot for lack of funding.\n\n\u201cNow that we have this $26 million, we can actually do something with it,\u201d Bartholomew said of the program envisioned in Dembrow\u2019s bill.", "article_metadata": {"MobileOptimized": "width", "viewport": "width=device-width", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "HandheldFriendly": "true"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcaec9\"", "article_summary": "Taken together, these two items could help geriatric patients leave the Oregon State Hospital and find homes in their own communities.\nThe tax break overwhelmingly favored wealthy households and its cost to the state was growing exponentially, said Dale Penn of the Oregon Health Care Association.\nTwo other big budget items are $3.5 million in senior mental health and $3.3 million in caregiver training.\nWe\u2019ll be in this fight with you.\u201dThe hold back put less stress on the Oregon Health Authority budget, amounting to $35 million.\n\u201cA lot of really critical programs could lose a lot of money,\u201d said Doug Riggs, a contract lobbyist for Care Oregon and the Oregon Primary Care Association."}
