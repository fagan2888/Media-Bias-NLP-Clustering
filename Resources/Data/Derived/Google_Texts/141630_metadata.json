Jerry Brown (D) appointed Jennifer Kent as the new director of the Department of Health Care Services, a $9 billion state agency that oversees the Medi-Cal program.\n\nDHCS is the agency that oversees Medi-Cal.\n\nKent had most recently been the executive director of Local Health Plans of California, an organization representing 14 not-for-profit public health plans across the state.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very excited,\u201d Kent said. \u201cIt\u2019s a big job, so I\u2019m both thrilled and a little overwhelmed.\u201d\n\nKent replaces Toby Douglas, who was DHCS director for the past four years. Kent has worked at DHCS in the past \u2014 in fact, she and Douglas were both deputy directors in the department at the same time. Kent worked at the department from 2004 to 2007. She headed legislative affairs for Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger (R) and has experience in both the public and private spheres of health care.\n\nKent said she has big shoes to fill at the department and that the scope of change at the department has been unprecedented, topped by adding 2.7 million new enrollees to Medi-Cal and shifting more than 70% of beneficiaries into Medi-Cal managed care plans.\n\n\u201cI have watched the department lift the entire health care reform effort during a time of budget constraints, and set a national example,\u201d Kent said. \u201cSo first and foremost, I recognize that people at the department accomplished quite a lot in a short amount of time.\u201d\n\nNow that the move to Medi-Cal managed care has been put in place, she said, there is a lot of work to do to make it successful.\n\n\u201cWe have all put a lot of faith in the managed care system. Now we\u2019re shifting from implementation to operation and function,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are a managed care state in its entirety. \u2026 By and large we\u2019ve chosen a delivery system, so now we all have to make managed care work so that it\u2019s efficient and organized and accountable.\u201d\n\nThe biggest obstacle to making it work, she said, is the sheer size of the Medi-Cal program, which currently covers more than 30% of the population of California \u2014 and 50% of its children.\n\n\u201cThe magnitude of it,\u201d Kent said. \u201cIt\u2019s a big thing and it\u2019s really complicated, with lots of moving pieces.\u201d She said her familiarity with what the department has done and is doing should help smooth the transition.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve worked on the private side and the state side, so I have an appreciation for how the private sector thinks, and I also know how hard it is to move things on the government side,\u201d Kent said. \u201cThere are some things needed by plans and providers, and one of them is certainty. \u2026 We need to be a good business partner, we owe it to them to provide consistent rules.\u201d\n\nOne of the concerns raised in the state Legislature recently has been a need for greater monitoring of how Medi-Cal managed care is working, and whether quality and access are maintained.\n\n\u201cI do think the department has already done an extensive amount of that monitoring already. It\u2019s been started,\u201d Kent said. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly the right question to be asking. This system we\u2019ve chosen, is it doing what we expect it to do?\u201d\n\nSuccessful monitoring is based on good data, she said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an exciting cocktail conversation, but data is so important to monitor performance and reward quality,\u201d she said. \u201cYou want to find the providers who are doing it right so you can point to them and say, \u2018This is what we want to emulate.\u2019 And you can\u2019t do that without good data.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jennifer Kent will lead the $9 billion state agency that oversees the Medi-Cal program.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Governor Appoints New Director of Health Care Services\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2015\\/01\\/27\\/governor-appoints-new-director-of-health-care-services\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-01-27 11:13:00\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-01-27 12:04:25\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":23661,\"author_id\":\"8344\",\"author_name\":\"State of Health\",\"author_display_name\":\"State of Health\",\"tags\":[\"Medi-Cal\"],\"categories\":[\"Policy\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2015\\/01\\/Jennifer-Kent2-e1422384825678.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "Jennifer Kent will lead the $9 billion state agency that oversees the Medi-Cal program.", "title": "Governor Appoints New Director of Health Care Services", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2015/01/27/governor-appoints-new-director-of-health-care-services/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2015/01/Jennifer-Kent2-640x464.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "medi-cal", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Arnold Schwarzenegger (R) and has experience in both the public and private spheres of health care.\nJerry Brown (D) appointed Jennifer Kent as the new director of the Department of Health Care Services, a $9 billion state agency that oversees the Medi-Cal program.\n\u201cWe have all put a lot of faith in the managed care system.\n\u201cWe are a managed care state in its entirety.\nKent had most recently been the executive director of Local Health Plans of California, an organization representing 14 not-for-profit public health plans across the state."}
