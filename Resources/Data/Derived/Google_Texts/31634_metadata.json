George Holding (R-N.C.) was caught napping earlier this October while presiding over a House session. (C-SPAN)\n\nDemocrat aides said Reid is considering Republican proposals to replace a medical device tax imposed to fund Obamacare and impose income verification requirements for individuals who qualify for subsidies under Obamacare the healthcare law. But Democrats said those steps will require additional Republican concessions.\n\nA Reid-McConnell deal would probably clear the Senate easily, putting pressure on the Republican-run House to accept the agreement or risk missing the debt ceiling deadline which would likely rattle markets due to the risk the government will default on its debts.\n\nWhile conservatives in the House were already reacting angrily Monday to the potential deal, senators believe House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) will have no choice but to bring the Senate bill up for a vote, and allow it to pass with mostly Democratic votes.\n\nDemocrats believe Republican leaders are desperate for a way out of the showdown amid polls that show public blame for the shutdown putting the Republican Party at record low approval ratings.\n\nAn ABC News/Washington Post poll released Monday found 74% of Americans disapprove of the way congressional Republicans are handling the budget crisis, up from 63% when the shutdown started.\n\ndfriedman@nydailynews.com\n\nOn a mobile device?
