Ted Nugent, conservative rocker, roused a Las Vegas crowd with an inspiring rendition of the National Anthem — and with a patriotic expression of support for slain U.S. sniper Chris Kyle.

“Freedom isn’t free,” Mr. Nugent said, during a performance at the Outdoor Channel’s 15th annual Golden Moose Awards, The Blaze reported. “This is dedicated to the heroes of the military. God bless the military warriors, especially the snipers. God bless the snipers. This is for Chris Kyle and in defiance of all the pieces of [expletive] who don’t get it.”

Mr. Nugent was just recently in the news for praising a photo of Kid Rock holding a dead mountain lion.

“HAIL my MotorCity boy KidRock for saving all those muleteer elk & livestock by whacking this magnificent mountain lion,” he wrote in a post on his Facebook page, a few days ago.
