We must make our election between economy and liberty, or profusion and servitude.\u201d \u2013Thomas Jefferson (1816)\n\nCredit where credit is due \u2013 however deceitfully earned\u2026\n\nBarack Obama, whose policies and whose Democratic Party suffered a humiliating defeat a few months ago, has now effectively flanked Republican majorities in the legislative branch with his own legislative agenda, as outlined in his $3.99 TRILLION 2016 budget.\n\nLet\u2019s just call it an even $4 trillion, since we all know that the \u201c.99\u201d is just an absurd retail marketing gimmick. \u201cMy fellow Americans, all this can be yours for less than $4 trillion! And if you act now, we\u2019ll throw in a set of steak knives!\u201d\n\nAfter his ethereal State of the Union remarks two weeks ago, and with his approval rating rising slightly due to lower oil prices, which temporarily boosted GDP, Obama set off cross-country to promote his agenda under the fraudulent title \u201cMiddle-Class Economics,\u201d which should be more fittingly named \u201cMiddle-Crush Economics.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s put Obama\u2019s statist plunder into perspective.\n\nIf middle-class families set their annual household budgets the way Obama sets his, they would find themselves before a bankruptcy judge and their credit ruined for life. Fact is, Obama is banking his budget on the backs of every American household, and the burden is growing heavier by the minute.\n\nOur national debt is now $18.1 trillion \u2013 almost $8 trillion of that added by Obama in just the last six years. That\u2019s more than $145,000 per American household. For the record, $18 trillion in $100 bills would weigh in at almost 200,000 tons, about twice the weight of a Nimitz-class aircraft carrier. Measured another way, those same $100 bills would stack more than 12,000 miles high.\n\nObama\u2019s \u201cmiddle-class economy\u201d debt load on the American people is hard to fathom. And, as noted by Senate Budget Committee member Bob Corker (R-TN), \u201cDebt and deficits hurt the standard of living of Americans by slowing economic growth.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the weak fourth-quarter GDP figures, which conveniently arrived after Obama\u2019s self-congratulatory SOTU, were about half the growth rate of the third quarter \u2013 down to 2.6% in a seasonal quarter that should have been much better. As Joe Biden reminded us, \u201cTo state the obvious, the past six years have been really, really hard for this country.\u201d (gaffe [gaf] n. 1 an utterance in which a member of the Obama administration inadvertently tells the truth.)\n\nA new bipartisan Congressional Budget Office assessment, \u201cThe Budget and Economic Outlook: 2015 to 2025,\u201d warns the current debt growth rate is unsustainable, and notes \u201csuch large and growing federal debt would have serious negative consequences, including increasing federal spending for interest payments; restraining economic growth in the long term; giving policymakers less flexibility to respond to unexpected challenges; and eventually heightening the risk of a fiscal crisis.\u201d\n\nFor the record, regarding \u201cfiscal crisis,\u201d we\u2019ve been there, done that twice since 1929. But maintaining political constituencies trumps the threat of a cascading economic collapse \u2013 at least until the bread and soup lines form. And the failure of financial institutions \u2013 and economies \u2013 can occur very quickly, as was the case with the narrowly averted collapse in 2008.\n\nObama remains the undisputed master of deception when maintaining political constituencies, proposing his brazen budget as if the good times were rolling. His exemplar deceptio mirrors those methods perfected by Reich Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels, who would blush at the success Obama has enjoyed in utilizing his template for propagating misinformation.\n\nOn top of his administration\u2019s countless below-the-radar regulations, which are now costing consumers in all income brackets hundreds of billions of dollars, Obama\u2019s $4,000,000,000,000 budget is replete with more spending, taxes and debt.\n\nHe is baiting Republicans with $561 billion in defense spending to secure billions in additional spending for his neo \u201cGreat Society\u201d welfare and entitlement programs, coupled with the tax increases he\u2019s demanding on capital gains, corporations and death.\n\nNote the irony that defense spending, which is authorized by our Constitution, is classified as \u201cdiscretionary spending,\u201d while government benefits and entitlements, which make up about $2.5 trillion of this behemoth and are not authorized by our Constitution, are classified as \u201cmandatory spending.\u201d Through the looking glass we go!\n\nThe leftist site Politico lauded Obama\u2019s budget, noting he \u201cis lurching to the left. \u2026 Remember those budget caps [he] put in place in 2011? Obama wants to blast right through them. It\u2019s a progressive\u2019s dream version of Obama, untethered from earlier centrist leanings. The direction Obama is steering the party lines up much more closely with the politics of Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.\u201d Ah, yes, Elizabeth Warren, who most of the pundits have discounted as a 2016 political contender \u2013 but not yours truly.\n\nDemonstrating his mastery of deceptive diction, Obama justified his budget increases, claiming, \u201cI want to work with Congress to replace mindless austerity with smart investments. We can do so in a way that is fiscally responsible. [Insert uncontrollable laughter here] I\u2019m not going to accept a budget that locks in sequestration going forward. It would be bad for our security and bad for our growth. I will not accept a budget that severs the vital link between our national security and our economic security. [Insert more uncontrollable laughter here] Part of the reason why we grew faster last year was [that] we were no longer being burdened by mindless across-the-board cuts.\u201d\n\nFor the record, those \u201cmindless cuts\u201d were due to the 2011 Budget Control Act known as \u201csequestration,\u201d which Obama proposed. He used it then as an end-run around Republicans in budget negotiations, then he made the cuts \u201cmindless\u201d in implementation. And as for all the Democrat remonstrations that the sequester would be \u201cthe end of the world,\u201d according to a GAO report, only one federal employee lost a job due to sequestration.\n\nArguing for his so-called \u201cBlueprint for Middle-Class Economics\u201d in an editorial published in HuffPo (the only online repository that would publish such rubbish), Obama suggested, \u201cAmerica\u2019s resurgence is real. With a growing economy, shrinking deficits, bustling industry, and booming energy production, we have risen from recession freer to write our own future than any other nation on Earth.\u201d\n\nHuh? Perhaps on \u201cPlanet Obama.\u201d\n\nHe insisted, \u201cNow we have to choose what we want that future to look like.\u201d\n\nYes, as Thomas Jefferson wrote, \u201cWe must make our election between economy and liberty, or profusion and servitude.\u201d\n\nObama asks, \u201cWill we commit ourselves to an economy that generates rising incomes and rising chances for everyone who makes the effort?\u201d\n\nGood question, but, according to analysis by the liberal Tax Policy Center, Obama\u2019s proposals will \u201chave very little net impact on middle-income households.\u201d\n\nIn other words, his \u201cmiddle-class\u201d rhetoric is nothing more than, well, rhetoric. Not only will his proposals do little for middle-income earners in the near term, but they will crush them in the long term.\n\nAs for all his tax and spending increases, Obama claims, \u201cI\u2019m proposing we make the kinds of investments we need \u2026 these common-sense investments \u2026 invest in key national priorities \u2026 investments with equal dollar increases \u2026 investments in key areas\u2026\u201d\n\nAgain, he insists, \u201cWe can afford to make these investments while remaining fiscally responsible.\u201d\n\nSetting aside for the moment \u201cwhat we can afford\u201d given $18 trillion in national debt, understand that Obama\u2019s statist definition of \u201cinvestment\u201d is state-controlled wealth redistribution and spending, the antithesis of the free enterprise notion of investment that would truly ensure \u201cfiscal responsibility.\u201d\n\nAccording to economic analyst Jeffrey Dorfman, if you assume GDP is growing \u201cat about 3%, the economy is adding about $530 billion to GDP annually. \u2026 [Obama\u2019s $340 billion non-discretionary spending consumes] 65% of the new money available in the economy \u2026 Think of that as if the entire economy is facing a marginal tax rate of 67 percent.\u201d Bottom line: Our Constitution stipulates that only Congress has the authority to set the federal budget. So, now we\u2019ll see if the \u201cnew and improved\u201d Republican majorities will act according to their constitutional oaths. We\u2019ll see whether they\u2019re prepared to battle or to bow out.\n\nHere, deep in grassroots America far outside the Beltway, I would suggest the Republican majorities should completely ignore Obama\u2019s budget and take control of the debate \u2013 setting their own budget and making a strong fiscal and economic case for it.\n\nOn a positive note, Tuesday the House voted 239-186 on a measure to gut ObamaCare noting many reasons, not the least of which is the devastating financial impact the so-called \u201cAffordable Care Act\u201d is having on the \u201cmiddle-class economy,\u201d as outlined by my colleagues at The Heritage Foundation here and here.\n\nAdditionally, Ted Cruz (R-TX) has enlisted 44 co-sponsors to back his Senate bill to repeal ObamaCare, but that will be subject to a Democrat filibuster which would require Republican leaders to force a budget \u201creconciliation\u201d in order to get the bill to Obama\u2019s desk, where he would ceremonially veto it.\n\nBut Obama\u2019s refusal to accept that his signature \u201chealth care\u201d legislation is a colossal failure should not deter Congress from forcing his hand to veto. Likewise, Congress should be undeterred in forcing his hand on his ruinous budget proposals.\n\nPro Deo et Constitutione \u2013 Libertas aut Mors\n\nSemper Fortis Vigilate Paratus et Fidelis", "article_metadata": {"description": "Putting Obama's statist plunder into perspective.", "csrf-token": "yhscbB3mDpQ6Gfr9tBEfFanGFLUts9cSKaNWfSkYttQ=", "msapplication-TileColor": "#2b5797", "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "og": {"site_name": "The Patriot Post", "description": "Putting Obama\u2019s statist plunder into perspective.", "title": "BO's $4 TRILLION Budget Debacle", "url": "http://patriotpost.us/alexander/32898", "image": "http://assets.patriotpost.us/images/2015-02-04-b17db906.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100002378661032, "app_id": 217327155053459}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/mstile-144x144.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaba2\"", "article_summary": "Alexander's Column BO's $4 TRILLION Budget Debacle Will Majority Rs Battle or Bow Out?\nObama\u2019s \u201cmiddle-class economy\u201d debt load on the American people is hard to fathom.\nThe leftist site Politico lauded Obama\u2019s budget, noting he \u201cis lurching to the left.\nOur national debt is now $18.1 trillion \u2013 almost $8 trillion of that added by Obama in just the last six years.\nFact is, Obama is banking his budget on the backs of every American household, and the burden is growing heavier by the minute."}
