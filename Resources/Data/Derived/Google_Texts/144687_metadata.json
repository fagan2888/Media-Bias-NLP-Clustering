They ate, drank and discussed the future of global soccer.\n\nThe top leaders didn\u2019t want to speculate openly on the election, but many leaders feel the next president should show more respect to the billions of Euros coming out of this continent.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s undoubted that the weight of European football should be properly felt throughout the world,\u201d European Club Association vice chairman Umberto Gandini, an AC Milan director, told The Associated Press at the Berlin Ritz-Carlton. \u201cIt is fundamental for those who are risking investing their money in professional football in Europe have the opportunities to design the rules and regulations. We deserve to be there (at FIFA) because of what we represent.\u201d\n\nThe scandal so far has focused on bribes in the Americas and Africa. But behind the jokes and revelry, there was clearly a deep uncertainty about who could next be ensnared by the escalating corruption scandal. The other big question was who is best positioned to lead the world\u2019s biggest game out of this mess, with Sepp Blatter preparing to vacate a FIFA headquarters that has already been raided by Swiss police.\n\nEuropean soccer provides the most valuable viewing audience, the biggest clubs and the greatest players in the world \u2014 no matter where they were born. But FIFA gives each nation one vote, so tiny nations like the Cayman Islands have as much influence as world powers.\n\nAnd the 79-year-old Blatter has built a coalition of African and Asian nations, along with some tiny island territories and big outliers like Russia \u2014 the next World Cup host. Despite Blatter\u2019s resignation, if another candidate grabs that same coalition, the Europeans won\u2019t be able to change FIFA.\n\nA constant theme from Blatter to deflect Europe\u2019s grasp for more control has been to depict the clubs there as leeching off the rest of the world by pilfering the best players.\n\n\u201cThe perception is there\u2019s a neo-colonialism in world football,\u201d said Jerome Champagne, a Frenchman who served under Blatter as deputy secretary general. \u201cEuropean football is using African and South American talent but doesn\u2019t care about the leagues there losing their talent and losing their fan base. There is a lot of resentment from outside Europe.\u201d\n\nBlatter proved that his collation was still strong enough by winning a fifth term as FIFA president on May 29, only to announce four days later that the scandal had cost him too much support and that he would resign after new elections held at some point from December to March.\n\nEuropean chief Michel Platini, a former Blatter confidant turned adversary, is a favorite. But he\u2019ll need help from outside of his European power base.\n\nThe former France captain and coach is president of UEFA, overseeing the Champions League and its $1.1 billion prize pool. Saturday\u2019s game was the pinnacle of Platini\u2019s year, a gathering of elite players and coaches, blue chip sponsors and club and federation leaders.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Champions League highlights importance of Europe to FIFA", "title": "Champions League highlights importance of Europe to FIFA", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Champions League highlights importance of Europe to FIFA", "title": "Champions League highlights importance of Europe to FIFA", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/06/07/champions_league_highlights_importance_of_europe_to_fifa/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/germany-soccer-champions-league-final.jpeg25-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Champions League highlights importance of Europe to FIFA", "title": "Champions League highlights importance of Europe to FIFA", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/germany-soccer-champions-league-final.jpeg25-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Rob Harris", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd6311\"", "article_summary": "The former France captain and coach is president of UEFA, overseeing the Champions League and its $1.1 billion prize pool.\n\u201cIt\u2019s undoubted that the weight of European football should be properly felt throughout the world,\u201d European Club Association vice chairman Umberto Gandini, an AC Milan director, told The Associated Press at the Berlin Ritz-Carlton.\n\u201cThe perception is there\u2019s a neo-colonialism in world football,\u201d said Jerome Champagne, a Frenchman who served under Blatter as deputy secretary general.\n\u201cEuropean football is using African and South American talent but doesn\u2019t care about the leagues there losing their talent and losing their fan base.\nBut FIFA gives each nation one vote, so tiny nations like the Cayman Islands have as much influence as world powers."}
