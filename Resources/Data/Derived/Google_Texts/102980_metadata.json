The Modern Environmental Movement, a revolution in consciousness, is now celebrated every year on April 22, Earth Day, MEM\u2019s birthday.\n\nCome join the party. The happy news is we\u2019re all connected. What\u2019s good for the Earth is good for you.\n\nEarth Day 2016 marks 46 years of deep struggle and intermittent success when it comes to building \u201can environmental democracy\u201d that protects the planet as a whole and each of us individually.\n\nGranted, we have a disturbingly long way to go to protect and defend our air, water and food supplies, but back in 1970, environmental cleanup wasn\u2019t even a concept.\n\n\u201cEnvironment was a word that appeared more often in spelling bees than the evening news,\u201d the official Earth Day Network website, EarthDay.org, reminds us. \u201cAir pollution was commonly accepted as the smell of prosperity.\u201d\n\nThat was then. This is now. Now the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Endangered Species Act are all law \u2014 constantly threatened but increasingly relevant \u2014 and climate change is front and center.\n\nThis Earth Day 2016, more than 50,000 partner organizations in 196 countries \u2014 around 1.1 billion people \u2014 will be doing things to recognize the importance of creating a healthy, sustainable environment. That makes it the largest secular holiday in the world, and the Earth Day worldwide action plan now includes greening deteriorated schools, creating green jobs and investment, combating the rising rates of asthma and cancer, increasing funding for public parks and recreation, even getting out the vote.\n\nSo how will you and your dear ones celebrate this growing movement? Here are some down-to-Earth Day ideasn:\n\nPlant a tree. The EDN is calling for the planting of 7.8 billion trees by 2020, Earth Day\u2019s 50th year. This is where the expression \u201cnot in my backyard\u201d takes on new meaning. They suggest you plant four or five trees on your land, your neighbors\u2019 land or at a nearby park or business. (Check out the EDN website for more.)\n\nStart composting. More than a billion pounds of food are tossed into the garbage every year. You can make a difference by turning your food waste into healthy soil. Portion control is part of it. The Clean Plate Club wants you to take less on your plate and feel great when dinner\u2019s over.\n\nBe a biker. Ride to work, to school, to local stores. Not only are bikes easy on the environment; they are a great way to burn calories, build muscle and juice up your joints. It\u2019s a win-spin situation!\n\nEat less red meat. It\u2019s the cow farts, dear reader! The meat industry generates nearly one-fifth of the man-made greenhouse gas emissions worldwide. When meat consumption goes down, the health of the planet goes up, and your health improves, too, because most red meat is filled with nasty hormones and antibiotics.\n\nPlant a garden. Fresh food is the best food. If you\u2019re landless, find a community garden to play in. Get your kids to dig in, too. Research shows that getting kids involved in growing healthy food is a terrific way to get them involved in eating healthy food.\n\nLove your lungs. Limit your intake of poisons, toxins and chemicals coming from household cleaners, paints and finishes, furniture and flooring, etc. Also, be sure to exercise regularly, breathe mindfully and learn to make the most of the oxygen you do have.\n\nBuy local produce. When you shop at farmers markets and support local growers and breeders, you get a double whammy of benefit. You will eat healthier and reduce your carbon footprint.\n\nRecycle your e-waste. This Earth Day, open every drawer and closet, collect all your old, unused electronic devices, and get rid of them (responsibly, of course).\n\nBe the change you want to see. Our planet is in peril. Your health is at stake. Do what you can, because no one else can do it for", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2016/04/Preston20101.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1bf1\"", "article_summary": "Research shows that getting kids involved in growing healthy food is a terrific way to get them involved in eating healthy food.\n\u201cEnvironment was a word that appeared more often in spelling bees than the evening news,\u201d the official Earth Day Network website, EarthDay.org, reminds us.\nThis Earth Day, open every drawer and closet, collect all your old, unused electronic devices, and get rid of them (responsibly, of course).\nThe Modern Environmental Movement, a revolution in consciousness, is now celebrated every year on April 22, Earth Day, MEM\u2019s birthday.\nThis Earth Day 2016, more than 50,000 partner organizations in 196 countries \u2014 around 1.1 billion people \u2014 will be doing things to recognize the importance of creating a healthy, sustainable environment."}
