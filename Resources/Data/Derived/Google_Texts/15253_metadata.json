Most file 1099s rather than W2s, for tax purposes.\n\nOn demand and on call \u2013 in the \u201cshare\u201d economy, the \u201cgig\u201d economy, or, more prosaically, the \u201cirregular\u201d economy \u2013 the result is the same: no predictable earnings or hours.\n\nAdvertisement Square, Site wide\n\nIt\u2019s the biggest change in the American workforce in over a century, and it\u2019s happening at lightning speed. It\u2019s estimated that in five years over 40 percent of the American labor force will have uncertain work; in a decade, most of us.\n\n\n\nIncreasingly, businesses need only a relatively small pool of \u201ctalent\u201d anchored in the enterprise \u2013 innovators and strategists responsible for the firm\u2019s unique competitive strength.\n\nEveryone else is becoming fungible, sought only for their reliability and low cost.\n\nComplex algorithms can now determine who\u2019s needed to do what and when, and then measure the quality of what\u2019s produced. Reliability can be measured in experience ratings. Software can seamlessly handle all transactions \u2013 contracts, billing, payments, taxes.\n\nAll this allows businesses to be highly nimble \u2013 immediately responsive to changes in consumer preferences, overall demand, and technologies.\n\nWhile shifting all the risks of such changes to workers.\n\n\n\nWhether we\u2019re software programmers, journalists, Uber drivers, stenographers, child care workers, TaskRabbits, beauticians, plumbers, Airbnb\u2019rs, adjunct professors, or contract nurses \u2013 increasingly, we\u2019re on our own.\n\nAnd what we\u2019re paid, here and now, depends on what we\u2019re worth here and now \u2013 in a spot-auction market that\u2019s rapidly substituting for the old labor market where people held jobs that paid regular salaries and wages.\n\nEven giant corporations are devolving into spot-auction networks. Amazon\u2019s algorithms evaluate and pay workers for exactly what they contribute.\n\nApple directly employs fewer than 10 percent of the 1 million workers who design, make and sell iMacs and iPhones.\n\nThis giant risk-shift doesn\u2019t necessarily mean lower pay. Contract workers typically make around $18 an hour, comparable to what they earned as \u201cemployees.\u201d\n\n\n\nUber and other ride-share drivers earn around $25 per hour, more than double what the typical taxi driver takes home.\n\nThe problem is workers don\u2019t know when they\u2019ll earn it. A downturn in demand, or sudden change in consumer needs, or a personal injury or sickness, can make it impossible to pay the bills.\n\nSo they have to take whatever they can get, now: ride-shares in mornings and evenings, temp jobs on weekdays, freelance projects on weekends, Mechanical Turk or TaskRabbit tasks in between.\n\nWhich partly explains why Americans are putting in such long work hours \u2013 longer than in any other advanced economy.\n\nAnd why we\u2019re so stressed. According to polls, almost a quarter of American workers worry they won\u2019t be earning enough in the future. That\u2019s up from 15 percent a decade ago.\n\nIrregular hours can also take a mental toll. Studies show people who do irregular work for a decade suffer an average cognitive decline of 6.5 years relative people with regular hours.\n\nSuch uncertainty can be hard on families, too. Children of parents working unpredictable schedules or outside standard daytime working hours are likely to have lower cognitive skills and more behavioral problems, according to new research.\n\nFor all these reasons, the upsurge in uncertain work makes the old economic measures \u2013 unemployment and income \u2013 look far better than Americans actually feel.\n\nIt also renders irrelevant many labor protections such as the minimum wage, worker safety, family and medical leave, and overtime \u2013 because there\u2019s no clear \u201cemployer.\u201d\n\nAnd for the same reason eliminates employer-financed insurance \u2013 Social Security, workers compensation, unemployment benefits, and employer-provided health insurance under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nWhat to do? Courts are overflowing with lawsuits over whether companies have misclassified \u201cemployees\u201d as \u201cindependent contractors,\u201d resulting in a profusion of criteria and definitions.\n\nWe should aim instead for simplicity: Whatever party \u2013 contractor, client, customer, agent, or intermediary \u2013 pays more than half of someone\u2019s income, or provides more than half their working hours, should be responsible for all the labor protections and insurance an employee is entitled to.\n\nPresumably that party will share those costs and risks with its own clients, customers, owners, and investors. Which is the real point \u2013 to take these risks off the backs of individuals and spread them as widely as possible.\n\nIn addition, to restore some certainty to peoples\u2019 lives, we\u2019ll need to move away from unemployment insurance and toward income insurance.\n\nSay, for example, your monthly income dips more than 50 percent below the average monthly income you\u2019ve received from all the jobs you\u2019ve taken over the preceding five years. Under one form of income insurance, you\u2019d automatically receive half the difference for up to a year.\n\nBut that\u2019s not all. Ultimately, we\u2019ll need a guaranteed minimum basic income. But I\u2019ll save this for another column.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "business, economy, free agents, freelancers, independent contractors, labor, labor day, part-timers, politics, robert reich, self-employed, temporary workers, uncertain work, work, workers rights", "og": {"site_name": "Truthdig", "description": "As Labor Day looms, more Americans than ever don\u2019t know how much they\u2019ll be earning next week or even tomorrow.\n - 2015/08/27", "title": "Upsurge in Uncertainty About Work Income: Robert Reich", "url": "http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/the_upsurge_in_uncertain_work_20150827", "image": {"width": 360, "identifier": "http://www.truthdig.com/images/eartothegrounduploads/worksworks_360.jpg", "height": 254}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "As Labor Day looms, more Americans than ever don\u2019t know how much they\u2019ll be earning next week or even tomorrow.", "title": "Upsurge in Uncertainty About Work Income | Truthdig: Drilling Beneath the Headlines", "url": "http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/the_upsurge_in_uncertain_work_20150827/", "image": {"width": 360, "identifier": "http://www.truthdig.com/images/eartothegrounduploads/worksworks_360.jpg", "height": 254}, "creator": "@truthdig", "site": "@truthdig"}, "fb": {"app_id": 319814091404244}, "keywords": "Truthdig, Upsurge in Uncertainty About Work Income, business, economy, free agents, freelancers, independent contractors, labor, labor day, part-timers, politics, robert reich, self-employed, temporary workers, uncertain work, work, workers rights", "article": {"tag": "business, economy, free agents, freelancers, independent contractors, labor, labor day, part-timers, politics, robert reich, self-employed, temporary workers, uncertain work, work, workers rights", "published_time": "2015-08-27T02:14:50-08:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-28T11:32:51-08:00"}, "description": "As Labor Day looms, more Americans than ever don\u2019t know how much they\u2019ll be earning next week or even tomorrow.\n - 2015/08/27"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca1b2\"", "article_summary": "In addition, to restore some certainty to peoples\u2019 lives, we\u2019ll need to move away from unemployment insurance and toward income insurance.\nUnder one form of income insurance, you\u2019d automatically receive half the difference for up to a year.\nWhich partly explains why Americans are putting in such long work hours \u2013 longer than in any other advanced economy.\nFor all these reasons, the upsurge in uncertain work makes the old economic measures \u2013 unemployment and income \u2013 look far better than Americans actually feel.\nChildren of parents working unpredictable schedules or outside standard daytime working hours are likely to have lower cognitive skills and more behavioral problems, according to new research."}
