ABOARD THE CHARLES DE GAULLE (AP) — The chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff says some Iraqi army units in line for U.S.-led training to fight the Islamic State group are showing up ill-prepared.

Gen. Martin Dempsey spoke to reporters Sunday aboard a French aircraft carrier in the northern Persian Gulf, not far from Iran’s coast.

He said he sees no reason to send more U.S. trainers or advisers to Iraq now. And more broadly, he defended the pace of the military campaign.

Dempsey said the advisers now on the ground in Iraq sometimes have to wait for Iraqi army units to show up for training, And he said some units that show up are “understrength and sometimes without the proper equipment.”

He said this is a problem the Iraqi government can fix.
