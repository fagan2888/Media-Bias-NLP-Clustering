However, many of these studies suffer from the same flaw: They ignore or minimize the fact that, due to Obamacare, individuals will be forced to buy levels of health insurance that they may not need or want. As a result, average insurance premiums on the individual health insurance market will rise significantly in most states.\n\nApples and Oranges\n\nIn its recent issue brief estimating exchange premiums for 2014, the Kaiser Family Foundation noted many new changes in insurance regulation taking effect next year due to Obamacare. For instance, new requirements regarding \u201cessential health benefits\u201d will expand the breadth of insurance offerings\u2014requiring plans to cover additional categories of treatments, such as habilitative services\u2014while new requirements regarding actuarial value will expand insurance plans\u2019 depth\u2014that is, the percentage of expected health expenses covered by health insurance. The Kaiser brief argued:\n\nThese [and other] changes make direct comparisons of exchange premiums and existing individual market premiums complicated.\u2026 Therefore, we do not attempt to compare the exchange premiums to existing market rates in this report.[1]\n\nAs a result, rather than comparing next year\u2019s premium projections with existing rates, the Kaiser brief focused on the point that early premium projections in some states may be below prior Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates.[2]\n\nHowever, such statements ignore a key element that then-Senator Barack Obama used during his presidential campaign to sell people on his health care plan:\n\nFor those who have insurance now, nothing will change under the Obama plan\u2014except that you will pay less. Obama\u2019s plan will save a typical family up to $2,500 on premiums by bringing the health care system into the 21st century.[3]\n\nCandidate Obama did not promise that \u201cyou will pay more for insurance, but you will get a better health plan in return.\u201d He explicitly promised that \u201cyou will pay less.\u201d And by refusing to compare existing premiums to the higher rates individuals will face on exchanges next year, the Kaiser study avoids facing this clear broken promise.\n\nMandates Raising Premiums\n\nA report by the Rand Corporation, requested and funded by the Department of Health and Human Services, estimated \u201ca 22 percent increase in average premiums\u201d due to Obamacare next year, \u201cwith several states experiencing an increase of 30 percent or more.\u201d[4]\n\nHowever, the report went on to argue that \u201caverage premium increases can be very misleading because they do not adjust for changes in benefit generosity (measured by actuarial value)\u201d and other factors. After adjusting for those factors, Rand concluded that \u201cthere could be a decline in total premiums for the United States\u201d[5]\u2014and it was this conclusion that drew the greatest amount of press attention.[6]\n\nHowever, the Rand study\u2019s conclusion that, after adjusting for actuarial value, premiums will not increase under Obamacare next year misses the point. Premiums will increase next year precisely because Obamacare requires an increase in actuarial value.\n\nA study in Health Affairs from May 2012 found that most insurance plans purchased by individuals did not meet Obamacare\u2019s actuarial value requirements.[7] The article\u2019s title makes the point clear: \u201cMore Than Half of Individual Health Plans Offer Coverage That Falls Short of What Can Be Sold Through Exchanges as of 2014.\u201d Because Obamacare requires most exchange plans to carry an actuarial value\u2014that is, the percentage of expected health expenses covered by insurance\u2014of at least 60 percent, those individuals currently in plans that do not meet the requirement will have to purchase richer coverage beginning next year, thus raising their premiums.\n\nWhen analyzing Obamacare premiums in 2009, the CBO agreed that the law\u2019s mandated benefits would raise health insurance premiums:\n\nAverage premiums [under Obamacare] would be 27 percent to 30 percent higher because a greater amount of coverage would be obtained. In particular, the average insurance policy in this market would cover a substantially larger share of enrollees\u2019 costs for health care (on average) and a slightly wider range of benefits. Those expansions would reflect both the minimum level of coverage (and related requirements) specified in the proposal and people\u2019s decisions to purchase more extensive coverage in response to the structure of subsidies.[8]\n\nThe CBO notes that the \u201cminimum level of coverage\u201d prescribed in the law will result in insurance covering \u201ca substantially larger share of enrollees\u2019 costs for health care\u201d\u2014exactly the changes in actuarial value that the Rand study ignores.\n\nThe Rand study contains other methodological flaws. It assumes, for instance, that \u201call smokers\u201d will face surcharges for tobacco usage,[9] even though a recent \u201ccomputer glitch\u201d means insurers will not be able to impose the full tobacco surcharge for \u201cat least a year.\u201d[10] And the Rand model also does \u201cnot allow for the possibility that firms might reduce worker hours or change size in response to\u201d Obamacare[11]\u2014even though many firms have been doing just that.[12] However, the study\u2019s biggest shortcoming is its lack of discussion of the mandates in Obamacare, particularly the actuarial value requirements, that will raise premiums for many Americans.\n\nStop Obamacare\n\nEven before all state exchanges release their premium data, the evidence is clear: Overall, Obamacare\u2019s benefit mandates will raise premiums, not lower them\u2014and candidate Obama\u2019s promise to lower rates by $2,500 per family amounts to a massive broken promise. For these reasons and more, Congress should use its \u201cpower of the purse\u201d to stop Obamacare before these new costly mandates take effect on January 1.\n\n\u2014Chris Jacobs is Senior Policy Analyst in the Center for Health Policy Studies at The Heritage Foundation.\n\nAbout the Author Chris Jacobs Senior Policy Analyst\n\nCenter for Health Policy Studies", "article_metadata": {"description": "Overall, Obamacare\u2019s benefit mandates will raise premiums, not lower them.", "og": {"site_name": "The Heritage Foundation", "description": "Overall, Obamacare\u2019s benefit mandates will raise premiums, not lower them.", "title": "Interpreting Obamacare\u2019s Premium Estimates for 2014", "url": "http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2013/09/projecting-premiums-in-obamacare-s-health-care-exchanges", "image": "http://www.heritage.org/~/media/heritage.ashx", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@heritage", "card": "summary", "creator": "@heritage"}, "robots": "NOODP", "keywords": "Obamacare, health care, premiums, exchanges, insurance, health benefits", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/heritagefoundation"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf16f\"", "article_summary": "As a result, average insurance premiums on the individual health insurance market will rise significantly in most states.\nInterpreting Obamacare\u2019s Premium Estimates for 2014About the Author Chris Jacobs Senior Policy AnalystCenter for Health Policy StudiesIn recent weeks, several organizations have released studies projecting premiums in Obamacare\u2019s new exchanges next year.\n\u2014Chris Jacobs is Senior Policy Analyst in the Center for Health Policy Studies at The Heritage Foundation.\nAbout the Author Chris Jacobs Senior Policy AnalystCenter for Health Policy Studies\nA study in Health Affairs from May 2012 found that most insurance plans purchased by individuals did not meet Obamacare\u2019s actuarial value requirements."}
