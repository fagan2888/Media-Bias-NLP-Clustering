This shift creates a tremendous opportunity to apply analytics to improve outcomes and reduce costs.\n\nDespite this promise, it is important to remember that analytics initiatives in other industries are known to have a high failure rate. What\u2019s needed is not more data or reports, but meaningful and actionable insights to drive change. Consider this four-step approach, called Analytic Pathways, which grounds analytical work in a strategic perspective, and provides structure to an inherently exploratory and iterative process.\n\nStep 1. Frame a Powerful Question: The first, and most important, step is to clarify the problem you are trying to solve. In order to leverage the power of analytics, broad business issues must be translated to a set of specific questions that can be explored quantitatively.\n\nThis is easier said than done. To help get started, it\u2019s useful to develop a high-level Key Performance Indicator scorecard of metrics related to a high-level strategic question. For example, if you are evaluating strategies to refine benefit design for spouses, your scorecard could compare risk, cost, and utilization metrics of spouses compared to employees.\n\nStep 2. Identify Key Drivers: Once you\u2019ve framed the key question for the analysis, the next step is to understand where the problem lies. Is it driven by a particular conditions, or types of procedures? Is it concentrated in certain locations or plan types? Step two centers on slicing the data in different ways to reveal a small set of factors that have a disproportionate influence on the question.\n\nFocus your analysis on understanding the causes of absolute differences in \u201crated metrics,\u201d like per-member-per-month (PMPM) costs, or admission rates. For example, consider the breakdown of inpatient admissions below. Many analysts would gravitate towards the 23 percent increase in behavioral health admissions. However, looking at the absolute differences shows that the 13 percent increase in medical admissions is the most important driver, accounting for just over half of the total increase in the population\u2019s admission rate.\n\nAdmission Type Last Year This Year % Change Absolute\n\nDifference % of Total Difference Medical 31.0 35.0 13% 4.0 51% Surgical 21.2 23.4 10% 2.2 28% Maternity 11.0 12.0 9% 1.0 13% Behavioral Health 2.2 2.7 23% 0.5 6% Non-Acute 4.4 4.5 2% 0.1 1% Total 69.8 77.6 11% 7.8 100%", "article_metadata": {"com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages04.net,assistedhousingfinancialinsider.com,assistedhousinginsider.com,commercialleaselawinsider.com,constructionsuperconference.com,efaconference.com,secure.rhq.com,secure2.rhq.com,www.addictionpro.com,www.apartmentlawinsider.com,www.assistedhousinginsider.com,www.behavioral.net,www.commercialleaselawinsider.com,www.commercialtenantsleaseinsider.com,www.communityassociationinsider.com,www.constructionsuperconference.com,www.entjournal.com,www.environmentsforaging.com,www.etouches.com,www.fairhousingcoach.com,www.hcd11.com,www.healthcare-informatics.com,www.healthcarebuildingideas.com,www.healthcaredesignmagazine.com,www.herdjournal.com,www.ihealthtran.com,www.landlordvtenant.com,www.ltlmagazine.com,www.nycapartmentlaw.com,www.taxcredithousinginsider.com,www.vendomegrp.com,www.vendomerealestatemedia.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "com.silverpop.cothost": "engage4.silverpop.com"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd72bb\"", "article_summary": "Frame a Powerful Question: The first, and most important, step is to clarify the problem you are trying to solve.\nMany analysts would gravitate towards the 23 percent increase in behavioral health admissions.\nIdentify Key Drivers: Once you\u2019ve framed the key question for the analysis, the next step is to understand where the problem lies.\nHowever, looking at the absolute differences shows that the 13 percent increase in medical admissions is the most important driver, accounting for just over half of the total increase in the population\u2019s admission rate.\nConsider this four-step approach, called Analytic Pathways, which grounds analytical work in a strategic perspective, and provides structure to an inherently exploratory and iterative process."}
