FRUSTRATING TREASURY NOT ENOUGH Litvak had been free on bail while he appealed his March 2014 conviction and two-year prison term. Prosecutors said Litvak misled customers, including participants in TARP's Public-Private Investment Program, about bond prices from 2009 to 2011, helping Jefferies boost profit by $2.25 million and his own pay, which he thought too low. In voiding the TARP fraud conviction, Straub found a lack of evidence that Litvak's conduct was \"reasonably capable of influencing a decision of the Treasury,\" even if it was relevant to that agency and frustrated its investment goals. He also said Chief Judge Janet Hall of the New Haven, Connecticut, federal court, who oversaw Litvak's trial, erred in excluding testimony from Ram Willner, a portfolio manager. Willner was to testify that investors who negotiate with bond traders like Litvak would widely consider statements from such traders \"biased\" and often misleading. Straub said excluding Willner's testimony was unfair to Litvak by making it too hard to rebut testimony that his misstatements mattered to investors with whom he dealt. Jefferies, a unit of Leucadia National Corp , in March 2014 entered a non-prosecution agreement and agreed to pay $25 million to end U.S. probes of its supervision of Litvak and other traders. Marc Mukasey, a lawyer for former Nomura trader Gramins, said: \"The government's case has been gutted by the Second Circuit. It's heartening to know that the rule of law still prevails in these days of government overreach.\" Lawyers for the other Nomura defendants did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Richard Albert, a lawyer for Katke, said he is reviewing the decision. The case is Litvak v. U.S., 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 14-2902.
