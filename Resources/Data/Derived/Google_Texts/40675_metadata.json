Supporters of Initiative 42 say that is not their intention. They said the proposal is designed to force the Legislature to undertake a program to phase-in full funding over a period of years for the local school districts that have been underfunded about $1.7 billion since 2008.\n\nBoth Eaton and Ford said community colleges also are in dire need of additional funding, but they would not fight Initiative 42.\n\n\u201cFrom ICC\u2019s standpoint, we are staying out of that, taking no position,\u201d Eaton said.\n\n\u201cI got friends on both sides,\u201d Ford said. \u201c\u2026 I fully support K-12 education.\u201d\n\nEaton said his wish is that if Initiative 42 passes, state leaders then would look at the law that mandates community colleges be funded at the mid-level between universities and K-12 education and also undertake that effort. The Legislature also has not met that state-law mandate.\n\nSmith\u2019s email comes soon after state Auditor Stacey Pickering, after complaints from some of the legislative leadership who oppose Initiative 42, warned local school districts not to inappropriately campaign for the proposal.\n\nAs if turn about is fair play, a news release from 42 For Better Schools, which supports the effort to change the Mississippi Constitution to enhance the state\u2019s commitment to public education, said a complaint of Smith\u2019s actions has been filed with the state auditor\u2019s office.\n\nIn the news release, Rayna Mitchell, assistant superintendent for the Carroll County School District, who filed the complaint, pointed out the Smith email said the Improve Mississippi Political Initiative, for which he was raising funds, was started by Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves and Speaker Philip Gunn.\n\n\u201cThis is yet another blatant example of our elected state leaders misappropriating state resources to defeat a citizen-led initiative,\u201d Mitchell said.\n\nIt is not clear why Smith, who could not be reached for comment, listed Gunn and Reeves as the creators of the political action committee. They are not listed in the documents forming the Improve Mississippi Political Committee, though, various sources say both have been raising funds to oppose the citizen-sponsored initiative.\n\nThe email by Smith also comes after the refusal of both Gunn and Reeves to release their email correspondence related to Initiative 42, citing the fact the Legislature is exempt from the state\u2019s public records laws.\n\nBoth Reeves and Gunn said they did not ask Smith to send out the email.\n\nMeg Annison, a House spokeswoman, said the House leaders did not know about the Smith email until it was brought to their attention by the media.\n\nLaura Hipp, a spokeswoman for Reeves, also said the lieutenant governor did not know about the email, though she said he \u201cencourages all who have concerns with Initiative 42 to voice those concerns.\u201d\n\nBut Auditor Pickering has said, based on state law, governmental officials must be careful how they voice those concerns.\n\nIn a statement, Pickering said, \u201cWe have received numerous complaints concerning education officials using public resources to advocate for and against Initiative 42. We have communicated to them Attorney General Jim Hood\u2019s opinion and applicable state law that says it is appropriate to educate their constituents, but it does not allow them to advocate, pro or con, on any issue, but specifically as it relates to Initiative 42.\u201d\n\nNancy Loome, the executive director of the pro-Initiative 42 Parents Campaign, sent out an email Friday informing K-12 educators that under state law they could express support for the proposal, but could not use public funds to do so.\n\nShe said state law also prohibits governmental officials with the power to hire and fire people \u201cto coerce employees to vote one way or another. \u2026 I know this is exactly what state legislative leaders are urging state agency heads to do, but it\u2019s illegal.\u201d\n\nbobby.harrison@journalinc.com\n\nTwitter: @BobbyHarrison9", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal", "description": "By Bobby Harrison Daily Journal Jackson Bureau JACKSON \u2013 Presidents of Northeast Mississippi Community College and Itawamba Community College say they are not going to get involved in the effort to defeat the citizen-sponsored Initiative 42, which is designed to enhance the state\u2019s commitment to kindergarten through 12th-grade public education.
