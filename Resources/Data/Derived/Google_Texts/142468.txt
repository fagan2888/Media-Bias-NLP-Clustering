ISLAMABAD (AP) â€” A militant video purports to show Taliban fighters with a surface-to-air missile, claiming they used a similar one to shoot down a Pakistani helicopter carrying diplomats.

The video, obtained by The Associated Press, includes a message from the Pakistani Taliban claiming they fired a missile from a distance of 3 kilometers (1.9 miles) to down the helicopter Friday.

The crash killed the ambassadors to Pakistan from the Philippines and Norway and the wives of the ambassadors from Malaysia and Indonesia, as well as three Pakistani crew members.

Pakistan says a technical failure caused the crash and dismissed an earlier Taliban claim they shot down the helicopter as opportunistic. However, the surface-to-air missile shown in the video appeared real.

Military officials could not be immediately reached Sunday to discuss the video.
