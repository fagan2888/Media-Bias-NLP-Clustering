South Carolina Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy promised his party is “going to respond” to President Obama’s pledge to use executive orders to work around congressional opposition, saying they would use the “power of the purse” to cut funding for the White House’s pet projects.

Gowdy spoke with Fox News’ Jeanine Pirro about the president’s use of executive orders to change and delay parts of Obamacare and otherwise change legislation without congressional input. The congressman expressed an unwillingness to wait around for judges to rule in Congress’ favor.

“We have appropriations bills that are going to be coming through the House this spring,” he said. “We oughta strip money away from this executive branch, because our Framers gave us that exclusive right to do so. If one branch overreaches, then maybe the other branch ought to stick up for itself!”

“Mr. President, you want to run roughshod over the Constitution? We have the power of the purse. We’re not gonna fund your pet projects!” he said later. “We’re not gonna fund your green energy initiatives! We’re not gonna fund your vacations!”

“There are a host of my colleagues that are not just going to sit around and mope and cry because this president overreaches,” he promised. “We’re going to respond! And we’re going to respond in the appropriations process.”
