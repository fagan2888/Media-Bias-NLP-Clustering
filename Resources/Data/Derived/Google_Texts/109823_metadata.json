He sits in a Broadway theater. On the stage, the actors ply their craft.\n\nIn this particular scene, two women and a man sit at a dinner table. Upon the table sits an almost-consumed meal and a birthday cake. The three engage in conversation until the discussion results in an insult, at which point the man erupts into a display of anger.\n\nSo skilled is the actor and so explosive is the eruption that the serviceman springs from his chair on the aisle and rushes the stage. So engulfed was he in what was taking place that he lost sight of the fact that he was seeing a play performed by actors. So riveting was the brutish performance that he thought the women on the stage were in danger and attempted to rush to their aid.\n\nFortunately, he came to the realization of where he was before reaching the stage and he returned to his seat. The young serviceman was my father, Norbert. The play was \u201cA Streetcar Named Desire\u201d and the actor was Marlon Brando.\n\nI\u2019ve seen many live plays and other performances, some of which involved celebrities that many of you would recognize. I\u2019ve even been moved to tears by some performances. But I don\u2019t think anything I\u2019ve experienced would compare to the emotions that Brando evoked from my father that day.\n\nIt was in the late 1930s that a woman recalls that, as a young girl, she was taken to her first professional baseball game in old Comiskey Park in Chicago by one of her older brothers. In the excitement of being in a professional ballpark and at her first game, she waves at a player as he approaches the dugout near which she sits. The player, who\u2019s from the opposing team, smiles and waves back.\n\nIn his next at-bat, he hits a towering home run \u2014 one of the 30 home runs the player would hit that year. The young girl was my mother, Sallee. The player was Joe DiMaggio.\n\nJust like in the earlier instance, I\u2019ve had the opportunity to witness many sporting events. I\u2019ve seen performances by several professional athletes that can legitimately be described as superstars, yet I don\u2019t look at those performances as being significant when compared to that summer day when my mother witnessed a performance by a true sports legend.\n\nOver the years, I\u2019ve also come into contact with more than a handful of politicians, both on a local and on a national level. I even had the opportunity to witness an address by a sitting president. I\u2019ve found these meetings and events to be interesting and engaging.\n\nI find it interesting to interact with people who have a hand in shaping our world, even in a small way, yet these interactions seem insignificant when I\u2019m reminded of a story I\u2019ve been told.\n\nIt was approximately 1915 and a young woman had left her home in Poland to study in Russia. She was attending what was at time the time called secondary school, the equivalent of what we would call a college today. This was very rare for women in that era.\n\nOne day, a parade took place in the city in which she was residing and studying. She and several of her schoolmates attended. In the parade was a man on horseback, a giant white steed. The man was adorned in ribbons and plumes. The horse\u2019s bridle and saddle appeared to be studded with jewels.\n\nThe young woman watched as the horse and rider pranced within a few feet of her. As he passed, he looked in her direction. When the procession continued beyond her, the young lady may not have realized that she had just been in the presence of a historic figure.\n\nThe young lady was my grandmother, Halina, and the rider on horseback was Tsar Nicholas II, emperor of Russia.\n\n\u2014 Bob Kowalczyk is a Manawa resident.
