She founded Teachers Rally Against Georgia Insurance Charges, or TRAGIC, as a protest against the State Health Benefit Plan insurance options that took effect Jan. 1.\n\nCline, the wife of a Cherokee County teacher, probably won\u2019t be getting lunch invitations or Christmas cards from Gov. Nathan Deal now either. That\u2019s because the first request she\u2019s made of her new friends is to flood his office with phone calls complaining about the insurance plan that covers teachers, state workers and retirees.\n\nIn an election year, that could send 650,000 votes to Deal\u2019s opponents. That\u2019s how many people are covered in the plan.\n\nHer main complaint and that of her growing membership is that they no longer have the option of a health maintenance organization in favor of a type of coinsurance where the patient pays along with the insurance. In the HMO, she was able to take her 4-year-old daughter Avery to occupational therapy and only have to pay $25 per weekly visit. Now, she must pay the full $130 until she has met Avery\u2019s yearly deductible of $1,500 before the new health reimbursement arrangement plan, or HRA, begins paying the majority of the costs.\n\nHer monthly premiums were $420, but now they are $540. As jolting as the 29-percent premium increase was, she would have gladly accepted an even higher premium to stay in the HMO and avoid deductibles.\n\n\u201cEvery single person I\u2019ve talked to who had the HMO said they would have paid more,\u201d she said.\n\nThe HMO plan was popular, with two of every five people covered by the State Health Benefit Plan were enrolled in the HMO. Its premiums have been climbing, and Cline only paid $147 per month for it in 2007.\n\nBy 2011, the HMO as well as the HRA and a high-deductible health plan, together were headed toward an $800 million deficit.\n\nThat prompted a quest for alternatives by the board of gubernatorial appointees overseeing the Department of Community Health that runs the program.\n\nWhen the board voted last August to eliminate the HMO option, it did because state employees and teachers were crying out for relief from soaring premiums at a time when their pay was frozen, according to Lisa Marie Shekell, the department\u2019s communications director.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that we had continuously heard from our members \u2014 particularly as they had furloughs and no pay raises \u2014 and the board was figuring, how can we respond to people asking how can you contain my premium level or maintain it,\u201d she said.\n\nFor Melissa McCoy, a 34-year-old English teacher who\u2019s suffered from malignant hypertension since her teens, the annual cost of just one of the many drugs she has to take would satisfy her yearly maximum out-of-pocket expense.\n\n\u201cI understand the concept of coinsurance. But what I do not understand is how a teacher in the state of Georgia is supposed to have $1,100 to spend on a stress test/echocardiogram in February,\u201d she wrote to the editors of the Savannah Morning News.\n\nAs for the governor, he was quoted in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution pointing the finger at the insurance administrator that lost the business to Blue Cross, United Healthcare which is suing the state over it.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s the genesis of it, and in some cases people have been given false information,\u201d Deal said.\n\nHis communications director, Brian Robinson, points toward the Obama administration for the coverage requirements of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cA lot of this is because the mandates of ACA are taking place and impacting the State Health Benefit Plan, definitely, and the governor is as concerned about it as teachers are,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you are upset about what\u2019s happened to your healthcare plan, it\u2019s not the Governor\u2019s Office where you should call. It\u2019s the White House.\u201d\n\nRobinson began his response by pointing out that it was Deal\u2019s appointees on the DCH board, not the governor himself, making the specific policy decisions.\n\nAt DCH, Shekell said the meetings, flyers and websites given to employees during last year\u2019s open-enrollment period didn\u2019t get through to some people.\n\n\u201cThe silver lining of what\u2019s come out is more people are contacting us, asking questions,\u201d she said, allowing the department to suggest ways to economize on prescriptions or lifestyle changes.\n\nShe\u2019s looking ahead, too.\n\n\u201cCertainly, we\u2019re receiving feedback from members -- just as we always have,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at what we\u2019ll be doing in 2015.\u201d\n\nAnd for Ashely Cline, she can\u2019t understand why no one saw this coming.\n\n\u201cIf a regular person can make a Facebook page and have it explode with all of these responses of people who said they\u2019re not going to be able to go to the doctor ... DCH should have anticipated some of this.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"geo.position": "32.083541;-81.099834", "news_keywords": "savannah, georgia, news press, hilton head, south carolina, newspaper, historic district, classifieds, savannah morning news, news, entertainment, local businesses, shopping, midnight, mci heritage, st. patricks day, city guide, savannah area resources", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rights": "Copyright Savannah Morning News, Morris Publishing Group", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/profiles/msms/themes/published/device-icons/widetile.png", "twitter": {"url": "http://savannahnow.com/news/2014-01-19/teachers-state-workers-are-upset-about-changes-health-plan", "creator": {"identifier": "@savannahnow", "id": 9164672}, "description": "ATLANTA \u2014 In 15 days, Ashley Cline has suddenly acquired nearly 9,000 new friends because of one thing they have in common.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Teachers, state workers are upset about changes in health plan"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/profiles/msms/themes/published/device-icons/smalltile.png", "robots": "value", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/profiles/msms/themes/published/device-icons/largetile.png", "og": {"url": "http://savannahnow.com/news/2014-01-19/teachers-state-workers-are-upset-about-changes-health-plan", "type": "article", "title": "Teachers, state workers are upset about changes in health plan", "site_name": "savannahnow.com", "updated_time": "2014-01-20T12:54:49-05:00"}, "MobileOptimized": "width", "__sync_contentCategory": "metered", "keywords": "savannah, georgia, news press, hilton head, south carolina, newspaper, historic district, classifieds, savannah morning news, news, entertainment, local businesses, shopping, midnight, mci heritage, st. patricks day, city guide, savannah area resources", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/profiles/msms/themes/published/device-icons/mediumtile.png", "fb": {"app_id": 1575785529334435}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfc09\"", "article_summary": "The HMO plan was popular, with two of every five people covered by the State Health Benefit Plan were enrolled in the HMO.\nShe founded Teachers Rally Against Georgia Insurance Charges, or TRAGIC, as a protest against the State Health Benefit Plan insurance options that took effect Jan. 1.\nThat\u2019s because the first request she\u2019s made of her new friends is to flood his office with phone calls complaining about the insurance plan that covers teachers, state workers and retirees.\nBy 2011, the HMO as well as the HRA and a high-deductible health plan, together were headed toward an $800 million deficit.\n\u201cA lot of this is because the mandates of ACA are taking place and impacting the State Health Benefit Plan, definitely, and the governor is as concerned about it as teachers are,\u201d he said."}
