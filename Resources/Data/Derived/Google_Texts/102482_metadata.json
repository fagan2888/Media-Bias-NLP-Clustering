But in many respects, the U.S. is an outlier among major global economies. Europe, China, Japan, and Russia are all experiencing weak or negative growth, which will eventually have an impact on U.S. growth.\n\nThe concern is less that other major economies are stuck in the doldrums will bring the U.S. into recession with them, but that they will hamper what could otherwise be a very strong U.S. economic recovery.\n\nWHY THIS MATTERS\n\n\n\nThe U.S. economy finally feels as though it is on strong footing, but without strong trading partners, it\u2019s hard to see a way for it to achieve sustained high-level growth. A slowdown in 2016 could derail both Obama\u2019s and the GOP\u2019s agendas and have major implications in a presidential election year.\n\nRelated: Low Oil Prices Pave the Way for New Carbon Taxes\n\nLower economic growth in Europe and Japan in particular, \u201ccertainly is a weight on U.S. economic growth,\u201d said Gus Faucher, a senior economist with PNC Financial Services Group. \u201cTrade has roughly been a net positive for growth over the past year or so, but I think trade is going to be a slight negative for growth\u201d in the near term.\n\nThe U.S. has a lot going for it at the moment, Faucher said. \u201cThe fundamentals in U.S. domestic demand are pretty strong, and pushing down oil prices has been a big positive for U.S.\u201d However, he said, \u201cThat\u2019s still not going to offset the drag from weak global growth.\u201d\n\nAnother problem may sound counterintuitive at first: a strong dollar.\n\nInvestors have been buying up dollars recently, which makes U.S. exports relatively more expensive, putting U.S. manufacturers at a disadvantage.\n\nRelated: As Gas Prices Drop, Gas Taxes Could Start to Rise\n\n\u201cIn the last year the dollar has appreciated a lot, and I think that\u2019s a big concern,\u201d said economist Barry P. Bosworth, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t shown up in the data yet, and we shouldn\u2019t expect it to.\u201d\n\nThe low price of oil and the economic uncertainty in other parts of the world have combined to make the U.S. economy look a little more robust than it might actually be, Bosworth said. \u201cOur own economy is not that strong right now,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be running a trade deficit, but not because our consumption is so strong. It\u2019s because we can\u2019t find adequate markets for our exports.\u201d\n\nHowever, he added, \u201cThe exchange rate does matter. It just matters with a long lag. It just takes a while for businesses to decide to change where they produce. I think it is going to be a significant problem at the end of the year, going into 2016.\u201d\n\nAnd the problems could grow if U.S. trading partners don\u2019t recover.\n\nRelated: Why the Dollar\u2019s Big Rebound Is a Mixed Blessing\n\n\u201cOne of the things I think people are overlooking is that not only does a stronger dollar hit U.S. exports, but it eventually begins to affect domestic spending and domestic growth,\u201d said Samuel Rines, an economist with Chilton Capital Management in Houston.\n\nBecause of a beneficial exchange rate, Rines said, foreign manufacturers such as Toyota, can cut prices on products sold in the U.S. without suffering a decline in profits when the proceeds are converted back into their home currency.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. benefits from global growth partly because we are still the largest manufacturer, but to a great extent the way we benefit is through being the dominant force in global trade,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe do a great deal of trade with Japan and Europe and we have seen the U.S. grow fairly well even when they are stagnating.\u201d However, he said, it\u2019s now getting to the point where \u201cthe U.S. really needs some of those importing zones to pick up.\u201d\n\nRelated: A New Congress Faces Many Old Problems\n\nFinally, the economy that lives by high oil prices might die by them, too.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. is a huge beneficiary of lower oil prices,\u201d Rines conceded. But he warned that continued low prices will eventually hurt the industry that has been the most consistent producer of well-paid low-skilled jobs.\n\nAs the oil patch begins to suffer from the price decline, he said, \u201cThat is going to be a big headwind to the US. When you don\u2019t have the lower skilled high wage job growth it\u2019s difficult to replace with anything.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The U.S. economy has shown signs suggesting it is in or near a full-blown recovery.
