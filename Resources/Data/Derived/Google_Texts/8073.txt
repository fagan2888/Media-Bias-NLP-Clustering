Guests Michele Bachmann: Republican congresswoman representing Minnesota's 6th District

U.S Rep. Michele Bachmann is denouncing the Obama Administration's newly-announced policy to restore diplomatic ties with Cuba as "inexplicable" and called the lengthy embargo of the Communist-run island effective.

"Until Cuba changes (its) ways, there's no reason for the United States to change its policy," Bachmann said on MPR News' The Daily Circuit Wednesday.

Reflecting on her unsuccessful 2012 bid for the White House, Bachmann argued that she "made a contribution to the race" and helped shift other GOP candidates toward a complete rejection of the Affordable Care Act.

Bachmann announced last year that she would not seek a fifth term after narrowly winning re-election in the staunchly Republican Minnesota 6th District.

When asked whether she planned another run for president, Bachmann said, "Not today," but added she planned to weigh in as a commentator and has already signed on with a speakers bureau and will write a syndicated column once her term expires on Jan. 6.
