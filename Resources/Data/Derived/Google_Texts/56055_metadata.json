Creative Commons\n\nAn 8-year-old child bride died on Sunday from internal injuries sustained during her wedding night in Yemen, Gulf News reported.\n\nThe girl, Rawan, bled severely after suffering vaginal tearing following her forced marriage to a 40-year-old man in the city of Hardh in the northwestern part of the country. As neighboring Kuwaiti officials expressed outrage, social activists in Yemen implored authorities to arrest the \u201cbeastly groom\u201d and members of the girl\u2019s family for prosecution.\n\nActivists in Yemen and around the world hope to end the practice of marrying young girls \u2014 at least one as young as 3 years old, in one media report \u2014 to men in rural areas. Although the Yemen government instituted an age minimum of 17 for marriage in 2009, the new law has been deemed by many in rural areas as \u201cun-Islamic.\u201d The country\u2019s parliament plans to review the law this month for a final decision.\n\nOn Monday and Tuesday, local bloggers in Yemen continued to express outrage, according to media reports. \u201cAll those who supported such a crime should also be punished,\u201d a blogger wrote under the pseudonym \u201cSad.\" \u201cIt was not fair at all and the marriage should not have happened even if some tribes believe that it is a good custom.\u201d\n\nStill others castigated the girl\u2019s family for practicing traditions mostly deemed backwards. \u201cRawan\u2019s family members are not humans,\u201d Bu Omar, another blogger, wrote. \u201cThey do not deserve to have children.\u201d\n\nRegardless of whether parliament upholds the law \u2014 or strengthens it \u2014 many observers believe social regulation begins with education, given a high illiteracy rate. According to media reports in the region, many parents simply fail to understand the medical dangers of forcing young girls into sexual relationships before puberty. Beyond mere ignorance of human physiology, however, is tribal custom in many rural areas, holding that young girls make obedient wives and would bear more children. Poor families also accede to financial pressure for \u201cbride prices\u201d of hundreds of dollars.\n\nThe United Nations Population Fund says that more than 140 million girls worldwide will be pushed into marriages between 2011 and 2020. Of those brides, 50 million will be girls under the age of 15.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "yemen girl, yemeni child bride, yemeni child brides, yemeni girl brides", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The death of an 8-year-old child bride Sunday in Yemen outraged many in the Middle East and around the world, as millions of young girls face forced marriage.", "title": "8-Year-Old Child Bride Dies In Yemen: How Underage Marriage Impacts Millions Of Girls Worldwide", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/rawan-8-year-old-child-bride-dies-yemen-how-underage-marriage-impacts-millions-girls-worldwide", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/10/activists-hope-end-practice-marrying-young-girls.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The death of an 8-year-old child bride Sunday in Yemen outraged many in the Middle East and around the world, as millions of young girls face forced marriage.", "title": "8-Year-Old Child Bride Dies In Yemen: How Underage Marriage Impacts Millions Of Girls Worldwide", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/rawan-8-year-old-child-bride-dies-yemen-how-underage-marriage-impacts-millions-girls-worldwide", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/10/activists-hope-end-practice-marrying-young-girls.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/10/activists-hope-end-practice-marrying-young-girls.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2013-09-10T11:34:18-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-10T11:34:17-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The death of an 8-year-old child bride Sunday in Yemen outraged many in the Middle East and around the world, as millions of young girls face forced marriage."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcde52\"", "article_summary": "The death of an 8-year-old child bride Sunday in Yemen outraged many in the Middle East and around the world, as millions of young girls face forced marriage.\nThe girl, Rawan, bled severely after suffering vaginal tearing following her forced marriage to a 40-year-old man in the city of Hardh in the northwestern part of the country.\nCreative CommonsAn 8-year-old child bride died on Sunday from internal injuries sustained during her wedding night in Yemen, Gulf News reported.\nAccording to media reports in the region, many parents simply fail to understand the medical dangers of forcing young girls into sexual relationships before puberty.\nBeyond mere ignorance of human physiology, however, is tribal custom in many rural areas, holding that young girls make obedient wives and would bear more children."}
