An Alabama congressional candidate uses a .40 Glock pistol, a .270 Cooper rifle and an AR-15 to destroy a copy of the Obamacare bill in a new video released by his campaign.

The message in candidate Will Brooke’s video, shared first with The Daily Caller on Wednesday, is clear: Republicans have been successful in taking shots at Obamacare, but it’s going to take “more extreme measures” to get rid of it.

“We’re down here to have a little fun today and talk about two serious subjects: the Second Amendment, and see how much damage we can do to this copy of Obamacare,” Brooke, sitting on the tailgate of a pick-up truck, says in the video.

Brooke, leaning on the thousands of pages of Obamacare, holds a copy of the Constitution in his hand while his rifle rests nearby.

The video shows him using a variety of firearms to shoot the copy of the bill. But when the bill is not completely destroyed, he turns to another piece of equipment.

“Well we had some fun and knocked some holes in it,” Brooke tells the camera, “but we didn’t quite get the job done. Looks like we’ll have to resort to more extreme measures to get rid of Obamacare and replace it with a market based solution.”

That’s when the Altec Whisper Chipper comes into play.

Brooke, a business executive, is running in a crowded Republican primary in Alabama’s 6th Congressional District race. The contest to fill the seat of retiring GOP Rep. Spencer Bachus.

“We need to get rid of ObamaCare,” he said in a statement. “Then we need to replace it with a conservative, market-based solution. This ad shows that we can have fun with a serious subject, but for those who have already been hurt by the law here in Alabama, it’s anything but funny. I will fight everyday to right the wrongs of ObamaCare.”

Other candidates have released similar videos: West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin used his rifle to shoot a Cap and Trade bill in a 2010 ad, for example.
