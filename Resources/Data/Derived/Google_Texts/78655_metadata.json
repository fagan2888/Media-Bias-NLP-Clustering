When they\u2019re not quoting the Bible to piss on climate change or trying to gut Social Security or voting for the 407th time to REPEAL OBAMACARE or fellating their corporate benefactors or holding their collective breath until the usurper resigns in disgrace or gets tried for treason, whichever, they\u2019re voting to make already-illegal taxpayer-funded abortions even more super-duper illegal, because they really, really want all you ambulating vaginas out there to get to babymakin\u2019, for God and country.\n\nAnd so we wondered: What other things that are already illegal should our esteemed representatives vote to make extra illegal, because apparently they are very bored and need something productive to do with their time?\n\nAbortions after 44 weeks.\n\nYeah, sure, Congress wants to ban abortions after 20 weeks \u2014 if those dumb Republican congressladies don\u2019t get in the way, that is \u2014 and banned late-term abortions a decade ago, but why stop there? We need a law to keep these Margaret Sanger acolytes from aborting their babies after they\u2019re born, too. The rights of the child must be protected!\n\nHeroin.\n\nHeroin is already a Class 1 drug (just like pot!), but this is not enough. We need to show the junkies what\u2019s up. Get on that shit, Boehner. America wants action.\n\nSharing state secrets with your sexytime friend.\n\nGiven recent events \u2014 here\u2019s looking at you, Petraeus \u2014 we need to make sure our spies know this is Not OK.\n\nNecrophilia.\n\nSure, making sweet, sweet love to the dearly departed is already illegal (outside of Louisiana, Oklahoma, Kansas and North Carolina, which also ban blowies, weird, and also Nebraska, New Mexico, and Vermont, which don\u2019t care what you fuck), but The People demand that we show our moral approbation. And what better way to do that then with an act of Congress?\n\nBuying smokes for preteens.\n\nSmoking accounts for nearly one in five American deaths a year. Where is the outrage, John Boehner? (Let us know when you get back from your smoke break, dude.)\n\nDefund the stupid hippies at ACORN\n\n(Which, ahem, no longer exists.) Oh wait, they actually do this.
