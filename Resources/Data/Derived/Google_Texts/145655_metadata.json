Its developers say they plan to seek FDA approval for what may be the first prescription-strength video game.\n\nOrigin\n\nMartucci, a vice president at venture firm PureTech Health, co-founded Akili in 2011 to develop non-drug-based treatments for brain maladies. He tapped memory and perception researcher Gazzaley to help make the game.\n\n1. Multitasking\n\nEvo forces players to make split-second decisions to engage what scientists call the brain\u2019s \u201cinterference filter,\u201d which prioritizes tasks and screens out distractions. In an early level, you steer a flying saucer through a canyon by tapping red obstacles and ignoring others.\n\n2. Development\n\nThe game detects a patient\u2019s ability and adjusts its speed as she advances. In later levels, the pace quickens and players must select multiple objects from a growing range of choices.\n\nFunding\n\nAkili says it\u2019s received more than $10 million from backers including PureTech and ADHD drugmaker Shire. It has yet to set a price for the game.\n\nOther tests\n\nPfizer in 2014 began a 100-person trial to determine whether Evo can help detect Alzheimer\u2019s. Akili plans to start a study on autism in the next few months.\n\nNext Steps\n\nOn Oct. 28, Martucci\u2019s team of scientists will present the results of an 80-patient ADHD study using the game at a medical conference in San Antonio. Akili says it expects to begin broader testing by yearend to support an FDA filing. That would give Evo an edge over nonprescription brain games, says Masud Husain, a neuroscience professor at the University of Oxford. But Husain says it\u2019s too early to know whether Akili\u2019s game will be effective in treating disorders other than ADHD.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Makiko Kitamura", "twitter": {"description": "A game that does more than build hand-eye coordination.", "title": "Project: Evo, the First Prescription-Strength Video Game?", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-22/project-evo-the-first-prescription-strength-video-game-", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ize.K9ABUD70/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "site": "@business", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-author": "Makiko Kitamura", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "technology", "news_keywords": "technology", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-22/project-evo-the-first-prescription-strength-video-game-", "parsely-title": "Project: Evo, the First Prescription-Strength Video Game?", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-10-22T19:22:13.998Z", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "A game that does more than build hand-eye coordination.", "parsely-tags": "technology,Region: Global,Page: article", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.bwbx.io/business/public/images/favicons/mstile-144x144-bbd2101292.png", "date": "2015-10-22T19:22:13.998Z", "parsely-section": "businessweek-magazine", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "og": {"site_name": "Bloomberg.com", "description": "A game that does more than build hand-eye coordination.", "title": "Project: Evo, the First Prescription-Strength Video Game?", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-22/project-evo-the-first-prescription-strength-video-game-", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ize.K9ABUD70/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "type": "website"}, "fb": {"status": "A game that does more than build hand-eye coordination."}, "parsely-post-id": "NWMS256JTSEF01", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "parsely-image-url": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ize.K9ABUD70/v1/-1x-1.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf253\"", "article_summary": "Its developers say they plan to seek FDA approval for what may be the first prescription-strength video game.\nBut Husain says it\u2019s too early to know whether Akili\u2019s game will be effective in treating disorders other than ADHD.\nThat would give Evo an edge over nonprescription brain games, says Masud Husain, a neuroscience professor at the University of Oxford.\nNext StepsOn Oct. 28, Martucci\u2019s team of scientists will present the results of an 80-patient ADHD study using the game at a medical conference in San Antonio.\nOriginMartucci, a vice president at venture firm PureTech Health, co-founded Akili in 2011 to develop non-drug-based treatments for brain maladies."}
