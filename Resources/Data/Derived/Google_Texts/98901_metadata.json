But Joe Frazier\u2019s real. And he\u2019s Philadelphia.\u201d\n\nArtist Stephen Layne is finishing up a 9-foot-tall clay version of \u201cSmokin\u2019 Joe\u201d that captures Philly\u2019s local hero in mid-punch. Frazier became the first fighter to beat Muhammad Ali when he outslugged \u201cThe Greatest\u201d for the heavyweight title in 1971.\n\nThe effort to memorialize Frazier, first announced two years ago, was almost knocked out by fundraising problems and the sudden death of the original sculptor. Layne, 46, won the commission the second time around and began working in March.\n\nSteering clear of the victorious, raised arms stance of the Rocky statue \u2014 which was originally a prop in \u201cRocky III\u201d \u2014 Layne instead found his spark in a photo of Frazier flooring Ali with his powerful left hook. The moment captured in the sculpture reflects the work ethic of Frazier and the city he called home, said Layne.\n\n\u201cThat pose of glory \u2026 the Rocky pose, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s quite the vibe of Philadelphia,\u201d Layne said while working in his studio in the Fishtown neighborhood.\n\nLayne, who was raised here, both attended and taught at the city\u2019s esteemed Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. He said he felt drawn to the Frazier project because of the shared Philadelphia connection and a sense that artists, too, must be fighters to survive in their field.\n\n\u201cIt was so obvious that (Frazier) was completely willing to get beat up \u2026 so that he could achieve what he wanted,\u201d Layne said. \u201cAnd I thought that was just an inspirational thing to watch.\u201d\n\nFrazier won the 1964 Olympic gold medal in Tokyo and later finished with a professional record of 32-4-1, with 27 knockouts. Two of the losses were epic rematches with Ali, including the \u201cThrilla in Manila\u201d in 1975.", "article_metadata": {"description": "9-foot Joe Frazier statue rising in Philadelphia", "author": "Kathy Matheson", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "9-foot Joe Frazier statue rising in Philadelphia", "title": "9-foot Joe Frazier statue rising in Philadelphia", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/09/02/9_foot_joe_frazier_statue_rising_in_philadelphia/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/joe-frazier-statue.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "9-foot Joe Frazier statue rising in Philadelphia", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/joe-frazier-statue.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "title": "9-foot Joe Frazier statue rising in Philadelphia", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "9-foot Joe Frazier statue rising in Philadelphia", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1517\"", "article_summary": "Will they line up for pictures with a sculpture of real hometown champion Joe Frazier?\nThe moment captured in the sculpture reflects the work ethic of Frazier and the city he called home, said Layne.\n\u201cThat pose of glory \u2026 the Rocky pose, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s quite the vibe of Philadelphia,\u201d Layne said while working in his studio in the Fishtown neighborhood.\nFrazier became the first fighter to beat Muhammad Ali when he outslugged \u201cThe Greatest\u201d for the heavyweight title in 1971.\nAnd he\u2019s Philadelphia.\u201dArtist Stephen Layne is finishing up a 9-foot-tall clay version of \u201cSmokin\u2019 Joe\u201d that captures Philly\u2019s local hero in mid-punch."}
