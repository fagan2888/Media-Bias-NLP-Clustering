The Affordable Care Act became a more popular option for Western New Yorkers and those in the Southern Tier during the second year of open enrollment.

More than 15,000 Erie County residents signed up for a private health insurance plan, about 2,000 more than during the first year of open enrollment, according to state data.

That's a 16-percent increase compared with the state average of 12 percent.

Chemung County, in the Southern Tier, saw a 45-percent jump in private health insurance enrollment, the largest increase in the state, but in line with the region.

In Broome County, an additional 800 people enrolled, a 31 percent increase. An additional 550 people enrolled in Steuben County, a 40 percent increase.

Downstate, Staten Island led the way with 1,300 additional enrollments, a 19 percent bump.
