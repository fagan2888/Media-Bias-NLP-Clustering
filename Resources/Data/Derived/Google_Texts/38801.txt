Longtime Hollywood star Kurt Russell has been making the rounds promoting the new Quentin Tarantino movie “The Hateful Eight,” and reluctantly revealed some insights on his politics. Russell is definitely on the right side of the political spectrum.

He first generated controversy in an interview with the Hollywood Reporter with some comments about increased gun control as a response to terrorism in the U.S.:

“If you think gun control is going to change the terrorists’ point of view, I think you’re, like, out of your mind.. I think it’s absolutely insane. If I’m a hockey team and I’ve got some guy bearing down on me as a goaltender, I’m not concerned about what he’s gonna do — I’m gonna make him concerned about what I’m gonna do to stop him. That’s when things change.”

The profile of his comments increased even more when he repeated his opinions on The View. Russell also acknowledges an extreme reluctance to talk politics, as well:

He laid out a broader explanation of his political opinions in an interview with The Daily Beast, detailing how examining the perspectives of the founders of the country influenced him:

“When I was a young guy, I was finding myself not quite being able to see the things that were going on and buy into a political culture. I didn’t know what to do, so I finally said, ‘Why don’t I go back and see what the Founding Fathers were all about, and see how that stacked up.’ Well, I found them and I found libertarianism. They were pretty radical guys, and damn smart, and I just believe in that old-time stuff and think they had great ideas. Years later, I had the wonderful opportunity to go to the Cato Institute’s 20th anniversary and spend some real time with some amazing people. I met some great people there, and that cemented it for me. I felt, guess what, there is a place where I can have a conversation and not be laughed at or smirked at.”

Russell also went so far as to call out another Hollywood libertarian, as well. Immediately after saying that he is a “hardcore libertarian,” he said that he was not a fake one like Bill Maher, who doesn’t even “know what it is.”
