But today Taylor Morrison will show you a single-family neighborhood where you could be inside Broomfield\u2019s coveted city limits, with a 3-car garage, starting from well under $350,000.\n\nThat\u2019s what Taylor Morrison\u2019s Jennifer Taylor and Jim Lettis can show you at The Village at Palisade Park \u2013 taking shape close to the new Children\u2019s Hospital on Highway 7, just west of I-25; and across from a site where University of Colorado Health is planning a 66-acre campus. You\u2019ll see the new hospital \u2013 but what you WON\u2019T see are finished models (they\u2019re still a month from finish \u2013 along with six for-sale homes that\u2019ll be ready for move in this fall).\n\nThe tradeoff for getting involved with Palisade Park now, while the layout still requires a little imagination, is pricing that is almost certain to go up before those models are complete, says Taylor Morrison\u2019s Becky Hunt. There\u2019s an Appaloosa ranch \u2013 two bedrooms plus a study, 1,819 square feet plus partial basement and a THREE-car garage, from $340,990; and a \u2018Caspian\u2019 (one of the models you\u2019ll see underway) with 2,643 feet, four bedrooms plus a main floor study and a kitchen sized for an oversized island and walk-in pantry, at only $375,990.\n\nMeanwhile, this location has four commuter routes working for it: close to I-25 into downtown or 120th Avenue; Highway 7/Baseline into Boulder; and quick access onto 470 \u2013 just ten minutes from Interlocken/Flatiron Crossing, and 25 minutes, door-to-door, to Denver International Airport. The area just to the west along Highway 7 has already generated some of the area\u2019s most attractive master-planned communities, with homes priced way beyond this.\n\nThose \u2018spec\u2019 homes underway, at prices likely to go up by model opening, include one of that Appaloosa ranch plan \u2013 full basement and 3-car garage, plus slab granite kitchen tops and stainless gas appliances, for just $409,975. Taylor Morrison has a park planned, anchored by a vintage barn you\u2019ll see on the west side that they\u2019re planning to preserve as a landmark. To visit The Village at Palisade Park, take I-25 north past 470 to the next exit, Highway 7, and turn west a half mile to Palisade Parkway \u2013 same entrance as Children\u2019s Hospital, then head north a half mile to Taylor Morrison\u2019s sales center.\n\nPre-sale of The Village at Palisade Park by Taylor Morrison, family-sized homes in city of Broomfield, 6 new plans including 2 ranches, 3-car garage standard on most. 502 W. 169th Pl., Broomfield; take I-25 north past 470 to Hwy 7, turn west \u00bd mile to Palisade Pkwy (entry to Children\u2019s Hospital), north to sales center\n\nFrom the high-$300s, summer deliveries from $409,975\n\n303-325-2445\n\nMark Samuelson writes on real estate and business; you can email him at mark@samuelsonassoc.com.You can see all of Mark Samuelson\u2019s columns at DenverPost.com/RealEstate.
