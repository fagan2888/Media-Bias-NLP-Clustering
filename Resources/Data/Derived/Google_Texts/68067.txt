In her first book The End of the Suburbs: Where the American Dream is Moving, author Leigh Gallagher observes a growing trend in America’s housing landscape: fewer people are choosing to live in suburbs. This hour, Leigh joins us to explain some of the forces driving Americans out of suburbia, and give us a glimpse of what the post-cul-de-sac future might look like.

Later in the show, we talk to some Michigan researchers about the future of urban design in North America’s largest megaregion. It’s the subject of a new exhibit opening at the Yale School of Architecture later this month.

We also hear from a local professor whose new study takes a closer look at the relationship between street design and public health.
