It was a dancing good time at the Holiday Inn on N Frontage Rd. Saturday.

Ladies from the Red Hat Society came together for a big meeting and a big time. The ladies enjoyed refreshments, music, and a whole lot of dancing. Ladies from all over Mississippi were at the meeting. Several counties were represented.

"I have about 160 of my Red Hat ladies and we have truly been having fun all day. This has truly been a dream of mine. I always told my momma one day I will do this, and Lord it is today," Annie Hill says.

This was the ladies 12th annual spring fling.
