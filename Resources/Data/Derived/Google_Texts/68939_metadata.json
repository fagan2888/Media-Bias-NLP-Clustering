It was more a case that conservatives lacked the vast resources consistently available to the left (and coming largely from dues money forcibly extracted from unionized workers) to develop and air any kind of meaningful response.\n\nThanks to Citizens United, however, the economics of the equation have equalized, which is probably why President Barack Obama and his left-liberal allies in the House and Senate hate the decision so much. They realized immediately it meant conservatives would be able, individually or in consort with one another, to put much-needed resources into fighting back against the liberal smear machine that so dominated American politics from the 1970s into the current decade. Not only that, but it has enabled conservatives to mount an offense, criticizing liberals on issues the left once though it owned, such as the all-too-cozy relationship between certain candidates and the business community.\n\n[Check out our collection of political cartoons on Super PACs.]\n\nMost of America probably thinks that the Republicans are the party of so-called \u201cbig business\u201d while the Democrats are busy \u201cfighting for the little guy.\u201d It\u2019s an image the party of FDR, JFK and Jimmy Carter encourage \u2013 even if it\u2019s not necessarily true, as demonstrated by a pair of ads recently put up by the conservative Freedom Partners, a group with plans to be a major player in the upcoming elections.\n\nThe ads highlight the hypocrisy of Colorado Sen. Mark Udall and Iowa Rep. Bruce Braley \u2013 who is running for the Senate seat being vacated by fellow Democrat Tom Harkin \u2013 on the health care issue. Udall and Braley are the beneficiaries of ads paid for by the Senate Majority PAC, which wants Nevada\u2019s Harry Reid to stay on as majority leader, that portray them as standing up for ordinary American against the nation\u2019s evil health insurance companies.\n\nWhat the Senate Majority PAC ads don\u2019t explain, but the Freedom Partners\u2019 spots do, is that while Braley and Udall have supposedly been standing up for the little guy, they\u2019ve been sitting down with folks who support Obamacare \u2013 which has been a major boon to the health insurance industry and practically guarantees them a federal bailout if the new health care law does not generate the promised economic activity \u2013 and have been taking money from special interests tied to the health insurance industry.\n\n[See a collection of political cartoons on Obamacare.]\n\nFurther, thanks to the lack of objectivity among the media, who hesitated to say a negative word about Obamacare as it was being formulated, most people don\u2019t know that the administration worked hand-in-hand with the health insurance industry to develop the legislation. When Republicans do that it\u2019s called \u201cgenerating the appearance of a conflict of interest,\u201d triggering a congressional investigation. When Democrats do it they don\u2019t get called on it, largely because nobody who wants to make a big deal out of it has the resources to do so and must depend on others, like the media, to carry the message forward.\n\nWhen you look closely at Obamacare, you can see a number of ways in which it benefited the industry, from the aforementioned protections against financial loss to billions of dollars in taxpayer subsidies to the individual mandate itself, which compels people, under threat of fine, to buy health insurance whether they want it or not.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "peter-roff/blogentries", "keyword": "Politics [News]", "title": "Citizens United Helps Conservatives Tell the Real Obamacare Story", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Thanks to Citizens United, the right can now explain how the Democrats are in bed with big business.", "title": "Telling the Real Obamacare Story", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/peter-roff/2014/04/09/citizens-united-helps-conservatives-tell-the-real-obamacare-story", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/96/32/fb6d2e9346b4af6f3eb05d8026f5/140331-obamacare-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "Thanks to Citizens United, the right can now explain how the Democrats are in bed with big business.", "card": "summary", "title": "Citizens United Helps Conservatives Tell the Real Obamacare Story"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "opinion", "date_published": "April 9, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Peter Roff,Citizens United,campaign finance,Supreme Court,politics,Democratic Party,Republican Party,super PACs,Politics [News]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Thanks to Citizens United, the right can now explain how the Democrats are in bed with big business."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcee51\"", "article_summary": "Not that you will hear much about it, but the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in the Citizens United case has actually helped to level the playing field of American politics.\nThanks to Citizens United, however, the economics of the equation have equalized, which is probably why President Barack Obama and his left-liberal allies in the House and Senate hate the decision so much.\nWhen Republicans do that it\u2019s called \u201cgenerating the appearance of a conflict of interest,\u201d triggering a congressional investigation.\n[See a collection of political cartoons on Obamacare.]\nIt was more a case that conservatives lacked the vast resources consistently available to the left (and coming largely from dues money forcibly extracted from unionized workers) to develop and air any kind of meaningful response."}
