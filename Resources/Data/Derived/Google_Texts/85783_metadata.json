The relationship between these additional services and any meaningful improvement in outcomes is undefined,\u201d according to the report. \u201cThe goals of payment reform are currently unrealized, as evidenced in these data.\u201d\n\nCritics of the pay-for-procedure model have said that doctors have more financial incentive to spend their time ordering potentially unnecessary tests or procedures for a single patient than to efficiently treat an individual and move on.\n\n\n\n[Study: U.S. Doctors Cutting Back on Painkiller Prescriptions]\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services adopted the Shared Savings Program as part of 2010\u2019s Affordable Care Act as a transition into a payment system based less on individual procedures and more on individual outcomes. Many believed it would help shift health care spending away from pay-per-procedure and into a more outcome-based payment model.\n\n\u201cOur findings suggest a weakness in fee-for-service medicine,\u201d said Dr. Jonathan Bergman, assistant professor of urology and family medicine at UCLA\u2019s David Geffen School of Medicine and an urologist and bioethicist at the Veterans\u2019 Health Administration in Los Angeles. \u201cPerhaps it would make more sense to reimburse clinicians for providing high-quality care, or for treating more patients.\u201d\n\nBut UCLA\u2019s study suggests the nation\u2019s highest-paid doctors still benefit from a fee-for-service payment model. The report created a ratio for the number of services provided to individual recipients compared to total Supplementary Medical Insurance payments from the 2012 calendar year, which cover physician visits, outpatient visits and procedures, and certain ongoing services like chemotherapy and laboratory testing. Ultimately, highly paid doctors were found to receive more payment for multiple tests on one patient than for treating multiple patients.\n\n\n\n[ALSO: Few Depressed Americans Seek Care]\n\n\u201cGiven the data on medical service utilization in the United States, it is likely that a substantial portion of these services is unrelated to improved outcomes,\u201d according to the report. \u201cIn Medicare\u2019s fee-for-service system, some physicians are collecting large fees by ordering services munificently.\u201d\n\nThese additional tests may or may not be to the patient\u2019s ultimate benefit. Medicare Accountable Care Organizations have been set up to reward health care professionals and organizations who treat patients efficiently, not just comprehensively and potentially unnecessarily.\n\nAccountable Care Organizations do not inherently outlaw the fee-for-service model of payment. Instead, those enrolled in the program become eligible for shared funds resulting from saved health care costs, provided certain procedural savings requirements are met, according to the Office of the Federal Register. The Accountable Care Organizations are intended to provide a financial incentive to effectively and efficiently caring for patients.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "newsgram/articles", "keyword": "Featured: Collections: Newsgram", "title": "Study: Doctors Paid More for Multiple Procedures Than for Multiple Patients", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "The nation's highest-paid medical professionals may have financial incentive to conduct unnecessary procedures,&nbsp;says a new UCLA report.", "title": "Study: Doctors Paid More for Multiple Procedures Than for Multiple Patients", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/newsgram/articles/2014/12/08/study-doctors-paid-more-for-multiple-procedures-than-for-multiple-patients", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/ad/a4/63259e0f45c8b49fcaed56e368e1/141201-checkup-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The nation's highest-paid medical professionals may have financial incentive to conduct unnecessary procedures,&nbsp;says a new UCLA report.", "site": "@USNews", "card": "summary", "title": "Study: Doctors Paid More for Multiple Procedures Than for Multiple Patients"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "news", "date_published": "Dec. 8, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Andrew Soergel,health care,Affordable Care Act,health care reform,Pulse,picks,Collections: Newsgram,Featured: Collections: Newsgram", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "The nation's highest-paid medical professionals may have financial incentive to conduct unnecessary procedures,&nbsp;says a new UCLA report."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0300\"", "article_summary": "Highly-paid doctors make more money ordering multiple procedures for individual patients than they earn seeing multiple patients, according to a study released Monday by the UCLA Department of Urology and the Veterans\u2019 Health Administration.\nUltimately, highly paid doctors were found to receive more payment for multiple tests on one patient than for treating multiple patients.\nMedicare Accountable Care Organizations have been set up to reward health care professionals and organizations who treat patients efficiently, not just comprehensively and potentially unnecessarily.\nThe Accountable Care Organizations are intended to provide a financial incentive to effectively and efficiently caring for patients.\nMany believed it would help shift health care spending away from pay-per-procedure and into a more outcome-based payment model."}
