And last night, Outkast's Andre 3000 (better known in film circles as Andre Benjamin) sported a pair of vintage workman overalls while headlining the first night of Coachella's first weekend.\n\nIn front of a crowd that included Benjamin's \"idol\" Prince (who technically enjoyed the show from backstage), the rapper/actor sang hits including \"B.O.B.\", \"Rosa Parks\" and \"Roses,\" all while wearing the railroad striped one-piece. Underneath, the performer wore a tie-dyed T-shirt and -- wait for it -- a sweatshirt that, we're told, was \"repping his son's high school.\" Darling.\n\nThis isn't the first time this particular pair of overalls made an appearance on Benjamin, after debuting at a Compound event in Atlanta in January. But last November, the stylish singer got even crazier with the denim, opting for a pair of overalls over a chambray shirt that was topped with a jean jacket.
