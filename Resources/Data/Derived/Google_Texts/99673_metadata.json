But the Kentucky senator isn\u2019t free of the distraction: one count remains and prosecutors are expected to call Paul as a witness when the trial starts in Des Moines, Iowa on Tuesday.\n\nThe charges stem from the 2012 presidential campaign of Rand Paul\u2019s father Ron, the former Texas congressman. During that cycle, three long time family operatives allegedly paid former Iowa state sen. Kent Sorenson to endorse the elder Paul, switching allegiances from U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann in exchange for $73,000 disguised as \u201caudio/visual expenses.\u201d\n\nLast August Sorenson plead guilty to obstruction of justice and causing a campaign to falsely report expenditures, and he now awaits sentencing. But it wasn\u2019t until this August\u2013on the eve of the first Republican presidential debate\u2013that the three aides were indicted in the alleged scheme. The Paul family accused the government of making a politically-timed case.\n\nRELATED: Ron Paul to testify at trial of campaign aides\n\nOn Friday, however, that case suffered a serious setback. A federal judge threw out all the charges against John Tate, an advisor to both Rand and Ron Paul, and the former head of America\u2019s Liberty, a pro-Paul super-PAC. At the same time, Jess Benton, who is married to Ron\u2019s granddaughter and who also used to run the America\u2019s Liberty super-PAC, beat four of the five charges against him.\n\nAnd yet the potential for Paul family embarrassment and presidential campaign problems remains high heading into the new week. Federal prosecutors will go forward with a case claiming that Benton lied to the FBI, while a third Paul lieutenant, Dimitri Kesari, faces six separate counts all related to campaign fraud.\n\nThe three men have plead not guilty. The Paul campaign, meanwhile, has been framing the case as a political hack job. \u201cIt certainly appears suspiciously timed and possibly, politically motivated,\u201d one aide told TPM in a statement. \u201cAdditionally, these actions are from 2012 and have nothing to do with our campaign.\u201d\n\nRecently, Rand Paul himself has gone silent about the morals and makings of his old advisors. But last year he was expressed confidence that at least Benton was a good guy, doing good work.\n\n\u201cI think Jesse is honest, he\u2019s good at politics and I don\u2019t think he\u2019s done anything wrong,\u201d Paul told Louisville TV station WHAS in December. \u201cAnd frankly it\u2019s so complicated if we threaten people with penalties that are above and beyond sort of, \u2018You need to pay a fine for being late on something,\u2019 I think we\u2019re going to scare a lot of good people away from helping.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "A federal judge knocked down four counts of fraud against a top advisor to Rand Paul.
