He said Maine has the fifth-highest spending per capita on health care in the nation.\n\nCorcoran also trumpeted the launch of Anthem\u2019s Enhanced Personal Health Care Program. The program is aimed at improving communications and the relationship between patients and their doctors in hopes of keeping people out of the hospital whenever possible through preventative care.\n\nSince its launch in July, 800 primary care physicians have signed on, he said. The result has been fewer hospital admissions, readmissions and fewer emergency room visits that will help keep the costs of health care \u2014 and insurance \u2014 down over the long term.\n\nThe one constant in the health care industry is that \u201cthings are constantly changing,\u201d Corcoran said, and providers and insurers need to adapt.\n\nCorcoran didn\u2019t mention a recent U.S. Department of Health and Human Services report indicating that startup nonprofit Maine Community Health Options, or MCHO, is outpacing Anthem in the number of signups in the marketplace. Kevin Lewis, who leads MCHO, has said 80 percent of Mainers enrolling have chosen options through his organization. Anthem has yet to provide its figure.\n\nCorcoran took no questions from the audience at the event in Hermon. When asked about the report in the parking lot as he was leaving, Corcoran said he hadn\u2019t reviewed it.\n\nSince the launch of healthcare.gov on Oct. 1 of last year, 13,704 Maine residents selected a health plan through the federal government\u2019s gateway for the marketplaces as of Dec. 28, 2013, according to a report from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. That\u2019s an eightfold increase compared to the month of November.\n\nBDN reporter Jackie Farwell contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "BANGOR, Maine \u2014 The head of Maine health insurance giant Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield of Maine said that in spite of the beleaguered launch of the the online marketplace under the Affordable Care Act, the exchange will continue to stabilize, as will prices.
