"The question is, is it going to be tomorrow or three months or six months from now?" Timmer said of a rebound.



In looking at what's behind the volatility, Timmer said it all boils down to the relationship between the yuan and the U.S. dollar. As China moves to devalue its overvalued currency, U.S. liquidity markets suffer.



"As [China] does that, it needs to intervene and draw down its foreign exchange reserves. and if you do that by 100 billion a month, that's like global tightening," said Timmer, "That's a transmission effect."



The effect of this swings U.S. markets, hitting earnings in the oil patch and in the material sector, and thus bringing down earnings for the overall stock market here in the U.S.

This back and forth will continue, but the upswing side of the U.S. market's V-shape could should be coming soon, Timmer said.
