James Milgram, professor emeritus, Stanford University, and a member of the Validation Committee for Common Core national math standards, has explained that by the end of the seventh grade, Common Core math is about two years behind the math of other high-achieving countries. [1]\n\nEmmit McGrourty speaks out about another shocking change; traditionally, the teaching ratio was 80% classical literature, 20% informational text. Common Core will modify it to 50% classical literature, 50% informational text, like reading computer instructional manuals. McGrourty says, \u201cClassical literature is the foundation of our nation. It teaches children to: investigate their surroundings; to make wise decisions, to have empathy; it teaches them how to exercise their liberty.\u201d [2]\n\nClassical literature has always embodied the collective wisdom of mankind, including all aspects of human experience and uplift. What do the elitist Agenda 21 backers plan to substitute in this vacuum \u2013 just a benign banality of mediocrity, or is it one more training aspect for a sinister end-plan of dismantling sovereignty, gaining total global control and then instituting the days that Pol Pot, Stalin, Mao and Hitler adored \u2013 eugenics, and the eventual annihilation of most of mankind? (Especially the ones who do not espouse \u201cgreen Agenda 21 ideals\u201d and perhaps unthinkably, those who are handicapped or considered \u201cdefective\u2019 racially or ethnically.)\n\nIn the introduction to her essay, A \u201cCommon Core\u201d for a Global Community, Berit Kjos states:\n\nWhile preparing this booklet I came across a headline that illustrates the corrupt values and shameless propaganda behind UNESCO\u2019s Common Core indoctrination. Ponder this assignment: \u201cStudents Asked to Argue \u2018That Jews Are Evil\u2019 and Prove Nazi Loyalty in Assignment Linked to Common Core.\u201d [3]\n\nIndeed, the old Third Reich evils were never fully eliminated. Newsweek, September 17, 2012\u2019s cover article, \u201cThe Nazis at the Heart of the Worst Drug Scandal of All Time,\u201d by Roger Williams and Jonathan Stone, documents how in the 1950\u2019s German company Chemie Gr\u00fcnenthal recruited a large ex-Nazi connection in the development of its drug, thalidomide. Heading the company\u2019s advisory committee was mass murderer Otto Ambrose, who had been convicted at Nuremberg to eight years in prison. Newsweek states:\n\nAmong those invited to Stolberg was Martin Staemmler, a leading proponent of the Nazi \u201cracial hygiene\u201d program. Following Germany\u2019s invasion of Poland, he had worked with the SS on its population policy, deciding who should live and who shouldn\u2019t. At Gr\u00fcnenthal, he was head of pathology at the time thalidomide was being sold\u2026 Another euthanasia enthusiast was Heinz Berger-Prinz, who worked with Hitler\u2019s personal physician, Karl Brandt\u2026 Brandt was executed after he was found guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity for his involvement in medical experiments and procedures on prisoners and civilians. [4]\n\nThe only uniformed Nazi known to have been at Gr\u00fcnenthal \u2013 though not involved in the thalidomide program \u2013 was Dr. Ernst-G\u00fcnther Schenck. As SS inspector of nutrition, he developed a protein sausage tested on 370 concentration camp prisoners, many of whom were killed. Barred from working as a doctor in Germany, Schenck was hired by Gr\u00fcnenthal, as was Heinz Baumk\u00f6tter, the chief concentration camp doctor at Mauthausen and Sachsenhausen.\n\nRight now, today, here in America, TSA Gestapo-like tactics are ominously beginning to target handicapped children in the airports. Infowars.com reported, February 21, 2013, the case of Lucy Schulte, a three-year-old girl, wheelchair bound with spina bifida. TSA goons stopped Lucy, distressed her and confiscated her stuffed toy. Her mother, Annie, informed agents they could not touch her daughter unless she was filming the incident on her mobile phone. The TSA screeners replied that such filming was \u201cillegal.\u201d You-Tube uploaded the shocking scene of this darling child weeping, \u201cI don\u2019t want to go to Disney World anymore.\u201d\n\nThis is not as isolated case. The Huffington Post, April 18, 2013 told the story of Marla Murasko, mother of a Down\u2019s Syndrome son: \u201cDid the TSA Harass Us Because of Our Special Needs Son?\u201d\n\nUnder new FERPA regulations, January 3, 2012, government can now legally access all Personally Identified Information on students and their families. FERPA also adds \u201ca biometric record.\u201d This could mean fingerprints, retina and iris patterns, individual DNA, unique personal voiceprints, facial characteristics and handwriting.\n\nIf Common Core completes its stranglehold on local school systems\u2019 freedom of thought and action, will we see as in Nazi Germany, dissenting teachers weeded out and the curriculum re-written so that more and more brainwashed students will not only espouse green planetary \u201cGaia\u201d ideals, that man is no more than a rock or a wolf, but that eugenics is a pragmatic necessity for achieving depopulation goals. Already, Planned Parenthood\u2019s key abortion centers, such as the huge Houston facility, target African-American neighborhoods. Alex Jones reports that there are more African-Americans being aborted than there are African-American children being born.\n\n\n\nSubscribe to NewsWithViews Daily E-Mail Alerts!\n\n\n\n\n\nEventually, eugenics (Satan\u2019s death machine) will progressively threaten all of us. Obamacare will weed out the over-65\u2019s. But will you, as parents and grandparents, prevent implementation once more of the kind of Nazi methods Orlean Koehle describes in her book, Common Core, A Trojan Horse for Education Reform?\n\nTeachers were asked to play an active role in the Nazi racial program and applied the \u201cprinciples\u201d of racial science. They measured students\u2019 physical characteristics, including skull size and nose length, and recorded the color of hair and eyes to determine whether they belonged to the true \u201cAryan race.\u201d This data was gathered and give to German officials\u2026 [5]\n\nWe know the eventual horrendous outcomes for Jewish, Mischling (mixed Jewish-Aryan) and Romani (Gypsy) children. Is it ominous that the \u201cdifferentiated recognition\u201d aspect of Common Core requires teachers and schools to report on students\u2019 socio-economic, racial and political backgrounds? Is this the beginning of humanity\u2019s ultimate \u201cFinal Selection\u201d and \u201cFinal Solution\u201d?\n\n\u00a9 2014 Elizabeth Cuppett Caverly - All Rights Reserved\n\nFootnotes:", "article_metadata": {}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccb39\"", "article_summary": "In the introduction to her essay, A \u201cCommon Core\u201d for a Global Community, Berit Kjos states:While preparing this booklet I came across a headline that illustrates the corrupt values and shameless propaganda behind UNESCO\u2019s Common Core indoctrination.\nJames Milgram, professor emeritus, Stanford University, and a member of the Validation Committee for Common Core national math standards, has explained that by the end of the seventh grade, Common Core math is about two years behind the math of other high-achieving countries.\nCOMMON CORE CURRICULUMBy Elizabeth Cuppett CaverlyMarch 23, 2014NewsWithViews.comNazi Societal Restructuring Tool?\nCommon Core will modify it to 50% classical literature, 50% informational text, like reading computer instructional manuals.\n[1]Emmit McGrourty speaks out about another shocking change; traditionally, the teaching ratio was 80% classical literature, 20% informational text."}
