Trump said his robocalls are 'listened to more than anybody else’s robo.' Trump: GOP wants his 'robocalls'

If you live in Kentucky or New Hampshire, that next phone call could be from Donald Trump.

Trump told Fox News’ “Fox and Friends” on Monday he might be making house calls this election cycle for Republicans such as Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, and former Sen. Scott Brown, who’s running in New Hampshire.

“I have a lot of people that want to run for office or who are running for office … and it’s not even the money that they want, they want robocalls,” Trump said. “That’s the new thing, you do a robo.”

Trump said that McConnell will be visiting New York on Monday seeking support from “The Donald” and that Brown plans to visit as well.

“Mitch McConnell is coming up [Monday] who I have been supporting. … They just want support and Scott Brown is coming up to see me, I mean a lot of people come up to see me,” Trump said.

Trump cited his “very unblemished” record and said his robocalls are “listened to more than anybody else’s robo” as reasons that senators and other Republican candidates reach out to him at election time. In 2012, Trump made robocalls for Mitt Romney in several states.

“They come up to see me and if I can help and if I like the people and I believe in the people I will take the time and do what I have to do,” Trump said.

Brown and McConnell’s campaign offices did not immediately respond for comment.

Later on Monday, Trump tweeted “Why would the people of Kentucky want a rookie Senator— they have Sen. Mitch @McConnellPress who may be next Speaker & bring $’s to KY?”
