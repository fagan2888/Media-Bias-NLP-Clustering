'Well, we are going to bomb more,'\u201d he said. \"Well, who is it you are going to bomb? Where is it that you are going to bomb? When you talk about something like carpet-bombing, what do you mean?\" Obama asked, questioning a plan espoused on the campaign trail by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), who is surging the polls.\n\n\"If the suggestion is that we kill tens or hundreds of thousands of innocent Syrians and Iraqis, that is not who we are,\" Obama said. \"That would be a strategy that would have enormous backlash against the United States. It would be terrible for our national security.\"\n\nRelated: America\u2019s Top General Says We\u2019re Not Ready to Defeat ISIS\n\nDuring the CNN-sponsored debate in Las Vegas, moderator Wolf Blitzer tried to pin Cruz down on his \"carpet bombing\" proposal, asking if he would bomb the ISIS capital of Raqqa, where thousands of civilians live.\n\n\u201cYou would carpet bomb where ISIS is -- not a city, but the location of the troops. You use air power directed -- and you have embedded Special Forces to direct the air power. But the object isn't to level a city. The object is to kill the ISIS terrorists,\u201d he replied, a deviation from a previous statement to bomb the group so much people would learn \u201cif sand can glow in the dark.\u201d\n\nObama said it\u2019s \u201cimportant in this seat to make sure that you are making your best judgments based on data, intelligence, the information that's coming from your commanders and folks on the ground, and you're not being swayed by politics.\u201d He singled out Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) for praise.\n\n\"To his credit, I think Lindsey Graham is one of the few who has been at least honest about suggesting 'here is something I would do that the president is not doing.' He doesn't just talk about being louder or sounding tougher in the process,\u201d he said of Graham, who dropped out of the race Monday morning.\n\nRelated: One More Year of Obama, the President Out of Sync with America\n\nDemocratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton wasn\u2019t spared from Obama\u2019s whiplash, either. Obama dismissed the idea of a \u201cno-fly zone\u201d or \u201csafe zone,\u201d something Clinton has called for in recent months, noting that setting up such a perimeter can\u2019t be done \u201cwithout large number of troops on the ground\u201d and would be geared more toward containing the strife in Syria, not eliminating ISIS.\n\nLest he look out of touch the way he did in an Oval Office address following the incident in California, Obama admitted there is \u201clegitimate criticism\u201d that he hasn\u2019t done enough to assuage an anxious public. \"If you have been watching television for the last month, all you have been seeing, all you have been hearing about is these guys with masks or black flags who are potentially coming to get you,\" he said.\n\nObama also conceded he hasn\u2019t explained U.S. efforts against ISIS well enough. \u201cSo if people haven't seen that in fact 9,000 strikes have been carried out against ISIL, if they don't know that towns like Sinjar that were controlled by ISIL have been taken back, or that a town like Tikrit, that was controlled by ISIL, now has been repopulated by previous residents, then they might feel as if there is not enough of a response,\" he said.\n\nBut that\u2019s as far as he would go toward grading himself.\n\n\u201cI make no apologies for us wanting to [go after terrorist targets] appropriately and in a way that is consistent with American values,\u201d Obama said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "President Obama seems to be running out of patience with Republican presidential contenders knocking his plans for destroy the Islamic State and other terror groups.", "title": "Running Out of Patience, Obama Rebuffs Attacks on His ISIS Strategy", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/21/Running-Out-Patience-Obama-Rebuffs-Attacks-His-ISIS-Strategy", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-obama_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/21/Running-Out-Patience-Obama-Rebuffs-Attacks-His-ISIS-Strategy", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-obama_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "President Obama seems to be running out of patience with Republican presidential contenders knocking his plans for destroy the Islamic State and other terror groups.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "President Obama is running out of patience with Republican presidential contenders knocking his plans for fighting ISIS and other terror groups.\nRelated: One More Year of Obama, the President Out of Sync with AmericaDemocratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton wasn\u2019t spared from Obama\u2019s whiplash, either.\n\u201cYou would carpet bomb where ISIS is -- not a city, but the location of the troops.\nObama asked, questioning a plan espoused on the campaign trail by Sen.
