Rand Paul blamed the central bank for its role in the Las Vegas Valley's \u2014 and nation's \u2014 housing bubble.\n\nPaul, speaking to an audience of more than 110 at an Economic Club of Las Vegas luncheon inside Caesars Palace, linked Fed policies to the city's real estate struggles.\n\n\"I understand there was a little bit of a real estate bubble here. The question is, why did it occur?\" Paul said.\n\nHe partly blamed cheap money \u2014 the low interest rates that made borrowing to build more affordable.\n\nAs building heated up in the boom, banks continued to give homebuilders inexpensive construction loans, Paul said. That's in contrast to what would have happened in a market-based rate climate: Rates would have risen as demand for money increased, and that dynamic would have put loans out of range for some builders and prevented overconstruction, he said.\n\n\"Everything slows down and people start taking precautions. You get a feedback,\" Paul said.\n\nHe called for a rate system that would be market-based, rising and falling with demand for loans.\n\n\"If we don't learn from the past, if we don't have a discussion of this, how are we ever going to prevent it from happening again?\" he added.\n\nNevada's experiences with the Affordable Care Act also came up in a question-and-answer session after Paul's speech.\n\nNevada Health CO-OP, a nonprofit insurer created under the federal law to provide competition for existing insurers, announced in August that it would close because of high claims costs and \"limited\" growth forecasts.\n\nPaul said the Affordable Care Act improved access to health care, but it also has forced up premiums. That's because a growing number of subsidized consumers means fewer paying people to carry the costs of coverage.\n\nPaul said his fixes would include broad expansion of health savings accounts, plus options for higher deductibles that would encourage consumers to shop around for care. \"Inexpensive plans\" with high deductibles \u2014 $5,000 or $10,000 per consumer \u2014 are \"illegal\" now, Paul said.\n\nAllowing people to buy multiyear insurance plans that would lock in premiums over a longer term would also help, he said.\n\nPaul fielded a question about Yucca Mountain as well. His take on the proposed nuclear-waste site was succinct: \"With land in general, I'd be inclined to give land back to the states and you decide what you want to do with Yucca Mountain,\" he said to applause.\n\nPaul acknowledged he isn't polling well. He hovers in the 2 percent to 3 percent range among Republican primary voters.\n\nBut he added that he thinks the polls are wrong, and he has a good shot at winning Nevada. The state has 13,000 Republican caucus-goers, compared with about 30,000 Republican primary voters in Iowa.\n\nHe likened taking Nevada to \"winning a city council race.\"\n\nContact Jennifer Robison at jrobison@reviewjournal.com.
