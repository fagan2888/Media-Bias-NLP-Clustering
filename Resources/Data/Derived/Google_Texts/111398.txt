ANDREA MITCHELL: Congresswoman, what about this poll? It shows that, first of all, among the millennials, many of them think that it will be more expensive. Only 13% say they will definitely enroll, 16% will probably, 41% are split. They're also concerned about costs. We see in this poll that 40% think the care will be worse, 37% think care will be the same, 18% think it will be better. Don't we have to -- doesn't the White House have to get more support from these young people in order to make the risk pool work effectively?



REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ (D-FL), DNC CHAIR: Well, over the next weeks and months, the White House as well as Democratic members of Congress and folks across the administration are going to be continuing to get the word out about the opportunity to sign up for coverage, the benefits of signing up for coverage.



You know, for millennials, young adults in particular, because they have an opportunity to stay on their parents' insurance until they're 26 years old, many of them need to be aware they can do that. That's going to give them comprehensive coverage that so many of them don't have now.



And the focus needs to be on making sure that we can get young people who are often healthier into the pool so that it lowers the overall cost of health insurance. Whether it's making sure they get access to preventive care like mammograms without a co-pay or deductible or making sure -- or a well-woman visit without a co-pay or deductible, or birth control for free so they can plan their families in the way they want to. That's why I think gradually you'll have millennials fully embrace the Affordable Care Act, and it's going to be really an incredible opportunity.
