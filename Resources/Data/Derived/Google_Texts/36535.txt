The recent 5-4 ruling in favour of same-sex marriage and 6-3 ruling in favour of Obamacare subsidies have sparked a conservative backlash against the Supreme Court, including from Jindal, who said the court appears to be more interested in following public opinion polls than abiding by the Constitution.

Annoyed with Supreme Court rulings on Obamacare and same sex marriages, Republican presidential aspirant Bobby Jindal has said if given a chance he would toss out half-a-dozen judges of the apex court, including two nominated by Presidents George W Bush and Ronald Reagan.

The recent 5-4 ruling in favour of same-sex marriage and 6-3 ruling in favour of Obamacare subsidies have sparked a conservative backlash against the Supreme Court, including from Jindal, who said the court appears to be more interested in following public opinion polls than abiding by the Constitution. Since announcing his candidacy in June, the 44-year-old Indian-American Louisiana Governor has suggested that the nation could save some money by shuttering the court.

"Hillary Clinton didn't like that answer," Jindal said at the RedState Gathering in Atlanta on Friday. "She thought that was extreme, so I have a compromise: instead of getting rid of the entire Supreme Court what if we got rid of about two-thirds of the Supreme Court," Jindal was quoted as saying by Washington Times.

"I mean there are three justices that got it right," he said. "I wouldn't mind keeping Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas and Antonio Scalia. It is the other six I wouldn't mind getting rid of," he added. The six members he wants to remove include Chief Justice John G Roberts Jr, nominated by Bush, and Anthony M Kennedy, nominated by Reagan.

Roberts and Kennedy ruled in favour of the Obamacare subsidies. Kennedy also supported the same-sex marriage ruling. Obamacare is a US law aimed at reforming the American healthcare system.
