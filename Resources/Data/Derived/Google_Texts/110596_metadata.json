Clippers point guard Chris Paul, along with Golden State Warriors point guard Stephen Curry, Monday urged Californians to sign up for health insurance through the Affordable Care Act.\n\nPaul and Curry took part in an event, sponsored by Kaiser Permanente, with the intention of communicating the message that health insurance and healthy lifestyles are essential.\n\n\u201cWe can reach young adults,\u201d Paul said. \u201cWe\u2019re with kids all day, every day, and they\u2019re watching our games, and we have an influence, so we have an opportunity to use our voice.\u201d\n\nWhile California\u2019s Affordable Care Act site is producing smooth results, the federal government\u2019s healthcare website remains riddled with breakdowns and malfunctions.\n\n\u201cNobody is madder than me about the fact that the website isn\u2019t working as well as it should, which means it\u2019s going to get fixed,\u201d President Obama said in Washington, D.C.\n\nMeanwhile, in California, some consumers report that they have received notices from their health insurance providers, stating that, due to the Affordable Care Act, their new policies will run hundreds of dollars more per month than what they are paying now.\n\n\u201cI felt duped, because the President kept saying, \u2018If you like your plan, you can keep your plan, your premiums will be going down,'\u201d one California resident said. \u201cAnd my premium is going up by 40 percent.\u201d\n\n_____________________________________________\n\nFor helpful information about health reform and the Affordable Care
