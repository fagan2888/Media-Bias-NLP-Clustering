The vote is generating a public fight between competing hospitals.\n\nIn Brevard County, Health First dominates: They own the largest hospital system, physicians and outpatient center. They also own the for-profit insurance company Health First Health Plans.\n\nCounty officials are voting on who will provide insurance to their 8,700 employees and family members.\n\nA committee recommended Brevard County pick a combination of Cigna and Health First Health Plans for the $56 million contract. Parrish Medical Center competes with Health First hospitals, and its CEO thinks going with Health First is a mistake.\n\nGeorge Mikitarian wrote a letter to county commissioners, pointing to ongoing antitrust lawsuits against Health First.\n\n\u201cAll they do is push you to a Health First facility,\u201d Mikitarian said in an interview. \u201cAnd all of their facilities are far more expensive than other facilities in the community.\u201d\n\nMatthew Gerrell is vice president of marketing for Health First.vHe says the letter has been a distraction.\n\n\u201cThe committee\u2019s recommendation is the right one,\u201d Gerrell said. \u201cMr. Mikitarian obviously has a differing opinion to the committee, but we believe the committee made the right choice.\u201d\n\nCounty officials vote today on the contract.
