Danforth Center on Religion and Politics opens its fall lecture series Thursday, Sept. 10, with a talk on \u201cObamacare and American Values.\u201d\n\nDavid M. Craig, PhD, associate professor and chair of the religious studies department at Indiana University-Purdue University in Indianapolis, will deliver the first lecture in the four-part series at 4:30 p.m. in Umrath Lounge on the Danforth campus.\n\nCraig is a religious ethicist specializing in economic, environmental and health care ethics. His recent book, \u201cHealth Care as a Social Good: Religious Values and American Democracy\u201d (Georgetown University Press, 2014), evaluates health care access, delivery and finance in the United States. Craig\u2019s research with conservatives, liberals and moderates to review their ideas for market reform or support for the Affordable Care Act led him to see health care in the U.S. not as a private good or a public good, but as a shared social good.\n\nOrganized by Leigh Eric Schmidt, PhD, the Edward Mallinckrodt Distinguished University Professor at Washington University, the lecture series is free and open to the public and RSVPs are appreciated. For more information, visit the Danforth Center website, call 314-935-9345 or email rap@wustl.edu.\n\n\u201cSome of the most pressing political questions of our time occur at points where religion, medicine, and the law intersect,\u201d said Marie Griffith, PhD, the John C. Danforth Distinguished Professor in the Humanities and director of the John C. Danforth Center on Religion and Politics. \u201cWe are grateful to Professor Leigh Schmidt for\n\ndeveloping this lecture series, which examines a range of important\n\ntopics in this area and aims to inform the often heated discussions\n\nsurrounding them.\u201d\n\nOther lectures in the series include:\n\nThursday, Oct. 8\n\n\u201cPaging God: Religion in the Halls of Medicine,\u201d by Wendy Cadge, PhD, professor of sociology and women\u2019s, gender, and sexuality studies at Brandeis University.\n\nHer lecture, which shares the same title as her 2012 book, will analyze how religion and spirituality are present and negotiated by physicians, nurses, chaplains and other health care workers in large academic hospitals.\n\nTuesday, Nov. 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Faith Community\u2019s Role in Health Care,\u201d by G. Scott Morris, MD, the founder and CEO of the Church Health Center (CHC) in Memphis, Tennessee.\n\nMorris will discuss the church\u2019s mission to reclaim the biblical commitment to care for our bodies and spirits. His CHC health care ministry provides primary health care to over 65,000 patients in its clinic, many of whom are low-income, uninsured working people.\n\nTuesday, Dec. 1\n\n\u201cOn Transparency: Christian Drug Rehabilitation Centers in Guatemala,\u201d by Kevin Lewis O\u2019Neill, PhD, associate professor in the department for the study of religion and the Centre for Diaspora and Transnational Studies at University of Toronto.\n\nO\u2019Neill\u2019s ethnographic work examines the moral dimensions of contemporary political practice. His most recent book, \u201cSecure the Soul: Christian Piety and Gang Prevention in Guatemala\u201d (University of California Press, 2015), tracks Christian piety\u2019s entanglement with Central American security.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#a51417", "application-name": "Washington University in St. Louis", "og": {"site_name": "The Source", "description": "Issues at the crossroads of religion, medicine and law will be the focus as the John C.
