By Sunday, the trailer was gone.\n\n\"I would love to get it back in one piece,\" White said.\n\nThe stolen trailer contained a generator and air compressor. Luckily, the band's instruments and sound equipment were not inside.\n\n\"Some stuff is irreplaceable,\" White said. \"The blood, sweat and tears behind the equipment.\"\n\nWhite assumed he would never see the trailer again, but as he drove to lunch Thursday, a truck pulling his trailer turned in front of him at Harry and West. The pickup headed east on Harry. White decided to follow and call 911.\n\nHe described the trailer and the truck pulling it to a 911 operator as he continued to follow it. The driver stopped at a scrap yard at Harry and Orient.\n\nAs White waited for police to show up, the dispatcher urged him not to get involved.\n\n\"I don't want you to do anything that's going to place yourself in any danger,\" the female dispatcher said.\n\nWhite waited in his car, keeping an eye on the suspect's truck.\n\n\"He was walking back to his truck and an officer did pull up,\" White said. \"Then another officer pulled up behind him and he jumped back in his truck and took off.\"\n\nThe dispatcher told White not to follow the police pursuit.\n\nThat pursuit reached speeds of 70 miles per hour, so it was called off. The suspect got away with the trailer. However, White hopes it will turn up again.\n\n\"Let's keep our eyes open because he's probably still out there somewhere,\" he said.\n\nAnybody who knows where the trailer is should call Wichita Police or Crimestoppers at 267-2111.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "A woman and her neighbor noticed the trailer sitting outside their homes, which had been there since Thursday afternoon.", "language": "english", "author": "Phil White", "og": {"description": "A woman and her neighbor noticed the trailer sitting outside their homes, which had been there since Thursday afternoon.", "title": "UPDATE: Wichita man's stolen trailer found, returned", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Man-spots-his-stolen-trailer-suspect-runs-from-police-245643701.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/iupl/EF3/866/EF38662F829E4FF3A7657A7B285BFBFA", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/B80/EC6/B80EC60F3E30448E80DA16F0D3233016.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "A woman and her neighbor noticed the trailer sitting outside their homes, which had been there since Thursday afternoon.", "title": "UPDATE: Wichita man's stolen trailer found, returned", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Man-spots-his-stolen-trailer-suspect-runs-from-police-245643701.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/StolenTrailerWeb.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "UPDATE: Wichita man's stolen trailer found, returned", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "UPDATE Wichita mans stolen trailer, found"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9359\"", "article_summary": "Neither of them knew whom it belonged to until they saw social media posts about the stolen trailer.\nAfter KAKE News aired his story Friday evening, a Wichita man whose trailer was stolen last weekend says it was found and returned to him in one piece.\nThe stolen trailer contained a generator and air compressor.\nA Wichita man is still hoping to find a trailer that was stolen from him last weekend.\nA he drove to lunch Thursday, a truck pulling his trailer turned in front of him at Harry and West."}
