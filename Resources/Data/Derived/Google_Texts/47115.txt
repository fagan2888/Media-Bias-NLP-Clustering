Police have arrested a woman who, earlier this year, allegedly tried to shoplift from a Wichita department store then ran, leaving her young grandson behind.

On June 16, employees saw a woman trying to steal clothing at Kohl's, located at 6900 West Kellogg. When they confronted her, police say she returned the $200 worth of merchandise, then ran from the store.

Police say she left her five-year-old grandson behind. He was placed in foster care after no one showed up to a custody hearing to claim him.

The 41-year-old woman, identified as Kathleen Williams, was arrested Friday. She faces charges of child abandonment, theft of property after priors and two probation violations. Williams has two prior felony convictions.

Williams' grandson remains in foster care.
