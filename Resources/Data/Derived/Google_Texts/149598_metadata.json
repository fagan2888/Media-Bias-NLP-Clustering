Jakes told worshippers at The Potter\u2019s House Church in Dallas that black men should not be \u201ctried on the sidewalk.\u201d At Ebenezer AME Church in Fort Washington, Maryland, choir members sang \u201cWe Shall Overcome\u201d for worshippers wearing T-shirts that read \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d and \u201cI Can\u2019t Breathe.\u201d Men at the West Angeles Church of God in Christ in Los Angeles stood more than four rows deep around the altar for a special blessing and message from the pastor, Presiding Bishop Charles E. Blake.\n\n\u201cPolice forces are charged with protecting all our citizens,\u201d said Blake, leader of the national Church of God in Christ, the largest black Pentecostal group in the U.S. \u201cIn a very special way, they are to abide by the laws they are called to enforce. They should not bring fear to our citizens, but rather confidence.\u201d\n\nThe churches were responding to a call from several historically African-American denominations for what they called \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d Sunday, in response to the recent police slayings of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and Eric Garner in New York. The church actions came a day after marches and demonstrations by civil rights and other groups around the country pressing for changes to the criminal justice system.\n\n\u201cIt is a time to hear God calling us to be relevant and responsive to the needs of people with us and around us,\u201d wrote Senior Bishop Lawrence Reddick of the Christian Methodist Episcopal Church, an organizer of Sunday\u2019s church action.\n\nAt morning services, the Rev. Lee P. Washington, pastor at Reid Temple AME Church in Glenn Dale, Maryland, called black clothing \u201cserious dress for serious times.\u201d He said those who contend that the black men who were killed by officers \u201cdeserve what they got\u201d for disobeying police, or whose deaths were nothing more than an \u201cunfortunate tragedy,\u201d should think about the impact of the deaths on grieving families.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Black churches pray in protest of police slayings", "title": "Black churches pray in protest of police slayings", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Black churches pray in protest of police slayings", "title": "Black churches pray in protest of police slayings", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/12/14/black_churches_pray_in_protest_of_police_slayings/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/aptopix-killings-by-police.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Black churches pray in protest of police slayings", "title": "Black churches pray in protest of police slayings", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/aptopix-killings-by-police.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Rachel Zoll", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: From the Wires, NewsNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Congregants in African-American churches across the country wore black to Sunday services and prayed over the men in attendance in a symbolic stand against fatal police shootings of unarmed black men.\nThey should not bring fear to our citizens, but rather confidence.\u201dThe churches were responding to a call from several historically African-American denominations for what they called \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d Sunday, in response to the recent police slayings of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and Eric Garner in New York.\nThe church actions came a day after marches and demonstrations by civil rights and other groups around the country pressing for changes to the criminal justice system.\nAt morning services, the Rev.\n\u201cPolice forces are charged with protecting all our citizens,\u201d said Blake, leader of the national Church of God in Christ, the largest black Pentecostal group in the U.S. \u201cIn a very special way, they are to abide by the laws they are called to enforce."}
