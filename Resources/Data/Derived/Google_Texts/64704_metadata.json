Exit polls reported by Russian news outlets said 93% of voters supported moving the region\u2019s allegiance to Moscow from Kiev.\n\nThe U.S. and the E.U. reiterated their position that the referendum violates both Ukraine\u2019s constitution and international principles, and they attacked Russia for its military intervention.\n\nThe U.S. statement called on the international community to \u201ctake concrete steps to impose costs,\u201d while the European statement said officials in Brussels would meet Monday to \u201cdecide on additional measures.\u201d\n\nOfficials have paved the way for targeted, individual sanctions against Russians who played a role in the military intervention in Ukraine and related events this year.\n\nHere are the full statements.\n\nStatement by the White House Press Secretary Jay Carney on Ukraine:\n\nThe United States has steadfastly supported the independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of Ukraine since it declared its independence in 1991, and we reject the \u201creferendum\u201d that took place today in the Crimean region of Ukraine. This referendum is contrary to Ukraine\u2019s constitution, and the international community will not recognize the results of a poll administered under threats of violence and intimidation from a Russian military intervention that violates international law.\n\nNo decisions should be made about the future of Ukraine without the Ukrainian government. Moreover, this vote was not necessary. The Ukrainian government has made clear its willingness to discuss increased autonomy for Crimea, and the presidential elections planned for May 25 provide a legitimate opportunity for all Ukrainians to make their voices heard on the future of their country.\n\nIn addition, Ukraine, the United States, the EU, the OSCE, the U.N., and others have called for Russia to allow international monitors into the Crimean peninsula to ensure that the rights of ethnic Russians in Ukraine are being upheld. Russia has spurned those calls as well as outreach from the Ukrainian government and instead has escalated its military intervention into Crimea and initiated threatening military exercises on Ukraine\u2019s eastern border.\n\nRussia\u2019s actions are dangerous and destabilizing. The U.N. Security Council recognized this in a vote yesterday that only Russia opposed. As the United States and our allies have made clear, military intervention and violation of international law will bring increasing costs for Russia\u2013not only due to measures imposed by the United States and our allies but also as a direct result of Russia\u2019s own destabilizing actions.\n\nIn this century, we are long past the days when the international community will stand quietly by while one country forcibly seizes the territory of another. We call on all members of the international community to continue to condemn such actions, to take concrete steps to impose costs, and to stand together in support of the Ukrainian people and Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity and sovereignty.\n\nJoint statement by President of the European Council Herman Van Rompuy and President of the European Commission Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso on Crimea:\n\nBrussels, 16 March 2014 \u2013 As stated by all 28 EU Heads of State or Government on 6 March 2014, the European Union considers the holding of the referendum on the future status of the territory of Ukraine as contrary to the Ukrainian Constitution and international law. The referendum is illegal and illegitimate and its outcome will not be recognised.\n\nThe solution to the crisis in Ukraine must be based on the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine, in the framework of the Ukrainian Constitution as well as the strict adherence to international standards. Only working together through diplomatic processes, including direct discussions between the Governments of Ukraine and Russia, can we find a solution to the crisis. The European Union has a special responsibility for peace, stability and prosperity on the European continent and will continue pursuing these objectives using all available channels.\n\nWe reiterate the strong condemnation of the unprovoked violation of Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity and call on Russia to withdraw its armed forces to their precrisis numbers and the areas of their permanent stationing, in accordance with relevant agreements.\n\nIn advancing these goals, the Ministers of Foreign Affairs will evaluate the situation tomorrow in Brussels and decide on additional measures in line with the declaration of the Heads of State and Government of the EU of 6 March.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "The U.S. and the European Union on Sunday immediately rejected the results of Crimea\u2019s referendum, saying the international community should respond with concrete measures against Russia for its actions in Ukraine.", "title": "U.S., EU Reject Crimea Referendum Results", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2014/03/16/u-s-eu-reject-crimea-referendum-results/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "WSJPolitics", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Politics", "article.headline": "U.S., EU Reject Crimea Referendum Results", "description": "The U.S. and the European Union on Sunday immediately rejected the results of Crimea\u2019s referendum, saying the international community should respond with concrete measures against Russia for its actions in Ukraine.", "article_section": "Politics", "author": "William Mauldin", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Washington Wire Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Washington Wire", "article.summary": "The U.S. and the European Union on Sunday immediately rejected the results of Crimea\u2019s referendum, saying the international community should respond with concrete measures against Russia for its actions in Ukraine.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-03-16T19:14:00-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-143", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2014/03/16/u-s-eu-reject-crimea-referendum-results/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-WB-44168", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Politics", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "The U.S. and the European Union on Sunday immediately rejected the results of Crimea\u2019s referendum, saying the international community should respond with concrete measures against Russia for its actions in Ukraine.", "title": "U.S., EU Reject Crimea Referendum Results", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2014/03/16/u-s-eu-reject-crimea-referendum-results/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Washington Wire", "article.id": "BL-WB-44168", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-03-16T19:15:49-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1ccf\"", "article_summary": "reiterated their position that the referendum violates both Ukraine\u2019s constitution and international principles, and they attacked Russia for its military intervention.\nIn this century, we are long past the days when the international community will stand quietly by while one country forcibly seizes the territory of another.\nThe U.S. and the European Union on Sunday immediately rejected the results of Crimea\u2019s referendum, saying the international community should respond with concrete measures against Russia for its actions in Ukraine.\nThis referendum is contrary to Ukraine\u2019s constitution, and the international community will not recognize the results of a poll administered under threats of violence and intimidation from a Russian military intervention that violates international law.\nExit polls reported by Russian news outlets said 93% of voters supported moving the region\u2019s allegiance to Moscow from Kiev."}
