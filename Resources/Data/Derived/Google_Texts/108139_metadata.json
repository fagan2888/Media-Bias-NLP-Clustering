It\u2019s so predictable.\u201d\n\nYes, he said this during the administration of the first black president, during a campaign that pits the first major party female candidate against a reality TV star who is winning his party\u2019s nomination against the party leaders\u2019 wills and while running a fascism-reminiscient campaign. But what we really need to get out of the doldrums is for a liberal Democrat to pick a running mate that stands against everything she and her party stand for.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that Matthews wallowed in this bizarre fantasy. Part of what\u2019s motivating him is likely the Beltway media idealization of bipartisanship that rests on this asinine idea that political differences between the parties are minor issues that hardly matter at all. But I\u2019d also venture that part of what makes Matthews go back to this well over and over again is his well-documented history of having major anxiety in the face of female power.\n\nMatthews has chilled out a bit in recent years, but it\u2019s easy to see why the idea of pairing Clinton off with Kasich, an avuncular sexist who talks at women like they are children, might have some subconscious appeal. It might seem like the way to contain her, keep her in line, make sure that she\u2019s still kowtowing to a sexist establishment even as she vies for the highest office in the land. To a certain kind of man, Kasich feels like the kind of man you want to babysit the female president, on the grounds that she can\u2019t be trusted to run things on her own. (It just so happens that this notion that women can\u2019t be trusted fuels Kasich\u2019s war on reproductive rights, as well.)\n\nIn general, Tuesday night was ugly reminder of how many men\u2019s reaction to female power is to look for ways to contain and control women. Clinton\u2019s massive sweep of primaries was met met by a bunch of men \u2014 and a few women \u2014 rushing forward to put Clinton in her place, to remind her that no matter how high an office she holds, her first duty, as a woman, is to soothe and placate the most delicate of male egos.\n\nSmile. You just had a big night. #PrimaryDay \u2014 Joe Scarborough (@JoeNBC) March 16, 2016\n\nHillary shouting her speech. She has the floor; a more conversational tone might be better for connecting with folks at home \u2014 HowardKurtz (@HowardKurtz) March 16, 2016\n\nHillary having a big night in the primaries. So she\u2019s shouting angrily in her victory speech. Supporters loving it. What\u2019s she mad at? \u2014 Brit Hume (@brithume) March 16, 2016\n\nThat\u2019s the bad news. But there is good news to be scratched out of this shameful display of manhood so fragile that it shatters the second woman speaks above a whisper or offers anything but a please-don\u2019t-hurt-me smile: The sexism was called out, unapologetically and unguardedly, right away.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Instructions to Clinton to smile more or pick Kasich as her VP are just sexism disguised as advice", "title": "Stop \u201chelping\u201d Hillary: Sorry, guys, but Clinton doesn\u2019t need to smile, whisper, or have John Kasich as her running mate", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Instructions to Clinton to smile more or pick Kasich as her VP are just sexism disguised as advice", "title": "Stop \u201chelping\u201d Hillary: Sorry, guys, but Clinton doesn\u2019t need to smile, whisper, or have John Kasich as her running mate", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/03/16/stop_helping_hillary_sorry_guys_but_clinton_doesnt_need_to_smile_whisper_or_have_john_kasich_as_her_running_mate/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/02/dem-2016-clinton.jpeg59-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Instructions to Clinton to smile more or pick Kasich as her VP are just sexism disguised as advice", "title": "Stop \u201chelping\u201d Hillary: Sorry, guys, but Clinton doesn\u2019t need to smile, whisper, or have John Kasich as her running mate", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/02/dem-2016-clinton.jpeg59-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@AmandaMarcotte", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Amanda Marcotte", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Brit Hume, Chris Matthews, Democratic primary, Elections 2016, Hillary Clinton, Howard Kurtz, Joe Scarborough, John Kasich, Sexual Harassment, women's voices", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fded9f\"", "article_summary": "\u201cOf course, this doesn\u2019t happen in American politics,\u201d he added wistfully, \u201cbecause American politics is so free of wonder anymore.\n(It just so happens that this notion that women can\u2019t be trusted fuels Kasich\u2019s war on reproductive rights, as well.)\nBut what we really need to get out of the doldrums is for a liberal Democrat to pick a running mate that stands against everything she and her party stand for.\nIn general, Tuesday night was ugly reminder of how many men\u2019s reaction to female power is to look for ways to contain and control women.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that Matthews wallowed in this bizarre fantasy."}
