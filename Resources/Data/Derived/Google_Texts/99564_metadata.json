If the woman was raped, if it is a case of incest, if the mother\u2019s life is in danger it simply does not matter. Most recently, Carson has drawn an epic comparison between women who have chosen to undergo an abortion and slave owners whom he said \u201cthought that they had the right to do whatever they wanted to that slave\u2014anything that they chose to do.\u201d\n\nThe comparison he draws between African-American slaves and unborn fetuses has a number of ethical and moral implications and no true base in logic or reason.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve allowed the purveyors of the vision to make mothers think that that baby is their enemy and they have the right to kill it,\u201d Carson said.\n\nBut the argument that women see babies as an enemy is an unfair one to make. It ignores that there are situations in which a mother knows she realistically would not be able to provide for a child, either financially or emotionally. This violent image Carson creates between mother and fetus disregards circumstance and instead overgeneralizes a profoundly sensitive women\u2019s issue. These kinds of comments are rooted firmly in ignorance and we have seen time and time again from the mouth of conservative Republicans, but Carson has enraptured the media with his uniquely intolerant take on the issues.\n\nNevertheless, \u201cif you had to win a popularity and a likability contest he would probably come out on top,\u201d Fox News host Neil Cavuto said of GOP presidential hopeful Carson. Carson is a renaissance man. He has mastered pediatric neurosurgery, insensitive references to the Holocaust and a general disregard of women\u2019s rights to their bodies throughout his career.\n\nThese recent statements comparing pro-choice women to slave owners adds to the problematic discourse and opinions Carson has brought to the highly broadcasted political platform.\n\nThis is not his first reference to slavery. He also referred to Obamacare as \u201cthe worst thing to happen to our country since slavery\u201d in 2013.\n\nReferences to the Holocaust are also abundant in Carson\u2019s political discourse. When discussing the issue of gun control after the recent shooting at a community college in Oregon, Carson said \u201cthe likelihood of Hitler being able to accomplish his goals would have been greatly diminished if the people had been armed.\u201d\n\nOn defending the use of the Confederate flag, Carson said \u201cswastikas are a symbol of hate for some people, too. And yet they still exist in museums.\u201d\n\nCarson broadcasts a healthy amount of prejudice, as proven when asked about the potential of a Muslim becoming president.\n\n\u201cI certainly hope it never happens,\u201d Carson said. \u201cAnd I certainly wouldn\u2019t want to do anything to facilitate changing America to something else.\u201d\n\nThese statements all disregard the historical and daily struggles of a variety of racial, social and religious groups. Specifically, most detrimental is his attack on Planned Parenthood and by extension women\u2019s access to safe abortions, affordable birth control and STD testing.\n\nCarson believes that abortion should be illegal, \u201ceven in cases of rape and incest\u201d on the grounds that he \u201cwould not be in favor of killing a baby because the baby came about in that way.\u201d\n\nHis views support the belief that life begins at the moment of conception and therefore \u201cinnocent life must be protected.\u201d Over the years, he has donated to a wide spectrum of faith-based entities in order to preserve his oath of protecting life. The only validity to these points is their alignment with his religious beliefs, which can be interpreted as a violation of the separation of church and state, as discussed in the US Constitution. These should have no place in his intentions as a potential president. Discussing the morality of abortions is generally weaved with religious views on abortion. Roger Rosenblatt, a writer and essayist for TIME, confronted the issue of religious text in American government in his essay \u201cHow to End the Abortion War.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmericans are moral worriers,\u201d Rosenblatt said. \u201cWe tend to treat every political dispute that arises as a test of our national soul. The smallest incident, like the burning of the flag, can bring our hidden religion to the surface. The largest and most complex moral problem, like abortion, can confound it for decades.\u201d\n\nBut this vastly oversimplified connection between abortion and Planned Parenthood is what has fueled pro-life activists to defund Planned Parenthood. Their argument stems from the idea that their religious beliefs are being degraded through funding abortion through taxpayer\u2019s dollars. In reality, abortion services make up only 3 percent of total Planned Parenthood services, which is minor compared to the 42 percent that goes toward STI/STD Testing and Treatment.\n\nCarson supports plans to defund Planned Parenthood under the claim that he \u201cknows who Margret Sanger is.\u201d He said she was a racist eugenicist who premeditated Planned Parenthood\u2019s \u201cclinics in black neighborhoods\u201d as a way to \u201cfind a way to control the population,\u201d Carson said.\n\nMargret Sanger was a birth control activist, sex educator and founder of Planned Parenthood. Incriminating documents have come out linking Sanger to eugenics and racist ideology, asking the public to \u201csee what many people in Nazi Germany thought about her,\u201d Carson said.\n\nMost all these claims are falsely quoted, misread and due to the outdated nature of her work published in the early 20th century. In reality, Sanger was utilizing the popularity of pre-Nazi eugenic ideology to further her cause.\n\n\u201cMany historians now believe that Sanger opposed eugenics along racial lines,\u201d according to the PBS feature \u201cThe Pill.\u201d \u201cFurthermore, Sanger opposed the belief of many eugenicists that poverty was hereditary, asserting instead that poverty, criminal behavior and other social problems were due to environmental factors and were not predetermined.\u201d\n\nCarson\u2019s extremist views are not representative of the Republican Party as a whole but are instead a warped version conservative values. To overgeneralize Planned Parenthood as a means of controlling minority population and murdering fetuses funded through taxpayers dollars is not only unfounded factually, but harmful to the rights of all humans. His political rhetoric targets vulnerable women outright, but its implications expand much further than that. To use religion as a force of violence against others entirely discredits the doctrines wrapped up in empathy and compassion fundamental to that religion. The severity of his words do not allow for dialog or sympathy, instead takes pro-life ideas to a violent extreme.
