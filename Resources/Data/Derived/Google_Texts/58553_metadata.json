Knee arthritis, in particular, is more common and severe in older women, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nLu called the study, which was funded by the U.S. National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, the \u201clargest to investigate the impact of dairy intake on the progression of knee osteoarthritis.\u201d\n\nAs he told Reuters, \u201cMilk is an excellent source of vitamins and minerals, dairy calcium and protein, and has long been recognized for its important role in bone health,\u201d which is why researchers hypothesized that it could slow the progression of knee arthritis.\n\nBeginning in 2002, researchers looked at 1,260 women and nearly 900 men in their early 60s who had knee arthritis and provided information about their dietary habits, including milk consumption.\n\nResearchers used X-rays of the participants\u2019 knees to measure the space between bones in the joint that would indicate the progression of the disease. Participants\u2019 knees were checked at the start of the study and again 12, 24, 36 and 48 months later.\n\nMore than 90 percent of those in the study drank either fat-free or low-fat milk. Researchers compared those who drank no milk, fewer than three glasses a week, four to six glasses a week, and more than seven glasses a week. They found that drinking up to six glasses a week had the most impact in slowing progression of the disease in women, but had no such effect in men.\n\n>> Get discounts on health services with your AARP Member Advantages.\n\nOther dairy products did not have the same benefits. Yogurt consumption seemed to have no effect on joint deterioration, while women who ate more cheese had faster deterioration.\n\nThe researchers acknowledged in the study, which was published online April 7 in Arthritis Care & Research, that they didn\u2019t determine a cause-and-effect reason for their findings, merely an association. They did adjust the data to take into account other possible risk factors for osteoarthritis, including smoking and obesity.\n\nAs to whether people with osteoarthritis should drink milk, the New York Times reported that Lu had a simple answer: \u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cLow-fat or fat-free milk.\u201d\n\nPhoto: GlobalStock/iStock\n\nAlso of Interest\n\nSee the AARP home page for deals, savings tips, trivia and more", "article_metadata": {"page_title": "blog", "twitter": {"description": "Women who drank up to six glasses of low-fat or fat-free milk a week delayed the effects of arthritis in their knees, a large new study finds.
