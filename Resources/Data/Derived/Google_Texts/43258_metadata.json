This is interesting, mostly because we assume that heart disease has risen significantly in the modern age due to super-sized fast food meals, the obesity epidemic, and lack of preventive medicine in the health care system. You wouldn\u2019t think that our rough-and-tumble ancestors, who trekked across glaciers and hunted to survive, would have a heart disease risk similar to the current couch-potato human\u2019s. The study, however, shows that \u00d6tzi indeed had hardened arteries \u2014 even though he never smoked, drank huge Coca-Colas, or ate Big Macs in front of the TV screen.\n\n\u201cWe were very surprised that he had a very strong disposition for cardiovascular disease,\u201d Albert Zink, an author of the study who is also a paleopathologist at the Institute for Mummies and the Iceman at the European Academy of Bozen/Bolzano, Italy, told Fox News. \u201cWe didn\u2019t expect that people who lived so long ago already had the genetic setup for getting such kinds of diseases.\u201d They concluded that a person\u2019s genetic risk for hardening of the arteries \u2014 known as atherosclerosis \u2014 was the same thousands of years ago as it is today.\n\nThe researchers were able to identify the Ice Man\u2019s hardened arteries through CT scans that showed \u201cevidence of calcium deposits associated with atherosclerotic plaques in the arteries of mummies as old as 5,000 years,\u201d the authors said in a press release, according to HealthDay. \u201cEven though our human ancestors lived far different lives than we do, their environments and lifestyles were not protecting them against the development of atherosclerosis.\u201d The Ice Man in particular had a genetic mutation that\u2019s one of the greatest predictors of heart attacks.\n\nThough other ancient mummies have shown signs of clogged arteries, the Ice Man is the first and only ancient human that has shown a genetic predisposition for heart disease. The study doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that the Ice Man and his kin were partaking in unhealthy lifestyles that are known to cause heart disease (poor eating habits and inactivity), but rather simply that the genes causing heart disease were nearly the same back then as they are now. Does this mean that genetics play a more important role in heart disease than previously believed? Zink says it\u2019s possible, but further research comparing and contrasting other genes of ancient mummies would have to be carried out to come to a conclusion.\n\nIf you\u2019re at risk for heart disease \u2014 whether it\u2019s your genes or lifestyle triggering it \u2014 you shouldn\u2019t let this stop you from changing your lifestyle. Smoking, high levels of LDL or \u201cbad\u201d cholesterol, lack of exercise, diabetes, and obesity are all huge risk factors for heart disease (and are all preventable). Changing your lifestyle could have a significant impact on your cardiovascular health.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "ice man, otzi, heart disease", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "After examining the arteries of a man who lived 5,300 years ago, and who was preserved in the ice on the Alps, researchers discovered that he may have had a genetic risk of heart disease.", "title": "The \u2018Ice Man\u2019 Mummy Had Hardened Arteries; Was It Heart Disease?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/infamous-ice-man-mummy-had-hardened-arteries-may-have-been-risk-heart-disease-296216", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/02/alps.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "After examining the arteries of a man who lived 5,300 years ago, and who was preserved in the ice on the Alps, researchers discovered that he may have had a genetic risk of heart disease.", "title": "The \u2018Ice Man\u2019 Mummy Had Hardened Arteries; Was It Heart Disease?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/infamous-ice-man-mummy-had-hardened-arteries-may-have-been-risk-heart-disease-296216", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/02/alps.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/02/alps.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Science/Tech", "published_time": "2014-08-02T15:06:09-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-02T15:06:08-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "After examining the arteries of a man who lived 5,300 years ago, and who was preserved in the ice on the Alps, researchers discovered that he may have had a genetic risk of heart disease."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb464\"", "article_summary": "You wouldn\u2019t think that our rough-and-tumble ancestors, who trekked across glaciers and hunted to survive, would have a heart disease risk similar to the current couch-potato human\u2019s.\nDoes this mean that genetics play a more important role in heart disease than previously believed?\nYou may remember the creepy skeletal prehistoric guy you learned about in elementary school, a preserved mummy discovered in the snowy Alps known as the \u201cIce Man,\u201d or \u00d6tzi.\nA new study now says that the man, who lived around 5,300 years ago, might have had a genetic predisposition to heart disease.\nIf you\u2019re at risk for heart disease \u2014 whether it\u2019s your genes or lifestyle triggering it \u2014 you shouldn\u2019t let this stop you from changing your lifestyle."}
