A Ponca City couple can't believe its good fortune.

The Blakes threw a message in a bottle from a cruise ship near Grenada on their 40th wedding anniversary on April 1, 2012.

"It had basic information," Paula Blake said.

The bottle took almost exactly two years to travel around 2300 miles and was found in Rutherford Beach, Louisiana just days before the Blakes' 42nd anniversary.

Eight-year-old Heidi Watts made the discovery on vacation with her family, which contacted the Blakes with a happy anniversary card.

"We were shocked, couldn't believe it," Jim Blake said.

"I was screaming 'Oh my God, look she found it,'" Paula Blake said about Heidi's card, which was postmarked April 1st, 2014.

The Blakes have been talking with the Watts family, which lives in Missouri.

The Blakes are already planning a trip to Missouri this summer and hope to meet Heidi so they can thank her in person.
