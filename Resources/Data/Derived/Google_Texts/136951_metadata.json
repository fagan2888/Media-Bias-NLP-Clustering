One biography of Trump says he supported Bush over Kerry.\n\nTrump was also critical of both Kerry and Bush. He said the Iraq War was a mess for Bush, but also praised Bush for effectively spinning Kerry\u2019s war record as a negative.\n\nHere\u2019s the evidence we collected of Trump\u2019s position on the 2004 presidential campaign:", "article_metadata": {"bf": {"buzzid": 4173521, "userid": 2870875}, "google-signin-clientid": "895639880237-tcoheof19odpd88p676rjc70v0iqit0o.apps.googleusercontent.com", "description": "And some evidence to the contrary...", "copyright": "Copyright 2016 BuzzFeed, Inc.
