On November 29, 1864, Cheyenne Chief White Antelope sang his death song as some 200 Arapaho and Cheyenne were massacred by Colorado Volunteers of the U.S. Army at Sand Creek in southeastern Colorado Territory. The Indians had been promised safety by the military and some even gathered futilely under the Stars and Stripes hoisted at the encampment above a white flag of peace.

This year marks the 150th anniversary of the Sand Creek Massacre—an anniversary that will be memorialized with a number of events at the National Historic Site in Kiowa County, Colorado.

Join park staff on Independence Day as they lead two events. At 10 a.m., rangers will lead a guided tour of the Sand Creek site, followed by a 2 p.m. program on the Memorial Hill where interpreters will speak about the events of November 29, 1864.

According to a press release from the National Park Service, entrance to the park is free and gates open at 9 a.m. The visitor contact station has water and restrooms.

Visitors can expect to walk one mile over sandy and uneven terrain while on the tour—dress appropriately and wear comfortable shoes.
