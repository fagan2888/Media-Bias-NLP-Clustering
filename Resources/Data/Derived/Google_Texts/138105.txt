A fire late Saturday morning destroyed an abandoned school in Reno County.

Crews were called just before 11 a.m. to the old middle school in the 300 block of North Howard Street.

A KAKE viewer said a brush fire spread to the school, and it was fully engulfed when firefighters arrived on scene.

No one was hurt in the fire, but dispatchers said the building is a total loss.
