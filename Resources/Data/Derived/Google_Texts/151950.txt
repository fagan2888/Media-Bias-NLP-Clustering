The Coromandel Peninsula in New Zealand.

A YOUNG Brisbane woman has died days after falling from a ledge at The Coromandel in New Zealand.

Ashleigh Dargusch, 23, was walking along the famous North Island, New Zealand, peninsula when she fell and hit her head on Boxing Day.

She was airlifted to Waikato hospital but she died over the weekend.

Her workplace, Alpha Physiotherapy, paid tribute to the young woman, saying they had a “heavy heart”.

“She was an extremely valuable member of our staff and will be greatly missed,” they shared on social media.

“Our thoughts are with her boyfriend Jared and her family during this difficult time.”

Waikato District Command Centre Senior Sergeant Rupert Friend said Miss Dargusch and four friends had been walking along the Kaueranga Valley Track to a watering hole on December 26 when the incident occurred.

“Standing 5-7 metres above the hole on a ledge she was described as watching two friends jumping into the water when she appears to have lost her footing and fallen on to a large slate of rock below suffering critical injuries,” he said.

Mr Friend said the injured woman was flown by rescue helicopter to Waikato Hospital’s Emergency Department and from there she was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit where she died a week later.

“At this point in time I would like to extend the New Zealand Police’s sympathies to her family and friends for their loss.”
