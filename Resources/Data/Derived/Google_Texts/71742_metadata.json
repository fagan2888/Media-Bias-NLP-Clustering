Parker Center at Etowah Park on Wednesday to get free tax-filing help from AARP volunteers.\n\nProgram coordinator Gordon Leiter said most of the clients are senior citizens but the free service is available to anyone.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t turn anyone away, whatever their age, whatever their income,\u201d Leiter said.\n\nWhat: Free AARP tax-filing service\n\nWhen: Mondays from 1 to 4 p.m. and Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. at the Rome-Floyd County Library, 205 Riverside Parkway; Wednesdays from 1 to 4 p.m. at the Charles C. Parker Center, Etowah Park.\n\nLeiter said the 10 volunteers who prepare the tax returns get a week of training in January each year. Leiter said much of the training involved the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act because it caused a lot of trouble last year.\n\n\u201cThe IRS sent several people and said \u2018have another look at this, you may have gotten overcharged,\u201d\u2019 Leiter said.\n\nThere are some returns the volunteers cannot work on. The AARP volunteers cannot help anyone with rental income because of the depreciation.\n\n\u201cWe did it for years so that\u2019s kind of frustrating,\u201d Leiter said.\n\nJack Summerbell, a retired teacher at Darling\u00adton School, has been a volunteer with the program for several years.\n\n\u201cI love to do it. You meet interesting people and, of course, you\u2019re really helping them out,\u201d Summerbell said.\n\nBarbara Broadway Henderson, retired from Berry College, said she has been taking advantage of the free AARP service for the last five or six years.\n\n\u201cI know how to do lots of things but I don\u2019t know how to do accounting,\u201d Henderson said. \u201cIt\u2019s just my Social Security and Berry College retirement, so I let them do it every year. They are very good and I\u2019ve never had an error made.\u201d\n\nThe system used by the AARP volunteers is designed to minimize the chance of errors. After the taxpayer fills out some basic paperwork, they are paired with an aide who does the return. Once it is completed, it is double-checked by another aide before it is submitted to the government.\n\nLeiter also said his crew can only handle state returns for Georgia, Alabama and South Carolina.\n\nLast year, 10 AARP volunteers in Rome helped more than 1,200 taxpayers file state and federal returns.\n\nMost of them were filed electronically, Leiter said.\n\nTaxpayers who have their refunds directly deposited into a bank account often get their money back in as little as a week, Leiter said.\n\nThe service is available Mondays from 1 to 4 p.m. at the Rome-Floyd County Library, 205 Riverside Parkway; Wednesdays from 1 to 4 p.m. at the Charles C. Parker Center; and Saturdays back at the library from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Northwest Georgia News", "description": "A steady stream of senior citizens flowed into the Charles C.
