Her parents were farm workers and resources were scarce, especially when it came to medical care. It wasn\u2019t just that the doctor was a 30-minute drive away in Firebaugh; going there meant losing a day\u2019s work.\n\n\u201cFor me, it was growing up in a place where access was always an issue,\u201d Mendoza said. \u201cMy dad had the only vehicle so that meant if we ever had to go to the doctor, he couldn\u2019t go to work that day.\u201d\n\nAnd if he didn\u2019t go to work, he wouldn\u2019t get paid. \u201cYou grow up and you really don\u2019t go to the doctor,\u201d said Mendoza, who is now the Central Valley program manager for the California School-Based Health Alliance.\n\nMerced County\u2019s First On-Site School Clinic\n\nIt\u2019s a situation Ralph Calderon sees every day. He\u2019s the principal of Livingston High School in this Central Valley town of 14,000 in Merced County. He said more than 90% of his students come from low-income families, typically from homes where both parents work, yet the median family income is below $40,000. Employment is usually in the fields, the packing houses or at the Foster Farms chicken processing plant.\n\n\u201cYou either go to work and get paid, or you don\u2019t earn that money,\u201d he said. \u201cYes, our parents absolutely love their kids and want to take care of them. But if it\u2019s a choice of food and clothing and a roof over their heads, the health problem is always going to come in fourth.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s one reason that Livingston High School will soon be the first site in Merced County to have a school-based health center with its own primary care physician and behavioral health clinician.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of mental health issues, stressors from poverty,\u201d said Calderon. \u201cThere are an inordinate amount of students with anxiety disorders that sometimes turn into full-blown panic attacks. These are the things we want to try to get addressed.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Livingston High School makes three times the number of ambulance calls as the other high schools in the Merced Union High School District, and it\u2019s the smallest school, with about 1,100 students.\n\nStakeholders Say Students\u2019 Mental Health is a Concern\n\nThe idea for the center evolved last year when the district was working on its Local Control Accountability Plan. Part of the process is to engage a stakeholder group of parents, students, teachers, administrators and staff to determine the needs of the district.\n\n\u201cThe largest area of concern was mental health and the overall wellness of students in our district,\u201d said Tammie Calzadillas, assistant superintendent of educational services.\n\nA local clinic that had an active relationship with the high school proposed a partnership. Livingston Community Health, a federally qualified health center, suggested a school-based community health clinic.\n\nCalzadillas said she became convinced this was the direction the district should take after looking at several studies. \u201cOverall attendance rates improve, the health of the family improves,\u201d she said.\n\nAccording to the California School-Based Health Alliance in Oakland, there are 231 school-based health centers in California. The schools usually provide in-kind contributions. The centers get reimbursed through private health plans, the Child Health and Disability Prevention Program, Family PACT and Medi-Cal, California\u2019s Medicaid program.\n\nLivingston High School will provide the facility, phone lines and parking spaces. Livingston Community Health will provide the services. \u201cThis is really about the overall health and wellness of students and taking the services to where the students and parents are,\u201d said Leslie McGowan, chief executive officer of Livingston Community Health.\n\nThe on-site center is expected to be open part-time by late summer and running full-time within a few months if approval is granted by the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development.\n\n\u201cWhat this will do is provide another point of access to care,\u201d McGowan said. \u201cThe needs of our community are definitely ones we feel equipped to address. We\u2019re a 45-year-old organization here.\u201d\n\nACA Leads to More Rural School-Based Clinics\n\nThe majority of school-based health centers are in urban areas; Los Angeles has 73, San Francisco has 17, and Fresno has 11. But more clinics are opening up in rural areas, said Mendoza, in part because of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cThey have grown significantly in the Valley and that is definitely because of the ACA\u2019s Health Resources and Services Administration grants,\u201d Mendoza said. Just this year, several school-based clinics opened in rural valley towns including Atwater, Raisin City and Earlimart.\n\nMendoza helps schools like these by providing start-up tech assistance. She also works with planning committees to navigate the process, and she started a coalition so administrators and staff can network and share knowledge, training and resources. She said a lot of these clinics start because schools are an axis of information for parents and are often troubleshooting health problems anyway. \u201cThis is a great way for schools to support academic success,\u201d Mendoza said. \u201cYou help troubleshoot on campus and all of a sudden students can get back to work.\u201d\n\nBut there are protocols. For instance, students at Livingston High School won\u2019t be able to go to the center whenever they want. Students will still go through the school nurse if they aren\u2019t feeling well and parents will be involved with appointments. \u201cWe want to make sure that when there\u2019s a physics exam, we don\u2019t have 27 students with stomachaches on the same day!\u201d said Calzadillas.\n\nOnce the Livingston High site is up and running, the district plans to put a school-based health center on the East Campus Educational Center in Merced. Eventually all six high schools in the district could have clinics.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a true believer in the education of the whole child,\u201d said Calzadillas. \u201cWhat people tend to say is, \u2018You\u2019re a public educator. Your job is to educate.\u2019 What I say to that is, \u2018If not us, then who? Who is going to take care of these kids?'\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s certainly an attitude Mendoza would have appreciated growing up on the west side of the valley where access to medical care was difficult and a school-based health center would have been ideal for her family. \u201cI would have loved to have had the opportunity to go to a doctor,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "<p>Partially in response to changes in the Affordable Care Act, Livingston High School will be the first school in Merced County to open an on-site community clinic. </p>", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "California Healthline", "description": "Partially in response to changes in the Affordable Care Act, Livingston High School will be the first school in Merced County to open an on-site community clinic.", "title": "Rural School-Based Health Centers Increasing in Central Valley", "url": "http://californiahealthline.org/news/rural-schoolbased-health-centers-increasing-in-central-valley/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/kaiser-californiahealthline/static/images/placeholder.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@CalHealthline", "card": "summary", "creator": "@CalHealthline"}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://californiahealthline.org/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico", "application-name": "California Healthline", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WordPresscom", "published_time": "2015-04-13T03:00:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-13T03:00:00+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbb15\"", "article_summary": "According to the California School-Based Health Alliance in Oakland, there are 231 school-based health centers in California.\nHe\u2019s the principal of Livingston High School in this Central Valley town of 14,000 in Merced County.\nLivingston Community Health, a federally qualified health center, suggested a school-based community health clinic.\nWe\u2019re a 45-year-old organization here.\u201dACA Leads to More Rural School-Based ClinicsThe majority of school-based health centers are in urban areas; Los Angeles has 73, San Francisco has 17, and Fresno has 11.\n\u201cYou grow up and you really don\u2019t go to the doctor,\u201d said Mendoza, who is now the Central Valley program manager for the California School-Based Health Alliance."}
