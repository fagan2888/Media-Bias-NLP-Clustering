The transmission utilizes four separate telescopes connected to a laser transmitter that feeds coded pulses of infrared light through it. Those signals travel toward a satellite orbiting the moon. Researchers have managed to make a connection and transfer data at a speed approximating slower Wi-Fi speeds on Earth.\n\nIt\u2019s no easy feat, and it doesn\u2019t work every time.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Researchers at NASA and MIT have figured out how to beam wireless connectivity from a ground base in New Mexico", "author": "Timothy McGrath", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Researchers at NASA and MIT have figured out how to beam wireless connectivity from a ground base in New Mexico", "title": "Wi-Fi on the moon is now as fast as the Wi-Fi in your living room", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/01/wi_fi_on_the_moon_is_now_as_fast_as_the_wi_fi_in_your_living_room_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/shutterstock_128924048.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Researchers at NASA and MIT have figured out how to beam wireless connectivity from a ground base in New Mexico", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/shutterstock_128924048.jpg", "title": "Wi-Fi on the moon is now as fast as the Wi-Fi in your living room", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Wi-Fi on the moon is now as fast as the Wi-Fi in your living room", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, GlobalPost, Internet, Moon, NASA, Wi-Fi", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd043c\"", "article_summary": "Topics: GlobalPost, Internet, Moon, NASA, Wi-Fi, Innovation News, Working Ahead News, Technology News, Life NewsThis article originally appeared on GlobalPostLife on the moon just got a whole lot more awesome.\nBut that\u2019s all okay now, because there\u2019s Wi-Fi.\nSure, you\u2019ve got to wear a spacesuit and there\u2019s not much to do in the way of recreation and nightlife.\nResearchers have managed to make a connection and transfer data at a speed approximating slower Wi-Fi speeds on Earth.\nResearchers at NASA and MIT have figured out how to beam wireless connectivity from a ground base in New Mexico to the moon using telescopes and lasers."}
