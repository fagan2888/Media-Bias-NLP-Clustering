They argue the agency must be reformed before Congress passes additional laws that would give the government more data.\n\nThe cybersecurity bills are intended to create a law that enables companies to share more cyber threat data with the government. Government officials and most industry groups argue greater cyber information-sharing is necessary to protect the country from hackers that have repeatedly breached companies and government agencies.\n\nAdvocates for the cybersecurity bill have already seen what can happen when the two issues mix.\n\nDuring December\u2019s lame-duck session, the Senate tried to concurrently move a cyber info-sharing bill and the USA Freedom Act, which would have reigned in the NSA\u2019s most controversial surveillance program.\n\nThe two issues got tied up. Privacy advocates, some congressional Democrats and the White House insisted Congress pass the USA Freedom Act before voting on any cyber info-sharing measure.\n\nWhen the USA Freedom bill died on the Senate floor after hours of heated speeches and a late-night vote, it all but destroyed the chances of the cyber bill going through.\n\nThis time, lawmakers are trying to take a different approach.\n\n\u201cThey wanted to get something done as quickly as they could to avoid the convolution with the NSA reform,\u201d said Alex Manning, who served as staff director of the House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Cybersecurity last Congress.\n\n\u201cFrom a strategic perspective, it is absolutely better to have [cyber legislation] move prior to that discussion,\u201d said Norma Krayem, a lobbyist with Squire Patton Boggs who co-chairs the firm\u2019s cybersecurity industry group.\n\nThe NSA programs must be reauthorized by June 1, giving cybersecurity legislation a narrow window to move.\n\nRepublicans, Democrats and even the White House seem mostly on board with a slate of cyber info-sharing bills, increasing the likelihood of success.\n\n\u201cThe prospects for successful passage of cyber legislation have gone up dramatically,\u201d House Intelligence Committee ranking member Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) told reporters last month.\n\nThe House Intelligence Committee started from scratch on a bill that forbids cyber threat data from going directly to the NSA. Although it still didn\u2019t win over privacy groups, several crucial Democrats, including Schiff, came around.\n\nThe panel also worked closely with their Homeland Security Committee colleagues on a novel approach to develop two complementary cyber info-sharing bills.\n\nOn the Senate side, the Intelligence Committee incorporated large portions of a White House's proposal into its revised bill.\n\nThe combined efforts have earned kinder words from the White House than last year.\n\nIn 2014, President Obama issued a veto threat against the House Intelligence Committee's bill. Then-Senate Intelligence Committee Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) also called out the administration for stalling her efforts.\n\nBut on Wednesday, White House Cybersecurity Coordinator Michael Daniel said the administration is \u201cvery encouraged\u201d by the Senate Intelligence Committee\u2019s work.\n\n\u201cWhile we still have some issues to work through, I think that we\u2019re confident that we have a path forward,\u201d he said.\n\nDaniel added, there was \u201ca way to work forward\u201d on both House bills as well.\n\nThe NSA talks could distract from the newfound comity, though, leaving lawmakers trying to fit cyber legislation into a cluttered legislative calendar throughout the summer and fall.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t do [cyber] by the end of April, then we\u2019ll have to do it by the end of July,\u201d after surveillance reform, said Manning, now the senior government relations director with Arent Fox.\n\nAt that point, Congress\u2019s rush to work on the annual spending bills could make time on the floor scarce.\n\nPrivacy advocates have not budged in their opposition. They want to see NSA reform happen before the cybersecurity legislation moves forward.\n\n\u201cWe continue to say that NSA surveillance reform needs to be the priority,\u201d said Gabe Rottman, legislative counsel with the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\n\u201cIt would be tragic if the first substantive congressional response to the [Edward] Snowden revelations about NSA abuses was to channel more Americans\u2019 communications information right to the NSA. Tragic\u201d said Greg Nojeim, senior counsel at the Center for Democracy & Technology.\n\nHouse leaders are teeing up their cyber bills to hit the floor the week of April 20. Senate leaders are hoping their bill will reach the floor on a similar timeframe.\n\nThat leaves only a few weeks of wiggle room before surveillance discussions start ramping up.\n\n\u201cThe further [cyber] gets pushed off, the lower the chances are,\u201d Manning said.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Advocates fear NSA debate will make cybersecurity work tougher.", "description": "Advocates fear NSA debate will make cybersecurity work tougher.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Cory Bennett", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Advocates fear NSA debate will make cybersecurity work tougher.", "title": "Lawmakers in cybersecurity rush", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/237875-lawmakers-in-cybersecurity-rush", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/nsa_protesters-1.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-04-06T13:04:15-04:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2015-04-06T13:04-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/237875-lawmakers-in-cybersecurity-rush", "dcterms.date": "2015-04-05T06:06-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Ian Swanson", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "cybersecurity, National Security Agency, nsa,Devin Nunes,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-05T06:06:01-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-06T13:04:15-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/237875-lawmakers-in-cybersecurity-rush", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Advocates fear NSA debate will make cybersecurity work tougher.", "card": "summary", "title": "Lawmakers in cybersecurity rush"}, "dcterms.title": "Lawmakers in cybersecurity rush"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbaf0\"", "article_summary": "Advocates for the cybersecurity bill have already seen what can happen when the two issues mix.\nLawmakers are rushing to pass a major cybersecurity bill this month before a divisive debate over reauthorizing the National Security Agency\u2019s surveillance programs bogs them down.\nBut on Wednesday, White House Cybersecurity Coordinator Michael Daniel said the administration is \u201cvery encouraged\u201d by the Senate Intelligence Committee\u2019s work.\nADVERTISEMENT\u201cApples and oranges,\u201d House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) told reporters.\nBut privacy advocates are worried the cybersecurity bill would shuttle more data into the government\u2019s hands \u2014 and have drawn a link to the debate over the NSA."}
