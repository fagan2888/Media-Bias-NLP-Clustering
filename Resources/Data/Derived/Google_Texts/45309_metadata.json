These statistics, of course, suggest a number of faults in the U.S. correctional system. A recent study may have identified one such fault in regards to the conviction of minors. Of the 57 youth suspects involved in the study, absolutely none evoked their Miranda rights during interrogation. With rates this high researchers believe the problem is more psychological than social.\n\nHayley Cleary, a developmental psychologist from Virginia Commonwealth University, analyzed 57 videotaped interrogations of young adults aged between 13 and 17 in police stations across America. The footage revealed that none of the young suspects accepted the right of having an attorney present during their interrogation. \u201cThis suggests that kids don\u2019t fully understand what it means to have the right or how important it is,\u201d Cleary told Medical Daily.\n\nIt\u2019s more than just not fully understanding the situation though. Cleary believes these young suspects may not even be able completely comprehend what's being asked of them. Many past studies have shown that areas of the brain responsible for executive functions such impulse control, judgment, and delayed gratification, are the last to be developed. These vulnerabilities may be carried into the interrogation room and critically affect the youth\u2019s ability to best decide on issues related to their constitutional rights.\n\nThe results remained the same even when factors such as gender, race, or whether or not the parent was present, was taken into context. According to the press release, only 6 of the 57 juvenile suspects were female. Of the remaining male suspects, 41 percent were identified as being white, 41 percent were black, and 18 percent were Latino or of an unknown ethnicity.\n\nAnother interesting finding from the study was that even with the presence of a parent during police interrogations, legal advice was still not sought. \u201cI would image that parents have conflicting roles, they want to defend their children, protect their children, at the same time they might feel compelled to teach children to own up to their actions. It\u2019s not fair to ask parents to compensate for their children,\u201d Cleary explained.\n\nTo Cleary, the underlying message delivered through this study is clear. \u201cChildren need an attorney,\u201d Cleary emphasized. In an ideal world an attorney would be given to every child suspect without the need for their request. This approach is admirable but Cleary suggested another which may prove more realistic. \u201cIt would help if police officers knew more about adolescent development. If police were aware of these Miranda comprehension problems it might help them to approach questioning youth, get the information they need and still protect children.\u201d\n\nSource: Clearly, H.
