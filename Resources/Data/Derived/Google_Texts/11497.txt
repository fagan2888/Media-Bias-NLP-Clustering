Unborn babies who are capable of feeling pain are one step closer to protection from gruesome death by dismemberment abortion in West Virginia. The House Judiciary Committee passed the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act (H.B. 4588) Friday afternoon on a voice vote.

Now that H.B. 4588 is out of Judiciary, the bill will go to the House floor for first, second, and third readings. After a favorable vote (and it should pass by an overwhelming margin), the bill will be sent to the Senate.

All week long pro-lifers around the state have been following the progress of H.B. 4588. Initially a Discharge Motion to bring the bill directly to the floor of the House for a vote (which took place February 11, the day of the annual Pro-Life Rally) failed on a tie vote. But six days later the bill was swiftly passed by voice vote through the House Health Committee. Then Friday afternoon, the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act passed on a voice vote in the Judiciary Committee.

However, time is not on our side. But with your help, the bill will get to the Senate by February 26, the last day for a bill to cross over.

H.B. 4588, will protect West Virginia’s unborn babies who can feel pain from a gruesome death by dismemberment or other horrific late abortion techniques. Substantial medical evidence demonstrates the baby’s ability to feel pain is present by 20 weeks.

We know that pro-life legislation saves lives. We know that every year legislators don’t pass pro-life legislation, precious little babies die.
