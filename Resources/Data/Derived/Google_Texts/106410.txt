*Actor, rapper and now health care spokesman.

Those are the many titles Mack Wilds is holding to his name today.

The young entertainer spoke out at the “BET Honors” about the Affordable Care Act.

And he spoke in a manner that will resonate with fellow young adults.

He said the act “can actually mean longer lives” for people around his age.

He told his peers and people in his age group to sign up by the deadline March 31.

He’s not the only celebrity to endorse the act. First lady Michelle Obama appeared on “Tom Joyner Morning Show” to discuss the act as well.

“… For this administration, it means healthcare through the Affordable Care Act. It means economic mobility. It means helping our young men of color. It means making sure more kids have access to college and it’s affordable,” she said. “So that’s what we’re going to be focusing on, not just this month, but for the rest of this administration, and making sure that people are signing up for healthcare is critical.”



BET’s president of music programming and specials Stephen Hill dished on when the ceremony and PSA will air.

“The PSA will air in the premiere of BET Honors on Monday, February 24 at 9pm ET. Every year during the show, BET Networks try to include a meaningful message that matters to our audience. In the past we have focused on issues such as voting and healthcare,” he said.

He continued with, “with the deadline coming up, we felt it was the best way to inform our viewers. The producers decided to go with Mack Wilds because he appeals to the youth.”
