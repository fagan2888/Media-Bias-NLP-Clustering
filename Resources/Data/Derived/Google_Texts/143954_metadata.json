Several streets were blocked off in the area as crews battled the blaze.\n\n\u201cIt sounds like there were a few people who jumped and were injured. They had others trapped on the second floor,\u201d Nunn said. \u201d Firefighters were able to extract them from that position and get them to safety.\u201d\n\nResidents described people rescuing infants using blankets and tossing them out windows.\n\n\u201cWe were sleeping,\u201d Derae Sanchez said, standing with Eric Lomba outside the building.\n\nLomba said they heard yelling. He smelled an odor \u201clike wires burning\u201d and \u201cI see a bunch of smoke,\u201d Lomba said.\n\nHe, Sanchez and Joey Pacheco, all residents of the lower level, left with money and belongings to the street. Pacheco said the fire started on the third level.\n\nPacheco said he saw a father trying to crawl back in the burning building to rescue his infant children. He said firefighters tackled the father, but later rescued the babies.\n\nThe cause of the fire hadn\u2019t been determined. Firefighters had largely snuffed the flames by 9:40 p.m.\n\nSome relatives rushed to the emergency room at Denver Health after hearing about the fire and residents jumping from the building.\n\nGene and Rosalie Ramirez came to the hospital to be there when their infant grandson arrived.\n\nTheir son had told them how the boy\u2019s mother jumped from the second floor.\n\n\u201cHe thinks she might have broken her back,\u201d Gene Ramirez said.\n\nThe fire happened about a half block north of Denver fire station No. 12, and Denver Public Schools opened a nearby school for residents who were displaced.\n\nDenver Health officials said late Sunday night six patients were in fair condition, three were in serious condition, and two were in critical condition.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Some residents injured in Denver apartment blaze Sunday night", "title": "Some residents injured in Denver apartment blaze Sunday night", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/03/27/some-residents-injured-in-denver-apartment-blaze-sunday-night/", "image": {"width": 1024, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160327_104039_Scene_Of_Fire.jpg.jpg", "height": 768}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160327_104039_Scene_Of_Fire.jpg.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-27T21:54:43+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-15T05:47:24+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Denver Health Medical Center ambulances carried \u201cmultiple injured parties\u201d for treatment, Denver Fire Department spokesman Lt.
