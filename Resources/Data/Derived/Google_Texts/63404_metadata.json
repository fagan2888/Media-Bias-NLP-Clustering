(Nikki Kahn/The Washington Post)\n\nMayor Vincent C. Gray formally launched his re-election campaign Saturday afternoon at THEARC, a community center in Southeast Washington. He gave the following remarks, presented as prepared for delivery.\n\n***\n\nThank you. Good afternoon.\n\nHow about a big hand for Mike McCoy and Voices United. That\u2019s homegrown talent.\n\nLet\u2019s hear it for the Indigo Project Trio from the Levine School of Music.\n\nThe Levine School does great work in this part of the city. I want to thank them for offering scholarships and helping students grow as artists.\n\nWe showcased some fantastic local talent here today. We\u2019re also in the company of people with deep roots in our community.\n\nI want to thank Rev. Dr. Ronald Braxton, Pastor of Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church for his moving invocation.\n\nAnd how about a big hand for the students who led us in the Pledge of Allegiance.\n\nMy dear friend Carrie Thornhill reminded us of our shared responsibility to nourish, inspire and create opportunity for tomorrow\u2019s generation. Carries\u2019s dedication to children and building strong communities is inspirational and longstanding. Thank you, Carrie.\n\nLeadership begins with commitment. And we lead by example, not through words. Jerry Moore is a remarkable and distinguished resident of our great city. Any endeavor is stronger with his steady hand on the rudder. I want to thank Jerry for chairing our campaign. Thank you, Jerry.\n\nOur campaign is led by co-chairs, too.\n\nJudith Terra\u2019s dedication to the arts and philanthropy spans the ideological spectrum. Her generosity is limitless. Thank you, Judith.\n\nSonia Gutierrez is also a co-chair. She has spent the past 40 years changing countless lives. Sonia\u2019s leadership as the founding director of the Carlos Rosario School has empowered immigrants and helps pave the way for their success. Thank you, Sonia\n\nJohn Tinpe is co-chairing our campaign, too. John is a restaurateur and a hard-working civic leader. His \u201ccan do\u201d approach to tackling challenges is something I admire. Thank you, John.\n\nWe\u2019re building a strong campaign with supporters from every neighborhood and from every ward.\n\nEach Democratic candidate needed 2,000 signatures to get on the ballot.\n\nPlease give a huge round of applause to our supporters who collected signatures in the cold, in the rain, in snow and sleet, and over the holidays. We needed 2,000. They collected more than 8,200.\n\nCampaigns and elections are about the future.\n\nA good candidate must answer two basic questions: what do you plan to do AND how do you plan to do it.\n\nWe have big plans and a record that proves we can accomplish them.\n\nBut, before we talk about the future, I want to say something about the past.\n\nEveryone knows that our 2010 campaign had shortcomings.\n\nI have spoken with people in living rooms, backyards, barber shops and on sidewalks. I have apologized to family, friends and colleagues.\n\nI know that the 2010 campaign caused many people great pain. I know that our city suffered embarrassment.\n\nToday, I apologize to you for the pain that my campaign caused. I ask for your forgiveness.\n\nAlthough I cannot apologize for the misdeeds of others, the 2010 campaign was my campaign, and I am deeply sorry for the pain and embarrassment it has caused.\n\nI have worked hard to earn your respect and honor you these past three years. I have put my shoulder to the stone and used the strength that you give me. Every day I come to work committed to doing the job you elected me to do.\n\nIt is time to turn the page. I know that some journalists and our opponents want you to focus on the past. I know that some reporters prefer a circus to a thoughtful discussion of issues. I know that they care about ratings and selling newspapers.\n\nI care about you.\n\nI have dedicated my entire career to our community. From the day I graduated college to this morning when I greeted the new day, I have worked on behalf of you and the neediest among us.\n\nWe cannot be mired in the past.\n\nWe have a lot of work to do.\n\nOur city is vibrant and growing, but too many residents are still living without jobs, the security of a stable home, or the certainty of a warm meal.\n\nWhile the city experienced economic development throughout the past decade, too much of it was scattershot. Too little reached the people in greatest need. Too many went without work.\n\nMy administration set out in a new direction. We brought every group to the table and have worked together to foster development that benefits every District resident.\n\nAnd our efforts are bearing fruit. You can see it all across the city. Unemployment in our poorest neighborhoods has fallen significantly.\n\nIf we stay the course, if we double-down on our commitment, if we refuse to accept anything less than success, we will see everyone in our city thrive and prosper.\n\nWe can do this.\n\nWe will do this.\n\nJust look what we have already accomplished.\n\nIn 2013, our students achieved the biggest gains of any state and any big city in America.\n\nDistrict students, led by District teachers, posted the single largest improvement in the United States.\n\nWe\u2019ve rebuilt and renovated schools all across the city, including both Anacostia and Ballou High Schools right here in Ward 8. And we are building state-of-the art facilities all across our city where our children are learning the skills they\u2019ll need to compete and thrive in a 21st century economy.\n\nEvery year, we are providing parents with more educational options for their children. New charter schools are opening and our traditional public schools are offering programs that are the envy of school districts across the country.\n\nOur universal pre-K program is the most robust and well attended in the nation. It has been heralded by President Obama\u2019s Secretary of Education as a national model.\n\n70 percent of our three year-olds and 92 percent of our four year-olds are in school.\n\nOur work is not done, but our schools are heading in the right direction.\n\nAnd while we\u2019re talking about work, how about this: in the past three years we have created more than 25,000 new private sector jobs in the District of Columbia. Many of those jobs went to District residents, and we will continue to insist that employers hire more and more of our residents.\n\nWe developed the One City One Hire Program, and it\u2019s put nearly 9,000 of our friends and neighbors back to work.\n\nUnemployment in our hardest hit Wards continues to drop. Citywide, it has fallen from 11.2 percent to 8.6 percent today. And while still high here in Ward 8, unemployment has dropped from a staggering 25.4 percent to 18.2 percent.\n\nWe are teaming up with unions and the private sector on job training programs that are helping our young men and women enter the workforce.\n\nThe job market is very competitive and we are helping District residents to compete.\n\nBut even with all this success we still face challenges. Our city is getting more expensive. Everyone feels it. And for our residents with the fewest resources, sometimes what they feel is fear. Fear that they are not able to makes ends meet. Fear that they cannot afford to live here anymore. Fear that they will have no place in our great city.\n\nThousands of long-term residents, many of whom are senior citizens, held this city together during its toughest times. They stayed, they sacrificed and they forthrightly faced challenges when others fled.\n\nToday, people move into the District of Columbia because it offers opportunity and a wonderfully diverse culture.\n\nWe must not forget the residents who held our city together. They should not be afraid that soon a home in our city will be entirely out of their reach.\n\nThat\u2019s why I committed the District to an unprecedented investment of $187 million in affordable housing. We are on track to create or preserve 10,000 units of affordable housing by 2020.\n\nThat\u2019s 10,000 homes where people can raise a family and pursue their dreams more comfortable knowing that they have a place in the District\u2019s future.\n\nAnd we will honor our senior citizens, the backbone of this city, by guaranteeing that their golden years are not filled with worry, but instead filled with pride.\n\nOur city is strong. The people who live here make it that way.\n\nWe\u2019ve stood tall during tough times. We\u2019ve faced great challenges, many of which are not of our own doing.\n\nDid we yield to Congress when their dysfunctional shutdown threatened to choke our finances? No. We stayed open for business!\n\nWe let the nation know that every person in our great city is essential!\n\nI stood up to Congress and was able to say \u201cNO\u201d to leaders on Capitol Hill because the 646,000 people who live here have my back.\n\nAnd please know that I have your back, too!\n\nWe have a lot of work to do. But we are the people to do it.\n\nI look around this room and I see folks from every part of our city. I see enormous talent and tireless dedication. I see white, I see black, I see brown, and every color in-between. I see straight, I see gay, and I see transgender. I see rich and I see poor. But above all, I see what makes us the greatest city in the greatest country on earth, I see a community.\n\nThe District of Columbia has always been my home. It is an honor to advocate for the people and communities of our great city. It is my life\u2019s work.\n\nI ask that you continue to stand with me. I will continue to work tirelessly for you, and together we will accomplish what we set out to achieve.\n\nThis is an election we must win.\n\nWe\u2019ve come too far to turn back now.\n\nWe are bringing together young and old, black, brown and white, Latino, Asian, immigrants from throughout the world, gay, straight, able and disabled.\n\nWe are creating a city that every District resident is proud of. A city that embraces, nurtures and empowers every one of us.\n\nOne City, indivisible with liberty and justice for all.\n\nThank you!", "article_metadata": {"description": "Gray formally launched his re-election campaign Saturday afternoon in Southeast Washington.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/madebonis", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Gray formally launched his re-election campaign Saturday afternoon in Southeast Washington.", "title": "Read: Vincent Gray\u2019s campaign kickoff speech", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/mike-debonis/wp/2014/01/11/read-vincent-grays-campaign-kickoff-speech/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2013/09/12/Interactivity/Images/crop-gray.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@mikedebonis"}, "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Vincent Gray, Vincent Gray DC, Vincent Gray re-election, Vincent Gray kickoff, Vincent Gray speech, Vincent Gray rally, Vincent Gray address,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/madebonis"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Vincent Gray, Vincent Gray DC, Vincent Gray re-election, Vincent Gray kickoff, Vincent Gray speech, Vincent Gray rally, Vincent Gray address,"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce921\"", "article_summary": "It is an honor to advocate for the people and communities of our great city.\nMany of those jobs went to District residents, and we will continue to insist that employers hire more and more of our residents.\nJerry Moore is a remarkable and distinguished resident of our great city.\nThe job market is very competitive and we are helping District residents to compete.\nFear that they will have no place in our great city."}
