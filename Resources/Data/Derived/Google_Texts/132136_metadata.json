Patrick Murphy, D-Fla., the second youngest member of Congress.\n\n\u201cWith debt in our country \u2026 are there serious attempts being made to reduce it?\u201d Murphy added. \u201cNo, but there\u2019s a lot of talk about it. And that debt burden is going to be on this generation.\u201d\n\nSpillane and LinkedIn co-founder Allen Blue also spotlighted a need for politicians to meet millennials where they live: online. Spillane specifically acknowledged the importance of \u201cauthenticity\u201d when asked by Wall Street Journal\u2019s Nick Timiraos how carrying the \u201cInternet around in their pants\u201d via smartphones has changed the way young Americans interact with their world.\n\n\u201cMillennials have a bulls**t meter that is so on point,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re running campaigns and you\u2019re not communicating authentically and you\u2019re not communicating about issues that young people care about, they see through it so quickly. I think that that part of campaigning hasn\u2019t necessarily caught up yet.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A smaller national debt to pay off, for starters.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A smaller national debt to pay off, for starters.", "title": "What Do Millennials Want From Washington?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/millennials.jpg", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1Kiwmi2"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A smaller national debt to pay off, for starters.", "title": "What Do Millennials Want From Washington?", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/millennials.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "debt", "published_time": "2015-05-19T17:30:45+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Millennials, 2016 election, debt, voter turnout, Rock the Vote, student loans, debt"}, "article_summary": "\u201cMillennials have a bulls**t meter that is so on point,\u201d she said.\nAnd that debt burden is going to be on this generation.\u201dSpillane and LinkedIn co-founder Allen Blue also spotlighted a need for politicians to meet millennials where they live: online.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re running campaigns and you\u2019re not communicating authentically and you\u2019re not communicating about issues that young people care about, they see through it so quickly.\nPanelists discussed a host of issues plaguing millennials, who now make up the largest generation in our country\u2019s history and the largest segment of the U.S. workforce\u2014and how politicians ought to better target this segment of the population.\n\u201cFrom a policy perspective, I do not think there is very much legislation, if anything major, I can speak to being tailored or addressed for millennials,\u201d said Rep.
