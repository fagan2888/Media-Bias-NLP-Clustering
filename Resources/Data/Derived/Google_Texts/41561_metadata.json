As recently as 2010, over two-thirds of these United States had banned homosexual marriage, with Americans overwhelmingly rejecting same-sex marriage at the ballot box. Incredibly, federal judges have arrogantly reversed the decisions of voters in most of those states, leaving just five states nationwide with bans in place, undisturbed by court ruling. (There are 13 states in which homosexual marriage is still banned. However, for eight of those states, courts have overturned the bans but have stayed their reversal until appeals have run.)\n\nAnd now, in Obergefell v. Hodges, the U.S. Supreme Court is poised to void the few remaining pro-traditional marriage laws, nationwide.\n\nHow did a country, founded on religious freedom by largely God-fearing, Bible-reading patriots reach this point? First, despite the federal judiciary\u2019s near full-body embrace of homosexual marriage, such sexual couplings are not equally accepted by ordinary Americans. To be sure, attitudes are changing \u2013 in part due to the increasing inclination to look to \u201cthe civil law\u201d rather than God for morality \u2013 but the American people by and large reject the idea that any marriage other than that of one man to one woman is a good idea.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nThe elites have a completely different view. All one need do is look at Hollywood\u2019s hyper-evangelical effort to indoctrinate television viewers and moviegoers through the ubiquitous insertion of out-of-place subplots portraying loving, happy homosexuals. One can\u2019t even enjoy watching the apocalyptic showdown between remnants of the human race and hordes of zombies in AMC\u2019s blockbuster The Walking Dead without being interrupted by homosexual passion.\n\nThe news media plays the same game, with its unrelenting agenda to force cultural acceptance of homosexual marriage. From the predictable prophets of the left, to those who we had once thought were on the right like Fox\u2019s Shepard Smith, almost all champion homosexuality and suggest no qualitative or moral difference between heterosexual and same-sex marriage. \u201cFamily friendly\u201d drag queen contests on military posts sponsored by federal dollars are celebrated. Families with children raised by transgender, bisexual, or homosexual parents are presented as normal. Counseling to address gender identity issues or same-sex attraction is trashed as unscientific and hateful \u2013 even, in some places like California, outlawed altogether.\n\nPolitical elites \u2013 both Democrats and Republicans \u2013 are no different. Republicans like Majority Leader McConnell and Speaker Boehner will occasionally throw a rhetorical bone to their constituents on the issue, but they\u2019ll never direct real political capital toward efforts to promote traditional marriage or to preserve states\u2019 rights on the issue. Looking at the number of homosexuals working as congressional staff, the acceptance of federal efforts to celebrate homosexuality, and other telling factors, all reflect where the political elites are personally on this issue. And their wholesale silence over the impending Supreme Court decision on homosexual marriage is especially telling.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nIn the face of a population that has historically embraced traditional marriage and rejected same-sex relationships, what has empowered the homosexual-pushing political and media elites to such an extent that allies of true marriage are running for cover?\n\nWithout a doubt, there are a number of enablers; but the federal judiciary is a central driver. As other articles (Part I, Part II, Part III, Part IV, Part V, and Part VI) in the \u201cBuilding the Resistance to Same-Sex Marriage\u201d series have convincingly explained, the federal judiciary has largely abandoned any pretext of following the drafters\u2019 intent with respect to the Constitution and its Amendments as applied to same-sex marriage. Apparently, these judges believe the oath they have taken requires no deference to the Constitution\u2019s plain meaning.\n\nGranted, some judges believe that they are compelled to follow the dictates of superior (higher) courts, even if those decisions violate the written Constitution. This is a poor excuse, as the judge\u2019s oath is to the Constitution, not to some twisted interpretation of it. While indefensible, this approach stands in contrast to the illegitimacy of other members of the federal judiciary who spin dozens of pages of judicial decisions, ginning up creative and largely illogical reasons for why constitutional language \u2013 drafted when homosexuality was criminalized throughout the United States \u2013 somehow now compels protection of same-sex marriage and sodomy.\n\nWhat is even more troublesome are those Justices who have such zeal for the homosexual agenda that they have made supportive public statements and have even voluntarily officiated at homosexual marriages \u2013 despite knowing that the question of homosexual marriage would be presented before them for future decision.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nThere is a Code of Conduct under which federal judges \u2013 including U.S. Supreme Court Justices \u2013 are bound to comply. (Justice Kennedy stated on March 14, 2013 that he and the other justices of the Supreme Court consider the Code of Conduct to be \u201cabsolutely binding.\u201d) Canon 3A(6) of that Code of Conduct requires that a judge \u201cnot make public comment on the merits of a matter pending or impending in any court.\u201d Canon 2A of the same Code provides that a judge \u201cshould act at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary.\u201d Finally, a federal statute, 28 U.S.C. sec. 455(a), further mandates that a federal judge \u201cdisqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.\u201d\n\nU.S. Supreme Court Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Elena Kagan have violated these standards. Both justices have presided over same-sex weddings despite their knowledge of pending federal homosexual marriage cases. Justice Ginsburg has been especially vocal, stating in August 2013 regarding an impending homosexual marriage she was presiding over in Washington, D.C., that \u201cI think it will be one more statement that people who love each other and want to live together should be able to enjoy the blessings and the strife in a marriage relationship.\u201d\n\nAgain, this past February, Justice Ginsburg said that it \u201cwould not take a large adjustment\u201d for Americans to accept homosexual marriage:\n\n\u201cThe change in people\u2019s attitudes on that issue has been enormous. In recent years, people have said, \u2018This is the way I am.\u2019 And others looked around, and we discovered it\u2019s our next-door neighbor \u2013 we\u2019re very fond of them. Or it\u2019s our child\u2019s best friend, or even our child. I think that as more and more people came out and said that \u2018this is who I am,\u2019 the rest of us recognized that they are one of us.\u201d\n\nIn response to these pro-homosexual marriage statements and actions, a number of conservative groups contended that Justice Ginsburg\u2019s bias on the issue had been publicly and conclusively established, and demanded that she not participate in Obergefell v. Hodges. The Foundation for Moral Law, which filed an amicus brief in support of traditional marriage, also filed a thoughtful Motion for Recusal in the U.S. Supreme Court in April; but the motion has yet to appear on the Court\u2019s Docket Sheet for the case. Instead, ex-ACLU attorney Justice Ginsburg doubled-down, marrying two men in New York City just last month. According to the New York Times, the Justice made a bit of a spectacle of her support for same-sex marriage during this recent ceremony:\n\n\u201c[T]he most glittering moment for the crowd came during the ceremony. With a sly look and special emphasis on the word \u201cConstitution,\u201d Justice Ginsburg said that she was pronouncing two men married by the powers vested in her by the Constitution of the United States. \u201cNo one was sure if she was emphasizing her own beliefs or giving a hint to the outcome of the case the Supreme Court is considering whether to decide if same-sex marriage is constitutional. \u201cBut the guests began applauding loudly, delighted either way. Justice Ginsburg, who has officiated at same-sex weddings in the past, also seemed delighted . . . Justice Ginsburg [later] reigned as belle of the same-sex ball.\u201d\n\nHow Justice Ginsburg \u2013 whom the left describes as \u201cbrilliant\u201d \u2013 could think that such actions and past statements would not raise obvious questions of partiality in a case involving the U.S. Constitution and homosexual marriage is especially troubling. And yet she has aggressively continued her participation in Obergefell v. Hodges as reflected by her active engagement in the case\u2019s oral argument just several weeks ago.\n\nSimilarly, Justice Kagan\u2019s voluntary officiation over a homosexual marriage (involving her former law clerk) \u2013 although arguably less public than her colleague\u2019s antics \u2013 also causes her \u201cimpartiality [to] reasonably be questioned.\u201d\n\nIn 1988, the U.S. Supreme Court in Liljeberg v. Health Servs. Acquisition Corp (486 U.S. 847, 869-870) quoted Justice Frankfurter, explaining that the \u201c\u2018guiding consideration is that the administration of justice should reasonably appear to be disinterested as well as be so in fact.'\u201d Here, appearance and fact are consonant: Justices Ginsburg and Kagan are vested in their same-sex marriage positions. This partiality also raises real concerns of whether the litigants in Obergefell v. Hodges can receive due process from those who have demonstrated bias.\n\nSo what can be done about Justices who ignore the ethical standards in violation of the judicial Code of Conduct and who violate a federal statute barring their participation in a \u201cproceeding in which [their] impartiality might reasonably be questioned\u201d? Obviously, there is no court above the U.S. Supreme Court from which discipline may be applied. Nor is there a mechanism by which other justices can vote a biased colleague off a case. Internal policing doesn\u2019t appear to be working in Obergefell v. Hodges, even though a number of justices have previously disqualified themselves from cases in which they have vested interests or have made public comments.\n\nThe only answer for justices who blatantly violate their Code of Conduct, federal law, and their oaths of office is impeachment and removal. Regrettably, a Republican-controlled Congress, more concerned about rescuing Obamacare than resisting yet another activist attack on the Constitution, offers little hope. Unless and until Members of Congress demonstrate real fidelity to the U.S. Constitution, no Ruling Class politicos in either party can be trusted\u2013and none should be supported\u2013by those who seek to restore liberty to our nation.\n\n__________________________\n\nJoe Miller graduated from West Point in the top 1 percent of the Class of 1989.
