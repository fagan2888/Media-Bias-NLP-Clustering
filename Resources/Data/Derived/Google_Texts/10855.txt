The Lake Afton All Wheels Car Show had hundreds coming out to see classic cars.

Many people who participated in the event say that upkeep on the classic cars can be very expensive.

"What I got in it and what it is worth is two totally different entities but it is a labor of love, these cars are all labors of love," said one car owner.
