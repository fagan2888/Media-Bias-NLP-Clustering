Bush created Department of Homeland Security in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. It\u2019ll run out of money and partially shut down by the end of the week unless the Republican-majority Congress passes a bill that doesn\u2019t tie Homeland Security to a full repeal of President Barack Obama\u2019s order on immigration reform. Raising the alarm (and cranking up the pressure on the GOP), DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson hit the airwaves Sunday to say funding is really, really important, especially since the Islamic State group called on its allies -- including American sympathizers -- to attack American shopping malls in the near future. Here\u2019s your Three-Minute Briefing, all the News You Can Use in 180 seconds or less:\n\n[READ: Is a Deal in the Works to Avoid a DHS Shutdown?]\n\nFeeling Queasy: The latest slice in the right\u2019s \u201cdeath by a thousand cuts\u201d attack on the Affordable Care Act, a legal challenge pending before the Supreme Court, could pierce its jugular, effectively crippling the law. That\u2019s been keeping the nation\u2019s governors up at night, worried that health-care costs they would have to bear solo -- without the Obamacare\u2019s federal subsidies they can get now -- could bleed their state budgets dry.\n\nPicking His Battles: Obama\u2019s request for a revamped Authorization for Use of Military Force, already a subject of hot partisan debate in Congress, could get even weirder: Republicans want to give him -- and his successor -- more power to fight the Islamic State group than the Democrats, who think more power for a president to declare war is a really bad idea (see: Bush, George W.). So Obama\u2019s got to choose whether to antagonize fellow Dems who are challenging Mr. Nobel Peace Prize over his anti-war cred, or to focus on Republicans, who want him to stamp out the Islamic State group once and for all.\n\nMeeting of Minds: In his first full week on the job, Defense Secretary Ashton Carter will need lots of brainpower to figure out how to solve the Rubik\u2019s cube situation in the Middle East, including the hot mess in Iraq and Syria, and he\u2019ll need every ounce of brainpower to get it right. Carter, who\u2019s vowed \u201clasting defeat\u201d against the Islamic State group, on Monday convenes a meeting of American commanders and regional diplomats to hear about what\u2019s happening on the ground and any ideas how to solve it. At least one idea isn\u2019t likely to sit well with the folks back home: slow-walking U.S. troops out of Afghanistan.\n\nSeriously -- Give War a Chance: Speaking of intractable armed conflicts and global instability, a bipartisan group of senators led by Sen. Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, and Sen. John McCain, an Arizona Republican, have asked Obama to do something about Russia\u2019s incursion into Ukraine -- and by \u201csomething,\u201d they mean, \u201c\u2018Ship military hardware to the Ukrainians, and get with the proxy war, already!\u2019\u201d Oh, and they\u2019re also calling for more sanctions, even though the ones in place now don\u2019t seem to have been all that effective.\n\nJust Not That Into Him: The dog-whistle politics of former 9/11 mayor Republican gadfly Rudy Giuliani dominated the Sunday chats, with much air time spent parsing the failed 2008 presidential candidate\u2019s racially tinged assessment that Obama doesn\u2019t love America. Fusion writer Jay Smooth, a New Yorker, writes that Hizzoner\u2019s got it wrong and America really doesn\u2019t love Rudy because of his long history of this sort of thing.\n\nDiamond Life: Reports of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie\u2019s taste for private travel, luxury stadium skyboxes and six-digit hotel suites did serious damage to his image as a regular guy from Jersey. Now comes reports that Jeb Bush\u2019s seemingly low-key wife, Columba, loves the finer things in life, too: trips to Paris for five-figure shopping sprees on jewelry and haute couture. Too early to say if that\u2019s going to be an issue -- Columba\u2019s not running for office and resolutely stays in the background -- but it could help remind voters that The Smart One in the Bush family made tons of money after leaving office, and his family roots are firmly planted in the one percent.\n\n[ALSO: GOP Donors Provide Cover for Bush on Immigration]\n\nOccupy Hollywood: In his Oscar acceptance speech, John Legend spoke out about the disproportionate incarceration of black men. Winner Patricia Arquette demanded equal rights and pay for women. In their speeches, Glenn Greenwald decried about government surveillance and Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu prayed for immigration reform. In Arquette\u2019s case, some heavyweight lefties on Twitter chimed in to say \u201cAmen!\u201d. Which begged the question: Was it the 87st annual Academy Awards, or a Netroots Nation panel discussion?\n\nYour Oscar Winners:\n\nBest Picture: \u201cBirdman\u201d\n\nBest Actor: Eddie Redmayne (\u201cThe Theory of Everything\u201d)\n\nBest Actress: Julianne Moore (\u201cStill Alice\u201d)\n\nBest Supporting Actor: J.K.
