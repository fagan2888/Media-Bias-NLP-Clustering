â€” Nearly two dozen students were hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries Wednesday morning after the school bus they were on was involved in a wreck.

Forty-eight students were on the bus at the time of the accident, which happened at about 8:15 a.m. at the intersection of Greenleaf Road and N.C. Highway 50, near McGee's Crossroads Elementary School.

According to investigators, a red Mitsubishi Eclipse leaving the school failed to yield and was hit by a truck pulling a trailer. Both vehicles ran into the school bus, which was stopped on N.C. 50 waiting to turn into the school.

Fifteen students were taken to three different hospitals - Smithfield, Clayton and WakeMed. All had minor injuries and were transported as a precaution.

The driver of the Eclipse, Michelle Gonzales, 25, of Angier, was taken to WakeMed with non-life threatening injuries.

The school bus driver, Robert Talton, 65, of Raleigh, was treated and released from WakeMed.

The dump truck driver, Joey Williams, 23, of Benson, was not hospitalized.

Authorities closed N.C. 50 just south of N.C. Highway 210 for about two hours following the wreck.

Charges are pending in the ongoing investigation, authorities said.
