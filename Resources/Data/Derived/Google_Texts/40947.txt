One less wife. Sister Wives star Kody Brown is slimming down from four wives to three after his first wife Meri filed for divorce earlier this month.

Though there was initial speculation that the decision was Kody's, Us Weekly can debut a new clip from an upcoming episode of the TLC show that reveals it was Meri's choice.

In Sister Wives' fifth season finale, which is airing on March 1, Kody and his fourth wife Robyn are shown arriving at Meri's home.

"I actually don't know why Meri is wanting Kody and I to come over and talk with her," Robyn tells the camera in the clip. "I'm wondering if it has something to do with her schooling."

"So when Meri called Robyn and I over and we head over there, it's not uncommon in our family to have somebody say, 'Hey, I just need to talk to you,'" Kody chimed in. "I didn't even know what to expect. I didn't know what was going on."

Unfortunately for the pair, they were in for a huge surprise when they finally sat down with Meri, who told the camera that she was "feeling just a little bit nervous."

The mother of daughter Mariah, 19, then nervously admitted that she no longer wished to be married to Kody, who is the father of 17 children with Meri, Robyn, and his two other wives, Janelle and Christine.

"I just had an appointment with a lawyer," Meri begins. "I was talking to him about getting a legal divorce."
