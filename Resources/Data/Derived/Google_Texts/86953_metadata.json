That was the highest percentage of any state in the country.\n\nGiven that stat, it\u2019s no wonder that a private duty agency based in that state is pushing hard on new initiatives to reduce hospital readmissions, believing that more home care providers are competing on this metric and that major referral streams are at stake.\n\n\u201cWe recognized early on that as a private pay home care company, although we are on the periphery of the Affordable Care Act [programs], we do play a big part in it,\u201d says Lenny Verkhoglaz, CEO of Executive Care, a Hackensack-based private duty provider that has franchises in New Jersey, Florida, and Texas.\n\nThe government does not directly control private pay revenues as it does Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements. But home care is affected by ACA programs that reduce Medicare payments to hospitals that readmit a high proportion of patients. These hospitals\u2014and the physician practices, skilled nursing facilities, and other organizations that may be partnered with them\u2014now have a strong incentive to work with home care agencies that can keep their patients from cycling back too frequently.\n\nExecutive Care has responded by developing staff training and protocols in the last nine months. The initiative is focused on specific conditions that are formally associated with Medicare readmission penalties or that place a patient at high risk of being rehospitalized. These include congestive heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, diabetes, and chronic pulmonary obstructive disorder (COPD).\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve developed programs for our nurses and caregivers to understand what the disease or condition is, how to recognize it, how to not necessarily treat it but monitor it,\u201d Verkhoglaz says. \u201cIf they see red flags go up, they alert the office, the social worker, whoever can take appropriate action.\u201d\n\nThe training is done on an in-service basis, face-to-face, in a classroom with overhead projections and written materials. The low-tech approach may change, if Executive Care finds a technology solution that fits its needs, Verkhoglaz says. But a private duty agency does not need a big capital outlay on technology in order to make inroads on this front, he emphasizes.\n\nHowever, skilled staff members are needed, as qualified nurses and trainable caregivers are the lynchpin of the effort, according to Verkhoglaz.\n\n\u201cThese are serious cases,\u201d he says of the diagnoses that are involved. \u201cObviously, you can\u2019t assign just any caregiver to these cases, they have to be the cream of the crop, who can understand and react.\u201d\n\nSo far, Executive Care has achieved the best results for conditions such as depression and diabetes. Diseases that are harder to control, such as congestive heart failure, are more challenging, Verkhoglaz says. Still, after starting this approach with one hospital, Executive Care now is rolling it out to others and is getting a good reception.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve created fliers touting our programs,\u201d Verkhoglaz says. \u201cWe give them out to case managers and discharge planners to make them aware that this exists that we\u2019re ready to take on their clients, what kind of training we provide to our caregivers. There seems to be very high interest \u2026 we\u2019re getting good feedback.\u201d\n\nExecutive Care is continuing to work hard, not only to keep improving its numbers but to remain competitive in the home care marketplace.\n\n\u201cOther companies are touting their programs,\u201d Verkhoglaz says. \u201cWe\u2019re not the only ones doing this.\u201d\n\nWritten by Tim Mullaney", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Home Health Care News", "description": "When the numbers came in last summer, they did not look good for New Jersey: 97% of the Garden State\u2019s hospitals would see their Medicare payments reduced because of how many patients had been read\u2026", "title": "How One Private Duty Agency is Reducing Hospital Readmissions", "url": "http://homehealthcarenews.com/2016/02/how-one-private-duty-agency-is-reducing-hospital-readmissions/", "image": {"width": 2048, "identifier": "http://homehealthcarenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/17251341714_19a9557c31_k.jpg", "height": 1153}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://homehealthcarenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/17251341714_19a9557c31_k.jpg?w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-16T19:32:39+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-16T19:34:00+00:00"}, "keywords": "executive care", "google-site-verification": "Rai6JqeaY4HdpW3X6OfZjfRSde5qzZ0G46ODDHL4GIU", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "But a private duty agency does not need a big capital outlay on technology in order to make inroads on this front, he emphasizes.\nStill, after starting this approach with one hospital, Executive Care now is rolling it out to others and is getting a good reception.\nGiven that stat, it\u2019s no wonder that a private duty agency based in that state is pushing hard on new initiatives to reduce hospital readmissions, believing that more home care providers are competing on this metric and that major referral streams are at stake.\n\u201cOther companies are touting their programs,\u201d Verkhoglaz says.\nHow One Private Duty Agency is Reducing Hospital ReadmissionsWhen the numbers came in last summer, they did not look good for New Jersey: 97% of the Garden State\u2019s hospitals would see their Medicare payments reduced because of how many patients had been readmitted."}
