The signs bear an emblem of a sheriff\u2019s badge with the words, \u201cYou are your choices\u201d on it.\n\n\u201cWe all go through difficult circumstances,\u201d said Rowland, 39. \u201cBut you can\u2019t let your circumstances define who you are. You need to accept what\u2019s happened, address it, and move forward.\u201d\n\nWhen Rowland was 2 years old, his father was being detained in the Maury County jail when a fire broke out in the jail\u2019s padded cell on June 26, 1977. The fire, which became the largest mass-death tragedy in Maury County history, killing 42 people, occurred during visiting hours at the jail. Rowland\u2019s mother, grandmother, aunt and two uncles were there to see his father.\n\nThey all died in the fire.\n\nRowland was raised by his mother\u2019s sister, whose husband was one of the fatalities.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s actually who I stayed with the day my family came up to visit my dad,\u201d Rowland said. \u201cShe had four kids of her own, and she never remarried, so she was a widow with five kids.\u201d\n\nRowland attributes his strong work ethic to his aunt, who milked cows for a living and raised all five children on a dairy farm. But all boys need a father figure in their lives, and Rowland was no exception.\n\n\u201cProbably the most influential male role model that I had was my next door neighbor, Elton Sisk,\u201d Rowland said. \u201cHe and his wife reached out to me at an early age and actually invited me to go to Vacation Bible School. That\u2019s kind of where it started.\u201d\n\nElton Sisk\u2019s wife Sharon has a particular memory that summarizes the relationship the couple had with Rowland as a child.\n\n\u201cAt our church, all the dads receive a gift on Father\u2019s Day,\u201d Sharon Sisk said. \u201cOne year Bucky was at church with us on Father\u2019s Day and someone said, \u2018Bucky, you didn\u2019t get a gift to give your dad!\u2019 Then he said, \u2018I don\u2019t have a dad. But if I did, I would want him to be just like Mr. Sisk.\u2019\u201d\n\nElton Sisk said that when Rowland was a kid he would frequently ride his four-wheeler to the couple\u2019s house, and Elton Sisk, who owned a lawn-mowing business, would fill the tank with gas for him before he rode back home.\n\n\u201cHe would always say, \u2018I\u2019ll pay you back!,\u201d Elton Sisk said. \u201cAnd he never did. But that\u2019s OK.\u201d\n\nRowland said Sisk was one of a handful of men who influenced him while he was growing up.\n\n\u201cThere were four or five men in my life that really invested in me, from church to hunting and fishing to mechanic work and running equipment,\u201d he said.\n\nRowland said his positive male role models inspired him to start a children\u2019s ministry. The ministry, Heavenly Views Outdoor Ministries, takes children on trips to do activities such as canoeing, fishing, and horseback riding, while encouraging prayer and Scripture reading. Rowland started the ministry about five years ago, and he plans to continue it during his term as sheriff.\n\nThe ministry is open to all children, but Rowland especially encourages those from single-parent homes or who have physical challenges to participate.\n\n\u201cYouth is so important,\u201d he said. \u201cI know what just a little bit of influence from someone, just showing that you care about them and love them, how far that goes.\u201d\n\nRowland said a goal in every aspect of his life is to leave people better than he finds them, a concept that he plans to take with him when he assumes office Sept. 1.\n\nKyle Cheek, who was partners with Rowland for six years while working in the K-9 units at the Maury County Sheriff\u2019s Department, said Rowland\u2019s decision to run for sheriff took him somewhat by surprise.\n\n\u201cEver since we were partners, he told me that one day he wanted to run for sheriff. But it came faster than we thought it would,\u201d Cheek said. \u201cWhen the sheriff (Enoch George) announced he was going to (retire), he (Rowland) told me that now was as good a time as any to run.\u201d\n\nSharon Sisk said that when Rowland told his childhood neighbors he was running for sheriff, she told him she would pray that he would get elected if God saw fit for him to hold that position. But if being in office would change Rowland for the worse, she said, she prayed he would not be elected.\n\nRowland captured nearly 30 percent of the vote for sheriff two weeks ago, enough to clinch the office in a race with five candidates.\n\n\u201cYou are your choices,\u201d Rowland says as he motions to the campaign signs in his truck. \u201cHow I live my life and what I hope to accomplish as sheriff is to leave people better than I find them. I just want to use what has been entrusted to me to help others.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "In the bed of Bucky Rowland\u2019s pickup truck are signs from his recent successful campaign for Maury County Sheriff.
