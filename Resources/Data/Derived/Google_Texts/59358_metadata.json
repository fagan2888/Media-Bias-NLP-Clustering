Peter Shumlin said on Vermont Edition Nov. 1 that he was unaware of problems with the exchange until after Labor Day. But a May 22 report advised top officials in the Department of Vermont Health Access to \u201celevate missed deliverable dates or milestones to highest levels within the State and CGI.\u201d\n\nApril 24, 2013: \"Thus, a go forward decision for the Medicaid capabilities being requested and the [redacted] required are being made without really knowing all the risks - which is a real red flag to meeting the October date.\"\n\nCGI Technologies and Solutions, the contractor the state hired to build the exchange, repeatedly missed deadlines, shifted due dates and failed to effectively communicate, the reports show.\n\nState Auditor Doug Hoffer said the reports raised \u201ca number of interesting questions\u201d and confirmed Tuesday that he plans to conduct a performance audit of \u201cDVHA and/or CGI contracts.\u201d\n\nThe reports were issued by Gartner Consulting, a Stamford, Conn. firm hired to assist the state in quality assurance and contractor oversight for the build-out of the state\u2019s health care exchange. The bi-weekly quality assurance reports use a color-coded system to define the risk presented by a given issue, such as a missed deadline or staffing shortages.\n\nStarting on April 24, and continuing through Sept. 29, every report contained a page asserting that the entire health care exchange project should be considered \u201cHIGH RISK\u201d or \u201cRED status due to unresolved risks to meeting the October 1 deadline for Go-Live.\u201d\n\nRobin Lunge, director of Health Care Reform for the Shumlin administration, said the project was rated as red from the beginning due to the ambitious deadline mandated by the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cAll states knew that Oct. 1 was an aggressive deadline, and the project was considered challenging because of that deadline. The various risk areas that Gartner would identify would be discussed and handled by the project team working on that project, and they would work with Gartner to understand what the concern was, make sure we fully understood it,\u201d then go to work fixing it, Lunge said.\n\nVermont has received $172 million from the federal government to design, build and implement the exchange. The state has an $84 million, three-year contract with CGI to do the bulk of the work.\n\nMay 22, 2013 (Recommended Action): \"Escalate missed deliverable dates or milestones to highest levels within the state and CGI.\"\n\nThe website for Vermont Health Connect launched on schedule Oct. 1. But it failed repeatedly in the beginning, and experienced other technical glitches in the following weeks. Some of those problems have been fixed, but the electronic payment system is still not working.\n\nState officials recently told CGI that Vermont is preparing to withhold $5 million under the contract because of problems with the exchange. (Officials say the state actually incurred $26 million in damages, but the contract limits the amount the state can hold back to $5 million.)\n\nA spokesperson for CGI was not available for comment Tuesday due to an ice storm in the Washington, D.C. area.\n\nLunge said the Gartner reports that gave early warnings were only one side of the story. CGI also produced weekly reports, which she said responded to issues Gartner raised. VPR requested all 2013 reports related to rollout of the exchange, including the CGI documents. Despite statutory time limits set out in the state\u2019s access to public records law, the Department of Vermont Health Access has not yet released the CGI reports, Lunge said, because CGI is in the process of redacting them.\n\nCrashing deadlines\n\nThe Oct. 1 deadline for the launch of the exchange came up early and often in the reports. The April 24 report mentioned \u201ca real red flag to meeting the October date.\u201d\n\nThe same report told state officials to tamp down their expectations for the exchange\u2019s user experience.\n\n\u201cGartner understand (sic) it would be nice to have more functionality in October and that it would make the user interface for both HBE [Health Benefits Exchange] and Medicaid much better,\u201d the report said. \u201cBut it would seem this is a time to think of \u2018must haves\u2019 and not \u2018nice to have.\u2019\u201d\n\nJune 19, 2013: \"No comprehensive test approach or plan [has] been published or approved, and the full extent of required testing is unknown.\"\n\nSoon after that, problems with internal deadlines and quality control began to dominate Gartner\u2019s reports. A May 14 report warned that there \u201cappear[ed] to be very little control over changes in the project schedule, deliverables, or scope. Potential impact to other project areas \u2013 both internal and external \u2013 are not analyzed or alternatives presented.\u201d\n\nThat concern was realized in the next report, which said that in \u201crecent project schedule updates from CGI, a number of project deliverables have been shifted out to the future without having gone through a Change Management process.\u201d Such a process would ensure that changed deadlines were \u201cinstitutionalized,\u201d Lunge said, and that any necessary changes were made to the contract.\n\nThe May 14 report also said the \u201cdevelopment environment\u201d for the exchange \u2013 akin to a virtual tool shop that developers use to build the final project \u2013 was overdue.\n\n\u201cA delay in any environment being made available presents a risk to the project timeline, which has very little or no slack available,\u201d the report said.\n\nOver the following two weeks, that concern became an issue, and the May 22 report said the environment \u201cis not yet fully configured or available.\u201d\n\nGartner\u2019s May 22 report also said the CGI weekly updates \u2013 the documents Lunge said will tell CGI\u2019s side of the story \u2013 lacked detail on quality assurance issues.\n\n\u201cA large-scale, highly-integrated and complex project such as the HBE [Health Benefits Exchange] demands constant coordination and communication between stakeholders,\u201d the Gartner document says. But that goal was \u201cnot accomplished with the current CGI status report.\u201d\n\nJuly 17, 2013: \"While this approach allows for the maximum user testing time there is a risk that incomplete or non-functional system elements will be presented to users.\"\n\nBy July, Gartner\u2019s concerns had turned to testing protocols for the new information technology system with the consultants issuing reports that flagged testing as a serious issue. By Sept. 28, it was clear the exchange launch wasn\u2019t likely to go smoothly.\n\n\u201cMissed delivery dates and milestones, especially delays in environment availability, delayed testing to the point that functionality may be deployed with minimal testing,\u201d said the last report before the exchange launched Oct. 1.\n\nWho got the warnings?\n\nAccording to Lunge, the Gartner reports were sent to four state officials by email: DVHA Deputy Commissioner Lindsey Tucker, DVHA Director of Change Management Justin Tease, Department of Information and Innovation Enterprise Project Management Director Tom Jenny and Beth Rowley, a manager in the state\u2019s Agency of Human Services.\n\nThe May 22 report advising these officials to send an issue to the \u201chighest levels\u201d probably never reached Shumlin, Lunge said.\n\nSeptember 28, 2013: \"Missed delivery dates and milestones, especially delays in environment availability, delayed testing to the point that functionality may be deployed with minimal testing.\"\n\nLunge said this problem likely stayed within the Department of Vermont Health Access and was handled by Commissioner Mark Larson along with Tucker.\n\nFrequent reports of missed deadlines by contractors, Lunge said, ultimately made the project work better.\n\n\u201cI think the appropriate comparison point would\u2019ve been \u2018What happened in other states where they didn\u2019t identify these risks?\u2019\u201d Lunge said. \u201cDid they do better than us, did they do worse than us? I think what you would see if you did that comparison is that other states who weren\u2019t aggressively managing their vendor would have ended up with even more serious problems than Vermont did.\u201d\n\nGov. Shumlin was asked directly what he knew, and when, about problems with Vermont Health Connect. A caller to VPR\u2019s Vermont Edition on Nov. 1 said he heard from people working on the project in July that the health care exchange was way behind schedule. Shumlin said he had not received the same information.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know who your sources are,\u201d Shumlin said, \u201cbut I didn\u2019t have the same information that you had, let\u2019s just put it that way.\u201d\n\nUpdate 12/19/2013: In response to requests for comment on this story, CGI Vice President of Global Communications Linda Odorisio issued the following statement by email:", "article_metadata": {"category": "VPR News", "description": "The Shumlin administration was warned repeatedly over the past year that staffing shortages, technical problems and other issues with its main contractor", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://digital.vpr.net/post/shumlin-administration-had-red-flag-warnings-about-health-exchange-early-and-often", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/vpr/files/styles/medium/public/201312/vpr-healthcare-rollout-vt_0.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The Shumlin administration was warned repeatedly over the past year that staffing shortages, technical problems and other issues with its main contractor", "title": "Shumlin Administration Had 'Red Flag' Warnings About Health Exchange Early And Often"}, "story_id": 250046213, "twitter": {"site": "@vprnet", "card": "summary", "creator": "@taylordobbs"}, "author": "Taylor Dobbs", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Shumlin Administration Had &#039;Red Flag&#039; Warnings About Health Exchange Early And Often"}, "nid": 21205, "datePublished": "2013-12-10", "keywords": "VPR News, Health Care Exchange, Health Care", "wordCount": 1568, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2102\"", "article_summary": "The Shumlin administration was warned repeatedly over the past year that staffing shortages, technical problems and other issues with its main contractor threatened the launch of the state\u2019s health exchange, documents show.\nShumlin was asked directly what he knew, and when, about problems with Vermont Health Connect.\nA series of reports prepared for the Department of Vermont Health Access highlight continuous and growing concerns about the state\u2019s ability to launch Vermont Health Connect on time, dating back to early this summer.\nThe website for Vermont Health Connect launched on schedule Oct. 1.\nLunge said this problem likely stayed within the Department of Vermont Health Access and was handled by Commissioner Mark Larson along with Tucker."}
