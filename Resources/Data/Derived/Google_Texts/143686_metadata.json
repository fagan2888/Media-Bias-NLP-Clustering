Tom Price, whose sixth congressional district includes portions of Brookhaven, Chamblee, Dunwoody, Sandy Springs, Alpharetta, Johns Creek, Tucker and Roswell.\n\nShortly after news broke of Boehner\u2019s plans, Charlie Harper, founder of the political blog Peach Pundit, speculated that Price could be in line for a more prominent GOP leadership role on Capitol Hill.\n\n\u201cPrice works well with members across the GOP spectrum,\u201d Harper wrote. \u201c He\u2019s chaired the conservative Republican Study Committee and the House Policy Committee. He\u2019s currently the House Budget Chairman, and has put forth the only workable House alternative to the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nIf House conservatives rally around House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Harper said, \u201cthe race for speaker may be relatively short. If there is dissension or open rebellion, all bets are off ... Perhaps Price will have the opportunity to clean up that mess.\u201d\n\nPrice has also been mentioned as one of several Republicans who could be in line for the job should Boehner resign. Price passed on Georgia\u2019s open U.S. Senate race in 2014, choosing to remain in the House.\n\n\u201cSpeaker John Boehner has served the House of Representatives with honor,\u201d Price said in a statement released late Friday morning. \u201cHe has served at a time of tremendous challenges, and he has always maintained an admirable and healthy sense of purpose and perspective. I thank John and his family for that service, and wish them well in the days ahead.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Dunwoody, GA Patch", "description": "Maybe, according to one political blog.", "title": "Tom Price ...
