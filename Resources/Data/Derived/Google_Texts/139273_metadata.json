And estate tax revenue is falling, not rising. In 2001 the tax collected nearly twice as much money as 2013 ($23.5 billion).\n\nThis $12.7 billion raised was out of about $2.8 trillion in total federal revenue in 2013. In other words, a trivial 0.46 percent of federal tax receipts now comes from estates.\n\nIts impact on the federal deficit is minimal. If we got rid of the estate tax altogether, the feds, at worst, would still collect more than 99 percent of all federal revenue.\n\nWhy does the tax raise such a pittance, compared with income taxes, business taxes, even customs duties? It\u2019s partly because the exemption level was raised to $5 million, indexed for inflation (rising to $5.43 million this year) as part of the tax deal in 2012.\n\nThe tax rate was also cut to 40 percent from 55 percent. But the other factor that appears to be driving lower collections is that wealthy Americans are getting savvier in avoiding the tax.\n\nWhich brings us to the stupendous inefficiency of the tax. In 2013, only 4,687 estates paid any estate tax. This was about one-fifth of a percentage point of all deaths that year. Yet nearly every medium-sized estate has to waste time and money filling out catalogs of tax forms.\n\nThe joke in legal circles today is that we have an estate tax not to raise money, but to keep thousands of accountants and lawyers in jobs.\n\nThe common objection screamed from the rooftops to eliminating this tax is: tax cuts for rich trust fund babies.\n\nActually, no. Most of the billionaire households\u2014Gates, Buffett, Rockefeller, etc.\u2014will pay almost no estate tax. In the case of Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, billions of dollars of their wealth is sheltered from the IRS through the creation of tax-exempt entities like the Gates Foundation.\n\nIn many cases, the income parked there will never be taxed, neither while they are alive nor after they are dead\u2014thanks to this mother of all tax shelters.\n\nDick Patten, who runs a coalition of family business owners dedicated to ending the death tax, reminds me that the third plank of Karl Marx\u2019s and Friedrich Engels\u2019 \u201cThe Communist Manifesto\u201d was to abolish all rights of inheritance.\n\n\u201cWith a 100 percent inheritance tax, the government eventually owns everything. That\u2019s the point, right?\u201d And with an effective federal 57 percent inheritance tax, as President Obama has proposed, the government, in some cases, owns more than half.\n\nMost of the billionaire households\u2014Gates, Buffett, Rockefeller, etc.\u2014will pay almost no estate tax.\n\nThis is all so economically self-defeating. Nobel laureate economist Joseph Stiglitz, who served as chairman on Bill Clinton\u2019s Council of Economic Advisors, once found in a research paper that the estate tax may increase inequality by reducing savings and driving up returns on capital.\n\nFormer Clinton Treasury Secretary and Obama economic adviser Larry Summers co-authored a 1981 study finding that the estate tax reduces capital formation. And a 2012 study by the Joint Economic Committee\u2019s Republicans showed that the estate tax, since its inception nearly a century ago, has reduced the capital stock by approximately $1.1 trillion.\n\nThe major propeller of growth in a nation is that one generation after another leaves wealth to the next. This makes societies richer over time as trillions of dollars of wealth are passed to children and grandchildren.\n\nThe higher the estate tax rate, the less the incentive for wealth creation in the first place. The incentive is to die broke\u2014in which case future generations get nothing, but the government gets shut out, too. This is called a lose-lose for everyone.\n\nAmazingly, many socialist or former communist nations, like Sweden and Russia, have eliminated their death taxes. They found the tax to be economically counterproductive. America should do the same\u2014at almost no cost to the Treasury, according to the new revenue numbers, and maybe even a big gain.\n\nOriginally published in the Orange County Register.", "article_metadata": {"description": "If there were ever a right time to eliminate the estate tax in America, it is right now.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "If there were ever a right time to eliminate the estate tax in America, it is right now.", "title": "It's Time to Kill This Tax (Entirely)", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock_000006128165_Large.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-03-02T17:12:42+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1DLlM0j"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "If there were ever a right time to eliminate the estate tax in America, it is right now.", "title": "It's Time to Kill This Tax (Entirely)", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock_000006128165_Large.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "taxes", "published_time": "2015-03-01T03:01:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-02T17:12:42+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "estate tax, federal taxes, Larry Summers, IRS, Dick Pattern, Joseph Stiglitz"}, "article_summary": "Here is what the latest IRS numbers tell us: In 2013, the estate tax raised $12.7 billion.\nThe common objection screamed from the rooftops to eliminating this tax is: tax cuts for rich trust fund babies.\nAnd estate tax revenue is falling, not rising.\nIn other words, a trivial 0.46 percent of federal tax receipts now comes from estates.\nFormer Clinton Treasury Secretary and Obama economic adviser Larry Summers co-authored a 1981 study finding that the estate tax reduces capital formation."}
