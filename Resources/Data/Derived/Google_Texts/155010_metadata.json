Football and other sports were shut down in 1984 as a cost-cutting measure. Upon football\u2019s return to competition in 2008, the ThunderWolves have been a national power and have a 48-4 record over the last four years.\n\nThe program had been knocking on the door of national success in that time, and Saturday, CSU-Pueblo finished the job.\n\n\u201cTo be able to come through in the end like this, it\u2019s beautiful,\u201d said Widefield product Paul Browning, a senior wide receiver who scored the only touchdown.\n\nCSU-Pueblo (14-1) rode its stout defense, holding Minnesota State (14-1) to 265 total yards before a crowd of 6,762. The Mavericks were shut out for the first time since 2004, a span of 128 games.\n\n\u201cThey played outstanding,\u201d Wristen said of his players.\n\nThe ThunderWolves were motivated too. Wristen made sure his team knew that Minnesota State entered the game ranked first nationally in scoring defense.\n\nThe ThunderWolves also can play great defense. That was the message on display throughout the game at Sporting Park.\n\nAfter CSU-Pueblo missed a field goal late in the first quarter, Minnesota State responded with its best drive of the game, reaching the ThunderWolves\u2019 8-yard line.\n\nThe Mavericks were at the 11 when they lined up for a 27-yard field goal. CSU-Pueblo\u2019s Josh Bredl broke through for the block.\n\n\u201cThat was a huge momentum change,\u201d Wristen said. \u201cWe kind of got going there.\u201d\n\nAfter the blocked kick, running back Cameron McDondle started getting yards in chunks. His 34-yard gain set up the game\u2019s first score, a 27-yard field goal by Greg O\u2019Donnell. McDondle finished with 113 yards rushing and surpassed 2,000 yards for the season.\n\nWhen they got the ball back, the ThunderWolves reached the Mavs\u2019 18 and quarterback Chris Bonner lofted a perfect strike to Browning down the sideline for the game\u2019s only touchdown.\n\n\u201cI just saw a good matchup out there with Paul and anytime I\u2019ve seen that this year, I know if I give him a chance to go out and get it he will,\u201d Bonner said.\n\nO\u2019Donnell\u2019s 24-yard field goal early in the third quarter made it 13-0.\n\nThe ThunderWolves pitched the first shutout in a Division II championship game since 1997.\n\n\u201cOur defense was outstanding, and our offense made the plays they needed to make to win the game,\u201d Wristen said. \u201cWe\u2019re here and we finished it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "CSU-Pueblo beats Minnesota State to win Division II championship", "title": "CSU-Pueblo beats Minnesota State to win Division II championship", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/12/20/csu-pueblo-beats-minnesota-state-to-win-division-ii-championship/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141220_071816_csu-pueblo.jpg", "height": 410}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141220_071816_csu-pueblo.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-20T17:26:34+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T08:07:10+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Colorado State University"}, "article_summary": "\u201cOur defense was outstanding, and our offense made the plays they needed to make to win the game,\u201d Wristen said.\nCSU-Pueblo (14-1) rode its stout defense, holding Minnesota State (14-1) to 265 total yards before a crowd of 6,762.\nAnd the ThunderWolves didn\u2019t wait until the final gun to begin the celebration of their NCAA Division II title with a 13-0 victory over Minnesota State on Saturday.\nWristen made sure his team knew that Minnesota State entered the game ranked first nationally in scoring defense.\nHis 34-yard gain set up the game\u2019s first score, a 27-yard field goal by Greg O\u2019Donnell."}
