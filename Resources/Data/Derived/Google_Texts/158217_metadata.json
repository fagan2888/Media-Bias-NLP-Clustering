After all, the shooter, Dylann Roof, had declared in his alleged manifesto, that \u201cWe have no skinheads, no real KKK, no one doing anything but talking on the Internet,\u201d when it came to racist support groups for his planned massacre of black people. The drug-abusing 21-year-old was complaining about a lack of organized support for his views.\n\nHad the SPLC dug up some new evidence? Indeed, where was the evidence that Roof was \u201cconnected\u201d to a global plot? SPLC President Richard Cohen informed his supporters in this email begging for financial support that \u201cthrough his symbols and writings, suspect Dylann Storm Roof has expressed sentiments that are uniting white supremacists across the world\u2014from the United States to Europe to Australia.\u201d His symbols and writings made him part of an international plot? Is this the best the SPLC can do?\n\nWelcome to the world of the Southern Poverty Law Center, the media\u2019s designated \u201cexperts\u201d on right-wing extremism. The SPLC \u201ctracks hate groups\u201d is the usual claim in the media. In fact, it helped inspire an actual terrorist attack on the Washington, D.C. offices of the conservative Christian Family Research Council (FRC), after a gay militant discovered the location of the FRC on an SPLC \u201chate map.\u201d A security guard was wounded before he succeeded in taking down the attacker.\n\n\u201cThank you [for] supporting this vital fight against hate and extremism,\u201d said Cohen in the fundraising letter exploiting the Roof case. They are desperate to add to their $245.3 million financial endowment.\n\nAt the top of the email message was a \u201cDONATE\u201d button. Readers were also told they could become a financial \u201cpartner\u201d through a planned gift, or a \u201cfriend of the Center\u201d through monthly giving.\n\nOn the same day that Cohen inflated the facts in the Roof case in a crass appeal for money, he and his associate, Morris Dees, had written an op-ed for The New York Times including similar exaggerations. The piece, headlined, \u201cWhite Supremacists Without Borders,\u201d insisted that the \u201cthemes\u201d adopted by the killer were \u201csigns of the growing globalization of white nationalism.\u201d The term \u201cglobalization\u201d can apply to just about anything on the Internet, since that technology is international in scope. That was good enough for those who procure and place op-eds at The New York Times.\n\n\u201cWhen we think of the Islamist terrorism of groups like Al Qaeda and the Islamic State, we recognize their international dimension,\u201d said Dees and Cohen. \u201cWhen it comes to far-right domestic terrorism, we don\u2019t.\u201d Perhaps that is because the \u201cevidence\u201d of Roof\u2019s international connections is thin, if not non-existent. Indeed, as noted, Roof complains in the manifesto about the absence of even local grassroots support for his cause in the supposedly racist enclave of South Carolina.\n\nThe only evidence of an international connection, not mentioned by Cohen or Dees, is that several in the media have determined through a simple search on the Internet that Roof\u2019s website was hosted by a Russian server, apparently located in Moscow. At a time of news about Russian and Chinese hackers getting access to federal and other websites in the U.S., this seems mighty interesting and newsworthy. Does this mean that Russian interests had advance knowledge of Roof\u2019s manifesto and murder plans? This seems worthy of follow-up, but is not mentioned by the SPLC in its Times op-ed.\n\nThe op-ed ignores the real hard evidence of the international connections of the white supremacist movement in the form of former KKK leader David Duke once traveling to Russia and meeting with Alexander Dugin, a one-time adviser to Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s United Russia Party. We reported on this connection back in March of last year. Duke called Dugin \u201cone of the leading intellectuals of Russia\u2019s patriotic movement.\u201d The SPLC is aware of Dugin, having published an article noting that he \u201chas close ties to the Kremlin\u201d and \u201csupports a Eurasian empire made up of Russia and former Soviet republics such as the Ukraine and set against \u2018North Atlantic interests.\u2019\u201d But it calls him a \u201cfascist,\u201d rather than a staunch ally of Putin and advocate of Russian imperialism.\n\nThe SPLC did report previously on what it termed a \u201cRussian White Nationalist Conference\u201d held in St. Petersburg, Russia, in March of this year, with various foreign groups and individuals in attendance. Strangely, however, there is no evidence that the SPLC seriously investigated a possible Russian connection to any of this in the Dylann Roof case. Instead, it claims a foreign connection through images and themes he invoked, a very weak case to present to the Times\u2019 readers.\n\nEuromaidan Press, a voice for Ukraine\u2019s anti-Russian activists, reported extensively on the St. Petersburg conference, even publishing the names of those attending the event. An article noted \u201c\u2026the prevalence of statements in support of Russia and Putin in particular as the true conservatives that can save the world,\u201d citing \u201cquotes from now infamous speeches of Putin\u2019s in which he talks of the emergence of nationalism and conservatism as a natural expression of Russian patriotism.\u201d\n\nAs we have argued in the past, however, Putin\u2019s alleged conservatism is a grand deception, designed to lure conservatives around the world into supporting Russian aggression. Putin has never given up his old KGB and Soviet ways.\n\nIn their op-ed, Cohen and Dees said, \u201cEurope has also seen the rise of a powerful, far-right political movement that rejects multiculturalism. The anti-Semitic Jobbik Party in Hungary and the neo-fascist Golden Dawn in Greece are prime examples. In Germany, there has been a series of murders by neo-Nazis. Britain, too, is experiencing an upswing of nationalist, anti-immigrant politics.\u201d\n\nLeft unsaid in the case of Greece is that the new left-wing ruling party, Syriza, is pro-Russia and anti-Western, and that Vladimir Putin has promised financial assistance if the European Union balks at another economic bailout.\n\nIt turns out that the SPLC has been conned by the Russians in the past. SPLC staffer Mark Potok, described by the group as a \u201cleading expert\u201d on extremism, actually appeared as a guest on Putin\u2019s TV channel, Russia Today. Embarrassed over this fact, the group later published a \u201cFull disclosure\u201d disclaimer, noting that Potok had appeared on an edition of Russia Today\u2019s \u201cCrossTalk\u201d program to discuss the rise of militias in the U.S. The SPLC then belatedly began to take note of the channel\u2019s anti-American propaganda and disinformation campaigns.\n\nPotok, their expert, apparently didn\u2019t understand\u2014or didn\u2019t care\u2014that Russia Today TV was actually linked to Russia and the Russian government. His expertise is clearly lacking about Russian influence operations.\n\nWe see similar blindness regarding other threats.\n\n\u201cWe know Islamic terrorists are thinking globally, and we confront that threat,\u201d Dees and Cohen declare in their Times op-ed. \u201cWe\u2019ve been too slow to realize that white supremacists are doing the same.\u201d The SPLC has been way too slow to investigate the Russian connection to the white supremacists it claims to be so concerned about. There is certainly no evidence of what they have uncovered in that Times op-ed.\n\nAs far as Islamic terrorists are concerned, the SPLC turns things around by targeting the critics of radical Islam. A simple search of the group\u2019s website brings forth several stories about the dangers allegedly posed by \u201cIslamophobes,\u201d not the terrorists themselves. Consider the article that begins, \u201cIn the weeks following the terrorist attacks in France, major players in the American anti-Muslim movement have unleashed a tirade of bigotry and renewed their energies in attacking the federal government. But not to be left out, prominent anti-immigrant figures and politicians have also joined the show.\u201d\n\nThis is typical of how the SPLC operates. The problem is not radical Islam trying to kill Americans or others. Rather, the problem is the people who focus on the threat and want the federal government to protect the American people from the threat. Hence, Pamela Geller, later targeted in a terrorist attack on American soil, was an \u201cIslamophobe,\u201d according to the SPLC and the Council on American-Islamic Relations. The term is usually applied to anyone who suggests taking the threat of Islamic terrorism seriously and takes action against it.\n\nBy attempting to orchestrate the coverage of terrorism in such a way as to ignore the threat posed by the terrorists themselves, the SPLC employs the tactic of \u201cpartisan tolerance,\u201d meaning that the conservatives who want to protect America and its allies from Islamic terrorists or Russian aggression become the problem. This is why Dylann Roof must be transformed by the SPLC from a drug-abusing loner into a global right-wing terrorist. It is political exploitation of a national tragedy that confuses and misleads the nation.\n\nIt\u2019s shocking that the major media continue to take the SPLC seriously. Liberal media bias helps explain, but not justify, this curious state of affairs. Another factor has to be laziness on the part of reporters, who don\u2019t want to take the time to do their own research or work. It\u2019s easier to cite the \u201cexperts,\u201d even if they are frauds and con men.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Accuracy In Media", "description": "On the same day that Cohen inflated the facts in the Roof case in a crass appeal for money, he and his associate, Morris Dees, had written an op-ed for The New York Times including similar exaggerations.", "title": "A Russian Link to the Charleston Massacre?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.aim.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/we-ask-a-legal-expert-whether-dylann-roof-could-face-terrorism-charges-732-body-image-1434727204.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-06-23T17:39:40+00:00", "url": "http://www.aim.org/aim-column/a-russian-link-to-the-charleston-massacre/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/AccuracyInMedia/", "section": "AIM Column", "published_time": "2015-06-23T17:39:40+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-23T17:39:40+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "On the same day that Cohen inflated the facts in the Roof case in a crass appeal for money, he and his associate, Morris Dees, had written an op-ed for The New York Times including similar exaggerations.", "title": "A Russian Link to the Charleston Massacre?", "url": "http://www.aim.org/aim-column/a-russian-link-to-the-charleston-massacre/", "image": "http://www.aim.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/we-ask-a-legal-expert-whether-dylann-roof-could-face-terrorism-charges-732-body-image-1434727204.jpg", "site": "@AccuracyInMedia", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes"}, "article_summary": "Potok, their expert, apparently didn\u2019t understand\u2014or didn\u2019t care\u2014that Russia Today TV was actually linked to Russia and the Russian government.\nStrangely, however, there is no evidence that the SPLC seriously investigated a possible Russian connection to any of this in the Dylann Roof case.\n\u201cThank you [for] supporting this vital fight against hate and extremism,\u201d said Cohen in the fundraising letter exploiting the Roof case.\nThis is why Dylann Roof must be transformed by the SPLC from a drug-abusing loner into a global right-wing terrorist.\nDoes this mean that Russian interests had advance knowledge of Roof\u2019s manifesto and murder plans?"}
