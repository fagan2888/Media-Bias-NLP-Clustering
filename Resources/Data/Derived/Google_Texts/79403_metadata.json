The Avalanche returned early Sunday morning and had the rest of the day off. Practice Monday and the second home game is Tuesday against the visiting Florida Panthers.\n\nCenter Matt Duchene appears to have an excellent handle on what ails this team. Inadequate offense one night, inadequate defense the next. Inconsistency that affects what happens in all three zone. The lone win came Monday at Boston, and the offense struggled in that 2-1 affair. Defending was poor Thursday at Ottawa and Saturday at Montreal, and Colorado blew its first of three consecutive leads in Tuesday\u2019s overtime loss at Toronto. Goals for/against: 9/20.\n\nThe Avs are 1-4-1 \u2014 just a year after beginning 6-0.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re not scoring you tighten up as a group and you\u2019re not able to defend as well, because you\u2019re tight,\u201d Duchene told me Saturday after the 3-2 loss to the Canadiens. \u201cI think that\u2019s our case right now. (But) we\u2019re fine. We\u2019re going to be OK. We\u2019re right there every night; it\u2019s not like we\u2019re getting blown out or anything. Right now we\u2019re just sabotaging ourselves. I don\u2019t think it has anything to do with other teams. They\u2019re playing well but we\u2019re sabotaging ourselves.\u201d\n\nMore on what Duchene said after his 10-shot performance against the Habs in the game story.\n\nAlso, Terry Frei has a column in Monday\u2019s paper/online. We will link that here when it posts.\n\nDuchene\u2019s left wing, Jamie McGinn, had this to say: \u201cWe had lots of chances. It\u2019s unfortunate because, we had a lot of shots but we didn\u2019t play to our potential. We gave up too many good rushes to them, where \u201cPick\u201d (Calvin Pickard) kept us in it. Once they start coming (Avalanche goals), they\u2019re going to come in bunches. But we definitely have to tighten up defensively.\u201d\n\nQuinnipiac freshman Landon Smith could perhaps help the Avs offensively, next season or beyond. The standout from Greenwood Village has two goals and four points in his first three NCAA games, with his goals coming in Saturday\u2019s 3-3 tie against No. 9-ranked UMass-Lowell. Smith, who turned 21 Saturday, attended the Avs\u2019 prospects camp in July as a free agent and might not last more than a year or two in college, given his resume. He led the British Columbia Hockey League with 43 goals last season and was named the league\u2019s MVP, and was among six finalists as Canada\u2019s junior-A player of the year.\n\nHere\u2019s what QU coach Rand Pecknold said after Saturday\u2019s game: \u201cLandon Smith was really good tonight. He played great \u2014 he had a lot of jump. He\u2019s certainly a highly talented kid.\u201d\n\nOur own Nick Groke (@NickGroke) has Avalanche practice Monday.", "article_metadata": {"Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "All Things Avalanche", "description": "Colorado Avalanche center Matt Duchene says the 1-4-1 start will get turned around.", "title": "Avs center Matt Duchene: \"Right now we're just sabotaging ourselves\"", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/2014/10/19/matt-duchene-right-now-just-sabotaging/19820/", "image": "http://local.denverpost.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/denverpost.png?v=21060130", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Colorado Avalanche center Matt Duchene says the 1-4-1 start will get turned around.", "creator": "@mikechambers", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/2014/10/19/matt-duchene-right-now-just-sabotaging/19820/", "image": "http://local.denverpost.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/denverpost.png?v=21060130", "title": "Avs center Matt Duchene: \u201cRight now we\u2019re just sabotaging ourselves\u201d", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "follow, all", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Colorado Avalanche,Jamie McGinn,Landon Smith,Matt Duchene,Quinnipiac"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde4d6\"", "article_summary": "Right now we\u2019re just sabotaging ourselves.\nWe\u2019re going to be OK.
