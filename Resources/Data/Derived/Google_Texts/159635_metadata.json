The other six kids in our apartment that week\u2014me, my sister, and my four cousins\u2014didn\u2019t flap our hands in front of our faces for hours or say \u201cEeeee\u201d instead of words. Until then I\u2019d convinced myself that my brother was just \u201cslow,\u201d like my parents said, and that, like my dad, he\u2019d be a late talker. But my cousins looked at my brother as if he had six heads, and by the middle of their visit, I did too. He wouldn\u2019t be diagnosed with autism for another two years because there weren\u2019t many doctors in our area who knew what it was. And even after he was diagnosed, we spent weekends driving the hour and a half between Milwaukee and our hometown of Madison, Wisconsin, in search of doctors who knew how to treat it. My parents\u2019 search for treatment, and possibly a cure, for my brother sent us not just from city to city but through theory after theory. They eliminated sugar, dairy, and gluten from my brother\u2019s diet and added alternative \u201cvitamins\u201d like kava kava and valerian in an attempt to get him to sit still for more than a second or two. After I tried his vitamins out of curiosity I understood why he grimaced as he swallowed them: They tasted like a sour mix of grass and dirt.\n\nMusic therapy, where my brother wore a special set of headphones so he could listen to what sounded like static for an hour a day, was supposed to cut down on his hand-flapping and help him talk more. While my brother\u2019s behavioral therapists taught him some language and the ability to follow basic commands like \u201csit down,\u201d \u201chands in lap,\u201d and \u201ccome here,\u201d I\u2019m not sure what any of the rest of these treatment methods accomplished. But the community my parents built\u2014of autism doctors, therapists, and fellow parents of autistic kids\u2014seemed to \u201cdiscover\u201d a treatment or \u201ccure\u201d every five minutes, even if most of them were discredited in the sixth minute. In the late 90s, this community turned against vaccines. My parents\u2019 search for treatment for my brother sent us from city to city, through theory after theory. Andrew Wakefield famously \u201cdiscovered\u201d a link between the MMR (measles-mumps-rubella) vaccine and autism in 1998 that has since been discredited, but from 1998 until 2004, when 10 of the paper\u2019s 12 authors retracted the study, his findings were, at least in some circles, considered credible science. My family and I were thrilled about Wakefield\u2019s \u201cdiscovery.\u201d If vaccines were the problem, autism could be prevented, even if it couldn\u2019t be cured. I wanted to have kids someday and I knew that autism tended to run in families. So I was thrilled to think that if I didn\u2019t give my future kid an MMR shot, he or she would never develop autism. Wakefield only discussed MMR, but I grew suspicious of all vaccines. If one vaccine was dangerous, weren\u2019t they all? Wakefield lost his medical license in 2010 when Britain\u2019s medical-licensing council found that his study was dishonest and that he\u2019d mistreated developmentally challenged children in the course of his research. Yet instead of feeling relieved that I could rule vaccines out as a potential cause of autism, I felt cheated. I couldn\u2019t accept the truth: In the 15 years since my brother\u2019s diagnosis, no one had figured out what causes autism, so there was nothing I could do to prevent having an autistic child. I held on to my opposition, figuring I should avoid vaccinating my future kid \u201cjust in case.\u201d I wanted to believe that I could control whether my future kid would be autistic or not. I had witnessed my parents, their friends with autistic kids, and my brother\u2019s doctors navigate a labyrinth of shifting medical-insurance coverages and autism-treatment fads, hoping to improve their kids\u2019 social and language skills enough to let them hold a job or live in a group home. I knew I didn\u2019t want to have a kid who couldn\u2019t talk if I could avoid it.", "article_metadata": {"description": "I used to believe that vaccines played a role in my brother&#39;s autism\u2014until becoming a mother changed my mind.", "author": "Kashana Cauley", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "I used to believe that vaccines played a role in my brother&#39;s autism\u2014until becoming a mother changed my mind.", "title": "I Used to Be an Anti-Vaxer", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2015/02/3698041449_df58b1c2e2_b/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/03/i-used-to-be-an-anti-vaxer/385786/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "My parents\u2019 search for treatment for my brother sent us from city to city, through theory after theory.\nHe wouldn\u2019t be diagnosed with autism for another two years because there weren\u2019t many doctors in our area who knew what it was.\nMy parents\u2019 search for treatment, and possibly a cure, for my brother sent us not just from city to city but through theory after theory.\nI wanted to have kids someday and I knew that autism tended to run in families.\nYet instead of feeling relieved that I could rule vaccines out as a potential cause of autism, I felt cheated."}
