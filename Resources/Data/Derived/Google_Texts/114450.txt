The Broncos announced Sunday that they signed rookie offensive tackle Charles Sweeton and waived injured tackle Connor Rains.

Rains, a college free agent out of Wyoming, hurt his foot during Friday’s training camp practice and was placed on the waived/injured list.

Sweeton is a 6-foot-5, 291-pound tackle from the University of Tennessee-Martin. He was a four-year starter and a first-team Ohio Valley Conference selection as a senior last year. He was initially signed by Kansas City in May as a college free agent before being released a week later.

After wide receiver Kyle Williams ruptured his Achilles’ tendon Saturday, the Broncos had yet another gap to fill. They worked out rookie Nigel King, but elected not to sign him, according to an NFL source.

King, a 6-foot-3, 210-pound rookie out of Kansas, had 30 receptions for 537 yards and one touchdown as a redshirt junior for the Jayhawks last season. He signed with the Miami Dolphins in May and competed in mini camp and organized team activities before being waived on Monday.
