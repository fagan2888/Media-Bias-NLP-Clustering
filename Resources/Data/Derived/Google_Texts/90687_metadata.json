(AP) \u2014 The U.S. Air Force is being criticized for a decision to relocate military air tanker equipment used to fight wildfires to Nevada instead of Montana.\n\nMontana Sen. Sen. Steve Daines sent a letter to the Air Force asking why Nevada was chosen for the Modular Airborne Firefighting Systems, which includes equipment that can be installed in C-130 cargo plans to drop retardant on wildfires.\n\nAccording to the Great Falls Tribune (http://tinyurl.com/z4yhu7g ), the system can be used by governors where the Air National Guard flight crews operate it. That also includes Wyoming. Colorado uses an Air Force Reserve Command unit. The Department of Defense provides the aircraft.\n\nA National Guard spokesman says all Air National Guard C-130 units were considered, including the Montana Air National Guard.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nInformation from: Great Falls Tribune, http://www.greatfallstribune.com", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Relocation of wildfire aircraft draws criticism", "title": "Relocation of wildfire aircraft draws criticism", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/04/09/relocation-of-wildfire-aircraft-draws-criticism/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-04-09T12:44:33+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-09T12:44:33+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "A National Guard spokesman says all Air National Guard C-130 units were considered, including the Montana Air National Guard.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014Information from: Great Falls Tribune, http://www.greatfallstribune.com\nGREAT FALLS, Mont.\nAccording to the Great Falls Tribune (http://tinyurl.com/z4yhu7g ), the system can be used by governors where the Air National Guard flight crews operate it.\nColorado uses an Air Force Reserve Command unit."}
