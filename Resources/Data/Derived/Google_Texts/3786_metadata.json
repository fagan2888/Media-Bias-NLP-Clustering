When asked if Egypt might provide airspace access or logistical support for airstrikes, he said, \u201cWe are completely committed to giving support. We will do whatever is required.\u201d\n\nBut he appeared to rule out sending troops, saying Iraq\u2019s military is strong enough to fight the militants and \u201cit\u2019s not a matter of ground troops from abroad.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "AP Interview: El-Sissi ready to back anti-IS fight", "author": "Hamza Hendawi, Ian Phillips and Lee Keath", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "AP Interview: El-Sissi ready to back anti-IS fight", "title": "AP Interview: El-Sissi ready to back anti-IS fight", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/09/20/ap_interview_el_sissi_ready_to_back_anti_is_fight/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/mideast-egypt-el-sissi.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "AP Interview: El-Sissi ready to back anti-IS fight", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/mideast-egypt-el-sissi.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "title": "AP Interview: El-Sissi ready to back anti-IS fight", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "AP Interview: El-Sissi ready to back anti-IS fight", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "El-Sissi did not elaborate on what support Egypt might give to the U.S.-led coalition aimed at fighting the extremist group.\n\u201cBut it was not clear (to others) until the events in Iraq and the Islamic State\u2019s sweep\u201d over much of that country.\nWhen asked if Egypt might provide airspace access or logistical support for airstrikes, he said, \u201cWe are completely committed to giving support.\nTopics: From the Wires, NewsCAIRO (AP) \u2014 Egypt\u2019s President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi told The Associated Press on Saturday he is prepared to give whatever support is needed in the fight against the Islamic State group but called for a \u201ccomprehensive strategy\u201d to tackle the roots of extremism across the region.\nWe will do whatever is required.\u201dBut he appeared to rule out sending troops, saying Iraq\u2019s military is strong enough to fight the militants and \u201cit\u2019s not a matter of ground troops from abroad.\u201d"}
