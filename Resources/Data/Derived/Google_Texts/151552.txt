Movie and television star Patty Duke left the University of Nebraska Medical Center, where she was treated for irritable bowel syndrome, Sunday.

Bruce Crawford, who brought Duke to Omaha for a Friday screening of “The Miracle Worker’’ at Joslyn Art Museum, said the Oscar-winning actress intended to complete her speaking tour.

Crawford said he spoke with Duke’s husband, Michael Pearce, who said his wife was feeling fine and ready to get back on the road.

“She wants people to know that she is feeling much better and that she thanks everyone for their concern,” Crawford said.

Crawford said Duke and her husband are traveling by car because they had been “doing some sightseeing.”

The actress spoke before the screening of the movie and later spent 90 minutes signing autographs in Witherspoon Concert Hall.

“She was fantastic at the event,” Crawford said. “You would never have known that she was in pain. She was sick and still demanded to go on the stage so she wouldn’t disappoint the people who came to see her.”

Crawford is a film historian, documentary producer and promoter and organizer of film tributes. The “Miracle Worker” screening was a benefit for the Omaha Parks Foundation.
