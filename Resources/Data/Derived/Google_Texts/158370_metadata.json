And yet they failed to fight.\u201d\n\nThen on Sunday, CIA Director John Brennan offered at best a perfunctory defense of the president\u2019s air-strike strategy. \u201cI believe firmly that we\u2019re not going to resolve this problem on the battle field,\u201d Brennan said during an appearance on CBS\u2019s Face the Nation. \u201cWe have to keep the pressure on them, but at the same time there has to be a viable political process that\u2019s able to bring together the actors inside Iraq and Syria and for them to be able to decide how they are going to have a .peaceful future. So it\u2019s a combination of military and political pressure that needs to be brought to bear.\u201d\n\nRelated: How ISIS Regained Its Momentum in Iraq\n\n\u201cWe will turn back ISIS, I have no doubt about it,\u201d Brennan said. \u201cBut I think there's going to be unfortunately a lot of bloodshed between now and then.\"\n\nLast September, Obama announced in a prime-time televised speech an open-ended campaign to combat the threat posed by the ISIS forces by greatly expanding a counterterrorism strategy and enlisting the support of scores of allies. The president said that the United States would join \u201cwith our friends and allies to degrade, and ultimately destroy, the terrorist group.\u201d\n\nWhile the administration can definitely cite a few important breakthroughs earlier this year, the terrorist group has become too entrenched and widespread to defeat in the near future.\n\nCongressional Republican leaders including Senate Armed Services Committee Chair John McCain (R-AZ) and House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) have been highly critical of the president\u2019s approach \u2013 including Obama\u2019s refusal to send in additional combat troops to help Iraq battle ISIS forces.\n\nYet congressional leaders have been unwilling to spell out a more aggressive strategy for the administration in new war powers legislation.\n\nRelated: Britain Hangs Back As the U.S. Pays $2.2 Billion to Fight ISIS\n\nFormer Florida governor Jeb Bush, who is expected to formally enter the race for the Republican presidential nomination later this month, said yesterday that the administration doesn\u2019t have a coherent strategy for victory, just \u201ca series of tactics reacting to whatever is going on the ground.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean we need to have combat troops in harm\u2019s way,\u201d he said on Face the Nation. \u201cBut I think in concert with other countries \u2013 and certainly in an effort to try to restrict Iranian influence in Iraq \u2013 that we can play a constructive role.\u201d\n\nISIS has made important gains in recent weeks, capturing the cities of Ramadi in Iraq and Palmyra in Syria.\n\nRelated: Why America\u2019s War with ISIS Will Take Years\n\nU.S. officials had been saying for several months that the U.S. air strikes were effective in degrading ISIS fighters in Iraq and that \u2013 under pressure from Iraqi forces \u2013 the terrorist group had lost as much as a quarter of the territory that it had amassed during lightning strikes last year, according to media reports. But the unexpected collapse and retreat of Iraqi forces in Ramadi proved to be a troubling eye-opener for Carter and other U.S. officials.\n\nBrennan disputed the idea that the U.S. intelligence community has been surprised or caught flat-footed by ISIS' strength, saying he reviewed the intelligence last week and that, \"we saw a growing strength.\"\n\n\"There are a lot of factors that come to play in terms of what gains they're able to make on the ground and as has been discussed, sometimes there are different Iraqi units that either don't have the leadership, the logistic support that they need in order to counter ISIS. And therefore it's looked at as a lack of a will to fight.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I must say that there has been a fair amount of intelligence about the growing capabilities of ISIS as well as the challenges that beset the Iraqi government, the sectarian tensions that continue to fuel a lot of these problems,\" he said.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Senior administration officials have now issued two warnings over the past week that t", "title": "Why a Military Victory Over ISIS Is Wishful Thinking", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/06/01/Why-Defeating-ISIS-Battle-May-Be-Pipe-Dream", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/07252014_ISIS.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/06/01/Why-Defeating-ISIS-Battle-May-Be-Pipe-Dream", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/07252014_ISIS.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Senior administration officials have now issued two warnings over the past week that t", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2944\"", "article_summary": "But the unexpected collapse and retreat of Iraqi forces in Ramadi proved to be a troubling eye-opener for Carter and other U.S. officials.\nSo it\u2019s a combination of military and political pressure that needs to be brought to bear.\u201dRelated: How ISIS Regained Its Momentum in Iraq\u201cWe will turn back ISIS, I have no doubt about it,\u201d Brennan said.\nRelated: U.S. Defense Chief Says Iraqi Forces Lacked Will to Fight Islamic State\u201cWhat apparently happened was that the Iraqi forces just showed no will to fight,\u201d Carter told CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d program a week ago.\nLast September, Obama announced in a prime-time televised speech an open-ended campaign to combat the threat posed by the ISIS forces by greatly expanding a counterterrorism strategy and enlisting the support of scores of allies.\nYet congressional leaders have been unwilling to spell out a more aggressive strategy for the administration in new war powers legislation."}
