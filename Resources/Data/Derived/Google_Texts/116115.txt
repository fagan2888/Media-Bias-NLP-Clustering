If anyone wants to tap into that usually hard to recreate way of French girl dressing, she should just look at Chloe's fall '14 collection, which of course was ironically created by a British woman, Clare Waight Keller. But that goes to show just how, after a few hits and misses, she's really gotten into a groove at the house.

It often takes a few seasons for a new designer to put her stamp on a brand and Clare Waight Keller has showed her strongest collection for the house yet. It works because it looks unmistakably Chloe (the distinctly French prettiness) and yet contemporary and unique (the unaffected cool factor and the absence of too many sartorial bells and whistles, to name a few.) Even when she's working with ubiquitous trends, such as fall's inescapable shaggy surfaces and trimmings, she does it in a unique and memorable way such as in a series of black, easy and lithe dresses with gold hardware.
