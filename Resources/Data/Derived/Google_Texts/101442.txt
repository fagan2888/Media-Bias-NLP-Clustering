Hardwell's known as the World's No. 1 DJ - as declared by DJ Mag's annual poll last year - but who is the guy behind the beats?

The EDM star born Robbert van de Corput--and his fellow Dutch DJs Dyro and Dannic, on Hardwell's Revealed Recordings label--sat down for a 10 for Tap video interview ahead of their sold-out show at the Rave's Eagles Ballroom April 11.

Check out the video below to find out more about Hardwell's new "I Am Hardwell" documentary, his forthcoming album, who he thinks is the world's No. 1 DJ is, and who among the guys is the best "Call of Duty" player. And when the conversation turns to dancing, see one of the guys show off his best twerking moves, inches from Hardwell's face. (No doubt Hardwell loved that.)
