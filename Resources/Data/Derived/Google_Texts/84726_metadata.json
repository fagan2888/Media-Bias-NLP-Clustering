The coins are then mailed to you, the company explains, so you can have them handy for doing laundry.\n\nRelated: Mark Cuban on How Obamacare Could Help Startups\n\nSure, bank branches are closing, people are lazy and getting a steady supply of quarters in the mail every month may seem more convenient to some, but the startup doesn\u2019t look to have huge growth ahead: It has about 20 customers and isn\u2019t looking for any VC funding. Plus, most American homes have washing machines.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll admit it, it\u2019s a little bit of a negative critique for the most part on Twitter, which is good,\u201d Caleb Brown, a cofounder, told Gawker\u2019s Valleywag.\n\nThat kind of response won\u2019t survive the media spin cycle.\n\nIf Washboard isn\u2019t the next Google, the co-founders, two software developers who first came up with the idea separately a year ago, haven\u2019t wasted time. They launched the site Thursday morning and are already profitable.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t put a dime in the business,\u201d Brown, who is based in Pittsburgh, Penn., told The Fiscal Times, adding that the biggest investment has been his time. \u201cWe created Washboard so people wouldn\u2019t have to go to the bank, but I\u2019m going to the bank every day. That\u2019s all I do.\u201d\n\nBrown noted that their profit margin is roughly 20 percent and their biggest expense is shipping, since quarters are heavy.\n\n\u201cI knew this would be a bit silly, yet there\u2019s a market for it,\u201d he added. \u201cThis isn\u2019t necessarily my greatest achievement in life, but it makes sense.\u201d\n\nIn other absurd startup news, Yo, an app that does nothing but let you send the word yo to people, also launched this week. Who says innovation in America is dead?\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "If it isn\u2019t a joke, Washboard is one of the sillies", "title": "A Startup Called Washboard Promises $10 in Quarters for $15.
