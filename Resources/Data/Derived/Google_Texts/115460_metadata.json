I mean, everything I say he agrees with me, no matter what I say,\u201d Trump began. \u201cBut with the ethanol, really, he\u2019s got to come a long way.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cIf Ted Cruz is against ethanol, how does he win in Iowa? Because that\u2019s very anti-Iowa.\u201d\n\nTrump also appeared to take a veiled shot at Cruz\u2019s family background, suggesting Cruz might have trouble appealing to the state\u2019s evangelical voters. \u201cI do like Ted Cruz, but not a lot of evangelicals come out of Cuba,\u201d he said of the country where Cruz\u2019s father, an evangelical preacher, was born.\n\nThe attacks came after The New York Times reported that Cruz had questioned Trump\u2019s judgment at a closed-door fundraiser, straining the detente between two of the race\u2019s most outspoken candidates.\n\nTrump has gone after his other opponents gleefully and viciously, panning Jeb Bush as low-energy, Ben Carson as \u201cpathological\u201d and Marco Rubio as a lightweight who drinks too much water.\n\nBut the billionaire businessman had refrained from attacked Cruz, even as the Texas senator has surged in opinion polls, becoming Trump\u2019s most serious challenger in early-voting Iowa.\n\nTrump previewed his attack lines on Twitter on Friday morning. Cruz \u201cshould not make statements behind closed doors to his bosses, he should bring them out into the open \u2013 more fun that way!\u201d he wrote.\n\nTrump predicted Cruz would \u201cfall like all others. Will be easy!\u201d\n\nIn the audio leaked to the Times, Cruz said his approach has been to \u201cbear hug\u201d Trump. But he appeared less than eager to engage on Friday.\n\n\u201cThe Establishment\u2019s only hope: Trump & me in a cage match,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cSorry to disappoint \u2013 @realDonaldTrump is terrific. #DealWithIt\u201d\n\nCruz\u2019s campaign spokeswoman, Catherine Frazier, declined to comment on Trump\u2019s attacks.\n\nSeveral attendees at Trump\u2019s town hall event said in interviews before he spoke that they were torn between supporting Trump and Cruz, underscoring the risks each man faces going after the other too strongly.\n\nIndeed, Trump was relatively reserved in his criticism, repeatedly telling the crowd he liked Cruz.\n\nAsked at one point whether he would consider selecting Cruz as his running mate or nominating him to the supreme court, Trump was receptive.\n\n\u201cI would say that we would certainly have things in mind for Ted,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump took a new approach at the event at the Iowa State Fairgrounds, standing on a riser in the center of supporters, and speaking without a lectern.\n\nDuring his remarks, Trump stressed the importance of winning the state.\n\n\u201cIf we win Iowa,\u201d he said, \u201cI think we\u2019re going to win everything after that.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has finally unleashed a verbal assault on the one rival he has so far spared.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has finally unleashed a verbal assault on the one rival he has so far spared.", "title": "Will Cruz Be Trump's VP or Supreme Court Pick?
