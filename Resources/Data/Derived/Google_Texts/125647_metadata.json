She had just enough time to tell her children to get out and she got out as well. The house was already heavily involved in fire when our units arrived on scene,\u201d Palmeri said.\n\nThe two-story home, a rented wooden structure at 192 Alfred Road, appears to be a total loss, he said. According to tax records, the home was built in 1860.\n\n\u201cThere was quite a significant amount of fire damage to the home,\u201d Palmeri said. \u201cThey pretty much lost everything.\u201d\n\nThe cause of the fire has not been officially determined, Palmeri said, adding the state fire marshal has been called to investigate. He said the occupant reported that she was \u201cdrying articles at the time the fire started.\u201d It was also indicated in emergency communications that the fire is believed to have started in a dryer, where a sleeping bag was being dried.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly something we\u2019re going to look at,\u201d Palmeri said.\n\nCarmine Dolce, a Kennebunk resident who was heading home Monday morning, called 911 when he saw smoke coming from a window of the home. Within minutes, he said \u201ca blaze erupted.\u201d \u201cImmediately, everything started to crumble,\u201d he said. \u201cThat house went up in a blaze in five minutes. I\u2019ve never seen a fire move so quick.\u201d\n\nThe displaced family is currently staying with a friend, Palmeri said, and residents are already coordinating on social media sites to help meet their needs.\n\n\u201cWe did make efforts to try to save as much clothing as we could so that they have something,\u201d Palmeri said. \u201cThe majority of it is smoke damaged, but at least then they\u2019ll have something to wear.\u201d\n\nFire departments from Kennebunkport, Arundel, Biddeford, Wells, Arundel and Goodwin Mills provided mutual aid. Palmeri said a Wells firefighter was transported to Maine Medical Center, though he did not know the reason for the transport or the extent of the injuries.\n\n\u201cIt was a big response, but when we have fires of that magnitude, manpower is essential and the only way to get the manpower necessary is to call our neighbors,\u201d Palmeri said. \u201cWe have good mutual aid agreements in place for such emergencies.\u201d Traffic was rerouted in the area as crews battled the blaze. The fire was knocked down just after 11 a.m., and crews left the scene a few hours later.\n\nThis is the second damaging fire in Kennebunk in recent weeks. In late August, a fire that originated in a clothes dryer damaged an Intervale Road home and shuttered a daycare center that operated out of the home.\n\nThe most common cause of dryer fires is lint build up, Palmeri said. He urged residents to make sure their lint traps are kept clean. In addition, he cautioned people to pay attention to what should be put into a dryer.\n\n\u201cSome things are marked specifically because high heat will cause them to melt and burn,\u201d he said. \u201cBe careful what you try to dry and keep your lint traps clean.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "KENNEBUNK, Maine \u2014 A fire destroyed an Alfred Road home Monday morning, killing two pets and sending one firefighter to the hospital.
