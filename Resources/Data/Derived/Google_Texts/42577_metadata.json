It's a cruel thing to do,\" McGovern said.Debate over Planned Parenthood exploded last year, when anti-abortion activists released secretly-recorded videos showing the organisation's officials discussing use of aborted fetal tissue for medical research.Conservative critics, many of whom seek to outlaw abortion in the United States, have accused the organisation of selling fetal organs and body parts for profit, and encouraging women to have abortions in order to expand such operations.Seeking to douse the months-long scandal, Planned Parenthood announced in October that it will no longer accept reimbursements for costs of the donations.House Republican Ann Wagner called the vote \"a victory for women's health.\"", "article_metadata": {"rating": "General", "description": "Business Standard, India's leading destination for latest news, analysis and opinion on markets, companies, industry, economy, policy, banking and personal finance.", "Generator": "EditPlus", "author": "Business Standard", "robots": "index, follow, noodp, noydir", "msvalidate.01": "E0C7CB9C0E4737D8457C872C246D69E7", "keywords": "India business news, India company news, economy news, features, opinion, analysis, stock market, markets, commodities, derivatives, mutual fund, personal finance, management, marketing, investing, company financials, NSE, BSE, NCDEX, MCX, Nifty", "copyright": "www.business-standard.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\"As for the law putting a one-year moratorium on federal funding for Planned Parenthood, Democrats warned it would deny health care access to millions, particularly impoverished women.\n\"Democrats dismissed the vote as the 62nd attempt by Republicans to repeal, defund or otherwise dismantle the Affordable Care Act that narrowly passed a Democrat-led Congress in 2010.\n\"For the first time in five years, we will finally put a bill on the president's desk that defunds Obamacare,\" Ryan told reporters, noting that Democrats have been \"blocking and filibustering these bills\" for years.\n\"We are confronting the president with the hard, honest truth: Obamacare doesn't work,\" he added.Obama was seeking to talk about \"anything but his failures,\" but Republicans were \"not going to let him take a soft course,\" he said.\n\"I don't understand their obsession\" with repealing the health law, House Democrat Jim McGovern said, noting that doing so would \"throw 22 million people out of health insurance plans."}
