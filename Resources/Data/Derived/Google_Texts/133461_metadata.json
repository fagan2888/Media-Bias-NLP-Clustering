Sen. Ted Cruz, for his part, warned of a \u201cconstitutional crisis\u201d if Obama acts alone.\n\nBut how real is such a crisis?\n\nIf Congress\u2019 record of seeking to impeach or sue Obama is any indication, the crisis is simply nonexistent.\n\nThe president has taken executive action before. In June 2012, the Obama administration created a deportation relief program for young people called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA). No viable legal challenges ever came from that move.\n\nOne quasi-challenge does stand out. Kris Kobach, the Kansas secretary of state, once represented a group of Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers in a suit against the program, but the case was ultimately dismissed on procedural grounds. It was never appealed.\n\nKobach\u2019s lawsuit\u2014like his work behind Arizona\u2019s SB 1070 and other immigration laws across the United States\u2014was especially engineered to bring down DACA on constitutional and federal law grounds, under the guise that the program somehow forced law-abiding immigration officers to violate their oath to uphold the laws of the United States.\n\nA venerable argument, but it went nowhere in court.\n\nThis may explain why Boehner never bothered to sue Obama over DACA. Like his beleaguered lawsuit challenging the Obama administration over the implementation of the Affordable Care Act\u2014which he hasn\u2019t even filed\u2014a separate DACA lawsuit probably would\u2019ve failed big time in court.\n\nIt would\u2019ve failed because courts do not like to entertain political questions. Political questions are those involving the elected branches\u2014Congress and the president. And DACA, a program involving Obama\u2019s broad discretion in enforcing immigration laws, has everything to do with Obama\u2019s powers as the nation\u2019s top executive. But DACA is also related to Congress\u2019 powers to pass immigration laws.\n\nSo who\u2019s right and who\u2019s wrong? That\u2019s a dispute a federal judge would likely never settle, because a judge\u2019s only task is to say what the law is\u2014not to referee a power dispute between co-equal branches of government. That\u2019s how separation of powers works.\n\nAnd that\u2019s precisely why Obama\u2019s plan to use executive action on immigration\u2014within the parameters of existing immigration law\u2014poses no constitutional problems. So long as he acts in a manner consistent with his prosecutorial discretion to enforce or not enforce the laws, the courts won\u2019t get involved.\n\nCould the president unilaterally grant deportation relief to all undocumented immigrants and start issuing green cards? No, that would overstep his executive authority. But he\u2019s empowered to use the country\u2019s resources in the best way possible, which includes allowing people who aren\u2019t a threat to stay in the country.\n\nCristian A.
