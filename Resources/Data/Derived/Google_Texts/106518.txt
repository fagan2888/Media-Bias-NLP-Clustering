A 23-year-old Wesley Chapel man turned himself in to troopers at the Pasco County Jail this afternoon, after leaving the scene of an early morning crash that injured two teenagers, the Florida Highway Patrol said.

Matthew John West was driving north on Sunlake Drive in Lutz, north of County Line Road, at about 12:31 a.m. when his Chevrolet Blazer collided with a Nissan SUV that was parked at a dead end facing north, troopers said. The impact caused both vehicles to turn over on their sides.

The driver of the Nissan SUV, Frank Victor Vasquez, 17, of Lutz, and his passenger, Kaylee Elizabeth Baer, 16, of Lutz, were both taken to St. Joe’s Hospital. Vasquez’s injuries were described as critical. Baer was listed in serious condition.

West fled the scene on foot following the crash, but turned himself in at 2:30 p.m., identifying himself as the driver involved in the crash, troopers said.

At this time, no charges have been filed against West, troopers said.
