For those who do not remember, former Texas state Senator Wendy Davis lost her bid against Governor Greg Abbott by more than 20 percentage points. But Davis\u2019s real claim to fame was proudly defending late-term abortion by standing for hours during a state Congressional filibuster. Weeks after Davis endorsed Clinton, the 2016 Democrat presidential candidate\n\ndecided to fly her to Iowa so Davis can campaign on Clinton\u2019s behalf.\n\nIn her first act as a Hillary pundit, Davis poked at Carly Fiorina over her opposition to Planned Parenthood\u2019s baby parts operation after they were exposed by the Center for Medical Progress in a series of undercover videos. \u201cI think she\u2019s part of the problem,\u201d Davis told KXAN, \u201cAnd she has demonstrated that she too is going to take a position that\u2019s contrary to that many people in this country\u2026\u201d she said.\n\nEven though Hillary Clinton claims to be an advocate for children, she is a long-time advocate of abortion, even late-term abortion. She recently supported Planned Parenthood when gruesome videos released by CMP showed their top level staffers negotiating the price of baby parts. In 2009, Hillary Clinton praised the founder of Planned Parenthood. Margaret Sanger was known for her eugenic beliefs which targeted the poor community with sterilization. She also addressed the Klu Klux Klan.\n\nOn her campaign website under \u201cissues,\u201d Hillary reiterates her support of Planned Parenthood and abortion:\n\nHillary will stand up to Republican attempts to defund Planned Parenthood, which would restrict access to critical health care services, like cancer screenings, contraception, and safe, legal abortion. She will fight to protect the Affordable Care Act, which bans insurance companies from discriminating against women and guarantees 47 million women and counting access to preventive care.\u201d\n\nDavis has also been a defender of abortion, having had one herself. During her failed gubernatorial campaign in Texas, Davis received funding from Planned Parenthood, NARAL, and the abortion lobby. Davis recently admitted to aborting her own daughter after 20 weeks because of a \u201cbrain deformation,\u201d calling her abortion an act of \u201clove.\u201d\n\nA message linking Wendy Davis\u2019s abortion stand to Hillary\u2019s posted to the \u201cWomen for Hillary Organizing Event\u201d says the campaign is \u201cso excited to have Wendy Davis.\u201d According to the Clinton campaign, Davis will travel to several venues in Iowa raging from Des Moines to Cedar Falls, Dec. 17-18, to talk about \u201cClinton\u2019s commitment to protecting women\u2019s access to health care and defending Planned Parenthood from Republican\u2019s attacks\u201d \u2013 code for abortion on demand for any reason at any time.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Davis' real claim to fame was proudly defending late-term abortion by standing for hours during a state Congressional filibuster.", "og": {"site_name": "Live Action News", "description": "Davis' real claim to fame was proudly defending late-term abortion by standing for hours during a state Congressional filibuster.", "title": "Abortion advocate Wendy Davis to stump for Hillary Clinton in Iowa", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 929, "identifier": "http://liveactionnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Hillary-CLinton-and-Wendy-Davis.jpg", "height": 401}, "updated_time": "2015-12-15T14:00:45-04:00", "url": "http://liveactionnews.org/abortion-advocate-wendy-davis-stump-hillary-clinton-iowa/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Davis' real claim to fame was proudly defending late-term abortion by standing for hours during a state Congressional filibuster.", "title": "Abortion advocate Wendy Davis to stump for Hillary Clinton in Iowa | Live Action News", "image": "http://liveactionnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Hillary-CLinton-and-Wendy-Davis.jpg", "creator": "@Saynsumthn", "site": "@liveactionnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "framework": "Alkivia Framework 0.8", "fb": {"admins": 159900244, "pages": 49651563727}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/liveactionnewsonline", "section": "Politics", "tag": "Wendy Davis", "published_time": "2015-12-14T21:03:49-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-15T14:00:45-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "The Hillary Clinton campaign has announced that ardent late-term abortion advocate Wendy Davis will stump on Hillary\u2019s behalf in the state of Iowa.\nEven though Hillary Clinton claims to be an advocate for children, she is a long-time advocate of abortion, even late-term abortion.\nWeeks after Davis endorsed Clinton, the 2016 Democrat presidential candidatedecided to fly her to Iowa so Davis can campaign on Clinton\u2019s behalf.\nFor those who do not remember, former Texas state Senator Wendy Davis lost her bid against Governor Greg Abbott by more than 20 percentage points.\nIn 2009, Hillary Clinton praised the founder of Planned Parenthood."}
