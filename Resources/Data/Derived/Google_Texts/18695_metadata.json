Michael Grimm (R), who pleaded guilty to tax evasion in December, Daniel Donovan (R) won 60 percent of the vote, beating opponent Vincent Gentile (D) by a large margin. But Donovan, who\u2019s served as a district attorney for more than 10 years was relatively unknown before rising to fame as the prosecutor who monitored the grand jury that convened in response to Garner\u2019s death.\n\nAfter calling for a grand jury of 23 people to review Officer Daniel Pantaleo\u2019s fatal chokehold of the unarmed black man, which was caught on video, Donovan defended the non-indictment. \u201cNo one likes to serve on juries, but they upheld their civic duty and they sat for nine weeks, and they\u2019re the only people that heard all the evidence, and they\u2019re the only people that deliberated,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we should respect their decision.\u201d In response to criticism that he was behind the non-indictment and refused to unseal grand jury records Donovan rebutted, \u201cPeople thought I presented the case. I never set foot in the grand jury chamber. There are people who thought I met with witnesses. I did not meet with witnesses.\u201d Before the grand jury convened, Donovan\u2019s office investigated the circumstances of Garner\u2019s death for four months, compiling civilian witness testimony and testimony from medical and forensic experts to present to the 23 jurors.\n\nMany believed video of the fatal encounter was sure to lead to an indictment, even though charges are rarely brought against officers. And legal experts were outraged by the decision. \u201cThe grand jury is a tool of the prosecutor. At a minimum, it was negligent, it was reckless, it was some level of homicide,\u201d said one law school professor. \u201cSurely they could have indicted this officer on any number of charges and let the public hear, let a trial happen, expose to the light of day what went on here.\u201d\n\nLuckily for Donovan, people in his congressional district largely agreed with his role in the proceedings. A poll of likely Staten Island voters found that 50 percent of respondents viewed the grand jury\u2019s decision favorably, compared to a Quinnipiac University poll of New York City voters, which concluded that 68 percent of respondents agreed there was \u201cno excuse\u201d for how police acted during the encounter with Garner. Ironically, Donovan tried to distance himself from the case throughout his campaign, but his position may have swung votes in his favor, since the majority of Staten Island voters are white Republicans who overwhelmingly support police officers.\n\nDonovan has since aligned himself with the city\u2019 police force, which earned him endorsements from two major police unions: the Captains Endowment Association and Lieutenants Benevolent Association. On his campaign page, Donovan pledged to support fair and competitive wages for officers, and to oppose departmental cuts. He also doubled down against the push to decriminalize minor offenses, such as public urination, consumption of alcohol in public, and littering. \u201cI fail to see why anyone, particularly elected officials, would want to subject the public to a return of the dark, dismal, crime-ridden days of 20-plus years ago,\u201d he said of council members\u2019 push for reform.\n\nOutside of the criminal justice system, Donovan\u2019s stance on policy issues aligns with fellow conservatives \u2014 the majority of Staten Island\u2019s population. Although he applauded certain aspects of Obamacare, including the provision that allows individuals to stay on their parents\u2019 plans until they turn 26, in March, he did an about-face in April, saying Obamacare should be repealed in its entirety. He opposes abortion and raising the federal minimum wage if businesses aren\u2019t given incentives or assistance to pay workers more. He supports tax cuts and has openly criticized President Obama\u2019s foreign policy, saying the President hasn\u2019t done enough to defend Israel. On immigration, however, Donovan has assumed a more lenient stance, arguing people should only be deported if they \u201ccommit heinous crimes.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "And he won by a large margin.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "And he won by a large margin.", "title": "Man Fails To Prosecute Officer Caught On Tape Killing Unarmed Man, Gets Elected To Congress", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2015/05/06/3655037/guy-failed-prosecute-eric-garners-killer-just-became-congressman/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/AP426347861866.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "And he won by a large margin.", "creator": "@CarimahWheat", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/AP426347861866-321x214.jpg", "title": "Man Fails To Prosecute Officer Caught On Tape Killing Unarmed Man, Gets Elected To Congress", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-justice", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/AP426347861866.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/AP426347861866.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-06T08:00:37+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/carimahwritesstuff/"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8fb2\"", "article_summary": "I never set foot in the grand jury chamber.\nAfter calling for a grand jury of 23 people to review Officer Daniel Pantaleo\u2019s fatal chokehold of the unarmed black man, which was caught on video, Donovan defended the non-indictment.\n\u201cThe grand jury is a tool of the prosecutor.\n\u201cI think we should respect their decision.\u201d In response to criticism that he was behind the non-indictment and refused to unseal grand jury records Donovan rebutted, \u201cPeople thought I presented the case.\nHe opposes abortion and raising the federal minimum wage if businesses aren\u2019t given incentives or assistance to pay workers more."}
