The funds are divided into separate projects: $138 million to improve outpatient facilities; $226 million to construct a behavioral health hospital; and $571 million to replace the Maricopa Medical Center, which includes the trauma center and Arizona Burn Center.\n\nKevin McCarthy, president of Arizona Tax Research Association President and committee chairman for No on Prop 480, said the bond forces taxpayers to fund duplicate health care systems. He called MIHS \u201ca throwback to a bygone era,\u201d and he said increased funding would thrust an unnecessary burden on county taxpayers.\n\nThe dominant system in place is the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System (AHCCCS), Arizona\u2019s version of Medicaid. McCarthy said AHCCCS relieved county hospitals of the burden of caring for the poor when it was first implemented.\n\n\u201cThere was a time in our history prior to the creation of AHCCCS where the counties were the payer of last resort, where county governments \u2014 much to their chagrin \u2014 were responsible for paying for the health care of the poor,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said most of the counties quickly closed their hospitals after AHCCCS, with Maricopa being an exception.\n\n\u201cSo one of the many questions is to what extent should Maricopa County taxpayers continue to duplicate funding for low-income health care that they\u2019re already paying for in federal taxes and state taxes?\u201d McCarthy said.\n\nBut proponents of Prop. 480 say state and federal programs like AHCCCS and the Affordable Care Act are insufficient. The problem is that not all members of the indigent population are insured by those programs.\n\nMaricopa Health Foundation president Tom McKinley said MIHS provided $150 million in uncompensated care last year. That number does not include AHCCCS patients, whom private hospitals are required to serve.\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act will never solve poverty,\u201d he said.\n\nTerence McMahon, chairman of the Maricopa County Special Health Care District, said the county hospital serves the uninsured while the private hospitals don\u2019t.\n\n\u201cI know they have said, \u2018Oh, we\u2019ll take up the slack,\u2019 but they haven\u2019t done so in the past and there\u2019s no reason to believe that they will in the future,\u201d he said.\n\nMcMahon and McKinley said the county hospital provides unique services private hospitals and AHCCCS cannot match. They emphasized the teaching center, which they said promotes education in a manner unparalleled by the private sector. McMahon said Maricopa trains approximately 5,500 health professionals every year.\n\n\u201cThe private side has no motivation,\u201d McKinley said.\n\nProp. 480 proponents also emphasized special services of the MIHS Maricopa Medical Center. It is one of the 10 trauma centers designated by the state as Level I and contains one of Arizona\u2019s two burn centers.\n\nMcCarthy, however, said the national popularity of those services means that Maricopa Medical Center should not be funded at the county level.\n\n\u201cIf this is a needed hospital \u2014 whether it\u2019s to perform as a burn unit or play a behavioral health role \u2014 and if this is an asset the taxpayers are responsible for, it\u2019s a state asset. It\u2019s not a county asset,\u201d he said. \u201cThey [taxpayers] will tell you quite probably that there are people from all over the state that use that hospital, people from all over the Southwest that use the burn unit.\u201d\n\nMcCarthy said what motivated him to join the opposition to Prop. 480 was the sheer cost of the bill.McCarthy and the Arizona Tax Research Association said the 27-year total will amount to $1.6 billion when interest is added.\n\n\u201cQuite frankly, we\u2019re just staggered by the amount of money that is being requested here and in lump sum,\u201d he said.\n\nBut McMahon said McCarthy was blowing the bond cost out of proportion.\n\n\u201cWhen you multiply a 30-year tax, you get kind of a large number, but really the cost to the average homeowner in the county is probably going to be about $20 a year, which I would venture to say is not anywhere near a massive tax increase,\u201d McMahon said. The Yes on 480 committee says the property tax amounts to \u201c$13.74 yearly per $100,000 of assessed valuation.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you look at the cost of this for the individual taxpayer, it\u2019s a no-brainer,\u201d McKinley said.\n\nMcCarthy said it makes perfect sense to publicize the 27-year total, and he said Yes on 480\u2019s main tactic is to hide the true long-term cost of the proposal.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re characterizing this as a cost of a cup of coffee,\u201d he said.\n\nMcCarthy said another telling strike against the proposal is its reception from the Arizona business community. He cited major Valley hospital organizations \u2014 Dignity Health, Banner Medical, Tenet and Scottsdale Lincoln \u2014 that have not voiced support for Prop. 480.\n\n\u201cThey failed to secure the support of any business organization that is of any note on a countywide basis,\u201d he said.\n\nMcMahon said although the proposal wasn\u2019t getting verbal support, at least it wasn\u2019t getting much dissent. He said the private hospitals haven\u2019t campaigned against it.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve said they have some questions about how the money would be spent, but they haven\u2019t come out, as far as I\u2019m aware, and said, \u2018No, we\u2019re absolutely opposed to this,\u201d he said.\n\nHospital executives expressed concerns about the bond request to the Arizona Republic editorial board, but none of them officially oppose it. Banner Public Relations Specialist Sue Breding said the company is not commenting on the proposition.\n\nMcMahon said he was pleased the Arizona Chamber of Commerce hasn\u2019t chosen a side. The only chamber of commerce to speak out has been the Gilbert Chamber of Commerce, which announced its opposition on Prop. 480 Oct. 1. A statement from the chamber said it needs \u201ca more clearly defined itemization for use of funds.\u201d\n\n\u201cWithout a specific outline for use of this bond, voters are not given the opportunity to prioritize the services provided and facilities at which the money will be spent,\u201d Chamber CEO Kathy Tilque said in the statement\n\n\u2022 James Anderson is a junior at ASU\u2019s Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication.
