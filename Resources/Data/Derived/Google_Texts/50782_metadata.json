Lisa Wilson of Victorville, Calif., was no different \u2014 or at least she was until her father was diagnosed with a rare cancer.\n\nWilson, of course, wanted her father to witness the ceremony, so she rearranged her wedding plans to get married in the University of California, Irvine Medical Center in Orange, Calif., where her father was a patient. More importantly, Wilson wanted to share that traditional father-daughter dance.\n\n\u201cI asked him, \u2018I said daddy I want to do my father-daughter dance with you,\u2019\u201d Wilson told CBS. \u201cHe said, \u2018I can\u2019t dance and I said you don\u2019t have to. I want to dance with your hands.\u2019\u201d\n\nHolding her father\u2019s hands, Wilson swayed along to Whitney Houston\u2019s \u201cI Will Always Love You.\u201d Not long after the two were able to share this special moment, Wilson\u2019s father died.\n\nWhile Wilson was able to get her father to dance, Robert Pantoja, her now-husband, was able to receive some words of wisdom. \u201cHe looked at me, he goes \u2018Rob, you\u2019re the lucky one. You won the lottery, you got my baby girl,'\u201d Pantoja told CBS.\n\nWatch the sweet moment in the video below, but not before you grab some tissues.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "daughter, gives, dying, father, final, dance, after, getting, married, icu", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Lisa Wilson made sure to dance with her father at her wedding before he died.", "title": "This Woman Got Married In The ICU For Her Dying Father [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/daughter-gives-dying-father-final-dance-after-getting-married-icu-302022", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/09/daughter-holding-fathers-hands.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Lisa Wilson made sure to dance with her father at her wedding before he died.", "title": "This Woman Got Married In The ICU For Her Dying Father [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/daughter-gives-dying-father-final-dance-after-getting-married-icu-302022", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/09/daughter-holding-fathers-hands.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/09/daughter-holding-fathers-hands.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-09-09T11:03:09-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-09T11:03:08-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Lisa Wilson made sure to dance with her father at her wedding before he died."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd6bd\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI asked him, \u2018I said daddy I want to do my father-daughter dance with you,\u2019\u201d Wilson told CBS.\nYou won the lottery, you got my baby girl,'\u201d Pantoja told CBS.\nWhile Wilson was able to get her father to dance, Robert Pantoja, her now-husband, was able to receive some words of wisdom.\nMost girls grow up with a vision of the wedding they\u2019ll one day have, from the venue to the dress they\u2019ll wear and the types of flowers they\u2019ll have arranged into centerpieces.\nLisa Wilson made sure to dance with her father at her wedding before he died."}
