With more people insured today, less charity care is needed.\"\n\nHere are six other findings from the analysis.\n\n1. From September 2014 to September 2015, inpatient admissions increased 3.6 percent for nonexpansion states and decreased 1.4 percent for expansion states.\n\n2. In Medicaid nonexpansion states, commercial/managed care payer mix increased approximately one percentage point while Medicaid expansion states saw a slight decline.\n\n3. Outpatient volume from September 2014 to September 2015 dropped 2.8 percent for expansion states and 4.3 percent for nonexpansion states.\n\n4. Average outpatient net revenue per case increased in Medicaid nonexpansion states by 4.1 percent from September 2014 to September 2015 while expansion states increased slightly, up 1.1 percent over the same period the year prior.\n\n5. Compared with September 2014, average inpatient net revenue per case in Medicaid expansion states increased 2.7 percent while nonexpansion states remained flat.\n\n6. In the analysis, the difference between Medicaid expansion states and nonexpansion states is largely attributed to high volume and low net revenue laboratory services delivered at a handful of hospitals in expansion states.\n\nMore articles on healthcare finance:\n\nTurnarounds for OhioHealth hospitals on track: 3 things to know\n\n7 things to know about UMass Memorial's financial turnaround\n\nFor-profit hospital stock report: Nov. 9-13\n\n\u00a9 Copyright ASC COMMUNICATIONS 2016.
