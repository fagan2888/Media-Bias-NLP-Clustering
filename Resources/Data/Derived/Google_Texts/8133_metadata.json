He says that\u2019s not what customers get in the store.\n\n\u201cIt contains 38, 37, 29, or 26 ounces, depending on what flavor you get,\u201d Morris said.\n\nA representative of the store chain said Morris\u2019 is the only complaint they\u2019ve ever received about ice cream ads. The rep claims Morris doesn\u2019t understand the difference between a fluid ounce and a dry ounce.\n\n\u201cWe are, and have been in compliance with the law, in terms of advertising, labels and weights and measures,\u201d said Fry\u2019s Food Stores Vice President Kyle McKay.\n\nMorris said that he is looking forward to his day in court. He says it comes down to making sure the customers get what they pay for. His action is a small claim, so there are no attorneys and he\u2019s limited to asking for $2,500 for court costs and reimbursement for his ice cream purchases.\n\n\u201cYou buy 100 percent, pay for 100 percent and you get 60 percent,\u201d said Morris. \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "An Arizona man claims customers who buy ice cream from a nationally-known grocery chain are getting ripped off.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=339570924", "og": {"site_name": "WQAD.com", "description": "An Arizona man claims customers who buy ice cream from a nationally-known grocery chain are getting ripped off.", "title": "Grocery chain sued for alleged misleading ice cream ads", "url": "http://wqad.com/2014/01/25/grocery-chain-sued-for-alleged-misleading-ice-cream-ads/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "https://localtvwqad.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/s030338468.jpg", "height": 360}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://localtvwqad.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/s030338468.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@mytwitterhandle", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@mytwitterhandle"}, "keywords": "moneysaver, ice cream lawsuit", "p": {"domain_verify": "93c0125b6e5dd793b0f306c174977ff3"}, "fb": {"pages": 32869603490}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "application-name": "WQAD.com", "google-site-verification": "oCyrEMhIYdAYe44exrSiY6lwtVx417KNhwh2t4d9nwM", "msvalidate.01": "9CC50DB4C5614EA88B5CFA75E33AAB02", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/wqad8", "published_time": "2014-01-25T15:26:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-25T15:26:24+00:00", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/wqad8"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wqad.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2882036417f6cd8ccaa6f6a7d2c6eaae?s=16"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9a29\"", "article_summary": "\u00d7 Grocery chain sued for alleged misleading ice cream adsAn Arizona man claims customers who buy ice cream from a nationally-known grocery chain are getting ripped off.\nThe lawsuit claims that the food chain has been misleading customers by posting deceptive ice cream ads according to KPHO.\nA representative of the store chain said Morris\u2019 is the only complaint they\u2019ve ever received about ice cream ads.\nMorris says he has saved more than a dozen newspaper circulars that advertise 48-ounce containers of ice cream.\nGerald Morris, 71, of Tucson, recently filed a lawsuit in small claims court against Fry\u2019s Food Stores and its parent company, Kroger."}
