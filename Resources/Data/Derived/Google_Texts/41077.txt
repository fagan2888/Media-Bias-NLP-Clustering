GRANTS, N.M. (AP) - A New Mexico man who had been watching TV’s “The Walking Dead” says he fatally beat his friend before he could become a zombie.

Grants police spokesman Moses Marquez said Sunday that 23-year-old Christopher Paquin was beaten and that 23-year-old Damon Perry is being held on a murder charge.

Officers were called Thursday afternoon to an apartment complex where Perry was allegedly wielding a knife.

They found Paquin’s body inside an apartment and maintenance workers detaining Perry.

Perry told investigators they had been drinking when Paquin began “to change into a zombie” and tried to bite him.

Police say Perry beat Paquin with his hands, feet, an electric guitar and a microwave.

Perry attributed his actions to binge-watching “The Walking Dead,” which centers on a zombie apocalypse, on Netflix.
