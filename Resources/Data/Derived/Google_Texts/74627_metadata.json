The occasion was a case involving a would-be judge in Florida, Lanell Williams-Yulee, who broke a rule against personally soliciting funds during her unsuccessful bid in 2009 to become a Hillsborough County Judge. For violating Canon 7C(1) of Florida\u2019s Code of Judicial Ethics, Ms Williams-Yulee was slapped with a rebuke and a $1,860.30 fine. She responded with a lawsuit complaining that the ethics rule intruded on her freedom of speech.\n\nThe majority opinion in Williams-Yulee v Florida Bar, issued on April 29th, opens by noting a distinction between judges and other elected officials: \u201cJudges are not politicians, even when they come to the bench by way of the ballot,\u201d Chief Justice Roberts writes. \"A State may assure its people that judges will apply the law without fear or favour\u2014and without having personally asked anyone for money.\u201d\n\nChief Justice Roberts's rollicking opinion calls on everything from the Magna Carta (\u201c[t]o no one will we sell, to no one will we refuse or delay, right or justice\u201d) to the Girl Scouts: refusing personal solicitations for funds can be difficult, he explains, \u201cas anyone who has encountered a Girl Scout selling cookies outside a grocery store can attest\u201d. He argues that the Florida ethics rule passes \u201cstrict scrutiny,\u201d the test the court employs when fundamental rights, such as free speech, are at stake. Avoiding the perception of impropriety in the administration of justice is a compelling state goal, he writes, and banning personal solicitation by judicial candidates is a narrowly tailored strategy for advancing it. When judges \u201cpersonally ask for money\", their integrity may be diminished in the eyes of the public.\n\nThis sounds sensible, but the dissenters have a point when they complain that this version of strict scrutiny is rather weak tea. The four conservative justices penned three scathing dissents, including one from Justice Anthony Kennedy noting the \u201cirony\u201d that judicial candidates would have their own First Amendment rights curtailed before they even took the bench to protect those rights for others. Justice Antonin Scalia writes that the majority salvaged the ethics rule only through \u201csleight of hand\u201d and \u201ctwistifications.\u201d Justice Samuel Alito calls the rule \u201cabout as narrowly tailored as a burlap bag.\u201d Such rancour directed at the chief from the pens of Mr Roberts\u2019s usual allies is a rare sight.\n\nDespite the drama, the practical implications of the Williams-Yulee decision are frankly modest. Critics of the ballooning costs of campaigns have cheered the ruling (\u201cCampaign finance reformers just won a massive victory at the Supreme Court,\u201d declared Andrew Prokop\u2019s headline at Vox), but its effects will likely be narrow. The ethics rule leaves candidates for judgeships free, as Mr Roberts writes, to \u201ccontact potential supporters in person, on the phone, or online. They can promote their campaigns on radio, television, or other media.\u201d And judicial candidates can \u201cdirect their campaign committees\u201d to raise money on their behalf.\n\nThis reality check leaves Garrett Epps at the Atlantic musing that \u201cthere\u2019s less in this than meets the eye.\u201d Judges will continue to be elected in 39 states; judicial candidates will continue to (indirectly) raise money to finance their campaigns; and most campaign regulations for non-judicial candidates for public office will remain verboten. In the majority opinion, the chief justice smirked that \"a reader of Justice Kennedy's dissent could be forgiven for concluding that the Court has just upheld a latter-day version of the Alien and Sedition Acts, approving \u2018state censorship\u2019 that \u2018locks the First Amendment out,\u2019 imposes a \u2018gag\u2019 on candidates, and inflicts \u2018dead weight\u2019 on a \u2018silenced\u2019 public debate.\u201d\n\nFor Justice Kennedy, any curb on soliciting funds violates the First Amendment and calls for a jeremiad. In his dissent, Justice Kennedy wrenches out of context a famous line written by Justice Louis Brandeis in Whitney v California, a case from 1925 involving the arrest of a communist party member for advocating terrorism. In Whitney, Justice Brandeis voted to uphold Charlotte Anita Whitney's conviction on the grounds that she was involved in a \"conspiracy\" to commit \"serious crimes.\" But he wrote that absent actual criminal plans, \"assembling with a political party\" to discuss dangerous ideas enjoys the protection of the First Amendment. The \u201cremedy\u201d to \u201cfalsehood and fallacies\u201d in public discussion is not \u201cenforced silence,\" Justice Brandeis insisted, but \"more speech.\" For Justice Kennedy a ban on personal solicitation by judicial candidates is essentially enforcing silence.\n\nBut it is hard to imagine how \"more speech\" would improve judicial elections. Mr Kennedy suggests appointing \"a panel charged with periodic evaluation of campaign statements, candor, and fairness,\" which is, by itself, unobjectionable. But while such a panel may help promote \"principled, decent, and thoughtful discourse\", it cannot break the appearance of quid-pro-quo contributions requested by judicial candidates. Justice Brandeis' oft-quoted \"more speech\" line thus has nothing to do with Ms Williams-Yulee\u2019s complaint. The Florida ethics rule was not written to prevent untrue, biased or dangerous ideas from flooding the intellectual marketplace. It was designed to build public confidence in the courts as impartial tribunals where judges dole out justice, not favours. As it happens, Florida rules were written in response to a number of outrageous corruption scandals in the 1970s which forced four justices of the state\u2019s highest court to resign. As an amicus brief from the American Bar Association explains, \u201c[s]everal justices attempted to fix cases on behalf of campaign supporters. Another justice resigned after he was filmed on a gambling junket to Las Vegas paid for by a dog track that had a case pending before the high court, while others allowed themselves to be lobbied by a lawyer representing the public utilities industry in a case with major implications to the rate-paying public and even permitted him to ghostwrite the opinion for the Florida Supreme Court.\u201d The Florida Bar had good reason to put up roadblocks between the quid of a campaign donation and the quo of a favourable hearing from a judge whose election was funded by a party to a case.\n\nKeeping the judiciary fair in the eyes of the public is a priority for Chief Justice Roberts. During his confirmation hearings in 2005, he famously compared a judge's job to that of a baseball umpire who calls \"balls and strikes\" without bias or favouritism. And in the 2012 case challenging the Affordable Care Act, the chief avoided a 5-4 ruling along ideological lines to bring down Barack Obama's signature legislative achievement by crossing over to the liberal side. As he weighs how to vote in this term's most hyped cases\u2014same-sex marriage and another challenge to the ACA, both of which will have a profound and long-lasting impact on millions of Americans' lives\u2014Chief Justice Roberts is clearly considering the legacy of his court. The majority opinion in Williams-Yulee is, more than anything else, a sign of his fervent desire to cultivate the appearance of impartiality in America's judiciary, including and especially its highest court.\n\nDig deeper:\n\nThe trouble with electing judges (August 2014)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/50_by_50/images/2015/05/blogs/democracy-america/20150509_usp503.jpg", "sailthru.flytitle": "Free speech and judges", "description": "A case over campaign contributions for elected judges divides the court", "pubdate": 20150505, "og": {"site_name": "The Economist", "description": "A case over campaign contributions for elected judges divides the court", "title": "Keeping up appearances", "url": "http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2015/05/free-speech-and-judges", "image": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2015/05/blogs/democracy-america/20150509_usp503.jpg", "type": "article"}, "sailthru.rubric": "A case over campaign contributions for elected judges divides the court", "sailthru.date": "2015-05-05 18:29:42", "twitter": {"image": "https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2015/05/blogs/democracy-america/20150509_usp503.jpg", "site": "@TheEconomist", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@EconUS"}, "revisit-after": "1 day", "sailthru.web_section": "Blogs", "fb": {"pages": 6013004059, "app_id": 173277756049645}, "sailthru.imagepath": "images/2015/05/blogs/democracy-america/20150509_usp503.jpg", "articleid": 21650402, "sailthru.image.thumb_mfte": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/ec_related_article_image/images/2015/05/blogs/democracy-america/20150509_usp503.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "Free speech and judges", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theeconomist"}, "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2015/05/blogs/democracy-america/20150509_usp503.jpg", "news_keywords": "Free speech and judges"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2a04\"", "article_summary": "He argues that the Florida ethics rule passes \u201cstrict scrutiny,\u201d the test the court employs when fundamental rights, such as free speech, are at stake.\nShe responded with a lawsuit complaining that the ethics rule intruded on her freedom of speech.\nThe Florida ethics rule was not written to prevent untrue, biased or dangerous ideas from flooding the intellectual marketplace.\nFor violating Canon 7C(1) of Florida\u2019s Code of Judicial Ethics, Ms Williams-Yulee was slapped with a rebuke and a $1,860.30 fine.\nThe ethics rule leaves candidates for judgeships free, as Mr Roberts writes, to \u201ccontact potential supporters in person, on the phone, or online."}
