There are a lot of blemishes on the record of our current governor. Here are twenty reasons not to re-elect Terry Branstad-\n\n#20- Branstad\u2019s campaign pulled a dirty trick by creating a fake Jack Hatch website.\n\n#19- Branstad actually hosted the Family Research Council\u2019s \u201chate fest\u201d in Ames earlier this year.\n\n#18- At a Texas fundraiser Branstad admitted support for \u201ctort reform\u201d.\n\n#17- In an insult to the principle of the separation of church and state, Branstad was an active participant and signed a state declaration for Bob Vander Plaats\u2019s \u201cDay of Prayer and Fasting\u201d.\n\n#16- The renovations at the Iowa Veterans Home are mired in controversy.\n\n#15- Branstad\u2019s Administration gave up a $1 million solar grant.\n\n#14- His corporate tax cut will leave cities and counties short of funds.\n\n#13- The Orascom boondoggle.\n\n#12- With our roads and bridges falling apart, Branstad has shown zero leadership on raising the gas tax.\n\n#11- Branstad has cost the taxpayers over $500,000 in legal fees in trying to unfairly get rid of Christopher Godfrey.\n\n#10- Branstad illegally closed the Iowa Juvenile Home in Toledo.\n\n#9- Branstad illegally closed 36 unemployment offices at the height of the Great Recession.\n\n#8- Iowa\u2019s water pollution and soil erosion are still a huge problem.\n\n#7- Branstad\u2019s Administration took the Chief Administative Law Judge\u2019s position and made it susceptible to political pressure from the Governor\u2019s office.\n\n#6- Branstad still has close ties to the American Legislative Exchange Council.\n\n#5- Branstad has failed to cut the cost of state government. According to a study reported in the 8/31/14 Des Moines Register, state spending has gone up 17.5%.\n\n#4- Another one of Branstad\u2019s big goals was to create 200,000 jobs. So far the net number of jobs created since 2011 is around 74,000.\n\n#3- Another big Branstad goal was to increase Iowa family incomes by 25%. Here was another miserable failure. According to the same Register study incomes have gone up just 0.17%.\n\n#2- Branstad packed the Iowa Board of Medicine with people that did away with Planned Parenthood\u2019s telemedicine arrangement.\n\n#1- Instead of expanding Medicare, Branstad tried to push through a vastly inferior health insurance plan called the \u201cHealthy Iowa Plan\u201d.\n\n#0- A state auditor report has found there have been 42 settlement agreements by this Administration totaling $2.4 million dollars.\n\nThese reasons should give everyone pause about re-electing Terry Branstad. Another reason may be his health.\n\nAt the first debate, Branstad\u2019s shaking hands and erratic behavior was plainly evident. Does he have Parkinson\u2019s disease or something like that? The rumors persist that if re-elected Branstad will step down after a time and allow the incredibly average Kim Reynolds to become governor without having to go through an election.", "article_metadata": {}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd37ca\"", "article_summary": "These reasons should give everyone pause about re-electing Terry Branstad.\nHere are twenty reasons not to re-elect Terry Branstad-#20- Branstad\u2019s campaign pulled a dirty trick by creating a fake Jack Hatch website.\n#7- Branstad\u2019s Administration took the Chief Administative Law Judge\u2019s position and made it susceptible to political pressure from the Governor\u2019s office.\n#17- In an insult to the principle of the separation of church and state, Branstad was an active participant and signed a state declaration for Bob Vander Plaats\u2019s \u201cDay of Prayer and Fasting\u201d.\n#3- Another big Branstad goal was to increase Iowa family incomes by 25%."}
