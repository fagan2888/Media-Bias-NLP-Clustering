The exchanges, one of the components of the Affordable Care Act, opened on schedule. But the were paralyzed almost instantly by heavy traffic and widespread computer glitches. Millions of people attempted to access the exchanges, but very few got through.\n\nMarketplace has done a lot of reporting on the exchanges in the past few months. We've compiled some of the best reporting -- and other links -- to help guide people through the process.\n\n1. What is healthcare.gov?\n\nThis is the main site to enter the federally operated insurance exchanges. It includes a handy glossary of all the terms you'll need to know.\n\n2. Am I eligible for subsidies, and where can I sign up?\n\nMost states have hired advisors, known as navigators, to help consumers navigate the health-care maze. But, there are also several sites to guide you thru the process.\n\nEach state has it's own exchange, more than 30 of which are operated -- at least in part -- by the federal government. The rest are operated by the states themselves. You can look up the link to your state's page at federal site. Some of the big individual state exchanges are:\n\n3. How much will insurance cost on the exchanges?\n\nIt depends. Plans come in several different tiers -- bronze, silver, gold, platinum -- and with different premiums, co-pays and deductibles.\n\nA recent report from the Department of Health and Human Services uses the example of a healthy 27-year-old. He or she would pay $163 a month, on average, for the basic 'bronze' plan and $240 a month for 'gold' coverage, the most comprehensive plan. President Obama said in a speech yesterday that those rates were 'less than the cost of your cell phone bill.' JB Silvers is a professor of Healthcare Finance at Case Western Reserve\u2019s Weatherhead School of Management. He says he\u2019s impressed by the rates. \u201cI\u2019m actually surprised they\u2019re coming in so well. They\u2019re very competitive and they definitely will save consumers money,\u201d he says.\n\nSome other issues related to cost involve who actually will sign up: For instance, will healthy, young consumers sign up? Healthy folks help keep costs down for the entire system. (That's how insurance works!)\n\nAnd remember, like all health insurance, the Obamacare premiums don't take into account all costs, as it relates to health care.\n\n4. Will it all work?\n\nAnother tough question to answer. Computer glitches and tech problems on the federal exchanges have been epic. Administration officials are working on the problems, but they could last for weeks. Plus, remember the deadlines are rolling.\n\nHere are the important dates to know as the health care roll-out begins:\n\nOctober 1, 2013 - Open enrollment starts\n\nJanuary 1, 2014 - Health coverage begins for those who enroll by Dec. 15\n\nMarch 31, 2014 - Open enrollment ends\n\n**This article was updated on Oct. 9, 2013.", "article_metadata": {"csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "application-name": "Marketplace from APM", "og": {"url": "http://www.marketplace.org/2013/10/01/health-care/affordable-care-act-step-step-guide-online-insurance-marketplaces", "image": "http://cms.marketplace.org/sites/default/files/styles/primary-image-900x500/public/obamacare-application.JPG?itok=9VsswIKM", "type": "article", "description": "Looking for the healthcare marketplace in California, New York or your state?
