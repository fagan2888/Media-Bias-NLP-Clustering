Now, a new study provides evidence to support theories, which suggest one possible treatment for Alzheimer\u2019s patients would be to eliminate the protein from their brains completely.\n\nThe study analyzes the case of a very rare occurrence: a California man whose body does not produce any APOE whatsoever, though his brain functions in a completely normal manner as do his eyes, two key locations where the protein is found. \u201cThis suggests that functions of APOE in the brain and eye are not essential or that redundant mechanisms exist whereby its role can be fulfilled,\u201d wrote the authors.\n\nWithin our bodies, APOE\u2019s job is to package cholesterol and other fats and move them through the bloodstream. (The name of the gene and the protein it produces are both the same: APOE.) The major kinds (or alleles) of APOE gene are called e2, e3, and e4, with the most common being e3, found in more than half of the general population. About 20 percent of people carry APOE4, which is linked to Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nThe study began when a 40-year-old African-American man showed up at the Lipid Clinic, University of California, San Francisco, suffering from severe hyperlipidemia. His condition causes too high a level of lipids in the bloodstream, which usually goes hand in hand with having high cholesterol. He sought treatment at the clinic because the status quo statin medications and fibrate treatments weren\u2019t working to correct his cholesterol levels. After running tests, researchers found he suffers from a very rare condition, which disrupts his body's processing of cholesterol and causes painful growths of fat under the skin. While this condition is often a result of low levels of APOE, this man\u2019s body lacked the protein entirely.\n\n\u201cAPOE has a purpose but maybe there are ways to get around that,\u201d Dr. Mary Malloy, director of UC San Francisco and co-author of the study, told Bloomberg. \u201cMaybe another protein can take over.\u201d The authors of an editorial appearing with the study express the idea more succinctly: The lack of neurological damage in this patient \u201cwould appear to answer the question of whether apoE is necessary for brain function with a resounding no.\u201d Let the research begin to develop new and more effective drugs for the disease which worsens over time and currently affects more than five million Americans.\n\nSource: Mak ACY, Pullinger CR, Tang LF, et al.
