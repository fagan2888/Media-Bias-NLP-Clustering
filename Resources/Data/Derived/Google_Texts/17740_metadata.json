Why can't they all be like you?\"\n\nThat type of statement makes Mohamed a token, she said, and plays to the stereotype that African American's aren't approachable.\n\n\"It's one of those backhanded compliments as a woman of color to be told 'Oh why can't they all be like you,'\" she said.\n\nThese types of statements aren't usually deliberate, said sociology graduate student Tamara Williams Van Horn, who's studying race, gender and sexuality.\n\n\"It doesn't have to be intentional or deliberate or even hateful, but it leaves the other person feeling diminished and not with the same status,\" Van Horn said. \"They can be very innocent or accidental.\"\n\nMicroaggressions often go beyond race to affect gender, class, sexual orientation and other groups of marginalized students, said Franky Navarrette, one of the co-organizers of the project.\n\nWhile campaigns at other schools have focused mostly on race, Navarrette said it was important to create a space for all marginalized groups to come together on the CU Tumblr.\n\n\"The reality is that the oppression these groups face is interconnected and stems from the same place,\" Navarrette said. \"No one struggle is more important than the other, all are equally important. Our collective liberation is the goal. Each one of us has to recognize our privileges and see where we can be allies to each other, and stand in solidarity.\"\n\nNavarrette said the Tumblr is also statement about \"honest representation\" of minority and marginalized students on campus. Many students feel that the university has \"tokenized\" underrepresented students by using them in pamphlets and other university materials to reflect the campus's diversity, Navarrette said.\n\nNavarrette said the campaign is a starting point for actions that make everyone feel safe and included on the Boulder campus.\n\n\"We need action and we need it now,\" Navarrette said. \"If students do not feel safe and included, then there is a barrier to learning and if there is a barrier to learning then the university is not doing its job right.\"\n\nContact Camera Staff Writer Sarah Kuta at 303-473-1106 or kutas@dailycamera.com", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/cu-news/ci_25396016/i-too-am-cu-campaign-highlights-microaggressions-cu", "sailthru.author": "By Sarah Kuta   Camera Staff Writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:25396016:view"}, "startDate": "2014-03-22T14:00:00-0600", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "Students at the University of Colorado are hoping to draw attention to the experiences of underrepresented students on campus through a photo campaign called  \"I, too, am CU.", "title": "'I, too, am CU' campaign highlights microaggressions on CU-Boulder campus", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/cu-news/ci_25396016/i-too-am-cu-campaign-highlights-microaggressions-cu", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2014/0321/20140321__23dcaiamw~1.jpg", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "CU News", "modificationDate": "2014-03-22T15:59:14-0600", "endDate": "2024-03-21T17:45:27-0600", "news_keywords": "CU News, CU News news, Boulder Colorado CU News news, Boulder Colorado news, CU News Boulder news, CU News Colorado news, US CU News news, world CU News news.", "byline": "By Sarah Kuta", "pubDate": "2014-03-21T17:52:33-0600", "sailthru.date": "2014-03-22T14:00:00-0600", "sailthru.title": "'I, too, am CU' campaign highlights microaggressions on CU-Boulder campus", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2014/0321/20140321__23dcaiamw~1_300.jpg", "description": "Students at the University of Colorado are hoping to draw attention to the experiences of underrepresented students on campus through a photo campaign called  \"I, too, am CU.", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/cu-news/ci_25396016/i-too-am-cu-campaign-highlights-microaggressions-cu", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "Students at the University of Colorado are hoping to draw attention to the experiences of underrepresented students on campus through a photo campaign called  \"I, too, am CU.", "title": "'I, too, am CU' campaign highlights microaggressions on CU-Boulder campus"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2014/0321/20140321__23dcaiamw~1.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca553\"", "article_summary": "Students hope to draw attention to experiences of underrepresented studentsI, too, am CU Tumblr http://itooamcu.tumblr.com/Students at the University of Colorado are hoping to draw attention to the experiences of underrepresented students on campus through a photo campaign called \"I, too, am CU.\"\nNavarrette said the campaign is a starting point for actions that make everyone feel safe and included on the Boulder campus.\nNavarrette said the Tumblr is also statement about \"honest representation\" of minority and marginalized students on campus.\nMohamed is writing an honors thesis about microaggressions, and said she was inspired by the success of the Harvard photo compilation.\nWhile campaigns at other schools have focused mostly on race, Navarrette said it was important to create a space for all marginalized groups to come together on the CU Tumblr."}
