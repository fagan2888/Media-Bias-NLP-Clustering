And in those five years, I have been producing Halloween consistently,\u201d said Richardson last week. \u201cThe first three years in, I produced the parade and costume ball in Brattleboro (Vermont). Last year, I moved to western Massachusetts and found a new home and new community to share the magic of creativity and street theatre with in Northampton.\u201d\n\nRichardson noted that the creative nature of the town reminds him of Greenwich Village, \u201cbut smaller.\u201d He described Northampton as \u201cdynamic and very alive in spirit and participation. It\u2019s a very diverse community. It\u2019s is alive and open to people with new ideas and most of all, it is teeming with creatives of all persuasions.\u201d\n\nAlthough he\u2019s been a New Englander for the past few years, Richardson has managed to keep his hands in the New York Caribbean carnival/costume scene.\n\nThe veteran designer traveled down to Brooklyn to participate in last year\u2019s J\u2019Ouvert procession with fellow Trinidadian- American Gregory Young.
