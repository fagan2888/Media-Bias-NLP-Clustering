Can they stop acting like if they can just upset women enough, they\u2019ve won a moral victory? Case in point: The showdown this week at the University of Central Florida over graphic abortion imagery.\n\nThe provocatively named \u201cGenocide Awareness Project\u201d from the Center of Bio-Ethical Reform is currently making its seventh visit to the campus this week, positioning itself near the campus reflecting pond, in front of the library, with a display that includes photographs from abortions. The group is also passing out literature and engaging in \u201cdiscussions and debates\u201d with students. Fletcher Armstrong, the group\u2019s national field director, promised the Orlando Sentinel Sunday that \u201cYou see arms pulled off, decapitation, dismemberment, that\u2019s what you see\u2026. Frankly, it\u2019s hard to show. But if we don\u2019t show it, people don\u2019t get it.\u201d And just to make a point, in addition to vivid images of aborted fetuses, the displays also feature images of dead bodies from the 1994 Rwandan genocide. Armstrong estimates that \u201can average of five to 15 percent\u201d of visitors who participate in the group\u2019s opinion poll wind up changing their minds on the issue, though he says that figure is \u201cnot scientific.\u201d\n\nThe bloody fetus strategy has a subtler, but also emotionally manipulative cousin in the \u201cinformed consent\u201d rules like the one being mulled in Missouri this month \u2013 which would require women seeking abortions to watch an \u201cinformational\u201d video about the procedure. And the tactic of showing, as graphically as possible, the results of abortion remains the same. It\u2019s designed to incite a strong reaction \u2013 and sometimes, unfortunately, it works. Last year, a group called Survivors of the Abortion Holocaust \u2013 another Christian group known for its deployment of \u201coverwhelmingly bloody and gory pictures,\u201d brought its campaign to the University of California at Santa Barbara. It was a visit that culminated in a heated exchange between the visitors and feminist professor Dr. Mireille Miller-Young, one in which Dr. Miller-Young came away looking like the aggressor, and the protestors were embraced by the right wing media as victims of an \u201cattack.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "An \"awareness project\" reveals the dirty tactics of reproductive rights foes", "title": "Anti-choicers: Stop bullying women with bloody photos", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "An \"awareness project\" reveals the dirty tactics of reproductive rights foes", "title": "Anti-choicers: Stop bullying women with bloody photos", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/02/17/anti_choicers_stop_bullying_women_with_bloody_photos/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/02/abortion_protest2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "An \"awareness project\" reveals the dirty tactics of reproductive rights foes", "title": "Anti-choicers: Stop bullying women with bloody photos", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/02/abortion_protest2.jpg", "creator": "@embeedub", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Mary Elizabeth Williams", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Abortion, Center of Bio-Ethical Reform, Florida, Genocide Awareness Project, Reproductive Rights, UCF", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Can they stop acting like if they can just upset women enough, they\u2019ve won a moral victory?\nCase in point: The showdown this week at the University of Central Florida over graphic abortion imagery.\nTopics: Abortion, Center of Bio-Ethical Reform, Florida, Genocide Awareness Project, Reproductive Rights, UCF, Life NewsCan the opponents of reproductive choice please stop resorting to underhanded, manipulative tactics to try to frighten women out of having abortions already?\nAnd the tactic of showing, as graphically as possible, the results of abortion remains the same.\nThe group is also passing out literature and engaging in \u201cdiscussions and debates\u201d with students."}
