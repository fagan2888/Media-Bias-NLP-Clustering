The festival\u2019s centerpiece film reunites Mr. Perry with the actress, who appeared in his last effort, the acerbic literary comedy \u201cListen Up Philip,\u201d along with Jason Schwartzman and Jonathan Pryce.\n\nRelated What to See at BAMcinemaFest\n\n\n\n\n\nMr. Perry began work on the new film last year not long after \u201cPhilip\u201d had its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival. His new film\u2019s intimate scale, tight crew and fixed location\u2014a lake house in upstate New York\u2014helped bolster a severe dramatic turn. \u201cThe less fingers you have in the pie,\u201d he said, \u201cthe purer it will taste.\u201d\n\nMs. Moss, he said, was onboard right away, making it easier to cast co-star Katherine Waterston. The director said he had become fascinated by \u201cradical departures\u201d in the work of prolific filmmakers, such as the Woody Allen\u2019s \u201cInteriors.\u201d \u201cWhere basically the intention is you make this austere miserable drama with no jokes after you make \u2018Annie Hall,\u2019 \u201d he said.\n\nMr. Perry\u2019s career has been nurtured by the festival, which featured his second film \u201cThe Color Wheel\u201d in 2011 and prides itself on advocating for new cinematic talents.\n\n\u201cOur brand is much stronger now,\u201d said Gabriele Caroti, director of BAMcinematek. \u201cFive years ago, we didn\u2019t have the edict of focusing on American independent cinema. I think we\u2019ve really honed the festival. It\u2019s sharper and tighter.\u201d\n\nENLARGE A scene from Nathan Silver\u2019s \u2018Stinking Heaven\u2019 Photo: Nathan Silver\n\nThe increased star wattage hasn\u2019t dimmed the festival\u2019s taste for movies that push the form. Among them are films that explore unusual camera choices (an iPhone in \u201cTangerine,\u201d Betacam video in \u201cStinking Heaven\u201d) and those that mess with story structure (the surreal comedy \u201cUncle Kent 2\u201d turns from mumblecore into a kind of live-action cartoon; \u201cA Woman Like Me\u201d mixes documentary and fiction to reimagine its co-director\u2019s cancer experience).\n\nAlthough much of BAMcinemaFest is booked with favorites that had their premieres at the Sundance and South by Southwest film festivals, there also are more recent discoveries.\n\nChicago filmmaker Stephen Cone is near the start of his festival run with \u201cHenry Gamble\u2019s Birthday Party.\u201d The ensemble drama runs the course of a day in which a minister\u2019s son turns 17 and celebrates with a pool party. Everyone, it seems, has a secret, which serves Mr. Cone\u2019s assertion that \u201creligious people are forced to live inside physical bodies despite themselves a little bit.\u201d The cast, which features a number of Chicago stage actors, and polished cinematography lends a mainstream vibe to a plot that is textured and subversive.\n\nENLARGE Cole Doman in \u2018Henry Gamble\u2019s Birthday Party\u2019 Photo: Cone Arts\n\n\u201cI\u2019m grateful there\u2019s a springtime wave of festivals with sharp curatorial eyes looking for these films,\u201d Mr. Cone said. \u201cBecause otherwise we\u2019re lost.\u201d\n\nSome selections are notable simply for the perspective of their storytelling. Filmmaker Kris Swanberg, also from Chicago, made two smaller features before she co-wrote and directed \u201cUnexpected.\u201d Like Mr. Perry\u2014whose film has Joe Swanberg, Ms. Swanberg\u2019s filmmaker husband, as a producer\u2014she was able to attract a familiar actress. Cobie Smulders, late of the CBS comedy \u201cHow I Met Your Mother\u201d and \u201cAvengers: Age of Ultron,\u201d plays an inner-city high-school teacher who bonds with one of her students when they both discover they are pregnant.\n\n\u201cWe clicked so hard and she related to the script so much,\u201d said Ms. Swanberg, who based the story on her own experiences. \u201cI was looking for naturalistic performances, someone who could act like themselves and have a real conversation and seem like a human, and someone who could be funny. She checked all the boxes.\u201d\n\nThe film, Ms. Swanberg said, reflected anxieties about motherhood, which she hadn\u2019t seen represented in film from a woman\u2019s perspective.\n\n\u201cThere was a constant debate in my own head whether I\u2019m working or whether I\u2019m staying home,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s something my husband doesn\u2019t go through. He\u2019s not racked with guilt the whole time. It\u2019s something really unique to women.\u201d\n\nIt didn\u2019t hurt that Ms. Smulders, who came to the \u201cUnexpected\u201d set fresh from shooting the romantic comedy \u201cResults\u201d with microbudget pioneer Andrew Bujalski, was six months pregnant.\n\n\u201cWhich is, you know, a good amount of pregnant,\u201d Ms. Swanberg said, laughing.", "article_metadata": {"article.template":
