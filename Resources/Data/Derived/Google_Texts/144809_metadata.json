But frankly, we knew that. The deeper message of the bipartisan report was that Republicans in Congress wasted a year arguing about what turned out to be mostly phony issues.\n\nWhat these pundits forget\u2014and, as Christie, a former U.S. attorney, knows as well as anyone\u2014is the old saw that federal prosecutors can get a grand jury to indict a ham sandwich. They don\u2019t need a bulletproof case. And once they have a target, they aren\u2019t limited to investigating the matter that caught their attention; public corruption probes often widen as new information emerges. Federal prosecutors rarely have just one attack route. Remember, they brought down Al Capone for income tax evasion, not bribery, bootlegging, or murder. The Fort Lee incident may be merely a bridge, if you will, to other Christie administration misconduct. As a former target of a federal investigation that started in one place and ended in a very different one, I\u2019m all too familiar with the unpredictable directions in which these things can go. What piques a prosecutor\u2019s interest during plea negotiations may be totally unrelated to the original crime.\n\nRom-denfreude (noun) \u2014 The pleasure Mitt Romney loyalists are taking in the struggles of Chris Christie.\n\nThe condition is prevalent, stemming from a range of perceived Christie slights towards Romney during the 2012 campaign, which several Romney loyalists ticked off quickly \u2014 and with still-evident bitterness.\n\nA Republican operative at a large super PAC used the same metaphor \u2014 a favorite among political observers at the moment \u2014 to describe the unease in the party. \u201cEveryone thinks there\u2019s probably a 60% chance the other shoe will drop,\u201d said the operative, who like many of the people quoted in this story, requested anonymity to speak freely about a situation that is still evolving. \u201cWhen I saw the press conference, I said, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s lying\u2026 But for the deputy chief of staff to do something like that requires a culture in the office that he would have set, and it probably requires other examples that would have made her feel like that was acceptable to do.\u201d He added, \u201cMy gut is that they\u2019ll probably find something else.\u201d\n\nHealth Markets Inc., an insurance agency that enrolled around 7,500 people in exchange plans, said 65% of its enrollees had prior coverage. Around 10% were dropping out of employer coverage, either because the employer stopped offering its plan or because they could qualify for subsidies on the marketplaces. Fifteen percent had previous individual plans canceled, and 40% decided to switch into coverage bought through an exchange from previous individual plans. At Michigan-based Priority Health, only 25% of more than 1,000 enrollees surveyed in plans that comply with the law were previously uninsured, said Joan Budden, chief marketing officer. The trend underscores a central test for the health law, whose marketplaces are meant to steer a broad cross section of new paying customers to private insurers.\n\nIt's interesting, though it's very preliminary, and open enrollment is barely halfway done. But it's the WSJ, so it's worrisome because all WSJ stories about Obamacare show \"worrisome\" results. Contrast that with Wellpoint and Aetna . And also Don\u2019t believe the hype: Health insurers think Obamacare is going to be fine.\n\nNY Times:\n\nNew York City\u2019s top elected officials said on Friday that they would greatly expand the reach of a measure mandating paid time off for sick workers, a cherished cause of the national left that had long been resisted by local business leaders.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Daily Kos", "description": "UPDATE: Christie camp held Sandy relief money hostage, mayor alleges via Steve Kornacki.", "title": "Abbreviated Pundit Round-up: More on Christie, ACA and GOP overreach", "url": "http://www.dailykos.com/story/2014/1/18/1270591/-Abbreviated-Pundit-Round-up-More-on-Christie-ACA-and-GOP-overreach", "image": "http://assets.dailykos.com/assets/fb_default-83551080ce5aec223661e373eaf232ea.png", "type": "article"}, "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "fb": {"app_id": 170357783709}, "twitter": {"description": "UPDATE: Christie camp held Sandy relief money hostage, mayor alleges via Steve Kornacki.\ncongrats Christie-not many sitting Govs can say their deputy chief of staff, outgoing/incoming chief of staf...", "title": "Abbreviated Pundit Round-up: More on Christie, ACA and GOP overreach", "site": "@dailykos", "card": "summary", "creator": "@demfromct"}}, "article_summary": "Federal prosecutors rarely have just one attack route.\nWhat these pundits forget\u2014and, as Christie, a former U.S. attorney, knows as well as anyone\u2014is the old saw that federal prosecutors can get a grand jury to indict a ham sandwich.\nThe Fort Lee incident may be merely a bridge, if you will, to other Christie administration misconduct.\nRom-denfreude (noun) \u2014 The pleasure Mitt Romney loyalists are taking in the struggles of Chris Christie.\nDavid Ignatius:The Senate intelligence committee made headlines this week by reporting that the 2012 attack in Benghazi was preventable."}
