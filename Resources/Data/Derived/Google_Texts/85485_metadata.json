(AP) - SMU senior Bryson DeChambeau advanced to the U.S. Amateur final, putting him a victory away from becoming the fifth player to win the tournament and NCAA individual title in the same year.\n\nDeChambeau, from Clovis, California, beat Southern California sophomore Sean Crocker 4 and 3 in the semifinals Saturday at Olympia Fields. He will face Virginia junior Derek Bard of New Hartford, New York, in the 36-hole final Sunday. Bard topped Japan\u2019s Kenta Konishi 3 and 2.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be a fun battle,\u201d DeChambeau said. \u201cIf I can stay in the moment, I\u2019ll be all right.\u201d\n\nJack Nicklaus (1961), Phil Mickelson (1990), Tiger Woods (1996) and Ryan Moore (2004) are the only players to sweep the NCAA and Amateur titles in a season.\n\n\u201cTo be in that group of players would be incredible, but I still have work to do,\u201d DeChambeau said. \u201cI\u2019m just going to play my game.\u201d\n\nDeChambeau won the par-4 eighth and ninth holes with pars to take a 2-up lead. Crocker won the par-4 11th with a birdie, but DeChambeau took the next three holes - birdieing the par-4 12th and 14th - and ended the match with a par for a halve on the par-3 15th.\n\nA physics major who plays with a set of irons all cut to 6-iron length, DeChambeau was the equivalent of 3 under on his 15 holes and is 18 under in five match-play rounds.\n\nBard won the 12th, 14th and 15th holes and finished off Konishi with a par for a halve on the par-4 16th.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the underdog,\u201d Bard said about the title match. \u201cBryson has had an incredible career so far. It\u2019s going to be tough. It really is. I told my dad, \u2018I\u2019m going to have to play my best golf to have a chance.\u2019\u201d\n\nKonishi was trying to become the first Japanese winner in the event.\n\n\u201cAll day, he hit it straight,\u201d Konishi said through an interpreter. \u201cSometimes, the opponent makes mistakes, and he didn\u2019t make a mistake.\u201d\n\nDeChambeau and Bard earned spots next year in the Masters and U.S. Open. The winner Sunday also will get a spot in the British Open.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been my dream since I was a little kid to play in the Masters as a professional,\u201d Bard said. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I\u2019d be doing that at age 20.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "SMU senior Bryson DeChambeau advanced to the U.S. Amateur final, putting him a victory away from becoming the fifth player to win the tournament and NCAA individual title in the same year.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "SMU senior Bryson DeChambeau advanced to the U.S. Amateur final, putting him a victory away from becoming the fifth player to win the tournament and NCAA individual title in the same year.", "title": "DeChambeau, Bard advance to US Amateur final", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/22/dechambeau-bard-advance-to-us-amateur-final/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/22/1dd32bbfa8d6c9257f0f6a7067002f34.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/22/1dd32bbfa8d6c9257f0f6a7067002f34.jpg", "description": "SMU senior Bryson DeChambeau advanced to the U.S. Amateur final, putting him a victory away from becoming the fifth player to win the tournament and NCAA individual title in the same year.", "card": "summary", "title": "DeChambeau, Bard advance to US Amateur final"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "Bard won the 12th, 14th and 15th holes and finished off Konishi with a par for a halve on the par-4 16th.\nHe will face Virginia junior Derek Bard of New Hartford, New York, in the 36-hole final Sunday.\nAmateur final, putting him a victory away from becoming the fifth player to win the tournament and NCAA individual title in the same year.\nDeChambeau, from Clovis, California, beat Southern California sophomore Sean Crocker 4 and 3 in the semifinals Saturday at Olympia Fields.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been my dream since I was a little kid to play in the Masters as a professional,\u201d Bard said."}
