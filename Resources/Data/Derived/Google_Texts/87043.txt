CENTENNIAL, Colo. -- A fire at an apartment building in Centennial was intentionally set according to fire investigators Tuesday.

Rescuers say it's a miracle no one was killed or more seriously hurt, although eight people were injured as they scrambled to make daring escapes from the 3-story unit early Monday morning.

Investigators are awaiting more results from the Colorado Bureau of Investigation's lab tests.

But they have narrowed down the location of where the fire began, and they have said that some type of accelerant was used.

Dave Young has new details in his video report.
