Ted Cruz was furious at the Supreme Court\u2019s recent rulings on health care subsidies and gay marriage. And there was nothing surprising about his proposed remedies: a Constitutional amendment empowering states to define marriage, a law to strip federal courts of jurisdiction over such questions; and an end to lifetime judicial appointments.\n\nThere was, however, something telling about one part of his argument. In deploring the weakness of the Congress in failing to remove \u201clawless\u201d judges from the bench, Sen. Cruz wrote: \u201cA Senate that cannot muster 51 votes to block an attorney-general nominee openly committed to continue an unprecedented course of executive-branch lawlessness can hardly be expected to muster the 67 votes needed to impeach an Anthony Kennedy.\u201d (He meant \u201cconvict,\u201d not \u201cimpeach\u201d; that\u2019s the province of the House of Representatives). Note his target: Justice Kennedy was the only one of the five pro gay marriage judges on the Court who was appointed by a Republican president.\n\nSen. Cruz\u2019s fury followed by one day the fury over the votes of Justice Kennedy and Chief Justice John Roberts to sanction subsidies for federally established health care exchanges, effectively securing Obamacare\u2019s future. The right raged, raising the possibility Justice Roberts had been blackmailed by the \u201cObama regime.\u201d\n\nAnd therein lies a tale, about a decades-long frustration within the conservative community about the men (and one woman) that have been named to the high court by their ostensible political allies. Again and again, Republican nominees have been supporters, even authors, of some of the most \u201cliberal\u201d of Court decisions, while, at least in recent decades, Democratic nominees have been far less likely to stray. The question is whether the Roberts-Kennedy votes on health care, and Kennedy\u2019s gay rights rulings, represent a continuation of this pattern. On that score, there\u2019s reasonable doubt.\n\nSeveral justices picked by Democratic presidents have wound up as \u201cconservatives\u201d\u2014largely because they\u2019ve stuck to their judicial philosophies while the issues have changed. Felix Frankfurter was an ardent New Dealer, whose liberalism led him to argue that the Supreme Court should defer to Congress and the president when they passed and signed laws regulating the economy, or expanding labor rights. In the late \u201950s, that same belief in \u201cjudicial restraint\u201d led Frankfurter to defer to Congressional investigations of suspected subversives. And he refused to join the decision to compel \u201cone-man-one-vote\u201d legislatures; we should, Frankfurter argued, avoid the \u201cpolitical thicket.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, one-time liberal hero Hugo Black was one of two justices who dissented from the 1965 decision that found a Constitutional right to privacy in striking down Connecticut\u2019s ban on birth control. \u201cI like my privacy as well as the next one,\u201d he wrote, \u201cbut I am nevertheless compelled to admit that government has a right to invade it unless prohibited by some specific constitutional provision.\u201d This is the precise argument now embraced by conservatives in rejecting the reasoning that established a right to an abortion, or to same-sex marriage.\n\nAnd Byron White, John Kennedy\u2019s first appointment, embraced the same view when he dissented in Roe v. Wade, calling the idea of a right to abortion an exercise in \u201craw judicial power\u201d (shades of Antonin Scalia!). White, however, was the end of the line. Starting with Kennedy\u2019s second appointment, every justice named by a Democrat has been a reliably liberal vote. From Arthur Goldberg to Elena Kagan, these justices have reflected the essential \u201cjudicial liberal\u201d consensus.\n\nThe picture is dramatically different on the Republican side of the bench. Once upon a time, this could be explained by the fact that there was a time when \u201cliberal Republican\u201d was not an oxymoron. Two of Eisenhower\u2019s appointees, Earl Warren and William Brennan, helped lead the Court in the 1960s on issues ranging from school desegregation to expanded rights for accused criminals to greater free speech protection in areas of libel and obscenity. But even as the Republican Party became a more homogenized party, GOP-picked Justices kept infuriating the faithful. Richard Nixon made the Court\u2019s liberalism a campaign issue in 1968; but one of his appointees, Harry Blackmun, became one of the most liberal justices ever\u2014a strong defender of choice on abortion, a passionate foe of the death penalty. Warren Burger, also a Nixon pick, came out in support of the Roe v. Wade decision.\n\nRonald Reagan chose Sandra Day O\u2019Connor and Anthony Kennedy; she became a self-acknowledged \u201cswing justice,\u201d while Kennedy became the Court\u2019s apostle of privacy.\n\nGeorge H.W. Bush\u2019s pick of David Souter was proclaimed by Chief of Staff John Sununu as \u201ca strict constructionist, consistent with basic conservative attitudes.\u201d Justice Souter turned out to be a consistently liberal vote.\n\nJustice Souter was supposed to be the last such instance of a Republican justice drifting (or sliding or racing) to the left side of the bench. And it may well be that Justice Roberts\u2019 two votes to salvage the Affordable Care Act has more to do with his concern over throwing the Court into the middle of another political firestorm than with a more general legal philosophy. (It\u2019s worth wondering whether Justice Roberts would have voted the same way had he been simply an associate justice, without the burden of protecting the institution that the chief\u2019s role requires.) In most matters\u2014campaign finance, corporate interests, voting rights\u2014Justice Roberts has kept the implicit bargain to reflect the philosophy of the party whose president chose him.\n\nAnd what of the future? It\u2019s safe to assume that no Democratic president would choose a justice who\u2019s at all uncertain about upholding Roe v. Wade or same-sex marriage. But is it equally safe to assume that a Republican president would only want justices committed to overturning those decisions? Given the relief with which some Republicans greeted the same-sex marriage ruling, can social conservatives freely assume that a future GOP president would want that issue\u2014or abortion\u2014back in the political center ring? There\u2019s no doubt at all about the kind of justices a President Mike Huckabee would appoint. But a President Jeb Bush?\n\n***\n\nJeff Greenfield, author and five-time Emmy-winning network TV analyst, is the author of If Kennedy Lived: The First and Second Terms of President John F.
