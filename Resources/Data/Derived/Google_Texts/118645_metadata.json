Ron Kind of Wisconsin the lone Democrat to support the bill.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an iron law of economics that when you tax something, you get less of it,\u201d Chairman Paul Ryan, Wisconsin Republican, said in a prepared statement. \u201cSo we\u2019ve really got our wires crossed here. We want more medical devices. What we want less of is this bureaucratic meddling.\u201d\n\nDemocrats on the panel cried foul, saying the GOP failed to come up with the $26 billion needed to replace the revenue that will be lost over the decade by scrapping the tax.\n\n\u201cIs there going to be a pay-for?\u201d the committee\u2019s top Democrat, Rep. Sander Levin of Michigan, said. \u201cI think the answer is probably no.\u201d\n\nThe committee also voted 31-8 to repeal the Independent Payment Advisory Board, a panel created by Obamacare and tasked with keeping Medicare costs in check.\n\nAlthough no one\u2019s been appointed to the board, critics have decried it as a \u201cdeath panel\u201d of bureaucrats who ostensibly could rein in seniors\u2019 care. Seven committee Democrats joined every Republican in voting for its repeal.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, California Republican, is hoping to put each of the bills on the floor by mid-month.\n\nThe medical device tax took effect in 2013 and has been on the GOP\u2019s legislative chopping block since then, although members of both parties have hinted at repeal for more than a year.\n\nLawmakers from states with a high concentration of medical device companies are especially quick to say the tax is a job killer that needs to go, and Republicans are eager to roll back Obamacare where they can.\n\nMany Democrats, though, generally are reluctant to fiddle with President Obama\u2019s signature health care law. Party leaders have defended the tax, saying the manufacturers have more customers thanks to Obamacare, so they can afford to pay.\n\nRepublicans, meanwhile, argue the device industry has helped real patients and cut costs by making health care more efficient, so there is no reason to hamstring their progress.\n\n\u201cThe innovation has been astounding,\u201d Rep. Charles W. Boustany Jr., Louisiana Republican, said.\n\nIndustry studies say the medical device tax cost the sector more than 30,000 jobs in the first year alone. But the Congressional Research Service, in a report from January, said the effect would be more muted \u2014 a drop of less than 1 percent in employment for the industry.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A powerful House committee approved a bill Tuesday to repeal Obamacare's medical device tax, a provision that's been criticized by members of both parties as a misguided way to pay for the health overhaul.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A powerful House committee approved a bill Tuesday to repeal Obamacare\u2019s medical device tax, a provision that\u2019s been criticized by members of both parties as a misguided way to pay for the health overhaul.", "title": "House panel votes to repeal Obamacare\u2019s medical device tax", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/2/house-panel-votes-repeal-obamacares-medical-device/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/31/Obama_Trade.JPEG-05492.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/31/Obama_Trade.JPEG-05492.jpg", "description": "A powerful House committee approved a bill Tuesday to repeal Obamacare's medical device tax, a provision that's been criticized by members of both parties as a misguided way to pay for the health over", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "House panel votes to repeal Obamacare\u2019s medical device tax"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Ways And Means Committee"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe349d\"", "article_summary": "Industry studies say the medical device tax cost the sector more than 30,000 jobs in the first year alone.\nA powerful House committee approved a bill Tuesday to repeal Obamacare\u2019s medical device tax, a provision that\u2019s been criticized by members of both parties as a misguided way to pay for the health overhaul.\nThe medical device tax took effect in 2013 and has been on the GOP\u2019s legislative chopping block since then, although members of both parties have hinted at repeal for more than a year.\nParty leaders have defended the tax, saying the manufacturers have more customers thanks to Obamacare, so they can afford to pay.\nHouse Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, California Republican, is hoping to put each of the bills on the floor by mid-month."}
