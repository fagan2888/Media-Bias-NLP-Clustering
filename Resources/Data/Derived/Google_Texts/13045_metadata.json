Such claims had previously led to the arrest and conviction of three al-Jazeera journalists. However, Egypt wants proof from Clooney the government issued the warning.\n\n\u201cShe should say exactly who said that,\u201d said Interior Ministry Spokesman Abdel Latif. \u201cWhy not specify from the start who told her that? We have nothing against her.\u201d\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nPolice General Hany Abdellatif told The Guardian that Egypt never listed her for arrest.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing against Mrs. Amal,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe someone deceived her. Maybe members of the Muslim Brotherhood [an Egyptian opposition group] or others to delude her that there are no freedoms in Egypt.\u201d\n\nClooney released the report in February, before she decided to represent Mohamed Fahmy, one of the detained al-Jazeera journalists. She claimed \u201cthey\u201d\u2013 presumably Egyptian government officials\u2013 threatened her entire team with arrest over it.\n\n\u201cWhen I went to launch the report, first of all they stopped us from doing it in Cairo,\u201d she told The Guardian. \u201cThey said: \u2018Does the report criticise the army, the judiciary, or the government?\u2019 We said: \u2018Well, yes.\u2019 They said: \u2018Well then, you\u2019re risking arrest.\u2019\u201d\n\nClooney said Egypt\u2019s judicial system should be more independent because of \u201cthe wide powers that ministers had over judges.\u201d The report \u201chighlighted a record of selective prosecutions.\u201d A new judge granted the three men a retrial, but Clooney fears these flaws \u201cwill compromise the integrity of any second hearing.\u201d Instead, she is now lobbying for Egypt to deport Fahmy, who holds a Canadian passport, under new laws set in place from President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. The new law \u201callows for foreign convicts or suspects to be transferred to their country to serve their sentence or to be tried there.\u201d An Egyptian court originally sentenced the three men to seven to ten years in jail \u201cfor spreading lies to help a \u2018terrorist organization\u2019 \u2013 a reference to Egypt\u2019s outlawed Muslim Brotherhood.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are many different ways in which the transfer from Egypt to Canada can occur, and as long as there is a genuine commitment on both sides, I see no reason why a transfer can\u2019t happen in fairly quick terms,\u201d said Clooney.\n\nShe wants to meet with Canadian foreign minister John Baird to move the process along.\n\n\u201cWe are very much hoping that the Canadian and Egyptian officials we have contacted will engage with us fully to ensure that Mohamed is involved \u2013 through his counsel \u2013 in the discussions and that a fair outcome can be achieved as soon as possible,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Egyptian Government Denies Threatening Amal Clooney with Arrest", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Egyptian Government Denies Threatening Amal Clooney with Arrest", "title": "Egyptian Government Denies Threatening Amal Clooney with Arrest - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/Amal-clooney-AP.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2015/01/04/egyptian-government-denies-threatening-amal-clooney-with-arrest/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Egyptian Government Denies Threatening Amal Clooney with Arrest", "title": "Egyptian Government Denies Threatening Amal Clooney with Arrest - Breitbart", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/Amal-clooney-AP.jpg", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "al-Jazeera, Amal Clooney, Cairo, canada, Corruption, Egypt, George Clooney, Islam, Muslim, Muslim Brotherhood, terrorism, The Guardian,National Security,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "National Security", "tag": "The Guardian", "published_time": "2015-01-04T10:57:15-07:00", "categories": "National Security"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "However, Egypt wants proof from Clooney the government issued the warning.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERHuman rights lawyer Amal Clooney, who married Hollywood superstar George Clooney in September, claimed Egypt threatened her with arrest due to a report she released that was critical of the country\u2019s judicial system.\nShe claimed \u201cthey\u201d\u2013 presumably Egyptian government officials\u2013 threatened her entire team with arrest over it.\nWe have nothing against her.\u201dSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERPolice General Hany Abdellatif told The Guardian that Egypt never listed her for arrest.\nSuch claims had previously led to the arrest and conviction of three al-Jazeera journalists."}
