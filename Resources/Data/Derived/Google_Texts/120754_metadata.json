(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nIt was one of the first political events Bernie Sanders ever went to in Vermont: a 1971 discussion by a small group of left-wingers, the Liberty Union Party.\n\nThese people were not winners, in the electoral sense. The closest they had come to winning a statewide race, at that point, was losing by 56 points. So someone in the audience asked: Why don\u2019t you become Democrats? Why not sacrifice third-party purity for a chance at actual power?\n\nSanders \u2014 a transplanted Brooklynite, known in Vermont for his overheated writing and underwhelming carpentry \u2014 spoke up from the crowd. The sacrifice wasn\u2019t worth it.\n\n\u201cHe felt strongly that you worked outside the Democratic Party,\u201d said Jim Rader, a longtime friend who took Sanders to the meeting. \u201cHe felt there were too many compromises that had to be made, too many compromises of political principles.\u201d\n\nLast week, 44 years later, a group of socialists gathered in a Vermont library to have a strikingly similar debate. This time, they were deciding whether they could support Bernie Sanders himself.\n\n\n\nPatrick St. John speaks during a meeting of the Burlington chapter of the International Socialist Organization on July 22 at the Fletcher Free Library in Burlington, Vt. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nSanders was not at this meeting. The scruffy socialist of the \u201970s \u2014 who later became a mayor, congressman and U.S. senator \u2014 is out on the campaign trail now, drawing huge crowds as a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nIn Vermont, the socialists\u2019 speaker said his answer was no. The purest socialist in mainstream American politics was no longer pure enough.\n\n\n\nJim Ramey addresses the meeting. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cWhen Sanders decided to run as a Democrat,\u201d that was the last straw, said Jim Ramey at the meeting of the International Socialist Organization\u2019s Burlington branch. \u201cPeople on the left should not support him.\u201d\n\nThe story of Bernie Sanders\u2019s life in politics is the distance between those two meetings.\n\nSanders got his start on Vermont\u2019s left fringe. In multiple third-party runs for office, he learned the craft of politics, which has been the only steady work he has ever had. Sanders also developed the same policy ideas that still define him: taxing the rich, expanding the safety net for the poor and weakening the influence of Wall Street.\n\nBut if Sanders kept the fringe\u2019s ideas, he quickly discarded its small-bore tactics \u2014 and began making allies, and compromises, that would bring him bigger audiences and higher office.\n\nThe result is that Vermont is strewn with dissatisfied socialists, denouncing Sanders for perceived sins that go back to the \u201970s.\n\nAnd Bernie Sanders is running for president.\n\n\n\nJim Rader has been a longtime Sanders ally. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cA very skilled and savvy politician,\u201d said Rader, who later worked in Sanders\u2019s congressional office, so close to Sanders that they shared one well-used necktie. \u201cHe\u2019s not a purist. He\u2019s consistent. He holds very deep convictions. But he is not a purist.\u201d\n\nSanders was born in Brooklyn, the son of a paint salesman, and became involved in left-wing politics at the University of Chicago. He arrived in Vermont in a wave of newcomers, back-to-the-landers. They didn\u2019t make a habit of asking one another where they had come from.\n\n\u201cHe was poor as a church mouse back then . . . living in an apartment that I always referred to as dark, stark and cluttered,\u201d said Darcy Troville, a friend from those early days. Sanders had been divorced years before. He had a son, whose mother and he never married. \u201cI was wondering how he ended up with this baby alone. I didn\u2019t know what he did for work,\u201d Troville said.\n\nIf Bernie Sanders had a great talent at that time, it was not obvious.\n\nHe wrote for the Vermont Freeman, a counter-culture newspaper, for $10 or $15 a story, including an especially strange piece about dark sexual fantasies. Sanders also did some carpentry. Nobody remembers the writing or the woodworking well.\n\nThe thing Sanders was good at, it turned out, was politics.\n\nBut even that wasn\u2019t clear right away.\n\n\n\nJohn Bloch has known Sanders for decades. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have a chance in hell,\u201d John Bloch said, recalling a meeting of the Liberty Union Party in 1971, when members were seeking nominees to run for the U.S. Senate. \u201cI said, \u2018Is there anybody that can be lion bait for the Senate race? We need a body.\u2019 \u201d\n\nSanders volunteered.\n\nIn his first radio interview as a candidate, he later recalled, his nervous knees knocked the table so loudly that the microphone picked it up. \u201cA strange thumping noise traversed the airwaves,\u201d Sanders wrote in his 1997 autobiography, as the sound engineer waved at him to stop it.\n\nThe message that Sanders used in that campaign is present in this one. \u201cWealth=power, lack of wealth=subservience. How could we change that?\u201d he recalled in his autobiography, called \u201cOutsider in the House.\u201d \u201cThe ideas I was espousing were not \u2018far out\u2019 or \u2018fringe.\u2019 Frankly, they were \u2018mainstream.\u2019 \u201d\n\nMaybe. But Sanders wasn\u2019t. He got 2 percent of the vote.\n\nIn 1974, Sanders ran for Senate again. Four percent.\n\nIn 1976, he ran for governor. Six percent. He was getting better at debates and retail politics. And at this rate, he would be up to an electoral majority in only . . . 44 more years.\n\nSo, in 1977, Sanders quit the party.\n\nIn the media, he called Liberty Union \u201ca failure.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t really think he had a right to do that,\u201d said Doris Lake, a former House candidate who had campaigned alongside Sanders in his first race. She meant bad-mouthing the party. \u201cWe were still keeping it alive.\u201d Not for the last time, Sanders had alienated one of the true believers with whom he had started out.\n\n\n\nOld Sanders campaign buttons. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cEnough was enough,\u201d Sanders told himself, he recalled in his autobiography. \u201cMy political career was over.\u201d\n\nTrouble was, his other career was worse.\n\nSanders made slide shows with audio for Vermont schools. But his operation was so painfully low-tech that he was stymied by the need for a \u201cbeep\u201d to tell the teacher to advance to the next slide. He couldn\u2019t afford a professional beep. \u201cHe tried banging a pot lid with a spoon,\u201d friend Terry Bouricius said. That wasn\u2019t a beep. Finally: \u201cHis son\u2019s walkie-talkies, if you pushed both the buttons at the same time, it would make a beep sound.\u201d\n\n\n\nSanders also tried to be a documentary filmmaker, with a movie about a personal role model: Eugene V. Debs, leader of the Socialist Party of America. Sanders did his hero\u2019s voice himself: \u201cOne class is small and rich and the other lahwge and poor,\u201d he read in his Brooklyn accent, according to audio discovered by Mother Jones magazine. He continued: \u201cOne consists of capitalists, and the other of work-uhs.\u201d\n\nDebs was from Indiana.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Bernie, you\u2019re not going to sell this thing. The soundtrack, Debs has a Brooklyn accent you can cut with a knife,\u2019 \u201d Bloch, his friend, remembered saying. Vermonters wouldn\u2019t understand it. \u201cHe said, \u2018They\u2019ll luuhn.\u2019 \u201d\n\nIt still wasn\u2019t much of a living. Sanders\u2019s landlord raised his rent, and he moved in with a friend.\n\nThen that friend, a University of Vermont professor, persuaded him to go back into politics \u2014 running for Burlington mayor as an independent, without the baggage of a larger party behind him. This time, Sanders focused on local issues: a waterfront development, fighting a tax increase, keeping a hill open for snow-sledding.\n\nHe won by 10 votes. That year, Sanders recalls, his friends chipped in and bought him something a mayor needs: a leather briefcase. He was 40 years old.\n\nSanders first faced strong opposition from Republicans and Democrats. He did some things that his old allies liked \u2014 he hung a picture of Debs in City Hall, he criticized U.S. policy in Central America, he set up an office to increase affordable housing, and he tried make cable TV cheaper for the poor.\n\nBut he still alienated some on the left, at times, by acting like a mayor instead of a socialist.\n\nIn 1983, for instance, some of Sanders\u2019s old allies planned to block the gates of a General Electric plant in Burlington that made guns for military helicopters. They would demand that the factory start making something peaceful instead.\n\n\n\nGreg Guma worked with Sanders and later wrote a book about him. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cHe said he would have us arrested,\u201d said Greg Guma, who had known Sanders since 1972. \u201cThen the day came. And he did.\u201d The socialist mayor sat quietly on a guardrail, watching them being handcuffed.\n\nIn the same period, Sanders also began a political relationship with the Democratic Party. He still denounced the party as ideologically bankrupt, part of a closed and corrupt two-party system.\n\nBut, when big elections came, he also campaigned for its candidates, as he did for Walter Mondale in 1984.\n\nThat lost him another socialist ally.\n\n\u201cThe friendship could not stand him storming around the state for Fritz Mondale,\u201d said Peter Diamondstone, one of Sanders\u2019s friends from the Liberty Union Party and Doris Lake\u2019s husband.\n\nIn the good old days, Diamondstone used to stay over at Sanders\u2019s house in Burlington, and the two men stayed up late shouting political arguments at each other.\n\nOne such row had been over whether all children should be allowed to vote. Diamondstone said yes. Sanders said only after puberty. \u201cI said, \u2018Waddya want, the town clerks to start doing examinations?\u201d Diamondstone remembered yelling.\n\nNow, that was over. Diamondstone staked out a Mondale event. He caught Sanders coming in and handed his friend a leaflet that called him a \u201cQuisling.\u201d\n\nSince then, as Sanders rose through the political ranks, Diamondstone has continued to run as a third-party candidate for state and federal offices. He has run 16 times. He has never won. He has never even cracked 6 percent.\n\n\u201cIt was who we were. I mean, he was the best politician. But I watched how he changed. And those changes seemed to be related to moving to the right\u201d to build a bigger following, Diamondstone said. \u201cI was myself, and he was himself. He became a Democrat. And I stayed where I was.\u201d\n\n\n\nAn old Bernie Sanders poster is seen at the home of Greg Guma in Burlington, Vt. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nSanders served as mayor of Burlington for eight years, leaving office in 1989. Later that year, he and Frank Kochman \u2014 his old publisher, from his threadbare days as a $15-per-story writer \u2014 found themselves alone at a party, looking out over Lake Champlain.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s looking off in the distance, and he says . . . \u2018I think I ought to run for governor or Congress.\u2019 I said, \u2018Bernie, I don\u2019t think that you\u2019ll ever get elected governor,\u2019 \u201d Kochman said.\n\nThe state might not want to be governed by a socialist. But it might send one to Washington. \u201cCongress,\u201d Kochman said. \u201cI think you got a real shot.\u201d\n\nSanders ran, and now it appeared that his courting of the Democrats paid off.\n\nTheir big guns stayed out of the way, apparently assured that Sanders was close enough to being a Democrat already. With the help of the National Rifle Association, which hated the Republican incumbent, Sanders won.\n\nHis association with Democrats continued to pay off.\n\nBy 1991, Sanders \u2014 although still officially an independent \u2014 was part of the Democratic caucus in Congress, climbing the party\u2019s seniority ladder. He has not faced a serious challenge from a Democrat in all the elections since.\n\n\u201cWhy would you run against him, you know what I mean?\u201d said Jeff Weaver, a longtime Sanders staffer and current campaign manager. For Democratic leaders in Congress, he said, Sanders \u201cwas a more reliable vote than a lot of other people down there who had a \u2018D\u2019 after their name.\u201d\n\nBut, in this election, Sanders is running as a Democrat \u2014 officially, fully, within the party system he decried for so long. Sanders said the party\u2019s structure makes it easier to get on ballots, into debates and into the media.\n\nHe has said that if he loses in the Democratic primary, he will not run as an independent.\n\n\u201cHis decision to run this election in the Democratic primary was completely informed by Ralph Nader,\u201d said John Franco, a longtime friend who is a lawyer in Burlington. He said Sanders did not want to draw votes away from a Democrat and elect a Republican in the process, as happened when Nader ran and George W. Bush won in 2000. \u201cThat really turned out swimmingly,\u201d Franco said.\n\nWhat about those on the left who think Sanders has sold out by refusing to go it alone?\n\n\u201cFrankly, those people \u2014 they have their meetings in a phone booth,\u201d Franco said.\n\nOr, at least, in an upstairs meeting room at the Burlington public library.\n\n\n\nAn International Socialist Organization poster in Burlington, Vt. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nThere were 28 people there at the International Socialist Organization meeting Wednesday night. They called one another \u201ccomrade.\u201d They praised Nader for having the guts to challenge the two-party system in 2000. No matter who got elected instead.\n\n\u201cMy first vote was for Ralph Nader,\u201d said Patrick St. John, 32.\n\n\u201cGood for you!\u201d somebody called out, and meant it.\n\nRamey, a forklift operator for a chocolate company, was in charge of answering the question: \u201cShould the Left Support Bernie Sanders?\u201d He listed some of Sanders\u2019s policy goals: a higher minimum wage. Equal pay for women. Free college tuition. A single national health-care system.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to lie. That would be pretty good,\u201d Ramey said.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t good enough, he said, because of Sanders\u2019s choice of tactics: He was running as a Democrat. Which meant that he could lose and deliver his voters to Hillary Clinton, a mainstream Democrat with ties to Wall Street and big business. Deliver them to the system they all wanted to defeat.\n\n\u201cWarts and all, the [Sanders] campaign has a lot going for them,\u201d Ramey said. \u201cBut the Democratic Party is not a wart.\u201d It is a fatal flaw, he said.\n\nSo, if Sanders wasn\u2019t good enough, what should the socialists do? They didn\u2019t settle on a plan. After an hour of discussion, a man in a straw hat stood up.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m tired of being powerless!\u201d said Albert Echt, 66. He wanted to support Bernie Sanders, warts and all. \u201cLet\u2019s jump on Bernie\u2019s coattails. . . . That would actually be doing something, instead of sitting around!\u201d\n\nThe room was not moved. The moderator called on the next person who had raised a hand. Echt, frustrated, walked out.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re such fools!\u201d he told a reporter, in a too-loud whisper, as he left.\n\nThe meeting broke up amicably without him. In the next week, Sanders was planning big rallies in Iowa and Louisiana. The socialists had a plan to meet again on Thursday in Burlington.\n\nAlice Crites contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The fiery independent\u2019s Democratic bid irks socialist purists.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/fahrenthold", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The fiery independent\u2019s Democratic bid irks socialist purists.", "title": "Bernie Sanders is in with the enemy, some old allies say", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/bernie-sanders-says-hes-a-socialist-his-old-socialist-buddies-say-not-so-much/2015/07/25/a3948256-3145-11e5-97ae-30a30cca95d7_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/07/26/Interactivity/Images/crop_mobileDEM_2016_Sanders-0eb74.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@Fahrenthold"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/bernie-sanders-says-hes-a-socialist-his-old-socialist-buddies-say-not-so-much/2015/07/25/a3948256-3145-11e5-97ae-30a30cca95d7_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/fahrenthold"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "eomportal-uuid": "a3948256-3145-11e5-97ae-30a30cca95d7"}, "article_summary": "Greg Guma, who worked with Bernie Sanders and later wrote a book about him, shows off old articles and photos.\nIf Bernie Sanders had a great talent at that time, it was not obvious.\nThis time, they were deciding whether they could support Bernie Sanders himself.\nAnd Bernie Sanders is running for president.\nHe wanted to support Bernie Sanders, warts and all."}
