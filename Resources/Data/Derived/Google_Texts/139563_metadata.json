Definitely a lot of shock still,\" said AMPI employee Alyssa Cotton.\n\nThe fire was contained to a dry storage warehouse. But firefighters from all across the area responded\n\nPortage fire chief Clayton Simonson explained, \"We probably had 25-30 different fire departments here throughout the night to help. We still have one strike team helping us clean up now.\"\n\nMany plant workers were inside when the fire broke out.\n\n\"We were out on the line and we kept hearing people say there's a fire, there's a fire. They went over the loud speaker and said everyone needs to get out now,\" exclaimed Cotton.\n\nThe employees knew what procedures to follow and all acted quickly.\n\n\"We do monthly drills, how to get out quick, where our exits are,\" said Cotton.\n\nThe flames were put out around 6:30 Saturday morning. AMPI has two main goals in the days ahead.\n\n\"A. We can bring our people back and get them back to work as quickly as possible and b. produce products for our customers and fill their needs,\" said AMPI plant manager Donald Weideman.\n\nAs soon as the fire was put out the big job of clean up began. It was important to remove all the cardboard and other materials to prevent a flare up.\n\n\"We called in two bobcats to push all the product out the warehouse door. Then we're dousing that out to put the rest of it out,\" said Simonson.\n\nAfter surveying the damage this morning, the plant manager received good news.\n\n\"All of the production equipment is in very good shape. It's a little dirty and needs to be cleaned up, but that's to be expected when you have a fire,\" said Weideman.\n\nDealing with a fire at any time can be difficult, but employees say they're especially concerned since it's the holidays.\n\n\"With Christmas a couple weeks away we want to get back to work. It's very hard on all of us,\" said Cotton.\n\n\"I expect that we're going to have some people missing a few hours here and there but my goal and plan is to have everybody back to work by next week,\" added Weideman.\n\nThe cause of the fire is still under investigation.\n\nAMPI is asking all employees to not report to work until they're notified by human resources or their work supervisor.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Workers are left to wonder how long they'll be off the floor after a massive fire broke out at a cheese processing plant in Portage.", "language": "english", "author": "Marisa Silvas", "og": {"url": "http://www.nbc15.com/home/headlines/AMPI-cheese-plant-assessing-fire-damage-285730761.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/12-12+cheese+fire+1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Workers are left to wonder how long they'll be off the floor after a massive fire broke out at a cheese processing plant in Portage.", "title": "AMPI cheese plant assessing fire damage"}, "twitter": {"description": "Workers are left to wonder how long they'll be off the floor after a massive fire broke out at a cheese processing plant in Portage.", "title": "AMPI cheese plant assessing fire damage", "url": "http://www.nbc15.com/home/headlines/AMPI-cheese-plant-assessing-fire-damage-285730761.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/12-12+cheese+fire+1.jpg", "creator": "@nbc15_madison", "site": "@nbc15_madison", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "AMPI cheese plant assessing fire damage", "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "nVn1exeOti1r4o5YNXcCBEDU1eFrVztxyWcqAwhz9WA", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "AMPI cheese plant assessing fire"}, "article_summary": "Smoke billowed out of the AMPI cheese plant for hours overnight in Portage.\nAMPI is asking all employees to not report to work until they're notified by human resources or their work supervisor.\nWe can bring our people back and get them back to work as quickly as possible and b. produce products for our customers and fill their needs,\" said AMPI plant manager Donald Weideman.\nThe good news, no one was hurt and the plant shouldn't be out of commission for long.\nAfter surveying the damage this morning, the plant manager received good news."}
