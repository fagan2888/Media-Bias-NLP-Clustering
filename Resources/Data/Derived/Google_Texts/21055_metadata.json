John Hickenlooper on Tuesday issued an executive order outlining land-use subjects that he wants his new task force to address \u2014 from how far oil and gas drilling rigs can be from homes to floodplain restrictions.\n\nThe goal of the 21-member oil and gas task force is to develop recommendations that can be translated into legislation and regulations.\n\nAt the core of the conflict is Colorado\u2019s split estate, where different people can own the surface and the minerals below it.\n\n\u201cThe conflict between subsurface owners and surface owners \u2014 it is in everybody in the state\u2019s interest to find a compromise,\u201d Hickenlooper said. \u201cThis is one of the most important issues I\u2019ve ever worked on.\u201d\n\nThere are 600,000 mineral-interest owners in Colorado, according to the National Association of Royalty Owners.\n\nAmong the items Hickenlooper is asking the panel to review is whether regulations should be adjusted to distinguish among urban, suburban and rural areas.\n\nThe task force will also look at the question of how far drilling rigs should be set back from occupied structures.\n\nThe panel is part of a compromise that removed from the November ballot two oil and gas local control initiatives, backed by U.S Rep. Jared Polis, D-Boulder.\n\nOne ballot measure would have amended the state constitution to mandate a 2,000-foot setback from homes. The state\u2019s current requirement is 500 feet.\n\nHickenlooper, who called the initiatives bad policy, said there was \u201ca communal sigh of relief when we negotiated this commission.\u201d\n\nAmong the other issues outlined in the executive order are air quality, noise abatement, floodplain restrictions and traffic impacts.\n\nA goal, the executive order said, will be \u201cfostering a climate that encourages responsible oil and gas development.\u201d\n\nThe property-rights clash has been heightened by a drilling boom on the Front Range sparked by developments in hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, and horizontal drilling.\n\nThis has enabled oil and gas companies to develop the Niobrara shale, which extends from Denver into Wyoming.\n\n\u201cThis is trying to get at a lot of the emotion around fracking,\u201d Hickenlooper said. \u201cIt isn\u2019t about fracking. It is about oil and gas exploration being too close to where people live.\u201d\n\nThe task force, which will hold public meetings around the state, will make recommendations for legislative changes.\n\n\u201cAs oil and gas drilling, including fracking, continues to expand across the state, the need to address the health and safety concerns of citizens has also expanded,\u201d Jon Goldin-Dubois,a task force member and president of the environmental group Wester Resource Advocates, said in a statement.\n\nHickenlooper said implementation of the group\u2019s recommendations would be a top priority for the coming legislative session.\n\n\u201cTo try and get that done, we\u2019ve set a high bar,\u201d Hickenlooper said. \u201cWe are going to need a two-thirds majority out of this to make a recommendation of any sort.\u201d\n\nThe task force has 19 local and environmental representatives, industry representatives and distinguished Coloradans. It is led by La Plata County Commissioner Gwen Lachelt and XTO Energy president Randy Cleveland.\n\n\u201cThe more perspectives you get on the table, the higher the probability you will get to compromise,\u201d Hickenlooper said.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Hickenlooper: Land-use conflicts over drilling a key Colorado problem", "title": "Hickenlooper: Land-use conflicts over drilling a key Colorado problem", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/09/hickenlooper-land-use-conflicts-over-drilling-a-key-colorado-problem/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140909__CD11FRACKHEALTHDSC_0293p1.jpg", "height": 425}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140909__CD11FRACKHEALTHDSC_0293p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-09T12:36:32+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T08:26:16+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThis is trying to get at a lot of the emotion around fracking,\u201d Hickenlooper said.\nThe goal of the 21-member oil and gas task force is to develop recommendations that can be translated into legislation and regulations.\nThe task force will also look at the question of how far drilling rigs should be set back from occupied structures.\n\u201cThe conflict between subsurface owners and surface owners \u2014 it is in everybody in the state\u2019s interest to find a compromise,\u201d Hickenlooper said.\n\u201cWe are going to need a two-thirds majority out of this to make a recommendation of any sort.\u201dThe task force has 19 local and environmental representatives, industry representatives and distinguished Coloradans."}
