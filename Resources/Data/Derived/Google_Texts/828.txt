Many one-time refugees gathered Friday at Catholic Charities of Dallas to remember where they came from and celebrate where they are now.

The group marked World Refugee Day at its far northeast Dallas headquarters to honor Dallas-area refugees and educate the community on their experiences and challenges.

“This is for outreach, to celebrate their cultures so that they don’t forget where they come from and to show the families the freedom they now have,” said Mohammed Farah, the refugee program manager.

Staff members, some of whom were also refugees, dressed in ethnic clothing, led games, dances and educational programs throughout the day.

The Catholic group, which offers financial assistance, English as a second language lessons, case management and cultural orientation, also held a forum Wednesday where some refugees told their stories.

Miburo Restuta, a mother of five who’s lived in Dallas for two months, shared her experience coming from Burundi through a UNICEF program.

“My kids have been fed well, they have essentials; so far we’ve been taken care of well,” Restuta said through an interpreter. “We are a big family, so we need help until my husband and I can stand on our own feet.”

Around 250 people attended the function this year, much smaller than usual, but Avril Knox, director of refugee services, said the goal of building awareness is still intact.

“A lot of people don’t know the refugees, their experiences and the value they can bring to the community, so they tend to shun them away,” she said. “Once they know who they are, they can be accepting.”
