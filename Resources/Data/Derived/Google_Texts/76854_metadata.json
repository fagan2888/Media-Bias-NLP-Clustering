Previously, Ms. Glen worked as assistant commissioner for housing finance at the city\u2019s Department of Housing Preservation and Development from 1998 to 2002.\n\nAt a news conference announcing her appointment, Mr. de Blasio called her a \u201ca strong and forceful champion for fighting inequality\u201d\n\nFor the de Blasio administration it is perhaps an unusual choice to pluck someone from a high-profile and often-criticized financial institution. But the choice of a woman would diversify the top ranks of his administration.\n\nMs. Glen said, that \u201cthe tale of two cities is not OK. It is not OK for us to live in this city and to tolerate the inequality.\u201d She discussed improving the film, technology, advanced manufacturing and light industrial industries in the city, and \u201cabout making smart, strategic investments to spur job creation.\u201d\n\nMs. Glen said she supports Mr. de Blasio\u2019s plan to tax high-income earners to fund universal pre-kindergarten programs \u2014 and said she believes her colleagues at Goldman would also support it.\n\nShe said she broke down the cost of the plan for someone making $750,000 a year. \u201cI\u2019m a banker so I did the math, and that\u2019s about $3.50 a day, and that\u2019s a latte,\u201d Ms. Glen said.\n\nMs. Glen\u2019s appointment to a prominent post in the nation\u2019s largest city may be a sign the political backlash against Goldman has faded in the years since the financial crisis. Before the crisis, U.S. presidents and other elected officials had turned frequently to Goldman executives to fill out cabinet positions and advisory roles. But the firm\u2019s actions during the crisis drew harsh criticism. Now, as Wall Street\u2019s relationship with Washington improves, Goldman employees with aspirations in government may find the path to their appointment easier.\n\nA number of people in the development community said it is early to tell whether Ms. Glen would prove a good choice because she has little experience in such a high-profile and challenging position.\n\nMr. de Blasio also named Laura Santucci as his chief of staff.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an honor of a lifetime to assume this role,\u201d Ms. Santucci said.\n\nCorrections & Amplifications: Alicia Glen, who New York City Mayor-elect Bill de Blasio appointed as deputy mayor on Monday, Dec. 23, said that Mr. De Blasio\u2019s plan to tax high-income earners in order to fund universal pre-kindergarten would cost someone who makes about $750,000 a year about $3.50 a day. An earlier version of this article incorrectly said that number was $3.57 each day.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Alicia Glen, head of Goldman Sachs\u2019s urban investment group, was appointed deputy mayor for housing and economic development.", "title": "De Blasio Taps Goldman Sachs Executive as Deputy Mayor", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2013/12/23/de-blasio-taps-goldman-sachs-executive-for-deputy-mayor-post/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-AW517_nydebl_G_20131223145739.jpg"}, "site": "WSJNY", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "New York", "article.headline": "De Blasio Taps Goldman Sachs Executive as Deputy Mayor", "description": "Alicia Glen, head of Goldman Sachs\u2019s urban investment group, was appointed deputy mayor for housing and economic development.", "article_section": "New York", "author": "Tom Namako", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Metropolis Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Metropolis", "article.summary": "Alicia Glen, head of Goldman Sachs\u2019s urban investment group, was appointed deputy mayor for housing and economic development.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2013-12-23T17:49:21-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-143", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2013/12/23/de-blasio-taps-goldman-sachs-executive-for-deputy-mayor-post/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-METROB-19423", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "New York", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Alicia Glen, head of Goldman Sachs\u2019s urban investment group, was appointed deputy mayor for housing and economic development.", "title": "De Blasio Taps Goldman Sachs Executive as Deputy Mayor", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2013/12/23/de-blasio-taps-goldman-sachs-executive-for-deputy-mayor-post/", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-AW517_nydebl_G_20131223145739.jpg", "height": 369}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Metropolis", "article.id": "BL-METROB-19423", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2013-12-23T22:28:07-05:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf7fb\"", "article_summary": "At Goldman Sachs, Ms. Glen oversaw the firm\u2019s financing of the Citi Bike program as well as billions of dollars of projects in low-income neighborhoods.\n\u201cI\u2019m a banker so I did the math, and that\u2019s about $3.50 a day, and that\u2019s a latte,\u201d Ms. Glen said.\nBy Laura Kusisto, Justin Baer and Mara GayUPDATED | Alicia Glen, head of Goldman Sachs\u2019s urban investment group, was appointed deputy mayor for housing and economic development.\nMs. Glen said, that \u201cthe tale of two cities is not OK.\nPreviously, Ms. Glen worked as assistant commissioner for housing finance at the city\u2019s Department of Housing Preservation and Development from 1998 to 2002."}
