Barman Sam Barton (above), 22, of Sutton Coldfield, in the West Midlands, was given a nose job by the NHS \u2013 and boasted how easy it was to get the \u00a35,000 procedure\n\nDespite a looming financial crisis, the NHS in 2012/13 found the money to carry out 1,137 facelifts \u2013 costing taxpayers up to \u00a38.5million.\n\nUp to \u00a352.5million went on breast enlargements and a record \u00a310million was spent on liposuction.\n\nEvery week there are now 164 nose jobs, 37 liposuction procedures, 22 facelifts and 273 boob jobs being carried out on the cash-strapped Health Service.\n\nHealth Secretary Jeremy Hunt recently said the NHS should only fund cosmetic surgery when there is a clear clinical need and if someone\u2019s physical and mental health could be at risk without it.\n\nBut the dramatic rise in some forms of surgery indicates that such assurances are not always sought. Surgeons say hospitals are being put under pressure to bend the rules under pressure from patients demanding purely cosmetic work.\n\nEarlier this year a survey found that a quarter of patients who have has cosmetic procedures on the NHS had lied to secure funding. Many claimed to have low self-esteem or depression as a result of the way they looked, according to research by a firm of medical negligence solicitors.\n\nThe figures, from the Health and Social Care Information Centre, do not break down the reasons for the operations \u2013 and whether there was the sort of clinical need that Mr Hunt was talking about.\n\nEarlier this year a survey found that a quarter of patients who have had cosmetic procedures on the NHS had lied to secure funding. Many claimed to have low self-esteem or depression as a result of the way they looked, according to research by a firm of medical negligence solicitors.\n\nFigures obtained by the Mail show the NHS in 2012/13 carried out 1,137 facelifts \u2013 up 111 per cent in a decade. Facelifts cost private patients between \u00a34,000 and \u00a37,500 each, according to the NHS Choices website, meaning that up to \u00a38.5million was spent on the operations in 2012/13.\n\nJosie Cunningham had an enlargement after saying her 32A chest was ruining her life. After becoming unhappy with her new 36DD figure, the Leeds modelling hopeful had a breast reduction on the NHS\n\nThe number of breast enlargements has soared by 145 per cent in a decade to 10,504 \u2013 costing up to \u00a352.5million.\n\nMany of these will be reconstructions following cancer treatment, but the increase far outstrips any rise in breast cancer diagnoses.\n\nIn one case, Josie Cunningham had an enlargement after saying her 32A chest was ruining her life.\n\nAfter becoming unhappy with her resulting 36DD figure, the modelling hopeful from Leeds had a breast reduction on the NHS too.\n\nAnd barman Sam Barton, 22, of Sutton Coldfield, in the West Midlands, was given a nose job by the NHS \u2013 and boasted how easy it was to get the \u00a35,000 procedure.\n\nHe now says he expects the taxpayer to foot the bill for further surgery, including another nose job, as well as having his ears pinned back and jaw reshaped.\n\nThe obesity epidemic has also had an effect on the surgery bill, with the number of liposuction operations in 2012/13 standing at 1,926 \u2013 up 40 per cent in ten years.\n\nThe cost in the most recent year will have been up to \u00a39.6million, according to NHS Choices which says the operation costs between \u00a31,500 and \u00a35,000.\n\nThere has also been a 39 per cent rise in the number undergoing eyelid surgery to 4,966 \u2013 costing up to \u00a319.9million. This operation is supposed to be carried out to treat affected vision.\n\nAnd 8,537 nose jobs were carried out in 2013/14 \u2013 up 4 per cent and costing \u00a334.1million.\n\nJonathan Isaby, of the TaxPayers\u2019 Alliance, said: \u2018It\u2019s ludicrous the NHS pays for procedures that are not based on strict medical needs.\u2019\n\nThe figures were compiled by the Health and Social Care Information Centre, following a request from the Daily Mail.\n\nIt also showed that up to \u00a320.3million was spent on breast reduction operations, \u00a35.8million on tummy tucks and \u00a35.7million on ear pinning. However, these totals have declined over the past decade.\n\nLast month Mr Hunt told a Westminster lunch: \u2018We should not be doing cosmetic work on the NHS.\u2019\n\nRoger Goss, of pressure group Patient Concern, said: \u2018There are two types of cosmetic surgery \u2013 the type that happens after illness and the sort where someone is just trying to look better.\n\n'We agree with the Secretary of State that this kind of thing is no longer affordable on the NHS. In fact, it is amazing it was ever considered affordable at all.\u2019\n\nNHS facing \u00a330bn funding black hole that'll hit 'absolutely vital services' with 'dire' consequences for patients, warns minister\n\nBy JAMES CHAPMAN\n\nHealth minister Norman Lamb has warned of a looming \u00a330billion-a-year black hole in the Health Service\u2019s finances\n\nThe NHS is about to run out of cash and \u2018absolutely vital services\u2019 will have to be slashed unless billions can be saved, a health minister has claimed.\n\nIn a recording obtained by the Daily Mail, Norman Lamb warned of a looming \u00a330billion-a-year black hole in the Health Service\u2019s finances. By 2021, he said, the scale of the funding gap threatens \u2018dire\u2019 consequences for patients.\n\nIt is the first time a minister at the Department for Health has admitted the financial problems facing the NHS.\n\nSpeaking at the Orange Book Conference \u2013 a Liberal Democrat event held last month \u2013 Mr Lamb, minister of state at the Department of Health, said that the NHS faces a \u2018funding gap of \u00a330billion per year\u2019 which austerity measures meant the Government would not be able to fill.\n\n\u2018If you take health\u2026by 2021 if things carry on as they are, there is a funding gap of \u00a330billion, \u00a330billion per year, and so to be in the position to suddenly find vast amounts of extra money to throw at service, and given the state of public finances and indeed the changing ratio of people of working age to people who aren\u2019t, quite dramatic in our society, that seems to be an unlikely prospect,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018The potential consequences of the status quo are that across the country you lose absolutely vital services which people rely on, and for me the consequences of that are too dire to contemplate.\n\n\u2018So there is an absolute imperative that we think about how we get a better value from public services.\u2019\n\nNHS England has warned that within the next few years the service is \u2018about to run out of cash in a very serious fashion\u2019.\n\nHealth Secretary Jeremy Hunt denied there is any existing black hole in the NHS, and insisted the Government is making savings to contend with increasing demand for services.\n\nHealth Secretary Jeremy Hunt denied there is any existing black hole in the NHS, and insisted the Government is making savings to contend with increasing demand for services\n\nAsked if he would have to request a bailout from Chancellor George Osborne, Mr Hunt told Radio 4\u2019s Today: \u2018No, and I think it is wrong to describe it as a black hole.\n\n\u2018Every year, because of an ageing population, we have additional demand for services and we have to make efficiency savings. Over this Parliament, we have found about \u00a320billion of efficiency savings which we are investing in more doctors and nurses on the front line.\n\n\u2018And every year we have a challenge in the NHS to find those efficiency savings.\n\n\u2018We have had a very difficult few years as a country but every family up and down the country has learned to live within its budget, and we too must live within our budget in the NHS. We are doing that and I\u2019m sure we will continue to do that.\u2019\n\nSome members of Labour\u2019s Shadow Cabinet want the party to commit to increasing National Insurance by a penny to pay for extra NHS spending.\n\nThe rise would replicate Gordon Brown\u2019s 1 per cent rise, which was introduced in the 2002 Budget to increase investment in the Health Service.\n\nDavid Cameron told MPs this week that for the first time, the independent Commonwealth Fund had ranked the UK\u2019s Health Service as the best in the world.\n\n\u2018It has happened only under this Government,\u2019 he said.\n\nBut Shadow Cabinet Office minister Jonathan Ashworth said: \u2018You can\u2019t trust the Tories with the NHS.", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "news_keywords": "NHS,blows,millions,boob,jobs,facelifts,Taxpayers,foot,bill,cosmetic,surgery,doubles,ten,years", "original-source": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2681287/NHS-blows-millions-boob-jobs-facelifts-Taxpayers-foot-bill-cosmetic-surgery-doubles-ten-years.html", "doc-class": "Living Document", "twitter": {"description": "Despite a looming financial crisis, the NHS in 2012/13 found the money to carry out 1,137 facelifts \u2013 costing taxpayers up to \u00a38.5million.", "title": "NHS blows millions on boob jobs and facelifts", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2681287/NHS-blows-millions-boob-jobs-facelifts-Taxpayers-foot-bill-cosmetic-surgery-doubles-ten-years.html", "app": {"id": {"ipad": 400442503, "iphone": 384101264}}, "image": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/07/05/1404518619516_wps_10_rising_number_of_operatio.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "account_id": 15438913}, "robots": "noodp,noydir,all,noarchive", "al": {"android": {"url": "dailymail-fb://article/2681287/", "app_name": "Daily Mail Online", "package": "com.dailymail.online"}, "ios": {"url": "dailymail-fb://article/2681287/", "app_store_id": 384101264, "app_name": "MailOnline"}}, "msvalidate.01": "12E6B4B813EB44C9BFC8F6A21F1D01F5", "fb": {"app_id": 146202712090395}, "MSSmartTagsPreventParsing": "true", "articleid": 2681287, "divclasspage": "articlePage", "keywords": "NHS,blows,millions,boob,jobs,facelifts,Taxpayers,foot,bill,cosmetic,surgery,doubles,ten,years", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMail", "published_time": "2014-07-05T00:07:43.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "author": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/search.html?s=&authornamef=Daniel+Martin+for+the+Daily+Mail", "section": "News", "modified_time": "2014-07-09T15:10:38.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "tag": "NHS blows millions boob jobs facelifts Taxpayers foot bill cosmetic surgery doubles ten years"}, "verify-v1": "DXwlrsxbqxSv+FTFkWUfgflBvFJfx2YbNf/HmABrVyY=", "y_key": "1a7e912afbfcab2f", "og": {"site_name": "Mail Online", "description": "Despite a looming financial crisis, the NHS in 2012/13 found the money to carry out 1,137 facelifts \u2013 costing taxpayers up to \u00a38.5million.", "title": "NHS blows millions on boob jobs and facelifts", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2681287/NHS-blows-millions-boob-jobs-facelifts-Taxpayers-foot-bill-cosmetic-surgery-doubles-ten-years.html", "image": {"width": 636, "identifier": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/07/05/1404518619516_wps_10_rising_number_of_operatio.jpg", "height": 382}, "type": "article"}, "channel": "News", "description": "Despite a looming financial crisis, the NHS in 2012/13 found the money to carry out 1,137 facelifts \u2013 costing taxpayers up to \u00a38.5million."}, "article_summary": "Tens of millions of pounds are being spent every year by the NHS on cosmetic surgery, figures reveal.\nEvery week there are now 164 nose jobs, 37 liposuction procedures, 22 facelifts and 273 boob jobs being carried out on the cash-strapped Health Service.\nIn a recording obtained by the Daily Mail, Norman Lamb warned of a looming \u00a330billion-a-year black hole in the Health Service\u2019s finances.\nThere has also been a 39 per cent rise in the number undergoing eyelid surgery to 4,966 \u2013 costing up to \u00a319.9million.\nThe rise would replicate Gordon Brown\u2019s 1 per cent rise, which was introduced in the 2002 Budget to increase investment in the Health Service."}
