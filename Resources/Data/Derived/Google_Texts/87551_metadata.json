Recently, his main focus has been the \"Stop the Violence\" campaign to end gun violence in Milwaukee and Chicago.\n\nEarlier this month, he walked from Milwaukee to Chicago to raise awareness of gun violence. The 100-mile walk took him five days and on Saturday, Aug. 8 he arrived in Chicago. Upon his arrival he wrote the following on his Facebook page:\n\n\"Along the way I stopped and spoke to the residents. Many gave their solutions to the problem and we all had the same conclusion. Many said that we need all new leaders who will fight for jobs, better education and invest back into our youth. We need to restore the broken home structure and reshape how we look at our community when it come to loving our neighbors. Discipline starts at home.\"\n\nTory Lowe is a homegrown social justice crusader and a straight-up Milwaukee All-Star.\n\nOnMilwaukee.com / Too Much Metal: How long have you worked at this?\n\nTory Lowe: I got back home in February 2011.
