Some political experts said Clinton\u2019s comments appeared to be part of a larger, ongoing effort to shore up support in her party\u2019s liberal base, where her chief rival, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, has been gaining ground.\n\n\u201cThis is very much a primary issue. It\u2019s not a general election issue,\u201d said Jack Pitney, a professor of political science at Claremont McKenna College.\n\n\u201cI seriously doubt she\u2019ll be running ads on this issue in October of next year\u201d if she wins the Democratic nomination, he said of Clinton.\n\nSIGN UP for the free Essential Politics newsletter >>\n\nPitney also said Clinton might be trying to gain support outside of her African American and white base. \u201cIf she can build a firewall among Hispanic voters, then it would be very hard to deny her the nomination,\u201d he said.\n\nRandy Capps, director of research for U.S. programs at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute, noted how different things were in conversations among Republicans, with candidates proposing such things as abolishing birthright citizenship and building a wall between the U.S. and Mexico.\n\n\u201cCertainly it sets the stage for this issue being part of the debate in the general election, where there will be a huge contrast between whoever the Democratic nominee is and whoever the Republican nominee is,\u201d he said.\n\nResponding to a question during the Las Vegas debate on Tuesday, Clinton generally endorsed California\u2019s approach.\n\nIn June, Gov. Jerry Brown signed a budget that for the first time funds healthcare for children in the country illegally, making California the largest state to do so. In addition, the number of counties in the state that have committed to providing low-cost, government-run medical care to such residents jumped from 11 to 48 this year.\n\nSome California legislators have vowed to continue expanding coverage until everyone has insurance. State Sen. Ricardo Lara (D-Bell Gardens) has introduced a bill that would allow unauthorized immigrants to purchase a medical plan through the state\u2019s Obamacare exchange and let poorer immigrants sign up for the state\u2019s low-income health program, known as Medi-Cal.\n\nLara called Clinton\u2019s comments a \u201cparadigm shift,\u201d noting how quickly California\u2019s approach entered the national political conversation.\n\n\u201cWhen I began the push for health for all, I was often told that my vision was too ambitious and needed to take a more incremental approach,\u201d he said. \u201cWith national Democratic candidates taking note of what we\u2019re doing in California, I\u2019m confident that public support will continue to grow across the country.\u201d\n\nLara and other advocates say it\u2019s smart to provide coverage to unauthorized immigrants, because they often end up in emergency rooms, racking up bigger bills than if they\u2019d received routine medical care earlier.\n\nCritics say actions like those being taken in California on healthcare are exacerbating the problem of people coming to the U.S. illegally.\n\nFederation for American Immigration Reform spokesman Ira Mehlman cited a 2009 Congressional Budget Office report that found expansion of preventive care generally leads to higher, not lower, spending.\n\nIn California, some proposals to extend healthcare to people who lack legal status have been priced at more than $1 billion. \u201cIt seems that sometimes they stay up late there in Sacramento dreaming up new benefits and services and protections they can provide to people who are in the country illegally even as they\u2019re cutting all kinds of things to everybody else,\u201d Mehlman said.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, legal residents, depending on their income, can either buy insurance through new Obamacare exchanges using government-provided subsidies, or they can sign up for coverage through Medicaid, the federal health program for the poor.\n\nSanders has expressed broad support for extending heath coverage to people here illegally, calling it a fundamental right. Approximately 36 million U.S. residents are uninsured, 6 million of whom are here illegally, according to data from Gallup and the Migration Policy Institute.\n\nFormer Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley, also running for the Democratic nomination, has proposed allowing approximately 5 million immigrants who are eligible for temporary immunity from deportation to either take advantage of government subsidies and purchase medical coverage through the insurance exchanges or sign up for Medicaid programs.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Hillary Clinton just backed healthcare for immigrants in the U.S. illegally", "Description": "Over the last year, California politicians have been blazing a trail many doubted the rest of the country would follow: offering free healthcare to hundreds of thousands of people in the country illegally.But on Tuesday, presidential front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton took a stance on the contentious...", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "Over the last year, California politicians have been blazing a trail many doubted the rest of the country would follow: offering free healthcare to hundreds of thousands of people in the country illegally.", "title": "Hillary Clinton just backed healthcare for immigrants in the U.S. illegally", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-pc-clinton-democratic-debate-undocumented-immigrant-healthcare-20151013-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561e75ee/turbine/la-me-pc-clinton-democratic-debate-undocumented-immigrant-healthcare-20151013", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp12.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/84703108", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2015-10-14", "y_key": "cee2fe4077f8d050", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "googlebot": "index"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe4edd\"", "article_summary": "Jerry Brown signed a budget that for the first time funds healthcare for children in the country illegally, making California the largest state to do so.\nCritics say actions like those being taken in California on healthcare are exacerbating the problem of people coming to the U.S. illegally.\nClinton said she favored efforts by states such as California to extend health benefits to these immigrants.\n\u201cFirst of all, I want to make sure every child gets healthcare ... and I want to support states that are expanding healthcare and including undocumented children and others,\u201d Clinton said.\nOver the last year, California politicians have been blazing a trail many doubted the rest of the country would follow: offering free healthcare to hundreds of thousands of people in the country illegally."}
