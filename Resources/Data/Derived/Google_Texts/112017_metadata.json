Will the American protectorate in place for 70 years hold, they ask in Tokyo, in Seoul, in Manila, and now even in Hanoi.\n\nThe short but unqualified answer is, \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nChina\u2019s emergence is a matter of history, of geography, and, since Deng opened the reform period in 1978, of accumulated economic power. Behind the rise we witness now lie Beijing\u2019s view that the post 1945 order in the western Pacific must be corrected and a fulsome measure of Middle Kingdom determination. In one of the world\u2019s wounded civilizations, the recovery of lost greatness has been the national dream since Mao took Beijing in 1949.\n\nDoes the Obama administration grasp any of this? This has not been clear for some time and grows more questionable now.\n\nLast Saturday, Reuters reported the U.S. issued one of its strongest warnings to China when Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel told an Asia-Pacific conference that the U.S. \u201cwill not look the other way when fundamental principles of the international order are being challenged.\u201d\n\nRelated: U.S. Warns China Against Aggression as Allies Seek More Cooperation\n\nHagel said the United States took no position on the merits of rival territorial claims in the region, but added, \"We firmly oppose any nation\u2019s use of intimidation, coercion, or the threat of force to assert these claims.\"\n\nThe posture here is not right. The primary lesson to be grasped in Washington and the Asian capitals is that the less time spent with fingers in the dike the better. The task now is to devise sensible, imaginative, sustainable policy responses that protect the interests of the U.S. and its allies while altering the climate in Asia from the poisonous antagonism we have to accommodation and on to cooperation.\n\nRelated: Legacy at Risk, Obama Struggles to Redefine Foreign Policy\n\nThis can be done, providing the wit and guts are there.\n\nRecommendation No. 1 for Washington: Cut out the political appointees game in the foreign service. Restore the State Department\u2019s institutional memory with good brains versed in history, the languages, and culture as opposed to rational choice theory.\n\nRecommendation No. 2: Take control of the policy process away from Defense and the military and give it back to State, thus correcting an error that has for decades been detrimental to U.S. interests and the American profile in Asia.\n\nThe moment to rebuild strategy, ground up, is upon us for a simple reason: China has chosen it. Beijing has for many years waited for the right occasion to assert itself with concrete actions. As our jargon has it, China is \u201ccalling us out.\u201d\n\nThere is not much ambiguity on this point. China has been increasingly aggressive in asserting its position in an islands dispute with Japan since last year. Six months ago came its declaration of an air defense zone that intersects with those Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan have had in place, courtesy of American cartographers, since the early Cold War years.\n\nMore recently Beijing has advanced maritime claims in the South China Sea that place its rights within a few dozen miles of the Philippines shoreline and 300 miles from the mainland. In its boldest moves to date, it recently towed an oilrig into waters claimed by Vietnam, prompting protests in Hanoi that resulted in four deaths.\n\nRelated: The Gas Deal with China Could Bail Out Mother Russia\n\nThese are not separate questions. They are better understood as the start of China\u2019s campaign to renovate the power balance in the western Pacific. David Pilling, Asia editor at the Financial Times, sees savvy tactical design as a unifying theme across the region. \u201cChina\u2019s probing the edge of what it can do,\u201d Pilling said the other day. \u201cThese are issues Beijing knows America will not react to other than rhetorically.\u201d\n\nPilling, who is among the most astute Asia analysts now in the field, takes a very long view of Chinese thinking. China turned inward after the 1949 revolution, he says, finding Washington\u2019s Pax Pacifica objectionable but expedient. So did Deng, who said in effect, \u201cLet\u2019s proceed with our reforms and choose our moment carefully.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome people took acquiescence in the post-1945 order to be permanent policy, but it\u2019s a misreading,\u201d Pilling said. \u201cIf one is to take one\u2019s time, the only question left is, \u201cWhen?\u201d And it now starts to look as if the answer is, \u201cNow.\u201d\n\nO.K., Pilling, but why now?\n\nThe 2008 financial crisis was a tripwire, in Pilling\u2019s view. America no longer appeared infallible; China, as America\u2019s biggest banker, a WTO member, and ahead of Japan as the No. 2 economic power, gained confidence. \u201cThere\u2019s a prestige factor here, too,\u201d Pilling added.\n\nRelated: U.S. and China in a Lethal Game of Cyber Chess\n\nEqually, the Law of the Sea had long been on the U.N.\u2019s docket, but only recently have nations marked out formal territorial claims. When Hillary Clinton, then Secretary of State, asserted America\u2019s role in protecting Asian sea lanes on a visit to Hanoi in 2010, Beijing\u2019s back stiffened. \u201cCritical point,\u201d Pilling thinks. \u201cChina saw no role for America in Asian disputes. What if relations with the referee turned hostile?\u201d\n\nAt the security conference in Singapore at the end of last week, the shared concern among Hagel and his counterparts was the pressure Beijing now intentionally exerts to weaken Washington\u2019s network of alliances with regional capitals. This is almost certainly an accurate perception.\n\nYet, it would be a mistake to assume China intends to replace Pax Americana with a Pax Sinica. It is too busy at home, cannot afford any such an ambition, and has proven from Mao to Deng and since that pragmatic self-interest figures high in its calculations. This is the door to renovated relations Washington must not fail to step through.\n\nHagel\u2019s criticism of Beijing\u2019s recent moves in the region\u2014\u201cintimidation and coercion,\u201d he said\u2014was a mistake on numerous counts. First, it was Hagel\u2019s remark. The defense secretary should do less traveling in Asia and Secretary Kerry more. Second, Hagel betrayed anxiety, and one must avoid that with the Chinese. Third, he signaled that Washington remains determined to fight the forlorn fight against the incoming tide.\n\nFinally, Hagel elicited two reactions in the region, neither desirable. Beijing denounced the conference point blank. Elsewhere, Hagel\u2019s talk will merely confirm the widely shared impression that talk is all Washington finally has on offer.\n\nAsia Sentinel, an authoritative online journal published in Hong Kong, said it this way in a recent edition: \u201cFor a nation that is supposedly paying more attention to Asia and building relationships with old and new friends, the U.S. response to recent Chinese moves against Vietnam and the Philippines has been mealy-mouthed.\u201d\n\nNot the desired effect, to put the point mildly.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The Chinese dragon, awake and alert for some time, is suddenly stretching its arms and", "title": "China\u2019s Strategy Has Completely Eluded Washington", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2014/06/02/China-s-Strategy-Has-Completely-Eluded-Washington", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03262012_USA_vs_China_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2014/06/02/China-s-Strategy-Has-Completely-Eluded-Washington", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03262012_USA_vs_China_article.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@psmith7600"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "The Chinese dragon, awake and alert for some time, is suddenly stretching its arms and", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2be2\"", "article_summary": "David Pilling, Asia editor at the Financial Times, sees savvy tactical design as a unifying theme across the region.\nThe defense secretary should do less traveling in Asia and Secretary Kerry more.\n\u201cCritical point,\u201d Pilling thinks.\nElsewhere, Hagel\u2019s talk will merely confirm the widely shared impression that talk is all Washington finally has on offer.\nThey are better understood as the start of China\u2019s campaign to renovate the power balance in the western Pacific."}
