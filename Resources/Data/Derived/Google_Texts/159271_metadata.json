This number is up significantly from 225 counties with just one insurer on the exchanges in 2016, and it could continue to grow, according to the report. The latest figures won't be available until all state filings have been made public in September.\n\nAlaska and Alabama are the hardest hit states, in which no county will have more than one insurer on the exchanges. Other states with fewer options for rural residents include Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi, Arizona and Oklahoma, according to the report. Data from Inovalon cited in the report indicates insurers may be rapidly pulling out of the exchanges for rural areas because costs are higher there. The patients tend to be sicker and provider costs also tend to be higher, according to the report.\n\nAs of now, every county will likely have at least one option on the exchange, a federal official from HHS told The Wall Street Journal.\n\nRead the full report here.\n\nMore articles on payer issues:\n\nWellmark to raise rates at least 38% for some Iowa customers\n\nMedica, Aetna plan to sell coverage in Kansas\n\n6 things to know about non-embedded deductibles\n\n\u00a9 Copyright ASC COMMUNICATIONS 2016.
