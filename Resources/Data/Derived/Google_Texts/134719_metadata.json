The state is Virginia, which is inching toward becoming a Democratic-leaning outpost. With both, there are caveats.\n\nMr. Christie was a big winner; some consider him a clear favorite for the 2016 presidential nomination and even the de facto leader of his besieged and divided party.\n\nThe recently published, headline-grabbing book on the 2012 election, \u201cDouble Down: Game Change 2012,\u201d by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann, provides an insightful critique of the 51-year-old New Jersey Republican. He is smart, tough, empathetic, confident and arrogant. Wall Street billionaires, many of whom don\u2019t give a whit about cultural or social issues, melt into a drooling man-crush around the take-no-prisoners Mr. Christie.\n\nThere also are yellow lights. Mitt Romney\u2019s camp leaked the information they gathered while vetting Mr. Christie as a possible running mate on the Republican presidential ticket in 2012. It allegedly contained questionable billing, dubious relationships and dealings, and temperamental concerns. \u201cIf Christie had been in the nomination fight against us we would have destroyed him,\u201d Mr. Romney\u2019s advisers concluded, according to the authors.\n\nThen there\u2019s the question of how the brash, in-your-face Jersey style will play in the Midwest or the South. Conservative Republicans question Mr. Christie\u2019s bona fides on immigration, climate change and guns, and they resent his failure to hate President Obama. Tax activist Grover Norquist predicts a softness on gun control will be especially troublesome for Christie.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAs Mr. Christie tries to assuage conservatives who form the base of the party, he risks losing his calling card: straight-talking authenticity.\n\nStill, even though the old-line Republican establishment may be in eclipse, it has been a long time since they had a candidate as formidable this early.\n\nMany Republicans say they lost the Virginia gubernatorial race because their candidate, state Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli, was flawed. True, but the Democratic victor, Terry McAuliffe, is from New York, has been a wheeler-dealer in money and politics for decades, and has failed to deliver on a promise he made that a company he controlled would create jobs in Virginia.\n\nMore instructive, if somewhat muddled, are the Election Day exit polls. The electorate was 72 percent white, down from 78 percent four years earlier. Even if the black turnout was slightly exaggerated, the demographics of Virginia are changing. That\u2019s bad for Republicans.\n\nYoung voters represented 13 percent of the electorate this time, up from 10 percent four years ago. Mr. McAuliffe won this group by five points, much less than Mr. Obama\u2019s 25-point margin in the presidential contest. A third-party, libertarian candidate did best with this demographic, getting 15 percent; he espoused tolerance and keeping the government out of people\u2019s personal lives \u2014 views many Republicans reject.\n\nThe exit polls also cast doubt on Republicans\u2019 claims that they almost won the race because of the unpopularity of the Affordable Care Act. By a slight margin, Obamacare was viewed negatively by voters this year, a result that is virtually unchanged from 2012 exit polls in the state.\n\nGeoff Garin, a McAuliffe campaign poll-taker, said the controversial measure actually helped his candidate. \u201cMedicaid expansion is part of Obamacare, and Cuccinelli\u2019s opposition to that was an important part of the appeal to voters we targeted,\u201d he said.\n\nAll things being equal, though they probably won\u2019t be, color Virginia slightly blue going into 2016.\n\nThere\u2019s no cause for cockiness. Democrats expected to do better with white, working-class Virginians based on the idea that race may have played a role in Mr. Obama\u2019s miserable showing with that group. Yet white, working-class men voted overwhelmingly for Mr. Cuccinelli; southwest Virginia, a stronghold of these voters, went as decisively Republican as last time.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of work to start getting votes of working-class whites,\u201d Mr. Garin said.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20131110123031, "twitter": {"description": "The elections last week highlighted the rise of Gov.
