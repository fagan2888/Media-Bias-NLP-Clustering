In the aftermath of the Supreme Court decision on the Defense of Marriage Act in June, Lappin said the couple intends to file jointly next year and may revisit the idea of family coverage.\n\n\u201cI believe the rates are the same if we buy individually or together, so it\u2019s just sending two checks versus one check,\u201d Lappin said. \u201cBut I will definitely revisit that once we have joint tax returns and make sure.\u201d\n\nThe couple enjoys a positive outcome under health care reform as President Obama makes a renewed push for the law, saying problems with the enrollment website are fixed and healthcare.gov is now working for the vast majority of people.\n\nDuring an event at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building on Tuesday, Obama touted his signature legislation in front of 19 people who also had positive experiences under health care reform.\n\n\u201cNow that we are getting the technology fixed \u2014 we need you to go back, take a look at what\u2019s actually going on, because it can make a difference in your lives and the lives of your families,\u201d Obama said. \u201cAnd maybe it won\u2019t make a difference right now if you\u2019re feeling healthy, but I promise you, if somebody in your family \u2014 heaven forbid \u2014 gets sick, you\u2019ll see the difference.\u201d\n\nAs a result of the law, Obama projected that half a million people are poised to gain health care coverage through the health insurance exchanges and the Medicaid expansion beginning on Jan. 1 \u2014 some for the very first time.\n\nRea Carey, executive director of the National Gay & Lesbian Task Force, expressed solidarity with Obama in a statement the next day, saying his law is a \u201cgiant step\u201d toward delivering health care to all Americans.\n\n\u201cWe stand with the president in his unshakable commitment to this fundamental component of a transformed society,\u201d Carey said. \u201cWe also encourage everyone to fully educate themselves on how to access the benefits of the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nUpon the initial rollout of healthcare.gov, users reportedly faced numerous problems, including loading difficulties and error messages. Lappin said he and his partner initially had difficulties enrolling via the website, but eventually were able to apply.\n\n\u201cWhen I would get in, it was glitchy, but over the next probably two weeks or so, I continued to get better and I was able to get in, and get it figured out,\u201d Lappin said.\n\nAs he\u2019s gone back to healthcare.gov to make payments and obtain confirmation from HUMANA, his new insurance company, Lappin noticed an increase in the website\u2019s functionality.\n\n\u201cI log back in now and the site seems to work,\u201d Lappin said. \u201cIt\u2019s much faster, much quicker, the buttons actually work and do things now. As somebody who\u2019s started Oct. 1 through now, I can tell you, huge improvements to the site.\u201d\n\nLappin said he and his spouse opted to apply for health insurance through healthcare.gov, the website for the federal exchange, because Georgia doesn\u2019t offer its own state insurance exchange and has no website for enrollment.\n\nLGBT advocates \u2014 and the Obama administration \u2014 have touted that health care reform provides non-discrimination protections for LGBT people in the health care system. Through regulation, the Obama administration has interpreted the gender protections under the law to apply to sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\nAlthough he\u2019s claiming significant savings under Obamacare, Lappin said he doesn\u2019t think that\u2019s because of discrimination faced under the previous system.\n\n\u201cWe had individual plans, so I don\u2019t think there was any way that anybody could have discriminated against us,\u201d Lappin said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t even come up in any kind of underwriting, anything that we know about.\u201d\n\nMara Keisling, executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality, praised the non-discrimination protections as essential for trans people seeking health coverage.\n\n\u201cAn important message to get out is that trans people and people living with HIV/AIDS can no longer be denied as having pre-existing conditions,\u201d Keisling said.\n\nKeisling said her own organization has benefited under Obamacare, saving about $250 per staff person per month on health insurance costs, or about $15,000 total.\n\nDespite the push to promote Obamacare, most Republicans remain opposed to the law and continue hammering the administration for problems that have emerged since the rollout.\n\nAlso in this camp is the Log Cabin Republicans, which previously joined with conservative groups in signing a letter calling health care reform \u201ctyrannical.\u201d\n\nGregory Angelo, executive director of Log Cabin Republicans, said he\u2019s heard horror stories from members about their efforts at enrolling in healthcare.gov.\n\n\u201cPremiums are going up, some members have had no luck signing up on the website even after making repeated good faith efforts, people have been unable to change their information after it has been entered and connected with their Social Security number,\u201d Angelo said.\n\nAngelo said he couldn\u2019t find a member willing to speak publicly about the problems.\n\nFor his part, Obama said during the White House event he\u2019s open to ideas about changing the law, but won\u2019t go back to the way things were before his health care reform was in place.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always said I will work with anybody to implement and improve this law effectively,\u201d Obama said. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got good ideas, bring them to me. Let\u2019s go. But we\u2019re not repealing it as long as I\u2019m president.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Amid media reports over technical difficulties with the website, cancelled policies and loss of registration information for enrollment, the Atlanta, Ga., couple, represents the side of Obamacare that has proven to be a success in the month since the law has gone into effect.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Blade: Gay News, Politics, LGBT Rights", "description": "Amid media reports over technical difficulties with the website, cancelled policies and loss of registration information for enrollment, the Atlanta, Ga., couple, represents the side of Obamacare that has proven to be a success in the month since the law has gone into effect.", "title": "Obama renews PR push for health care law", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 404, "identifier": "http://www.washingtonblade.com/content/files/2013/12/John_West_and_Michael_Lappin_thumb_courtesy_Michael_Lappin.jpg", "height": 404}, "updated_time": "2013-12-04T17:07:32-04:00", "url": "http://www.washingtonblade.com/2013/12/04/lgbt-experience-obamacare/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Amid media reports over technical difficulties with the website, cancelled policies and loss of registration information for enrollment, the Atlanta, Ga., couple, represents the side of Obamacare that has proven to be a success in the month since the law has gone into effect.", "creator": "@chrisjohnson82", "image": "http://www.washingtonblade.com/content/files/2013/12/John_West_and_Michael_Lappin_thumb_courtesy_Michael_Lappin.jpg", "title": "Obama renews PR push for health care law", "site": "@WashBlade", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 13357499221}, "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/WashingtonBlade", "section": "News", "tag": "Rea Carey", "published_time": "2013-12-04T14:31:56-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-12-04T17:07:32-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "news_keywords": "gay news, Washington Blade, Obamacare, gay health insurance"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8e2f\"", "article_summary": "LGBT advocates \u2014 and the Obama administration \u2014 have touted that health care reform provides non-discrimination protections for LGBT people in the health care system.\nDuring an event at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building on Tuesday, Obama touted his signature legislation in front of 19 people who also had positive experiences under health care reform.\nKeisling said her own organization has benefited under Obamacare, saving about $250 per staff person per month on health insurance costs, or about $15,000 total.\nFor his part, Obama said during the White House event he\u2019s open to ideas about changing the law, but won\u2019t go back to the way things were before his health care reform was in place.\n\u201cI\u2019ve always said I will work with anybody to implement and improve this law effectively,\u201d Obama said."}
