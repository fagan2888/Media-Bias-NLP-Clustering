1. Finding a family doctor takes forever

And then you end up on a wait list for two years.

2. Specialists and hospitals don't talk

Which means your specialist might send you to a hospital with a long wait time instead of one with a short one.

3. Hospital parking is SO EXPENSIVE

And nobody makes change inside.

4. Doctors are too busy

And it always feels like they're rushing you out the door.

5. Friends with doctors in the family get better service

They magically get appointments in two weeks instead of eight months.

6. We have to pay for drugs/dentists/vision care

But we always forget and end up forgoing care or emptying the wallet.

7. And don't get us started on mental health coverage

Which often isn't covered either.

8. Family doctors insist you can't use walk-in clinics

Because they lose money every time you do. Why is the pay structure like this again?

9. Preventative care takes a backseat

Even though it could help us save money.

10. Moving provinces is a nightmare

We're supposed to have universal health care, but good luck figuring out the paperwork to get reimbursed for out-of-province care.

11. It costs money to get a sick note

Why do we pay for you to scribble gibberish on a notepad? Feels like a hidden fee.

12. And to renew prescriptions over the phone

Now I'm going to the office for no good reason. But the doctor will get paid, so the system will lose money on the transaction. Genius!

13. Doctors STILL HAVEN'T GONE DIGITAL

Even after the eHealth scandal in Ontario.

Seriously, do they just hate computers?

But even though things aren't perfect

At least we'll always be better than them
