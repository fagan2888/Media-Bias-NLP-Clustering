An older brother entered the scene, barking, \u201cWhat\u2019re you guys listening to? This stuff\u2019s for kids!\u201d My friend, who, it should be noted, was quite stoned, retorted, \u201cNo! It says right here\u2014\u2018not\u2019 for kids only.\u2019 \u201d\n\nI thought of my old buddy, bless his heart, when I learned of the D.C. Circuit\u2019s ruling\u2014its \u201cringing affirmation \u2026 of the rule of law,\u201d according to the reliably florid Charles C.W. Cooke\u2014on Obamacare\u2019s insurance-exchange subsidies.\n\nThe right\u2019s chortling reaction, in sum: It says right here \u2014 \u201cExchanges established by the State\u201d!\n\nI\u2019d sincerely like to imagine that Cato\u2019s Michael Cannon was stoned when he discovered this quirk in the text of the Affordable Care Act. But I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s a lot easier to imagine the pinkie ring and prideful guffawing of Mike Myers\u2019s Dr. Evil.\n\nI didn\u2019t think \u201cThey\u2019re going to make you buy broccoli next\u201d could be topped.\n\nOh, was I wrong.\n\nThe two judges who comprised a majority of the D.C. Circuit panel argued that the government failed to provide evidence that the authors of the law did not intend to funnel subsidies through state exchanges only. Well, why would such evidence exist\u2014if, as seems exceedingly likely, it never occurred to anyone that the subsidies were so structured until Cannon announced his discovery? \u201cIt was a carrot dangled in front of states, just like the promise of more Medicaid money,\u201d the plaintiffs speculated. If so, then why the backstop of a federal exchange? What\u2019s the point of the thing if not to convey subsidies to eligible customers? Much to the dismay of supporters of the ACA, there was no Plan B after the Supreme Court allowed states to opt out of the Medicaid expansion. And so the money remains unspent.\n\nThere\u2019s no getting around the fact that those who drafted the law are guilty of a linguistic oversight. In a sane world, the matter would have been dispatched through a technical corrections bill, much as President Clinton and Congress ironed out a kink in U.S. Code that granted citizenship to those born abroad and one of whose parents was a U.S. citizen. Before the correction, the government granted citizenship only to those whose fathers were citizens.\n\nBut we\u2019re not living in a sane world right now. We\u2019re living in the world of massive resistance.\n\nDon\u2019t misunderstand. I\u2019m hardly a fan of Obamacare. I\u2019m with those who champion a cheaper and cleaner method of achieving universal coverage. I suppose it could be argued that the Halbig case is one way of getting there. But when its mastermind heads the \u201cAnti-Universal Coverage Club,\u201d I kind of doubt it.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The American Conservative", "description": "Decades ago, a few friends and I were listening to Not For Kids Only, an album of Appalachian folk songs recorded for charity by Jerry Garcia and David Gris", "title": "Obamacare vs. Dr. Evil\u2019s Legal Eagles", "url": "http://www.theamericanconservative.com/2014/07/23/obamacare-vs-dr-evils-legal-eagles/", "image": "http://theamericanconservative.com/images/facebook-logo.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Decades ago, a few friends and I were listening to Not For Kids Only, an album of Appalachian folk songs recorded for charity by Jerry Garcia and David Grisman.
