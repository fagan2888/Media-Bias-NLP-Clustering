Nor are New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, U.S. Atty. Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr., President Obama or any of the protesters and activists they supported, encouraged and allied themselves with. Going by what we know, the only person to blame is the man police identified as the killer, Ismaaiyl Brinsley.\n\nThis is the standard I've upheld in this space for years, when one madmen after another has killed and maimed in the name of one cause or another. It's also been necessary to uphold this standard when madmen have killed for no political cause whatsoever, but politicians and journalists have been determined to claim otherwise.\n\n\n\nThe most glaring example of this was the horrible 2011 shooting spree in Tucson that claimed six lives and horribly wounded then-U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. The shooting occurred during a period of maximum liberal paranoia about the tea party movement. And in a riot of groupthink, much of the elite media convinced itself \u2014 absent any evidence \u2014 that the killer, Jared Loughner, was inspired by, variously, Sarah Palin's Facebook map of congressional races (there were targets over various districts where Palin wanted Democrats defeated), Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann's overheated speeches and other forms of what New York Times columnist Paul Krugman called \u201celiminationist rhetoric.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Krugman's response to the Tucson shooting was indicative of this thinking. In a column titled \u201cClimate of Hate,\u201d Krugman began: \u201cWhen you heard the terrible news from Arizona, were you completely surprised? Or were you, at some level, expecting something like this atrocity to happen? Put me in the latter category.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn other words, Krugman, like countless others, had his explanation ready before the event even transpired.\n\nThis has become something of a cottage industry for some left-wing activist groups, eager to implicate their political opponents in murder. No doubt this knee-jerk reaction is often sincere. When a Islamist terrorist left a bomb in Times Square, then-New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg no doubt meant it when he speculated that the culprit was an opponent of Obamacare.\n\n\n\nAnd some claim conservatives do they same thing when it comes to terrorist attacks from Muslims. But that strikes me as something categorically different. Islamist mass murders, both attempted and successful, in recent years were done in the name of an international movement, often with material, technical or spiritual assistance from abroad.\n\nThe 2009 Ft. Hood shooter was in contact with Al Qaeda and later admitted his murder rampage was on its behalf. And, unlike the tea party crowd, Al Qaeda actually uses \u201celiminationist rhetoric\u201d \u2014 and not just rhetorically.\n\n\n\nGoing by objective standards of reason and fairness, Al Sharpton is not to blame for the assassination of two New York City cops.\n\nAnd yet, in such cases, the knee-jerk response from the Obama administration and of many liberals is to counsel the very restraint they deny to their domestic political opponents. They try to minimize the event as an \u201cisolated incident.\u201d Amazingly, the administration designated the Ft. Hood killing \u201cworkplace violence.\u201d (Congress just passed legislation, overruling the administration, that would make victims of the attack eligible for Purple Hearts).\n\nNow we have two New York City policemen dead. The killer's postings on social media make it abundantly clear he was motivated in part by the intense furor over the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner. One of Sharpton's \u201cMillion Marchers\u201d mobs even chanted, \u201cWhat do we want? Dead cops! When do we want them? Now!\u201d\n\n\n\nGoing by the standards liberals established, Sharpton clearly has blood on his hands (for this cop-slaying and other hate crimes from his earliest days as a race hustler). And the blame hardly ends there if you go by the rules that were applied to Palin and others.\n\nBut here's the problem: Those rules stink.\n\n\n\nSharpton is a special case; he should have been pelted from the public stage decades ago. But it would be ridiculous to believe that De Blasio or Holder \u2014 or Obama \u2014 wanted this tragedy.\n\nDouble standards are seductive. If you've been demonized unfairly, it is only human to turn the tables at the first opportunity. Giving in to that temptation, however, leads to madness. Conservatives should take the high road \u2014 and liberals should join them \u2014 the next time a madman gives them an opportunity to take the low road.\n\njgoldberg@latimescolumnists.com\n\nFollow the Opinion section on Twitter @latimesopinion", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "The blame game in the New York cop killings shows a demonization double standard", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "Going by objective standards of reason and fairness, Al Sharpton is not to blame for the assassination of two New York City cops over the weekend.
