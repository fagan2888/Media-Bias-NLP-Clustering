She was 32.\n\n\u201cMTV is tremendously sad to hear the news that Diem Brown has lost her long battle with cancer. We send our deepest condolences to her family and friends. Diem was a true fighter and brought passion to everything she touched. We will miss her,\u201d MTV said in a statement provided to msnbc.\n\nBrown rose to fame in 2006 as a cast member of MTV\u2019s \u201cReal World/Road Rules Challenge.\u201d She revealed her cancer diagnosis in her debut challenge and went on to complete in multiple MTV \u201cChallenge\u201d specials, successfully battling two bouts of ovarian cancer along the way. While on the set of her eighth \u201cChallenge\u201d appearance this summer, Brown collapsed \u2013 her cancer had returned for a third and final time, this time spreading to her colon.\n\nBrown maintained a blog about her struggle with cancer on People.com. She wrote about her treatments, the ups and downs, and kept readers up to date even during her toughest days.\n\nAfter her second bout with ovarian cancer, Brown traveled to Washington, D.C. to learn more about the Affordable Care Act. She expressed support for Obamacare, especially because it allowed people with pre-existing conditions, like herself, to access affordable health insurance.\n\n\u201cHaving a pre-existing condition made me feel trapped with my health insurance plan since 2002 with no options \u2013 until now,\u201d Brown wrote in her People.com blog in October 2013. Brown encouraged her readers to visit the health care marketplace last year.\n\nBrown posted her last updates on Nov. 11 via Twitter \u2013 she was optimistic until the end.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Diem Brown, the MTV reality star who was first diagnosed with ovarian cancer at 23, lost her long battle with the disease Friday at the age of 32.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/diem-brown-dies-cancer", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "Diem Brown, the MTV reality star who was first diagnosed with ovarian cancer at 23, lost her long battle with the disease Friday at the age of 32.", "title": "MTV star Diem Brown dies at 32, after public battle with cancer", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/diem-brown-dies-cancer", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/ap129882460560.jpg?itok=XjJfWPTk", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/diem-brown-dies-cancer", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/ap129882460560.jpg?itok=f2lf2zpc", "title": "MTV star Diem Brown dies at 32, after public battle with cancer", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Diem Brown, the MTV reality star who was first diagnosed with ovarian cancer at 23, lost her long battle with the disease Friday at the age of 32."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2014-11-14T17:39:54-05:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "emily-samsel", "tags": "affordable-care-act,health,health-care,health-care-reform", "title": "MTV star Diem Brown dies at 32, after public battle with cancer", "published": 1, "date": "11/14/2014 17:39:54 EST", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/diem-brown-dies-cancer"}, "article": {"author": "http://www.facebook.com/msnbc"}, "abstract": "Diem Brown, the MTV reality star who was first diagnosed with ovarian cancer at 23, lost her long battle with the disease Friday at the age of 32.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Health, Health Care Reform, Affordable Care Act, Health Care"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc286\"", "article_summary": "After her second bout with ovarian cancer, Brown traveled to Washington, D.C. to learn more about the Affordable Care Act.\n\u201cMTV is tremendously sad to hear the news that Diem Brown has lost her long battle with cancer.\nDiem Brown, the MTV reality star who was first diagnosed with ovarian cancer at age 23, lost her long battle with the disease Friday, according to the network.\nBrown encouraged her readers to visit the health care marketplace last year.\n\u201cHaving a pre-existing condition made me feel trapped with my health insurance plan since 2002 with no options \u2013 until now,\u201d Brown wrote in her People.com blog in October 2013."}
