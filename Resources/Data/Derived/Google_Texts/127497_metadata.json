To get the most out of this approach, hospitals must:\n\nUnderstand and appreciate each employee's unique talents. To build an engaged and optimized team, managers first need to discover each person's talents, style, goals, needs and motivations.\n\nIdentify the tasks and activities that each person does best. With an understanding of what each employee does best, managers can use individual contributions to build a stronger team.\n\nHelp employees understand, appreciate and invest in their unique talents. The better that managers can help employees apply their dominant talents, the greater each person's and the team's potential will be to consistently act with confidence, direction and excellence.\n\nJames Merlino, M.D., chief experience officer for the Cleveland Clinic and author of \"Service Fanatics: How to Build Superior Patient Experience the Cleveland Clinic Way,\" knows first-hand how damaging a negative patient experience can be, he told FierceHealthcare in an exclusive interview in October. His father's \"rocky\" hospital stay in 2004 at the Cleveland Clinic led to complications and his eventual death, which inspired Merlino to later spearhead the clinic's patient-centered overhaul.\n\nMerlino emphasized in the interview that support for improving the patient experience starts with an organization's leadership.\"If you don't have the support from the top person in the organization, driving it as a strategic initiative, nothing will change,\" he said.\n\nMichael Macht-Greenberg, Ph.D., a trained psychologist, the vice president of patient access services at Lahey Hospital & Medical Center in Burlington, Massachusetts, told FierceHealthcare he encourages his employees to put themselves in the patients' shoes to make sure they're getting the best experience possible. His philosophy is simple: \"It's a relationship; not a transaction.\"\n\nBut building a better provider-patient relationship starts with the relationship between healthcare managers and their employees, as the Business Journal notes, citing decades of research that indicate employees who use their strengths every day are six times more likely to be engaged in their jobs. In the healthcare sector, engaged employees are also more likely to establish an emotional connection with patients, noted a recent Hospital Impact post, and is a major piece of the optimal-patient-experience puzzle.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the Gallup Business Journal article\n\nRelated Stories:\n\nPatient experience: Personal philosophy, leadership drive improvement\n\nLeading by example: Patient experience the Cleveland Clinic way\n\nThe 3 Ps of patient experience\n\n4 unlikely sources of patient experience success strategies\n\nHow to deliver a world-class patient experience", "article_metadata": {"description": "With more and more healthcare providers\u00a0striving to provide the best possible experience of care\u00a0for patients, a\u00a0Gallup Business Journal\u00a0article\u00a0provides a roadmap for how to spearhead this effort.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "With more and more healthcare providers\u00a0striving to provide the best possible experience of care\u00a0for patients, a\u00a0Gallup Business Journal\u00a0article\u00a0provides a roadmap for how to spearhead this effort.", "title": "3 ways hospitals can create an optimal patient experience", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/3-ways-hospitals-can-create-optimal-patient-experience/2014-12-03", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Delivery,chief patient experience officer,employee engagement,HR & Workforce Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,Patient Experience", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,HR & Workforce Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "article_summary": "To learn more:- read the Gallup Business Journal articleRelated Stories:Patient experience: Personal philosophy, leadership drive improvementLeading by example: Patient experience the Cleveland Clinic wayThe 3 Ps of patient experience4 unlikely sources of patient experience success strategiesHow to deliver a world-class patient experience\nJames Merlino, M.D., chief experience officer for the Cleveland Clinic and author of \"Service Fanatics: How to Build Superior Patient Experience the Cleveland Clinic Way,\" knows first-hand how damaging a negative patient experience can be, he told FierceHealthcare in an exclusive interview in October.\nMerlino emphasized in the interview that support for improving the patient experience starts with an organization's leadership.\nWith an understanding of what each employee does best, managers can use individual contributions to build a stronger team.\nProviding a positive patient experience is a \"carefully choreographed event,\" according to the article, and meeting this goal requires an unwavering commitment from all staff members in a healthcare organization."}
