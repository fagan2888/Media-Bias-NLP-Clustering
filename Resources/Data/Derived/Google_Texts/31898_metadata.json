So, it was a unique opportunity for us, and we took it,\u201d says Chernin.\n\nBut Chernin didn\u2019t jump into the business without a safety net. She and her co-founder continued working full-time, until they were able to turn Barre Bee Fit into a success.\n\n\u201cWe were teaching eight classes a day. We both had our corporate careers, and we invested our life savings and took a chance on our dream,\u201d says Chernin. \u201cIf you have that plan and you execute it and you believe in what you do, anything\u2019s possible.\u201d\n\nProviding a Refuge from Instability\n\nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhile ObamaCare, the government shutdown and the threat of U.S. debt default is creating much uncertainty for small-business owners, Chernin says her fitness studios offer a refuge for her clients.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve actually seen sales increase. I think it\u2019s because \u2026 there\u2019s instability. People will come and they have an escape,\u201d says Chernin. \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting way to kind of use that opportunity, because they love to get that escape and have an outlet.\u201d\n\nChernin says her team just finalized the opening of their seventh studio and are continuing to expand, thanks to their affordable options for women looking to stay fit.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re affordable, we have low rent and we have a great support system. Our staff is wonderful, so we\u2019re able to keep the prices down and women will come,\u201d says Chernin.\n\nChernin says they offer a variety of options for women looking to workout, from a monthly membership for $99 to single classes for $18 a pop. Additionally, women can buy packs of classes as well.\n\n\u201cWe started with a vision to create a movement and really redefine what it meant for women to be strong and healthy,\u201d says Chernin.", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX BUSINESS/COLUMNS/The Conference Room", "dcterms.modified": "2016-03-02 10:59:32 EST", "dcterms.abstract": "Barre Bee Fit co-CEO Ariana Chernin says the recession made it possible for her to open her fitness studio.", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2013/10/16/fitness-guru-saw-opportunity-in-recession.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/media.foxbusiness.com/thumbnails/101413/0/0/101413_fb_conroom_0.jpg?ve=1", "description": "Barre Bee Fit co-CEO Ariana Chernin says the recession made it possible for her to open her fitness studio.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Fitness Guru Saw Opportunity in Recession"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox Business", "parsely-metadata": "{\"tags\":[\"/FOX BUSINESS/COLUMNS/The Conference Room\"],\"author\":\"Gabrielle Karol\",\"subSection\":\"features\",\"title\":\"Fitness Guru Saw Opportunity in Recession\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/media.foxbusiness.com/thumbnails/101413/0/0/101413_fb_conroom_0.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-10-16T13:38:56Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2013/10/16/fitness-guru-saw-opportunity-in-recession.html\",\"type\":\"article\",\"identifier\":\"80c043ff-9ded-48a2-a5e0-75fac1d07362\",\"section\":\"features\"}", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "prism.channel": "fbn", "dc.description": "Barre Bee Fit co-CEO Ariana Chernin says the recession made it possible for her to open her fitness studio.", "dc.identifier": "80c043ff-9ded-48a2-a5e0-75fac1d07362", "dc.language": "en-US", "pagetype": "article", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/mediumtile.png", "parsely-page": "{\"tags\":[\"/FOX BUSINESS/COLUMNS/The Conference Room\"],\"author\":\"Gabrielle Karol\",\"subSection\":\"features\",\"title\":\"Fitness Guru Saw Opportunity in Recession\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/media.foxbusiness.com/thumbnails/101413/0/0/101413_fb_conroom_0.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-10-16T13:38:56Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2013/10/16/fitness-guru-saw-opportunity-in-recession.html\",\"post_id\":\"80c043ff-9ded-48a2-a5e0-75fac1d07362\",\"type\":\"article\",\"section\":\"features\"}", "classification-isa": "conferenceroom", "description": "Barre Bee Fit co-CEO Ariana Chernin says the recession made it possible for her to open her fitness studio.", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/widetile.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/smalltile.png", "prism.section": "features", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/largetile.png", "fb": {"app_id": 116027085089150}, "dc.source": "FOXBusiness", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "dc.title": "Fitness Guru Saw Opportunity In Recession", "dcterms.created": "2016-03-02 10:59:32 EST", "og": {"site_name": "Fox Business", "description": "Barre Bee Fit co-CEO Ariana Chernin says the recession made it possible for her to open her fitness studio.", "title": "Fitness Guru Saw Opportunity in Recession | Fox Business", "url": "http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2013/10/16/fitness-guru-saw-opportunity-in-recession.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/media.foxbusiness.com/thumbnails/101413/0/0/101413_fb_conroom_0.jpg?ve=1", "type": "article"}, "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.date": "2013-10-16", "column": "the-conference-room", "dc.creator": "Gabrielle Karol"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbab6\"", "article_summary": "Where many small-business owners found it impossible to survive the recession, let alone expand, Barre Bee Fit co-CEO Ariana Chernin saw an opportunity to step into the world of entrepreneurship.\n\u201cThe recession and the economy provided us with lower rents [and] easier ways to get business open.\nSo, it was a unique opportunity for us, and we took it,\u201d says Chernin.\nWe both had our corporate careers, and we invested our life savings and took a chance on our dream,\u201d says Chernin.\nOur staff is wonderful, so we\u2019re able to keep the prices down and women will come,\u201d says Chernin."}
