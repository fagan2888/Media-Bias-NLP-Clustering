Under the \u201cRight to Try\u201d bill, a patient with a terminal diagnosis would be allowed to seek out experimental drugs and treatments not yet approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration, according to the Contra Costa Times.\n\nThe bill was a bipartisan effort, introduced by Democrat Assemblyman Ian Calderon of Whittier and principally co-sponsored by Republican Senator Jeff Stone of Temecula.\n\nAdopted thus far in 24 states, the measure is the design of the Arizona-based Goldwater institute. The Times report recorded the institute\u2019s National Policy advisor Kurt Altman from Sunday, saying that Governor Brown \u201chas deprived Californians of the right to try to save their lives when their mortality hangs in the balance. We hope that the Legislature will work together in a bipartisan effort to override Governor Brown\u2019s veto.\u201d\n\nFormer Alaska Governor Sarah Palin warned the public years ago of Obamacare \u201cdeath panels.\u201d Since then Americans have seen continual moves to enable end-of-life measures over potentially life saving measures. Breitbart News reported just over a year ago on moves by the federal government to push the end-of-life option that failed to survive final passage of Obamacare.\n\nAssembly Floor Analysis for AB 159, the \u201cright to try\u201d legislation, details that existing state law, \u201cprohibits, under the Sherman Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Law, the sale, delivery, or giving away of a drug or device unless it has been approved to market by either the FDA or the California Department of Public Health.\u201d\n\nSummary of the legislature passed and Brown vetoed bill reads, \u201cAuthorizes the manufacturer of an investigational drug to make an investigational drug that is not yet approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) available to a patient, under certain circumstances.\u201d Those circumstances include, in part, a person facing a life-threatening disease or condition who has \u201cconsidered all other treatment options currently approved by the FDA,\u201d as detailed in Senate Floor Analysis.\n\nThe bill most recently passed the Senate with no opposition, 40-0, and the Assembly 76-2 with two legislators choosing not to vote.\n\nUpon vetoing the bill, Brown was reported as saying \u201cPatients with life threatening conditions should be able to try experimental drugs,\u201d but that he opposed the bill in favor of a recently implemented federal \u201ccompassionate use\u201d program.\n\nOn the event of the Governor\u2019s passage of the physician assisted suicide bill, Californians against assisted suicide stated, \u201cAs someone of wealth and access to the world\u2019s best medical care and doctors, the Governor\u2019s background is very different than that of millions of Californians living in healthcare poverty without that same access\u2026\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Governor Jerry Brown approved physician assisted suicide then vetoed AB 159, a bill to allow terminally ill Californians life-saving drugs.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Governor Jerry Brown approved physician assisted suicide then vetoed AB 159, a bill to allow terminally ill Californians life-saving drugs.", "title": "Jerry Brown Denies Life After Approving Death Drugs", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 2401, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/06/Jerry-Brown-David-McNew-Getty.jpg", "height": 1801}, "updated_time": "2015-10-15T10:04:36-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/california/2015/10/14/jerry-brown-denies-life-option-approving-death-drugs/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Governor Jerry Brown approved physician assisted suicide then vetoed AB 159, a bill to allow terminally ill Californians life-saving drugs.", "creator": "@michellediana", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/06/Jerry-Brown-David-McNew-Getty.jpg", "title": "Jerry Brown Denies Life After Approving Death Drugs", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "AB 159, Gov.
