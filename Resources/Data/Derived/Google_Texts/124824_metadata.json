The layoffs this week brings to 25 the number of staff reductions this year, he said.\n\n\u201cWe are adjusting our staffing levels in areas where we are confident that we can redesign our process and continue to deliver outstanding levels of care,\u201d he said.\n\nThe changes reflect an ongoing review that the health care system does to reduce costs while maintaining good care and satisfied patients, Williams said. He said University Medical Center and other hospitals struggle to meet patient needs with lower government reimbursement. The Plainsboro hospital opened in 2012.\n\n\u201cAn increasing number of patients are using PHCS\u2019s services, but our costs to provide care are also increasing,\u201d Williams said. \u201cLike many health care institutions, we have been impacted by significant decreases in reimbursement rates.\u201d\n\nAccording to a memo obtained by The Times sent from CEO Barry Rabner to hospital medical staff on Aug. 12, Medicare and Medicaid pay for approximately 50 percent of the care that the hospital provides. Due to a 2 percent cut in Medicare reimbursement the hospital has seen a decrease in reimbursements totaling nearly $2 million, according to the memo. At the same time hospital costs have increased. There has been a 31 percent increase for power costs and a 9 percent increase in the cost of medications, the memo states.\n\nRabner states in the memo that the hospital is focused on working efficiently \u2014 flexing staffing levels based on the number of patients.\n\n\u201cWe are working hard in other areas as well but our efforts to date have not brought us the cost savings we need,\u201d Rabner said in the memo. \u201cWe have now reached the point where despite all our efforts, we unfortunately need to reduce our work force.\u201d\n\nWilliams said that the staffing change directly impacts less than 1 percent of Princeton HealthCare System\u2019s employees.\n\n\u201cPrinceton HealthCare System continuously reviews all aspects of our operations so that we can enhance the quality of the care we provide, increase patient satisfaction and reduce costs,\u201d Williams said.\n\nLast year the health care system announced the elimination of 45 full-time positions, but at the same time they said they had increased the number of total employees, to 3,134.\n\nJenna Pizzi may be reached at jpizzi@njtimes.com.
