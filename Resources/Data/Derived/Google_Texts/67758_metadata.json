In addition, one in five American women reported they had planned or at least considered plastic surgery. Seven percent said they had undergone cosmetic operations before. Over 90 percent of women between the ages of 18 and 24 are unhappy with at least one body part, the survey also found. That\u2019s an incredibly steep number that doesn\u2019t change much as women grow up.\n\n\u201cWhile the total market has previously been calculated by the procedures performed in the past year, we can see that the total addressable market is actually far greater,\u201d said Tom Seery, CEO of RealSelf.com, in a press release. \u201cAs cosmetic procedures continue to become mainstream, millions of women are overcoming social stigma to pursue cosmetic changes they have been researching, often for years.\u201d\n\nAlthough many of these women might toy with the notion of plastic surgery, most don\u2019t follow through with it. Their avoidance comes from several factors. Among the biggest reasons why they don\u2019t go through with it is debt (60 percent), fear of complications (58 percent), fear it would hurt (51 percent), fear from hearing negative stories (47 percent), fear it would make them look worse (41 percent), fear they might die (37 percent), lengthy recovery time (54 percent), and the inability to find a trustworthy, legitimate doctor (40 percent). All pretty solid reasons to not get plastic surgery.\n\nThe survey found that young women were more likely to go out of their way to get help to change a certain body part, including going to spas, retail stores, dermatologists, or plastic surgeons. But all women, regardless of age, were likely to cite their midsections, abdomens, backs, legs, thighs, buttocks, and skin as \u201cproblem areas\u201d they were least happy with.\n\nBDD involves believing that your appearance is defective, and therefore it must be fixed, hidden, or altered in some way to become more attractive. Many people with BDD turn to eating disorders or plastic surgery to ease these intrusive thoughts.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "plastic surgery, body dysmorphic disorder, cosmetics", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A new survey shows that a fairly large percentage of older women are unhappy with at least one of their body parts, and turn to plastic surgery to make them feel better.", "title": "1 In 5 American Women Consider Plastic Surgery", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/1-5-american-women-consider-plastic-surgery-body-image-issues-arent-only-young-girls-323084", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/02/21/plastic-surgery.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A new survey shows that a fairly large percentage of older women are unhappy with at least one of their body parts, and turn to plastic surgery to make them feel better.", "title": "1 In 5 American Women Consider Plastic Surgery", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/1-5-american-women-consider-plastic-surgery-body-image-issues-arent-only-young-girls-323084", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/02/21/plastic-surgery.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/02/21/plastic-surgery.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-02-21T17:30:36-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-22T10:05:08-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A new survey shows that a fairly large percentage of older women are unhappy with at least one of their body parts, and turn to plastic surgery to make them feel better."}, "article_summary": "In addition, one in five American women reported they had planned or at least considered plastic surgery.\nMany people with BDD turn to eating disorders or plastic surgery to ease these intrusive thoughts.\nMany women think about getting plastic surgery to \"fix\" certain body parts they don't find appealing; but not as many actually go through with it.\nAll pretty solid reasons to not get plastic surgery.\n\u201cAs cosmetic procedures continue to become mainstream, millions of women are overcoming social stigma to pursue cosmetic changes they have been researching, often for years.\u201dAlthough many of these women might toy with the notion of plastic surgery, most don\u2019t follow through with it."}
