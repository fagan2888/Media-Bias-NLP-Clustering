Texas Sen. Ted Cruz leveled a series of attacks on the real estate mogul\u2019s bipartisan giving \u2014 most of which were accurate.\n\n\u201cDonald supported John Kerry over George W. Bush,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t like Obamacare, Donald Trump funded Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi taking over Congress to pass Obamacare.\n\n\u201cOn immigration, if you don\u2019t like amnesty, if you don\u2019t like the Gang of Eight, Donald Trump funded five of the eight members of the Gang of Eight, $50,000.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s true Trump has donated to Reid and Pelosi, as well as five members of the so-called Gang of Eight in the Senate, the bipartisan group of lawmakers \u2014 which included Cruz\u2019s current GOP presidential rival Marco Rubio \u2014 who authored ultimately unsuccessful comprehensive immigration reform legislation.\n\nTrump has also made a number of donations to national Democratic party organizations, including in the 2006 election cycle when Democrats wrested away control of both the House and Senate.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nBut Trump did not back then Sen. John Kerry over President Bush: He donated to both campaigns, giving $2,000 to Bush a week before donating the same amount to Kerry, campaign finance data compiled by Political Moneyline show. A 2007 biography of Trump says the billionaire celebrity \u201csupported President George Bush for re-election,\u201d Buzzfeed reported late Thursday.\n\nCruz also pounced on Trump\u2019s past financial support for Democrat Hillary Clinton.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump has written checks to Hillary Clinton not once, not twice, not three times. Ten times. And four of those checks were not to her Senate campaign. It wasn't that she was the New York senator and it was a cost of doing business. It was to her presidential campaign,\u201d Cruz said.\n\nThat\u2019s true: Trump has given frequently to Clinton\u2019s campaigns, and has supported her family\u2019s foundation. The donations to Clinton's presidential campaign totaled $4,600. Trump also served as a fundraiser for 2008 GOP presidential nominee John McCain. The Center for Responsive Politics reported Trump bundled $88,250 worth of donations for the McCain campaign.\n\nOver the course of the 2016 campaign, Trump has faced repeated questions about his donations to Democrats. NPR previously found Trump mostly favored Democrats until 2010, and he\u2019s given almost exclusively to Republicans in the years since.\n\nAccording to an International Business Times review of data from Political Moneyline, Trump has given nearly $1.5 million to GOP candidates and political groups on the federal level since 1979. The billionaire has donated roughly $405,000 to Democratic politicians and committees during that same span of time.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://s2.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "donald trump, trump, donations, clinton, hillary clinton, ted cruz, cruz, kerry, john kerry, george w bush, bush, gave, money, john mccain, mccain, fundraiser, bundler, bundled, contribute, bipartisan, pelosi, reid", "og": {"site_name": "International Business Times", "description": "But Trump also contributed to Republican candidates, including George W.
