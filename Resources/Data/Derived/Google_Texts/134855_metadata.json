We stand for biblical and traditional marriage.\u201d\n\nDr. Floyd reminded the gathering of something German theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer once said: \u201cSilence in the face of evil is itself evil: God will not hold us guiltless. Not to speak is to speak. Not to act is to act.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a Bonhoeffer moment for every pastor in the United States,\u201d Floyd said, warning ministers that the time has come for every minister to stand strongly and clearly \u2013 regardless of the cost.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what Bonhoeffer did,\u201d he said.\n\nThe pending decision over gay marriage weighed heavily on the minds of many Southern Baptists and messengers will consider a resolution calling on all Christians to stand firm on the biblical definition of marriage.\n\n\u201cResolved, that Southern Baptists recognize that no governing institution has the authority to negate or usurp God\u2019s definition of marriage; and be it further resolved no matter how the Supreme Court rules, the Southern Baptist Convention reaffirms its unwavering commitment to its doctrinal and public beliefs concerning marriage,\u201d the resolution reads in part.\n\nEvangelical Christians across America fear a decision legalizing same-sex marriage would have a devastating impact on religious liberty.\n\nA growing number of Christians have already faced persecution because of their objections to gay marriage. Public workers have lost their jobs, private business owners have been slapped with lawsuits and complaints and private citizens have been bullied and harassed for signing pro-traditional marriage petitions.\n\nIt\u2019s not exactly clear how the Southern Baptist Convention\u2019s defiance will manifest itself \u2014 but Floyd revealed his personal plan.\n\n\u201cI declare to everyone today as a minister of the Gospel \u2013 I will not officiate over any same-sex unions or same-sex marriage ceremonies,\u201d he said. \u201cI completely refuse.\u201d\n\nDr. Floyd stood resolute \u2013 the face of what I am sure will be national attacks from intolerant bullies and the radical speech police. There is no doubt he will be called a homophobic bigot. I\u2019m sure some will label his remarks as hate speech.\n\nI urge you to ignore them and truly listen to this brave man of God\u2019s words \u2013 his call to \u201clove and respect those who do not agree with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd while we affirm our love for all people, including those struggling with same-sex attraction, we cannot and will not affirm any behavior that deviates from God\u2019s design for marriage,\u201d he said.\n\nThe issue facing Southern Baptists is one that will face every person of faith in the United States \u2013 do you follow God or the government?\n\n\u201cOur first commitment is to God and His Word \u2013 nothing else and no one else,\u201d Dr. Floyd said matter-of-factly.\n\nAmen, sir.
