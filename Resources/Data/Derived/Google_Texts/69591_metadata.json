Some of this zeal is well-directed. Mr. Rothfus, 52, has stressed constituent service and has held more than 60 \u201ccoffees with Keith\u201d that were open to the public.\n\nOn the flip side, he also voted with the Republicans in the House a year ago to shut down the government, which achieved nothing and cost the treasury billions, for which he blames Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. He can\u2019t even promise not to do it again in the future \u2014 he says it would depend on the circumstances. He has also voted multiple times to repeal the Affordable Care Act, the growing success of which he does not believe.\n\nAs it happens, the Democrat, Erin McClelland, 39, of Harrison brings a special expertise in health care to the race, an issue she is passionate about. Having obtained academic degrees in psychology, she started a nonprofit business specializing in addiction treatment. One of her pet causes is reducing medical errors. While she does not pretend that the Affordable Care Act is perfect, she would be a sincere and knowledgeable reformer of it.\n\n19th House District: Democrat Jake Wheatley\n\nWhoever said that all politics is local clearly had the 19th House District in mind.\n\nDemocratic state Rep. Jake Wheatley of the Hill District is being challenged by school board member Mark Brentley Sr. of Allegheny West, running as an independent. Both know the district; both are involved in community efforts beyond the scope of their elected offices.\n\nMr. Wheatley, 42, is seeking his seventh two-year term. Mr. Brentley, 57, who has been on the school board for 15 years, is in his fourth House run. In an interview with Post-Gazette editors, the candidates engaged some statewide issues but were more focused on matters in the district.\n\n39th House District: Republican Rick Saccone\n\nTwo years ago, the Post-Gazette endorsed state Rep. Rick Saccone\u2019s challenger because the Republican incumbent was out of sync with our positions on various issues.\n\nSince then, we\u2019ve been critical of his proposal to let school districts display the motto \u201cIn God We Trust,\u201d and his allegiance to the National Rifle Association on behalf of assorted measures. Earlier, we also opposed his resolution to make 2012 the \u201cYear of the Bible.\u201d\n\nIn addition, we disagree with the two-term lawmaker on the need for a Marcellus Shale extraction tax \u2014 he\u2019s against it \u2014 and the unduly optimistic House Bill 76, which would cut property taxes but could hurt low- and middle-income families with higher sales and income taxes \u2014 he\u2019s for it.\n\nBut there is no getting around the fact that Mr. Saccone, 56, of Elizabeth Township is an intelligent, articulate advocate for his positions. Those who disagree with the St. Vincent College professor won\u2019t find an equally capable opponent in Democrat Lisa Stout-Bashioum, 53, of Somerset, Washington County.\n\n35th House District: Democrat Marc Gergely\n\nState Rep. Marc Gergely says he doesn\u2019t want to be a lifer in the Legislature, but he does want another term. The White Oak Democrat discussed why he deserves a seventh term in a meeting last week with Post-Gazette editors, an opportunity his challenger, Republican Kenneth Peoples, refused.\n\nMr. Peoples, 42, also of White Oak, was unhappy with the Post-Gazette\u2019s decision last year to endorse his opponent over him in their race for Allegheny County Council, but it was an easy call. At the time, Mr. Peoples said he wanted to abolish the 1 percent Allegheny Regional Asset District sales tax, an unqualified success that has contributed to the vitality of big-city and small-town amenities.\n\nBut Mr. Gergely, 45, did more than show up for this contest\u2019s interview. He spoke knowledgeably and comprehensively about key issues confronting the state and District 35.\n\n33rd House District: Democrat Frank Dermody\n\nVoters in the 33rd House District have a tough choice on Nov. 4 \u2014 stick with a smart, senior lawmaker or take a chance on a bright, thoughtful newcomer. After 22 years in office, Rep. Frank Dermody\u2019s clout in Harrisburg gives him the advantage in serving the Allegheny River Valley.\n\nRepublican challenger Sean Watson, 34, of East Deer is a small-businessman who represents makers of sustainable building products to contractors. He said he\u2019s running because he wants the responsibility of making the state better for his children and other Pennsylvanians.\n\nMr. Dermody, 63, is a Democrat from Oakmont who still enjoys the politics of the job, which he says enables him to help fix Pennsylvania\u2019s problems. He believes the state will have a new governor in January, which would increase the legislator\u2019s influence in the House even if the Republicans keep control.\n\n25th House District: Democrat Joseph Markosek\n\nDemocratic Rep. Joseph Markosek has been a member of the Pennsylvania Legislature for 32 years, and his Republican challenger this year gives voters no reason to make a change now.\n\nMr. Markosek, 64, of Monroeville sits on the powerful Appropriations Committee, where the details of the state\u2019s annual operating and capital budgets are worked out. Like his fellow Democrats, he is limited because Republicans control the House and Senate, but his long experience in the chamber still translates into influence for his constituents and Allegheny County.\n\nHis extensive tenure has not dulled Mr. Markosek\u2019s enthusiasm for the work. If he gets his way, the state will start imposing an extraction tax on Marcellus Shale drillers, using some of the dollars it would bring to pay for K-12 and higher education and human services programs. He disagrees with Gov. Tom Corbett\u2019s refusal to expand Medicaid and would have taken the federal dollars that would have come with it.\n\nRepublican John Ritter, 60, also of Monroeville, is a computer scientist by training and a contract employee for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s National Center for Health Statistics.\n\n20th House District: Republican Tom Fodi\n\nTom Fodi is not a typical candidate. The Republican running in the state\u2019s 20th House District was a Democrat until January, says he is frustrated by \u201cparty politics,\u201d describes himself as a small-L libertarian and holds positions that don\u2019t line up well with any of those labels.\n\nHe is challenging Adam Ravenstahl, who is seeking his third full term for the seat. Like many Democrats, Mr. Ravenstahl, 29, of Summer Hill is pinning hope for change on having Tom Wolf in the governor\u2019s office, although control of the House \u2014 advantage Republicans \u2014 is not expected to flip with the Nov. 4 election regardless of who wins at the top of the ballot.\n\nIn Harrisburg, the younger brother of Pittsburgh\u2019s former mayor has voted the party line and followed the direction of his leaders. In an interview with Post-Gazette editors, his views sounded all too predictable, with little suggestion of independence or his own ideas.\n\n46th House District: Democrat Jesse White\n\nThe Republican Party would really like to see that Democratic state Rep. Jesse White doesn\u2019t get a sixth term. The party is responsible for a series of scathing mailers that rightly criticize Mr. White for his sophomoric stunt last year of creating false identities to take shots at his own critics on the Internet, but wrongly paint him with demeaning labels such as \u201cderanged,\u201d \u201cmean,\u201d \u201csick\u201d and \u201cdemented.\u201d\n\nThe GOP should have put more time and attention into a selecting a candidate to challenge Mr. White in the race to represent the 46th District.\n\nRepublican nominee Jason Ortitay, 30, of South Fayette, is engaging and an enthusiastic booster for the region, but the business owner \u2014 he manufactures cheesecakes for sale by fund-raising organizations \u2014 offered few important contrasts to the incumbent, was uninformed on too many topics during an interview with Post-Gazette editors and relied on the old trope of finding waste and improving efficiency to address the state\u2019s budgetary challenges.\n\n45th House District: Democrat Nick Kotik\n\nThe race in the state\u2019s 45th House District offers voters a choice between a dependable, somewhat conservative six-term Democrat and a Republican with a libertarian bent who was recently a Democrat.\n\nRep. Nick Kotik, 63, of Kennedy, has been concerned about equitable funding for education and supports a possible way to raise revenues \u2014 through an extraction tax on Marcellus Shale drillers. He favors, however, a hybrid extraction tax married to the existing impact fee, because municipalities have come to depend on it, and he would not want the tax to be too high.\n\nRepublican challenger Benjamin Gross, a corporate attorney from Rosslyn Farms, is mostly in sync with these social views. He too describes himself as pro-life and supports gay marriage and workplace equality. He favors full legalization of marijuana, going further than Mr. Kotik, who is a supporter only of medical use of marijuana.\n\nGovernor of Pennsylvania Neither candidate\n\nTry as we might, it is impossible for the Post-Gazette to endorse either Mr. Wolf, the former state revenue secretary who revived his family\u2019s cabinet manufacturing firm, or Mr. Corbett, who was appointed once and elected twice as state attorney general before becoming governor. Despite extensive interviews with the candidates, both of whom are 65, we believe that neither possesses the strong leadership skills that Pennsylvania needs in a chief executive.\n\nDespite his experience as an elected official, Mr. Corbett became governor four years ago as a novice in dealing with the Legislature, and he never figured out how to win the allies and exert the influence he needed to advance most of his agenda. His supporters say deal-making is not in his nature, but they too freely give him a pass that ignores the amount of plea bargaining and other negotiations that are common in the prosecutor\u2019s office. Regardless, his ability to harness the power of a Republican majority in both chambers never matured and now the Nov. 4 election is a stark referendum on him as an incumbent.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A series of candidate endorsements by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette editorial board for contested races in the Nov. 4 election.", "og": {"site_name": "Pittsburgh Post-Gazette", "description": "12th Congressional District Democrat Erin McClelland Republican incumbent Keith Rothfus, a lawyer who lives in Sewickley, has spent his freshman term applying his conservative, Tea Party-style philosophy to the faithful service of his party.
