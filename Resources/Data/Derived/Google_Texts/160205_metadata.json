Beaty, Jr., who serves in the Middle District of North Carolina in Winston-Salem, will take senior status at the end of June, 2014, as confirmed by chambers.\n\nJudge Beaty, the lone African-American federal district court judge in North Carolina, was appointed by President Clinton in 1994 and served as chief judge for the district from 2006 to 2012. Before taking a seat on the federal bench, Beaty had served as a judge in Forsyth County Superior Court for 13 years.\n\nBy taking senior status, Judge Beaty can continue to receive his current salary but is not required to carry a full caseload. His seat, however, becomes vacant.\n\nBeaty\u2019s vacancy will be the second in the federal district courts in North Carolina, with the now 8-year vacancy in the Eastern District still in abeyance.\n\nAlthough President Obama nominated Jennifer May-Parker for that seat back in June, U.S. Senator Richard Burr has failed without explanation to support that nomination, leaving the likelihood of her confirmation in question.\n\nBeaty\u2019s decision to take senior status follows that of Maryland-based Fourth Circuit Judge Andre M. Davis, who announced that he will take senior status in February 2014.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Beaty\u2019s decision to take senior status follows that of Maryland-based Fourth Circuit Judge Andre M.
