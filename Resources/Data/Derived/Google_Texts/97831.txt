Farrah is rooting for Hillary all the way, presumably as part of her new feminist lease of life. “I'm ready to get my #Hilary2016 Pantsuit on!” she tweeted . “#Iowa & beyond #VoteYes.”

Remember back in ye olden days when Farrah Abraham endorsed Mitt Romney and explained to everyone via YouTube why she was a Republican? Well, times have changed — this girl is supporting Hillary Clinton in the 2016 elections!

Farrah also seemed to be taking a pro-choice stand, because she tweeted out the following Hil quote: “They shame and blame women rather than respect our right to make our own reproductive health decisions.”

Now that Farrah is all about Hillary, let's take a walk down memory lane to Farrah's endorsement of Mitt back in 2012. Not only did Farrah agree with Mitt on repealing “Obamacare” and instituting income tax cuts, she said she was “either way” on same sex marriage, but that it's “not that important” to her.

She also seemed to imply that she was pro-choice, saying, “That's something I feel is pro choice, so again, those are the other ones that I'm not really looking at that decipher who I am voting for.”

Stop the search, Hillary: you just found a Vice Presidential candidate.
