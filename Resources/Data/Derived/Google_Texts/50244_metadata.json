I do care that he has, when all is said and done, achieved a lot.\u201d\n\nThis then provoked CNN to hold a seven minute long discussion on the topic, with their segment, \u201cObama: One of the Best Presidents?\u201d This was hosted by anchor Don Lemon, who, alongside his two guests, Ron Brownstein, a Senior Political Analyst for the network, and Crystal Wright, an editor and publisher who works for Conservative Black Chick, discussed Obama\u2019s legacy.\n\nYou can check out footage of their discussion below.\n\nDuring their conversation, neither Brownstein nor Wright actually came anywhere near to agreeing with Krugman\u2019s insistence that Obama will be regarded as one of the best presidents in American history.\n\nHowever, Brownstein did concede that he believes Obama will eventually be recognized as a significant leader of the country though.\n\n\u201cSaying one of the most successful ever is pushing it. I think history will see Obama as a consequential president, both politically and substantively.\u201d\n\nBrownstein also noted that it will be the success of the Affordable Care Act that will ultimately decide if Obama is viewed as having been a triumph in the White House.\n\n\u201cHe does have the potential\u2026 to expand coverage to over 20 million people without health insurance by the end of his term, maybe even 25 million without health insurance. If that endures, I think that is an enduring lasting change in the American safety net that he will be remembered for.\u201d\n\nWright was firmly against Krugman\u2019s analysis though, and she even declared, \u201cI think the President will go down as one of the most unsuccessful presidents when it comes to foreign policy and Obamacare.\u201d\n\nDo you believe that Barack Obama is one of the most successful presidents in U.S. history?\n\n[Image via Noticiassin]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Barack Obama's approval rating is currently hovering around the 42 percent mark, but that hasn't stopped a New York Times columnist from insisting that he is", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "Barack Obama\u2019s approval rating is currently hovering around the 42 percent mark, but that hasn\u2019t stopped a New York Times columnist from insisting that he is", "title": "Barack Obama Is One Of America\u2019s Most Successful Presidents, Columnist Argues", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/1538318/barack-obama-is-americas-most-successful-ever-president-columnist-argues-do-you-agree/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/67011.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-13T15:45:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-13T16:18:49+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/67011.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2014-10-13T15:45:11+00:00", "fb": {"app_id": 164157850314499, "pages": 71179904752}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "barack obama,barack obama president,barack obama successful,paul krugman,paul krugman barack obama,news", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/67011.jpg", "height": 409, "width": 670}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Barack Obama\u2019s approval rating is currently hovering around the 42 percent mark, but that hasn\u2019t stopped a New York Times columnist from insisting that he is"}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbf1e\"", "article_summary": "Barack Obama\u2019s approval rating is currently hovering around the 42 percent mark, but that hasn\u2019t stopped a New York Times columnist from insisting that he is one of the most successful presidents in American history.\nHowever, Brownstein did concede that he believes Obama will eventually be recognized as a significant leader of the country though.\nDuring their conversation, neither Brownstein nor Wright actually came anywhere near to agreeing with Krugman\u2019s insistence that Obama will be regarded as one of the best presidents in American history.\n\u201cSaying one of the most successful ever is pushing it.\n\u201cNo president gets to do everything his supporters expected him to\u2026 I don\u2019t care about the fact that Obama hasn\u2019t lived up to the golden dreams of 2008, and I care even less about his approval rating."}
