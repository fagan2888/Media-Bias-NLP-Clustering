Saul Alinsky\u2019s Rules for Radicals, the playbook of Obama, Hillary Clinton and other liberal Democrats in power today, taught the left how to undermine the successful, brilliant, longstanding representative democracy this country was founded on, in order to accomplish their unpopular, unfair and historically discredited radical agenda.\n\nAlinsky advocated using arguments that sound \u201cmoral\u201d to trick people emotionally. Who could be against poor children? Is dumping illegal immigrant children in various states around the country instead of deporting them - separating them from their parents - moral? No, it is really despicable, since it exploits the children in order to shove through a radical open borders agenda.\n\nTheir so-called \u201ccompassion\u201d is selective. Why not rescue all the poor children in the world and invite them to the U.S.? Of the 2.2 billion children worldwide, almost half, or 1 billion, live in poverty. The population of the U.S. is a little over 300 million, so there is no way the U.S. could possibly afford to take in and pay for all those children.\n\nThe left\u2019s Illegal immigration defenders accuse Americans of being racist who do not want to allow the illegal immigrant \u201cchildren\u201d in the U.S. to remain \u2026 yet note the Obama administration is generally releasing teenagers who are mostly ages 15-17. If that\u2019s true, then isn\u2019t the left equally as racist for not helping children in the poorest countries too? The poorest countries in the world are predominantlylocated in Africa. These children are worse off than the primarily Hispanic illegal immigrant children who crossed over our southern border illegally.\n\nAn argument could be made that the left is racist against the poorer blacks; instead giving special preference to Hispanic children. But conservatives aren\u2019t cold-blooded enough to demonize the left this way, being the real party of compassion. Conservatives generally prefer immigration policies that are spread out fairly across countries, not weighted in favor of certain countries (ethnicities or races) over others.\n\nThe recent influx of illegal immigrant children are being dumped in conservative states, not just in the open borders states that welcome them. They are shipped as far away as conservative Alaska, which makes no sense, considering its distance from their home countries and parents. This is yet more evidence the effort is not humanitarian, but a political ploy using children as pawns.\n\nHypocritically, the liberal states are protesting the dumping of illegal immigrants (or more likely, the conservative parts of those states are protesting), and have successfully forced the administration to stop shipping them there. These include Baltimore, Md., Lynn, Mass., Hazleton, Pa. and Murrieta, Calif.\n\nEven more disturbing, the Obama administration is not informing local governments in advance prior to dumping off these children. Obama is continuing his war between the federal government and the states, which intensified in 2010 when he had his Attorney General, Eric Holder, file a lawsuit against Arizona over its strict new immigration law, SB 1070. We are entering a scary new era where the federal government attacks and litigates against the state governments, setting off a 10th Amendment fight.\n\nWe have learned that journalists are only being given partial information from the Obama administration, and are forced to get much of their information through leaks. According toThe Washington Times, \u201cthe Department of Health and Human Services has received 53,324 unaccompanied minors from the Department of Homeland Security and has released 48,805 of them.\u201d No one knows these children who are being brought into their localities, and the children don\u2019t know where they\u2019re going.\n\nThe increase in young illegal immigrants entering the country began in June 2012, when Obama instructed federal agencies to stop deporting most young illegal immigrants. It is now being revealed that many of these \u201cchildren\u201d aren\u2019t children, but 22-year old gang members. Texas Catholic Charities admitted to Breitbart.com that most of the \u201cchildren\u201d are between ages 15 and 17. The children are then placed with foster families, who receive money from the government for their care; an eye-popping $40 per day (pretty incredible if you\u2019ve ever had to pinch pennies and live off Top Ramen for extended periods of time). In addition, the illegal immigrant children also receive health care, public education and an allowance!\n\nSome have gone so far as to compare this abuse of children to Hamas\u2019s use of its own children as shields from Israeli bombing. While not as extreme, it is still wrong to manipulate the lives of children and abuse them for political means.\n\nAll of this is happening because Obama realizes that Obamacare, which he had intended to make his legacy, has been a dismal failure. He\u2019s now turning to making amnesty his achievement instead. If he can spread out the illegal immigrant children around the states, where people will be exposed to them, getting to know them - it will become much harder to object to them.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Who could be against poor children?
