He says that colder weather makes the starter in a car have to work harder to turn the engine over.\n\n\"The oil is harder...harder for the starter to turn so it pulls more juice from the battery and the battery cannot handle it once it is getting older,\" Wood said.\n\nHe suspects that a mild fall has many car batteries holding on and with an incoming cold snap, those batteries will fail.\n\nMany car batteries are warrantied to last between two and five years. Having an emergency kit in a car with jumper cables can help get the car started again.\n\nIf a car is getting notably slow or sluggish to start, that can be a sign that the battery is getting ready to die. AAA suggests that the car owner get the battery looked at.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "With temperatures expected to become much colder, it could take more work for your cars battery to start the engine", "language": "english", "author": "Bryan Ramsdale", "og": {"description": "With temperatures expected to become much colder, it could take more work for your cars battery to start the engine", "title": "Cold weather can reveal weak car batteries", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Cold-weather-can-reveal-weak-car-batteries-365543391.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/B8F/7C3/B8F7C3DDE0604CDFA0021F952C4A4D87", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/ECF/BD1/ECFBD14DD0384906B42FD1ACA18FE54E.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "With temperatures expected to become much colder, it could take more work for your cars battery to start the engine", "title": "Cold weather can reveal weak car batteries", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Cold-weather-can-reveal-weak-car-batteries-365543391.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/Cold+Weather+Battery+1.16.16.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Cold weather can reveal weak car batteries", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Cold weather can reveal weak"}, "article_summary": "Car batteries are notorious for dying during cold snaps, stranding drivers in the cold.\nHe suspects that a mild fall has many car batteries holding on and with an incoming cold snap, those batteries will fail.\nCold weather is hard on not only humans but also their machines.\nMany car batteries are warrantied to last between two and five years.\nHe says that colder weather makes the starter in a car have to work harder to turn the engine over."}
