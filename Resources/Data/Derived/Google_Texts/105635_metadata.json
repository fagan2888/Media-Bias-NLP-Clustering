Rick Scott will be in Washington Wednesday and Thursday to talk to Congressional leaders about the need for money to fight Zika (Photo: Joe Raedle, Getty Images)\n\nGov. Rick Scott heads to Washington D.C. Wednesday where he intends to get Congress to focus on Zika. Florida leads the nation in the number of Zika infections and that is making Scott an unlikely ally of President Barack Obama's request for $1.9 billion to fight the mosquito-borne virus.\n\nCongressional leaders are refusing to meet Obama\u2019s request. They say there is enough money left over from the effort to fight an Ebola outbreak to fill the need until the next budget cycle. The dispute puts Scott in an unusual position, advocating for more federal government spending. Scott first ventured into politics as the head of a group opposed to Obamacare. As a fiscal conservative, he generally believes government spending distorts market forces and has an overall negative impact on the economy.\n\nBut Florida health officials warn a wet rainy summer could lead to an explosion in the mosquito population and ignite a Zika outbreak along the Gulf Coast like a powder keg. Scott told reporters Tuesday his job is to keep Florida's 20 million residents safe.\n\n\u201cMy goal is to get the money here,\u201d said Scott. \u201cI\u2019m going to Washington and I\u2019m going to talk to congressional men and women and Senators. Some of our mosquito control boards are (also) going up there and they\u2019re going to tell them what additional resources they need.\u201d\n\nThe Zika virus can cause birth defects and leave adults with the paralyzing Guillain-Barre syndrome. Scientists have identified the yellow fever mosquito and the Asian tiger mosquito as potential carriers. The virus can also be transmitted through sexual relations.\n\nAll Florida cases have been traveled related, none has been linked to a Florida mosquito.\n\nZika symptoms are usually mild, including an itchy rash, fever, joint pain and pink eye. Eighty percent of patients have no symptoms at all, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nScott and representatives of Florida mosquito control boards will meet with Congressional leaders Wednesday and Thursday. Scott said he intends to tell Congress that the state is preparing for Zika like it is a hurricane, but his focus was clearly on getting money from Washington.\n\n\u201cWe got to have a federal plan,\u201d said Scott. \u201cWhether it is more money for mosquito boards. Whether it is to make sure we have the right testing kits, make sure we have all the resources. All of these things. The federal government needs to come together, work together and provide the funds for the things that are necessary to our state.\u201d\n\nReporter James Call can be reached at jcall@tallahassee.com and follow on Twitter @CallTallahassee.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.tdo.com/1T9BDel", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Gov.
