Bush\u2019s War on Terror. McKay then changed his story to claim Darby gave him the idea to make the bombs and guided the effort. McKay then changed his story again and admitted he alone had the idea and made the bombs and that he had been lying about the FBI and Darby being involved in setting him up or giving him ideas.\n\nOnce in prison, McKay again changed his story to insinuate that Darby was his mentor and that Darby created an environment where McKay felt the need to impress Darby and prove his manhood by making bombs. Regardless of the numerous claims and admitted dishonesty of McKay, many left-of-center media outlets, such as the New York Times, embraced the new version of events and attacked Darby for \u201cencouraging\u201d the bomb plot. PBS and funding from George Soros helped make a documentary defending McKay and his cohort while attacking Darby.\n\nThe late Andrew Breitbart discovered Darby and defended him, befriended him, and ultimately convinced him of the importance of fighting back against the radical left and their defenders in the left-of-center mainstream media.\n\n\u201cAndrew taught me to embrace the hate from the left, along with their use of personal attacks when shown incorrect, and to walk into the fire,\u201d said Darby in a phone interview with Breitbart News. \u201cIt\u2019s strange that they attack me and attack me, and then attack me for talking back to their false narratives.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs the recent Huffington Post piece on the upcoming film shows, when they are shown to have lied on a topic, they simply begin personal attacks,\u201d said Darby. \u201cIt was an honor to work undercover with the FBI and I embrace the opportunity to defend what I participated in with them, even if it\u2019s to a hostile crowd who chooses to side with a dishonest leftist bomb-maker for no apparent reason other than to justify their hatred of law enforcement and conservatives,\u201d said Darby.\n\nWhen asked why he would agree to debate McKay in front of what will likely be a left-of-center audience, Darby replied: \u201cHe [McKay] wanted to debate me, I\u2019m not sure why. Maybe he thinks he will get some resolve, but I don\u2019t think he will get the resolve he is hoping for if he chooses to debate rather than have a discussion.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity for dialogue and I think I should embrace the opportunity, just as Andrew [Breitbart] embraced going on Bill Maher\u2019s show,\u201d Darby added. \u201cSometimes it is empowering to face irrational hate and walk into it, rather than trying to ignore it.\u201d\n\nThe event starts at 7:30 PM, Wednesday, September 11, 2013 at the Elinor Bunin Munroe Film Center, Amphitheater, 144 W. 65th St., New York.\n\nThe screening will be followed by a discussion with director Jamie Meltzer and subjects Brandon Darby and David McKay. (McKay will join via Skype)\n\nRSVP required to: informantscreening@gmail.com.
