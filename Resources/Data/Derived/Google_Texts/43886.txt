More than 2 million people who signed up for a health plan under Obamacare aren't getting a tax credit subsidy because they picked a plan that doesn't qualify for subsidies, according to a new analysis.

Of the 8.1 million individuals who enrolled for coverage in 2015 in the Obamacare exchanges and were eligible for subsidies, only 5.9 million are actually getting a subsidy, according to the health research firm Avalere Health. The problem is that the other enrollees picked a health plan that doesn't qualify for subsidies.

"Consumers are picking plans on exchanges based on premiums, rather than out-of-pocket costs," said Dan Mendelson, Avalere's CEO, in a press release. "As a result, some patients may be paying more than they need to for care."

Avalere said some people might be able to get a cheaper plan if they spend a little more up front, then benefit from the subsidy. "While cost-sharing reductions can help reduce what patients pay when they visit a doctor or hospital, some consumers may be unaware of the potential benefits," he said.

For example, some consumers are likely enrolling in the low-premium bronze plan, but need to be in the slightly more expensive silver plan to qualify for subsidies, Avalere said. "Meanwhile, other consumers may not be aware that cost-sharing reductions may not be available," the firm said.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated that about 3 million consumers will forego getting subsidies because they signed up for a bronze plan. Avalere recommended more consumer education to detail the benefits of the plans and the subsidies.
