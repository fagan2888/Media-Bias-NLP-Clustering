Friday’s stunning news that House Speaker John Boehner is resigning at the end of October has set the political world ablaze with speculation as to who is next in line for the job.

One name being bandied about is U.S. Rep. Tom Price, whose sixth congressional district includes portions of Brookhaven, Chamblee, Dunwoody, Sandy Springs, Alpharetta, Johns Creek, Tucker and Roswell.

Shortly after news broke of Boehner’s plans, Charlie Harper, founder of the political blog Peach Pundit, speculated that Price could be in line for a more prominent GOP leadership role on Capitol Hill.

“Price works well with members across the GOP spectrum,” Harper wrote. “ He’s chaired the conservative Republican Study Committee and the House Policy Committee. He’s currently the House Budget Chairman, and has put forth the only workable House alternative to the Affordable Care Act.”

If House conservatives rally around House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Harper said, “the race for speaker may be relatively short. If there is dissension or open rebellion, all bets are off ... Perhaps Price will have the opportunity to clean up that mess.”

Price has also been mentioned as one of several Republicans who could be in line for the job should Boehner resign. Price passed on Georgia’s open U.S. Senate race in 2014, choosing to remain in the House.

“Speaker John Boehner has served the House of Representatives with honor,” Price said in a statement released late Friday morning. “He has served at a time of tremendous challenges, and he has always maintained an admirable and healthy sense of purpose and perspective. I thank John and his family for that service, and wish them well in the days ahead.”
