Demonstrating himself to be a man steeped in America\u2019s founding principles and a patriot who expects Washington to listen, Cruz pulls the curtain back in this exclusive video interview to expose why government grows, while economic and personal liberties recede.\n\nCruz, who\u2019s expected to be a 2016 favorite among grassroots conservatives, found President Obama\u2019s recent National Prayer Breakfast remarks \u201cstunning.\u201d He continued, \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be that hard for a president to lift us up or speak goodness to evil.\u201d\n\nYet, the Republican senator says, Obama \u201cpreached a false moral equivalence that every religion is equal.\u201d The president \u201cdidn\u2019t even have the courage to praise Egyptian President el-Sisi for recently calling out the radicals\u201d who are perverting the Muslim faith, Cruz said.\n\nCruz calls comments by Democrat Pat Caddell \u2014 who was featured in a popular video interview in this Leader series last week \u2014 lambasting the Republican leadership for estrangement from their base \u201ctruthful.\u201d He says it is an \u201cact of heresy in Washington to tell this truth.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe biggest divide in politics is between career politicians in both parties in Washington and the American people,\u201d the senator says.\n\nCruz is most proud of his efforts to stop the train wreck that is Obamacare. As he travels around the nation, he hears of lost health care coverage, lost jobs, and rising premiums. Yet, he says \u201ccareer politicians in both parties are perfectly happy to let Obamacare remain a permanent feature of our economy.\u201d Cruz elevated the Obamacare debate, and leadership still hasn\u2019t thanked Cruz for waging the battle that galvanized a nation, convincing enough voters last November that Republicans might really fight to stop Obama\u2019s transformation of the nation.\n\nThe Texan thinks the only way to change what Pat Caddell is talking about is for the American people to rise up. From all he can see from the inside, \u201cWashington is not listening.\u201d\n\nCruz tells the revealing insider story of the 2014 debt ceiling battle, where too many Republicans said one thing and then did another, when it came to restraining out of control spending. Cruz said he wasn\u2019t surprised when President Obama audaciously demanded Congress raise the government credit card limit without any spending reforms. But the House approved it, with only 28 Republicans voting with 190 Democrats to pass a clean debt ceiling per the President\u2019s request, to the acclaim of Wall Street and media elites.\n\nNext the Senate had to pass H.R. 325. Just as the Senate is now experiencing with the current battle over DHS spending that contains a defunding of executive amnesty, to proceed to consider a bill takes 60 votes. But the 60 vote threshold can be altered if the Senate changed it by unanimous consent. Senate Republican leaders, not objecting to more spending, more debt, wanted to \u201ckick the can down the road.\u201d Cruz reports GOP leaders asked all their senators to affirmatively consent to lower the threshold from 60 to 50 votes. The result? If we lowered it, Cruz says, it would \u201callow us to vote no on the substance and tell our constituents that we opposed what we just consented to allow happen.\u201d\n\nCruz objected to the game, and says \u201cnothing has engendered more animosity and vitriol in Washington than that.\u201d It\u2019s interesting to note that this Wall Street Journal editorial wrongly predicted Cruz\u2019s battle would result in the Democrats retaining the majority in the fall 2014 elections, but no public apologies have been issued to Cruz from the Journal editorial page.\n\nThe senator told Republican leaders, \u201cI can\u2019t lie to the people who elected me.\u201d The truth is \u201cshining the light on the game being played in D.C. is worse than insulting another\u201d senator, he says.\n\nDiscussing President Obama\u2019s State of the Union address, he said he felt like he was \u201cAlice in Wonderland.\u201d The \u201cpresident described facts that have no bearing on reality.\u201d\n\nDespite the Washington environment, Cruz is optimistic because his travels reveal \u201cpeople are waking up across the country.\u201d\n\n\u201c2016 will be an election like 1980,\u201d he says. \u201cWe win by drawing a line in the sand. There is a better path for this country. Back to the free market principles and constitutional liberties that have made America the best country in the world.\u201d\n\nSenator Cruz\u2019s Facebook page is here and his Twitter is here.\n\nMrs. Thomas does not necessarily support or endorse the products, services or positions promoted in any advertisement contained herein, and does not have control over or receive compensation from any advertiser.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Ginni Thomas", "description": "Cruz: Republican Leaders Are Divorced From The American People", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Democrat strategist James Carville once called Ted Cruz the \u201cmost talented and fearless candidate he has seen in 30 years.\u201d     Arriving in Washington in 2012, the Texas senator has proved a quick", "title": "Cruz: Republican Leaders Are Divorced From The American People", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2015/02/15/cruz-obama-doesnt-have-the-courage-to-call-out-radical-islam/", "image": {"width": 1095, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/456137960-e1450849409936.jpg", "height": 342}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Cruz: Republican Leaders Are Divorced From The American People", "title": "Cruz: Republican Leaders Are Divorced From The American People Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2015/02/15/cruz-obama-doesnt-have-the-courage-to-call-out-radical-islam/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/456137960-e1450849409936.jpg"}, "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-02-15 10:31:37", "sailthru.title": "Cruz: Republican Leaders Are Divorced From The American People", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "sailthru.tags": "ginni-thomas", "sailthru.description": "Democrat strategist James Carville once called Ted Cruz the \u201cmost talented and fearless candidate he has seen in 30 years.\u201d     Arriving in Washington in 2012, the Texas senator has proved a quick", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/456137960-e1450849409936.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe112c\"", "article_summary": "Senate Republican leaders, not objecting to more spending, more debt, wanted to \u201ckick the can down the road.\u201d Cruz reports GOP leaders asked all their senators to affirmatively consent to lower the threshold from 60 to 50 votes.\nCruz said he wasn\u2019t surprised when President Obama audaciously demanded Congress raise the government credit card limit without any spending reforms.\nThe Texan thinks the only way to change what Pat Caddell is talking about is for the American people to rise up.\nCruz is most proud of his efforts to stop the train wreck that is Obamacare.\nAs he travels around the nation, he hears of lost health care coverage, lost jobs, and rising premiums."}
