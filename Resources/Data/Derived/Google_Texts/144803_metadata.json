Moses Webber, who ran mills in both Biddeford and Manchester, N.H., founded Webber Hospital in 1899, which later became Southern Maine Medical Center; Sanford mill owner George Goodall started Henrietta D. Goodall Hospital in 1928.\n\nEd McGeachey, president and chief executive officer of Southern Maine Medical Center, lives in Saco and has worked in the area for 43 years.\n\nHe said the merger would help both hospitals provide services more cost efficiently, and reduce overhead and administrative expenses.\n\n\u201cIt will also help stabilize health care services in Sanford, which has been blessed with a lot of services in that community,\u201d McGeachey said.\n\nAfter the merger, McGeachey will be president and chief executive officer of the Southern Maine Health Center. Patsy Aprile, currently president and chief executive officer of Goodall Hospital, will be chief operating officer for the center\u2019s Sanford campus.\n\nLeslie Roberts, marketing and communications director for Southern Maine Medical Center said, \u201cSome positions may be eliminated, although we do not anticipate this to be significant and we are doing everything we can to provide affected employees with other opportunities within the organization,\u201d Roberts said.\n\nSouthern Maine Health Center will be the largest health care provider and employer in York County with 174 primary physician providers from Southern Maine Medical Center and 69 general physicians from Goodall Hospital.\n\nMcGeachey said a new board of trustees has been formed, comprised of 10 trustees that have been appointed by each hospital \u2013 six laypeople and four physicians.\n\nSeven of the trustees are from the Kennebunk area. The 20 trustees have staggered 10-year terms, and will oversee a $252 million operating budget and 2,200 employees; salaries will total approximately $122 million. McGeachey said 592 of those employees live in Biddeford and Saco, and 262 live in the Kennebunk area.\n\nCombined, the two hospitals offer health care services in 46 locations throughout the county, said McGeachey, including a new facility for general internal medicine at 46 Barra Road in Biddeford.\n\nThe structure will be named the Edward J. McGeachey Medical Office Building, in McGeachey\u2019s honor. Construction for the building began last month.\n\nAprile said the merger will allow for more than $5 million in savings in the birthing center alone, which will be in Biddeford. The Sanford birthing center will be closed.\n\nAprile said $3 million in renovations would be needed to keep the birthing center in Sanford open, and by consolidating those services the renovations may be avoided.\n\nDelivering birth services in one location will also save another $2.1 million. Aprile said many people in the Sanford region already go to Biddeford for birthing services.\n\nBoth hospitals will still provide emergency care, primary care and will invest in up-to-date facilities, technology and equipment, McGeachey said. The merger will also allow for an expansion of mental health services, which are \u201cneeded very badly,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to Roberts, mental health services will be expanded to the Sanford area, at first through a telemental health program, which uses telecommunications technology, such as video conferencing to provide services.\n\nAprile said the two hospitals will be referred to as the Biddeford and Sanford campuses of the Southern Maine Health Center, but select services will continue to be offered at facilities in Old Orchard Beach, Saco and Kennebunk.\n\nThe sleep labs of the two hospitals will be consolidated into one facility in Kennebunk, which will have longer hours and be open six days a week.\n\nThere are a total of four facilities in Kennebunk where various services are offered, including family medicine, pediatrics, pulmonology, gatroenterology, orthopedics, therapy and pain medicine.\n\nThere are 177 employees who work in Kennebunk, including more than 20 physicians.\n\nRoberts said some locations in Kennebunk may be consolidated, but no final decisions have been made.\n\nWalk-in care services in Kennebunk will also be provided, although no timeline has been set to do so, she added.\n\nMcGeachey said $1.5 million in cuts from sequestration, $1.6 million in cuts from state funding for outpatient care and an additional $1 million in hospital taxes levied by the state have left the hospitals with $4.1 million less in available funds \u201cfor providing the same exact services.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, free care and bad debts from patients have risen from $24 million in 2011 to $33 million in 2014, McGeachey said.\n\n\u201cWe are obligated morally, or arguably legally, to take care of anybody who walks into our office,\u201d McGeachey said.\n\nBy consolidating duplicated services and facilities, Mc- Geachey said the two institutions will literally save millions of dollars and be able to hold down the rising costs of health care. Additionally, the strengths and expertise of each hospital may be extended to help more people.\n\n\u201cFor example, Goodall has very good pain management,\u201d McGeachey said. \u201cWe can expand that to Biddeford.\u201d While both hospitals have eldercare facilities, only Sanford has long-term elder care facilities, which may also be expanded to help more people, McGeachey said.\n\nAprile said Sanford has \u201cstruggled to have some specialists available,\u201d and the merger will make specialists from Biddeford more readily available to patients in Sanford. Psychiatric services are also something that both hospitals need to invest in, she added.\n\n\u201cThere is a shortage of psychiatrists in the state,\u201d Aprile said.\n\nMcGeachey said the merger will allow Biddeford to add more primary care physicians.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t keep up with the need,\u201d McGeachey said. \u201cIt\u2019s the whole reason for the new building (at 46 Barra Road).\u201d\n\nAt the forum in Biddeford, members from the audience asked questions about the possibility of merging with York Hospital, and the effects of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.\n\nMcGeachey said, \u201cThe York Hospital is more of a part of the seacoast community \u2013 Portsmouth and Kittery \u2013 so they are conflicted. But we are having conversations.\u201d\n\nThe Affordable Care Act is federal comprehensive health reform legislation that expands insurance coverage. Individuals who do not have health insurance by March, 31 could face a tax penalty of $95 or 1 percent of their income, whichever is higher.\n\nThe penalty will increase each year through 2016. By Jan. 1, 2015, employers of 50 or more people must also provide affordable, comprehensive health insurance to their employees or face a $2,000 penalty per employee.\n\nGovernment-run health exchange marketplaces have been established for people who lack insurance or are looking for more affordable coverage. Enrollment in the health exchange opened Oct. 1 for coverage that will begin Jan. 1.\n\nAprile said, \u201cWhen you look at the numbers of free care, we are already getting people that don\u2019t have (health insurance). I believe (the Affordable Care Act) is a good thing because people will seek care.\u201d\n\nMcGeachey said people have figured out that the fine is still less than buying insurance.\n\n\u201cBuying insurance on the exchanges is still expensive, and small businesses may pay the fine instead,\u201d he said.\n\nMcGeachey said the hospitals also advocate for increasing eligibility for MaineCare services \u2013 a federal and state program that provides health coverage to low-income residents.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the right thing to do,\u201d he said.\n\nWant to comment on this story?
