Current policy holders will remain insured \u2014 at least for now.\n\nCHO made the decision after reporting third quarter losses of $18 million. Of course, by the standards of other co-ops being only $18 million in the red is impressive. New York just forced co-op Health Republic to close shop after it lost $130 million.\n\nThe only one of 23 co-ops to make a profit last year, CHO started to bleed money in 2015 because enrollees sought more medical care than expected.\n\n\u201cThe claims coming in are higher than what we anticipated, higher on a per-member per-month basis than last year,\u201d said CHO CEO Kevin Lewis told the Bangor Daily News. \u201cIt\u201ds hard to tell whether this is a new normal of whether this is a new normal of whether this is a kind of peak that will be followed by a lessening of claims and utilization.\u201d\n\nIf past is prologue the losses are likely to increase. Already 12 of the 23 co-ops have closed after losing $1.3 billion, slightly more than half of their original congressional appropriation.\n\nThe worst may be yet to come.\n\nNoted Affordable Care Act critic Betsy McCaughey told this column that, \u201cthe Maine co-op\u2019s failure this week and CIGNA\u2019s warning that it may not stay in Obamacare after 2016 are the latest signs of Obamacare\u2019s death spiral. Young healthy people are not signing up. Only a crony capitalism bailout \u2014 now being pushed by the White House and Democrats \u2014 can save the exchange.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Community Health Options, the Lewiston, Maine-based health co-op widely considered successful is discontinuing individual enrollment effective next Monday.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Another Obamacare co-op is cratering.
