His will be an active retirement, though, that will involve spending more time on his philanthropic work aimed at students of color, and perhaps even teaching.\n\n\u201cI may have to learn how to do this, but there might even be some down time along the way,\u201d said Page, one of only two NFL defensive players ever voted league MVP.\n\nIn a wide-ranging interview with The Associated Press at his office near the Minnesota Capitol, Page reflected on his legal career, the current state of the NFL and his upbringing. Sitting near reminders of the segregation era, such as a \u201cColored Waiting Room\u201d sign from a southern railroad, Page also talked about racial mistrust in the wake of the police shooting of an unarmed black man in Ferguson, Missouri, last summer.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve come a long way from that,\u201d he said of the railroad sign. \u201cBut that being said, we\u2019ve still got a long way to go.\u201d\n\nPage recalled growing up in Canton, Ohio, during the segregation era. He\u2019s been pulled over, he said, for \u201cdriving while black.\u201d He said he has had \u201cthe talk\u201d with his four children about how to stay safe when stopped by police, as his parents did with him.\n\n\u201cNothing new,\u201d he said. \u201cThose divisions have been there. They\u2019re I think more visible now simply because we live in a time when news can be broadcast instantly.\u201d\n\nPage said he\u2019d like to think he\u2019s done some good with the Page Educational Foundation, which has awarded $12 million in grants to 6,000 students of color at Minnesota post-secondary schools in the 26 years since he and his wife, Diane, founded it. He said one of the \u201cpleasant surprises\u201d has been seeing differences disappear when students of African-American, Native American, Asian and Latino backgrounds are brought together.\n\n\u201cSome days you look at the way the world is and you just want to draw the shades, lock the doors and hide. And our Page Scholars, they give you hope for the future,\u201d he said.\n\nThe roots of Page\u2019s passion for education and young people run deep. He said his parents constantly emphasized the importance of education.\n\nThe message soaked in. Page was a first-round draft pick for the Vikings out of Notre Dame in 1967. He played in all four of Minnesota\u2019s Super Bowls and was voted league MVP in 1971. He got his law degree from the University of Minnesota in 1978 while still playing. After the Vikings waived him in 1978, the eight-time Pro Bowler finished his career with the Chicago Bears.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Vikings great Alan Page plans life after state Supreme Court", "title": "Vikings great Alan Page plans life after state Supreme Court", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Vikings great Alan Page plans life after state Supreme Court", "title": "Vikings great Alan Page plans life after state Supreme Court", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/02/07/vikings_great_alan_page_plans_life_after_state_supreme_court/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/02/alan-page.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Vikings great Alan Page plans life after state Supreme Court", "title": "Vikings great Alan Page plans life after state Supreme Court", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/02/alan-page.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Steve Karnowski", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "After the Vikings waived him in 1978, the eight-time Pro Bowler finished his career with the Chicago Bears.\nAfter 22 years on the state\u2019s high court, Page is preparing for another major life change in August when he hits the court\u2019s mandatory retirement age of 70.\nPage was a first-round draft pick for the Vikings out of Notre Dame in 1967.\nIn a wide-ranging interview with The Associated Press at his office near the Minnesota Capitol, Page reflected on his legal career, the current state of the NFL and his upbringing.\n\u201cBut that being said, we\u2019ve still got a long way to go.\u201dPage recalled growing up in Canton, Ohio, during the segregation era."}
