The law\u2019s an excrescence, they will tell you. It\u2019s the big hand of government smashing a framing hammer down on the invisible hand of Adam Smith. It\u2019s socialist social policy married to misguided industrial policy.\n\nRepublican Party officials\u2014including Barbara Comstock, newly elected to Congress\u2014led \u201cHands Off My Health Care\u201d demonstrations against the law when it was being debated. They\u2019ve fulminated against it ever since. \u201cObamacare has proven that government-run health-care programs don\u2019t work well, if they work at all,\u201d wrote House Speaker Bill Howell in early January. Del. Steve Landes used that same line in a speech a few days later.\n\nSo why hasn\u2019t the GOP led an assault on the state\u2019s certificate of public need law?\n\nThe COPN law is supply-side Obamacare: top-down, command-and-control restrictions on which providers can offer which services. A certificate of public need is, essentially, a government permission slip. Without one, a Virginia doctor can\u2019t put an MRI machine in his clinic. A hospital can\u2019t build a new wing. A hospital company can\u2019t add a satellite campus. And so on.\n\nGetting such permission slips is a long and costly process. The owner of a Northern Virginia radiology practice, for example, spent five years and $175,000 asking permission to buy a new MRI machine. The state said no.\n\nOne reason the process takes so long is that competitors often fight such requests. When Bon Secours proposed the St. Francis Medical Center in Chesterfield, rival chain HCA fought it vigorously, arguing there was insufficient demand. The hospital was approved and enjoys a robust business. You\u2019d think state regulators would laugh off competitors\u2019 arguments, but sometimes they\u2019re actually taken seriously. When a Richmond radiology practice wanted to move\u2014not add, but move\u2014a radiation device to its Hanover offices, the state said no in part because Virginia Commonwealth University\u2019s Massey Cancer Center worried the project \u201ccould take some of their business.\u201d\n\nIn any other industry, the proper response to that would be: So what? If Kroger sets up across the street from Food Lion, we consider that good for consumers: They have more choice. And if they migrate from Food Lion to Kroger, that\u2019s not a bad thing. It means they\u2019re getting more utility for their grocery dollar.\n\nStudies of the COPN system around the country have confirmed what seems intuitively obvious. A joint examination by the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission found that COPN regulations hurt competition, fail to contain costs, and \u201ccan actually lead to price increases.\u201d Restricting supply raises prices? Imagine that.\n\nA reader recently offered some information that illustrates the point. One of his daughters, in Virginia, needed an MRI. \u201cThere was no discussion of cost, either by her doctor or the hospital when registering,\u201d he emailed. \u201cNor was she ever informed whether she had a choice of facility. The non-negotiated charge was $5,166.70.\u201d The reader\u2019s other daughter, who lives in Oregon, also needed an MRI around roughly the same time. Oregon has a COPN law too, but unlike Virginia\u2019s it does not restrict MRIs. The second daughter\u2019s doctor suggested she comparison shop. Her insurance company actually phoned her \u201cand offered to call area facilities and obtain quotes for her, which ranged from $800 to $3,000. . . . She went with the $800.\u201d\n\nCOPN started not because of alleged market failures, but because of actual government ones. Medicare and Medicaid used to reimburse providers on a cost-plus basis. That created a structural incentive for doctors and hospitals to do as much as possible: The more services they provided, the more profits they would reap. Rather than fix the reimbursement flaw, Congress forced the states to adopt COPN regulations, on the harebrained theory that restricting supply would help hold down costs.\n\nWhen that didn\u2019t work, Congress eventually changed federal reimbursement formulas and freed states to lift their COPN restrictions. Some did\u2014but not Virginia.\n\nA couple of years ago, two doctors denied practice opportunities by Virginia\u2019s COPN law filed suit to overturn it. They argue that it denies them equal opportunity and that it interferes with interstate commerce. (One of them wanted to expand his practice into Virginia.) Federal District Judge Claude Hilton upheld the law, on the grounds that it passes the incredibly weak \u201crational basis\u201d standard. Under that standard, a law is considered constitutional if anybody can think of any reason that conceivably might provide a rational basis for its existence.\n\nThe doctors appealed, and the Fourth Circuit sent the case back for further review. Late last month, Hilton affirmed his original ruling\u2014and the COPN law. That means the only avenue left for deregulating health care in Virginia is the legislature, which Republicans control.\n\nTo paraphrase House Speaker Howell and his colleagues, COPN has proven that government-run health-care programs don\u2019t work well, if they work at all. The question now is: What do they intend to do about it?", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://reason.com/archives/2014/11/24/how-government-red-tape-squashes-competi", "site_name": "Reason.com", "type": "article", "description": "The problem with \"certificate of public need\" laws.", "title": "How Government Red Tape Increases Health Care Costs and Strangles Free Enterprise"}, "twitter": {"site": "@reason", "description": "Ask Virginia\u2019s Republican lawmakers about Obamacare, and you can\nsee the veins in their foreheads start to throb.
