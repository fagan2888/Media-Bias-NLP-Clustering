Starting then from the founding:\n\nBrad Neely, \u201cGeorge Washington\u201d\n\nYou\u2019d think out first president would be the subject of numerous songs celebrating his wooden teeth and refusal to lie, but in fact he doesn\u2019t seem to have made much more impact on popular music than Millard Fillmore. If you can only find one Washington song, though, you could do worse than this quite NSFW effort by cartoonist Brad Neely, which presents our Founding Father as a thuggish superhero sporting multiple phalluses of doom. It does make you feel sorry for the British children, though.\n\nJohnny Horton, \u201cThe Battle of New Orleans\u201d\n\nA cheerful tribute to the military exploits of Colonel-and-later-President Andrew Jackson, complete with cruelty to gators. The song is focused on fighting against the British, though much of Jackson\u2019s campaign involved crushing the Creek nation. Later, as president, Jackson pushed through the Indian removal acts and the Trail of Tears. That\u2019s not the sort of thing you want to put in a jaunty song, though.\n\nThe Walnut Collective, \u201cJames Buchanan\u201d\n\nLittle known psych-punk outfit the Walnut Collective sling power chords while bellowing pro forma lyrics about how Buchanan had a heart of gold (he didn\u2019t) and owned slaves (he didn\u2019t do that either; he just supported slave owning on general principle). The utter lack of interest in the subject matter, underlined by images of slacker dudes drinking and partying, seems a fitting commemoration of our worst president.\n\nBest Friends Forever, \u201cMy Head in Front of Your Head\u201d\n\nIf the Shaggs performed \u201cSchoolhouse Rock,\u201d you\u2019d get something like this. Minneapolis indie pop duo Best Friends Forever assure Honest Abe that they would have put their heads in front of his head to take Mr. Booth\u2019s bullet, and made sure his kids didn\u2019t get smallpox (not necessarily in that order.) Spielberg\u2019s \u201cLincoln\u201d would have been infinitely improved if this had played over and over and over on the soundtrack.\n\nNorman and Nancy Blake, \u201cMr. Garfield\u201d\n\nPresidential assassinations generate a lot of music. This is a traditional song that turns a moment of national mourning into an extended exercise in dry, low-key humor. It does include the important historical detail that President Garfield\u2019s wife called him \u201cJames.\u201d Never know when that\u2019s going to be on an exam.\n\nCharlie Poole, \u201cWhite House Blues\u201d\n\nYet another insouciantly chipper song about presidential assassination: Poole\u2019s declaration \u201cyou\u2019re bound to die\u201d seems a good bit too sanguine to be altogether seemly. The Roosevelt doing his best here is Teddy; you can imagine him twisting his mustache and squinting that monocle to the sprightly fiddle. Bill Monroe also did a lightning bluegrass version of this tune.\n\nAnnie the Musical, \u201cWe\u2019d Like to Thank You Herbert Hoover\u201d\n\nI can\u2019t be the only one who thinks of this song every time Herbert Hoover\u2019s name is mentioned. A nicely mean-spirited counterpart to the better-known \u201cTomorrow.\u201d\n\nAttila the Hun, \u201cRoosevelt in Trinidad\u201d\n\nCalypso performer Attila the Hun (Raymond Quevedo) celebrates FDR\u2019s trip to Trinidad in 1936, managing somehow to give even the most banal campaign message lyrics (\u201ccharming and genial personality/and his wonderful urbanity/we were struck by his modest style\u201d) a pleasing lilt. Ry Cooder covered the song too, with slicker production and less assured vocals. It\u2019s not ideal, but Roosevelt was genial enough that he probably wouldn\u2019t have minded.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Neil Young, James Brown and more celebrate (or slam) our heads of state VIDEO", "title": "Rocking in the Oval Office: 17 catchy songs about presidents", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Neil Young, James Brown and more celebrate (or slam) our heads of state VIDEO", "title": "Rocking in the Oval Office: 17 catchy songs about presidents", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/02/17/rocking_in_the_oval_office_17_catchy_songs_about_presidents/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/neil_young.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Neil Young, James Brown and more celebrate (or slam) our heads of state VIDEO", "title": "Rocking in the Oval Office: 17 catchy songs about presidents", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/neil_young.jpg", "creator": "@hoodedu", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Noah Berlatsky", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Music, presidents, presidents day, songs, Video", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: Music, presidents, presidents day, songs, Video, Entertainment NewsWith George Washington\u2019s birthday coming up, it seems like a good time to reflect on our great presidents and the stirring songs devoted to them \u2014 and/or to our mediocre or terrible presidents and the silly songs devoted to them.\nThe song is focused on fighting against the British, though much of Jackson\u2019s campaign involved crushing the Creek nation.\nThis is a traditional song that turns a moment of national mourning into an extended exercise in dry, low-key humor.\nBest Friends Forever, \u201cMy Head in Front of Your Head\u201dIf the Shaggs performed \u201cSchoolhouse Rock,\u201d you\u2019d get something like this.\nJohnny Horton, \u201cThe Battle of New Orleans\u201dA cheerful tribute to the military exploits of Colonel-and-later-President Andrew Jackson, complete with cruelty to gators."}
