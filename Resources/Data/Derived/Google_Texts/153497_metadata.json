Here\u2019s betting it goes nowhere \u2014 not because of Republican opposition, but because Democrats see the dangers.\n\nPublic campaign finance would be (to steal Sen. Chuck Schumer\u2019s favorite phrase) a dagger at the throat of democracy and the state Democratic Party.\n\nStart with the former. Because the city\u2019s system has taken away election decisions from the voters and handed it to the Campaign Finance Board, which administers the public-funding program \u2014 and has arguably made the last two mayors.\n\nLook at the last race. Bill de Blasio\u2019s path to the Democratic nomination was cleared last year when the CFB shut down the campaign of the other major left-wing candidate, then-Comptroller John Liu, by refusing to release the matching funds he\u2019d qualified for. The excuse was the federal probe into Liu\u2019s past fund-raising, where some crimes plainly occurred \u2014 but the feds never linked Liu himself to any wrongdoing.\n\nLiu is an excellent campaigner and often a clever politician \u2014 and de Blasio\u2019s rise only began once he was sidelined. If the CFB hadn\u2019t quashed Liu, the split on the left might\u2019ve put Bill Thompson or Chris Quinn in the lead; at the least, a runoff would\u2019ve been far more likely. Instead, de Blasio soared to a win, passing the 40 percent line as the moderate vote split.\n\nThe CFB\u2019s move back in 2001 was even more anti-democratic. When the 9/11 attacks pushed Primary Day back two weeks, the board pretty much ordered all candidates to stop campaigning, and refused to release the funds that would\u2019ve let them.\n\nThe CFB deemed the time inappropriate for politics \u2014 but what does anyone\u2019s belief about what\u2019s \u201cappropriate\u201d in the wake of horror have to do with keeping elections clean?\n\nYes, campaigning in a city still in deep shock would have to be delicate. But a time when New York\u2019s future seemed in peril (no one knew when the next attack might come) was a vital time to talk politics.\n\nThe attack shifted every voter\u2019s priorities, every New Yorker\u2019s idea of what we need in a mayor. But thanks to the Campaign Finance Board, the candidates couldn\u2019t engage with the public about the new reality, showcasing their ideas and their personal strengths in light of the crisis.\n\nWe\u2019ll never know how the Democratic race \u2014 or the general election that Mike Bloomberg barely won \u2014 would\u2019ve turned out if Mark Green, Freddy Ferrar, Peter Vallone Sr. and Alan Hevesi had been able to address the city\u2019s drastically changed circumstances.\n\nIn short, taxpayer funding gives enormous power over elections to the mandarins who control that funding. There\u2019s no sign the board meant to choose the mayor in 2001 or 2013 \u2014 but this power is just begging for abuse, should serious partisans come to control the CFB.\n\nSpoiler alert: That may soon happen.\n\nBut first, the threat to the Democratic Party \u2014 which, here in the city, has become a dog wagged by the Working Families Party tail.\n\nThe WFP isn\u2019t just about left-wing politics: A more honest name is \u201cThe People Getting Government Money Party\u201d \u2014 since it\u2019s a coalition of 1) groups living on public grants, like ACORN and its successors, and 2) public-employee unions, whose members get paid by the city. Progressivism serves their most selfish interests, not just their highest ideals.\n\nAnd while unions and nonprofits are important parts of the Democratic coalition, they\u2019re hardly its natural rulers.\n\nThe reasons for the WFP\u2019s rise are many \u2014 but its gaming of the public-finance system is a big one. This includes its use of a secretive for-profit arm, Data and Field Services, to provide sometimes off-the-CFB\u2019s-books help to its chosen candidates. The well-organized party\u2019s ability to guarantee a solid level of donations \u2014 which then get matched 6-to-1 by the taxpayers \u2014 is another huge boost.\n\nFounded in 1998, the WFP now routinely picks the Democratic primary winner at all levels in city politics (and thus usually the winner in November, too). It plainly commands the first loyalty of three of the top four city officials \u2014 Mayor de Blasio, Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito and Public Advocate Letitia James.\n\nAnd guess who decides who controls the Campaign Finance Board? The mayor and the speaker.\n\nAppointments are for staggered five-year terms, so de Blasio and Viverito (and hence the WFP) don\u2019t control the board that controls city politics \u2014 yet.\n\nBut a system\u2019s that\u2019s on track to hand them that power sure doesn\u2019t look like one that any loyal Democrat would want to take statewide.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "New York Post", "twitter": {"description": "The millionaires are at it again, pushing for New York state to adopt taxpayer funding of political campaigns a la New York City.
