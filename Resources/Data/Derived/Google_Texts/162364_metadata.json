Plus, the atheists are starting their Holocaust in Times Square.\n\nThe Duck Dynasty patriarch\u2019s anti-gay comments really brought out the fringe this week. Plus, Obamacare is apparently worse than anything the Nazis, Soviets, or terrorists have ever done, and poor kids should do manual labor for food.\n\nPhil Robertson: A Modern-Day Rosa Parks\n\nUnfortunately, we can\u2019t ignore the Duck Dynasty call heard \u2018round the world, especially when it\u2019s sparked so many Fringe-worthy responses. Fringe Factor favorite Bryan Fischer, of the American Family Association praised the anti-gay comments, which got the A&E reality star suspended from his show. On his Christian radio broadcast saying, Fischer said \u201cWhat we need is about 150 million Phil Robertsons out there.\u201d Meanwhile, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal wasted no time defending Robertson, a Louisianan, issuing a statement arguing that \u201cthe politically correct crowd is tolerant of all viewpoints, except those they disagree with,\u201d and \u201cIt\u2019s a messed up situation when Miley Cyrus gets a laugh, and Phil Robertson gets suspended.\u201d\n\nSarah Palin also took the opportunity to call Robertson\u2019s suspension evidence that \u201cFree speech is an endangered species.\u201d But the winning response to the Duck Dynasty brouhaha came from Ian Bayne, an Illinois Republican congressional candidate who compared Robertson to Rosa Parks. Yes, Rosa Parks. Bayne\u2019s exact words, in a fundraising email, were: \u201cIn December 1955, Rosa Parks took a stand against an unjust societal persecution of black people, and in December 2013, Robertson took a stand against persecution of Christians. What Parks did was courageous\u2026 What Robertson did was courageous too.\u201d\n\nObamacare: Worse than Nazis, Soviets and Terrorists\n\nNorth Carolina State Senator Bob Rucho thinks the Affordable Care Act is the worst thing that\u2019s happened pretty much ever. Rucho tweeted this week that Obamacare and the pen of Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, who signed the 2012 ruling solidifying the constitutionality of the law, have \u201cdone more damage to the USA than the swords of the Nazis, Soviets & terrorists combined.\u201d Rucho refused local media requests to clarify his sharp words, but responded to the backlash he received on Twitter with, \u201cThose that tweeted, put your thinking caps back on: \u2018The PEN is mightier than the SWORD.\u2019 Edward Bulwar-Lytton, 1839. But surely you knew that.\u201d\n\nAtheist Ad Could Spark Christian Holocaust\n\nSpeaking of Nazis, New York State Sen. Andrew Lanza of Staten Island fears that an atheist group\u2019s Times Square billboard arguing that nobody needs the \u201cChrist\u201d in Christmas, is the kind of \u201creligious persecution\u201d that led to the Holocaust. Granted, the billboard is intentionally infuriating. But Lanza is so offended that he\u2019s calling for a boycott of Times Square and for American Atheists, the group that posted the billboard, to have its nonprofit status revoked. \u201cWe will not be silenced or smeared by a bigoted elected official, nor will we allow our members and other tens of millions of American atheists to be slandered by a representative of our own government,\u201d said David Silverman, the group\u2019s president in a statement affirming that the billboard won\u2019t be going anywhere until after Christmas.\n\nPoor Kids Should Sweep the Cafeteria for Their Lunch\n\nTaking a page from fellow Georgian Newt Gingrich, who suggested poor children should work as school janitors, Peach State Rep. Jack Kingston wants to teach kids a lesson about money by making them do manual labor for their food. Kingston told a local Republican Party group that paying for low-income kids\u2019 school lunches is getting too expensive and suggested that the children themselves \u201cpay a dime, pay a nickel to instill in them that there is, in fact, no such thing as a free lunch? Or maybe sweep the floor of the cafeteria\u2026\u201d\n\nRand Paul Backs Secessionist-Linked, Public Education-Hating Candidate", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "CEDickson"}, "keywords": "Rand Paul, u.s. poli, Obamacare, Sarah Palin", "publicationDate": 201312221145, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "description": "This country needs 150 million more reality stars with the courage to stand up against persecution.
