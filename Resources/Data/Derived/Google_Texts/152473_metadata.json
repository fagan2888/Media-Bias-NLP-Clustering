(WNCN)\n\nDURHAM, N.C. (WNCN) \u2013 Republican Sen. Thom Tillis was back in North Carolina Friday, and WNCN was with him for a tour of Duke Children\u2019s Hospital.\n\nHe met patients and heard from doctors about the care they provide \u2013 and what it takes to treat children.\n\nHe had met a doctor during an event in D.C. and promised to come tour.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no replacement for going out and seeing how investments and research, investments in cures and treatments are actually impacting peoples\u2019 lives,\u201d Tillis said. \u201cIt makes me a better Congressman, somebody that can go up there and advocate for increased NIH funding, the kinds of things we need to do to accelerate the pace of finding cures and treatments for children and adults.\u201d\n\nFriday\u2019s visit was Tillis\u2019 second to Duke. He\u2019s also visited UNC.\n\nHe says the partnerships the two universities have in research help their chances for getting federal funding.\n\nTillis said he has not spoken with Republican candidate Donald Trump.\n\nHe said he was with other candidates \u2013 senators Marco Rubio, Lindsey Graham, Ted Cruz and Rand Paul \u2013 Thursday night during a budget vote and was struck by how well they get along.\n\nHere is Tillis on other topics:\n\nOn Republican candidate Donald Trump:\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve got a good slate of candidates. I for one think that any of them are a better alternative to Secretary [Hillary] Clinton and we\u2019re in the primary phase where I tell everybody out there, \u2018Put on the jersey of your favorite player, get through the primary and then put on the jersey of the nominee,\u2019 because I actually think it\u2019s really important that we turn the nation in a different direction and I don\u2019t see Hillary Clinton doing that.\u201d\n\nOn possible executive action by President Barack Obama on gun control:\n\n\u201cI would say to the president that what we need to do is to come up with thoughtful, not reactionary, policies and to my way of thinking, executive action he would take would probably be as questionable constitutionally as some of the other action he\u2019s taken. We\u2019ve got to work and collaborate and come to a good solution, not an over-reaction or something that seems to take advantage of a political mood.\u201d\n\nHe said there needs to more of a focus on mental illness.\n\n\u201cI think that we need to be sure to look at some of the root causes of the more notable events that people react to and the root cause of many of these things is mental illness,\u201d Tillis said. \u201c\u2026 I don\u2019t know if you can anticipate something that happened like in Paris and San Bernardino, absent intelligence information, but I think if we spend more time, if you take a look at many of the other ones that weren\u2019t necessarily terrorist inspired, workplace violence inspired, and even those tend to have a root back less into the gun control issue and more into the mental health issue, which is an issue in North Carolina and across the country.\u201d\n\nOn wanting to repeal Obamacare:\n\n\u201cWe need to solve the problem that existed with healthcare,\u201d Tillis said. \u201cWhat the Affordable Care Act has done is create a new set of problems. I mean, we have increased healthcare costs. We\u2019ve had 147 percent increases in premiums over time here. We\u2019ve seen job losses. We\u2019re going to see more because a lot of people don\u2019t realize that the Affordable Care Act\u2019s not completely implemented.\n\n\u201cWhen the other taxes and mandates go into place, I think fewer people \u2013 more people may have healthcare and that they have a policy \u2013 many of them won\u2019t be able to use it because they simply can\u2019t afford the co-pays and the out of pocket expenses. So, we need to get to a point to where we get back to solving the problem for the people who had legitimate issues \u2013 preexisting conditions, the children on their parent\u2019s policies until the age of 26, transportability policies. Those things can be accomplished without the Affordable Care Act. Once you do that \u2013 let\u2019s go and find out who else needs help.\u201d\n\nOn Gov. Pat McCrory\u2019s re-election bid and the questions about his admnistration\u2019s prison contracts with a Charlotte company:\n\n\u201cI think Gov. McCrory\u2019s done a great job and I think what we need to do is remind people of the mess that we found the state in in 2011 and it\u2019s quite a bit different today in terms of our economic competitiveness in the Southeast.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s done a number of good things. I think this is the time of year where people try to shift a disproportionate amount of focus on things that on the whole pale in comparison to all the good that\u2019s done, whether there\u2019s a legitimate argument or not. But, this is the political season and people are going to take political shots.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to do everything I can to get my friend, the governor, re-elected.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "[anvplayer video=\"740673\"] DURHAM, N.C.
