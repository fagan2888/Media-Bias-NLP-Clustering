The Saturday evening launch of what the officials said was presumably a submarine-launched ballistic missile took place near the North Korean coastal town of Sinpo, where analysts have previously detected efforts by the North to develop submarine-launched ballistic missile systems.\n\nA successful test from a submarine would be a worrying development because mastering the ability to fire missiles from submerged vessels would make it harder for outsiders to detect what North Korea is doing before it launches, giving it the potential to surprise its enemies.\n\nSouth Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement that the projectile fired by the North on Saturday traveled about 30 kilometers (19 miles). It said a typical submarine-launched ballistic missile can travel at least 300 kilometers (186 miles).\n\nThe North last test-launched a submarine-launched ballistic missile on Dec. 25, but that test was seen as failure, the Joint Chiefs of Staff said.\n\nNorth Korea has recently sent a barrage of missiles and artillery shells into the sea amid ongoing annual military drills between the United States and South Korea. Pyongyang says the drills are a preparation for an invasion of the North. The firings also come as the North expresses anger about toughened international sanctions over its recent nuclear test and long-range rocket launch.\n\nNorth Korea's belligerence may also be linked to a major ruling party congress next month meant to further cement leader Kim Jong Un's grip on power. Promoting military accomplishments could be an attempt to overshadow a lack of economic achievements ahead of the Workers' Party congress, the first since 1980.\n\nWhile South Korean experts say it's unlikely that North Korea currently possesses an operational submarine that can fire multiple missiles, they acknowledge that the North is making progress on such technology.", "article_metadata": {"description": "South Korean defense officials say North Korea has fired what appeared to be a ballistic missile from a submarine off its northeast coast, Pyongyang's latest effort to expand its military might in the face of pressure by its neighbors and Washington", "author": "Associated Press", "og": {"site_name": "Daily Herald", "description": "South Korean defense officials say North Korea has fired what appeared to be a ballistic missile from a submarine off its northeast coast, Pyongyang's latest effort to expand its military might in the face of pressure by its neighbors and Washington", "title": "Seoul: N.
