A new organization of moms, though, say that\u2019s not enough. They are rallying to get Amendment 2 passed in November. It would legalize a broader spectrum of medicinal marijuana. Friday afternoon, the CannaMoms will be part of a Cannabis business conference in Tampa.\n\nClick here to listen to the story\n\nJacel Delgadillo says her three-year-old son Bruno sometimes has up to 300 seizures a day.\n\nHe has Dravet syndrome -- a severe form of epilepsy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s 24 hours,\" she says. \"I put him to sleep next to me I have to hold his hand or his leg because he\u2019s constantly seizing.\u201d\n\nHe requires constant care from Delgadillo -- a former teacher and single mom from Miami.\n\nShe also has a eight-year-old daughter.\n\nShe says doctors -- have tried everything. Last year they decided to try Potassium Bromide -- a veterinary drug.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s taken all of the medication available for Dravet Syndrome,\" she says, \"and they haven\u2019t helped him at all.\"\n\nShe can\u2019t know its true effects -- Bruno doesn\u2019t speak or communicate -- and there\u2019s not much she can read about it either.\n\n\u201cHonestly, I am not really quite sure for the side effects, because when I look it up I have to read on the point of view of an animal,\" says Delgadillo.\n\nShe\u2019s part of a group of Florida moms with sick kids pushing for a different option: Medical marijuana.\n\nThey call themselves -- the CannaMoms.\n\n\u201cI joined the CannaMoms because we were desperate mothers trying to save our children.\u201d\n\nThey tell their stories at conventions like this one in Boca Raton -- and in front of legislative committees.\n\nThey want to spread the word that Charlotte\u2019s Web is limited in what it can do.\n\nCannaMom Moriah Barnhart gives her three-year-old daughter Dahlia cannabis for aggressive brain cancer.\n\n\u201cEven for epileptic patients -- most of them have had to add either THCA or THC into their child\u2019s regimen,\" says Barnhart.\n\nThe Cannamoms want that option in Florida.\n\nAfter Dahlia\u2019s diagnosis in December, Barnhart moved from Tampa to Colorado, because Dahlia could get injections of cannabis oil there.\n\n\u201cShe almost immediately was no longer at risk for having to have a feeding tube put in, she got her appetite back in fact started gaining weight while on chemotherapy for brain cancer -- which is pretty much unheard of, especially in pediatric patients,\" Barnhart says. \"She was taken off of all of her antiemetics for nausea and vomiting, appetite stimulants, Neurontin for neuropathy pain, morphine for generalized pain.\u201d\n\nBarnhart says Dahlia\u2019s tumor is shrinking, -- and she attributes that to the cannabis.\n\nThey came back to Tampa in June, after lawyers said Barnhart could continue her daughter\u2019s treatment under Florida\u2019s medical necessity defense.\n\nShe wants to be here to fight for Amendment 2.\n\n\u201cShe gets up every morning happy to be alive,\" she says, \"and to see her have all of that ripped from her and to be able to give it back to her means more to me as a mother than anything I\u2019ll ever witness with my own eyes for the rest of my life.\u201d\n\nCannaMom Renee Petro\u2019s 12-year-old son Branden has a seizure disorder known as F.I.R.E.S.\n\nShe wants to get him off the medications he\u2019s been on for the last four years -- she says they cause hallucinations and depression.\n\n\u201cHe actually asks to commit suicide,\u201d she says.\n\nShe\u2019s been giving him cannabis oil because she heard it can help wean him off the prescription drugs.\n\nBecause of that, she says, the Hillsborough County Sheriff\u2019s Office Child Protective unit visited her home.\n\n\u201cBut I let them in, because I\u2019m not hiding anything.\u201d\n\n\"They came in, asked some questions, and left. Petro hired a lawyer and says she hasn\u2019t been contacted since.\n\nBarnhart says that's the kind of incident that scares those who could benefit from medical marijuana -- and one reason they must share their stories.\"\n\n\u201cEveryone would be as compassionate as us if they really, really understood,\" she says, \"and that\u2019s our job.\"\n\nThe CannaMoms say that\u2019s the kind of thing that will scare people who could benefit from marijuana. It's one reason they'll continue to fight for medical marijuana -- between now and November.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "In June, the state legislature legalized an oil form marijuana called Charlotte\u2019s Web for medicinal use.It doesn\u2019t have a lot of THC - the substance that", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/moms-rally-legalize-medical-marijuana-their-kids", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/shared/npr/styles/medium/nprshared/201408/342559166.png", "type": "article", "description": "In June, the state legislature legalized an oil form marijuana called Charlotte\u2019s Web for medicinal use.It doesn\u2019t have a lot of THC - the substance that", "title": "Moms Rally to Legalize Medical Marijuana - For Their Kids"}, "wordCount": 901, "twitter": {"site": "@HealthNewsFL", "card": "summary"}, "author": "Sam Luvisi of WLRN", "org_id": 671, "dc": {"title": "Moms Rally to Legalize Medical Marijuana - For Their Kids"}, "nid": 7572, "datePublished": "2014-08-22", "story_id": 342296202, "keywords": "medical marijauna, Charlotte\\'s Web, Amendment 2", "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdc1b\"", "article_summary": "She\u2019s part of a group of Florida moms with sick kids pushing for a different option: Medical marijuana.\nIt's one reason they'll continue to fight for medical marijuana -- between now and November.\nIt would legalize a broader spectrum of medicinal marijuana.\n\u201cEveryone would be as compassionate as us if they really, really understood,\" she says, \"and that\u2019s our job.\"\nBarnhart says that's the kind of incident that scares those who could benefit from medical marijuana -- and one reason they must share their stories.\""}
