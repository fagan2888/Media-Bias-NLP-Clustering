Tasha Ewing was just doing her job, delivering letters for the United States Postal Service, when she helped solve a crime. Walking the streets, mail in hand, she noticed an open garage door, a suspicious vehicle, and broken glass.

She called 911 and gave a description of the suspects and their vehicle. She’d been on the job only five months, but her quick thinking in May helped Aurora police apprehend the suspects, now under investigation for a series of similar crimes.

On Wednesday, Ewing received a special “Community Hero” award from Deputy Postmaster Ron Stroman and interim Aurora Police Chief Terry Jones.

“Because letter carrier Ewing recognized something out of the ordinary, and took the time to report it to police, she greatly assisted us with the apprehension of three burglars and a car thief,” Jones said in a statement. “Actions such as hers contribute to the betterment of the City of Aurora, making it a safe place to live for its citizens.”
