Prosecutors: Woman stole $1M from beer distributor, gambled it away

A former employee at a west suburban beer distributor stole $1 million from the business, then gambled most of it away at local casinos, according to prosecutors.

Kinga Jakubowski, 41, was general manager at European Beer Importers in Melrose Park when the scheme started in January 2011, according to the Cook County state’s attorney’s office.

She had worked for the company for 14 years, and was responsible for overseeing day-to-day operations, collecting payments and making bank deposits.

Over a period of about 18 months, Jakubowski pocketed $950,000, then falsified invoices to make it look like the money had been properly deposited into the business’ operations account, according to prosecutors.

Prosecutors claim she used much of the stolen money to gamble at area casinos.

Jakubowski is also accused of funneling another $94,000 through a dormant company account, then using it to issue herself checks that she later cashed and deposited into her personal accounts.

The Park Ridge resident was arrested Wednesday and charged with one count of theft by deception, a class X felony, the state’s attorney’s office said.

Judge Carol Kipperman ordered her held on a $500,000 bond at a hearing Thursday at the Maywood courthouse. Jakubowski will next appear in court April 24 for a preliminary hearing.
