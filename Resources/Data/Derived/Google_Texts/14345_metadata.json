Kelly Ayotte: Putin is a bully who needs to be \u2018punched in the nose\u2019\n\nSen. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.) referred to Russian President Vladimir Putin as a bully that the United States needs to punch in the nose \u2014 economically \u2014 during an interview on Sunday.\n\nAyotte, who was in Ukraine at the time of the interview leading a Congressional delegation, told Face the Nation host Bob Schieffer that the U.S. needs to send a message to Vladamir Putin that his actions against Ukraine are not acceptable. Ayotte recommended providing assistance to Ukrainian military forces and placing stronger sanctions on Russia.\n\n\u201cUnderstand who he is \u2014 a former KGB colonel,\u201d she said of Putin. \u201cHe\u2019s a bully, and bullies only understand when we punch them in the nose, and we need to do that economically. That is our strongest move at this point.\u201d\n\nAyotte said she appreciates the President Barack Obama\u2019s recent action, but there is still more that she wants to see happen to help Ukraine.\n\n\u201cI think we need to do more with sanctions, including sanctioning the entire financial sectors of the Russian economy, as well as looking at the energy sectors,\u201d she said.\n\nBeing that Russia is extremely focused on natural gas and oil \u2014 a \u201cone-trick pony,\u201d the Senator said \u2014 Ayotte noted that tougher sanctions on energy will send Putin a message. Along with economic restrictions, Ayotte recommended providing technical and communication assistance to the Ukrainian military. But the New Hampshire Senator emphasized that there wouldn\u2019t be a deployment of U.S. or NATO troops.\n\nLater this week, the Senate will vote on an economic aid package for Ukraine, something Ayotte strongly urged her fellow Senators to pass.\n\nDuring Ayotte\u2019s Sunday morning interview, she noted that Ukrainians were lining up in the streets behind her in protest of the Russian occupation of Crimea.\n\n\u201cThis is a Russian protest by Ukrainians who want their sovereignty,\u201d she said. \u201cThey want their freedom and they\u2019re protesting what Russia did in Crimea.\u201d\n\nCrimea is a primarily pro-Russian part of Ukraine and an area that was formerly under Soviet ownership. More than half of its population considers themselves Russian, and the peninsula has been argued over since the collapse of the Soviet Union. In a recent vote, 97 percent of Crimeans said they would like to rejoin Russia.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Sen.
