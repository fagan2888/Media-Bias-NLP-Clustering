UNITED KINGDOM – Ten-year-old Golden Retriever Martha was with her owner on Leasowe shore on Wednesday when they were caught out by the strength of the outgoing tide.

‘Martha’ the golden retriever was rescued by crew from New Brighton lifeboat station as she was being swept out to sea.

“When both crafts reached the scene and after a search we eventually found the dog about half a mile from shore being rapidly swept out to sea on the outgoing tide,” said senior helmsman Dave Lowe.

“Although sea conditions were calm it was still very difficult to spot the dog. When we eventually found her we just managed to get hold of her collar then got her onto the lifeboat.”

“Even though she had been swimming well she was cold and shivering, we wrapped her up in survival bag and calmed her down then took her to the lifeboat station where we were met by her very relieved owner,” said Lowe.
