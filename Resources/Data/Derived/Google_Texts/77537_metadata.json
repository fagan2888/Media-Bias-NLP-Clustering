But to cite his own line, \u201cwe don\u2019t have a country\u201d when a nominee for President refuses to release his taxes. Why? Because in 1972, when the elected Vice President plead no contest to tax evasion and the elected President\u2019s returns were being audited; the country clearly decided it did not want criminals in charge of its government, the world\u2019s highest office.\n\nTrump does not get the idea of standards. Paying taxes properly shows a standard of responsibility, without the excuse of government \u201cthrowing money down the drain.\u201d Trump believes there are no standards he cannot bend; is it also true of his taxes?\n\nThe nine Chairs of House committees who endorsed him certainly gave him soft vetting and demonstrated their lack moral integrity and the absence of character strength in this doyens of democracy by their recent announcement: \u201cThis great nation cannot endure eight more years of Democrat-control of the White House. . . It is paramount that we . . . maintain control of both the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate.
