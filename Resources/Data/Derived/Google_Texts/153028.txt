Two drivers died early Sunday in Dallas after colliding with trees. The two crashes occurred in Northeast Dallas and West Oak Cliff.

In Northeast Dallas, a 31-year-old man was killed after he struck a tree around 1:47 a.m. at Amesbury Drive and Southwestern Boulevard. Police say speed may have been a factor.

The Dallas County Medical Examiner’s office identified the man as Steven Eddie Phillips of Dallas.

In West Oak Cliff, a 26-year-old driver was headed east in the 2800 block of West Kiest Boulevard, near South Westmoreland Road around 2:30 a.m. Police say his car went up and over the curb of the center median.

When he tried to get off the median, police say the car rotated, went up a curb and sidewalk and struck a tree. The tree damaged the rear of the car and caused it to ignite. The car continued to move and struck two other trees.

The Dallas Medical Examiner’s office has identified the driver as Luis Renteria.

Police say Renteria was ejected from the car. He was pronounced dead at the scene.

A passenger was taken to Methodist Dallas Medical Center with possible internal injuries, police say. The passenger’s name has not been released.
