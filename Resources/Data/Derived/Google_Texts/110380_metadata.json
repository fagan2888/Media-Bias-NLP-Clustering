Many families have set up so-called special needs trusts, allowing them to set aside unlimited sums for a child\u2019s expenses not covered by government disability benefits.\n\nHowever, families must spend a few thousand dollars for a lawyer to set up a special needs trust, and the trust doesn\u2019t have the automatic tax advantages of a 529 plan, says Chris Chen, a financial planner in Waltham, Mass.\n\nAn ABLE account, he says, will be more cost-effective, particularly for small contributions.\n\n\u201cFor many middle-income Americans, it\u2019s a great thing. A lot of literature around special needs trusts assumes you are able to contribute a lot of money,\u201d Chen says. \u201cThat is not the case for most people.\u201d\n\n>> Get discounts on financial services with your AARP Member Advantages.\n\nAdvocates lobbied for eight years for passage of this legislation. With an ABLE account, families will be able to set aside thousands of dollars to be used to enhance the life of a beneficiary without losing valuable federal assistance.\n\nAs with 529 college plans, if the money in the ABLE account is used for nonqualified expenses, the earnings will be subject to regular income tax and a 10 percent penalty.\n\nABLE accounts will have some other limitations that don\u2019t apply to college 529 plans:\n\nThe accounts will be available only to those whose disability occurred before the age of 26. The account can\u2019t be used by someone, say, who develops dementia late in life.\n\nA person can be a beneficiary of only one account. And no matter how many family members contribute to it, the most that can be salted away each year in the account is equal to the annual gift tax exclusion \u2014 currently $14,000.\n\nThose whose account balances exceed $100,000 will see a suspension of Supplemental Security Income, though not Medicaid. Once the balance falls below $100,000, SSI benefits will resume.\n\nBeneficiaries must belong to their home-state plan. If there isn\u2019t one, they can participate in another state\u2019s ABLE program if both states have agreed.\n\nMoney left over in the account after the beneficiary dies could be claimed by the state to recoup expenses paid by Medicaid.\n\n>> Sign up for the AARP Money newsletter\n\nABLE accounts can be established starting in 2015, although it\u2019s up to states whether they do so. Some, such as Pennsylvania, Maryland and California, are already looking at setting them up, says Priceman of the National Down Syndrome Society.\n\nStates will be able to impose their own additional rules for ABLE accounts, as they do now with 529 college plans. About half the states, for instance, give residents a tax deduction for contributing to their home-state 529 plan. And states limit total lifetime contributions to 529s, in some cases maxing out at $350,000.\n\nThis expansion of the 529 program is only fair, Priceman says. Parents have long been able to use 529 accounts to save for a child\u2019s education. Yet if they also have a child with a disability who is not going to college, they haven\u2019t had a similar tax-favored way of saving for that child\u2019s future, he says.\n\nThey will now, with ABLE.\n\nPhoto: Karelnoppe/iStock\n\nAlso of Interest\n\n\n\nSee the AARP home page for deals, savings tips, trivia and more.", "article_metadata": {"page_title": "blog", "twitter": {"description": "Tax-friendly 529 savings plans no longer will be just for college.
