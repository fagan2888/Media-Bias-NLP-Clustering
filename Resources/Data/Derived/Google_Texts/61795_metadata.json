Sure. With Terrell Suggs coming off the edge, aiming for 39-year-old Peyton Manning, how could it not be?\n\n\u201cReally, it\u2019s about Evan, right? Evan\u2019s played more football than anybody on that offensive line,\u201d Kubiak said. \u201cIf there\u2019s anyone up front who\u2019s the most experienced, it\u2019s him, even though he hasn\u2019t been working with us.\u201d\n\nThe danger in starting a line that has yet to work together when the clock is ticking and the games matter was, perhaps, unavoidable. It\u2019s rare to have a player of Mathis\u2019 caliber still available on the open market so late in the preseason. But his delayed arrival guaranteed him zero game action and a month of cramming to learn the playbook.\n\n\u201cA lot of guys got a break around here,\u201d Kubiak said, \u201cbut he\u2019s been hanging out with the coaches quite a bit.\u201d\n\nAnd so they begin anew. Again.\n\nThe line dance in Denver has become a common story line in recent seasons. Last year, six players changed positions, resulting in three different right tackles. Through it all, the Broncos allowed only 17 sacks and 42 quarterback hits, both league lows.\n\nThis preseason, the Broncos\u2019 line sported two rookies on the left in tackle Ty Sambrailo and guard Max Garcia, a former practice-squad player at center in Matt Paradis, and Vasquez and fellow veteran Ryan Harris on the right. In four games, the Broncos allowed only eight sacks, but the line, according to Pro Football Focus, was blamed for giving up only one, tied for the fewest in the NFL.\n\nThe latest iteration of the line is nothing to scoff at \u2014 on paper. In the long term, landing Mathis could prove to be a boon for the Broncos. But to start, experimenting on the fly may be necessary.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the learning curve for cohesion is going to be a problem,\u201d Mathis said. \u201cIf there\u2019s an issue, or potential issue, we\u2019ll be able to talk that out (in practice). It might be a small adjustment \u2014 a step here, a hand there. If there\u2019s something we haven\u2019t seen and it becomes an issue, then we learn from it and keep going.\u201d\n\nTogether, the five starters average 27.8 years of age and 4.6 years of NFL experience. But the latter is one that can\u2019t be overlooked, especially for Mathis, as he and the line start over.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of overlap for me,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen, schematically, versions of everything that we do at one point in my career, whether it be in college or the many offenses I\u2019ve played in in the pros. Earlier in my career, this would have been something that probably would have been very overwhelming to me. But at this point, there\u2019s confidence and a sense of urgency just to get it done.\u201d\n\nNicki Jhabvala: njhabvala@denverpost.com or twitter.com/nickijhabvala", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Evan Mathis changes dynamic as Broncos prepare for their opener", "title": "Evan Mathis changes dynamic as Broncos prepare for their opener", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/09/07/evan-mathis-changes-dynamic-as-broncos-prepare-for-their-opener/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150907__evan-mathisp1.jpg", "height": 513}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150907__evan-mathisp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-07T19:10:46+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T18:15:36+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce6c7\"", "article_summary": "Evan\u2019s played more football than anybody on that offensive line,\u201d Kubiak said.\nIn retooling their offensive line once again, the Broncos placed a premium on knowledge and experience in exchange for game action.\nIt\u2019s rare to have a player of Mathis\u2019 caliber still available on the open market so late in the preseason.\n\u201cIf there\u2019s an issue, or potential issue, we\u2019ll be able to talk that out (in practice).\nBut the latter is one that can\u2019t be overlooked, especially for Mathis, as he and the line start over."}
