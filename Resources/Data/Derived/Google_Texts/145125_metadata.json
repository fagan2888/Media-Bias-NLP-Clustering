Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) revealed Wednesday he's been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease.\n\n\u201cOver 1 million Americans have Parkinson\u2019s and I am one of them,\" Isakson said in a statement.\n\nIsakson said he was diagnosed with Parkinson's in 2013 by a neurologist he had been regularly visiting since 2012, when he experienced stiffness in his left arm. (Parkinson's is a nervous system disorder that affects a person's movement.)\n\nHe said he's in the early stages of the disease and the arm stiffness \"and a slowed, shuffling gait\" are his main symptoms. Isakson said he has undergone \"rigorous\" physical therapy, does exercises twice a day and takes two medicines to help with his symptoms.\n\nIsakson on Parkinson's Diagnosis: \"Just one of life\u2019s challenges, & I\u2019m facing it head on. Ready for 2016 reelect!\" http://t.co/tJW2sPTc1y \u2014 Johnny Isakson (@SenatorIsakson) June 10, 2015\n\n\u201cWhile I am facing this health challenge head on, I have wrestled with whether to disclose it publicly. I recently shared the news with my three grown children and my senior staff a couple of months ago. Their support, along with the steadfast support of my wife Dianne, helped me to take this step today,\" Isakson said in his statement. \"In the end, I decided I should handle my personal health challenge with the same transparency that I have championed throughout my career.\"\n\nIsakson said he will continue to serve in the U.S. Senate, and noted the disease won't affect his re-election campaign.\n\n\n\n\"I am busier and have more responsibility today than ever before in my political career, and I couldn\u2019t be happier about that,\" he said.\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Scenes From Capitol Hill Scenes From Capitol Hill\n\n1 of 79 Standing With Charleston U.S. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), center, hold hands with Sherialyn Byrdsong of Atlanta, Georgia, whose husband Ricky Byrdsong was shot and killed on July 2, 1999, in Skokie, Illinois, during a news conference July 8, 2015, on Capitol Hill.
