Whether Opower gets compared to other software companies that had a great IPO run in the past 24 months, or to \u201csmart grid\u201d and \u201cclean-tech\u201d companies that serve the heavily regulated utility industry, could affect its fortunes. The company recently hired bankers to explore going public, the Wall Street Journal has reported.\n\nOn Thursday, Opower announced that it welcomed Mark McLaughlin, chairman, president and chief executive of Palo Alto Networks Inc., to its board. He\u2019s joining Marcus Ryu, chief executive of Guidewire Software Inc., and Deep Nishar, senior vice president of products and user experience at LinkedIn Corp.\u2013all having started on the board in the past few months.\n\nAll three of the companies that the new directors work with represent potential comparisons and learning opportunities for Opower. All three were also high-growth venture-backed software companies that completed successful IPOs in the past two years.\n\nPalo Alto Networks, for example, which provides security software to enterprise customers, priced its IPO in 2012 well above initial plans and then saw its shares jump on first day of trading. It currently trades at about 9.3 times sales, according to data from Capital IQ.\n\nIt\u2019s notable that in the press release announcing Mr. McLaughlin\u2019s appointment, Opower dubbed itself as a \u201ccloud software\u201d company, which appears to be the first time it referred to itself this way. It also threw in other technology buzzwords, such as \u201cbig data,\u201d a term that started cropping up in Opower\u2019s press releases starting this fall.\n\nContrast that to the way Opower characterized itself in 2009, as \u201ca leading smart-grid software company.\u201d The company\u2019s products and offerings didn\u2019t drastically change over the years, but it\u2019s self-characterization did.\n\n\u201cSmart-grid\u201d companies haven\u2019t done nearly as well in the public markets recently as have software technology plays.\n\nEnerNOC Inc., for example, a company that provides that reduces demand for electricity for commercial customers and works with utilities, trades at a price of 1.13 times sales, according to Capital IQ. Silver Spring Networks stands out in this regard \u2014 it\u2019s a venture backed smart-grid company that languished in IPO registration for many months, but did have a successful IPO earlier this year. Still, there are many fewer successes in this sector than in software.\n\n\u201cOpower has always been a software company, and that will continue to be our focus,\u201d said Carly Llewellyn, spokeswoman for the company. She declined to comment further.\n\nOpower processes loads of data, collecting reads from electronic meters from millions of homes. It sends consumers paper reports, as well as messages via text and email, where it gives them suggestions for how to decrease energy use tailored to their circumstances (they vary based on whether you own a big house or live in an apartment building). The company compares electricity usage of homeowners to that of their neighbors, creating a peer-pressure effect that leads people to save more electricity.\n\nIts business requires a good understanding of what drives consumers, know-how in data processing, as well as skills in regulatory and politics work as it sells to utilities.\n\nWhich category of companies Opower will fall under in investors\u2019 eyes will matter greatly for its IPO, as share price depends often on performance of companies considered comparable.\n\nConfusion over how to categorize the company likely cost a bit of money to SolarCity Corp. The solar project developer and financing company that went public a year ago, set its share price well below earlier estimates. At that time SolarCity was trying to differentiate itself from solar manufacturers that hurt many investors, but its CEO Lyndon Rive said then that many investors still lumped it together with those more unfortunate businesses.\n\nSolarCity shed the negative associations and is now the stock with the best post-IPO performance for the year, according to Nasdaq. (It priced at $8 and is trading at above $52.)\n\nFor Opower the challenge will be to present itself as a software-as-a-service play, and not be burdened by the fact that it sells to a notoriously difficult customer set: utilities.\n\nIn previous interviews, Jon Sakoda, board member and partner at New Enterprise Associates, one of Silicon Valley\u2019s largest venture firms, said that Opower has been growing faster than any of the firm\u2019s other software-as-a-service companies.\n\nSoftware companies that sell to a niche industry have been successful, with Guidewire among the group. That company, whose CEO is a recent member of Opower\u2019s board, went public last year and sells its products to insurance providers. It has been trading well above its IPO price.\n\nOpower sells to utilities, and it has been adding expertise in that area, as well, but by adding people to its advisory board, rather than to the board of directors.\n\nWrite to Yuliya Chernova at Yuliya.Chernova@wsj.com.
