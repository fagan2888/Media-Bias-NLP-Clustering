Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont is boldly advocating a single payer, government-run health care system as part of the basis of his campaign. But, even if he were to become president and even, to compound that miracle, he was to have a Democratic House and Senate, he would never get the idea passed into law. The Washington Examiner reported on Wednesday that none other than House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, one of the most left-wing office holders in Washington, has thrown cold water on the idea. She suggests that it is useless to even to talk about it, as Medicare for All would never pass.\n\nPhoto by Andrew Burton/Getty Images\n\nPelosi based her judgement on two salient facts.\n\nFirst, not even a Democratic Congress is going to consider raising taxes across the board. To even bring such an idea up would be to invite a political Armageddon at the hands of the Republicans.\n\nSecond, in Pelosi\u2019s view, the job of health care reform has already been done. Congress has passed Obamacare, and there is no need to revisit it to argue for a Canadian-style health care system.\n\nMind, Pelosi may be being politically tone death with that last judgement. Obamacare is wildly unpopular with Americans, with skyrocketing premiums and deductibles and people staying away from the healthcare system in droves, despite their exposure to fines for not signing up. Something has to be done about the Affordable Care Act to save the American health care system from collapsing into ruin.\n\nStill, one wonders where Sanders will go from here now that it has been shown his health care measure will never become reality. Likely he will continue to pretend otherwise, Pelosi\u2019s judgment notwithstanding.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen.
