Troy May’s request to the new Republican governor is a necessary challenge to Matt Bevin in a state that historically had poor quality of healthcare; however, Kentucky made changes to improve this important service to its citizens through Kynect (“I’m begging Bevin: Leave Kynect alone” Dec. 5).

Kynect has come at a cost, both financially and politically – given that a Democratic administration was able to implement a national plan that can be used for state health insurance exchanges versus Republicans who have had ideas about healthcare, but no actual plans. The governor wants to follow the Republican opposition to the Affordable Care Act and change Kynect.

So here is the fact-checking challenge to The Enquirer: what is the current cost-benefit to the citizens of Kentucky of having Kynect? What is the proposed cost-benefit if the governor terminates Kynect and transitions people to the federal level exchange?

John Grumbles, West Chester
