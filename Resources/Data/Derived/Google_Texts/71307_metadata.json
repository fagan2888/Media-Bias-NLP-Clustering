Here's how (Photo: Detroit Free Press)Buy Photo\n\nWhat happened in Flint? The city was broke. Gov. Rick Snyder appointed an emergency manager, with the high-minded goal of balancing the city\u2019s books. But with no new cash, the only choices were cuts. And so the EM \u2014 with the sign-off of the state\u2019s environmental regulatory agency \u2014 left the Detroit water system, thinking Flint would save money.\n\n\n\nWhat happened in Flint, where foul water still flows from taps in people\u2019s homes? There\u2019s a long chain of government responsibility. But trace that chain far enough, and you\u2019ll find Flint\u2019s problems rooted firmly in the spectacular disinvestment Michigan has visited on cities for decades.\n\nFlint\u2019s the worst iteration of Michigan\u2019s failure to care for its cities. City officials should never be looking over their books trying to find ways to save money on clean water. But those are the kinds of choices the state\u2019s strained relationship with its cities demands local governments make.\n\nThe trouble in Michigan\u2019s cities has been a slow degradation of state support \u2014 which escalated during the gubernatorial terms of John Engler and Jennifer Granholm \u2014 combined with tight restrictions on the ways cities can find revenue for themselves.\n\nCensus data shows Michigan ranks dead last over the past 10 years in municipal revenue growth and state investment in local government.\n\nThe only way to change that is to switch the policy direction, and that has to come from Lansing.\n\nState government, rather than making life harder for cities, needs to focus on ways to help cities deliver the services their citizens need without the constant specter of financial peril.\n\nTo date, Gov. Rick Snyder\u2019s administration has over-relied on limited tools like the emergency-manager law to deal with cities\u2019 troubles once they reach the level of catastrophe. But there\u2019s no long-term urban policy vision coming from the governor or anyone around him.\n\nMost Democrats, meanwhile, have been vague and sheepish about consistently articulating a better path.\n\nIf Michigan were to embrace a strategy of reinvesting in its cities, giving them the resources they\u2019d need to deliver services and balance their budgets, it would begin with three significant policy changes.\n\nFix revenue sharing\n\nHere\u2019s how Michigan cities get the funds they use to provide basic services like police and fire protection, parks and, yep, clean, safe water: Property taxes (capped by state law to the rate of inflation, crippled by the 2008 housing crash) and revenue sharing. In other words, there\u2019s a slew of taxes the state collects on behalf of, and then dispenses to, cities, via two formulas. One is a per-capita distribution enshrined in the state constitution. The other is statutory \u2014 that means the amount of money dispensed by the state is set each year by the governor and the Legislature.\n\nAnd when Michigan fell on hard times, as the recession of the early 2000s began, the state made cuts to the services it provides \u2014 but it also filched from cities, cutting statutory revenue sharing more deeply each year.\n\nHow to fix it?\n\nStop shortchanging cities.\n\n\u201cThe only thing standing in the way of funding revenue sharing is what the governor and legislature prioritize,\u201d said Tony Minghine, associate executive director and chief operating officer at the Michigan Municipal League. \u201cAnd right now they prioritize state government more than services people use every day. \u2026 Over 80% of (gross domestic product) occurs in cities, but we don\u2019t invest in those places to make them attractive.\u201d\n\nBut there are some caveats, says Eric Lupher, president of the nonpartisan Citizens Research Council.\n\n\u201cWe have gone for so long just giving governments (roughly) whatever they got the year before,\u201d Lupher said. \u201cWe need to make sure there\u2019s a rational way of distributing it to governments weighted to need.\u201d\n\nPopulation density, he said, correlates consistently with the demand on city services \u2014 that\u2019s one approach to resetting statutory revenue sharing.\n\nThere\u2019s no question that boosting revenue sharing would mean cuts at the state level. But, as Minghine notes, it\u2019s a matter of priorities, and cities have fallen at the bottom of the heap for too long.\n\nFix retirement benefits\n\nEven Michigan\u2019s most prosperous cities struggle to pay the cost of retiree health care, promises made to workers to provide health care long after they stop working.\n\nStatewide, cities are an estimated $8 billion in the hole on the projected 30-year cost of delivering this benefit.\n\nBut because of the way the cost of health care increases \u2014 outpacing the rate of inflation \u2014 budgeting for retiree health care has daunted Michigan cities. There are two ways to fund retiree health care: setting aside a sum each year sufficient to ensure benefits can be paid over the next 30 years, or paying the required sum each year. Most cities choose the latter. That\u2019s a problem, again, because of the way health-care costs balloon.\n\n\u201cWe need to think about it differently,\u201d Minghine said. \u201cHealth care has proven to be, and will continue to be, a very expensive benefit no one has real control over. ... Re-thinking how we deliver that benefit and making it applicable statewide is the only way to really change that.\"\n\nThe state, Minghine said, should mandate how cities deliver that benefit, and should explore options like a stipend-based approach that would provide solid health-care benefits, perhaps through the Affordable Care Act\u2019s health care exchanges: \"That would go a long way toward making local governments a lot more stable.\"\n\nAltering future benefits, he said, would be coupled with an influx of state cash to cities currently struggling to fund retiree health care, probably via a bond sale to fund health-care benefits for current retirees.\n\nBut, he said, the state also has to change the way cities bargain for health-care benefits: \u201cIf they\u2019re still subject to bargaining, all you\u2019re doing is resetting the clock for one day. All the same pressures that caused this benefit to get out of control start all over again.\u201d\n\nMake like a region and work together\n\nMichigan has more than 1,700 units of local government, each with its own services and employees, complicated retirement plans and other administrative costs.\n\nThat's not just too many in absolute terms. It\u2019s also detrimental because of history.\n\nMany of our divisions of government, for instance, owe their existence to racial and economic divides that sow current animosities.\n\nAnd the combination of hyper-local government and federal policies that discouraged investment in urban centers has created the economic chasms that have swallowed up cities like Flint and Detroit, while wealthier suburbs thrived.\n\nBig cities in Michigan would inarguably benefit from a stronger emphasis on regional governance by dealing smaller suburbs into the mix. Solidifying the common destinies of cities and their suburbs in governmental structure reinforces the idea of necessary cooperation.\n\nBut entire regions would benefit, too. Think of the possibilities for better transit, for instance, with fewer governmental divisions to deal with.\n\nFor some cities, this is likely to become a matter of survival. Think of a place like Wayne, for instance, a small carve-out that\u2019s sandwiched between Westland, Garden City, Romulus and Inkster.\n\nThe services it provides to its citizens, historically, were subsidized largely by personal property tax receipts from the two Ford plants that are within its borders.\n\nBut the repeal of that tax will leave Wayne, and many cities like it, with less reliable revenue. The rollback starts this year and will continue until 2023, when the tax phases out completely.\n\nWayne will need help if it is to survive as its own municipality. But what\u2019s the reason for it to be separate, as a government, from the communities around it? Services could be provided to its citizens more cheaply, especially in the long-term, if it were to outright consolidate with another city.\n\nThe hurdles to this kind of cooperation are often too high at the local level to produce any meaningful change. If you want to start a fight in Michigan, just suggest that the five Grosse Pointes should be one, or that Royal Oak Township ought to be part of Ferndale, or that Flint and Flushing Township or Grand Blanc Township ought to share a tax base.\n\nThat\u2019s where the state has to lead.\n\nGov. Snyder\u2019s administration has tried by offering small incentives to cities that share services. A more sensible policy would provide bigger carrots for cities that merge altogether, and at least contemplate penalties for places that insist on maintaining hyper-local division.\n\nState policy needs to make it clearer that regional governance is more than just a pipe dream or slogan. It should be what\u2019s encouraged, and even demanded, to keep cities in better financial health.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.freep.com/1NfRp8c", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "What happened in Flint?
