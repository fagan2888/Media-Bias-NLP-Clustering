Sentinel Adds Auto Parts, as Sector Races to Consolidate

The PE firm invests in Driven Performance Brands, the owner of B&M Racing and Performance and Flowmaster brands

Sentinel Capital Partners has acquired automotive performance parts distributor Driven Performance Brands from Dubin Clark & Co. for an undisclosed amount.

DFB, founded in 1953 and based in Santa Rosa, California, makes transmissions, exhausts and mufflers under the Flowmaster, B&M Racing and Performance, Hurst Shifters, Hurst Driveline Conversions and Dinan Engineering brands.

“DFB is an excellent platform for industry consolidation and organic growth,” says Sentinel partner Jim Coady.

Sentinel invests up to $175 million in equity in companies that have around $60 million in Ebitda. The New York-based firm is also currently invested in auto parts distributor Vintage Holdings Inc.

There has been strong deal activity in the auto parts space in 2015. Some other deals include: Aviation Industry Corp of China buying Henniges Automotive Inc.; ITT Corp.’s (NYSE: ITT) $300 million cash purchase of Wolverine Automotive Holdings Inc.; and the Riverside Co. investing in Arrowhead Electrical Products.
