Patent trolls sometimes use poorly defined or expired patents on consumer technology to extort out-of-court settlements from small businesses.\n\n[READ: White House Announces Patent Reform Actions]\n\nThe tech industry is hit particularly hard by these tactics because a program or device can each consist of many patents for the software or the parts. Patent trolls have elicited settlements from businesses like coffee shops, supermarkets and hotels because they used Wi-Fi devices allegedly protected by a patent. Web entrepreneurs are also sent threatening letters by trolls accusing them of infringing on a software patent.\n\nPresident Barack Obama called for action to prevent abusive patent lawsuits in his State of the Union address, two months after House Republicans spearheaded a 325-91 vote passing a bill aiming to protecting small businesses from being harassed by such lawsuits.\n\nThe House bill, known as the Innovation Act, sought to discourage such poorly founded lawsuits by requiring the loser of a patent case to pay the legal fees, with certain exceptions. The bipartisan bill sailed through the Republican-controlled House in December, shortly after partisan gridlock shut down the government. The momentum stalled in May when Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., withdrew his Senate version of the bill.\n\nLeahy said he was forced to drop the bill by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., according to an interview with the Vermont-based Burlington Free Press.\n\n\"I am furious with what happened,\" Leahy told the Free Press. \"We worked so hard to get a coalition. Harry Reid and a couple of others said, 'We won't let it come to the floor.' I think that's wrong, but I'm not going to give up.\"\n\nAccusations that Reid blocked Leahy\u2019s bill also came from Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, who this spring coordinated on a patent reform proposal with Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.\n\n\u201cThe majority leader basically killed that bill before it could even be acted on in the judiciary committee,\u201d Cornyn said on the Senate floor in May. \u201cAnd in the process he shut out not just Republicans but Democrats, too.\"\n\nReid's office did not respond to requests for comment.\n\n[ALSO: Bipartisan Innovation Act Clears House]\n\nThe technology industry accounted for only part of the hundreds of millions of dollars spent hoping to influence Congress on patent reform in 2013 and 2014. Some groups opposed Silicon Valley, hoping to maintain stronger lawsuit rights for patent owners. The tech lobby\u2019s failure was likely the work of such competing interests pressuring Senate leaders to block the bill, says Robert King, a patent attorney with the law firm of Hunton and Williams.\n\n\u201cThere could be plaintiff attorneys who could make money off a contingency case that trolls might bring,\u201d says King, a partner at the law firm. \u201cI would imagine that not much happens in Congress without lobbying.\u201d\n\n\n\nCourtesy of the Center for Responsive Politics\n\nClick to enlarge.

The top campaign contributors to Reid since 2009 have come from the legal sector, with health professionals listed as the fourth-largest contributing group and the computer and Internet industry trailing at 13 th place, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, which researches money in politics.\n\nCourtesy of the Center for Responsive Politics\n\nClick to enlarge.\n\nCourtesy of the Center for Responsive Politics\n\nThe number of groups lobbying on patent and copyright issues during the first few months of 2014 has already exceeded that of 2013, according to the money-tracking center, which details tech and health care interests as the top competitors. Google was the top lobbyist on patents in 2013 and so far during 2014, followed by the trade group Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, which has jumped from the fourth-most active lobbyist on the issue in 2013 to second place this year, according to the research group.\n\nDespite being beaten in the Senate by more established players, Silicon Valley lobbyists flexed their growing political muscle by running a strong public relations campaign to support the bipartisan Innovation Act. Computer and Internet companies reported spending nearly $72 million to lobby on issues including patents during the first few months of 2014, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. The year isn\u2019t even over yet, so the tech industry may surpass its 2013 lobbying record of $141 million, according to reports compiled by the center.\n\nCourtesy of the Center for Responsive Politics.\n\nClick to enlarge. Courtesy of the Center for Responsive Politics.\n\nThe tech sector's failure was a learning experience for the industry\u2019s growing lobbyist presence, which plans to push for patent reform again next year. The last major change to patent law \u2013 the America Invents Act signed by Obama in 2011 \u2013 took six years to clear Congress, so lobbying money spent so far \u201dwas definitely worth it\u201d to raise awareness about the issue, says Gina Woodworth, vice president for public policy and government at advocacy group \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bThe Internet Association.\n\n\u201cWe never went into this thinking it was a short-term strategy,\u201d says Woodworth, whose group was\u200b founded in 2012 and\u200b represents companies including Google and Facebook. \u201cSince our inception less than two years ago, this has been a high priority.\u201d\n\nCourtesy of the Center for Responsive Politics\n\nClick to enlarge.\n\nCourtesy of the Center for Responsive Politics\n\nThe upcoming 2014 elections could unseat Democrats \u2013 and Reid \u2013 from Senate leadership posts, but The Internet Association is ready for any outcome, Woodworth says. Internet Association members Google, eBay and Facebook have contributed about equally to the campaigns of both Republicans and Democrats since 2013, according to an analysis of their campaign finance reports by the Center for Responsive Politics. \u200b\n\n\u201cGetting pieces of legislation to move in the Senate is a complicated matter,\u201d Woodworth says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who is in the majority.\u201d\n\nThe Senate patent bill may face less resistance in 2015, when members are less cautious about the November elections, says King, the patent attorney. If Republicans gain a Senate majority, they may have an easier time coordinating on patent reform with leadership in the House and the Obama administration, he says.\n\n\u201cMaybe people wanted to keep a low profile during an election year,\u201d he says. \u201cPresident Obama wants to address this and he\u2019s a big proponent of patent reform.\u201d\n\nThe Internet Association plans to step up efforts to educate Congress and businesses about the need to protect small companies from abusive lawsuits, which may reassure lawmakers uncertain about the \u200bpossible consequences of revising patent law, Woodworth says.\n\n[MORE: Former Google Executive Megan Smith Named U.S. Chief Technology Officer]\n\nSome Democrats were fearful that the Innovation Act would have caused fees to be shifted onto the shoulders of people who lost cases but had a solid right to assert their patents, according to critics like Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., the top Democrat serving on the House Judiciary Committee.\n\nTo ease those fears in the Senate, advocates for the technology industry did their part to compromise during negotiations, says Peter Pappas, a senior adviser for Engine, an advocacy group for tech startup entrepreneurs. Those compromises in the Senate included agreeing to provisions that would have \u201cgiven more discretion to judges\u201d in lawsuits\u200b, and including in the bill when to require more details about patent ownership before a case is allowed in court and when to shift legal fees to the losing party of a case, Pappas says.\n\n\u201cI think tech did most of the compromising,\u201d says Pappas, a former chief of staff at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.\n\nIf enacted, the bill would have caused some unintended consequences for patent defendants, but overall the legislation created room to prevent unfair rulings, King says.\n\n\u201cMy take on it is that it doesn\u2019t really restrict anything that should not be restricted,\u201d King says. \u201cIn some local [court] districts you have to do some of this stuff anyway.\u201d\n\nDespite its defeat, Silicon Valley is growing influence in Washington and will definitely live to lobby another day, says Viveca Novak, communications director for the Center for Responsive Politics.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "picks", "title": "How the Tech Lobby Got Beat", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Silicon Valley regroups after being outmaneuvered by more established lobbyists in the Senate.", "title": "How the Tech Lobby Got Beat", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/09/16/how-the-tech-lobby-got-beat", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/83/80/00ae22ba45cd8ca47d69624829a2/140916-reid-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Silicon Valley regroups after being outmaneuvered by more established lobbyists in the Senate.", "site": "@USNews", "card": "summary", "title": "How the Tech Lobby Got Beat"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "news", "date_published": "Sept. 16, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Tom Risen,lobbying,technology,Reid, Harry,patents,campaign finance,Pulse,picks", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Silicon Valley regroups after being outmaneuvered by more established lobbyists in the Senate."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca1d7\"", "article_summary": "The year isn\u2019t even over yet, so the tech industry may surpass its 2013 lobbying record of $141 million, according to reports compiled by the center.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who is in the majority.\u201dThe Senate patent bill may face less resistance in 2015, when members are less cautious about the November elections, says King, the patent attorney.\n\u201cI think tech did most of the compromising,\u201d says Pappas, a former chief of staff at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.\n[READ: White House Announces Patent Reform Actions]The tech industry is hit particularly hard by these tactics because a program or device can each consist of many patents for the software or the parts.\nThe tech sector's failure was a learning experience for the industry\u2019s growing lobbyist presence, which plans to push for patent reform again next year."}
