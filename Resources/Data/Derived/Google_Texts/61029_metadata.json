A spokesman said higher-than-expected medical costs have hurt the cooperative.\n\nThe announcement casts further doubt on the future of the cooperatives, small nonprofit insurers devised during the ACA\u2019s creation to inject competition in insurance markets. These co-ops immediately struggled to build their businesses. A dozen of the 23 created have already folded.\n\nAn Associated Press review of financial statements from 10 of the 11 surviving co-ops shows that they lost, on average, more than $21 million in the first nine months of this year. Those losses range from $3.9 million reported by Maryland\u2019s Evergreen Health Cooperative to $50.7 million booked by Land of Lincoln Mutual Health Insurance Co. in Illinois.\n\n\u201cClearly the remaining health care co-ops are in dire circumstances,\u201d said Robert Laszewski, a health care consultant and former insurance executive who has been a frequent critic of the Affordable Care Act. \u201cI don\u2019t know how any of them can survive another year.\u201d\n\nThe state-based co-ops were seen as a fallback option by liberals who initially wanted a government-run insurer to compete with for-profit companies that control the U.S. commercial coverage market.\n\nThe cooperatives, like other health insurers, have been hit by soaring medical and prescription drug costs. Plus they\u2019ve had to spend money building a network of care providers, negotiating rates with them and then marketing their plans to customers. They have also received considerably less financial support than they expected from a federal government program designed to support insurers as the exchanges got under way.\n\n\u201cIt is probably impossible for a startup in the health insurance space to make any significant money in the first couple years,\u201d said Standard & Poor\u2019s analyst Deep Banerjee.\n\nEstablished players also have struggled to sell coverage on the ACA\u2019s state-based health insurance exchanges, which are a key element behind the law\u2019s push to cover millions of uninsured people. UnitedHealth Group Inc. recently reported deep losses from its exchange business and said it would decide next year whether to even remain in the exchanges in 2017.\n\nBut other insurers like the Blue Cross-Blue Shield carrier Anthem Inc. and Medicaid coverage provider Molina Healthcare Inc. have said they are making money off their exchange business.\n\nMaine\u2019s Community Health Options booked about $217 million in medical costs through the first nine months of this year, as its enrollment approached 71,000 people. Its costs so far this year are 72 percent higher than what the insurer recorded all of last year.\n\nSpokesman Michael Gendreau said the company decided to freeze individual enrollment for 2016 in order to ensure \u201cthat we are able to provide the same level of care and service that we provided last year.\u201d\n\nHe said the cooperative was not in danger of closing.\n\nCommunity Health Options is spending 89 percent of the premiums it collects on medical costs and claims.\n\nLaszewski, the health care consultant, said small co-ops probably don\u2019t want to spend more than 85 percent of their premiums on claims. Aside from paying claims, insurers need to collect enough revenue to run their business.\n\nEight of the 10 surviving co-ops reviewed by The Associated Press were spending 89 percent or more of their premium income on medical costs.\n\nBanerjee, the Standard & Poor\u2019s analyst, said he expects more co-ops to struggle heading into 2016, but it\u2019s hard to say how many will survive or fail.\n\n\u201cWhat it comes down to is they need to turn a profit very quickly because the funding source is drying up,\u201d he said.\n\nThe closing of additional co-ops would mean fewer insurer choices for customers shopping on the ACA\u2019s exchanges.\n\nThe exchanges are currently accepting applications for coverage that starts Jan. 1, but that enrollment period will end Dec. 15.\n\nCopyright 2016 Associated Press.
