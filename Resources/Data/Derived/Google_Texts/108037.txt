Hobby Lobby sign a clue to what's happening at old JC Penney home store

A "Coming Soon â€“ Hobby Lobby" sign was spotted this week at the site of the former JC Penney Home Store on South Virginia Street, across from Meadowood Mall.

The Penney store closed in May 2013.

No details were available Saturday from the Hobby Lobby company.

Hobby Lobby, headquartered in Oklahoma City, has been in the news lately because it has appealed a contraceptive mandate that is part of the Affordable Care Act. The U.S. Supreme Court has said it will hear that case in March.
