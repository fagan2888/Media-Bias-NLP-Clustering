People lined up outside Westmoore High School to see the scrimmage.

The Thunder announced the team is building a new basketball facility for the Moore School District.

The Oklahoma City Thunder held their annual scrimmage on Sunday, not at Chesapeake Energy Arena though.

Kevin Durant and the rest of the team took the show on the road to Westmoore High School. Victims of the May tornado were invited to watch, and they easily filled up the gym Sunday afternoon.

The Thunder also made a big announcement. They're building a new basketball facility for the Moore School District. And through its Thunder Cares Foundation, the team will rebuild courts at Briarwood Elementary, Plaza Towers Elementary, and Highlands East Junior High.
