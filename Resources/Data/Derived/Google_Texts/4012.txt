LOUISVILLE, Ky. (WDRB) -- Humana agrees to settle lawsuits filed by its own shareholders.



In a class action suit, filed in Louisville, shareholder Harold Litwin claims the merger undervalues Humana and that it unfairly compensates its stockholders, citing Aetna's falling stock prices.



Litwin also claims the company's directors have the most to gain and "violated their fiduciary responsibility" to public stockholders.



Humana announced it would settle the case, and a similar one filed in Delaware.



In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Humana added more details about the merger, including conversations detailing Aetna's intention to keep base operations in Louisville.



It is now yet known if the shareholders behind the suits will accept the settlement.
