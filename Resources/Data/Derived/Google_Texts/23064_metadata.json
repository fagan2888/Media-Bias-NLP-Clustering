'This is an awesome neighborhood and community,' she said. 'There's so much to do in the area for kids and adults.'

He just came from a party at a nursing home where his mother used to live.\n\nAvell moseys across the street from Shenanigans Irish Grille where three international students take a break from their studies to chat, eat, and sip a beer. They like the town, but add an international perspective.\n\n\"If I had kids, I wouldn't mind them living here,\" Adam Graham of Ireland said. \"[Deer Park] is kind of very stereo-typical American; from the decorating of Halloween and Christmas, to the porch swings, and the houses,\" Graham said.\n\nThrough the window at Shenanigans Irish Grille Jason Maggard, 14, and Lucas Manning, 13, walk together after the school day ends. \"One thing that really strikes me, is that if you take away the rest of Louisville, Deer Park could be a self sufficient place. Like a small town,\" Manning said.\n\nOn a nearby street, two neighbors, and long-time friends work on a heating and cooling system. Pat Lentz, a construction worker, and David Berman, a plumber, are both self-employed and use the afternoon for home improvement repairs in Berman's home.\n\n\"We trade off work,\" Lentz said. \"Just neighbors helping neighbors.\"\n\nLentz, a construction worker, said he couldn't afford a house in the Highlands when he moved to the Deer Park Neighborhood 19 years ago.\n\n\"When I couldn't afford a house here, I bought a fixer upper. Literally I had to jack it up, post footers, and termites had eaten it up. I had to change all the plumbing and electrical,\" he said.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1zMPRY8", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Through the window at Shenanigans Irish Grille Jason Maggard, 14, and Lucas Manning, 13, walk together after the school day ends. \"One thing that really strikes me, is that if you take away the rest of Louisville, Deer Park could be a self sufficient place.
