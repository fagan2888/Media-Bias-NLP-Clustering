The employees were afraid of retribution so their identities were protected.\n\nSome of the familiar allegations include one man who said he has processed about 40 health insurance applications in six months. Moreover, the Rogers office had a day and night shift to make outbound calls. An unnamed worker told Nagus they are prohibited from calling anyone after 9 and yet are required to stay on the clock until midnight.\n\n\u201cSo why even be there until midnight?\u201d Nagus asked.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said the Serco employee. \u201cGood question.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo they make the calls stop at 9, so from 9 to midnight are the callers kind of bored?\u201d Nagus continued.\n\n\u201cYeah, there\u2019s nothing going on,\u201d the employee said. He added workers were not allowed to leave early.\n\nThe Rogers, Arkansas Serco office is still hiring even though there is little work.
