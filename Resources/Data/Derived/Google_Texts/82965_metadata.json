Fred Upton's big dreams of having 100 Democrats abandon President Obama and Obamacare were not realized today, when just 39 Democrats , mostly vulnerable freshmen and the usual Blue Dog suspects, voted for his \"Insurance Company Bill of Rights\" plan, which passed 261-157. Or, as Speaker Boehner called it, a step on the road to repeal\n\nThe White House provides this quick, graphical summary of the differences between the administrative fix President Obama announced Thursday and the Upton bill.\n\n\n\nIt's that stuff on the right that's the big problem, in particular that part about how it gives insurance companies more, new customers to sell their junk policies to. The administration's fix, and the proposals put forth by House Democrats and Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-LA) would only allow existing policies to be renewed. House Democrats tried twice to put forward their plan. The first attempt, as a substitute amendment, was blocked by Republicans who resorted to some parliamentary trickery to prevent a vote on the amendment. Democrats offered it again as a motion to recommit, the last opportunity they had to change the bill, but failed 187-230. All but four Democrats voted for the proposal on this vote.\n\nThe important part of the administration's and the Democrats' plans (and why Republicans made sure that they failed) is that the contain consumer protections. They all require that insurers wanting to extend a customer's policy inform that customer of what they're missing out on by renewing this junk insurance. They would also require insurers to let the customers know how to find their other options on the health insurance exchange, and that they might be eligible for federal help paying for their new insurance.\n\nAs of now, it doesn't seem likely that the Senate will take up a vote on this bill, or on either Landrieu's bill or a similar one introduced by Mark Udall (D-CO). Leadership, represented by Sen. Dick Durbin is saying a legislative fix isn't needed.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Daily Kos", "description": "Rep.
