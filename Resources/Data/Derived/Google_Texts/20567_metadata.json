Cerise\u2019s latest spending proposal predicts a $13 million deficit that still must be resolved. County taxpayers would kick in $496 million next year, or 36 percent of the total.\n\nThe proposed new hospital district tax rate of 28.6 cents per $100 assessed value would mean a $414 property tax bill for the owner of a $144,733 house, the county average. The owner of last year\u2019s average home paid $377 this year, or $37 less. Part of that increase is because property values in the county went up 6.6 percent this year.\n\nVoters approve in \u201908\n\nIn 2008, county voters overwhelmingly agreed to underwrite the new $1.3 billion hospital by adding 1 cent to the property tax rate in the future. That is the increase that would go into effect next year.\n\nCerise said his staff continues to search for outside revenue that would balance next year\u2019s budget, without cutting much-needed medical services.\n\nParkland\u2019s financial pinch is occurring even as there\u2019s more demand for its services. Emergency department visits are projected to increase next year by 4 percent, including a 29 percent increase in visits to the psychiatric ER.\n\nCommunity clinic visits could climb by 14 percent next year, while clinics on the hospital\u2019s main campus could see a 3 percent increase.\n\nAs Cerise warned of Parkland\u2019s grim financial prospects, he drew supportive comments from all five commissioners.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a sustainable model,\u201d said Mike Cantrell, the lone Republican commissioner. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to do something.\u201d\n\nCerise said he was informed recently by the state that Parkland would lose about $37 million in expected Medicaid funding this year. Large public hospitals, including Dallas County\u2019s, are required to share more of the program\u2019s supplemental funding each year with private hospitals that also provide indigent care.\n\n\u201cThis cannot continue,\u201d agreed Commissioner Elba Garcia. \u201cWe have to get some of this money back to Parkland.\u201d\n\nObamacare limits\n\nThe county hospital also is seeing only a modest financial benefit from the federal Affordable Care Act, which went into effect last January. As of mid-July, Parkland had received $5.4 million in payments for about 1,100 patients newly covered by the law. The funds reimbursed the cost of their care but did not address other hospital expenses.\n\nParkland\u2019s financial problems could be resolved if Texas leaders allowed the expansion of Medicaid, Cerise said. An expanded program could give coverage to more than 1 million poor adults of working age, many of them Parkland patients.\n\nGov. Rick Perry\u2019s administration estimated that the state would have to put up $15.6 billion during the first decade of the program, which the governor and others felt was too much. By not expanding coverage, however, the state leaves $101.1 billion in federal Medicaid matching money on the table for that 10-year period.\n\nCerise said he was not holding out hope that Medicaid would expand, even if the Texas Legislature takes up the issue next year.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t put the Medicaid funds in the budget for next year,\u201d he said.\n\nAT A GLANCE: New Parkland costs\n\nThe following are some additional costs to Parkland as the new hospital opens next year.\n\n$28 million for increased depreciation and interest expenses\n\n$10 million for added utility costs and building maintenance\n\n$4.3 million for software and hardware\n\n$1.7 million for educational marketing and community events\n\n$1.3 million for supplies related to a new surge of patients\n\n$1.1 million for medical-surgical supplies\n\nSOURCE: Parkland Health & Hospital System", "article_metadata": {"description": "An increase is needed, officials say, to cover the added costs of operating the new Parkland Memorial Hospital opening next year.", "og": {"description": "An increase is needed, officials say, to cover the added costs of operating the new Parkland Memorial Hospital opening next year.", "title": "Parkland seeks 10% property tax increase to cover new building", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/news/metro/20140812-parkland-seeks-10-property-tax-increase-to-cover-new-building.ece", "image": {"width": 2600, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/incoming/20140812-79_treeofmight080614gc_39159405.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/79_TREEOFMIGHT080614GC_39159405.JPG", "height": 1733}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2014-08-13T02:58:42Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2014-08-13T02:39:26Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Parkland seeks 10% property tax increase to cover new building\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/news/metro/20140812-parkland-seeks-10-property-tax-increase-to-cover-new-building.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/incoming/20140812-79_treeofmight080614gc_39159405.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/79_TREEOFMIGHT080614GC_39159405.JPG\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"1855206\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-08-13T02:39:26Z\", \"section\": \"Metro\", \"author\": \"SHERRY JACOBSON\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/incoming/20140812-79_treeofmight080614gc_39159405.jpg.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/79_TREEOFMIGHT080614GC_39159405.JPG", "publishtime": "2014-08-13T02:39:26Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc95fe\"", "article_summary": "Dallas County taxpayers can expect a nearly 10 percent hike in property taxes for Parkland Memorial Hospital next year to cover the cost of its new building.\nThe proposed new hospital district tax rate of 28.6 cents per $100 assessed value would mean a $414 property tax bill for the owner of a $144,733 house, the county average.\nAT A GLANCE: New Parkland costsThe following are some additional costs to Parkland as the new hospital opens next year.\nPart of that increase is because property values in the county went up 6.6 percent this year.\nVoters approve in \u201908In 2008, county voters overwhelmingly agreed to underwrite the new $1.3 billion hospital by adding 1 cent to the property tax rate in the future."}
