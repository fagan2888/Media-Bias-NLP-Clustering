Yet that is exactly what Marvel Studios has managed with the Iron Man series. In the character of Tony Stark we see the pinnacle of the capitalist fantasy: an ingenious businessman who values property rights and self-defense, and who does not compromise those fundamental rights in the face of government intimidation and force.\n\nIron Man is the ultimate superhero for the advocates of the free market.\n\nIntellectual Property\n\nIn the second film in the series, Tony Stark is forced to appear before a Senate committee seeking to confiscate the Iron Man suit for the sake of national security. Stark rejects the edicts of the government, walking out on the committee while claiming to have \u201cprivatized world peace\u201d (more on that later).\n\nThe character of Tony Stark is an intractable opponent of government overreach. He demands that he be left alone with his own invention, without the meddling of the state. The beauty of the film is that it creates a remarkably sympathetic portrayal of Stark\u2019s position, something very rarely done in films of this kind. It is a testament to Marvel\u2019s willingness to push boundaries that they would approve a storyline that tears down the government and the misguided notion that property rights are optional when the government is involved.\n\nThe power of the free market is further defended in the film by comparing Tony Stark\u2019s Iron Man technology to the government subsidized Hammer Industries. Hammer\u2019s armor is buggy, grotesque, and ineffective. The comparison between it and Stark\u2019s Iron Man armor offers a potent parable on the wastefulness and worthlessness of government intervention into business.\n\nArmed Society, Free Society\n\nIron Man does not blanch from the twin topics of the right to bear arms and the disparity of arms between citizens and government. On the issue of armament itself, the films are unequivocally in favor of people\u2019s right to defend themselves with weapons. The Iron Man suit represents the ultimate advancement of individual protective and defensive technology: virtually indestructible and capable of going toe-to-toe with most conventional military forces and equipment. It is that access to a new kind of \u201cgreat equalizer\u201d that will usher in the era of privatized world peace of which Stark speaks.\n\nImagine a world in which the government is unable to enact its will through force and physical coercion, a world in which all citizens have the capacity to defend themselves from any harm that might confront them. That would represent a fundamental shift in the relationship between citizen and state, one perhaps more akin to the power relationship that persisted in the early American republic when armaments between citizen and military were virtually at parity.\n\nThe future implied by Iron Man is a pleasantly optimistic one. It is one that respects property, individual freedom, and a more reasonable relationship between citizen and state.\n\nWaiting for Tomorrow\n\nUnfortunately, technology like the Iron Man suit appears to be a long way off yet. The federal government still wields a massively disparate military power relative to the citizenry. But it is valuable to imagine the future we want to see and to visualize ways we might get there.\n\nIt has become a matter of conventional wisdom that citizens, whether armed or not, are no match for the government (which, perversely, has been used from time to time as a justification for greater restrictions on owning weapons). Whether true or not, the status quo need not be static. The free market usually finds a way to meet demand. There is reason to be optimistic it will do so here, though the solution may not be as cool as Iron Man armor.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://blog.heartland.org/2014/08/iron-man-the-ultimate-capitalist-fantasy/", "type": "activity", "image": "http://blog.heartland.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/iron_man_2_tony_stark.jpg", "site_name": "Somewhat Reasonable", "title": "Iron Man: The Ultimate Capitalist Fantasy"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "There is reason to be optimistic it will do so here, though the solution may not be as cool as Iron Man armor.\nIron Man is the ultimate superhero for the advocates of the free market.\nYet that is exactly what Marvel Studios has managed with the Iron Man series.\nThe comparison between it and Stark\u2019s Iron Man armor offers a potent parable on the wastefulness and worthlessness of government intervention into business.\nWaiting for TomorrowUnfortunately, technology like the Iron Man suit appears to be a long way off yet."}
