He has convinced himself that he is disliked by many Americans because he is black.\n\nIn a lengthy interview with New Yorker magazine editor David Remnick the president tells him, \"There\u2019s no doubt that there\u2019s some folks who just really dislike me because they don\u2019t like the idea of a black president. Now, the flip side of it is there are some black folks and maybe some white folks who really like me and give me the benefit of the doubt precisely because I\u2019m a black president.\"\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s approval rating has fallen badly in the national polls. His ratings are historically low. The second lowest in modern history at this point of a presidency. Lower than Bush. Lower than everyone but Richard Nixon.\n\n[pullquote]\n\nHere come the excuses. Obama desperately wants to believe it\u2019s all because he\u2019s black. Because if he didn\u2019t have that excuse, it would have to be based on his performance.\n\nWhen Obama blames \"some folks\" for not liking him because he's black, he refers to conservatives and white Americans. I\u2019m an unapologetic member of both groups.\n\nIt\u2019s an interesting excuse.\n\nIf we disliked him for the color of his skin, that would excuse his failed performance as president. How convenient. That would excuse everything he\u2019s done to damage or destroy American exceptionalism, capitalism, and the U.S. economy.\n\nIf this was about race, it would excuse his dismantling of the economy. It would excuse the 92 million working-age Americans not in the workforce.\n\nIt would excuse all-time record lows for workforce participation. It would excuse tens of thousands, and in some cases, hundreds of thousands of Americans dropping out of the workforce every month.\n\nIt would excuse the fact that only crummy, crappy, low-wage part-time jobs are being created because of Obama\u2019s policies.\n\nIf this was about race, it would excuse Obama taking the formerly greatest health care system in the world and plunging it into crisis and confusion.\n\nIt would distract us from seeing his failed ObamaCare web site that cost hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nOr his blatant lies about keeping our health insurance if we like it. Or his lies about the middle class not being taxed to pay for 30 million new patients.\n\nOr his lies about the quality of care remaining the same, even though we\u2019ve added 30 million new patients, with no new doctors.\n\nOr his lies about prices going down, while our rates are going through the roof, and his own IRS predicts health insurance will cost the average family a staggering $20,000 per year by 2016.\n\nIf this was about race, it would excuse his lies about wanting to create jobs for middle class Americans while he\u2019s made conscious decisions to hire foreign companies (who rely on cheap foreign labor) to build and fix the defective ObamaCare website.\n\nIf this was about race, it would excuse his never ending spending and debt.\n\nOr the damage he\u2019s done to middle class Americans -- the doubling of gas prices, the all-time record highs for electricity, the jobs he\u2019s destroyed by not approving oil drilling, or fracking, or the Keystone Pipeline.\n\nOr using the EPA to try to put coal industry completely out of business.\n\nIt would excuse his using the power of the IRS to persecute Tea Party groups and conservative critics (like me), while allowing the IRS to hand out fraudulent tax refunds to illegal immigrants claiming fake dependents not even living in the United States.\n\nIt would excuse four dead American heroes in Benghazi, a refusal to send help while they were fighting for their lives, and a blatant cover-up before the election.\n\nBut putting all that aside, let me point out a few inconsistencies in Obama\u2019s allegation against conservatives:\n\nFirst, I don\u2019t dislike Obama. I dislike his beliefs and his policies.\n\nSecond, last I checked Obama is not just \u201cblack.\u201d He\u2019s half white, born by a white mother, raised by white grandparents.\n\nThird, I\u2019ve been consistent my entire life. I\u2019ve been a true blue conservative patriot since age 3, when I handed out campaign literature for Barry Goldwater, in my father\u2019s arms. I judge people by their political beliefs and policies, not the color of their skin.\n\nAt the age of 11, I despised the policies of ultra-leftist Presidential candidate George McGovern. His beliefs and policies were almost identical to Obama\u2019s today. Did I hate white Midwestern men?\n\nIn 1980, as a student at Columbia University, I despised the policies of President Jimmy Carter, whose policies were almost identical to Obama\u2019s today. Did I hate white Southern men?\n\nToday, I despise the policies of ultra-leftist politicians like Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. Do I therefore hate white Mormons and Italians?\n\nLastly, I can think of many Jewish Democrats whose policies I despise. The first one that comes to mind is Debbie Wasserman Schultz, whose statements often make me physically ill. Does that mean I hate Jews? That\u2019s pretty funny, because I\u2019m Jewish.\n\nIn each case a Republican conservative like me despises the political beliefs and policies of people I believe now, or believed back then, to be extreme, radical, socialist, economically ignorant, and damaging to America and capitalism.\n\nNo, Mr. Obama, we don\u2019t dislike you because you\u2019re black. But we do despise your policies, your lies, and your destruction of the greatest country, economy and middle class in world history.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.modified": "2015-01-30 02:30:55 EST", "dcterms.abstract": "President Obama has convinced himself that he is despised by many Americans because he is black.", "twitter": {"description": "President Obama has convinced himself that he is despised by many Americans because he is black.", "creator": "@foxnews", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2014/01/21/no-mr-obama-dont-dislike-because-youre-black.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/thumbnails/i/012114/0/0/012114_anhq_obama_640.jpg?ve=1", "title": "No, Mr. Obama, we don\u2019t dislike you because you\u2019re black", "site": "@foxnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "parsely-metadata": "{\"author\":\"\",\"subSection\":\"opinion\",\"title\":\"No, Mr. Obama, we don\\u2019t dislike you because you\\u2019re black\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/thumbnails/i/012114/0/0/012114_anhq_obama_640.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-01-21T18:44:11Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2014/01/21/no-mr-obama-dont-dislike-because-youre-black.html\",\"type\":\"article\",\"identifier\":\"6c18d6f5-80b6-4e8f-9af7-79dc8db7c0d4\",\"section\":\"opinion\"}", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "prism.channel": "fnc", "dc.description": "President Obama has convinced himself that he is despised by many Americans because he is black.", "dc.identifier": "6c18d6f5-80b6-4e8f-9af7-79dc8db7c0d4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "pagetype": "article", "description": "President Obama has convinced himself that he is despised by many Americans because he is black.", "prism.section": "opinion", "fb": {"app_id": 113186182048399}, "dc.source": "FoxNews.com", "dc.language": "en-US", "dc.title": "No, Mr. Obama, We Don\u2019t Dislike You Because You\u2019re Black", "dcterms.created": "2015-01-30 02:30:55 EST", "og": {"site_name": "Fox News", "description": "President Obama has convinced himself that he is despised by many Americans because he is black.", "title": "No, Mr. Obama, we don\u2019t dislike you because you\u2019re black | Fox News", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2014/01/21/no-mr-obama-dont-dislike-because-youre-black.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/thumbnails/i/012114/0/0/012114_anhq_obama_640.jpg?ve=1", "type": "article"}, "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.date": "2014-01-21", "parsely-page": "{\"author\":\"\",\"subSection\":\"opinion\",\"title\":\"No, Mr. Obama, we don\\u2019t dislike you because you\\u2019re black\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/thumbnails/i/012114/0/0/012114_anhq_obama_640.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-01-21T18:44:11Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2014/01/21/no-mr-obama-dont-dislike-because-youre-black.html\",\"post_id\":\"6c18d6f5-80b6-4e8f-9af7-79dc8db7c0d4\",\"type\":\"article\",\"section\":\"opinion\"}"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0ca9\"", "article_summary": "No, Mr. Obama, we don\u2019t dislike you because you\u2019re black.\nWhen Obama blames \"some folks\" for not liking him because he's black, he refers to conservatives and white Americans.\nSecond, last I checked Obama is not just \u201cblack.\u201d He\u2019s half white, born by a white mother, raised by white grandparents.\nObama desperately wants to believe it\u2019s all because he\u2019s black.\nIn a lengthy interview with New Yorker magazine editor David Remnick the president tells him, \"There\u2019s no doubt that there\u2019s some folks who just really dislike me because they don\u2019t like the idea of a black president."}
