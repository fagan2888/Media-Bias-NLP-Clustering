A project he initiated in 2013, with a student chapter, is bringing clean drinking water to a village in Peru...Hawk was halfway through his senior year studying mechanical engineering when he got involved with Engineers Without Borders at the University of New Hampshire. While that sounds like he was late getting started, what he really was doing was looking for someone to help his new friends in Peru...Hawk and his girlfriend had spent a couple of months one summer teaching English in San Pedro de Casta, and the connections they made with a local family inspired him to reach out to the nonprofit. Hawk had heard great things about the UNH student chapter and that they had been doing similar work in Africa...With the group's help, Hawk organized a trip to Peru in the summer of 2013 to begin work on a water sanitation project. He and his girlfriend (now his fiancee) lived there for a month, working with two teams of UNH students that each stayed for two weeks...\"I had a pretty limited time with them, but it was four or five months of pretty intense planning, delving right into writing some of our plans for the safety and emergencies, looking at all the flights, all the stuff that was needed to get our group of people down there,\" said Hawk, 24...UNH student teams continue to travel to Peru to work on the project, and Hawk, who now lives in Dover and works for the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, is considering a return trip. So the timing was right when fellow engineer Heidi Lemieux told him about plans to establish a professional chapter of Engineers Without Borders in New Hampshire...Lemieux and Jon Ordway, both engineers at Sanborn Head, have organized a meeting at 6 p.m Wednesday at the company's office at 20 Foundry St. in Concord. The session will focus on the group's mission, what the role of a professional chapter in New Hampshire might be and the steps required to submit an application to create one...\"I've always been interested in Engineers Without Borders,\" said Lemieux, an environmental engineer who focuses on remediation work. \"I wanted to get involved with it when I was in college, and I never had the chance to.\"..Engineers Without Borders USA was founded in 2002 by Bernard Amadei, a civil engineering professor at the University of Colorado who had recruited his students a couple of years before to work on a water and sanitation project in Belize. The group now has more than 14,700 members and has worked on 684 projects in 39 countries, according to its website...Like Hawk, whom she met through the UNH chapter, Lemieux's interest was sparked by visiting a developing country. While she was in high school, she traveled to Nicaragua with a group of students to teach basic education and hygiene...\"It was really an eye-opening experience to be down there and help them out,\" said Lemieux, who taught locals about the importance of washing hands and brushing teeth. \"When I went into the field of environmental engineering, I wanted to use that and help people.\"..In addition to Peru, the UNH student chapter is currently working on a project in Uganda. Lemieux and her colleagues figure they could use professional mentoring. She said about a dozen engineers have committed to joining the group so far...\"A lot of student chapters in other states would have a professional chapter that works directly with them,\" said Lemieux, 23. \"The state of New Hampshire is one of the few that doesn't, so that would be a role we could take on.\"..Engineers Without Borders chapters must make a five-year commitment for their international projects, traveling once or twice a year to work on them and check on progress. Despite the group's name, professionals from disciplines other than engineering are encouraged to participate...\"It would be super helpful to have more than just engineers,\" Lemieux said. \"Even if you're an engineer, there's a wide variety of engineers, whether its structural, environmental, civil - it takes all kinds of brain work and power to put something like this together.\"..Some of the work must come from the people Engineers Without Borders seeks to help. Before starting a project, a chapter must secure agreements from a community that its members will participate.\"We're not just giving them some charity, just throwing money at them and hoping that it sticks,\" Hawk said. \"We're involving them in the entire process, making sure that they are invested it, and they agree with all the things that we're doing.\"..The project in San Pedro de Casta involves creating a filtration system to remove contaminants from drinking water, a common problem in rural areas where livestock are raised closed to water sources. Just as important is \"educating the town so they know the difference between the clean water that is going through the filtration system and the irrigation water that they are using for their crops,\" Hawk said.....Mike Cote is business editor.
