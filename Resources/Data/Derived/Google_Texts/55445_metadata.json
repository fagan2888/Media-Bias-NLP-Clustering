It was also a way to ensure that both hospitals and pharmaceutical manufacturers share in the cost of providing treatment and medication to the uninsured.\n\nUnder 340B, pharmaceutical companies are required to offer prescription medications to certain hospital systems and health clinics at deeply discounted rates. The savings can then be used to provide care for uninsured or underinsured patients.\n\n340B has been in place for more than 20 years, helping millions of uninsured and financially vulnerable patients across the country. But during this time, few changes have been made to the program \u2013 even in the wake of significant, nationwide health care reform. I doubt many 20-year-old programs are still perfectly aligned to the modern times.\n\nSince the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, the number of Americans without medical coverage has fallen dramatically. In fact, Kentucky experienced one of the nation\u2019s sharpest declines in uninsured adult residents.\n\nTheoretically, we would expect to see this rise in coverage slow the growth of 340B. After all, the program is meant to serve the uninsured \u2013 and as more Americans obtain coverage, fewer will need to rely on the program to access affordable medications.\n\nExperts, however, are predicting just the opposite \u2013 but why?\n\nWhile this seems counterintuitive at first glance, the issue lies in 340B\u2019s guidelines for determining which providers can receive the drug manufacturer discounts. Currently, one key factor in hospital eligibility is the number of Medicaid patients treated at the facility on an inpatient basis.\n\nThis means, paradoxically, as more individuals gain access to Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, more hospitals will become eligible to receive 340B. Fewer patients will need 340B assistance, yet the program will continue to expand.\n\nHospitals have been vital in caring for the uninsured \u2013 and 340B has given them the resources to provide additional care among those who need it most. But health care in America is changing, and our existing efforts to improve access to care must change with it.\n\n340B was created before the implementation of the Affordable Care Act and the resulting increase in access to health insurance. Coverage is considerably more available to patients today than in the 1990s.\n\nAlthough the number of insured Americans has risen significantly in recent years, work remains to be done. Many individuals continue to live without insurance and struggle to access the treatments prescribed to them by their physicians.\n\nThe 340B program still plays an important role in keeping these patients healthy, and should stay in place to help those who need it most.\n\nBut when examined in the context of our current health care landscape, certain parts of 340B \u2013 the criteria for determining hospital eligibility \u2013 have become outdated and even contradict the original intent of the program.\n\nSimply put, the program needs a refresh.\n\nAs is the case with all government programs, there is only so much money allocated to 340B. Each dollar that\u2019s dispersed unnecessarily is a dollar that cannot be spent helping a patient without coverage obtain the medication she needs.\n\nIf the health care industry truly wants to achieve its goal of ensuring access to care, the 340B program must be reevaluated to align more closely with the state of health care today.\n\nDr. Kyle Keeney is the Executive Director of the Kentucky Life Sciences Council (KLSC).
