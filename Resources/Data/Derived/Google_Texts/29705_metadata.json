Mary Pilcher-Cook, a Republican from Shawnee, said the fee would generate between $18 million and $24 million annually.\n\nThe money, she said, would be deposited in a fund that would be used to offset costs associated with the state\u2019s Medicaid program and its implementation of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.\n\n\u201cWe are doing this not because of the budget hole,\u201d Pilcher-Cook said Wednesday, referring to the Legislature\u2019s ongoing debate over how to fill a more than $400 million gap in the state\u2019s budget for next fiscal year, which begins July 1.\n\n\u201cWe are doing this because of the increased costs that Obamacare has put on the state, and because of the costs of our managing Medicaid,\u201d she said.\n\nThe fee, Pilcher-Cook said, would be retroactive, dating back to Jan. 1, 2015, and would be paid by the insurance companies currently selling plans on the marketplace.\n\n\u201cWhether that (fee) is passed on to the customer would be up to the insurance companies,\u201d she said.\n\nThe fee, Pilcher-Cook said, would be collected by the Kansas Insurance Department.\n\nThe marketplace was established as part of the Affordable Care Act to provide access to health insurance plans for individuals and businesses. Nearly 100,000 Kansans purchased insurance through the marketplace for 2015.\n\nSenate Bill 309, introduced Tuesday, will be the subject of a hearing tentatively scheduled for 1 p.m. Thursday at the Statehouse.\n\nIn Kansas, three companies sell plans on the state\u2019s federally administered online marketplace: Coventry Health Care of Kansas, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas City and Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas.\n\nFederal law allows states to assess fees on plans sold through state-administered marketplaces. Whether states would be allowed to do the same with plans sold on federally administered sites \u2014 like the one in Kansas \u2014 is an open question.\n\nPilcher-Cook she was unaware of any other state having done what she\u2019s proposed.\n\nAlso unclear is whether the federal government will allow the state to collect a fee on marketplace plans that it wouldn\u2019t collect on those sold outside the marketplace or offered by employers.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if we can charge a fee on one and not the other,\u201d said Sen. Jim Denning, an Overland Park Republican and chair of the Senate Ways and Means Committee\u2019s subcommittee on social services. \u201cI don\u2019t think we can, but we\u2019ll see. I suspect that\u2019ll be addressed in the hearing.\u201d\n\nMary Beth Chambers, a spokesperson for Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas, said the company will oppose Pilcher-Cook\u2019s initiative.\n\n\u201cWhile new taxes that result in higher premiums for Kansas are never ideal for Kansans, we are specifically concerned about this approach because it is, ultimately, double taxation,\u201d Chambers said. \u201cWe pay a 3.5 percent tax on our ACA-compliant plan premiums to the federal government now, so this would double that. We would be paying 3.5 percent to the feds and 3.5 to the state.\u201d\n\nThe increase, she said, likely would be passed on to consumers.\n\nAlso, Chambers said, marketplace insurers are required to offer identical plans \u2014 both in coverage and cost \u2014 to their individual and small-group customers. Adding 3.5 percent to the marketplace plans, she said, would force a corresponding increase on premiums sold outside the marketplace.\n\nSen. Laura Kelly, a Topeka Democrat and the Senate health committee\u2019s ranking minority member, panned the proposal.\n\n\u201cThis would be just one more tax on the poor, because we all know the insurance companies are going to turn around and build this into the premium,\u201d Kelly said.\n\nConsumers who buy insurance through the marketplace are eligible for tax credits or subsidies, based on their income, that help cover the cost of insurance. Eighty percent of enrollees in Kansas received federal subsidies in the form of tax credits.\n\nLawmakers and other state leaders including Gov. Sam Brownback have resisted expanding the state\u2019s Medicaid program http://www.khi.org/news/article/medicaid-expansion-discussion-in-kansas-has-a-new-twist to include all Kansans with annual incomes up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level: $16,105 for an individual and $32,913 for a family of four.\n\nRep. Barbara Bollier, a moderate Republican from Mission Hills and a member of the House Health and Human Services Committee, said Pilcher-Cook\u2019s plan for offsetting some of the state\u2019s Medicaid costs was ill-conceived.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s wanting to rob Peter to pay Paul,\u201d said Bollier, a retired anesthesiologist. \u201cThese are people who, for the most part, are getting a discount from the federal government on their health insurance \u2014 and now we\u2019re going to charge them because they\u2019re getting a discount? Because they\u2019re getting insurance?\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re really concerned about the money, then let\u2019s bring in some real money,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s expand Medicaid.\u201d\n\nDave Ranney is a reporter for KHI News Service in Topeka, a partner in the Heartland Health Monitor team.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health", "description": "Sen.
