The New Jersey governor, himself a GOP White House aspirant, invoked the line used by Trump on the show \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d when speaking to a town hall in New Hampshire on Thursday. \u201cI know he says he tells it like it is, too. I tell it like it is from the standpoint of having actually done these jobs,\u201d Christie said. \u201cI think quite frankly Donald would be a little frustrated if he became president of the United States.\u201d\n\nTrump leads another poll: There\u2019s a reason Christie and other Republican hopefuls are talking about Trump. Another poll, released Thursday night, showed him leading the Republican field. This time, it was a Fox News survey showing the billionaire with 18% support from GOP primary voters. Earlier this week, a USA Today/Suffolk poll had Trump in the lead \u2014 though he was the weakest against Democrat Hillary Clinton among the top seven GOP candidates.\n\nBush on equal pay: Jeb Bush indicated Thursday he thinks existing laws are sufficient to ensure men and women are paid equally for the same work, writes Time magazine. The former Florida governor, also a Republican White House hopeful, said in response to a question: \u201cWages should be equal, and there are laws to make it so, and they should be enforced.\u201d Bush was also asked about his position on legislation to ban discrimination against LGBT Americans. He replied: \u201cI don\u2019t think you should be discriminated because of your sexual orientation. Period. Over and out.\u201d\n\nCoal country: There\u2019s a new chapter in what Republicans call the Obama administration\u2019s \u201cwar on coal\u201d and the White House calls protection for Americans\u2019 health. The administration unveiled guidelines Thursday designed to protect streams from pollution caused by coal mining. The proposed rule, writes National Journal, strengthens a decades-old regulation requiring mining activity to take place at least 100 feet away from streams. One GOP critic, Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming, said the rule was \u201cdesigned to help put coal country out of business.\u201d\n\nThe life Obama could have had: President Obama said Thursday his life could have been very different had it not been for the family and community support that many young men of color lack. Obama, writes the Washington Post, suggested inside the walls of a federal prison in Oklahoma that under different circumstances he could have been there as an inmate rather than as president. \u201cThat\u2019s what strikes me \u2014 there but for the grace of God,\u201d Obama said, standing in an empty cell block. Obama, who has acknowledged using marijuana and trying cocaine in his youth, became the first sitting president to visit a federal prison Thursday.\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "description": "Chris Christie on why Donald Trump would be \u2018frustrated\u2019 as president; Jeb Bush on equal pay; a new fight over coal between the Obama administration and Republicans; and more.", "creator": "@mktwrobs", "image": {"width": 1320, "identifier": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DK651_Christ_ZG_20150428152347.jpg", "height": 742}, "site": {"id": 624413}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "parsely-author": "Robert Schroeder", "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "article.section": "Economy & Politics", "parsely-type": "post", "description": "Chris Christie on why Donald Trump would be \u2018frustrated\u2019 as president; Jeb Bush on equal pay; a new fight over coal between the Obama administration and Republicans; and more.", "parsely-link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/chris-christie-donald-trump-would-be-frustrated-as-president-2015-07-17", "author": "Robert Schroeder", "parsely-title": "Chris Christie: Donald Trump would be \u2018frustrated\u2019 as president", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=336693422", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-07-17T08:26:00-04:00", "page.site": "marketwatch", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 283204329838}, "parsely-section": "MW_Economy & Politics", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "MarketWatch", "description": "Chris Christie on why Donald Trump would be \u2018frustrated\u2019 as president; Jeb Bush on equal pay; a new fight over coal between the Obama administration and Republicans; and more.", "title": "Chris Christie: Donald Trump would be \u2018frustrated\u2019 as president", "url": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/chris-christie-donald-trump-would-be-frustrated-as-president-2015-07-17", "image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DK651_Christ_ZG_20150428152347.jpg", "type": "article"}, "ob": {"image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DK651_Christ_ZG_20150428152347.jpg"}, "article.id": "062765B2-2C75-11E5-90A1-4AE15AC6FD58", "position": 1}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd327c\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI think quite frankly Donald would be a little frustrated if he became president of the United States.\u201dTrump leads another poll: There\u2019s a reason Christie and other Republican hopefuls are talking about Trump.\nThe president doesn\u2019t get to say \u201cYou\u2019re fired!\u201dThat, writes Bloomberg, is Chris Christie\u2019s message for Donald Trump as the billionaire sees his standing grow in the 2016 Republican presidential field.\nThe New Jersey governor, himself a GOP White House aspirant, invoked the line used by Trump on the show \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d when speaking to a town hall in New Hampshire on Thursday.\nObama, writes the Washington Post, suggested inside the walls of a federal prison in Oklahoma that under different circumstances he could have been there as an inmate rather than as president.\nObama, who has acknowledged using marijuana and trying cocaine in his youth, became the first sitting president to visit a federal prison Thursday."}
