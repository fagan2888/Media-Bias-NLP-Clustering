Urias said many of the Arizonans who come to Enroll America for information are surprised to learn they are eligible for health coverage.\n\n\u201cA lot of Arizonans want coverage but don\u2019t realize they qualify,\u201d she said.\n\nEnroll America started its \u201cGet Covered America\u201d campaign in Arizona and 10 other states last October for the open enrollment period under the Affordable Care Act \u2013 better known as \u201cObamacare\u201d \u2013 that ran through March.\n\nNot only are they suprised they qualify, but Urias said that by speaking with people around the state she has learned that they are surprised they can afford coverage.\n\n\u201cA lot of people want to know how much it is going to cost them,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat they don\u2019t realize is that the majority of them are very likely to qualify for some type of financial assistance.\u201d\n\nAdvocates said at least one factor that could lead to a significant improvement in Arizona\u2019s coverage rate does not show up in the Census numbers \u2013 the state\u2019s decision to expand Medicaid.\n\nArizona was one of 27 states and the District of Columbia that chose to expand their Medicaid programs as part of Obamacare. The state\u2019s decision last year to expand Medicaid was expected to provide coverage to an additional 300,000 low-income residents that year.\n\nMatt Broaddus, research analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said those numbers are not reflected in the 2013 Census data. But he said more recent surveys from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Urban Institute show the expansion is having an effect.\n\nMore than 1.6 million Arizonans are enrolled in the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System, the state\u2019s Medicaid program.\n\nBroaddus said the number of uninsured is likely to continue to drop due to a \u201cwidening gap\u201d between states that have chosen to expand Medicaid and those that haven\u2019t.\n\n\u201cThat gap that already existed in 2013 is growing larger in 2014,\u201d he said. \u201cThe potential is that it will drop, and it may drop even faster than a comparable state that hasn\u2019t expanded Medicaid.\u201d\n\n^__=\n\n- 30 -", "article_metadata": {"DC.identifier": "http://www.tucsonsentinel.com/local/report/091714_uninsured_az/number-az-uninsured-dropping-still-higher-than-natl-average/", "author": "Miranda Rivers", "twitter": {"description": "While it fell, Arizona's uninsured rate, at 17.1 percent, was higher than the nation's 14.5 percent.
