Specifically, that the Cougars weren\u2019t in it.\n\nTrue, the Cougars, who began the season ranked No. 2, dropped their season opener, a close one to Chatfield while having more than a half-dozen suspensions. But they followed with a 42-0 blasting of Fort Collins before crushing Gateway 48-0 (the 40-point mercy rule was employed before halftime) Saturday afternoon in nonleague action at Aurora Public Schools Stadium.\n\nNo matter. The Cougars are resigned to the fact that it\u2019s simply one of those things they\u2019ll have to deal with while attempting to challenge again in 5A. Plus, more important matters are on the immediate horizon \u2014 Cherokee Trail will host undefeated Regis Jesuit next weekend before heading into the always-demanding Centennial League schedule.\n\nQuarterback Aric Johnson, who threw for three touchdowns and ran for one, said the Cougars don\u2019t care where they\u2019re ranked.\n\n\u201cWe just want to play fast and play CT football,\u201d he said.\n\nCougars coach Monte Thelen fretted more about his team\u2019s lack of practice time last week. With only two days outside, the Cougars started slowly Saturday before kicking it in.\n\n\u201cWe played well, but got off a little slow,\u201d Thelen said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got most of our guys here now, so it gives us a little more continuity. The weather\u2019s really playing havoc with us.\u201d\n\nAs for being unranked, Thelen said, \u201cI think most people know \u2026 but, first of all, tons of credit to Chatfield. (The Chargers) played great. They won on the last play of the game. But I think a lot of people know that the team that played the last two weeks and the team that played against Chatfield (has) a lot more guys playing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt happens,\u201d he said of players violating team rules. \u201cWe love our guys, but sometimes our guys, just like our own children, make choices that they probably regret and you\u2019ve got to discipline them.\u201d\n\nAll told, Cherokee Trail rolled to a modest 369 yards of offense. Izaiah Lottie caught two scoring passes and Cameron Currington rushed for one and had a reception for another.\n\nGateway (2-1), managed to gain only 166 total yards against a Cougars defense has put up eight consecutive scoreless quarters.\n\n\u201cWe came out flat,\u201d Olys coach Ashour Peera said. \u201cThe whole first half was the difference. For our guys who go both ways, we should have performed better \u2026 just (the Cougars\u2019) personnel gave us problems.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Cherokee Trail routs Gateway 48-0 for second straight shutout", "title": "Cherokee Trail routs Gateway 48-0 for second straight shutout", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/09/14/cherokee-trail-routs-gateway-48-0-for-second-straight-shutout/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130915__monte-thelenp1.jpg", "height": 400}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130915__monte-thelenp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-14T19:29:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-29T06:21:14+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0634\"", "article_summary": "AURORA \u2014 Of course Cherokee Trail, the 2012 Class 5A state runner-up, noticed last week\u2019s CHSAANow.com media and coaches poll.\nPlus, more important matters are on the immediate horizon \u2014 Cherokee Trail will host undefeated Regis Jesuit next weekend before heading into the always-demanding Centennial League schedule.\nGateway (2-1), managed to gain only 166 total yards against a Cougars defense has put up eight consecutive scoreless quarters.\nFor our guys who go both ways, we should have performed better \u2026 just (the Cougars\u2019) personnel gave us problems.\u201d\n2, dropped their season opener, a close one to Chatfield while having more than a half-dozen suspensions."}
