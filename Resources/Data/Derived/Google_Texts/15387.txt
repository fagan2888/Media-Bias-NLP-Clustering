As the cyclists of Ride The Rockies — 2,000 in all — crossed the finish line Friday under the iconic arch in downtown Golden on the sixth and final day of the tour of 450-plus miles, some raised their hands. Others raised their bicycles. Some looked for the nearest hug.

Merely training for the annual tour through Colorado’s Rocky Mountains is alone an achievement. Overcoming the physical, mental and emotional challenges to finish the event can be a life-changer, according to RTR tour director Chandler Smith.

But no cyclist can do it alone. And nowhere is that more evident than at the RTR aid stations, where a cadre of volunteers, vendors and technicians combine to provide oases every 15 or so miles along the course.

Included in the $500 registration fee are aid-station staples: portable toilets, fruit (oranges, grapes, bananas), snacks (pretzels, animal crackers), water, various flavors of Gatorade.

Also, at each aid station is a bike-tech tent, where cyclists can find free service as well as purchase parts. For instance, first-time RTR cyclist Meredith Martin of Brooklyn, N.Y., had two tires replaced (not tubes, tires) free of labor charges between the start Tuesday in Steamboat Springs and Aid 2 that same day.

Then there are the food vendors — mainstays, first-timers and one-timers — who sell everything from pancakes to tacos to veggie wraps to slices of walnut pie.
