The quilt even survived family members\u2019 attempts to divvy it up into four equal squares so everyone could own a piece, as well as thwarting its theft for a buyer promising $5,000.\n\nThe cherry quilt recently came to its new permanent home - the International Quilt Study Center and Museum at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.\n\nRotter, Stevens and fellow cousins Gene, Donn, Robert, Lee and Jay Knepper, unanimously agreeing on the final destination - something generations of cousins, aunts and uncles before them could not.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lovely, lovely piece,\u201d cooed Carolyn Ducey, the Quilt Center\u2019s curator of collections, as she set eyes on the quilt for the very first time July 10.\n\nFollowing a mandatory two week isolation to ensure the quilt is not hiding \u201cany unwelcome pests,\u201d the quilt will hang in the newly completed expansion of the museum, Ducey said. It will become part of the museum\u2019s permanent collection.\n\n\u201cQuilts like this are very, very valuable and very, very treasured,\u201d Ducey said.\n\nFor the Quilt Center, it is a special acquisition.\n\n\u201cVery few quilts in this style have been documented. This creates a benchmark in our collection, and it gives us information we don\u2019t have for other quilts,\u201d she said.\n\nWhat makes Myers\u2018 cherry quilt unique, besides its design and preservation, is that the quilt is dated and its creator and its story are known, Ducey said.\n\nAnd the story is one for the ages.\n\nCherry quilts, given then name because of the stemmed cherries appliqued in the design, became popular in the mid-1800s, when the newest fabric color - \u201cturkey red\u201d - first hit the market. Quilters squirreled away money in order to buy the red and green fabrics - considered a huge investment at the time, in part because of the Civil War and a shortage of available cotton.\n\n\u201cThese were really important things to these makers and their families,\u201d Ducey said.\n\nIn 1973, Agnes Close made that importance very clear in a letter to her cousin Robert Knepper and his wife, Maxine, (parents of Norma Jean).\n\nIn the letter, Agnes announces she is \u201clooking for a home for the quilt.\u201d She further documents why certain family members should not be allowed possession.\n\nShe writes of how Christina Myers gave the quilt to her son William Myers. But William failed to designate a beneficiary upon his death, which started a quarrel lasting three generations.\n\nAll four of William\u2019s children wanted the quilt. One sister suggested divvying it up into four equal pieces, but Walter, the only boy in the family, announced the quilt must stay with someone who had the Myers name (him).\n\n\u201cThe quilt was never given to Uncle Walt - he just took it,\u201d Agnes wrote in her letter.\n\nBefore he died, Walter gave the quilt to his son Dean, much to the dismay of daughter Bessie.\n\nAccording to family lore, Bessie simply decided that she would wait until her brother was out of the house and then steal the quilt.\n\nBut Dean was one step ahead of her.\n\n\u201cDean hid the quilt in a toolbox on top of the barn so Bessie couldn\u2019t find it,\u201d Agnes wrote. \u201cDean says Bessie knows someone in Lincoln who will give her $5,000 for the quilt, and she wants to sell it.\u201d\n\nTo keep the quilt from Bessie, Dean gave it to a cousin, who in turn gave it to her sister - Agnes Close.\n\n\u201c. Bessie is in a hurry for me to die so she can get it,\u201d Agnes wrote in her letter to the Kneppers. \u201cI\u2019m sure if anything happens to me the quilt is doomed for the auction block if it is here.\u201d\n\nWanting to thwart Bessie, she secretly sent the quilt to the Kneppers - promising not to tell anyone.\n\nFor many years no one knew about the quilt, said Norma Jean Stevens. After her mother\u2019s death, Norma Jean took the quilt to a family reunion. The cousins talked about what to do with such a fragile piece of family history.\n\nAunt Mary Ann Leefer suggested they donate it to the Quilt Center, where she was a volunteer.\n\nIt was an idea everyone could agree upon.\n\n\u201cThe museum is the best place for it,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cThis way it will be taken care of and the family will know where it is.\u201d\n\nAnd despite its physical location, the quilt will always belong to the family, Ducey said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "With the Civil War growing closer to home and rumors of soldiers burning homesteads, Thornton and Christina Myers took the family's most prized possessions - silverware and Christina's recently finished cherry quilt - and buried them 6 feet under.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "With the Civil War growing closer to home and rumors of soldiers burning homesteads, Thornton and Christina Myers took the family\u2019s most prized possessions - silverware and Christina\u2019s recently finished cherry quilt - and buried them 6 feet under.", "title": "TRAVEL: Civil War-era quilt finds permanent home at Nebraska museum", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jul/23/civil-war-era-quilt-stored-at-nebraska-museum/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/07/18/a2c0cdcdb79e601f7c0f6a7067004d00.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/07/18/a2c0cdcdb79e601f7c0f6a7067004d00.jpg", "description": "With the Civil War growing closer to home and rumors of soldiers burning homesteads, Thornton and Christina Myers took the family's most prized possessions - silverware and Christina's recently finish", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "TRAVEL: Civil War-era quilt finds permanent home at Nebraska museum"}, "Author": "ERIN ANDERSEN", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Norma Jean Stevens, Carolyn Ducey, Christina Myers, Lincoln, Quilt Center"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd5f67\"", "article_summary": "The cherry quilt recently came to its new permanent home - the International Quilt Study Center and Museum at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.\n\u201cThis way it will be taken care of and the family will know where it is.\u201dAnd despite its physical location, the quilt will always belong to the family, Ducey said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lovely, lovely piece,\u201d cooed Carolyn Ducey, the Quilt Center\u2019s curator of collections, as she set eyes on the quilt for the very first time July 10.\n\u201cDean hid the quilt in a toolbox on top of the barn so Bessie couldn\u2019t find it,\u201d Agnes wrote.\nFor many years no one knew about the quilt, said Norma Jean Stevens."}
