On the June 22nd edition of Your Call, we'll have a conversation with D.W. Gibson, journalist and author of The Edge Becomes the Center: An Oral History of Gentrification in the 21st Century. By interviewing a wide cross section of New Yorkers, from a drug dealer to a banking executive, Gibson gets inside the varied ways people experience and perceive the transformation of neighborhoods by the influx of new wealth and new residents. What does gentrification look like where you live?
