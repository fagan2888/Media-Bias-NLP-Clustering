The campus of the University of Northern Colorado in Greeley is closed Monday “due to widespread flooding in the region,” the school reported via twitter and on its website.

The UNC centers at Loveland and Colorado Springs have no classes, although the Lowry campus in Denver is open.

“The decision to close Monday was made in consideration of the issues facing communities and residents throughout the region, recognizing that members of the university community may have difficulty traveling to campus because of road closures or may be directly impacted by flooding in the communities where they reside,” the university statement read.

The Weld County Sheriff, meanwhile, has opened up its Work Release facility for Greeley and Evans residents in need of a hot shower but who don’t have access to their own facilities because of the flooding.

The Work Release building has four male and four female showers available each day from 2 p.m. to 8 p.m. “and limited hygiene supplies” are available, said the news release.

Residents are encouraged to bring their own towels and hygiene products. The work release facility, located at 1390 North 17th Ave. in Greeley, will be available on a first-come, first-serve basis, the sheriff said.

The city reported midmorning Monday that levels on the South Platte River dropped significantly overnight. A Red Cross shelter is still in operation at the Greeley Recreation Center, 651 10th Ave.
