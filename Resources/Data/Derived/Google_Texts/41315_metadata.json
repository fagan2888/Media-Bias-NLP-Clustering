Mike Lee (R-UT) used to pal around a lot with Josh Reid, the son of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV). Reid was a member of the House of Representatives back then and lived in the Virginia suburbs of Washington, DC. Lee\u2019s Dad, Rex Lee, worked at the Justice Department and later served as U.S. Solicitor General under President Reagan.\n\nBoth Mormon families, the Reids and Lees sometimes spent time together. And one day, as a practical joke, Reid locked the younger Lee in the garage for a few minutes.\n\nOne wonders if Reid didn't wish he still had that option today.\n\nLate Friday night, the Senate appeared poised to be out of session this weekend. Senators would pass a new interim spending bill so the government wouldn't shutter tonight and move to finish the broader funding bill - the so-called CRomnibus - Monday or Tuesday. In fact Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) had left for the night.\n\nBut Senate rules are crafted in such a way to respect the rights of the minority party. That means it sometimes just takes one senator or a handful of senators to upset the entire apple cart - even if most other senators disagree.\n\nMore On This... Senate approves temporary spending bill\n\nSo shortly before 11 pm Friday, Reid came down to the floor to obtain what\u2019s called \u201cunanimous consent\u201d (\u201cUC,\u201d in Senate terms) to send senators home for the weekend, conduct a procedural vote on the CRomnibus late Monday afternoon and take a final vote early next week.\n\nIt is said that paybacks are hell.\n\nLee immediately began to protest President Obama\u2019s executive order over immigration. And Reid had an understanding with McConnell they\u2019d pack up for the weekend and return Monday. Keep in mind that in the Senate, agreements between the Majority and Minority Leaders are practically hallowed accords.\n\n\u201cRight now we\u2019re being asked to punt all of our activity until Monday at 5 pm. I don\u2019t see any reason to do this,\u201d Lee protested.\n\nRemember, a sole objection can blow up any unanimous consent request in the Senate, despite what many others want to do.\n\nWhen the Senate finally turned to the CRomnibus spending bill Friday, Reid did two things. First, he filled what\u2019s called the \u201camendment tree\u201d with his own, technical provisions to the CRomnibus. It\u2019s the right of the Majority Leader to get first dibs at amending and filling that \u201ctree\u201d with his own provisions. That action effectively blocks other senators from trying to amend the bill. Certainly Lee and other conservative senators wanted to latch onto to the CRomnibus an amendment to block Mr. Obama\u2019s immigration executive orders. By the same token, Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and David Vitter (R-LA) crafted an amendment to yank out the controversial Wall Street \u201cbailout\u201d provision from the legislation. Reid also filed what\u2019s called a \u201ccloture petition.\u201d Senate rules permit unlimited debate and filibusters. But the way around delays is by rounding up 60 senators to \u201cinvoke cloture\u201d and cut off those debates and filibusters. Once cloture is invoked, a bill is on a glide path to a final vote.\n\nBy rule, one day must elapse between filing the cloture petition and when it \u201cripens\u201d for a vote. So that means the Senate couldn\u2019t vote to halt debate until Sunday. And even after cloture is achieved, senators have the right to burn off another 30 hours before final passage. That would mean the CRomnibus itself might not be eligible for an up or down vote until late in the day Monday.\n\nWith Reid filling up the amendment tree, Lee knew his childhood prankster nemesis had effectively locked him, this time, in the parliamentary garage.\n\n\u201cI would respectfully request for the Majority Leader to modify his request. And if he would modify his request to assure us that we would receive a vote on a spending limitation amendment that we could have in connection with a CRomnibus when we convene,\u201d Lee asked.\n\nReid slammed the door and turned the key.\n\n\u201cI am unable to do that,\u201d Reid replied.\n\n\u201cI object,\u201d Lee said in turn, essentially locking all 100 senators in the Senate chamber throughout weekend.\n\nAnd with that, Reid immediately ordered up a rare Saturday session of the Senate, hurtling toward a 1 am et Sunday vote to cut off the filibuster and the possibility of a 7 am Monday vote to pass the CRomnibus.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s inconvenient for a lot of people but I\u2019m sorry. We\u2019re the Senate. We\u2019ll have to rearrange our schedules for the weekend,\u201d Reid said.\n\nLee may have been the one on the floor torching the understanding between Reid and McConnell. But he was just one member of a cadre which disintegrated the deal. Alongside Lee were Sens. Ted Cruz (R-TX), Jeff Sessions (R-AL) and Vitter. The move outraged members and staff from both sides of the aisle.\n\nSeveral senior GOP sources described the maneuver as \u201cham-fisted\u201d and \u201camateurish,\u201d wondering openly what the insurrection meant for McConnell as Majority Leader next year. Would conservative members undercut McConnell in 2015?\n\nThe foursome wanted a vote on the CRomnibus to harness Department of Homeland Security funding for the immigration executive orders. Cruz said McConnell shouldn\u2019t have signed onto the agreement with Reid.\n\n\u201cWe made leadership fully aware for two days we were happy to consent and vote immediately on the CRomnibus if we got a vote on President Obama\u2019s illegal amnesty,\u201d said Cruz. \u201cWe accordingly exercised the leverage an individual senator has to secure a vote.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, since Reid filled the amendment tree, there will be no vote on an immigration-related amendment at this point. But Cruz and others could make a point of order at the end of the process, potentially sufficing as the vote they seek.\n\nI asked McConnell when he arrived at the Capitol Saturday if he was surprised the Gang of 4 tanked his agreement with Reid.\n\n\u201cYeah, I was,\u201d replied McConnell.\n\nSenators were stunned.\n\n\u201c(Former Senate Majority Leaders) Trent Lott (R-MS) or Bob Dole (R-KS) would have never let something like this happen,\u201d complained Sen. Tom Harkin (D-IA). \u201cThey\u2019re not punishing Democrats. They\u2019re punishing Republicans. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so bizarre.\u201d\n\nRepublican senators chafed at their colleagues\u2019 immigration gambit.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been to this movie before. And I wouldn\u2019t pay money to go see it again,\u201d said Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-GA).\n\n\u201cYou should have a goal in sight rather than just irritating a lot of people,\u201d seethed Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT), the most senior GOPer in the body. \u201cThis is not an effective strategy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI fail to see what conservative ends are achieved,\u201d said Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ).\n\n\u201cWe should fight when we can win,\u201d added Sen. John Hoeven (R-ND).\n\nThe volatile state of affairs was not lost on Senate Chaplain Barry Black when he delivered the opening prayer for Saturday\u2019s Senate session.\n\n\u201cEmpower (senators) to make their decisions after weighing them on the scale of long-term consequences,\u201d beseeched Black.\n\nAt one point, a scrum of reporters briefly descended on Cruz as he hustled into the Senate chamber. Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-MO) admonished the scribes from across the corridor.\n\n\u201cQuit giving him so much attention. That\u2019s exactly what\u2019s causing the problem,\u201d McCaskill chided.\n\nCruz lit into the GOP brass.\n\n\u201cEvery Republican campaigned they would do everything to stop President Obama\u2019s illegal amnesty. We didn\u2019t honor those commitments,\u201d he said.\n\nHaving Cruz back in the spotlight was like Christmas come early for Democrats. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL) engaged Reid in a brief back-and-forth on the floor early Saturday afternoon.\n\n\u201cLast night the junior senator from Texas came to the floor. Is he part of the group that is objecting on moving forward on the CRomnibus bill?\u201d queried Durbin.\n\n\u201cIt appears so,\u201d said Reid.\n\n\u201cThis is the same senator who shut down the government last year in protest over the Affordable Care Act?\u201d continued Durbin.\n\n\u201cThe very same man,\u201d replied Reid.\n\nSo with the Senate meeting Saturday, Reid used the time to tee up a host of President Obama\u2019s nominations. The slate included Vivek Murthy to become Surgeon General. The GOP won\u2019t be as game to advance these nominations next year. So the Gang of 4\u2019s protestations over immigration on the CRomnibus actually appeared to enhance the chances of the Senate approving them before Democrats cede control to Republicans. Democrats railed against Murthy\u2019s stalled nomination this fall as the Ebola crisis deepened. Many Republicans object to Murthy because of his support for Obamacare (shock). In addition, the GOP and the National Rifle Association don\u2019t like Murthy\u2019s stance on firearms as a public health concern.\n\nReid filed for cloture to halt the filibuster on the CRomnibus Friday evening. By rule, one day must intervene before cloture is ready for a vote. So the Nevada Democrat planned to keep the Senate in session until that cloture petition matures petition Sunday morning\u2026at 1 am et.\n\nBut there\u2019s another issue. The House of Representatives narrowly vaulted a procedural hurdle on Thursday just to put the CRomnibus up for debate on the floor. Several sources noted that securing 60 votes in the Senate to stop debate on the CRomnibus was far from a done deal.\n\n\u201cThis is not going to be your typical 55, plus five,\u201d noted one senior aide. The remark reflected the 55 senators who caucus with the Democrats plus the five Republicans they must court for cloture.\n\nThere are lots of senators on both sides of the aisle who abhor the CRomnibus and may try to stop it overnight.\n\nIf the cloture vote goes south, everything disintegrates. The Senate can\u2019t finish the CRomnibus. That means the House probably has to return to full session next week as both bodies struggle to forge a bill which can pass. At least they would have until Wednesday night, as both bodies approved a second, stopgap spending bill to avoid an immediate government shutdown.\n\nBut if the Senate secures 60 votes early Sunday morning, a possible Cruz point of order vote and final passage on the CRomnibus may not happen until sometime after 7 am Monday. Senate rules afford senators an additional 30 hours of debate after cloture. So, it's possible this saga could play out through the first of the workweek.\n\nIt\u2019s enough to make people lose their holiday cheer, not that there seemed to be much of it going around the halls of Congress this year.\n\nAnd besides the CRomnibus, work in the Senate is far from complete. It also faces of batch of nominations needing confirmation to say nothing of a terrorism risk insurance bill and tax break legislation.\n\n\u201cWe could be in session next weekend, too,\u201d proffered one senior aide.", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX NEWS/COLUMNS/Capitol Attitude", "dcterms.modified": "2015-01-22 04:17:35 EST", "dc.type": "Text.Article", "twitter": {"description": "More than 30 years ago, Sen.
