We are learning about ourselves, and we are teaching others about ourselves.\u201d\n\nThursday\u2019s event included several displays and information about Kwanzaa, as well as music and food.\n\nWhile the seven days of Kwanzaa includes gift-giving, Jupiter said more emphasis is placed on learning and reflecting on the Ngzo Saba, or seven principles assigned to each day.\n\nThe principles are unity, self-determination, collective works and responsibility, cooperative economics, purpose, creativity and faith.\n\n\u201cKwanza isn\u2019t about religion; it\u2019s about those principles,\u201d Jupiter said. \u201cIt is about connecting with that umbilical to our past, and looking to our future.\u201d\n\nJupiter said the group plans to hold an information session each night relating to the seven principles.\n\nOn Thursday, representatives from the Texas State NAACP gave a presentation on the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cTonight is about unity, and we wanted to bring people in the community together, and give them chance to learn more about the ACA and answer any questions they might have,\u201d said Phyllis Jones, the education chair for the Texas State NAACP.\n\nTalks on disaster preparedness, financial literacy, and mental and spiritual health are slated for the remaining six nights of Kwanzaa. Jupiter said the events are free and invited local residents to attend.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Killeen Daily Herald", "description": "A local nonprofit organization is inviting the community to come together and celebrate Kwanzaa by hosting seven days of celebration and education.", "title": "Community invited to celebrate Kwanzaa", "url": "http://kdhnews.com/news/community-invited-to-celebrate-kwanzaa/article_4fe64750-6ebb-11e3-afd9-001a4bcf6878.html", "image": {"width": 620, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/kdhnews.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/5/78/578cf884-6ea0-11e3-93e4-001a4bcf6878/52bce8c6c2193.preview-620.jpg?resize=620%2C431", "height": 431}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kdhnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@"}, "description": "A local nonprofit organization is inviting the community to come together and celebrate Kwanzaa by hosting seven days of celebration and education.", "msvalidate.01": "9F304B519542CC4AA866533D2B53AECA", "fb": {"app_id": 496799633680125}, "google-site-verification": "tvpDrly4oWZOJdt-kIl4RYZzursFYwXuQ-Ejs4m1V5k", "keywords": "kwanzaa,ethnic groups in africa,african-american culture,maulana karenga,ron jupiter,african people,songhai bamboo roots,local,moss rose community center,news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/facebook.com/kdhnews"}, "news_keywords": "kwanzaa,ethnic groups in africa,african-american culture,maulana karenga,ron jupiter,african people,songhai bamboo roots,local,moss rose community center,news"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9b1c\"", "article_summary": "A local nonprofit organization is inviting the community to come together and celebrate Kwanzaa by hosting seven days of celebration and education.\nOn Thursday, representatives from the Texas State NAACP gave a presentation on the Affordable Care Act.\nSonghai Bamboo Roots, a local group that provides cultural awareness programs to area youth, kicked off its annual Kwanzaa celebration Thursday at the Moss Rose Community Center in Killeen.\n\u201cKwanza isn\u2019t about religion; it\u2019s about those principles,\u201d Jupiter said.\nTalks on disaster preparedness, financial literacy, and mental and spiritual health are slated for the remaining six nights of Kwanzaa."}
