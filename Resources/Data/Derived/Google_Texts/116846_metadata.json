This revenue growth is attributed to an increase in the company\u2019s MA (Medicare Advantage) and Medicare supplement membership.\n\nHumana derives about 63.8% of its total revenues from Medicare enrollments. In 1Q15, the company\u2019s total Medicare enrollments increased sequentially by 625,600 members.\n\nMedicare enrollments\n\nHumana witnessed a rise of 12.4% in its total MA enrollments from 2.81 million in 1Q14 to 3.16 million in 1Q15. This was mainly a result of the company\u2019s individual MA enrollments increasing year-over-year by 15.2%, from 2.3 million in 1Q14 to 2.7 million in 1Q15. However, Humana\u2019s employer-sponsored MA enrollments for retirees declined by 6,700 members or by 1.4% in the same time period, mainly as a result of the company losing a large employer client in 4Q14.\n\nAfter several years, the federal government has announced a 1.25% increase in MA payment rates for 2016. This change is also expected to yield unexpected profits for Humana and its peers such as Cigna (CI), WellCare Health Plans (WCG), and UnitedHealth Group (UNH). However, the rate rise continues to lag behind the medical cost trends, which can affect future margins.\n\nIntegrated care delivery\n\nIn 1Q15, Humana also improved its integrated care delivery model metrics. Though there was a substantial rise in the company\u2019s individual Medicare enrollments, approximately 54% of its individual membership is covered by value-based arrangements with health providers.\n\nIn 1Q15, Humana launched Transcend Insights, a population health management tool. Based on the company\u2019s enrollment data, the tool offers business and clinical insights to health providers (XLV). This information has enabled the providers to increasingly enter value-based reimbursement arrangements with Humana, which leads to higher star ratings, lower medical costs, and greater patient satisfaction.\n\nHumana also witnessed a sequential rise of 10% in its Chronic Care program membership in 1Q15. The company\u2019s increasing enrollments in HMO (health maintenance plans) from 53% in 1Q14 to 56% in 1Q15, combined with its integrated care delivery strategy, will likely allow Humana to sustain its pre-tax margin target of 4.5% to 5.0% in 2015 and also in subsequent years.", "article_metadata": {"cXenseParse": {"mre-primary-ticker": "xlv", "mre-content-type": "Post-Release Earnings Reports", "mre-author": "Manali Pradhan", "mre-industry": "Hospitals", "mre-value-driver": "Earnings Overview", "mre-page-type": "post", "mre-section": "Sector Analysis", "mre-sector": "Healthcare", "mre-secondary-ticker": "ci"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.1", "description": "Humana\u2019s (HUM) revenues from Medicare enrollments increased by 12.5%, from $7.84 billion in 1Q14 to $8.82 billion in 1Q15."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1dd3\"", "article_summary": "This revenue growth is attributed to an increase in the company\u2019s MA (Medicare Advantage) and Medicare supplement membership.\nHumana's 1Q15 Results Miss Analyst Expectations PART 2 OF 5Strong Medicare Advantage Enrollments Help Humana in 1Q15Revenue growthHumana\u2019s (HUM) revenues from Medicare enrollments increased by 12.5%, from $7.84 billion in 1Q14 to $8.82 billion in 1Q15.\nMedicare enrollmentsHumana witnessed a rise of 12.4% in its total MA enrollments from 2.81 million in 1Q14 to 3.16 million in 1Q15.\nIn 1Q15, the company\u2019s total Medicare enrollments increased sequentially by 625,600 members.\nHumana derives about 63.8% of its total revenues from Medicare enrollments."}
