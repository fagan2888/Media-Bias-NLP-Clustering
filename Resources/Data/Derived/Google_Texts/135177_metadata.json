This unfortunate willingness to \u201cspring ahead, fall back\u201d to please Beltway insiders was first seen during World War I under President Woodrow Wilson, the Democratic tyrant who also brought us the Federal Reserve and the League of Nations.\n\nThe federal overreach was justified by the commerce clause, so often misconstrued to bless Eisenhower\u2019s interstate highways, the Environmental Protection Agency and similar despotism.\n\nWall Street loves it, of course, since extra daylight hours means more shopping. But the farmers who ostensibly benefited from DST when it was first imposed hated it \u2014 they had to milk their cows earlier and wait for dew to dry on crops. These agrarians who objected to the policy under Wilson even had a name for our good, old-fashioned and unregulated clock: \u201cGod\u2019s time.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, DST has been undermining American values for a century.\n\nExample: I am the father of a small child and the owner of a large dog. These creatures wake approximately eight hours after they retire, no matter how black the night. When, at 5:30 this morning, they entered my room to begin the day, I was forced to report that, because of government fiat, it was too dark to go outside.\n\nWithout the market distortions created by DST, the sun would have been blazing above our local playground. We might have strolled down our neighborhood\u2019s Main Street or enjoyed a picnic in a park by the dawn\u2019s early light. But, thanks to the government, I walked my dog and drove my child to school in the dark.\n\nHas Obama explained to my daughter and my dog why our polity has auctioned off its sunlight to satisfy big bankers?\n\nNo.\n\nWashington\u2019s crime against life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness hasn\u2019t gone entirely unremarked upon. In March, a New York Times editorial questioned the \u201cfeds\u2019 confiscation of more than 300 million privately held American sleep hours, taken for eight months without interest payments or a penalty.\u201d But the Gray Lady\u2019s editorial board, holding its love of late-night soirees above the interests of the American people, concluded that the government\u2019s overreach was justified by the benefit of \u201clonger dusks.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t think so. Manhattan media elites can press for laws that match their nap schedules, but real America ran by its own watches from July 4, 1776, until Nov. 18, 1883, when standard time was established to please railroad robber-barons. Though states can still opt-out of DST \u2014 after a hard-fought battle, Indiana surrendered as recently as 2006 too many are seduced by the siren song of a central government that tells us what to do and when to do it.\n\nLike all market interference, standard time upends our level playing field. Why should Gary, Ind., a city on the eastern edge of the Central Time Zone, see night fall an hour earlier than Kalamazoo, Mich., a city little more than100 miles away and on the Western edge of the Eastern Time Zone? Why should a hardworking farmer in Mountain Time have to wake up early to follow the lead of Manhattan commodities markets? Why should Californians have to watch \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d taped?\n\nThey shouldn\u2019t. We need to not just abolish DST, but allow states (and, eventually, citizens) to decide its own time. Call it Liberty Time: every member of our country\u2019s right to live by his or her own clock.\n\nSure, such a system might create initial confusion. Web sites might not work. Income tax e-filers might receive letters from the Internal Revenue Service informing them that, because of time-stamp confusion, their taxes hadn\u2019t been received. What would a pilot flying from Philadelphia to Seattle say when, upon final approach, a SEA-TAC air traffic controller explains that her plane isn\u2019t due to land for three hours?\n\nI\u2019m not sure.\n\nBut I do know this: The citizens of a nation 3,000 miles wide can\u2019t be expected to set their alarms by Washington diktat.\n\nIn the long run, the invisible hands of the clock will guide us.\n\nMoyer is a musician and writer living in Washington, D.C., the home of oppressive time.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Justin Moyer", "twitter": {"description": "Moyer: In 1775, founding father Patrick Henry uttered his famous line about the colonies\u2019 need to shake off their British overlords: \u201cGive me liberty or give me death.\u201d", "title": "Hey Washington, get your hands off of my daylight", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/hey-washington-hands-daylight-article-1.1503884", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1503883.1383322448!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/spring.jpg", "site": "@nydailynews", "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.tags": "United States, Woodrow Wilson", "parsely-author": "Justin Moyer", "parsely-type": "article", "keywords": "United States, Woodrow Wilson", "news_keywords": "United States, Woodrow Wilson", "parsely-link": "http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/hey-washington-hands-daylight-article-1.1503884", "parsely-title": "Hey Washington, get your hands off of my daylight", "sailthru.date": "2013-11-03T04:00:00-0500", "sailthru.title": "Hey Washington, get your hands off of my daylight", "nydn_section": "Opinion", "parsely-pub-date": "2013-11-03T09:00:00", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1503883.1383322448!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/spring.jpg", "description": "Moyer: In 1775, founding father Patrick Henry uttered his famous line about the colonies\u2019 need to shake off their British overlords: \u201cGive me liberty or give me death.\u201d", "robots": "NOARCHIVE", "fb": {"admins": 1594068001, "app_id": 107464888913, "pages": 268914272540}, "msvalidate.01": "02916AAC0DA8B068EFE01D721E03ED7E", "parsely-section": "Opinion", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NYDailyNews/"}, "sailthru.description": "Moyer: In 1775, founding father Patrick Henry uttered his famous line about the colonies\u2019 need to shake off their British overlords: \u201cGive me liberty or give me death.\u201d", "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"site_name": "NY Daily News", "description": "Moyer: In 1775, founding father Patrick Henry uttered his famous line about the colonies\u2019 need to shake off their British overlords: \u201cGive me liberty or give me death.\u201d", "title": "Hey Washington, get your hands off of my daylight", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/hey-washington-hands-daylight-article-1.1503884", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1503883.1383322448!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/spring.jpg", "type": "article"}, "parsely-image-url": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1503883.1383322448!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/spring.jpg", "p": {"domain_verify": "78efe4f5c9935744af497772f68a0ee7"}, "nydn_byline": "Justin Moyer", "sailthru.credits": "NEW YORK DAILY NEWS"}, "article_summary": "But I do know this: The citizens of a nation 3,000 miles wide can\u2019t be expected to set their alarms by Washington diktat.\nMoyer is a musician and writer living in Washington, D.C., the home of oppressive time.\nWall Street loves it, of course, since extra daylight hours means more shopping.\nIn the long run, the invisible hands of the clock will guide us.\nWe need to not just abolish DST, but allow states (and, eventually, citizens) to decide its own time."}
