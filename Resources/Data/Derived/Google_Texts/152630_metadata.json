That amounts to nearly 1 out of every 10 TV ads in the 2014 battle for the Senate, according to a new Center for Public Integrity analysis of data provided by Kantar Media/CMAG, an advertising tracking service, covering spending from Jan. 1, 2013, through Sunday.\n\nTheir prominence has led to denunciations by Democrats, and praise from Republicans, as they\u2019ve bombarded incumbent lawmakers with negative ads and exulted conservative challengers. No other right-leaning coalition has been as active. Even the two main big-money committees co-founded by GOP strategist Karl Rove\u2014American Crossroads and Crossroads GPS\u2014have only aired about half as many ads to date as these six Koch-connected groups. In all, Americans for Prosperity, the Koch brothers\u2019 flagship political operation, alone has aired more than 27,000 ads in a combined nine battleground states, according to Kantar Media/CMAG.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nKoch-connected groups reportedly intend to spend $290 million to help Republicans make gains in Congress this November. Thus far, Kantar Media/CMAG spending estimates indicate the groups have invested at least $14.5 million. That amount is undeniably a conservative estimate, as it includes only TV ad buys\u2014not production costs or expenditures related to radio ads, online ads, direct mail, canvassers, or other activities. These so-called \u201cdark money\u201d nonprofit groups are not required to disclose their funders to federal election regulators, unlike candidates, parties, political action committees, and super PACs. And although election-related advocacy can\u2019t be the \u201cprimary purpose\u201d of these groups, they\u2019ve nonetheless established themselves among the nation\u2019s most powerful political forces.\n\nIn Alaska, the Koch-backed Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce has accused Democratic Sen. Mark Begich of \u201cstanding with insurance companies\u201d by supporting President Barack Obama\u2019s health care reform law. Meanwhile, Generation Opportunity, a Koch group focused on millennials, has argued that Democratic Sens. Mark Udall of Colorado and Kay Hagan of North Carolina are \u201cforcing\u201d young adults to \u201cbuy health insurance.\u201d And Democrat Gary Peters has been slammed by Americans for Prosperity for supporting Obamacare, which the group contended was \u201cmaking things worse\u201d for Michigan families.\n\nAmericans for Prosperity, the Koch brothers\u2019 flagship political operation, alone has aired more than 27,000 ads in a combined nine battleground states.\n\nThe top six Koch-connected nonprofits have hammered Democratic Senate candidates on an ever-expanding geographic field. Through the end of August, this spending spree has included about 8,600 ads in North Carolina, 6,900 ads in Louisiana, 5,800 ads in Iowa, 4,900 ads in Michigan, 4,700 ads in Arkansas, 4,600 ads in Colorado, 3,600 ads in Alaska, and 2,400 ads in Oregon, according to a Center for Public Integrity review of Kantar Media/CMAG data.\n\nDemocrats have responded in kind, using secretive nonprofit vehicles of their own. They\u2019re led by big-spending Patriot Majority USA, a \u201csocial welfare\u201d nonprofit run by a close ally of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid\u2014a pre-eminent Koch brothers naysayer who even maintains an anti-Koch page on his official Senate website.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nBill Allison, editorial director of the Sunlight Foundation, which advocates for transparency in government and tracks political advertising, said the Koch network is trying to make the Democratic candidates \u201cunacceptable to voters before Labor Day.\u201d Allison continued: \u201cYou only get one chance to make a first impression.\u201d\n\nWhen TV viewers see these ads, said Louisiana State University political science professor Johanna Dunaway, they may not yet be \u201cprimed enough to recognize\u201d the names or agendas of these conservative groups. Her own research has found that \u201cads sponsored by unknown interest groups are more persuasive than those sponsored by candidates or known interest groups.\u201d These groups\u2019 names sound \u201cbenign and credible,\u201d said Dunaway.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a real advantage to defining your candidate positively and your opponent negatively as early as possible,\u201d added Chris Mann, a political science professor at Louisiana State University. Ads from noncandidate groups, Mann continued, can help \u201coffset the incumbent advantage.\u201d\n\nIn more than a dozen states, the Democratic Party finds itself on the defensive, as Republicans seek to wrest control of the U.S. Senate away from them. To do so, the GOP must pick up six seats from Democrats, whose candidates, generally, have amassed a financial advantage and whose allies have fought back with TV advertisements of their own. As of midsummer, the five incumbent Democratic senators in the most contested re-election races had collectively raised more than $60 million, according to federal campaign finance filings. Their GOP opponents had collectively raised about $30 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe most prolific of these fundraisers was Hagan of North Carolina, who, as of the end of June, had raised nearly $17 million\u2014about 3\u00bd times the amount raised by her GOP opponent, Thom Tillis. Meanwhile, both Udall of Colorado and Alaska\u2019s Begich had each raised between double and triple the amounts of their Republican rivals. As of June 30, Udall had raised nearly $14 million, compared with about $5 million raised by Republican Cory Gardner. And Begich had collected roughly $8 million as of July 30, compared with about $4 million by Republican Dan Sullivan, who won a contested GOP Senate primary in late August.\n\nKoch-linked outside groups have helped Republicans cultivate support\u2014in a profound manner. In an interview with C-SPAN last month, Tim Phillips, the president of Americans for Prosperity, acknowledged that \u201cit\u2019s very difficult to beat a sitting United States senator.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe incumbent Democrat senators who are up, their only chance is to make this about personalities or politics,\u201d he continued. \u201cIf it's on the issues or their performance, they're probably goners.\u201d\n\nIn these battleground states, many Republicans are grateful for the outside assistance. Kermit Parks, chairman of Union County Republican Party in Arkansas, called the anti-Obamacare ads from Americans for Prosperity that criticize incumbent Democratic Sen. Mark Pryor \u201cmoney well spent.\u201d Steve Lux, chairman of the Saline County Republican Party in Arkansas, agrees. \u201cObviously everybody says they hate negative ads, but they do have an effect,\u201d Lux said.\n\nDemocrats, though, remain defiant. \u201cSen. Pryor has withstood this unprecedented onslaught and remains in a good position to win this race,\u201d campaign spokesman Erik Dorey said. These big-money conservative groups, Dorey added, \u201cdon\u2019t have Arkansans\u2019 best interests at heart.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.subheadline": "The GOP\u2019s Senate hopes have been energized by an ad blitz from the billionaire conservative brothers.", "fb-share": "The Kochs\u2019 Amazing Political Ad Machine", "sailthru.author": "Michael Beckel", "description": "The secretive political network of conservative billionaires Charles and David Koch has aired more than 43,900 television ads this election cycle in an ...", "og": {"site_name": "Slate Magazine", "description": "The secretive political network of conservative billionaires Charles and David Koch has aired more than 43,900 television ads this election cycle in an ...", "title": "The Kochs\u2019 Amazing Political Ad Machine", "url": "http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/09/david_and_charles_koch_s_political_ad_machine_the_conservative_billionaires.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/09/140903_POL_DavidKoch.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The secretive political network of conservative billionaires Charles and David Koch has aired more than 43,900 television ads this election cycle in an ...", "title": "The Kochs\u2019 Amazing Political Ad Machine", "url": "http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/09/david_and_charles_koch_s_political_ad_machine_the_conservative_billionaires.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/09/140903_POL_DavidKoch.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "site": "@slate", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-09-04T05:00:00Z", "sailthru.promoheadline": "The Kochs\u2019 Amazing Political Ad Machine", "sailthru.headline": "The Kochs\u2019 Political Ad Machine", "parsely-page": "{\n  \"title\": \"The Kochs\\u2019 Amazing Political Ad Machine\",\n  \"link\": \"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/09/david_and_charles_koch_s_political_ad_machine_the_conservative_billionaires.html\",\n  \"image_url\": \"http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/09/140903_POL_DavidKoch.jpg.CROP.thumbnail-small.jpg\",\n  \"type\": \"post\",\n  \"post_id\": \"100140904001\",\n  \"pub_date\": \"2014-09-04T05:00:00Z\",\n  \"section\": \"News and Politics\",\n  \"author\": \"Michael Beckel\",\n  \"tags\": [\n    \"politics\",\n    \"koch brothers\",\n    \"david koch\",\n    \"charles Koch\",\n    \"republicans\",\n    \"democrats\",\n    \"campaign finance\",\n    \"2014 elections\"\n  ]\n}", "fb": {"app_id": 142011022527753}, "tw-line": "The Kochs brothers\u2019 amazing political ad machine", "google-site-verification": "jXqoqqPSmx_PWchRdG-IXu-X616Ee2Ptf_AiElI9LzQ", "keywords": "Charles Koch, David Koch, Kochs\u2019 ad, Americans for Prosperity, Kochs Citizen United Kochs dark money, Kochs\u2019 TV ads, Kochs\u2019 Senate races, Koch Republicans, Koch GOP,  Americans for Prosperity Senate, Americans for Prosperity GOP", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/Slate"}, "sailthru.tags": "Charles Koch, David Koch, Kochs\u2019 ad, Americans for Prosperity, Kochs Citizen United Kochs dark money, Kochs\u2019 TV ads, Kochs\u2019 Senate races, Koch Republicans, Koch GOP,  Americans for Prosperity Senate, Americans for Prosperity GOP", "sailthru.description": "The secretive political network of conservative billionaires Charles and David Koch has aired more than 43,900 television ads this election cycle in an ...", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/09/140903_POL_DavidKoch.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "That amount is undeniably a conservative estimate, as it includes only TV ad buys\u2014not production costs or expenditures related to radio ads, online ads, direct mail, canvassers, or other activities.\nThrough the end of August, this spending spree has included about 8,600 ads in North Carolina, 6,900 ads in Louisiana, 5,800 ads in Iowa, 4,900 ads in Michigan, 4,700 ads in Arkansas, 4,600 ads in Colorado, 3,600 ads in Alaska, and 2,400 ads in Oregon, according to a Center for Public Integrity review of Kantar Media/CMAG data.\nAs of June 30, Udall had raised nearly $14 million, compared with about $5 million raised by Republican Cory Gardner.\nThe top six Koch-connected nonprofits have hammered Democratic Senate candidates on an ever-expanding geographic field.\nTheir prominence has led to denunciations by Democrats, and praise from Republicans, as they\u2019ve bombarded incumbent lawmakers with negative ads and exulted conservative challengers."}
