The opinion pointed the Obama administration and suing religious groups to an unusual proposal the justices floated in March after arguments suggested a possible 4-4 deadlock.\n\nThe decision is the clearest indication yet of the difficulties posed to the court by the vacancy created by Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s Feb. 13 death. With Senate Republicans refusing to consider President Barack Obama\u2019s nomination of Judge Merrick Garland, the vacancy may extend through the November election.\n\nAt issue was the Obama administration\u2019s plan for accommodating religious groups that don\u2019t want to provide birth control coverage for employees or students. The administration offered to give objecting groups two options: They could shift responsibility onto their insurer by providing it with a \u201cself-certification\u201d form, or they could notify the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services of their objection and provide contact information for their insurer.\n\nThe religious groups, which consider some forms of contraception to be the same as abortion, say they shouldn\u2019t have to play even the limited role envisioned by the administration.\n\nIn the court\u2019s March 29 proposal, the justices asked the two sides to consider an alternative approach under which the objecting groups wouldn\u2019t have to provide any notice at all.\n\nAlthough neither side fully embraced that proposal, the court\u2019s decision Monday said the justices saw reason for optimism.\n\n\"Both petitioners and the government now confirm that such an option is feasible,\" the court said.\n\nGet Crain's Morning Insider Sign up for the Morning Insider email and receive political news and musings every morning at 6 a.m. More Newsletters \u203a\n\nComments", "article_metadata": {"date": "May 16, 2016", "description": "With a 4-4 deadlock possible, the nation's highest court kicks the divisive issue back to lower courts", "pubDate": 20160516, "author": "Bloomberg News", "headline": "Supreme Court backs out of ruling on Obamacare contraception coverage", "section": "Politics", "title": "Supreme Court backs out of ruling on Obamacare contraception coverage - Crain's New York Business", "og": {"site_name": "Crain's New York Business", "description": "With a 4-4 deadlock possible, the nation's highest court kicks the divisive issue back to lower courts", "title": "Supreme Court backs out of ruling on Obamacare contraception coverage - Crain's New York Business", "url": "http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20160516/POLITICS/160519896/supreme-court-backs-out-of-ruling-on-obamacare-contraception-coverage", "image": "http://www.crainsnewyork.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CN/20160516/POLITICS/160519896/AR/0/Nuns-at-the-Supreme-Court.jpg", "type": "article"}, "image_src": "http://www.crainsnewyork.com/assets/logos/main-logo/C-200x200.jpg", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=626240088, app-argument=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/crains-new-york-business/id626240088?ls=1&mt=8", "keywords": "President Barack Obama, Politics, Small Business, Republican", "type": "article", "twitter": {"domain": "crainsnewyork.com", "description": "With a 4-4 deadlock possible, the nation's highest court kicks the divisive issue back to lower courts", "title": "Supreme Court backs out of ruling on Obamacare contraception coverage", "image": {"src": "http://www.crainsnewyork.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CN/20160516/POLITICS/160519896/AR/0/Nuns-at-the-Supreme-Court.jpg?maxw=800&imageversion=widescreen&q=70&cci_ts=20160516115314"}, "site": "@crainsnewyork", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "The opinion pointed the Obama administration and suing religious groups to an unusual proposal the justices floated in March after arguments suggested a possible 4-4 deadlock.\nAlthough neither side fully embraced that proposal, the court\u2019s decision Monday said the justices saw reason for optimism.\nAt issue was the Obama administration\u2019s plan for accommodating religious groups that don\u2019t want to provide birth control coverage for employees or students.\nThe religious groups, which consider some forms of contraception to be the same as abortion, say they shouldn\u2019t have to play even the limited role envisioned by the administration.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court backed out of a divisive clash involving religious groups that object to contraceptive coverage under Obamacare, issuing a compromise decision that said the two sides might be able to work out their differences."}
