He's not yet dotty, but he's close.\n\nBut then he learns that the most important building of his career \u2014 Marlowe House, an apartment complex in London \u2014 is going to be demolished. For many reasons (which become clear as the book progresses) he swore he would never go back to London. But he gathers his fortitude and determination and flies back to England to stop the destruction.\n\nNigel Packer's debut novel is an entertaining read about the preservation of one's legacy, the difficulties of growing old and the importance of making amends. An unexpected ending leaves the reader with a taste of sweetness \u2014 not a bad thing, in these dark times.\n\nLAURIE HERTZEL\n\nSenior editor/books\n\nTHE AXEMAN\n\nBy Ray Celestin (Sourcebooks Landmark, 428 pages, $14.99)\n\nJazz, booze, corruption and murder are blended together in this excellent thriller set in New Orleans on the eve of the Prohibition era. \"The Axeman,\" the first novel by Ray Celestin, draws heavily on an actual, unsolved ax-murder spree that set the city on edge in 1918-1919. In the novel, as happened in real life, the supposed killer sent a letter to the newspaper revealing his love of jazz and promising to spare people in homes where the music was playing. The tale gets better as Celestin spins an intricate plot layered with political corruption and fraud. The mystery is revealed through competing investigations by police and private detectives.\n\nDAVID SHAFFER,\n\nReporter", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "THE RESTORATION OF OTTO LAIRD.", "title": "REVIEWS: 'The Restoration of Otto Laird,' by Nigel Packer, and 'The Axeman,' by Ray Celestin", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/reviews-the-restoration-of-otto-laird-by-nigel-packer-and-the-axeman-by-ray-celestin/363951101/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_145159865422943.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_145159865422943.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "THE RESTORATION OF OTTO LAIRD.", "title": "REVIEWS: 'The Restoration of Otto Laird,' by Nigel Packer, and 'The Axeman,' by Ray Celestin", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/reviews-the-restoration-of-otto-laird-by-nigel-packer-and-the-axeman-by-ray-celestin/363951101/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_145159865422943.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_145159865422943.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "THE RESTORATION OF OTTO LAIRD."}, "article_summary": "\"The Axeman,\" the first novel by Ray Celestin, draws heavily on an actual, unsolved ax-murder spree that set the city on edge in 1918-1919.\nTHE RESTORATION OF OTTO LAIRDBy Nigel Packer (St. Martin's Press, 338 pages, $25.99)Crotchety retired architect Otto Laird is winding down his life, living in Switzerland with his second wife, writing crabby letters that he never mails, occasionally forgetting to put on clothing.\nLAURIE HERTZELSenior editor/booksTHE AXEMANBy Ray Celestin (Sourcebooks Landmark, 428 pages, $14.99)Jazz, booze, corruption and murder are blended together in this excellent thriller set in New Orleans on the eve of the Prohibition era.\nThe tale gets better as Celestin spins an intricate plot layered with political corruption and fraud.\nFor many reasons (which become clear as the book progresses) he swore he would never go back to London."}
