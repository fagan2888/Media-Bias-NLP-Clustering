In fact, every county in Middle Tennessee is medically underserved.\"\n\nDr. Dunlap and those associated with the local hospital have partnered with the University of Tennessee Health Science Center to create four new residency programs here: 1. Family Medicine, 2. Emergency Medicine, 3. OB/GYN, and 4. Surgery.\n\nHe noted that several issues are flaming the local physician shortage, but one of the primary issues is that with the exploding population, approximately twenty-five per cent of primary care physicians in the area are likely to retire over the coming decade.\n\nAnother concern is that the Affordable Care Act will bring thousands of new patients to an already over capacity market.\n\nHe told the Rotarians that with the four residencies now being accredited, St. Thomas Rutherford Hospital can now begin recruiting candidates.\n\nDr. Dunlap said, \"Our goal is to find residents who will be well connected to the area, and will establish practices here after they complete the training.\"\n\nThe first residents will begin the three-year program in the summer of 2015. The hospital is in the process of recruiting faculty, and have already purchased and renovated a building for the program at 1020 North Highland Avenue here in Murfreesboro.\n\nDr. Dunlap concluded his talk to the Murfreesboro Rotary club by saying, \"St. Thomas Rutherford Hospital will continue the mission of the Saint Louise Clinic, and grow the patient population to meet the needs of the residency program. By doing that, we will meet the needs of the locally underserved while providing an excellent opportunity for residents to practice and train under the supervision of seasoned physicians.\"\n\nThe Murfreesboro Rotary Club meets at noon every Tuesday in the ballroom of the Stones River Country Club. It was chartered 94-years ago. One of Rotary's primary goals is to eradicate polio worldwide. Since that project began almost thirty-years ago, the number of children suffering from this crippling disease dropped from 350,000 to only a few hundred.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "description": "Within an hour after being accredited, Dr. Chris Dunlap told Murfreesboro Rotary members about a new residency program at St. Thomas Rutherford Hospital.", "og": {"site_name": "Murfreesboro News and Radio", "description": "Within an hour after being accredited, Dr. Chris Dunlap told Murfreesboro Rotary members about a new residency program at St. Thomas Rutherford Hospital.", "title": "Major Physician Shortage...Local Hospital To The Rescue!", "url": "http://wgnsradio.com/major-physician-shortage-local-hospital-to-the-rescue--cms-17875", "image": "http://bw-2e2c4bf7ceaa4712a72dd5ee136dc9a8-bwcore.s3.amazonaws.com/articles/DrDunlap1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "robots": "index,follow", "fb": {"app_id": 541876619166504}, "keywords": "WGNS, Murfreesboro, Tennessee, Rutherford County, high school sports, high school, MTSU, Braves, Smyrna, LaVergne, Middle Tennessee, TN, Riverdale, Siegel, Blackman, Oakland, OHS, RHS, BHS, SHS, LHS, Murfreesboro obituaries, obituary, obituaries, Murfreesboro news, Murfreesboro weather, Nashville, Woodbury, Cannon County, local events, local news, community events, Woodbury, good neighbor, good neighbor station, 1947, arrested, digital newspaper, Murfreesboro newspaper, Action Line, All Sports Talk, Talk radio, AM 1450, FM 100.5, FM 101.9, 102.5, The Game, Radio network, ABC News, ABC radio news, since 1947, Murfreesboro history, Rutherford County history, Murfreesboro pictures, WGNSradio, marijuana, dope, driving on suspended, DUI, DOS, driving on revoked, revoked license, suspended license, MPD, Murfreesboro Police, Smyrna Police, counterfeit, Murfreesboro arrest, Rutherford County arrest, teacher arrested, Murfreesboro Post, DNJ.com, DNJ, Daily News Journal, Gannett, Tennessean, Braves, Braves Baseball, Prep sports, Murfreesboro Prep Sports, Rutherford County Prep Sports, Rutherford County high school, Murfreesboro high school, Smyrna newspaper, Smyrna news, LaVergne newspaper, LaVergne news, Middle Tennessee newspaper, Middle Tennessee news, WGNS radio, WGNSradio, FM 100.5, FM 101.9, AM 1450, wgnsradio.com, Stewarts Creek, Rockvale, Christiana, Rockvale news, Christiana news, Barfield, Barfield news, Walterhill, Walterhill news, Walter Hill, Walter Hill news, Thompson Lane, M\u2019boro, Mboro, Nashville, MTSU Football, MTSU Basketball, Bart Walker, Scott Walker, Danny Page, Melissa McCullough, Bryan Barrett, Truman Jones, Sheriff Jones, Jon Dinkins, Donnie Johnson, Inside Sports, TRN, ABC, Tennessee Radio Network, headlines, stories, Murfreesboro headlines, George Plaster, willy daunic", "article": {"section": "News", "published_time": "2014-01-28"}, "Googlebot": "index,follow"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1a57\"", "article_summary": "He told the Rotarians that with the four residencies now being accredited, St. Thomas Rutherford Hospital can now begin recruiting candidates.\nWithin an hour after being accredited, Dr. Chris Dunlap told Murfreesboro Rotary members about a new residency program at St. Thomas Rutherford Hospital.\nHe said, \"We need approximately 160 primary care physicians just to meet the needs of Rutherford and Bedford counties.\nDr. Dunlap and those associated with the local hospital have partnered with the University of Tennessee Health Science Center to create four new residency programs here: 1.\nDr. Dunlap concluded his talk to the Murfreesboro Rotary club by saying, \"St. Thomas Rutherford Hospital will continue the mission of the Saint Louise Clinic, and grow the patient population to meet the needs of the residency program."}
