Reuters\n\nDoctors don\u2019t discuss their teen patients\u2019 sexuality on a consistent basis, a new study finds. But more than that, when they do discuss LGBT concerns, it\u2019s seldom with the language and tone conducive to building an environment safe enough to have such a discussion.\n\nWhile the American Academy of Pediatrics offers a set of recommendations doctors can use to broach the topic of sexuality and sexual identity with their younger patients, the emerging research suggests this advice is rarely followed, if effective at all. Understanding a 16-year-old\u2019s fear of coming out of the closet or negotiating their friend groups during uncertain times requires more than a canned phrase, the researchers argue. It takes a conversation.\n\n\u201cWhat the doctor asks or brings up about sexuality sets the tone, and gay and lesbian youth are very good about reading adults to determine who is safe to confide in,\u201d said lead investigator Stewart C. Alexander, an associate professor of consumer science at Purdue University, in a statement. \u201cThey ask themselves, \u2018Can I disclose this information to this adult?'\u201d\n\nAlexander studies health communication, and along with colleagues from Duke University, Indiana University, and the University of Michigan, the team analyzed recorded interactions between doctors and patients. Each patient was between 12 and 17 years old, their conversations with doctors about issues of sex and sexual attraction. In total, 49 doctors and 293 patients comprised the study.\n\nTo the lament of the researchers, doctors were able to carry on inclusive and open discussions only three percent of the time. These two traits make up the bulk of the study\u2019s concern, as teens who feel like they live on the fringe of their social circles often struggle to find ways to move back in. With the right strategies, doctors may be able to act as a helpful point of contact.\n\n\u201cThe physicians I know want to do a good job, so we\u2019re trying to identify best practices, and hopefully these examples will provide them additional context for strengthening these conversations,\u201d added Cleveland Shields, co-investigator and professor of human development and family studies at Purdue.\n\nSome of these best practices actually involve starting the conversation early, before the issues become a concern. A 12-year-old may not be sexually mature enough to discuss his or her feelings, but that unknowing could be used to both parties\u2019 advantage. As the child matures into his or her teen years, assuming the doctor has built a level of comfort, discussing sexuality will already seem natural, rather than a chore.\n\nMore generally, doctors can narrow the focus of their conversations to build trust. Asking questions like \u201cUsually girls your age start to become interested in boys or other girls or both. Have you started to become interested in others?\u201d and \u201cI know some teenagers who are attracted to girls. I know some teenagers who are attracted to boys, and I know some who are attracted to both. Have you started to think about these things?\u201d may go a long way toward breaking the distant and sterile doctor-patient dynamic.\n\nAnother strategy is to use the patient\u2019s friends as a foot in the door. Discussing what friends are up to is far less discomfiting than relaying personal feelings. But they offer the side benefit of getting teens warmed up to the idea of a frank discussion, especially one that\u2019s relatively close to home. Physicians can then switch back to a discussion with the patient that makes frequent use of abstract ideas, with references not to \u201cyou\u201d but \u201csomebody\u201d and \u201cpeople.\u201d\n\n\u201cOpen, inclusive conversations can help youths realize there is no threat, and this can be a great start for building trust with the physician who is someone they are likely to see year after year,\u201d Shields said. This is especially true, he adds, as doctors strive to empower their patients and give them a sense of independence. \u201cWe want to provide them with autonomy so they can be a consumer of their own health.\u201d\n\nSource: Alexander S, Fortenberry J, Pollak K, Bravender T, \u00d8stbye T, Shields C.
