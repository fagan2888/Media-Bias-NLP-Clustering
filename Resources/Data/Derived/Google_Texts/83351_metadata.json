The tax is also designed to slow the growth of healthcare costs past the decade mark, Van de Water said.\u201cIt's a lot of money, and in particular it's much more significant in the longer term than in the near term,\u201d he said.The Cadillac tax has never been universally accepted, even by those who have championed the ACA. Labor unions have rallied against it for fear workers could lose relatively generous benefits. That has prompted calls for repeal from all three major Democratic presidential candidates. Meanwhile, President Barack Obama has stood behind the tax. Still, aides indicated that delaying its implementation would not be a deal-breaker for the omnibus budget deal.The medical-device tax has already been in place, but under the deal will be frozen for two years.Van de Water said that pause will have a much smaller effect than changes to the Cadillac tax, as will a delay of the annual tax on insurance providers also in the agreement.Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the conservative American Action Forum, said in a post on the organization's website Tuesday that Republicans should repeal the ACA taxes because they are \"bad tax policy.\"\"It harms Americans and hinders overall economic growth,\" he said. \"Conservatives should fight against bad policy to the extent politically feasible at every given opportunity.\"", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#0a365e", "description": "The Cadillac tax on high-end insurance plans and the annual tax on health insurance companies would be delayed while the medical-device tax is paused for two years.", "title": "Omnibus budget deal includes ACA tax delays", "og": {"site_name": "Modern Healthcare", "description": "The Cadillac tax on high-end insurance plans and the annual tax on health insurance companies would be delayed while the medical-device tax is paused for two years.", "title": "Omnibus budget deal includes ACA tax delays", "url": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20151215/news/151219911", "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/mh-logo-fb-lg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com", "description": "The Cadillac tax on high-end insurance plans and the annual tax on health insurance companies would be delayed while the medical-device tax is paused for two years.", "title": "Omnibus budget deal includes ACA tax delays", "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/mh-logo-twitter.jpg", "creator": "@modrnhealthcr", "site": "@modrnhealthcr", "card": "summary"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Modern Healthcare", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "url": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20151215/news/151219911", "published_at": "2015-12-15", "msapplication-TileImage": "https:/raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/ms-touch-icon-144x144-precomposed.png", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/mh-logo-g-plus.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "\"Conservatives should fight against bad policy to the extent politically feasible at every given opportunity.\"\nLabor unions have rallied against it for fear workers could lose relatively generous benefits.\nThat has prompted calls for repeal from all three major Democratic presidential candidates.\nMeanwhile, President Barack Obama has stood behind the tax.\n\"\"It harms Americans and hinders overall economic growth,\" he said."}
