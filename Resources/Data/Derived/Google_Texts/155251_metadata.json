His anguish still visible on Wednesday, as he announced he would not seek the presidency, Biden said he was making a \u201cpersonal\u201d commitment to seek instead a cure for cancer; as he put it, \u201cI\u2019m going to spend the next 15 months in this office pushing as hard as I can to accomplish this.\u201d\n\nMoreover, Biden went further: He summoned up the memory of John F. Kennedy\u2014a hero to most Americans, and all Democrats\u2014when he called for \u201ca moon shot in this country to cure cancer.\u201d That\u2019s some ambitious thinking; as we all know, the Apollo project, landing astronauts on the moon in 1969, was one of the great triumphs of American history.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nBut of course, it\u2019s easy to see why Biden feels as he does about cancer\u2014 and it\u2019s also easy to see that most Americans agree with him. After all, some 600,000 Americans die from the disease every year; cancer has been called \u201cThe Emperor of Maladies\u201d for good reason.\n\nOkay, so much for personality, -now let\u2019s get to politics.\n\nFor all the nobility of Biden\u2019s personal sentiments, on a political level, it\u2019s impossible to listen to the Vice President and not feel a sense of exasperation. And that\u2019s because we\u2019ve heard this beat-cancer pitch before from the Obama administration\u2014and from an even more senior official. That would be President Obama himself, whose mother died of ovarian cancer in 1995.\n\nWay back on February 24, 2009, in his very first appearance before a joint session of Congress, Obama touted his economic recovery program, and he included these words about cancer: \u201cOur recovery plan will\u2026 launch a new effort to conquer a disease that has touched the life of nearly every American by seeking a cure for cancer in our time.\u201d\n\nSo as we can see, nearly seven years before Biden\u2019s announcement, Obama, too, said that he wanted to cure cancer\u2014and of course, during that presidential speech, Biden was sitting just over Obama\u2019s shoulder.\n\nYet since 2009, some 10 million Americans have been diagnosed with cancer, and the administration has had little to say.\n\nSo what happened? How did the president\u2019s bold declaration about seeking a cure for cancer turn into such a fizzle? And what does that fizzle tell us about Biden\u2019s prospects for success in the remaining year-and-a-half of the lame-duck Obama administration?\n\nThe answer to that question, of course, is Obamacare. Yes, the fight over health insurance, passionate and heartfelt on both sides, has simply sucked all the oxygen out of any other consideration about health.\n\nSo, as a result, only a few non-Obamacare health issues have received much attention. One such issue, we might note, was Ebola, which erupted in Dallas in 2014. For a few weeks, attention was riveted on tragic Africans, gallant missionaries, and plucky-but-unlucky nurses. And in fact, the disease was arrested; what could have been a major epidemic was turned into just some isolated agonies, at least in the US.\n\nThus we are reminded that while health insurance\u2014including the debate over Obamacare\u2014is important, health itself is more important. If the Ebola outbreak had been allowed to spiral out of control, it would have done little good that victims had health insurance\u2014because they would have been dead.\n\nIndeed, the system\u2019s response to Ebola last year serves as a reminder that when establishment figures really want to solve a health crisis, they usually can. For various reasons, the Obama administration really wanted to put the kibosh on Ebola, and it did so. Yet meanwhile, as the late Beau Biden discovered, the cancer epidemic continues to rage.\n\nAnd so we are reminded of a basic disconnect between Washington, DC, and the rest of the country. You see, when real people think about \u201chealth care,\u201d they think of \u201chealth.\u201d As in, \u201cAm I well or sick?\u201d \u201cIs there a cure for what ails me?\u201d \u201cIs my family going to be okay?\u201d That\u2019s human nature.\n\nBut DC is different. Inside the Beltway, when politicos hear the word \u201chealthcare,\u201d they don\u2019t think of health, but rather, health insurance.\n\nIt\u2019s a bit of categorical confusion that afflicts DC policy wonks. You know, the men and women\u2014mostly young and energetic, willing to pull all-nighters to get their latest position-paper done\u2014who sit and do their work in the computer-cubicle equivalent of ivory towers.\n\nFrankly, both political parties are guilty of this categorical confusion: In 2012, the Republican and Democratic Party wonks hammered out their respective national platforms. And yet amidst a combined total of some 60,000 words\u2014in which Obamacare, pro and con, was attacked and defended copiously\u2014neither the Republican Platform, nor the Democratic Platform, even mentioned the word \u201ccure.\u201d Not a single mention, in either party\u2019s document. It\u2019s almost as if the wonks believed that the purpose of the healthcare system was to give them something to argue about, as opposed to giving Americans a better life.\n\nSadly enough, in 2012, Beau Biden had already been hospitalized with the cancer that would kill him. And only now, in 2015, is Joe Biden ready to take up arms against cancer. Better late than never, to be sure, but today, the sands are running out of the Obama-Biden Administration\u2019s hourglass.\n\nSo America\u2019s eyes are now turning to those who wish to replace Obama and Biden. Will they seek out a better healthcare vision?\n\nNo, not Hillary: Just last week, she crowed that the pharmaceutical companies were an enemy she was proud to have. It\u2019s hard to see how much progress against disease can be made without the drug companies on the team. One needn\u2019t be a drug-company stooge to see that drugs are a key part of any anti-cancer arsenal. And as an aside, we might recall that other enemies Hillary boasted about included \u201cRepublicans.\u201d You know, as in roughly half the country\u2014and majorities in both houses of Congress. So prospects for constructive bipartisan action in a Clinton presidency would seem to be nil.\n\nInstead, it\u2019s now the Republicans who are talking about cures.\n\nAs noted here in 2014, Rep. Fred Upton (R-MI) is leading an effort in the House. Earlier this year, as also noted here, GOP presidential candidate Mike Huckabee beat Biden to the \u201cmoon shot\u201d punch; as Huckabee said, if we did it before, we can do it again. And Sen. Roger Wicker (R-MS), a member of the Senate Commerce and Science and also he powerful chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee\u2014the campaign arm for the Senate GOP\u2014has unveiled the EUREKA (Ensuring Useful Research Expenditures is Key for Alzheimer\u2019s) Act.\n\nAnd now, perhaps most consequentially, comes a sitting US Senator who is also running for the Republican nomination.\n\nIn a new piece for National Review headlined, \u201cLet\u2019s Revive America\u2019s Culture of Cures and Innovation,\u201d Ted Cruz outlined a comprehensive assault on disease, fully deserving the appellation, \u201cCure Strategy.\u201d\n\nAs Cruz put it: \u201cIt\u2019s time to open wide the frontier for innovation. We have an opportunity to unharness solutions that could be the difference between a lifetime of pain and suffering, even death, and a life full of promise and strength. America has always chosen the latter, and I am confident we will again.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the voice of a Republican John F. Kennedy. And Cruz is not just talking, he is doing\u2014he has introduced bold legislation to reform the hidebound Food and Drug Administration. Alas, to be sure, nothing happens quickly in Washington these days, but it\u2019s also true that no goal is achieved without a solid beginning. And Cruz has made a solid beginning.\n\nObama and Biden had their chance to lead a pro-cures effort, and instead, they led us into a quagmire of health-insurance wrangling.\n\nSo it\u2019s fitting that the torch be passed to a new generation of Republicans.", "article_metadata": {"description": "On a personal level, it\u2019s impossible not to feel great sympathy for Joe Biden when he talked about his son Beau, who died of brain cancer in May at age 46.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "On a personal level, it\u2019s impossible not to feel great sympathy for Joe Biden when he talked about his son Beau, who died of brain cancer in May at age 46.", "title": "Joe Biden, Barack Obama, and the Unfought War on Cancer: Republicans Are Stepping Up in the Fight Against Disease - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/10/Biden-Obama-Getty.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/10/24/joe-biden-barack-obama-and-the-unfought-war-on-cancer-republicans-are-stepping-up-in-the-fight-against-disease/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "On a personal level, it\u2019s impossible not to feel great sympathy for Joe Biden when he talked about his son Beau, who died of brain cancer in May at age 46.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/10/Biden-Obama-Getty.jpg", "title": "Joe Biden, Barack Obama, and the Unfought War on Cancer: Republicans Are Stepping Up in the Fight Against Disease - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": ",Big Government, Medicine,cancer", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "published_time": "2015-10-24T13:19:43-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,Medicine"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "Obama and Biden had their chance to lead a pro-cures effort, and instead, they led us into a quagmire of health-insurance wrangling.\nAfter all, some 600,000 Americans die from the disease every year; cancer has been called \u201cThe Emperor of Maladies\u201d for good reason.\nYet since 2009, some 10 million Americans have been diagnosed with cancer, and the administration has had little to say.\nHow did the president\u2019s bold declaration about seeking a cure for cancer turn into such a fizzle?\nSo America\u2019s eyes are now turning to those who wish to replace Obama and Biden."}
