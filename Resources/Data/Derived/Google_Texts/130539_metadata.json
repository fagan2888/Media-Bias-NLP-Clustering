Our capacity to serve this population was very small.\u201d\n\nThat was five years ago.\n\nSince then, Kern Medical Center in Bakersfield has made great strides after 18 of its clinicians were trained in the unique needs of older adults at the UCLA-based California Geriatric Education Center. Spanning disciplines from nursing to social work and geriatric psychiatry, the program\u2019s success depends on a team approach that extends far beyond simple medical testing. The Center is headquartered at UCLA\u2019s Multicampus Program in Gerontology and Geriatrics.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about the doctor but about the pharmacist, the nurse and physical therapist (working together) to keep the patient out of the hospital,\u201d says Eckard, who coordinated UCLA\u2019s training efforts with Kern. \u201cWith these complex patients, the more communication that happens the better.\u201d\n\nKern Medical Center is a safety net for Kern County which, like everywhere in California, is facing a huge growth spurt in its older adult population. The number of seniors grew a full 1 percent between 2010 and 2014 and are now 10 percent of the county\u2019s population. This number will likely swell to nearly 20 percent by 2025.\n\nSo when UCLA came calling, it made Kern an offer it couldn\u2019t refuse. One of the state\u2019s three geriatric centers of excellence, UCLA had funding from the federal Health Resources and Services Administation to train clinicians at KMC, a 188-bed teaching hospital.\n\nOver the next few years, Kern employees traveled to Los Angeles and studied at home (with additional support from nearby Cal State Bakersfield) for nearly 200 hours of training in various topics: the shocking overuse of pharmaceutical drugs among older adults; the spiraling deterioration after falling; mental health woes; and the intricate interplay between social services and health.\n\n\u201cClinicians don\u2019t see the geriatric population as any different, when (in fact) they have very different needs,\u201d says Eckard. \u201cI didn\u2019t understand the whole breadth of it until I went through the training.\u201d\n\nHands-on experience was often the most powerful teacher.\n\n\u201cThe (UCLA) scholars program really put us in the shoes of our patient,\u201d says Dr. Warren Wisnoff, an internist at KMC. \u201cThey\u2019d have us wrapping our knees so they didn\u2019t bend so well, then put cotton in our shoes so we\u2019d feel the pain of neuropathy.\"\n\nA critical part of the program\u2019s success was including all disciplines, including social work, to connect elder patients with needed services in the community.\n\n\u201cSocial work is a huge component that often gets left in the dust of the conversation,\u201d says Eckard.\n\nEckard says the team approach often puts a physical therapist like himself at the center of care: screening for balance, visual impairments, even drug interactions that can cause gait problems and falls.\n\nIf there\u2019s a problem?\n\n\u201cWe do further digging,\u201d he says. \u201cWhile we had that knowledge (in the past) it wasn\u2019t as cohesive as it is now.\u201d\n\nSuffering from a series of health problems including diabetes and shortness of breath, former farm worker Madline Tello was a frequent visitor to the Kern emergency room \u2014 often weekly.\n\n\u201cWhen I went to the emergency room they\u2019d say \u2019Are you here again?\u2019\u201d recalls Tello, who was born in the center 64 years ago when it was called Kern General Hospital.\n\nSince the UCLA training \u2014 and the installment of new CEO Russell Judd in 2013 \u2014 Tello has noticed a vast improvement in both care and cleanliness. Instead of bad attitudes and unkempt facilities \u2014 she remembers \u201ctoilet paper everywhere\u201d \u2014 Tello heralds a highly responsive staff that is friendly and pro-active as it steers her away from the emergency department to needed specialists the same day she calls with health concerns.\n\n\u201cI feel special because I know they don\u2019t just call me, they call all their patients,\u201d says Tello. \u201cIt shows they care.\u201d\n\nKMC cares, yet the center also knows that once it admits a patient who returns to the hospital within 30 days, under the Affordable Care Act the facility is now responsible for the cost of these readmissions.\n\nThroughout California \u2014 and the country \u2014 healthcare providers are fusing behavioral and physical health.\n\nIt\u2019s a key component to the state\u2019s Coordinated Care Inititiative, which hopes to place most of the state\u2019s 1.1 million so-called \u201cdual eligibles\u201d into managed care.\n\nAt KMC, that meant big surprises for many of its clinicans, who were shocked to find the prevalence of late life depression, psychosis and schizophrenia, not to mention substance abuse \u2014 particularly opiods for back pain.\n\nThe UCLA training has spurred radical collaboration, says Dr. Rossano Bangasan, a geriatric psychiatrist and medical director for Kern County\u2019s Mental Health Department.\n\nOnce considered separate, every issue in a patient\u2019s life is now viewed as interconnected: from the drugs they take to medical test results, cognitive skills and social life.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s now becoming more of a collaborative effort between the treatment teams from different disciplines, with one comman goal,\u201d says Bangasan, who also sees patients at the medical center. \u201cFor (the) patient to feel better both in their physical and mental health.\u201d\n\nKMC has seen overall health improvement as well as a reduction in emergency room visits among its older adult population.\n\n\u201cWe set some pretty lofty goals when we started and basically checked them off the list,\u201d says Eckard, including \u201csenior sensitivity training\u201d and improvements in geriatric trauma, palliative care, podiatry, mobility, incontinence, fall prevention, and a host of other topics crucial to older adult health.\n\nAlthough KMC doesn\u2019t yet have a designated clinic for geriatric medicine, that goal is on the horizon. In fact, last year Kern opened its REACH clinic \u2014 based on the one-stop shopping philosophy of a \u201cmedical home\u201d \u2014 that serves as the inspiration for this future development.\n\nEckard says the UCLA training occurred just in time.\n\n\u201cGeriatrics was underdeveloped in Kern County and Kern Medical,\u201d says Eckard. \u201cThis population is not going away.\u201d\n\nThe California Health Report at calhealthreport.org is an independent, non-profit journalism project covering health and health policy throughout the state.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Travis Eckard readily admits he had little understanding of how older adults were cared for at his very own medical center. &ldquo;You know the biggest surprise?&rdquo; asks Eckard, a physical therapist. &ldquo;The lack of attention they got.
