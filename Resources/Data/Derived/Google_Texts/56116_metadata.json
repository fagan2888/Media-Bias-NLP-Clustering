Over a thousand liberty-minded Americans gathered at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California a week ago Sunday to meet and take in Levin\u2019s message as part of a nationwide book signing tour.\n\nIn Plunder and Deceit Levin references the wise words of President George Washington to President Ronald Reagan, noting Reagan was the last time Americans had the opportunity to vote for a true conservative.\n\nThis writer asked the great Levin about this importance of discussing change in America around the dinner table. He replied,\n\n\u201cThe whole point is the instrumentalities of government, even conservatives seem to believe that somehow they\u2019re going to redesign themselves or reform themselves and become responsive to the people.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not.\n\n\u201cI mean they\u2019re the problem. And same with their surrogates, whether it\u2019s the media or academia or Hollywood and so forth.\n\n\u201cI look back at the pre-revolutionary period when the colonists would talk to each other through pamphlets. They\u2019d sit down at pubs or the dinner table with their family. Word of mouth is an extremely powerful thing. Nobody can obstruct us. Nobody can stop us. We don\u2019t need to be vetted. We don\u2019t have to go through anything. (emphasis added)\n\n\u201cWhat I did in this book is I got through all the platitudes and superficiality and really dug very deeply into these various issues that I write about.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to get principles and arguments out there that aren\u2019t generally provided to people. Even when conservatives talk about it, they\u2019ll talk about it in very truncated formats, in very limited ways so I really enjoy talk radio and I\u2019m able to reach millions and millions of people, but my books allow me to get more cerebral, to provide scholarship, to provide heavy research to get behind my arguments.\n\nLaunching A New Civil Rights Movement\u2026\n\nPlunder and Deceit sparks the flame of a renewed and representationally faithful civil rights movement. In the final chapter Levin encourages the rising generation to, as Reagan stated in his Farewell Speech, \u201cpush back against teachers, professors, journalists, politicians, and others in the governing generation who manipulate and deceive them.\u201d\n\nAsked to explain the heart of this new civil rights movement, Levin responded,\n\n\u201cFirst of all I\u2019m tired of the Left monopolizing the nomenclature of civil rights.\n\n\u201cBig government is not civil rights.\n\n\u201cThe big government agenda is not civil rights and somehow they now monopolize that phrase and many of their hucksters pretend that they\u2019re civil rights leaders. Al Sharpton is no civil rights leader. So I argue that we need to take the language back. We need to take the movement back in a real civil rights movement. (emphasis added)\n\n\u201cA new civil rights movement would involve one that promotes individual liberty, the Constitution, national sovereignty, national security, and I argue that young people, after you\u2019ve read the first ten chapters of the book, check out the last chapter, the eleventh chapter because if they do not stir themselves to their own defense, they\u2019re going to face a calamity.\n\n\u201cEvery chapter, whether it\u2019s the debt, whether it\u2019s entitlements, education, immigration, the phony environmental movement and so forth and so on, these are all deleterious to younger people under 40 or 45 years of age. They all funnel the Left agenda, the big government agenda through them.\n\nWe\u2019re talking about destroying the economy, our financial system, destroying our economic system, destroying our culture and destroying our Constitutional system. And that\u2019s what the Left is all about, that\u2019s what they mean by fundamental transformation.\n\nThis has been going on for decades. It\u2019s particularly perilous now. And so, every survey will say that younger people don\u2019t trust authority or the status quo or politicians, but as an aggregate they vote for all three of them. So I try to unravel that and tell them, if you want to challenge these things then join us, those of us who believe in liberty and prosperity or you\u2019re going to lose your liberty and prosperity. (emphasis added)\n\nIs his book, Levin provides statistics and arguments specific to the importance of youth employment and the long-lasting effects of youth unemployment. Issues ranging from education to illegal immigration can have deep effects on the success of individuals in American society. Addressing this topic, Levin said,\n\n\u201cThe first thing is they need to read it because a lot of people don\u2019t read or don\u2019t want to read. So if we can get through the first hurdle and people actually read what I\u2019m writing from my perspective.\u201d\n\nThere are eleven chapters in Levin\u2019s book: Plunder and Deceit, On the Debt, On Social Security, On Medicare and Obamacare, On Education, On Immigration, On the Environment, On the Minimum Wage, On National Security, On the Constitution and A New Civil Rights Movement.\n\n\u201cI almost view them each as a separate pamphlet, about 20 pages each in plain English. Once you get past the first chapter you can move through and I tie each one of them to the younger generation and I explain to them how you\u2019re being exploited, and how your future is being destroyed by big, all powerful, centralized government. Whether it\u2019s 1.13 trillion dollars in student loans, what are you really getting for that? Now, although they\u2019ve nationalized it, still it\u2019s a huge problem.\n\nPamphlet five \u201cOn Education\u201d reads, \u201cIn 2011, over 62 percent of faculty members who teach full-time at undergraduate colleges and universities in America identified themselves as either \u201cliberal\u201d (50.3 percent) or \u201cfar left\u201d (12.4 percent) on the political spectrum, up from about 56 percent in 2008\u201d (when Obama was elected). As for the Right, \u201cConversely, only 11.5 percent of faculty surveyed (in 2011) self-identified as \u201cconservative\u201d and just .4 percent as \u201cfar right.\u201d\u201d This came as a downward trend from 15.2 percent \u201cconservative\u201d and .7% percent \u201cfar right\u201d in 2008.\n\nOn Immigration (pamphlet six)\u2026Levin told Breitbart News,\n\n\u201cYou even hear some conservatives say, you need to bring in more of these immigrants who have these high skills. You know they\u2019ll say you\u2019re right, high-tech, they call them STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics). And yet when you look at the real stats from the Census Bureau, you see almost a third of our graduates, American citizen graduates can\u2019t get jobs in that field cause we\u2019re importing people from other countries and the income is flat. It\u2019s been flat for years.\n\nOn Minimum Wage (pamphlet eight)\u2026Levin said,\n\n\u201cThe minimum wage, President surrounds himself with middle-aged people that talk about these people can\u2019t live off that. Well fine, most people on the minimum wage are young people. It\u2019s their first job, part-time job typically, unskilled, low-skilled and every time they drive up the minimum wage, the real scholarly studies show young people are put out of work, particularly in the inner cities.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how we\u2019re going to revive inner cities and get young minorities\u2019 jobs if we keep driving up the minimum wage. And then paradoxically we drive up the minimum wage and then bring in illegal aliens who undercut the minimum wage.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all aimed at growing government, empowering government, empowering the Left and I try to explain to younger people that all of this is destructive of you and your future and what do you do about it? (emphasis added)\n\n\u201cWell first of all you need to start talking about it. You need to understand who your real \u2013 I would even say enemy is.\n\n\u201cYour enemy is not liberty, it\u2019s not the private sector, it\u2019s not capitalism, it\u2019s not the Constitution, it\u2019s not legitimate entrepreneurs, it\u2019s not the United States military. It\u2019s the opposite of those things. It\u2019s the Left and big government \u2013 they are destroying our society. The bigger government gets, the more the civil society devours, then the less opportunity young people are going to have.\u201d\n\nShould people fight for liberty in California?\n\n\u201cAmericans, real Americans don\u2019t just give up.\n\n\u201cWe have young men and women overseas, in hell holes all over the place who are anywhere from 18 years old to who knows, 40 years old. They\u2019re actually putting their lives on the line so other people can live in peace and prosperity and when I get people who say to me look it\u2019s too late, I give up, I think to myself, you give up what? You aren\u2019t sacrificing anything. You\u2019re not even doing anything. When I get people who call and say what can we do? My answer is, no what are you doing? (emphasis added)\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve lived this. When I was 19 years old and in law school I ran for local office. I\u2019m not saying everybody has to. I have spent my entire life, whether it was in law school running for local office, serving in the Reagan administration, subsequent to that in radio, now writing books, supporting the Tea Party and other things.\n\n\u201cYou have different roles in life depending where you are and your age and so forth and so on, but everybody even a little bit in their own life, whether it\u2019s convincing a neighbor or young person around the dinner table.\n\n\u201cYou can make a difference. We are millions of Paul and Paulette Reveres and we need to take that power and use it. (emphasis added)\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need to be sanctioned by the RNC (Republican National Committee) or the media or anybody else. Just open your mouth, express the values of liberty, prosperity, Americanism.\n\n\u201cInform yourselves as much as you possibly can and I think we\u2019ll begin to turn things around, I hope so. The hour\u2019s late, there\u2019s no question about that, but I\u2019m not one to roll up in a fetal position and just give up. (emphasis added)\n\nLevin spoke of a recent caller who said his daughter couldn\u2019t address her values in class because her grade would be affected. He recalled getting angry and asking the man, \u201cWhat are you talking about?! Some teacher does that, you go into that school and you defend your daughter and you go to that principal and you confront that principal.\u201d\n\nHe continued,\n\n\u201cI never sat in the back of the classroom and took this from professors or teachers. You can prudentially and civilly speak up. You don\u2019t have to just sit there and regurgitate the usual left-wing pablum. So I\u2019ve taught my kids, and others can do the same thing, that you do not have to be a punching bag for the Left and you should not be \u2013 it amazes me.\n\n\u201cThe Left gets away with everything. They burn down neighborhoods. You can look at Bernie Sanders they interfere when he\u2019s giving a speech. We sit around and we\u2019re so concerned that somebody might have a problem with us and I say this in the last chapter: rally, protest and sometimes you might actually have to disobey. Not like the Left, you don\u2019t have to be violent and destructive, but sometimes no is a good answer.\n\nGiven the opportunity to share additional thoughts, Levin said the following:\n\n\u201cYou need to go buy and read my book. But you don\u2019t need to buy a lot of them; maybe one family can get it or get it at the library.\n\n\u201cI just want to get the message out there and there are only so many ways I can do it. I use every available tool I have whether it\u2019s radio or TV, guest appearances or books.\n\n\u201cI just want to inspire people to know that they can make a difference. I don\u2019t know where this is going to end 20, 30, 40, 50 years from now, but I do know this, however it ends, I just want my kids and grandkids to know that I fought like hell. And I think other people should feel the same way. (emphasis added)\n\n\u201cAnd the truth is, when that last breath comes, I want to know I did what I had to do and I didn\u2019t compromise my principles to accept the status quo. And I feel a lot of people need to be thinking about that too. We do not have to take this sitting down.\n\n\u201cThe destruction of our society is not inevitable, unless we surrender to it.\n\nLevin\u2019s book is being sold through many outlets and is already garnering significant praise for detailing the Leviathan government\u2019s aggressive assault on the future of those of us in the rising generation as well as the outlook for our children\u2019s future if Americans don\u2019t rise up and challenge the size and scope of our government overlords.\n\nLevin\u2019s book signing events have and continue to draw overflow crowds. At Bookends Bookstore in Ridgewood, New Jersey Levin was said to have signed over 1,000 books. This past weekend\u2019s signing at Barnes and Noble at Tysons Corner in Virginia saw similar crowds. The Reagan Library event sold out all 1,500 tickets in a record eleven minutes. His speech at the library can be viewed at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Library website. Costco in Boca Raton, Florida will host Levin for a book signing on August 30 from 12:00-2:00pm. Book signing dates and locations, book reviews and Levin\u2019s appearances and interviews can be found at the Mark Levin Show website.\n\nSpecial thanks go to Melissa Giller and the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation for their generous accommodation in facilitating this interview with Mark Levin and coverage of day\u2019s events.\n\nFollow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana", "article_metadata": {"description": "Breitbart News exclusive interview with Mark Levin on book Plunder and Deceit: Big Government\u2019s Exploitation of Young People and the Future.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Breitbart News exclusive interview with Mark Levin on book Plunder and Deceit: Big Government\u2019s Exploitation of Young People and the Future.", "title": "Exclusive - Mark Levin: Rising Generation, Push Back - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/07/Plunder-and-Deceit-by-Mark-Levin.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2015-08-24T11:16:46-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/08/24/exclusive-mark-levin-rising-generation-push-back/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Breitbart News exclusive interview with Mark Levin on book Plunder and Deceit: Big Government\u2019s Exploitation of Young People and the Future.", "creator": "@michellediana", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/07/Plunder-and-Deceit-by-Mark-Levin.jpg", "title": "Exclusive - Mark Levin: Rising Generation, Push Back - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Big Government, Constitution, debt, Education, Environment, Future, immigration, Mark Levin, Medicare, minimum wage, national security, New Civil Rights Movement, obamacare, plunder and deceit, rising generation, Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, social security, the left, young people,Big Government, Big Journalism, Breitbart California,Mark Levin", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-08-24T10:55:31-07:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/michdimoo", "section": "Big Government", "modified_time": "2015-08-24T11:16:46-07:00", "tag": "young people", "categories": "Big Government,Big Journalism,Breitbart California"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcde6a\"", "article_summary": "Launching A New Civil Rights Movement\u2026Plunder and Deceit sparks the flame of a renewed and representationally faithful civil rights movement.\n\u201cThe big government agenda is not civil rights and somehow they now monopolize that phrase and many of their hucksters pretend that they\u2019re civil rights leaders.\n(emphasis added)Is his book, Levin provides statistics and arguments specific to the importance of youth employment and the long-lasting effects of youth unemployment.\n(emphasis added)\u201cWe don\u2019t need to be sanctioned by the RNC (Republican National Committee) or the media or anybody else.\nBook signing dates and locations, book reviews and Levin\u2019s appearances and interviews can be found at the Mark Levin Show website."}
