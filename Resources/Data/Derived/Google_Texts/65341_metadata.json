Blame Congress for this one too, because they roped the IRS into the ObamaCare scheme without specifying the way the law should be applied, leaving that to Treasury to figure out. And that\u2019s worked as well as everything else in ObamaCare has, evidently:\n\nIn May 2012, when the Internal Revenue Service proposed its rules for Americans to get government subsidies for health insurance, officials acknowledged that a legal quirk needed to be fixed: The Affordable Care Act was written in a way that inadvertently denied such help to some people who live apart from spouses who abuse them, are in prison or are on the cusp of a divorce. The problem is that the law\u2019s authors, in creating tax credits to help pay for health plans bought through the new insurance marketplaces, had overlooked the fact that some married people file their tax returns separately. The IRS said in the preamble to those 2012 rules that it would correct the mistake, yet in the nearly two years since then, the Treasury Department has not made the change. And battered spouses have become the leading edge of a small army of people \u2014 legally married but filing taxes on their own \u2014 stepping up pressure to get an equal chance at affordable health plans.\n\nHow will Treasury deal with this issue? In the same ad hoc manner that the rest of the administration has so far \u2014 by ignoring laws and regulation in order to avoid the embarrassment of incompetent management:\n\nAs the first open-enrollment period for the new federal and state insurance marketplaces approaches its March 31 deadline, the Treasury Department is preparing to take steps this week to allow married survivors of domestic abuse to claim subsidies for health plans, no matter how they file their taxes, according to a department official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the decision is not yet public. Others who are married but filing separately will not get relief for now.\n\nWhy didn\u2019t the Obama administration act to fix this problem earlier? They\u2019ve known about it for two years. They should have realized the issue when the exchanges went on line nearly six months ago, too. With a week to go before the deadline for coverage, suddenly the IRS is reacting to the issue, as well as those involving legal immigrants and \u2014 I\u2019m not making this up \u2014 families with twins, which the exchange is incapable of properly handling.\n\nDon\u2019t ask Treasury. When the Post\u2019s Amy Goldstein inquired as to what happened, all Treasury told her was that they \u201ctake seriously\u201d the issue of abused spouses unable to access ObamaCare because they file separately \u2014 a tax status that has been around for decades. For everyone else using that status for whatever reason, Treasury plans to \u201cexplore ways to address the situation.\u201d When exactly they plan to do so is a mystery, as is how the system got built without figuring out that all tax filing statuses needed to be addressed, or how the Obama administration missed that some families have twins.\n\nSpeaking of missing the mark, Gary Gross notes that the Minnesota version of ObamaCare, MNSure, faces a demographic disaster:\n\nMore importantly, though, enrollment data shows a troubling low number of MNsure enrollees ages 26-34 are buying insurance. Estimates are that 40 percent of enrollees need to be in that demographic to provide baseline ACA funding. As of Wednesday, only about 20,400 (16 percent) were ages 26-34, well short of the ideal goal of 54,000.\n\nGee, why haven\u2019t more younger and healthier consumers bothered to sign up? The St. Cloud Times editorial board might have answered its own question:\n\nFee. Tax. Penalty. Fine. Individual mandate. Individual responsibility payment. Whatever the label, here\u2019s what the ACA\u2019s website, healthcare.gov, says those folks can expect to fork over via their 2014 tax filings. Pay the greater of these two formulas: \u2022 $95 per adult and $47.50 per child. The maximum penalty per family using this method is $285. \u2022 1 percent of yearly household income. Please note, that\u2019s in addition to paying 100 percent of your health care bills \u2014 which the government estimates to be at least $3,000 a household for out-of-pocket costs this year. Suffer any major health crisis and watch the tab you must pay in full double, triple or worse.\n\nThe problem? Most of the plans that these younger consumers can afford come with deductibles that far exceed the $3,000 out-of-pocket per household estimate, which sounds fantastically high in the first place, especially for that demographic. They will have to pay those deductible costs plus the premiums, which will also run in the thousands of dollars, before they see a single dollar in benefits. That\u2019s why most of that demographic got catastrophic insurance coverage \u2026 before ObamaCare took that choice away from them.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Plus, MNSure\u2019s demographic disaster.", "title": "WaPo: Married couples filing separately another ObamaCare \u201churdle\u201d", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/03/24/wapo-married-couples-filing-separately-another-obamacare-hurdle/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-24T12:01:29+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-24T12:07:35+00:00"}, "keywords": "incompetence, IRS, MNSure, ObamaCare, Treasury,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcebf7\"", "article_summary": "Others who are married but filing separately will not get relief for now.\nAnd battered spouses have become the leading edge of a small army of people \u2014 legally married but filing taxes on their own \u2014 stepping up pressure to get an equal chance at affordable health plans.\nThat\u2019s why most of that demographic got catastrophic insurance coverage \u2026 before ObamaCare took that choice away from them.\nWaPo: Married couples filing separately another ObamaCare \u201churdle\u201dposted at 8:01 am on March 24, 2014 by Ed MorrisseyBy \u201churdle,\u201d one presumes the Washington Post means \u201canother example of Obama administration incompetence that no one discovered until the law got implemented.\u201d Hey, po-tay-to, po-tah-to, right?\nThe problem is that the law\u2019s authors, in creating tax credits to help pay for health plans bought through the new insurance marketplaces, had overlooked the fact that some married people file their tax returns separately."}
