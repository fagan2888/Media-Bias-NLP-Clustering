The pay range starts at $31,254 for new employees with a bachelor's degree or professional certificate to $69,777 for a veteran employee with a doctorate.\n\nOTC was able to provide the 2 percent pay raise \u2014 the same amount given this school year \u2014 because of generating additional revenue.\n\n\"We had to have some increase from the state and we knew we'd do some tuition increase,\" he said.\n\nHigdon said the pay hike was designed to help the college stay competitive so it can attract and keep employees.\n\n\"OTC is a young institution and a smaller institution in a lot of ways. Our employees are incredibly productive,\" he said. \"Your job may be A but you may also do B and C.\"\n\nHigdon said the 2 percent raise does not extend to a \"small cadre of part-time workers\" or the 600 adjunct faculty, who are paid based on the number of courses they teach.\n\nHe said the pay for those employees will stay the same next year.\n\n\"We did raise them a couple years ago,\" he said.\n\nHe said the college also created a new position after the federal health care law was approved a few years ago. Under the law, the college had to limit how much it worked each adjunct faculty member or provide coverage.\n\n\"After the Affordable Care Act came in, we had a lot of adjuncts that were going to be disproportionately affected because the new law said they could only teach a certain number of hours. It reduced their hours,\" he said. \"We instituted the position of lecturer and we took long-term adjuncts, let them teach five classes a semester and we gave them health insurance and retirement.\"\n\nHigdon said the college wants to slowly move key adjunct faculty into lecturer positions. Right now, there are roughly 18.\n\n\"We saw that as a pathway to full-time instructor positions,\" he said.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://sgfnow.co/1SAJfEf", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The 2 percent pay raise for full-time employees of Ozarks Technical Community College is expected to cost $750,000.", "og": {"site_name": "Springfield News-Leader", "description": "The 2 percent pay raise for full-time employees of Ozarks Technical Community College is expected to cost $750,000.", "title": "OTC gives full-time employees a pay raise", "url": "http://www.news-leader.com/story/news/education/2016/04/27/otc-gives-full-time-employees-pay-raise/83544564/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/news-leader.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The 2 percent pay raise for full-time employees of Ozarks Technical Community College is expected to cost $750,000.", "title": "OTC gives full-time employees a pay raise", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b377be99644ef8c4875339d7db7f1c72c72fb188/c=0-0-266-266&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/04/26/Springfield/Springfield/635972801054641862-HalHigdon.jpg", "creator": "@springfieldNL", "site": "@springfieldNL", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=805766992", "fb": {"app_id": 164654783578465}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "OTC was able to provide the 2 percent pay raise \u2014 the same amount given this school year \u2014 because of generating additional revenue.\nThe OTC Board of Trustees recently voted to give the college's nearly 550 full-time employees a 2 percent pay increase for the 2016-17 year.\nHigdon said the pay hike was designed to help the college stay competitive so it can attract and keep employees.\nThe board also approved a new salary schedule, updated to reflect the raise, showing the pay range available to employees.\nUnder the law, the college had to limit how much it worked each adjunct faculty member or provide coverage."}
