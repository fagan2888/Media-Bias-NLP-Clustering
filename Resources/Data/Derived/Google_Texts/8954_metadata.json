That means 30,758 Nevada children gained health insurance during that one-year period.\n\nEven more striking, the study found that in Nevada:\n\n\u2022 The number of non-white children lacking health insurance dropped 4.5 percent, compared with 1.5 percent nationally.\n\n\u2022 The number of Hispanic children without health insurance decreased 5.5 percent, compared with 1.9 percent nationally.\n\n\u2022 The number of uninsured children in low-income families declined by 7.5 percent, compared with 1.7 percent nationally.\n\nWhile Nevada posted a number of significant gains, 10 percent of Nevada children remain uninsured \u2014 leading to a 48th ranking among all states and the District of Columbia. In 2013, Nevada had the highest rate of uninsured children in the nation.\n\n\u201cWe hope these gains will strengthen a bit in 2015,\u201d said Elizabeth Lukanen, deputy director of SHADAC, a health policy center at the University of Minnesota, which compiled the report. \u201cNevada started at the bottom, so it really only had one direction to go.\u201d\n\nNationwide, the number of uninsured children dropped by 1.2 percent from 2013 to 2014, continuing an overall downward trend that started in 2010. The report used data from the most recent American Community Survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nLukanen attributed Nevada\u2019s improvements to its Medicaid expansion, the rollout of the Affordable Care Act and overall better outreach campaigns to boost insurance rates.\n\nThe benefits extend to the entire community, she said, because healthy children tend to perform better in school than those contending with health problems. Plus, it creates a \u201cculture of coverage\u201d from a young age, Lukanen said.\n\nIn other words, children who grow up having health insurance are more likely to see it as a necessity in adulthood than those who don't, she said.\n\nAlaska had the most uninsured children (12.3 percent), while Vermont had the least amount of children lacking health insurance (1.2 percent).\n\n\u201cThis report provides an important baseline for measuring kids\u2019 coverage under the ACA across states,\u201d Lynn Blewett, director of SHADAC, said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s likely the case that more children gained coverage as eligible parents signed up for free or low-cost health insurance, and we\u2019re likely to see that trend continue.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The number of Nevada children without health insurance keeps dropping, especially among such historically hard-to-reach populations as minorities and lower-income residents, according to a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation study released ...", "og": {"site_name": "LasVegasSun.com", "description": "The number of Nevada children without health insurance keeps dropping, especially among such historically hard-to-reach populations as minorities and lower-income residents, according to a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation study released ...", "title": "Nevada makes strides in reducing number of uninsured children", "url": "//lasvegassun.com/news/2016/feb/11/nevada-makes-strides-reducing-number-uninsured-chi/", "image": "http://asset.lasvegassun.com/media/assets/images/icons/sun-app-large.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "//media.lasvegassun.com/media/img/staff/2012/jackie_valley_t120.jpg?74788340517f3aca400342a7031f857fc2b12fbe", "creator": "@JackieValley", "site": "@LasVegasSun", "card": "summary", "account_id": 12055942}, "fb": {"app_id": 112951308742607}, "vr": {"type": "text"}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-11T02:00", "author": "//lasvegassun.com/staff/jacquelyn-valley/"}, "verify-v1": "ABQIAAAA8L3JFDSZBbRKiOI0oC2hURQtzf2N5nUcl5FoJ4HJzSUUnGQdoBRCXoBzqBg3VizzahR0b1gDldhrew", "y_key": "33c272341f5beade", "news_keywords": "News,All,Aggregate,Breaking News"}, "article_summary": "Nevada makes strides in reducing number of uninsured childrenThe number of Nevada children without health insurance keeps dropping, especially among such historically hard-to-reach populations as minorities and lower-income residents, according to a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation study released today.\nAlaska had the most uninsured children (12.3 percent), while Vermont had the least amount of children lacking health insurance (1.2 percent).\nThe number of uninsured Nevada children dropped to 10 percent in 2014 from 14.4 percent in 2013 \u2014 the largest percentage decline among all states and the District of Columbia.\n\u2022 The number of uninsured children in low-income families declined by 7.5 percent, compared with 1.7 percent nationally.\nThat means 30,758 Nevada children gained health insurance during that one-year period."}
