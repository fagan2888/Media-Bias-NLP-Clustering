(WHTM) \u2013 As the state\u2019s medical marijuana fight stalls in the statehouse, activists haven\u2019t given up pushing for public support.\n\nOne of those demonstrating Saturday in York County was more recognizable than most: Chuck Homan was arrested on marijuana charges last year.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t know what else to do,\u201d he said Saturday.\n\nHe says he uses it to treat manic depression; last month, a York County judge said that\u2019s okay and found him not guilty.\n\nBut it\u2019s \u201cnot a real comfortable position to be in,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cI still live in fear.\u201d\n\nHe hasn\u2019t stopped using pot, which means he could be arrested again. But he still petitioned the streets of Hanover over the week, rallying support for medicinal cannabis.\n\n\u201cSeizures and stuff among these children,\u201d he said, \u201cconcentrations of CBDs definitely stop their seizures.\u201d\n\nCannabidiol, also called CBDs, is a non-psychoactive chemical in marijuana that\u2019s been identified as one of the main medically-useful compounds.\n\nDiana, 18, has intractable epilepsy. She\u2019s had seizures since she was 9 days old. Her mom, Louann Speese, of Mechanicsburg, found out about pot as a possible way to control them.\n\nThey went to Colorado, and it worked; but she couldn\u2019t get it here.\n\n\u201cSo I went underground,\u201d Speese said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve been using medical cannabis on my daughter since 2013.\u201d\n\nThe compounds are used in patches that look like adhesive bandages. Speese puts one on each of Diana\u2019s ankles, changing them every 12 hours. One patch contains cannabidiol, the other THCA, another compound in cannabis.\n\nShe knows she\u2019s breaking the law; she knows she might get caught. It happened once already.\n\nNot too long ago, Diana had to go to the hospital. Doctors ran a urine analysis and detected the compounds. County and state officials showed up to ask a few questions.\n\nWith two other kids, Speese said she understands the risks.\n\n\u201cYou want the best for your child no matter what,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I just want to give my child some type of quality of life.\u201d\n\nA bill to legalize the compounds for some conditions has lingered in the House Rules Committee since June.\n\nSome opponents in the medical community say the science just isn\u2019t clear yet. Still others just aren\u2019t comfortable giving chemicals found in currently-illegal drugs to children.\n\nBut some supporters say they just can\u2019t wait. They argue it\u2019s costing lives.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not about to keep quiet on something so unjust and wrong,\u201d Homan said.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\nGoogle\n\nPocket\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\nMore\n\nPinterest\n\nLike this: Like Loading...", "article_metadata": {"description": "As the state's medical marijuana fight stalls in the statehouse, activists haven't given up pushing for public support.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.mediageneral.whtm", "og": {"site_name": "ABC27", "description": "As the state\u2019s medical marijuana fight stalls in the statehouse, activists haven\u2019t given up pushing for public support.", "title": "Medical marijuana users rally support to change laws they\u2019re breaking", "url": "http://abc27.com/2015/11/15/medical-marijuana-users-rally-support-to-change-laws-theyre-breaking/", "image": {"width": 660, "identifier": "https://mgtvwhtm.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/marijuana.jpg?w=1200", "height": 371}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "ABC27.com", "description": "As the state\u2019s medical marijuana fight stalls in the statehouse, activists haven\u2019t given up pushing for public support.", "creator": "@abc27News", "image": {"src": "https://mgtvwhtm.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/marijuana.jpg?w=640"}, "title": "Medical marijuana users rally support to change laws they\u2019re breaking", "site": "abc27news", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "msapplication-tooltip": "News, weather, traffic and sports for Harrisburg, Pa.
