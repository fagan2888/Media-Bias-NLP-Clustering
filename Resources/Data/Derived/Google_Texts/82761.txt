Hayti, SD

The Hamlin County Sheriff says it started as a birthday party, but it ended with dozens of teenagers drinking, and 37 citations handed out by law enforcement.

This home located in Hayti hosted the party, but police say the people there shouldn't have been drinking this weekend. In all, 37 teenagers between the ages of 14 to 18 were consuming alcohol when the Hamlin County Sheriff's Office, Hayti Police Department, and other law enforcement arrived. It was a party Terry Wilen isn't happy to see in his quiet community.

"I don't really like the thought of having parties here in this small town, and I hate to see underage drinking around in this small town," Wilen said.

One of the minors was sent to the hospital with alcohol-related problems. The Sheriff's office says off the 37 teens cited for underage consumption, only one was from Hamlin County; most were from Watertown.

One person at the home didn't want to be on camera, but says she didn't supply the alcohol to the teenagers. She says a family member lied about what was going to happen at the birthday party.

The Sheriff's Department says the owner of the house, a 32-year-old man and a 19-year-old woman were arrested for contributing to a delinquency of a minor and other charges.

Wilen says he lost a family member to an alcohol-related car crash. He hopes that people, especially teenagers, think before drinking.

"I just say don't do it, it's not worth wrecking your life with that," Wilen said.

He's says he's happy that the party stopped before anything serious happened in the tight-knit community.

Sheriff Chad Schlotterbeck says the teenagers cooperated with authorities at the party.
