The NC House is one step away from passing a bill that would require unemployed workers to make five job inquiries a week (up from two) in order to receive jobless benefits.

Rep. Julia Howard told House members Thursday the legislation was intended to get jobless individuals “in the habit” of looking for employment.

But Rep. Yvonne Holley questioned whether Senate Bill 15 would have the unintended consequence of job seekers flooding employers with resumes, whether they were qualified or not, just to meet the higher standard.

Rep. Marilyn Avila suggested that the five job inquiry per week quota was certainly within reason for those truly looking to find work:

“If it’s an undue burden for somebody to make contact five days a week to find a job, is it going to be an undue burden five days a week to go to work?”

The state House could pass SB 15 on third reading Tuesday. Any changes to the legislation would need to be worked out with the Senate, which passed its version of the bill back in February.
