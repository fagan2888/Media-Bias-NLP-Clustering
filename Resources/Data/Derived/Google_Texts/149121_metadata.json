The idea is to make sure every knows what health insurance plans are available under the Affordable Care Act and also to ensure that at least 2.7 young Americans sign up, which is necessary for the state exchanges to break even.\n\nThe Supreme Court said the average health insurance and healthcare cost per year for twenty-somethings used to be $854. In order for Obamacare exchanges to break even the the projected cost those in the 18 to 35 age range to spend $5,800 a year per individual. Because of this there\u2019s even an Obamacare NFL marketing campaign which some have derided as a \u201cwar on bros.\u201d\n\nObamacare Penalty\n\nThe Obamacare penalty will increase over time, with the total fine for families of four reaching thousands of dollars by 2016. You must be signed up for health insurance by December 25, 2013 in order to avoid the Obamacare penalty. The original Obamacare penalty maxes out at $95 person or $285 per family, or one percent of the income for a family of four. In 2016, the Obamacare penalty maxes at $695 per person, $2,085 for the family, or 2.5 percent of taxable income, which amounts to $173.75 per month. The payment is made during the annual IRS income tax season.\n\nThe penalty is claimed to be necessary in order to increase the size of the health insurance pools. For example, Kathleen Sebelius famous said single men need to pay for maternity care coverage in their health insurance.\n\nObamacare will also cause about 16 million people, or over five percent of the American population, to lose their health insurance plans. For example, a former news anchor for MSNBC lost his health insurance plan. So President Obama apologized publicly over this issue:\n\n\u201cI am sorry that they are finding themselves in this situation based on assurances they got from me. We\u2019ve got to work hard to make sure that they know we hear them and we are going to do everything we can to deal with folks who find themselves in a tough position as a consequence of this.\u201d\n\nSome reports even claim President Obama knew this would happen for about three years.\n\nSelling The United States The Affordable Care Act\n\nBut health insurance ads are not so gloomy. They tend to focus on humor and the happy positives of the Affordable Care Act. Ads stress the \u201cpeace of mind\u201d that comes with health insurance and Oregon even held a music contest.\n\nTelephone operators for the phone help systems have been ordered to only mention the penalty if asked. State exchange websites barely mention the Obamacare penalty or tuck it away in the FAQ section. Even the federal HealthCare.gov website, now infamous for its glitches, renames the fee as an \u201cIndividual Shared Responsibility Payment.\u201d\n\nLarry Hicks, a spokesman for Covered California, says the health insurance ads are marketing Obamacare this way on purpose:\n\n\u201cWe feel that the carrot is better than the stick. This is a new endeavor. We want people to come in and test our wares.\u201d\n\nMichael Cannon, director of health policy studies at the conservative Cato Institute, claims the Obamacare penalty is being ignored on purpose:\n\n\u201cIt might be that they want to be positive. But it\u2019s also the case that an informed customer is not their best customer.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s issues like these that have people searching for health insurance plans that are Obamacare alternatives. But there\u2019s another side to the Obamacare penalty few mention. Based upon the current law the \u201cfederal government cannot use its usual tools like fines, liens or criminal prosecutions to punish people who do not pay it.\u201d This means the IRS doesn\u2019t have a plan for those who owed the Obamacare penalty but do not pay it, although it\u2019s possible the IRS could deduct from income tax refunds. But the implementation of such a tracking system has apparently been delayed so it\u2019s possible not many people will pay the penalty the first year of the implementation of the Affordable Care Act.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Health insurance ads being broadcast now are ignoring the Obamacare penalty and how some people are having their health insurance plans cancelled due to the", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "Health insurance ads being broadcast now are ignoring the Obamacare penalty and how some people are having their health insurance plans cancelled due to the", "title": "Health Insurance Ads Ignore Obamacare Penalty, Cancelled Plans", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/1025846/health-insurance-ads-ignore-obamacare-penalty-cancelled-plans/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Health-Insurance-Ads-Ignore-Obamacare-Penalty-Cancelled-Plans.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-11T09:59:08+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-06T06:35:14+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Health-Insurance-Ads-Ignore-Obamacare-Penalty-Cancelled-Plans.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2013-11-11T09:59:08+00:00", "fb": {"app_id": 164157850314499, "pages": 71179904752}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "obamacare,affordable care act,health insurance,health insurance ads,obamacare fines,obamacare penalty,obamacare tax,health", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Health-Insurance-Ads-Ignore-Obamacare-Penalty-Cancelled-Plans.jpg", "width": 670, "height": 409}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Health insurance ads being broadcast now are ignoring the Obamacare penalty and how some people are having their health insurance plans cancelled due to the"}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe3b9a\"", "article_summary": "Health insurance ads being broadcast now are ignoring the Obamacare penalty and how some people are having their health insurance plans cancelled due to the Affordable Care Act.\nYou must be signed up for health insurance by December 25, 2013 in order to avoid the Obamacare penalty.\nObamacare will also cause about 16 million people, or over five percent of the American population, to lose their health insurance plans.\nThe Supreme Court said the average health insurance and healthcare cost per year for twenty-somethings used to be $854.\nSelling The United States The Affordable Care ActBut health insurance ads are not so gloomy."}
