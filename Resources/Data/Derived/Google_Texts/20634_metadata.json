Michael Sears\n\nIt tells you how much modern dining has changed when a new restaurant that's retro feels fresh and distinctive.\n\nSupper opened in the Shorecrest on the east side this month, in an Art Deco space previously known for fine Italian food and a colorful past \u2014 colorful past being a euphemism for reputed organized-crime hangout, when it was Snug's beginning in the mid-1970s.\n\nSupper's co-owner is Gina Gruenewald, who also owns the Top 30 restaurant Wolf Peach; her business partner is the beverage director at Wolf Peach, Erich Wilz. The chef is Erik Hansen, whose cooking I admired a few years ago at the restaurant at Erin Hills golf course.\n\nGruenewald has said she's a fan of Wisconsin's supper clubs and wanted to open one of her own, tying elements of the classics with modern sensibilities.\n\nIt's a combination that worked when I stopped in to gather a first impression about a week after Supper opened \u2014 spot-on food, smart service and well-made cocktails (as well as interesting beer and wine lists).\n\nLike a proper supper club, Supper says \"welcome\" with food \u2014 a bread basket of tender rolls and yeasty slabs of marble rye with salted butter and lemon-herb butter, and a relish tray of raw and pickled vegetables.\n\nGuests can order a full Lazy Susan for $22, but with the relish tray already on the table, picking three items for $11 made sense \u2014 the rustic house-made braunschweiger, smoked trout mousse and deviled eggs felt very Wisconsin, even if the eggs were fancified with black truffle.\n\nThe menu keeps a foot in the past and in the present, categorizing main dishes as classics or modern. When so many restaurants serve small and shareable plates, the idea of a big ol' entree just for one feels revolutionary.\n\nOne of the classics is Delmonico steak ($42), a 16-ounce bone-in rib-eye with a fantastic crust and superior flavor, served with potato puree and bordelaise sauce.\n\nOn one of the modern plates, celery root, roasted mushrooms and a bed of smoked onion puree made gnocchi ($19) hearty; preserved lemon, peas and pea shoots kept flavors buoyant.\n\nCreamed spinach ($6), enough for two, was exemplary; the fresh spinach, chopped fine, was held together with cream sauce, so light it was almost souffle-like.\n\nAt dessert, Supper kept to its modern and retro sides. The baked Alaska ($10) was made from old-fashioned flavors (as in the Wisconsin version of the cocktail, orange and cherry) \u2014 a lovely classic that looked completely contemporary.\n\nFirst Impression provides an initial look at new high-profile restaurants. A full review will appear later.\n\nContact Carol Deptolla at (414) 224-2841, cdeptolla@journalsentinel.com or on Twitter @mkediner.\n\nSUPPER\n\n1962 N.
