Montefiore Health System, an academic health system which includes the University Hospital for Albert Einstein College of Medicine, has appointed Colleen Blye executive vice president and chief financial officer.

Blye has been leading large, complex health systems for 25 years and will assume responsibility for the system's financial strategy.

Montefiore President and CEO Dr Stephen M. Safyer said in a statement that Blye's experience "makes her particularly well-suited to help build on our rich history," adding that she should be well-suited to improve the organization's financial standing.

Blye comes to Montefiore from Catholic Health Services of Long Island, an integrated healthcare delivery system which includes six hospitals and three nursing homes. It was there that she served as executive vice president and chief financial officer, overseeing treasury management, revenue cycle, financial reporting and planning, third-party contracting, supply chain, accounts payable, payroll, and information technology.
