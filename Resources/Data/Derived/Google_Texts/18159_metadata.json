That\u2019s the most ever recorded \u2014 and a $19 billion increase from the previous year, according to a new report from the Government Accountability Office. For context, the steep defense budget cuts known as sequestration are projected to reduce spending by roughly $100 billion a year from fiscal 2012 through 2021.\n\nRelated: $74 Billion Food Stamp Program in Budget Crosshairs\n\nThe GAO\u2019s tally accounted for erroneous payments across 124 programs under 22 federal agencies. However, just three programs \u2014 Medicare, Medicaid and the Earned Income Tax Credit \u2014 accounted for more than $80.9 billion of the total.\n\nAuditors blamed these three programs for the uptick in improper payments overall. All three experienced an increased error rate from the year before. Across the government, the errors amounted to 4.5 percent of program outlays, up from 4 percent in fiscal 2013.\n\nTogether, Medicare and Medicaid paid out $77.4 billion in improper payments, a 20.4 percent increase over 2013. The programs combined represent about 62 percent of total improper payments government-wide.\n\nThe auditors explained that the increase was driven by errors in Medicare\u2019s Fee-for-Service program, which pays doctors for each service they provide. Problematic payments from Medicare alone climbed from $36 billion in 2013 to $45.7 billion last year. The error rate for the Medicare program was 12.7 percent.\n\nLikewise, Medicaid jumped from $14.4 billion in 2013 to nearly $17.5 billion last year.\n\nThe GAO defines improper payments as payments that \u201cshould not have been made or were made for the incorrect amount.\u201d Some of this includes fraud, while others include under and overpayments made by the government.\n\nIn 2013, about $97 billion of total improper payments were overpayments, while $9 billion were underpayments, according to data from paymentaccuracy.gov.\n\nRelated: Food Stamp Use Plummets Amid Job Growth\n\nLast year\u2019s uptick in improper payments comes despite the federal government\u2019s attempts to rein in the problem. In 2010, Congress required all federal agencies\u2019 inspector generals to track whether they were making progress.\n\nFrom then until last year, agencies had made steady progress on trimming down erroneous payments. However, the number shot back up in 2014.\n\n\"While progress has been made over the years, the time has come for a more aggressive strategy to reduce the levels of improper payments we currently are seeing,\" David Mader, controller at the Office of Management and Budget said during a hearing on the GAO\u2019s report on Monday.\n\nOther programs that receive dishonorable mention for handing out billions in improper payments last year include Medicare Advantage, which paid out $12.2 billion, federal unemployment insurance, which paid out $5.6 billion, and Supplementary Social Security, which doled out $5.1 billion in improper payments.\n\n\u201cIf we're going to get a better handle on our debt and deficit \u2014 and, frankly, improve Americans' impression of how we take care of their money \u2014 we need to sharpen our pencils and stop making the kind of expensive, avoidable mistakes that lead to wasteful spending and make our agencies and programs vulnerable to fraud and abuse,\" Sen. Tom Carper, (D-DE) said at the hearing.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Despite the Obama administration\u2019s attempts to curb the billions of improper payments", "title": "The Government\u2019s $125 Billion Slap in the Face to Taxpayers", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/18/Government-s-125-Billion-Slap-Face-Taxpayers", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/04192011_Taxes_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/18/Government-s-125-Billion-Slap-Face-Taxpayers", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/04192011_Taxes_article.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Despite the Obama administration\u2019s attempts to curb the billions of improper payments", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8ec8\"", "article_summary": "In 2013, about $97 billion of total improper payments were overpayments, while $9 billion were underpayments, according to data from paymentaccuracy.gov.\nHowever, just three programs \u2014 Medicare, Medicaid and the Earned Income Tax Credit \u2014 accounted for more than $80.9 billion of the total.\nDespite the Obama administration\u2019s attempts to curb the billions of improper payments federal agencies dole out each year, the problem is actually getting worse.\nTogether, Medicare and Medicaid paid out $77.4 billion in improper payments, a 20.4 percent increase over 2013.\nRelated: $74 Billion Food Stamp Program in Budget CrosshairsThe GAO\u2019s tally accounted for erroneous payments across 124 programs under 22 federal agencies."}
