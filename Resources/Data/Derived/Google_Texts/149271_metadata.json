The House voted along party lines to set the stage for an imminent shutdown of the federal government. Having failed to go to a conference committee to reconcile their budget with the Senate passed budget or approve most appropriations bills, the House voted for a stopgap funding resolution dependent on defunding the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Regrettably, all Wisconsin GOP reps. voted for extortion. All Wisconsin Democratic reps. voted against a suicide mission (the 42nd GOP attempt to repeal / sabotage the ACA). The Democratic-led Senate and President Obama will never sign off on this scheme! There's more.\n\n\n\nDelusional LA GOP Rep. John Fleming called the ACA \"the most existential threat to our economy since the Great Depression.\" Forget Wall Street, big banks, shady mortgage bonds and the housing bubble that collapsed the economy under President Bush. However, former OH GOP Rep. Steve LaTourette said: \"Thirty to 40 other (GOP) members of the House... believe their only responsibility as a member of Congress is to show up and vote no.....a trained monkey could do what they do....the monkeys are running the zoo\" (in fairness to LaTourette he was also critical of Democrats). However, GOP leaders are driving this car over the cliff. That's not all.\n\n\n\nEarlier, the GOP-led House voted for draconian cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), aka food stamps. Millions of deserving hungry citizens, unemployed by a still recovering economy, will be tossed overboard. Former GOP Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole and former Democratic Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle spoke out: \"In an unprecedented move, the House stripped...SNAP...from the (farm) bill with an intention to pass a separate nutrition bill, one with significant cuts to programs that fight hunger...\" Dole and Daschle pleaded with the GOP-led House not to let the \"bill fall victim to the misguided and detrimental partisan politics we face today, the results for families and children will be severe. In a country struggling to emerge from the worst economic recession since the Depression, this is no time to play politics with hunger\".\n\n\n\nSadly, all Wisconsin GOP reps. voted for this cruel bill while all Wisconsin Democratic reps. opposed it. Moreover, Wisconsin GOP Governor Scott Walker is also out of step with Sen. Dole. At Walker's urging, the GOP-led legislature approved a similarly draconian approach. Unemployed adults without children will be limited to just three months of SNAP over three years, unless they have jobs or are getting work training. But with unemployment over 10 percent in Milwaukee and 6.7 per cent overall in Wisconsin, many will not find work. Heartless!\n\n\n\nFinally, voters ought to be angry and fed up with the GOP-led House. If the nonsense with the stopgap resolution and defunding ACA as well as the mean-spirited SNAP bill doesn't arouse us, then the overall sorry record of the House should. Bills like immigration reform pass with bipartisan support in the Senate and go nowhere in the House. In fact, the House has done so little this year that it is on track to have the least productive session since 1947! Enough with extremism, heartlessness and stupidity. Memo to GOP: as millions of Americans finally get health care coverage they will not forget efforts to deny them that security.\n\n\n\n-- Kaplan wrote a guest column from Washington, D.C. for the Wisconsin State Journal from 1995 - 2009.", "article_metadata": {}, "article_summary": "Regrettably, all Wisconsin GOP reps. voted for extortion.\nSadly, all Wisconsin GOP reps. voted for this cruel bill while all Wisconsin Democratic reps. opposed it.\nThe House voted along party lines to set the stage for an imminent shutdown of the federal government.\nEarlier, the GOP-led House voted for draconian cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), aka food stamps.\nMoreover, Wisconsin GOP Governor Scott Walker is also out of step with Sen.
