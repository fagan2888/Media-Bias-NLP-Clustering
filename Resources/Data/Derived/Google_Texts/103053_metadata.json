Rather, Helsinki\u2019s plan is to provide its residents with a smartphone app that can knit together all the different transportation options in the city \u2014 subways, buses, taxis, ferries, car sharing services, bike sharing services, etc \u2014 into one complete trip from Point A to Point B. Users would input an origin and a destination, and the app would plot out their trip, along with which modes of transportation they\u2019d use, according to their preferences, their available time, the weather, and other variables. Payments could be structured in different ways \u2014 by the kilometer, by the trip, or as a monthly fee, for instance \u2014 but in every instance the user would be making one single payment via the app rather than paying for each mode of transport individually.\n\nEssentially, it would be a one-stop-shop marketplace for transportation \u2014 similar to what Obamacare is trying to achieve for health insurance with its exchanges.\n\nThe idea is called \u201cmobility on demand\u201d \u2014 planning out transportation across public, private, and shared systems, all as a service delivered to customers. And because the primary value of owning a car is the convenience of immediately available transportation \u2014 95 percent of the average car\u2019s life is spent sitting idle \u2014 proponents think Helsinki\u2019s system, if sufficiently successful and effective, could more or less eliminate the need for car ownership among the city\u2019s residents.\n\nIn 2012, Helsinki debuted a program that could serve as a prelude for mobility on demand, called \u201cKutsuplus.\u201d (Finnish for \u201ccall plus.\u201d) It\u2019s a system of minibuses, coordinated by computer, that can be called up by a smartphone app. Users can designate a start point, end point, and whether they\u2019d like to ride by themselves or not. The cost is a $4.75 user fee plus 60 cents per kilometer \u2014 more than a standard Helsinki bus fare, but less than a taxi ride. The system actually wasn\u2019t meant to end car use but to make it easier to get to public transportation, and was serving 4,500 people as of September 2013.\n\nKutsuplus was also cited by Sonja Heikkil\u00e4, a 24-year-old Helsinki transportation engineer whose master\u2019s thesis laid the blueprint for mobility on demand. And while Helsinki\u2019s current plan appears to be rolling out mobility on demand as a public utility, Heikkil\u00e4 ultimately envisions the service is an actual marketplace: multiple apps created by different private companies, all competing for who can do the best job of packaging and planning transportation for customers. To that end, her master\u2019s thesis recommends that the city government not only provide the service itself, but also compile and make public the data that other firms could use to create their own version of the app. Legislation and regulation would also need to be altered to facilitate the new service, and frameworks set up to encourage cooperation among stakeholders.\n\nFrom a climate change perspective, Helsinki\u2019s mobility on demand plan represents the kind of innovation that will be necessary to cut carbon emissions. There\u2019s no inherent reason all the people living in dense urban areas should need to own a car. By facilitating this kind of service use and transportation sharing, the plan would allow a far smaller fleet of cars to serve that same population. That would mean less resource use, less space taken up by the need for parking, and most importantly it would require burning far fewer fossil fuels.\n\nPeople usually think of technology when discussing innovation, which may be why some critics argue against aggressive policies to curb carbon emissions, and favor efforts to simply ramp up research and development of new energy technologies instead. But innovation can extend far beyond more advanced solar panels or better smart meters, and into changes in policy, social organization, and business models. Those are the sorts of adaptations that become more likely if we put a comprehensive price on greenhouse gas emissions (in this case, one that includes the transportation sector) precisely because they involve decentralized experimentation across a society. Creating the kind of all-purpose price signal to drive that activity is exactly what something like a carbon tax or a cap-and-trade system could do.\n\nSome unanswered questions remain, however. The Guardian pointed to whether the system would serve the less-dense municipalities around Helsinki as well as it would serve the city center, and to the issue of how accessible the mobility on demand plan would be to lower-income customers. In America, for example, access to the internet and to smartphones often breaks down along class lines: households that earn less than $30,000 per year are 35 percent less likely to have Internet access than households earning $75,000 or more. And similar divides show up along race and geographic lines as well.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "The plan would give residents a smartphone app that knits together all the different transportation options in the city into one complete trip.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "The plan would give residents a smartphone app that knits together all the different transportation options in the city into one complete trip.", "title": "In This City, Car Ownership Could Soon Be A Thing Of The Past", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2014/08/05/3467538/helsinki-car-mobility/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/shutterstock_136701113-e1407189612668.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/shutterstock_136701113-e1407189612668-320x213.jpg", "title": "In This City, Car Ownership Could Soon Be A Thing Of The Past", "description": "The plan would give residents a smartphone app that knits together all the different transportation options in the city into one complete trip.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@ThinkProgress"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-climate", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/shutterstock_136701113-e1407189612668.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/shutterstock_136701113-e1407189612668.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-05T09:14:59+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1941\"", "article_summary": "Climate In This City, Car Ownership Could Soon Be A Thing Of The Past CREDIT: ShutterstockHelsinki, the capital of Finland, has a a plan that might make car ownership a thing of the past.\nFrom a climate change perspective, Helsinki\u2019s mobility on demand plan represents the kind of innovation that will be necessary to cut carbon emissions.\nThere\u2019s no inherent reason all the people living in dense urban areas should need to own a car.\nThe idea is called \u201cmobility on demand\u201d \u2014 planning out transportation across public, private, and shared systems, all as a service delivered to customers.\nKutsuplus was also cited by Sonja Heikkil\u00e4, a 24-year-old Helsinki transportation engineer whose master\u2019s thesis laid the blueprint for mobility on demand."}
