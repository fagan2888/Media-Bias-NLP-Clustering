They say that the activities that federal regulators are controlling will not significantly protect the bat from white-nose syndrome.\n\n\u201cThis decision flouts transparency and will fail to mitigate the real menace to this species, which is a disease called white nose syndrome \u2014 not human activities,\u201d Rep. Rob Bishop Rob BishopNational ocean policy threatens new regulatory burdens House panel approves Puerto Rico debt relief Menendez opposing Puerto Rico debt bill MORE (R-Utah), chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the administration and extremist environmental groups want us all to pat them on the back for labeling this species \u2018threatened,\u2019 which is a distraction from addressing WNS [white-nose syndrome], the real threat to the bat,\u201d he said.\n\nSenators have also objected to the listing. In a February hearing, Sen. Rob Portman Rob PortmanJuan Williams: Electoral map looks grim for Trump McConnell touts 'Senate squad' in Wes Anderson-style video Liberal super-PAC hits Johnson for supporting Trump MORE (R-Ohio) told Interior Secretary Sally Jewell that a listing would not save the bat.\n\n\u201cWhite-nose syndrome is the issue ... it's not development or commercial activity,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2014 This story was updated on April 2 at 11:04 a.m.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Federal officials have declared the northern long-eared bat a threatened species, defying objections from congressional Republicans.", "description": "Federal officials have declared the northern long-eared bat a threatened species, defying objections from congressional Republicans.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Timothy Cama", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Federal officials have declared the northern long-eared bat a threatened species, defying objections from congressional Republicans.", "title": "Feds declare bat species \u2018threatened\u2019 despite GOP objections", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/237625-feds-declare-bat-species-threatened-despite-gop-objections", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/bats03052015getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-04-02T11:29:03-04:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2015-04-02T11:29-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/237625-feds-declare-bat-species-threatened-despite-gop-objections", "dcterms.date": "2015-04-01T14:19-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Timothy Cama", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Endangered Species Act, northern long-eared bat,Dan Ashe, Rob Bishop, Rob Portman,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-01T14:19:10-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-02T11:29:03-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/237625-feds-declare-bat-species-threatened-despite-gop-objections", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Federal officials have declared the northern long-eared bat a threatened species, defying objections from congressional Republicans.", "card": "summary", "title": "Feds declare bat species \u2018threatened\u2019 despite GOP objections"}, "dcterms.title": "Feds declare bat species \u2018threatened\u2019 despite GOP objections"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd54a9\"", "article_summary": "Federal officials have declared the northern long-eared bat a threatened species, defying objections from congressional Republicans.\nThe Fish and Wildlife Service\u2019s listing under the Endangered Species Act means the bat is under threat of becoming endangered.\nThey say that the activities that federal regulators are controlling will not significantly protect the bat from white-nose syndrome.\n\u201cWhite-nose syndrome is the issue ... it's not development or commercial activity,\u201d he said.\nIts populations have dwindled in recent years largely due to fungal white-nose syndrome."}
