Thankfully, our Republican state leaders have a ready answer: That unfortunate and periodic crash in energy prices is once again ravaging our state. Nevermind why they were unprepared for massive and historic budget cuts.\n\nOne has to wonder, having been under supermajority control for several years of the most radical elements of the Teapublican party (in which Oklahoma\u2019s hyper-conservative Tea Party and Republicans merged) and having $100-a-barrel oil revenue flowing in, how is it, no matter the cause, that this group of fiscal conservatives managed to drive us off the cliff so catastrophically?\n\nNorth Dakota, with a tiny budget, took advantage of their oil-revenue bonanza and built a $2 billion-dollar rainy day fund. The Oklahoma Rainy Day fund balance for a much larger budget is now about $300 million and soon could be zero.\n\nEducation and health care are where the catastrophe is currently most visible. One by one, schools are now announcing four-day weeks rather than five. Many programs are being eliminated, with band, track, arts or other programs that are apparently optional in Oklahoma being cancelled daily. Now, the Legislature is half-way to passing a radical cut in Medicaid whereby 111,000 Oklahomans below the $9,500 annual earnings level and with a dependent in the household will be thrown off this essential lifeline of health care.\n\nOne-hundred eleven-thousand Oklahomans with kids!\n\nMore draconian is the discussion of becoming the first state in the nation to eliminate Medicaid, thereby stopping health care to 800,000 adults and more than 500,000 children while losing billions in federal funds.\n\n\u2018Just not much our conservative leaders can do\u2019\n\nWhen I am keeping my grandkids and some small misfortune occurs, I have trained them to say to their mothers, \u201cIt was not Papaw\u2019s fault.\u201d\n\nThe governor and the Legislature have made it clear this is not their fault. Even our media have bought into the idea that Oklahoma\u2019s budget crisis is due only to the drop in oil and gas prices, and there is just not much our conservative leaders can do.\n\nMeanwhile, it is comforting to all of us to see the Legislature busy itself by doing what it does best: spending scads of time processing anti-gay bills, undoubtedly unconstitutional abortion bills and an effort to change the state Constitution to allow the Ten Commandments monument back on the Capitol grounds.\n\nIf we accept the notion etched into the National Archives Building that, \u201cthe Past is Prologue,\u201d then let\u2019s avert our eyes from the car wreck and spend a moment understanding how we got here. You will need pencil, paper and a small calculator.\n\nElections have consequences\n\nThe amount of the shortfall for FY 2017 has been \u201ccertified\u201d by the people who do such things as being $1.28 billion. This is an 18 percent shortfall from last year\u2019s certified appropriation level.\n\nBut it gets \u201cbetter.\u201d When revenue is disappearing faster than excuses are being made, bureaucrats call that an \u201cemergency failure of revenue,\u201d and we have had two of those so far in what is known as the FY 2016 budget (from July 1, 2015, to June 30, 2016).\n\nOur state leaders advised the agencies to cut 3 percent in December and another 4 percent in March. Because these cuts are made to agency budgets after the agencies have already spent part of the budget, the effective size of the cut was 18 percent in the funds remaining for the balance of this budget year.\n\nThis will be \u201cgood practice\u201d for cutting another 18 percent out of the budgets starting on July 1 as required by the \u201ccertification\u201d of what is available for FY 2017 (July 1 to June 30, 2017). Perhaps even worse, smart people at the Oklahoma Policy Institute are forecasting budget cuts for the following year (FY 2018 \u2014 July 1, 2017, to June 30, 2018) of potentially another billion dollars, which would be 14 percent of the original 2016 budget.\n\nSo, let\u2019s add this up: 7 percent this year in emergency reductions, 18 percent in the next year and 14 percent in the following year. This sounds like a 39 percent cut in state appropriations, but the 7 percent is included in the 18 percent shortfall, so it is actually \u201conly\u201d 32 percent.\n\nSo, for those like Grover Norquist who want to shrink government down to a size where one can \u201cdrown it in a bathtub,\u201d Oklahoma\u2019s budget situation should be eliciting nothing but high fives.\n\nFor the rest of us horrified at the tragic collapse of education, health care and public safety that is upon us, it is time to speak up and do more to somehow wake voters from their slumber.\n\nDecline hinges on tax cuts, not oil\n\nIf you break next year\u2019s shortfall into its major components, the $1.28 billion deficit boils down to a shortfall in gross production taxes (oil and gas taxes), individual income tax, sales tax and one-time funds.\n\nAnatomy of the shortfall\n\n(in millions) Gross production decline: $224.3 Individual income-tax cut impact: $147.0 Individual income tax decline: $177.4 Sales tax decline: $229.1 All other sources: $10.2 Rainy Day funds $150.0 Other one -time funds: $350.0 TOTAL SHORTFALL: $1,288.0\n\nThe decline in gross production tax clearly can be blamed on the current oil bust, right?\n\nWrong. Yes, the prices have declined to result in a $224 million shortfall from that funding source, but guess which band of geniuses voted to cut the rate of the gross production tax in 2010, which today shorts the state budget by about $300 million?\n\nSo, the overall decline in the gross production tax over time has been more due to boneheaded reductions in tax rates than another oil bust. I find it amazing that an industry that is 13.2 percent of our economy only accounts for 2 to 3 percent of the state\u2019s budget revenue. North Dakota has a 10 percent production tax (compared to Oklahoma\u2019s 2 percent tax) with one-third of that revenue put aside for its rainy day fund.\n\nSo let\u2019s give the Teapublican party its excuse on the $224 million shortfall as being the fault of declines in oil and gas prices, but let\u2019s not forget they had already reduced this funding source to a ridiculous and historically low level. That impact remains far larger than this year\u2019s oil-bust-related revenue loss.\n\nTax breaks benefit the rich and GOP incumbents\n\nThose that argue the entire shortfall is due to an oil bust have to believe that the $324.4 million shortfall in individual income tax collections is all due to the loss of income and jobs in the oil and gas business. The biggest fiction of this theory is that $147 million of this shortfall is due to the current Legislature\u2019s unfathomable cut in the income tax this year from 5.25 percent to 5 percent. Eighty percent of Oklahoma households save an average of $29.50 per year. Of course, the top 20 percent save $298.25, and the top 1 percent save more than $2,000 per household \u2014 because they really need it more, obviously!\n\nLet\u2019s just admit, shall we, that 45 percent of the loss in individual income tax revenue this coming fiscal year, FY 2017, is due entirely to the ideological requirement to survive the next Republican primary election by being FOR (!) tax cuts, no matter how unnecessary and no matter the consequences.\n\n(By the way, the loss in individual income tax collections as a result of this completely unnecessary cut is expected to balloon to nearly $200 million in FY 2018 and over a quarter of a billion dollars the following year.)\n\nThe balance of the $324.4 million in individual income tax shortfall is $177 million (8.5 percent of total individual income tax collections) and is obviously due to less income to tax \u2014 but is it all due to a loss of oil-related income?\n\nA stroll through a recent economic-indicator report on Oklahoma clearly show that \u201cmining\u201d (the odd term applied to oil and gas extraction) constitutes 12.5 percent of the state\u2019s economic activity and is responsible for about 5 percent of private-sector jobs and 13.5 percent of overall earnings statewide.\n\nCan a decline in only 5 percent of our total jobs truly account for all of the 8.5 percent decline in the individual income tax collections? Not unless ALL oil and gas jobs in the state were eliminated and then some.\n\nPartisan ideology: a wholesale assault\n\nSo what accounts for this significant decline in incomes? Consider the wholesale assault that has been going on for years against government services, education and health care, and ask yourself whether or not this assault by the Teapublicans is beginning to take its toll.\n\nIn December, employment statistics actually reveal a small increase in oil and gas employment but significant losses in government, education and health care. By comparison, government comprises 15.5 percent of our economy while education and health care account for a combined 7.5 percent \u2014 much larger than the 12.5 percent attributable to oil and gas.\n\nSo, as our state leaders stubbornly hold out, refusing to accept billions of dollars in health care funds through the Affordable Care Act\u2019s Medicaid expansion, do we really think this leaves our economy unaffected?\n\nEven after a Republican former governor came to town and prepared a report (the Leavitt Report) showing that the state would benefit by hundreds of millions of dollars from the Medicaid expansion, it was still rejected for purely partisan reasons. As a result, health care is denied funding, and massive cuts have and will continue to be made with several rural hospitals either closing or beginning the process of closing.\n\nIn the face of this assault on education, government services and health care, can we really say that the entirety of the individual income tax shortfall is due oil prices dropping?\n\nOf course not.\n\nMy own view is that about 40 percent of this shortfall is oil-and gas-related, and the rest is due to the continuing assault on government services, education and health care (totaling 23 percent of the Oklahoma economy) by Teapublican leaders who control the Legislature and the executive branch.\n\nWhen 111,000 households with children face potential denial of health care to save $100 million, when recent headlines trumpet that Oklahoma is considering being the first state in the nation to eliminate the entire Medicaid program, do we really fail to realize the dramatic and adverse effects those actions will have on individual income- and sales-tax collections?\n\nThis brand of partisan ideology is taking a terrible toll on our state.\n\nAt most, half of the shortfall can be blamed on an oil bust\n\nWithout belaboring the argument further, the sales tax collections shortfall succumbs to the same proportionate share of the economy reasoning I\u2019ve offered above for individual income taxes. The \u201cother\u201d revenue shortfall is small, so for the sake of argument, let\u2019s apply the same \u201c40-percent-of-the-problem\u201d estimate as it relates to oil-and-gas declines.\n\nHere are the results of these assumptions. We accept the Teapublican leaders\u2019 excuse that 100 percent of the gross-production-tax shortfall is all due to an oil and gas rate decline, although one has to turn a blind eye to their doubling the oil and gas give away in 2010. Then, we can partially accept their \u201cnot my fault\u201d mantra by allowing them to credit oil-and-gas declines with 40 percent of the income tax, sales tax and other revenue fall off, even though it stretches credulity to think a partial jobs decline in 13.2 percent of our economy is creating an 8.5 percent drop in the whole state\u2019s income. Seventy-five percent of all oil and gas jobs would have to have been eliminated to achieve such a number, and actual job losses in the mining sector to date are minimal. The one-time fund numbers have nothing to do with oil and gas price declines and everything to do with careless, short-term budgeting.\n\nUsing the 100 percent assumption on gross production taxes and a 40 percent estimate on other taxes depending on economic activity produces a conclusion that 30.4 percent of the budget shortfall is due to an oil and gas rate decline and that 70 percent is due to stupid, ideological, uncaring, boneheaded decision making by people concerned more about their re-election than Oklahoma\u2019s interests. The 40 percent estimate is too low, you say? Then give the Teapublicans full license to use their excuse that it is all due to an oil bust, and still only 50 percent of the shortfall can be attributed to an \u201coil bust.\u201d\n\nDigging a hole with asinine decisions\n\nAs mentioned above, \u201celections have consequences.\u201d In Oklahoma\u2019s case, elections of ideologues rather than problem solvers have resulted in the implosion of the most basic and most important functions of government \u2014 educating our children and caring for those who cannot afford to care for themselves.\n\nWe have elected a band of nearly crazed, right-wing, poorly informed and apparently uncaring \u201cleaders\u201d who \u2014 under one-party rule \u2014 have no electoral downside to enacting policies that sound great in hyper-conservative town halls but are creating a hole out of which it will take decades to climb.\n\nNot since the gubernatorial terms of Alfalfa Bill Murray have our decisions been so asinine \u2014 his born out of hatred for FDR, ours now born out of a hatred for Barack Obama.\n\nMay God grant our voters more wisdom in the next election.\n\nNumbers crunched for the sake of argument\n\nImpact Due to Oil and Gas Rate Decline (w/ 40% assumption) (in millions) (w/ 100% assumption) (in millions) Gross Production Decline 100.0% $224.31 100.0% $224.31 Individual Income Tax Rate Cut Impact 0.0% $0.00 0.0% $0.00 Portion of Individual Income Tax Decline 40.0% $70.96 100.0% $177.41 Sales Tax Decline 40.0% $91.63 100.0% $229.07 Other Sources 40.0% $4.08 100.0% $10.20 Rainy Day Funds 0.0% $0.00 0.0% $0.00 Other One Time Funds 0.0% $0.00 0.0% $0.00 Total Budget Shortfall Due to Oil Decline $391.0 $641.0 % of Total Shortfall Due to Oil Price Decline 30.4% 49.8%\n\n(Editor\u2019s note: This post was updated to clarify a subhead and adjust minor grammatical phrasings.)", "article_metadata": {"description": "Former Gov.
