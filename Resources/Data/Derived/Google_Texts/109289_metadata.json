Davis researchers tracked pesticide applications on farms in the Central Valley, near Sacramento, and the Bay Area and matched that data to the addresses of women who lived nearby when they were pregnant.\n\nThe fetus tends to be vulnerable to certain kinds of insults,\u201d said Irva Hertz-Picciotto, an environmental epidemiologist at the MIND Institute at U.C. Davis and lead author of the study. \u201cPesticides may be one of those sets of chemicals that we need to be particularly careful about.\n\nThe study was published Monday in Environmental Health Perspectives.\n\nStudies linking autism with pesticide use are new and not wholly accepted within scientific circles. Clare Thorp is a scientist with Crop Life America, a trade association for pesticide producers. She says this kind of geographic-based research is limited. Just because women lived near fields where pesticides were used doesn\u2019t mean they were actually exposed to the compounds.\n\n\u201cPeople who are at these addresses, they\u2019re not always going to be standing out in their garden. They\u2019re going to be inside the house or they might be at work, or they could be in the grocery store,\u201d Thorp said.\n\nShe says the study never verified if pesticides entered women\u2019s bodies by testing their skin or blood.\n\nHealthDay reports that the authors of the study agree that this research represents only a small piece of the autism puzzle:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Still, the study does not show that pesticide exposure causes autism.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Study Finds Pesticide Exposure in Pregnancy Linked to Autism\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2014\\/06\\/23\\/study-finds-pesticide-exposure-in-pregnancy-linked-to-autism\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-06-23 13:47:14\",\"mod_date\":\"2014-06-24 09:49:56\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":19679,\"author_id\":\"3205\",\"author_name\":\"April Dembosky\",\"author_display_name\":\"April Dembosky\",\"tags\":[\"Pesticides\",\"Science\"],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\",\"Living Healthy\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2014\\/06\\/3995559405_69050cfcc4_b.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "Still, the study does not show that pesticide exposure causes autism.", "title": "Study Finds Pesticide Exposure in Pregnancy Linked to Autism", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2014/06/23/study-finds-pesticide-exposure-in-pregnancy-linked-to-autism/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2014/06/3995559405_69050cfcc4_b-640x428.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "pesticides,science", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2711\"", "article_summary": "Just because women lived near fields where pesticides were used doesn\u2019t mean they were actually exposed to the compounds.\nHealthDay reports that the authors of the study agree that this research represents only a small piece of the autism puzzle:\nStudies linking autism with pesticide use are new and not wholly accepted within scientific circles.\nShe says the study never verified if pesticides entered women\u2019s bodies by testing their skin or blood.\nPregnant women living within a mile of fields where pesticides were applied faced almost double the risk of having a baby who developed autism \u2014 compared to women who lived more than a mile away, a new study finds."}
