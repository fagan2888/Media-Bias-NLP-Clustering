John Kasich to suspend his presidential campaign \u2014 don\u2019t.\n\nMany observers have remarked on Kasich\u2019s lack of organization, lack of funding, single-digit poll numbers, and thinly-veiled hatred of Republican primary voters as reasons he should maybe stop pursuing the Republican nomination for president.\n\nNone of these things matter to Kasich. The only thing that does is Ohio\u2019s March 15 primary.\n\nKasich\u2019s single-state campaign in New Hampshire got a lower percentage of votes than Jon Huntsman won before dropping out in 2012, but his 2nd-place finish was enough to spin as the early \u201cwin\u201d Kasich needed to continue.\n\nSure, Kasich finished 8th of 10 in Iowa, 5th of 6 in South Carolina, and 5th of 5 in Nevada. Those states aren\u2019t Ohio, which is \u2014 I\u2019ve just been handed this breaking news \u2014 the state where John Kasich is governor.\n\nOhio is also the state hosting the RNC convention, a convention Kasich\u2019s right-hand man is leaving the governor\u2019s office to help the Ohio Republican Party run:\n\n[Jai] Chabria and others stressed that he remains a key member of Kasich\u2019s inner circle. The move, Chabria said, will free him up to be more helpful to the governor\u2019s run. \u201cI\u2019m a Kasich partisan. I have been my entire life,\u201d said Chabria, whose last day on the state payroll is Friday. \u201cI will make sure anything I do advances his career. \u2026 I\u2019m going to use the ability to be on the outside to further enhance John Kasich and his brand.\u201d\n\nMatt Borges, ORP chairman, couldn\u2019t be more delighted:\n\n\u201cTo have the governor\u2019s top lieutenant navigating all of those issues is huge,\u201d Borges said. \u201cThe governor won\u2019t be able to spend much time on this. Jai is the next best thing.\u201d\n\nThe same goes for Kasich campaign guru John Weaver:\n\n\u201cSomeone has to look at the convention through John Kasich\u2019s eyes, and there is no one better to do that than Jai,\u201d Weaver said. \u201cHe has been and is a central part of the governor\u2019s political and governmental life. To have him at the state party where he can more easily assist everyone is a boon for the Kasich campaign.\u201d\n\nSo\u2026 yeah. Team Kasich is still moving pieces into place for the convention. Expect ORP to expend vast resources for Kasich in Ohio, and don\u2019t count on Kasich bowing out any earlier than March 16.\n\nKasich acolytes control ORP because of a concerted effort to drive out nonbelievers from the state central committee in 2012. Useful idiots like yours truly played along, expecting a unified ORP to pave the way for Kasich\u2019s conservative agenda and help the 2012 Republican presidential nominee.\n\nSo much for that. While Mitt Romney tried to campaign against the Obama economy, Kasich trumpeted Ohio\u2019s amazing rebound in preparation for his 2014 reelection campaign and the current presidential race.\n\nAnd how about Kasich\u2019s conservative agenda?\n\nIt\u2019s true that Kasich has cut taxes, expanded school choice, and signed numerous solid pro-life and pro-Second Amendment bills sent to his desk by the Republican supermajorities in the Ohio House and Ohio Senate.\n\nA great many parts of the governor\u2019s record, though, are the opposite of what conservatives had in mind when many of us were suckered into helping him take over ORP.\n\nSince 2012, Kasich has been fighting for a huge fracking tax hike, a policy he promotes as a way to fund an income tax cut by sticking it to Big Oil. He has torpedoed Republican efforts to make Ohio a right-to-work state and roll back \u201cgreen energy\u201d mandates.\n\nWhen Kasich came into office in 2011, Ohio\u2019s General Revenue Fund spending was $26.2 billion. By 2015, Kasich had increased GRF spending to $30.8 billion.\n\nThen there\u2019s Obamacare expansion, a policy so awful it should be disqualifying on the merits alone. Kasich\u2019s method of expanding Obamacare and his preachy promotion of Obamacare expansion could hardly be worse.\n\nBut Team Kasich runs ORP, so Kasich\u2019s embrace of Obamacare didn\u2019t stop the Party from spending big to run up the score in 2014 against a hapless, scandal-plagued Democrat who quit campaigning in August.\n\nBeing entrusted with hosting the GOP convention didn\u2019t stop ORP from endorsing Kasich for president, either, and Kasich backers\u2019 control of ORP is why the General Assembly moved Ohio\u2019s primary to make it winner-take-all.\n\nTeam Kasich has been crafting their Ohio Miracle narrative for years, and they think it\u2019ll bring them a presidential nomination. If it takes a brokered convention, so be it.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Doomed, but not done", "title": "Kasich\u2019s kamikaze campaign zeroes in on Ohio", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2016/02/26/kasichs-kamikaze-campaign-zeroes-in-on-ohio/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@hotairblog"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-26T20:21:41+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-26T18:07:31+00:00"}, "keywords": "2016, 2016 convention, John Kasich, kasich,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "article_summary": "Kasich\u2019s kamikaze campaign zeroes in on Ohioposted at 3:21 pm on February 26, 2016 by Jason HartIf you\u2019re hoping another poor debate showing prompts Ohio Gov.\nThose states aren\u2019t Ohio, which is \u2014 I\u2019ve just been handed this breaking news \u2014 the state where John Kasich is governor.\nJohn Kasich to suspend his presidential campaign \u2014 don\u2019t.\nOhio is also the state hosting the RNC convention, a convention Kasich\u2019s right-hand man is leaving the governor\u2019s office to help the Ohio Republican Party run:[Jai] Chabria and others stressed that he remains a key member of Kasich\u2019s inner circle.\nExpect ORP to expend vast resources for Kasich in Ohio, and don\u2019t count on Kasich bowing out any earlier than March 16."}
