Other than the standard somber and polite statement from the White House, the president did not address the court, now split between red and blue 4-4.\n\nThe president at 7:30 a.m. was driven from Larry Ellison\u2019s Porcupine Creek Country Club to the nearby Thunderbird Country Club, where he worked out on gym equipment for nearly two hours.\n\nThen came more golf with Honolulu boyhood friends and frequent golf partners \u2014 Greg Orme, Mike Ramos and Bobby Titcomb \u2014 back at Ellison\u2019s private, 19-hole course at his 249-acre Rancho Mirage estate.\n\nThe four men had also played Friday and Saturday at the Stadium Course at PGA West in La Quinta, which recently hosted the CareerBuilder Challenge.\n\nIt was sunny and 79 degrees at tee time.\n\nOn Monday comes a two-day summit of Asian leaders at Sunnylands resort.\n\nAir Force One landed just after 11:30 a.m. Friday at Palm Springs International Airport, after being diverted briefly to fly over mountainous terrain that the president newly designated as national monuments.\n\nOn hand to meet Obama were Palm Springs Mayor Robert Moon and Rancho Mirage Mayor Dana Hobart.\n\nThe motorcade left the airport and encountered crowds of onlookers. At least one person held up a sign that read \u201cthe ACA is not Affordable,\u201d a reference to the Affordable Care Act, also known as \u201cObamacare.\u201d\n\nThe motorcade took Obama to Porcupine Creek Golf Club in Rancho Mirage, a property owned by Oracle CEO Larry Ellison.\n\nObama will be joined by Secretary of State John Kerry at Sunnylands for the gathering on Monday and Tuesday of leaders from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. The summit is aimed at strengthening the new U.S.- ASEAN strategic partnership, forged last November during a presidential trip to Malaysia.\n\n\u201cThis unprecedented gathering \u2014 the first hosted by the United States with the ASEAN leaders \u2014 builds on the deeper partnership that the United States has forged with ASEAN since 2009 and will further advance the Administration\u2019s rebalance to Asia and the Pacific,\u201d according to a White House statement.\n\nRoad closures scheduled through 4 p.m. Tuesday include:\n\n\u2014 Kirk Douglas Way, between Ramon and El Cielo roads,\n\n\u2014 Airport Center Drive at Kirk Douglas Way.\n\nThe public can access Palm Springs International Airport via the main entrance at the intersection of Tahquitz Canyon Way and El Cielo Road.\n\nOther road closures went into effect today at 10 a.m. surrounding the Sunnylands Estate and were scheduled through 3 p.m. Tuesday.\n\nThese include:\n\n\u2013Gerald Ford Drive at Bob Hope Drive,\n\n\u2013Bob Hope Drive at Frank Sinatra Drive,\n\n\u2013Frank Sinatra Drive from Morningside Drive to Bob Hope Drive.", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Barack Obama continues his trip through Southern California--check road closures.
