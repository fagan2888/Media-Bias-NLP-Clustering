Most insurance-industry analysts are wondering how companies involved in the exchanges will be able to avoid double-digit increases in premiums.\n\nThis summer, the insurance companies will be asking state regulators for massive premium increases. It is probable that the insurance commissions will not give the industry the full increases they believe they need to become profitable. At that point, several insurers will be forced to make a decision whether to remain on the exchanges or pull out altogether.\n\nPolitico:\n\n\u201cI think a lot of insurance carriers expected red ink, but they didn\u2019t expect this much red ink,\u201d said Greg Scott, who oversees Deloitte\u2019s health plans practice. \"... A number of carriers need double-digit increases.\u201d In some ways, the turmoil is not surprising: Under the health law, plans are unable to choose who to insure, or how much to charge them based on their medical history. As a result, many plans enrolled a larger proportion of sicker people than they bargained for. But some of those losses were also a function of political wrangling after Republican lawmakers blocked payments that were supposed to help insurers get through the difficult first years. The timing, though, is bad news for Democrats. Proposed rate hikes are just starting to dribble out, setting up a battle over health insurance costs in a tumultuous presidential election year that will decide the fate of Obamacare. And the headlines are likely to keep coming right up to Election Day since many consumers won\u2019t see actual rates until the insurance marketplaces open Nov. 1 \u2014 a week before they go to the polls. \u201cAny reports of premium increases will immediately become talking points on the campaign trail,\u201d said Larry Levitt, senior vice president for special initiatives at the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation. \u201cWe\u2019re in an election where the very future of the law will be debated.\u201d\n\nAt bottom, the reason companies are losing money is that not enough healthy young people are signing up:\n\nOne big reason is lower-than-expected enrollment of younger, often healthier people who balance the costs of those who require more costly care. Roughly 12.7 million Americans signed up for Obamacare plans during the most recent open enrollment period. That\u2019s far below the 22 million projected by the Congressional Budget Office, and it\u2019s certain to decline as some drop out. \u201cThe pool is far less healthy than we forecast,\u201d said Brad Wilson, CEO of Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina, which says it lost $400 million on its exchange business during the first two years and is weighing whether to compete for Obamacare customers in 2017. \u201cThat\u2019s an issue not just here in North Carolina, but all over. \u2026 We need more healthy people in the pool.\u201d There\u2019s a growing realization the financial penalty for failing to obtain coverage is an insufficient cudgel to convince younger Americans to enroll. The fee for 2016 is $695, or 2.5 percent of income, whichever is higher. Just 28 percent of HealthCare.gov customers for 2016 were between the ages of 18 and 34, significantly below the 35 percent threshold typically considered necessary for a balanced marketplace. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t enough of a hammer,\u201d said Kevin Fitzgerald, an insurance lawyer with Foley & Lardner. \u201cYou need a lot of healthy people to sign up to make the numbers work. Obviously that didn\u2019t happen.\n\n\"Hammers,\" \"cudgels,\" massive rate increases -- does this sound like Obamacare is thriving to you?", "article_metadata": {"page-title": "Obamacare: The gift that keeps on giving to Republicans", "title": "Obamacare: The gift that keeps on giving to Republicans", "og": {"site_name": "Trending", "description": "Insurance companies are losing billions as young, healthy people avoid the exchanges.", "title": "Obamacare Rate Increases Likely to be an Election Issue in November", "url": "https://pjmedia.com/trending/2016/05/02/obamacare-rate-increases-likely-to-be-an-election-issue-in-november/", "image": "http://pjmedia.com/trending/user-content/51/files/2016/05/shutterstock_233603383.sized-770x415xt.jpg", "updated_time": 1464343698, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Insurance companies are losing billions as young, healthy people avoid the exchanges.", "title": "Obamacare Rate Increases Likely to be an Election Issue in November", "url": "https://pjmedia.com/trending/2016/05/02/obamacare-rate-increases-likely-to-be-an-election-issue-in-november/", "image": "http://pjmedia.com/trending/user-content/51/files/2016/05/shutterstock_233603383.sized-770x415xt.jpg", "site": "@PJMedia_com", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "pinterest": "nopin", "pinterestDescription": "Obamacare Rate Increases Likely to be an Election Issue in November", "fb": {"app_id": 149848758413844}, "keywords": "Obamacare, risk corridors, individual mandate", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Obamacare Rate Increases Likely to Be an Election Issue in NovemberJust in time for the election, the Obamacare open-enrollment period gets underway on November 1.\n\"Hammers,\" \"cudgels,\" massive rate increases -- does this sound like Obamacare is thriving to you?\nRoughly 12.7 million Americans signed up for Obamacare plans during the most recent open enrollment period.\nProposed rate hikes are just starting to dribble out, setting up a battle over health insurance costs in a tumultuous presidential election year that will decide the fate of Obamacare.\nIt is probable that the insurance commissions will not give the industry the full increases they believe they need to become profitable."}
