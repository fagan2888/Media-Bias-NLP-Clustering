Ten drawings and not a Powerball jackpot winner in sight. Will this be the one that breaks the bank?

Time to check your tickets to see if the lengthy losing streak stretches longer or finally snaps. Here are the winning Powerball numbers drawn at 11 p.m. on Saturday, Sept. 14: 1-17-25-37-44, and the Powerball selected was 20.

Heading into tonight's drawing, the jackpot was estimated at $317 million and the projected cash option value was $176.3 million.

During the last drawing, Wednesday night, no tickets matched all the winning numbers (11-19-33-42-52, with the Powerball 33).

The last huge jackpot that was claimed was the $448.4 million Powerball drawing back on Aug. 7, which generated three winning tickets — two of which were sold in New Jersey. The so-called Ocean's 16, a group of 16 employees at the Ocean County maintenance garage, and Mario Scarnici of South Brunswick shared the Aug. 7 prize with Paul White of Minnesota.

It was the fourth largest jackpot in U.S. lottery history.

Since then, there have been two $1 million tickets sold in the state — one in Bloomfield for the Aug. 31 Powerball drawing and one in Passaic for the Sept. 6 Mega Millions drawing.

ARE YOU A WINNER?

Even if you didn't match all six winning numbers tonight, don't toss your tickets yet. You may have won a consolation prize.

Here's what the different Powerball outcomes are worth:

• 5 regular numbers, but not the Powerball number: $1 million prize

• 4 regular numbers, plus the Powerball number: $10,000 prize

• 4 regular numbers, but not the Powerball number: $100 prize

• 3 regular numbers, plus the Powerball number: $100 prize

• 3 regular numbers, but not the Powerball number: $7 prize

• 2 regular numbers, plus the Powerball number: $7 prize

• 1 regular number, plus the Powerball number: $4 prize

• The Powerball number, but no regular numbers: $4 prize
