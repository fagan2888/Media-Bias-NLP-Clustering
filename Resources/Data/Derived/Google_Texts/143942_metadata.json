Members of both parties attended the bill-signing ceremony, although Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky did not, with Congress on its Independence Day recess.\n\nThe trade-promotion authority measure is arguably the biggest legislative victory of the president\u2019s second term, and will help Mr. Obama conclude negotiations with Japan and 10 other countries on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the centerpiece of his economic agenda. The House and Senate approved both measures last week after House Democrats, including Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California, temporarily derailed the package.\n\nProgressives fought TPA bitterly, arguing that free trade agreements have led to the loss of good-paying jobs in the U.S.\n\nThe president said trade-promotion authority isn\u2019t \u201cthe end of the road\u201d for his efforts, noting that negotiations for the massive TPP are still unfinished. Trading partners have been waiting to see whether Congress granted Mr. Obama the authority to negotiate an agreement that won\u2019t be subject to amendments later.\n\n\u201cWe still have some tough negotiations that are going to be taking place,\u201d Mr. Obama said.\n\nMr. Boehner, who was leading a congressional delegation in Lithuania, said in a statement that TPA \u201cwill strengthen the hand of U.S. negotiators, allowing them to secure the best deal for American workers while maintaining new, rigorous standards of transparency and accountability.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis bill is a big win for American jobs and leadership, and I hope the president will continue to work with us to get more bipartisan, House-passed jobs bills signed into law,\u201d Mr. Boehner said.\n\nMr. McConnell, speaking at a Sons of the American Revolution conference in Louisville, said the U.S. will benefit from the trade legislation, and the deal is an example of how partisan divides can be overcome to resolve a major issue.\n\nThe president said the trade measure will raise labor and environmental standards, not drain the U.S. of high-paying jobs.\n\n\u201cThis legislation will help turn global trade \u2014 which can often be a race to the bottom \u2014 into a race to the top,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cIt will reinforce America\u2019s leadership role in the world \u2014 in Asia, and in Europe and beyond. If I didn\u2019t believe it, I wouldn\u2019t have fought so hard to get these things done.
