Democratic presidential candidate Martin O'Malley on Tuesday unveiled a healthcare plan that would seek to expand healthcare coverage to 95 percent of people in the U.S. over the next few years.

The 10-page plan would build on ObamaCare and crack down on prescription drug costs, among others things.

"The next president must build on the [Affordable Care Act's] success, while continuing to reduce costs, expand access, and improve the quality of care," the plan said.

The plan from the former Maryland governor would ban price gouging for prescription drug costs and use the government's purchasing power to ensure more reasonable prices for drugs.

It would also repeal the so-called "Cadillac" tax on high-cost plans, eliminate waiting periods for Medicaid and improve primary care coverage for new U.S. immigrants.

The proposal would support universal access to reproductive care and family planning services, improve addiction treatment and mental health care and end the criminalization of mental illness.

O'Malley's goal is to expand healthcare insurance to cover 95 percent of people by 2020. He said 36 million people are still uninsured even with ObamaCare, which has provided insurance to nearly 17 million people.

Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, have also presented health care proposals that they say would expand on ObamaCare's successes.

Over the weekend, Clinton proposed a new tax credit for middle-class families to provide care for aging parents or grandparents.
