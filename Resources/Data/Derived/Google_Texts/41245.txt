President Obama’s Fourth of July address was lacking one important element — especially on the occasion of America’s birthday.

It missed the part at the very end, when most presidents — including the current one — say something like “May God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.”

In fact, he didn’t mention God at all.

Instead, he said, “Thanks, everybody. From my family to yours, have a safe and happy Fourth of July.”

He may as well have said, “Tell all your friends you love Obamacare.”

He did remember to thank our country’s heroes in uniform, and he made reference to the proclamation by Founding Father (except he calls them “Founding patriots”) “that all of us are created equal, endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights including the rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.”

“Creator” is good, but doesn’t he want God to bless our nation?

I’m beginning to think he does things like this just to tick people off.

Others on social media thought so too, with one user describing the president as “the Godless little man.”
