"Made in Mississippi." That's not something you think of when it comes to feature films, but many producers and directors are working to change that. In years past, one or two movies would be filmed in Mississippi over a course of a year, but now, countless projects are underway at any given moment.

"There's constantly something going on and it's mostly centered on the coast or in the Jackson area," Mississippi based "Ozland" Director Michael Williams stated. "They are starting to branch out and discover more Mississippi and realize Mississippi really is a great place to make movies. Not just for the locations and the people, but for the film incentives and the actually money, because it's a business."

Mississippi, along with many other southern states, have made an attempt to bring more and more movie projects into the South, especially after the widely popular and successful movie "The Help"

"L.A. is no longer the film-making capital of the world," Williams said. "You know, Louisiana is stealing that from them and the Hollywood South as a whole is doing that. You have Georgia, Louisiana, and Mississippi who are really competing against L.A. and New York and these other big markets that use to be the places you had to go, but now you can stay in the South."

It's thanks in large part to the film incentives that many states give movie studios or directors, all in hopes that they'll bring their movie creativity to the new Hollywood.

The Mississippi Film Office has an incentive program that provides a cash rebate on eligible expenditures, from movies with at least $50,000 invested that don't exceed 10 million dollars. At least 20 percent of the production crew on payroll must be Mississippi Residents.
