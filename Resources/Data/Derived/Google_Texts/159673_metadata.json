The sector is expected to post $146.9 million in sales this year.\n\n\"It's not just end users that are interested in smart thermostat technologies,\" Lauren Callaway, research analyst with Navigant Research, said in a press release announcing the data. \"Today, adoption is increasing in several different customer segments, as utilities, energy retailers, small businesses, and homeowners realize the value in using these devices to manage their energy use and save money.\"\n\nThe latter could be the sweet spot for Pro1, which sells to professional contractors in the heating and cooling trade, Edgar said.\n\nAbout 80 percent of thermostats are professionally installed, he said.\n\nThat market focus is a distinguishing factor from new players such as the Google-owned Nest.\n\n\"The big picture is Nest has brought an extreme awareness to our product category, probably more so than any of the Internet of Things devices,\" Edgar said.\n\nPro1, however, doesn't consider Nest to be a core competitor, Edgar said, noting Nest is sold at retail and a comparably premium price.\n\nPro1's focus remains on continuing its growth trajectory \u2014 a pace that is about seven times that of the overall market, Edgar said.\n\nCiting that the company is privately held, Edgar declined to provide financial information, including annual sales gains.\n\n\"We sell well over 1 million thermostats every year,\" he said.\n\nAlicia Wallace: 303-473-1332, wallacea@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/dc_alicia", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/top-business/ci_27247459/pro1-offices-boulder-enters-smart-thermostat-market", "sailthru.author": "By Alicia Wallace \n \n  Camera Business Writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:27247459:view"}, "startDate": "2015-01-03T11:30:00-0700", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "Since its founding in 2007, Pro1 has grown to become one of the largest manufacturers of thermostats in the nation.", "title": "Pro1, with offices in Boulder, enters 'smart thermostat' market", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/top-business/ci_27247459/pro1-offices-boulder-enters-smart-thermostat-market", "image": "http://local.dailycamera.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/dailycamera.png", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "modificationDate": "2015-01-03T12:09:51-0700", "endDate": "2025-01-02T17:01:24-0700", "news_keywords": "business,economy,technology news,business information,Boulder, Boulder County,Broomfield County,local businesses,tech sector,startups,natural food industry,construction,development,real estate,Boulder,Broomfield,Longmont,Louisville,Lafayette,Colorado", "byline": "By Alicia WallaceCamera", "pubDate": "2015-01-02T17:06:21-0700", "sailthru.date": "2015-01-03T11:30:00-0700", "sailthru.title": "Pro1, with offices in Boulder, enters 'smart thermostat' market", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.section": "Business: Top Business", "description": "Since its founding in 2007, Pro1 has grown to become one of the largest manufacturers of thermostats in the nation.", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/top-business/ci_27247459/pro1-offices-boulder-enters-smart-thermostat-market", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "Since its founding in 2007, Pro1 has grown to become one of the largest manufacturers of thermostats in the nation.", "title": "Pro1, with offices in Boulder, enters 'smart thermostat' market"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674"}, "article_summary": "The broader \"smart thermostat\" market is poised for significant growth in the next decade, according to a report released Dec. 19 by Boulder-based Navigant Research.\nPro1's focus remains on continuing its growth trajectory \u2014 a pace that is about seven times that of the overall market, Edgar said.\n\"It's not just end users that are interested in smart thermostat technologies,\" Lauren Callaway, research analyst with Navigant Research, said in a press release announcing the data.\nTo develop the new thermostat Pro1 enlisted the assistance of Lafayette-based Cardinal Peak to apply its digital and mobile engineering services and Norcross, Ga.-based Comverge to apply its IntelliSource software platform for two-way communications and analytics.\nAnnual global sales for communicating and smart thermostats and associated software and services are projected to be $2.3 billion in 2023, according to Navigant."}
