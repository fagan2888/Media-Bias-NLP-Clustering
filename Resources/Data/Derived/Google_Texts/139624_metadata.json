Pretentious Beer Glass Company\n\nWith a growing body of evidence that beer in moderation \u2014 a glass per day \u2014 can be healthy, a glassmaker has added artistry to the mix, making beer-drinking a truly unique experience one glass at a time.\n\nAfter a bartender incorrectly poured him a half and half \u2014 a mixture of two beers, usually pale ale and stout \u2014 glassmaker Matthew Cummings was inspired to create a new kind of beer glass. He created an elegant dual cup that can hold two different types of brews at once.\n\nHis dual beer cup is the first product to be released by his company, the Pretentious Beer Glass Company, based in Louisville, Kentucky. The compay has a shop on Etsy.\n\nCummings describes his glassmaking process as using \u201ctechniques that haven\u2019t really changed in several hundred years (except for a few safety features),\u201d he writes on his Etsy page. \u201cMolten glass is collected on a hollow blowpipe, and shaped with the use of wet newspaper pads or wooden tools.\u201d\n\nQuality Over Quantity\n\nThe dual beer glass allows beer fans to mix different types of beers and also to experience the scent of two brews simultaneously. Cummings\u2019 other glasses come in unique shapes and sizes, depending on the type of beer they\u2019re meant to contain. His handcrafted pieces \u2014 dubbed \u201cpretentious beer\u201d glasses \u2014 elevate the drinking process, emphasizing the importance of drinking one glass slowly to enjoy the full experience, rather than guzzling down several one after the other.\n\nDrinking a glass of beer per day might have health benefits. A study released earlier this year found that the combination of alcohol and antioxidants in beer may improve heart health. Drinking beer loosens up arteries within an hour or two and increases blood flow to the heart, according to the study.\n\nBeer is also a source of vitamin B, fiber, and humulone, a chemical compound in hops called found to have anti-inflammatory effects.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "dual beer glass, glassmaking, brews, pretentious beer glass", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "After a bartender incorrectly poured a Half and Half, a glassmaker came up with a solution to the beer problem.", "title": "\u2018Pretentious Beer Glass Company\u2019 Cup Holds Two Brews At Once", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pretentious-beer-glass-company-cup-holds-two-brews-once-allows-you-smell-bouquet-both-beers-257532", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/21/dual-beer-glass.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "After a bartender incorrectly poured a Half and Half, a glassmaker came up with a solution to the beer problem.", "title": "\u2018Pretentious Beer Glass Company\u2019 Cup Holds Two Brews At Once", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pretentious-beer-glass-company-cup-holds-two-brews-once-allows-you-smell-bouquet-both-beers-257532", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/21/dual-beer-glass.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/21/dual-beer-glass.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Consumer News", "published_time": "2013-09-21T17:14:42-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-21T17:14:41-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "After a bartender incorrectly poured a Half and Half, a glassmaker came up with a solution to the beer problem."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd5a3e\"", "article_summary": "His dual beer cup is the first product to be released by his company, the Pretentious Beer Glass Company, based in Louisville, Kentucky.\nCummings' dual brew cup creation is one of many \"pretentious\" beer glasses he crafts by hand.\nDrinking beer loosens up arteries within an hour or two and increases blood flow to the heart, according to the study.\nPretentious Beer Glass CompanyWith a growing body of evidence that beer in moderation \u2014 a glass per day \u2014 can be healthy, a glassmaker has added artistry to the mix, making beer-drinking a truly unique experience one glass at a time.\nHe created an elegant dual cup that can hold two different types of brews at once."}
