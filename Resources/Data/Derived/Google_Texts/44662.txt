A narrow victory on the earnings front, coupled with an increase in its own 2014 forecast, pushed shares of DaVita Inc. up 5% to a new all-time high in midday trades Tuesday, making it the second-best performer on the S&P 500.

DaVita /quotes/zigman/268700/delayed /quotes/nls/dva DVA , an operator of dialysis treatment centers, climbed $3.30 to $67.63 in recent action, after the company upped its forecast for 2014 operating income to a range of $1.73 billion to $1.86 billion. Previously, the company predicted income of $1.68 billion to $1.85 billion.

The raised expectations were enough to encourage analysts. Matt Weight, analyst at Feltl and Company, said revenue growth in fourth-quarter earnings, reported late Tuesday, was better than he expected.

“[This year's] operating income guidance was increased on an improved dialysis outlook, and we suspect that will not be the last time,” Feltl said in a note to clients. He added, though, that upcoming Medicare Advantage rate projections from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid — due next week — could dampen share growth.

Margaret Kaczor, analyst at William Blair, pointed out that volume continues to climb at a healthy clip. Growth in the number of patients using DaVita dialysis centers grew 5.2% during the quarter, higher than the 4.7% that was projected.

“The 5.2% unacquired patient growth suggests that the underlying volume growth remains healthy and DaVita is modestly taking share in its current centers,” Kaczor said in her note. “This is faster than organic patient growth for the domestic market of 4%.”

DaVita said fourth-quarter net income was $212.3 million, or 99 cents a share, 36% more than the $155.8 million, or 75 cents a share, for the same period a year ago, and ahead of estimates from analysts polled by Fact Set by a penny. Sales were $3.06 billion against last year’s $2.48 billion, and narrowly beating forecasts of $3.04 billion.
