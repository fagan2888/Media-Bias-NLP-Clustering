He will lie to confuse us. But he will also mix lies with the truth to attack us. \u2026\u201d\n\n\u2013 Father Merrin, \u201cThe Exorcist\u201d\n\nOn May 15, the foundering fish-wrap Newsweek magazine ran a story by Kurt Eichenwald entitled \u201cThe Plots to Destroy America: Conspiracy Theories are a Clear and Present Danger,\u201d which apparently sought to single-handedly debunk every so-called conspiracy theory ever devised while attempting to reinforce the existence of a vast right-wing conspiracy intended to undo all of the good that\u2019s ever been done in the world.\n\nLeading off with the revolt against an \u201caward-winning plan to provide guidance for private-sector developers\u201d designated a \u201ccommunist plot\u201d by the woefully unenlightened residents of Baldwin County, Alabama, and former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin\u2019s condemnation of \u201cdeath panels\u201d under Obamacare, Eichenwald bemoans the supposed proliferation of conspiracy theories, the abject stupidity of their adherents, and furtively touts the kind, wise and benevolent agenda of global elites.\n\nWhat Eichenwald misses (or simply denies) is the fact that a conspiracy theory isn\u2019t a conspiracy theory if there\u2019s a real conspiracy at work.\n\nThe \u201caward-winning plan\u201d to which he refers was indeed a United Nations Agenda 21 design. Like Smart Meters mandated in municipalities and then installed in private homes while local law enforcement stands menacingly by, there are literally hundreds of Agenda 21 \u201csuggestions\u201d in regulatory queues across America, sponsored politically and financially by radical local politicians and ideological millionaires. In my community, we certainly know who they are.\n\n\u201cGeorge W. Bush murdered thousands by orchestrating 9/11. Barack Obama is a Kenyan national and holds the presidency illegally. Education standards developed by state governors are part of an anti-Christian communist plot that will turn children gay. Unemployment rates and the reported numbers for Obamacare sign-ups are lies engineered by the White House.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u201cThe Plots to Destroy America: Conspiracy Theories are a Clear and Present Danger,\u201d Newsweek magazine\n\nNewsweek\u2019s intrepid propagandist mixes lies with the truth, in that he similarly mocks both the most preposterous, nearly universally rejected conspiracy theories and those that have already been proven to be factual. While most Americans don\u2019t believe Bush actually orchestrated 9/11, Gov. Palin\u2019s death panels (and a host of other massive government impositions and \u201cpoison pills\u201d in Obamacare) already exist in the form of bureaucratic contrivances that will force even well-meaning health-care administrators to act as, well, death panels. The emerging Veterans Administration scandal is a poignant object lesson in just this kind of diabolical \u201cmismanagement.\u201d\n\nAccording to Eichenwald, \u201cExperts say the number and significance of conspiracy theories are reaching levels unheard-of in recent times, in part because of ubiquitous and faster communications offered by Internet chat rooms, Twitter and other social media.\u201d\n\nExperts? That\u2019s rather vague \u2013 and quite easy to throw out there. Might they be the same sort of experts as \u201cancient astronaut theorists\u201d who don\u2019t believe that prehistoric humans were able to so much as master peeing on a tree without aid from benevolent \u201cancient aliens\u201d?\n\nEichenwald has a nasty bee in his bonnet regarding Agenda 21 in particular, the U.N.\u2019s ostensibly \u201cnonbinding statement of intent signed in 1992 by President George H.W. Bush and 177 other world leaders\u201d intended to foster management of urban development and land-use policies in ways that minimize the impact on the environment. In the author\u2019s view, this has been seized upon by \u201cextremist organizations\u201d who claim that it is an attempt by statists to seize private property, herd people into cities, impose redistribution of wealth and crush dissent. \u201cTrees will be given the same rights as humans. Electricity companies will conduct surveillance on customers,\u201d he bleats sarcastically.\n\nAs though none of this was actually occurring already.\n\nBack in March, I revealed that a source in the intelligence community had informed me that Malaysian Airlines Flight MH370 was hijacked in a Central Intelligence Agency-sponsored operation reeking of corporate and government intrigue, that the airliner had not crashed and that the manufacturer, Boeing, had likely been involved due to the technical implications of such an undertaking.\n\nI was roundly ridiculed, of course, yet this week Malaysia\u2019s influential former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad accused the CIA and Boeing of having done just that, describing the very scenario I outlined, and detailing how it might have been accomplished in the same way it was initially explained to me. Mohamad also charged that the missing aircraft\u2019s current whereabouts are known to the alleged conspirators.\n\nThis is just one of the recent \u201cconspiracy theories\u201d and \u201cphony scandals\u201d that have either borne out in truth, or appear to contain more than an element of truth.\n\nIn the face of overwhelming evidence for such things as the manipulation and suppression of climate data and a global network of intelligence agencies engaging in counterintelligence against citizens on the Internet, one wonders why a news organization \u2013 or an individual journalist \u2013 would find the wholesale ridicule of conspiracy theories a top priority.\n\nThe obvious answer is that the news organization or journalist has an agenda, one of maintaining the status quo of an uninformed populace. A preponderance of indoctrinated Europeans and undereducated American youth may be content to blindly shamble down this road, blaming shadowy capitalist scapegoats and right-wing extremists all the way.\n\nThose who know better, however, still have all too fresh in our memories the fact that what seemed wild conspiracy theories a year ago \u2013 even to us \u2013 have since been revealed as truth.\n\nMedia wishing to interview Erik Rush, please contact media@wnd.com.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"url": "http://www.wnd.com/2014/05/its-not-a-conspiracy-theory-if-theres-a-real-conspiracy/", "site_name": "WND", "type": "article", "description": "\u201cThe demon is a liar.
