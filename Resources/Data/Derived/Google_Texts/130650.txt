NEW YORK (AP) — Nobody can really believe that Gloria Steinem has just turned 80 years old — and that includes Steinem herself.

“I don’t believe it for a minute,” quipped Steinem, the venerated women’s rights activist, on Friday night at the annual DVF awards, where she was honored with a Lifetime Leadership Award.

“I’ve been stopping people in the street practically,” she said in a brief interview before the awards ceremony, “and saying, ‘You know, I’m having an 80th birthday,’ because I have to convince myself!”

Steinem said she spent her March 25 birthday in Botswana, riding elephants. “I had done it before, and I knew that on my birthday I wanted to be riding elephants,” she said. But was it the best day of her life? No, because she says the best day of her life is yet to come.

“I live in the future,” she said. And besides, she added: “I have to live for another 20 years, because I can’t finish my writing deadlines! So I have to at least make it to 100.”
