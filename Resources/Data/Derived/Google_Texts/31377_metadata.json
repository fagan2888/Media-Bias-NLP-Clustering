The FCC limited so-called joint sales arrangements last year, but now any stations that had such agreements in place as of March 31, 2014, will have a decade more to dissolve them \u2014 until 2025. The congressional action to rollback the FCC\u2019s action had the support not just of Republicans but Democrats like Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Sen. Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.). Dennis Wharton, spokesman for the National Assn. of Broadcasters, said that the FCC was engaging in \u201cpunitive regulatory overreach,\u201d and that the rule \u201cwould have unfairly harmed millions of local television viewers.\u201d An FCC official declined to comment.\n\nCyber-security: A year after the Sony hack, the government now has more tools in its toolkit. CISA was strongly opposed by privacy advocates and some tech firms, but it was rolled into the year-end budget bill. Supporters believe it is needed to enable private companies to share information \u2014 with liability protection in certain cases \u2014 with the government and take action against hacks and data breaches. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce said that CISA \u201cis our best chance yet to help address this economic and national security priority in a meaningful way and help prevent further attacks.\u201d But the Center for Democracy and Technology says that the legislation \u201cpermits information shared under the bill to be used for a myriad purposes completely unrelated to cybersecurity, including prosecuting espionage and trade secrets violations and other crimes.\u201d\n\nShowbiz Incentives: Section 181, a provision of the tax code that has allowed movie and TV producers to immediately deduct production costs up to $15 million, was once again extended, to 2016. Interestingly, Congress continued their practice of retroactively extending the tax break, to expenses from 2015, a practice that has been criticized for making it difficult for producers to depend on the incentive in budget calculations. But the big breakthrough for showbiz this year is the inclusion of Broadway and live theatrical productions in the tax break for the first time.\n\nCadillac tax delay: The Writers Guild of America West had been among the labor groups fighting a long-delayed provision in Obamacare from taking effect. That is the \u201cCadillac tax,\u201d which would impose a 40% excise tax on more expensive health insurance expenditures in higher-quality plans. The intent of the tax was to help limit the rise in healthcare costs and also help fund the Affordable Care Act. \u201cWhile today\u2019s news is welcome, it only reinforces the necessity of further action from Congress \u2013 not just to delay, but to repeal,\u201d said Howard Rodman, president of the WGAW.\n\nPublic television: The budget deal includes $445 million in funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which helps fund PBS, NPR and public broadcasting stations. That funding is actually for fiscal year 2018 \u2014 an advanced appropriation is typical \u2014 and maintains the level of government funding for public broadcasting in recent years. Given that public TV funding can become a target in a presidential election year, as it did in 2012, public station lobbyists are typically relieved when an appropriation goes through without much high drama.
