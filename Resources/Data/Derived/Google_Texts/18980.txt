SAN JOSE — Because Temple upset East Carolina 20-10 this afternoon, the Colorado State Rams most likely would crack the top 25 in at least The Associated Press poll if they beat San Jose State Saturday night (5 p.m. kickoff MDT).

East Carolina (now 6-2 after the loss) was No. 21 in the latest AP poll, No. 23 in the first College Football Playoff rankings, and No. 19 in the USA Today/coaches’ poll. CSU was the first team outside the top 25 in the AP poll, so the Rams figure to move up into the main rankings if the Pirates — as they are about to certain to do — drop out of the top 25.

Wisconsin was “26th” in the USA Today/coaches poll, one spot ahead of the Rams, so the Badgers likely would be the team to jump into the top 25 if only one does this week.

The highest non-power conference team in the College Football Playoff rankings, if there is one among the 25 teams listed, would be guaranteed a bid to the Fiesta, Peach, Cotton or Orange Bowl. East Carolina was the only non-power conference team in those rankings this week. Undefeated Marshall was No. 23 in both AP and USA Today/coaches polls, and the Thundering Herd didn’t play Saturday.

Duke, 24th in all three rankings, beat Pittsburgh 51-48 in double overtime Saturday.

As of this typing, 16 top 25 teams are either playing now or will play later Saturday night.
