The preseason game Thursday against the Seattle Seahawks was the first chance Bronco fans got to see rookie cornerback and first-round draft pick Bradley Roby.

“I did all right,” Roby said. “I gave up too many short passes.”

He did force a fumble in the first half, sticking his helmet on the ball of Seattle running back Christine Michel.

“Yeah. That’s part of my game, though,” Roby said. “I should be doing stuff like that but the short stuff, I can get better. I just have to keep my eyes off the quarterback. I was staring too much. It was my first game, though. I’ll be good. Just got to fix my mistakes and have better practices and have a better game (next Sunday).”

The Broncos play their second preseason game on Sunday, Aug. 17 in Santa Clara, Calif., where they will help the San Francisco 49ers christen Levi’s Stadium.

One of the quarterbacks Roby stared down Thursday was his former Ohio State teammate Terrelle Pryor. A starter for the Oakland Raiders last year, Pryor was the Seahawks’ No. 3 quarterback Thursday. Pryor’s last season at Ohio State was 2010, when Roby was redshirting.

“It was fun laying against Terrelle,” Roby said. “He was trying to get me, too. He saw me when I was playing off. It’s all good. He gave me his shoes.”
