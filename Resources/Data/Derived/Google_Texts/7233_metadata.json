The state placed 46th in that category two years ago and 48th last year.\n\nCalifornia's latest near-bottom ranking is troubling, said Ted Lempert, president of Children Now, the Oakland-based nonpartisan research and policy organization serving as the umbrella group for children's advocates.\n\n\u201cWe have more children living in poverty, and more parents lacking secure employment than we did in 2008,\u201d said Lempert in a news release. There are 2.1 million children living in poverty, and that number has grown by 5 percent since 2008, the start of the recession, the report stated.\n\nAs one of the wealthiest states in the country, California \u201ccan and should aim to be number one in supporting kids and families,\u201d Lempert said.\n\nAccording to Children Now, the economic recovery \u201csidestepped communities of color, leaving African American and Latino children particularly vulnerable to the negative effects of poverty, including diminished school performance and poor health conditions.\u201d\n\nIn the area of education, California saw the percentage of children not in preschool grow to 4.4 million in the years 2011 to 2013. It showed improvement in 4th-grade reading proficiency, 8th-grade math proficiency and high school graduation measures.\n\nThe group said to improve its ranking in health and other critical areas, California needs to support and expand quality programs that help children thrive.\n\nKIDS COUNT - California and U.S. Profiles\n\nSource: KIDS COUNT Data Book, Annie E.
