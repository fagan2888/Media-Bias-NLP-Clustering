It was September 2004.\n\nMcClinton had been Wilson\u2019s go-to director for more than a decade. Two years earlier, he had staged the world premiere of Wilson\u2019s \u201cGem of the Ocean\u201d at the Goodman Theatre in Chicago. Now the drama was in rehearsals at the Huntington in Boston before its transfer to Broadway.\n\nWilson was gentle but direct with his friend of 25-plus years.\n\n\u201cHe said that he had called Kenny,\u201d McClinton said. That would be stage director Kenny Leon, who was replacing McClinton as director.\n\n\u201cAugust told me to take care of myself, my health. He cried. I cried. We cried some more,\u201d McClinton recalled. \u201cBut I understood it and knew the importance, not only of this production, but of his entire play cycle. That\u2019s what he had to do.\u201d\n\nThe lifts and turns of fortune\u2019s wheel are unpredictable. Wilson died a year later. Leon\u2019s career took off, hitting a peak in his recent Tony win for the Broadway revival of Lorraine Hansberry\u2019s \u201cA Raisin in the Sun,\u201d which starred Denzel Washington.\n\nMcClinton, diagnosed with kidney disease, went home to St. Paul to focus on his health after years traveling as an award-winning director who specialized in Wilson\u2019s extraordinary plays about black life in 20th-century America.\n\nHe began spending more time at home with his wife, theater teacher Jan Mandell, and son, Jesse Mandell-McClinton.\n\n\u201cMy first memories of my family were of my dad on the road,\u201d said Mandell-McClinton, 24, an aspiring writer in Austin, Texas. \u201cI got to see the country and the world through his work. And he was happiest, most fulfilled that way. I was mad when they let him go.\u201d\n\nBattling depression\n\nMcClinton\u2019s return was an ominous time. For the first two weeks, his son recalled, his father would lie for long stretches on the basement floor in their house near St. Paul\u2019s Merriam Park. The depression eventually lifted.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how my family works,\u201d said Mandell-McClinton. \u201cMy dad has this amazing capacity to be outside of himself, and to arrive at what he needs to do to take care of himself.\u201d\n\nMcClinton\u2019s regimen for the kidney disease that had caused acute pain intermittently for years included dialysis three times per week. As he adjusted to the treatment of his body, McClinton said, his mind and creative powers grew.\n\nRegaining his confidence, he began directing again \u2014 gemlike productions that ranged from new plays to Shakespeare. The man described by Peter Brosius of Children\u2019s Theatre as \u201cone of the greats of American theater\u201d had proved himself at home and abroad. He was nominated for a Tony for Wilson\u2019s \u201cKing Hedley II,\u201d and he won an Obie for \u201cJitney,\u201d a production McClinton took to London, where it won an Olivier Award.\n\nNow, his hometown would get to see more of his celebrated artistry. McClinton staged works on Twin Cities stages such as Pillsbury House, Park Square, Children\u2019s Theatre and the Guthrie.\n\nSoft-spoken, ruminative\n\n\u201cTheater for me is not about playing, but about life,\u201d said McClinton. He speaks in a raspy baritone with wheezing around the edges, a result of the asthma he\u2019s had since childhood. McClinton, 60, is fond of baseball caps that hide his all-gray hair. Even though he has lost 30 pounds in the past few months, he has the frame of someone you might peg for a ballplayer. An avid sports fan, McClinton\u2019s deepest passion always was for the dramatic arts.\n\nHe also felt confident enough to go back on the road, working at major regional playhouses in Ohio and Oregon, where he directed \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird,\u201d a production that sold out before opening night.\n\n\u201cMarion\u2019s national reputation was that of a powerhouse, as one of our nation\u2019s most accomplished artists,\u201d said Bill Rauch, artistic director of the Oregon Shakespeare Festival.\n\n\u201cMockingbird\u201d was complicated, because it is \u201cone of the most famous stories of racial injustice that was written by and told from the perspective of white people,\u201d Rauch said. \u201cHe handled those complications with great humor, and a directness that was sometimes startling and always heartfelt and refreshing.\u201d\n\nSeeking focus\n\nThe middle child of an elevator operator father who also operated a gambling boat on the St. Croix River, and a mother who took in foster children, McClinton grew up in St. Paul, not expecting to make it out of his 20s.\n\n\u201cBetween drugs, violence and the police, not many of us did,\u201d he said. His loving parents scrimped, and his father saved the proceeds from that gambling boat, so that they could send their children to Catholic school.\n\nAfter graduation, McClinton enrolled at the University of St. Thomas. He left after his freshman year because, he recalled, they had a faux-slave day, where a person would be auctioned and become someone\u2019s captive for a spell. The practice, he said, was \u201cdeeply offensive.\u201d\n\nMcClinton transferred to the University of Minnesota, but did not complete his degree. He was unfocused, he said, and enjoyed drinking and partying too much.\n\nMarlon Brando changed some of that. \u201cI remember once they had a Brando marathon on, and I was like, man, that\u2019s the real [talent],\u201d he said. \u201cBrando became a different person for each film. I wanted to do that.\u201d\n\nMcClinton dreamed about Hollywood. \u201cI wanted to go out there, but I had no money,\u201d he said. When he saw a legendary production of \u201cThe Great White Hope\u201d starring Ernie Hudson at Theatre in the Round in 1975, McClinton knew that his dreams could flower at home.\n\n\u201cIt showed me the power of theater,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a game-changer.\u201d\n\nA second chance\n\nThat \u201cGreat White Hope\u201d changed things on the Twin Cities theater scene. It\u2019s credited with paving the way for the creation of Mixed Blood Theatre. Lou Bellamy directed the first show at Mixed Blood before going on to found Penumbra.\n\n\u201cI owe so much to Penumbra,\u201d said McClinton. \u201cAll the ensemble work I do, all the stuff I\u2019ve done, that place has been the sanctuary. It\u2019s where I learned the things that I\u2019ve done everywhere. It\u2019s where I became a man.\u201d\n\nThat McClinton was hired by Penumbra in the first place was itself an opportunity for redemption. In his 20s, McClinton was, by his own admission, a heavy drinker. (He has been sober for nearly 30 years.) He got a part in a play at a local theater but missed the final preview when he overslept after a big night of carousing. He was fired.\n\nMcClinton asked Bellamy for a chance to join his new company. Bellamy said yes. \u201cIn those days, Marion was always getting arrested, not because he did anything, but because he fit the profile of a young black man,\u201d Bellamy recalled. \u201cI remember one time they put Marion in a lineup and asked him to say, \u2018Gimme that purse, bitch!\u2019 He wouldn\u2019t do it.\u201d\n\nPenumbra gave McClinton a chance to read plays and act. He also ran props and worked backstage.\n\n\u201cLike all of us energized, exercised and sometimes angry young men who wanted justice and a fair chance in this society, theater \u2014 and specifically, literature from the Black Arts Movement \u2014 gave us a compass into manhood,\u201d said Bellamy. \u201cThe society was telling us one thing, but this literature connected us to a history of great thinking and to a future.\u201d\n\nAt Penumbra, McClinton hung out with actors James A. Williams and Terry Bellamy. The three were sparring partners who dreamed of conquering the world. \u201cWe used to go to Dixie\u2019s bar in St. Paul and plot what we were going to do,\u201d McClinton said. \u201cWe were like Scorsese and those guys.\u201d\n\nWilliams and another actor, Russell Curry, would do this thing called \u201cDueling Brandos,\u201d said Williams. \u201cIt was a popular \u2018SNL\u2019 skit at the time between Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi. Marion\u2019s always been one of the more brilliant writers, actors and directors around. He was always putting his dream casts in his head.\u201d\n\nWhile first an actor at Penumbra, McClinton also grew into a playwright. He won a new-play competition at the St. Paul playhouse early on, and his own plays, including \u201cWalkers\u201d and \u201cPolice Boys,\u201d were the ones that first took him and his Twin Cities colleagues to New York.\n\n\u2018He sees things in you\u2019\n\nLater, after his experiences on Broadway, McClinton has served as a resource for other Twin Cities-based talent.\n\n\u201cWhen I got my first Broadway job, Marion reviewed my contract,\u201d Williams said.\n\nMcClinton cast actor Regina Marie Williams in \u201cOthello,\u201d her first Shakespeare play.\n\n\u201cHe sees things in you, in your talent, that sometimes not even you see,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s a director you would run through a wall for.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe has this way of humanizing the material, making it visceral and actable,\u201d said Tracie Thoms, a regular on TV\u2019s \u201cCold Case,\u201d who made her Broadway debut in \u201cDrowning Crow,\u201d directed by McClinton. \u201cHis approach to the story, and to life, is not technical. It\u2019s about the soul of the character, the person.\u201d\n\nMcClinton is still in rebuilding mode, but he has a glow about him these days.\n\n\u201cPeople in the industry have this false idea that concerns about his health hold him back,\u201d said Mandell-McClinton, describing his father\u2019s determination and work ethic. \u201cBut he\u2019s always fought his body to do his work. My dad never quits.\u201d\n\nPlaywright, director and producer Carlyle Brown, who has known McClinton for about 30 years, said that he comes fully alive in theater.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like he somehow wills excellence,\u201d said. \u201cPeople sometimes get worried for him. Is he going to take his medication? Is he going to be all right? But then you get to opening night, and you are blown away. The work \u2014 theater \u2014 heals him.\u201d\n\nMcClinton sees the body as a vessel for something larger, call it artistic transcendence, health concerns be damned.\n\n\u201cI broke my ankle when I was doing \u2018In the Red and Brown Water,\u2019 \u201d he said of a celebrated production that launched the McCraney trilogy. \u201cIf I need to break something every time I do a play to get the same result, I\u2019d take that bet.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Marion McClinton grew up in St. Paul, dropped out of college, educated himself and became a powerhouse in American theater.", "og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "Marion McClinton grew up in St. Paul, dropped out of college, educated himself and became a powerhouse in American theater.", "title": "Marion McClinton: A man made by theater", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/marion-mcclinton-a-man-made-by-theater/270407921/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_140745446232684.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_140745446232684.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Marion McClinton grew up in St. Paul, dropped out of college, educated himself and became a powerhouse in American theater.", "title": "Marion McClinton: A man made by theater", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/marion-mcclinton-a-man-made-by-theater/270407921/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_140745446232684.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_140745446232684.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "article": {"tag": "august wilson"}, "news_keywords": "Marion McClinton,august wilson"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf2bc\"", "article_summary": "The work \u2014 theater \u2014 heals him.\u201dMcClinton sees the body as a vessel for something larger, call it artistic transcendence, health concerns be damned.\nDirector Marion McClinton was in a Boston hospital bed when playwright August Wilson came to see him.\nThe man described by Peter Brosius of Children\u2019s Theatre as \u201cone of the greats of American theater\u201d had proved himself at home and abroad.\nMy dad never quits.\u201dPlaywright, director and producer Carlyle Brown, who has known McClinton for about 30 years, said that he comes fully alive in theater.\nThat would be stage director Kenny Leon, who was replacing McClinton as director."}
