Earle is the predecessor of Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, whose drunk driving escapades initiated the chain of events that has now culminated in Governor Perry\u2019s indictment.\n\nServing as Texas state treasurer, Hutchison won 67 percent of the vote in the special election held on June 5, 1993, to fill the Senate seat that had been held by Lloyd Bentsen, who had resigned to serve as Secretary of the Treasury in the Clinton administration. It was a matter of months \u2014 a little over three, to be precise \u2014 before Earle engineered Hutchison\u2019s indictment on charges stemming from her service as treasurer. Hutchison was indicted on felony charges of official misconduct and ordering Texas state employees to destroy evidence.\n\nHutchison anticipated running for election to a full Senate term in November 1994. A conviction on trumped up charges would have served the Democrats\u2019 interest handily in removing her from the picture. I recall the late political reporter Jack Germond laughing about it at the time. I remember because I failed to see the humor. Through his chuckle, Germond observed: \u201cThey play hardball in Texas.\u201d\n\nWith Hutchison\u2019s trial just minutes under way the following February, the case against Hutchison was thrown out. The Los Angeles Times reported the acquittal here. Hutchison commented at a press conference following her acquittal: \u201cThey thought the lady would crack. Well, the lady wouldn\u2019t crack. The lady stood up and fought. The lady showed she could take the worst that a corruption of the political system could give.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe only crime I committed,\u201d she said, \u201cwas doing a great job as state treasurer and winning an election by a landslide.\u201d\n\nThe charges against Perry seem to me absurd on their face. By contrast with the cases against Hutchison and DeLay brought by Earle, however, the case against Perry has been brought by a special prosecutor who is a widely respected Texas defense attorney and former prosecutor (Michael McCrum). Nevertheless, the charges amount to something like a glorified joke.\n\nAdjusting for the fact that Perry is the longest serving governor in Texas history and has won several elections by impressive margins \u2014 elections including a 2010 primary contest with Senator Hutchison herself \u2014 I trust the day will come when he will be able to make a declaration like Hutchison\u2019s. The early arrival of the day is a consummation devoutly to be wished.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Power Line", "description": "Many of us recall the baseless indictment of then House Majority Leader Tom DeLay by then Travis County District Attorney Ronnie Earle in connection with the indictment of Governor Perry yesterday,\u2026", "title": "When they harassed Hutchison", "url": "http://on.powerlineblog.com/archives/2014/08/when-they-harassed-hutchison.php", "image": "http://www.powerlineblog.com/wp-content/themes/powerline/images/icon.png", "locale": "en_US", "type": "powerlineblog:article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@powerlineus", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "NOODP", "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "fb": {"admins": "505151,john.hinderaker,scottwynnjohnson,750972908", "app_id": 154257474630565}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-16T13:02:40+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-16T19:59:05+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Hutchison was indicted on felony charges of official misconduct and ordering Texas state employees to destroy evidence.\nServing as Texas state treasurer, Hutchison won 67 percent of the vote in the special election held on June 5, 1993, to fill the Senate seat that had been held by Lloyd Bentsen, who had resigned to serve as Secretary of the Treasury in the Clinton administration.\nHutchison commented at a press conference following her acquittal: \u201cThey thought the lady would crack.\nHutchison anticipated running for election to a full Senate term in November 1994.\nThrough his chuckle, Germond observed: \u201cThey play hardball in Texas.\u201dWith Hutchison\u2019s trial just minutes under way the following February, the case against Hutchison was thrown out."}
