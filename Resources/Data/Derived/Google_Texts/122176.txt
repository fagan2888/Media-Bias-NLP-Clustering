He also criticized some Republican appointed Justices as “screaming train wreck disasters.”

“You know, Democrats are batting almost 1.000 when it comes to Supreme Court nominees,” Cruz stated to the Heritage Action presidential forum’s audience in South Carolina. “Every Supreme Court nominee they put forward votes like a radical leftist nutcase.”

“Republicans, we bat about .500,” Cruz added. “About half of Republican Supreme Court justices actually honor their oath to defend the Constitution. The other half are screaming trainwreck disasters. Earl Warren was a Republican nominee. Bill Brennan was a Republican nominee. John Paul Stevens, David Souter, Harry Blackmun, who authored Roe vs. Wade was a Republican nominee.”

Cruz argued about nine cases in front of the Supreme Court during his time as solicitor general of Texas.
