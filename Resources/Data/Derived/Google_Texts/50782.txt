Lisa Wilson made sure to dance with her father at her wedding before he died.

Most girls grow up with a vision of the wedding they’ll one day have, from the venue to the dress they’ll wear and the types of flowers they’ll have arranged into centerpieces. Lisa Wilson of Victorville, Calif., was no different — or at least she was until her father was diagnosed with a rare cancer.

Wilson, of course, wanted her father to witness the ceremony, so she rearranged her wedding plans to get married in the University of California, Irvine Medical Center in Orange, Calif., where her father was a patient. More importantly, Wilson wanted to share that traditional father-daughter dance.

“I asked him, ‘I said daddy I want to do my father-daughter dance with you,’” Wilson told CBS. “He said, ‘I can’t dance and I said you don’t have to. I want to dance with your hands.’”

Holding her father’s hands, Wilson swayed along to Whitney Houston’s “I Will Always Love You.” Not long after the two were able to share this special moment, Wilson’s father died.

While Wilson was able to get her father to dance, Robert Pantoja, her now-husband, was able to receive some words of wisdom. “He looked at me, he goes ‘Rob, you’re the lucky one. You won the lottery, you got my baby girl,'” Pantoja told CBS.
