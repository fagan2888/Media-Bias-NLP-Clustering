This is especially impressive since he\u2019s often great; a talented songwriter with a quick wit and (at least early in his career) an ability to assimilate diverse styles without compromising his own vision. These strengths, though, were accompanied by real weaknesses. As a singer, he mimicked the roughness of roots sources without capturing their nuance or power, often resulting in self-parody. As a lyricist, he had a tendency to mistake Beat poet doggerel bathos for profundity. It often seems like he\u2019s been celebrated as much for the flaws as for the virtues \u2014 his incompetence seen as punk rock authenticity and his pomposity as literary bona fides.\n\nInevitably, given his status as ultimate awesome courageous rock God, Dylan has influenced just about everybody. And, inevitably too, given the gap between his standing and his sometimes quite good but rarely godlike music, many of those he\u2019s influenced have outshown him. Below is a list of just a few performers influenced by Dylan who are better than he is.\n\nJimi Hendrix, \u201cWait Until Tomorrow\u201d\n\n\n\nThis is probably the least controversial suggestion on the list; Hendrix is one of the few performers whose reputation approaches the stratospheric heights of Zimmerman\u2019s. His cover of \u201cAll Along the Watchtower\u201c is his most famous Dylan lift, and the song certainly benefits from Hendrix\u2019s more expressive singing, as well as from the hard rock sturm und drung that distracts somewhat from the half-baked fantasy lyrics. But I think something like \u201cWait Until Tomorrow\u201d is maybe a better showcase. The humor and the forays into tongue-twisting wordplay (\u201cthe mixed-up mind of you\u201d) touch on Dylan, even as the song employs a gut-bucket, loose-limbed virtuosity that is simultaneously more swaggering and rootsier than anything Dylan ever put together.\n\nDonovan, \u201cGet Thy Bearings\u201d\n\n\n\nDonovan was initially billed as the British Bob Dylan, and early tracks like \u201cCatch the Wind\u201d were certainly heavily influenced by Dylan\u2019s latter-day Guthrie shtick. Donovan\u2019s range was always greater than his American contemporary\u2019s, though, and his combination of ominously fey British folk with pop and rock was significantly odder and more original. \u201cGet Thy Bearings\u201d sounds like Steely Dan for faerie singalong; certainly a funnier, and slyer, folk betrayal than Dylan going electric.\n\nJohnny Cash and June Carter Cash, \u201cIt Ain\u2019t Me, Babe\u201d\n\n\n\nCash loved Dylan\u2019s music, and covered a number of his songs over the years. This duet with June is probably the most famous \u2014 and also a good indication of why Cash is superior to his source material. Dylan\u2019s version of \u201cIt Ain\u2019t Me, Babe\u201d is fairly straightforward; a kiss-off song that teeters on the edge of puerile bad-boy self-mythologizing. Cash\u2019s version doesn\u2019t teeter, though; he hams it up, from the sneered \u201cNo, No, No\u201d which is phrased as \u201cNyah, Nyah, Nyah\u201d to the way he spits out \u201cBabe!\u201d all done with mountain chorus harmonies and horns in the background. Cash is willing to emphasize the song\u2019s ridiculousness. Dylan wasn\u2019t \u2014 either out of misplaced sedateness or, less charitably, because he didn\u2019t realize how ridiculous it was.\n\nVelvet Underground, \u201cRun Run Run\u201d\n\n\n\nDylan\u2019s influence on Lou Reed\u2019s New Yawk talk-singing is obvious, but you can hear \u201cHighway 61 Revisited\u201d and \u201cBlonde on Blonde\u201d in the artsy rootsy groove of something like \u201cRun Run Run\u201d as well. Reed\u2019s collaborators were a lot more well-equipped to combine high-art cool and primitive throb than Dylan was, though, and Reed\u2019s lyrics, at this stage of his career, anyway, channel Dylan\u2019s snark without his forays into bathos (need I mention the embarrassment that is \u201cJust Like a Woman\u201d?) In a lot of ways, \u201cThe Velvet Underground and Nico\u201d could be seen as the perfect Dylan album, the one the man himself never quite managed.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jim Hendrix, Neil Young and Joni Mitchell are among the Dylan disciples who prove how overrated he is VIDEO", "title": "10 musicians influenced by Bob Dylan who are better than Bob Dylan", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Jim Hendrix, Neil Young and Joni Mitchell are among the Dylan disciples who prove how overrated he is VIDEO", "title": "10 musicians influenced by Bob Dylan who are better than Bob Dylan", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/14/10_musicians_influenced_by_bob_dylan_who_are_better_than_bob_dylan/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/bob_dylan2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Jim Hendrix, Neil Young and Joni Mitchell are among the Dylan disciples who prove how overrated he is VIDEO", "title": "10 musicians influenced by Bob Dylan who are better than Bob Dylan", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/bob_dylan2.jpg", "creator": "@hoodedu", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Noah Berlatsky", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Bob Dylan, Jimi Hendrix, Johnny Cash, lists, Music, Neil Young, sly stone, The Beatl, The Beatles, Video", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Cash\u2019s version doesn\u2019t teeter, though; he hams it up, from the sneered \u201cNo, No, No\u201d which is phrased as \u201cNyah, Nyah, Nyah\u201d to the way he spits out \u201cBabe!\u201d all done with mountain chorus harmonies and horns in the background.\nVelvet Underground, \u201cRun Run Run\u201dDylan\u2019s influence on Lou Reed\u2019s New Yawk talk-singing is obvious, but you can hear \u201cHighway 61 Revisited\u201d and \u201cBlonde on Blonde\u201d in the artsy rootsy groove of something like \u201cRun Run Run\u201d as well.\nBelow is a list of just a few performers influenced by Dylan who are better than he is.\nInevitably, given his status as ultimate awesome courageous rock God, Dylan has influenced just about everybody.\nJohnny Cash and June Carter Cash, \u201cIt Ain\u2019t Me, Babe\u201dCash loved Dylan\u2019s music, and covered a number of his songs over the years."}
