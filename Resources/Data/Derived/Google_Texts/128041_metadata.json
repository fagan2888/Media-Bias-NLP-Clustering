It thrives in dense housing, shared living spaces, and areas with poor ventilation. The infected can spread tuberculosis through the air when they cough and sneeze. Drug-resisistant strains of TB are on the rise, threatening a global crisis.\n\nMore than one million people worldwide \u2014 particularly those living in areas with poor health care systems \u2014 succumb to the disease each year, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Defeating tuberculosis depends of proper use of medication, as prescribed by doctors. If left untreated, the disease poses great risk to infected people and those in their immediate surroundings.\n\nTo mitigate the risk of tuberculosis mutating into a deadlier, antibiotic-resistant strain, patients have to take a cocktail of antibiotics over the course of six months, as suggested by WHO. But that doesn\u2019t happen often, a recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) study found. According to the study, health care providers in 75 percent of U.S. hospitals often prescribe the wrong dosage of prescription medication to their patients.\n\nExperts say that mismanagement and misuse of prescription medication may have caused more than 70 cases of drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in the United States in 2013. In the previous year, China and India reported a combined 124,000 cases, which proliferated in areas where people lived in close quarters.\n\n\u201cWhat could happen is progressively multi-drug resistant TB takes over from normal tuberculosis,\u201d Dr. Mario Raviglione, the director of the WHO\u2019s Global Tuberculosis program, told BBC News last year. \u201cIf this happens, not only would millions of patients potentially die of this form of TB, but if I look at it from an economic perspective the cost of dealing with millions of potential cases is enormous.\u201d\n\nExperts say TB\u2019s comeback is partly because it is regarded as a \u201cdisease of poverty,\u201d and because pharmaceutical companies assumed that current vaccinations would eliminate the disease. The Tuberculosis Vaccine Initiative, a Netherlands-based organization dedicated to the research and development of new tuberculosis vaccines, says that efficient drug therapies, new vaccines, and accurate diagnoses can quell the spread of the disease and save tens of millions of lives across the world.\n\nWhile a host of vaccinations \u2014 including BCG, TBVI, and Aeras \u2014 have either been developed or are currently undergoing the development stages, many hurdles exist in doling out treatment.\n\nBetween 2001 and 2011, prices of vaccine packages that treat nearly a dozen diseases increased by more than 2700 percent, according to the Public Library of Science. A 2011 UNICEF Supply Division data set also showed that Western pharmaceutical companies charged the United Nations program more for its products than its Indian and Indonesian counterparts.\n\nWhile the Affordable Care Act, dubbed as Obamacare, allows poor people to receive complementary preventative care \u2014 which includes immunizations, screening, and tests \u2014 Texas\u2019 low income residents may not be able to use those services, due to the state\u2019s refusal to expand Medicaid.\n\nTexas currently leads the nation in the number of uninsured with 6 million people \u2014 one out of six of whom is children. Uncompensated medical treatment costs the state $4 billion annually, according to a letter that judges from Texas\u2019 six largest counties sent to state legislators in August. A White House report released that month stated that Medicaid expansion would cover 1.2 million Texans by 2016.\n\nIn the Lone Star State, where tuberculosis affects Latinos and African Americans in great number, proper vaccination can be effective against the disease that\u2019s been called a silent killer. This reality holds especially true for low-income children, a group found often to not be up to date on their vaccinations. As the CDC said in its recent report, early immunization can prevent excessive school absences and lower future health care costs.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "A worker infected with tuberculosis interacted with patients in Providence Memorial Hospital\u2019s nursery for nearly a year before doctors diagnosed him with the disease.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "A worker infected with tuberculosis interacted with patients in Providence Memorial Hospital\u2019s nursery for nearly a year before doctors diagnosed him with the disease.", "title": "More Than 700 Newborn Babies Exposed To Tuberculosis", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/09/20/3570086/tuberculosis-outbreak-has-texas-hospital-under-siege/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/shutterstock_173603198.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A worker infected with tuberculosis interacted with patients in Providence Memorial Hospital\u2019s nursery for nearly a year before doctors diagnosed him with the disease.", "creator": "@SamPKCollins", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/shutterstock_173603198-321x214.jpg", "title": "More Than 700 Newborn Babies Exposed To Tuberculosis", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/shutterstock_173603198.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/shutterstock_173603198.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-20T13:41:13+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/sampkcollinswriter"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Health More Than 700 Newborn Babies Exposed To Tuberculosis CREDIT: ShutterstockOfficials in a Texas hospital are scrambling to give free screenings and follow-up care to more than 700 newborns and 40 employees thought to have been exposed to tuberculosis, the El Paso Times reported Friday.\nThe infected can spread tuberculosis through the air when they cough and sneeze.\nAs the CDC said in its recent report, early immunization can prevent excessive school absences and lower future health care costs.\nAccording to the study, health care providers in 75 percent of U.S. hospitals often prescribe the wrong dosage of prescription medication to their patients.\n\u201cTB is a serious but treatable disease that is spread through the air,\u201d the health department said in a letter to parents."}
