Chuck Schumer on Meet the Press:\n\n\u201cWell, I think we will hold the Senate. You know, I know all the pundits are saying Republicans will take the Senate. Democrats are going to prove the pundits wrong on Election Day when we keep the Senate, three reasons. First and foremost, economic issues predominate. Ebola's in the news, ISIS is in the news, but the average voter, every poll shows far and away, cares most about economic issues. They tend to be for Democrats when economic issues like minimum wage, like equal pay for women, like not sending jobs overseas predominate. Second, we have a much better ground game. You can add two to three points at a minimum\u2026for each of those races. Just about every one of those races. So if it's 44, 43 [percentage points], we're probably ahead. And third, as the race get down to the final moments, the voters focus on the two candidates. Not on the national referendum. When the two candidates are compared almost inevitably, we do better. So economic issues, better ground game, better candidates will put us over the top November.\u201d\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Election results 2014 by state, county and district)\n\nFormer Gov. Bill Richardson on This Week :\n\n\u201cThe Hispanic vote\u2014everyone\u2019s talking about what they\u2019re going to do. I think that Sen.Mark Udall will pull through because of the Hispanic vote. In Illinois, that\u2019s a growing Hispanic population. I think Gov. Quinn is gonna win that one. Georgia, nine percent of the vote there is now Hispanic. I think that\u2019s going to help Sam Nunn\u2019s daughter\u2026 In New Mexico, I\u2019m going to go way out on a limb and predict Attorney General Gary King defeating Susana Martinez\u2026[Republicans] are not doing well because of their very harsh stance on immigration reform.\u201d\n\nMarc Lamont Hill on State of the Union , discussing a Washington Post headline about the protests in Ferguson:\n\n\u201c\u2018Dubious Practices in Ferguson\u2019 that actually is mobilizing people of color to polls. \u2026 In North Carolina that could be a difference maker.\u201d\n\nBarack Obama at a DNC fundraiser:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re gonna make one last push in these last several weeks. We\u2019ve got a lot of just nail-biter races\u2026If we do what we\u2019re supposed to do, then I\u2019m actually confident that we can get it done.\u201d\n\n( POLITICO Pro: Harry Reid to run for minority leader)\n\nKimberley A. Strassel in the Wall Street Journal :\n\n\u201cOregon is a perfect example. The liberal state is competitive because it is a stunning microcosm of the Obamacare disaster. The FBI is investigating 'Cover Oregon,' the state online exchange that officials spent three years and $250 million creating, yet which never signed up a person. The cost of health care has soared in the state, and many Oregonians have lost their doctors. The majority of residents hate Obamacare, and Mr. Merkley\u2014a freshman senator who has done little in D.C.\u2014is sitting on way-upside-down approval ratings.\u201d\n\nJohn Fund in National Review :\n\n\u201c\u2018Landslide reelection races for governor produce low turnout,\u2019 Harrison Schmitt, a former Republic senator from New Mexico, once told me. That (plus Obama\u2019s 38 percent approval rating) gives Udall\u2019s opponent, businessman Allen Weh, a chance to pull an upset \u2014 especially if he pulls money out of his own wallet for last-minute ads.\u201d\n\nChris Hayes on All In:\n\n\u201cThe ground game may save Begich in the end. According to Yahoo News, Democrats have spent, get this, ten times more than Republicans on field operations in the state of Alaska. \u2026This election cycle is the most tightly contested in recent memory, far more than the midterm elections of 2006 or 2010. All of it underscoring the tremendous volatility and potential for last minute shifts. \u201d\n\n( POLITICO Pro: Larry Hogan beats Brown in Maryland shocker)\n\nHouse Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer, via CNN\u2019s Deirdre Walsh:\n\n\u201cPoint[ing] to a fundraising advantage for Democrats, lower poll numbers for congressional Republicans, divisions inside the GOP ranks, and a good recruiting class of Democratic challengers, [Hoyer] said \u2018all of those combined in my view give me great optimism that we're going to win back the House.\u2019\u201d\n\nFred Yang, Democratic pollster, on Meet the Press:\n\n\u201cThe things we need to have happen on Election Day in a lot of these close states is maybe coming into fruition. For a while now there\u2019s been a voter interest enthusiasm gap between Republicans and Democrats. Now Democrats are catching up\u2026With registered voters, which is a broader electorate than likely voters, the Democrats still have a four point edge.\u201d\n\nDNC Chairwoman Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz on This Week:\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re going to hold the Senate and the reason that we\u2019re going to hold the Senate\u2026is because we have a ground game that, I know [RNC Chairman] Reince [Priebus] would take ours over theirs any day of the week. \u2026Rick Scott is going to go down to defeat on Tuesday.\u201d\n\n( Also on POLITICO: No Obama pivot after midterms)\n\nMark Halperin on Face the Nation :\n\n\u201cIf the Senate\u2019s on the line there\u2019s a chance that\u2026Michelle Nunn could win in the runoffs.\u201d\n\nDSCC Communications Director Justin Barasky, via Fox News :\n\n\u201cDemocrats continue to be in a strong position to hold the majority. For the past two cycles, Democrats have outperformed election forecasts and polling averages and are poised to do so once again. Democrats are running stronger, smarter campaigns with better candidates who are focused, not on the politics of fear, but on the issues that matter most to the middle class.\u201d\n\nGeorge F. Will in the Washington Post :\n\n\u201cGiven the enormous and growing role of medicine in this aging nation\u2019s economy, it is unfortunate that only three senators are physicians: Wyoming Republican John Barrasso, an orthopedic surgeon, Oklahoma Republican Tom Coburn, an obstetrician, and Kentucky Republican Rand Paul, an ophthalmologist. Coburn is retiring, but another doctor [Oregon\u2019s Monica Wehby] may be coming, straight from the operating room to her first elected office.\u201d\n\nFollow @politico", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO Magazine", "description": "Prepare yourself a healthy serving of crow and wipe the egg off your face.", "title": "The Worst Predictions of 2014", "url": "http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/11/the-worst-predictions-of-2014-112582.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/11/05/141105_lerner_schumer_gty.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "2014 Elections,Midterm Elections,Politics", "twitter": {"site": "@politicomag", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politicomag"}, "description": "Prepare yourself a healthy serving of crow and wipe the egg off your face.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce97b\"", "article_summary": "So economic issues, better ground game, better candidates will put us over the top November.\u201d( Also on POLITICO: Election results 2014 by state, county and district)Former Gov.\nDemocrats are going to prove the pundits wrong on Election Day when we keep the Senate, three reasons.\nFor the past two cycles, Democrats have outperformed election forecasts and polling averages and are poised to do so once again.\nThey tend to be for Democrats when economic issues like minimum wage, like equal pay for women, like not sending jobs overseas predominate.\nFor a while now there\u2019s been a voter interest enthusiasm gap between Republicans and Democrats."}
