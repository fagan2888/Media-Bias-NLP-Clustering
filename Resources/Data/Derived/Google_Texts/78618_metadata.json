It\u2019s far enough to get away but close enough so you can actually do it and not completely destroy yourself.\u201d\n\nAnd the atmosphere is wildly different.\n\n\u201cEvery window out of our house,\u201d he says, \u201cyou see horses, whether mine or the neighbors\u2019. It\u2019s great. You hear that rolling thunder, and you look out back, and there\u2019s 20 yearlings running across the field.\n\n\u201cI have just quarter horses. Around here, it\u2019s all Standardbreds and Thoroughbreds, but I\u2019m the one with the ugly horses on the block.\u201d\n\nAs for whether a down-home guy buys his show\u2019s brainy high concept, Zahn says, \u201cIt\u2019s somewhat of a stretch but not really. We live with this kind of manipulation daily, whether it be commercials or polls. There\u2019s a lot of science behind all of that.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing how we are really just passengers in our own brains, but we think we\u2019re in control. We think we\u2019re the pilots of the jumbo jet, but we\u2019re really a mouse in the belly of the plane.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Steve Zahn plays Clark Edwards on &quot;Mind Games,&quot; whose bipolar disorder -- and his affair with an undergraduate -- upended his career as a university professor teaching about human behavior and psychology.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "Zap2It", "description": "Steve Zahn plays Clark Edwards on \"Mind Games,\" whose bipolar disorder \u2014 and his affair with an undergraduate \u2014 upended his career as a university professor teaching about hum\u2026", "title": "&apos;Mind Games&apos; Steve Zahn: &apos;It&apos;s amazing how we are really just passengers&apos;", "url": "http://zap2it.com/2014/03/mind-games-steve-zahn-its-amazing-how-we-are-really-just-passengers/", "image": "http://tribzap2it.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/steve-zahn-mind-games.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://tribzap2it.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/steve-zahn-mind-games.jpg?w=240", "site": "@Zap2it", "card": "summary", "creator": "@Zap2it"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "TV Listings, TV Show Guide, Entertainment News, TV Ratings", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "application-name": "Zap2It", "google-site-verification": "8aJT9s5d7LPYKOeJ8o5_O77mMX6kYRyke1xme-QuJpA", "keywords": "tv,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WordPresscom", "published_time": "2014-03-04T20:00:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-04T20:00:00+00:00"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://zap2it.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/ad54ed4403ab81db6bc2547a51bc1fe3?s=16"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfa58\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIt\u2019s amazing how we are really just passengers in our own brains, but we think we\u2019re in control.\nWe think we\u2019re the pilots of the jumbo jet, but we\u2019re really a mouse in the belly of the plane.\u201d\nYou hear that rolling thunder, and you look out back, and there\u2019s 20 yearlings running across the field.\n\u201cYou go out, get in the truck and go home, and I become a bus driver and short-order cook and start picking up horse s*** .\n\u201cEvery window out of our house,\u201d he says, \u201cyou see horses, whether mine or the neighbors\u2019."}
