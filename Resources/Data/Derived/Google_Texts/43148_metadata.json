But manager Walt Weiss called his name in the ninth inning, telling him to get ready to pinch hit.\n\n\u201cI told him, if the game\u2019s on the line, I may use you to pinch hit, and sure enough I had to use him,\u201d Weiss said after Colorado rallied for seven runs in the ninth to beat the Giants 7-3. \u201cHe kind of got ambushed there because it happened so fast. But being the pro that he is, he took about 10 or 15 swings off the tee and then went out on deck.\u201d\n\nMorneau then sliced a two-run single to right to break a 3-3 tie and drive in the winning runs.\n\nThe veteran first baseman likely played the final game of his Rockies career. He has reached the end of a two-year contract worth $12.5 million. Although there is a $9 million mutual option pending, the chances of Morneau returning to the Rockies \u2014 even for a reworked, minimal contract \u2014 are slim. He will collect a $750,000 buyout if he doesn\u2019t re-sign.\n\n\u201cThis was a good way to finish and a nice way to feel going home,\u201d Morneau said. \u201cTo come back late like we did was great, because (AT&T) Park is a tough place to play.\u201d\n\nMorneau, 34, was out May 14 through Sept. 3 because a neck injury. Concussion symptoms landed him on the disabled list. He feared that his big-league career might be over. But since coming off the disabled list he hit safely in 11-of-15 games with a .338 average and three triples.\n\n\u201cAnybody who\u2019s had success in this game, or played for a while, doesn\u2019t just want to come back, they want to come back and play well,\u201d Morneau said. \u201cTo be able to finish on a good note was nice.\u201d\n\nDJ sits, hits .301. All-star second baseman DJ LeMahieu didn\u2019t play Sunday, thus preserving his .301 average \u2014 the first .300-plus season of his career. He also could be in line for his second consecutive Gold Glove.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I played as well defensively this year,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t really say the reason why. But I still think I helped our team defensively. I did want to come into this year and be a better hitter and a tougher out. I think I accomplished that. But I still think I can be better.\u201d\n\nCarGo gets Cain. Prior to Sunday, Rockies slugger Carlos Gonzalez had not been very good against Giants right-hander Matt Cain. But Gonzalez had two hits off Cain, including a first-inning triple that was his first extra-base hit off Cain. Gonzalez was only 4-for-45 (.089) against Cain before hitting his triple.\n\nFootnotes. Rookie catcher Tom Murphy, who injured his left shoulder diving back into second base Saturday night, underwent an MRI on his left shoulder Sunday. The MRI showed no structural damage, confirmed a mild strain and also revealed a bone bruise. Murphy will not be playing in the Arizona Fall League. \u2026 The Rockies\u2019 seven runs in the ninth marked their third-highest run total this year for an inning, and it was their most on the road since June 15, 2012, at Detroit when they plated eight runs in the 10th inning.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Justin Morneau bows out with big hit for Rockies", "title": "Justin Morneau bows out with big hit for Rockies", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/10/04/justin-morneau-bows-out-with-big-hit-for-rockies/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151004_073902_justin-morneau.jpg", "height": 506}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151004_073902_justin-morneau.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-04T19:52:53+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T04:51:12+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccb32\"", "article_summary": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Justin Morneau didn\u2019t expect to play in the Rockies\u2019 season finale Sunday afternoon.\nAlthough there is a $9 million mutual option pending, the chances of Morneau returning to the Rockies \u2014 even for a reworked, minimal contract \u2014 are slim.\nBut manager Walt Weiss called his name in the ninth inning, telling him to get ready to pinch hit.\nBut Gonzalez had two hits off Cain, including a first-inning triple that was his first extra-base hit off Cain.\nThe veteran first baseman likely played the final game of his Rockies career."}
