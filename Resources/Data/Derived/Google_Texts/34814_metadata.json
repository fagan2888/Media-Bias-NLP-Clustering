John Watkins leaves legacy: policy over politics\n\nBy Jim McConnell STAFF WRITER\n\nThe conservative wing of his own party may be cheering state Sen. John Watkins\u2019 decision to retire from the state legislature when his term ends in January 2016, but a longtime General Assembly lobbyist believes that the departure of a leader with Watkins\u2019 experience and demeanor will be a significant loss for Chesterfield.\n\n\u201cIt takes years to build that seniority and you don\u2019t replace it overnight,\u201d said Charlie Davis, a county resident who has worked in and around the General Assembly since the early 1980s.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be difficult for anyone else to gain the stature that\u2019s been amassed by Watkins because he came along at a different time. As fractured and contentious as the political process has become, it\u2019s harder for the cream to rise to the top.\u201d\n\nDavis noted that in 1981, when Watkins was first elected to represent Chesterfield, Powhatan and Colonial Heights in the Virginia House of Delegates, if someone had called Central Casting looking for an ideal state legislator, \u201cJohn Watkins would have wound up on their doorstep.\n\n\u201cThe world has changed a lot,\u201d Davis added.\n\nIndeed, by deciding to walk away after more than 30 years in public service, the 67-year-old Watkins won\u2019t have to face a likely GOP primary battle next summer for the 10th District\u2019s seat in the state senate, which he has held since 1998.\n\nThe 10th District includes all of Powhatan County and parts of both Chesterfield and the city of Richmond.\n\n\u201cOne of the things my wife said when we were making the decision not to run again was, \u2018You have to recognize the fact that you\u2019re leaving on your own terms, not somebody else\u2019s,\u201d Watkins said.\n\nGiven his stature, an interparty challenge to Watkins would have been considered folly 10 years ago. That was before Obamacare became law and a little-known college professor used it to bludgeon the second-most powerful Republican in the U.S. House of Representatives last summer.\n\nFollowing Dave Brat\u2019s stunning upset of House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, Watkins predicted that tea party conservatives within the Republican Party of Virginia would come gunning for him in 2015.\n\nLong considered one of the state GOP\u2019s most moderate members, Watkins placed himself squarely in the cross hairs of conservatives in February when he rolled out a proposal to assist thousands of Virginia\u2019s uninsured citizens.\n\nWatkins took pains to draw distinctions between Marketplace Virginia and an expansion of Medicaid, which most Republicans vehemently oppose over concerns about future costs, and its connection to federal funds made available via the Affordable Care Act.\n\nMarketplace Virginia passed the Virginia Senate with bipartisan support. But Republican leaders in the House called Watkins\u2019 proposal \u201cMedicaid expansion by another name,\u201d and it died without coming to a vote.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult today to be more concerned about policy than politics,\u201d Watkins said. \u201cI don\u2019t work like that. I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re a Republican or a Democrat; if you\u2019re only voting because of politics, you\u2019re not looking out for the people you were elected to serve.\u201d\n\nDavis, who described Watkins as \u201cabout as balanced overall\u201d as any elected official he\u2019s ever dealt with, believes that losing \u201cthe middle of the road\u201d isn\u2019t healthy in the long term for his district or the state.\n\nPerhaps Watkins\u2019 greatest legislative accomplishment came in 2012, when he spearheaded the passage of a landmark transportation bill that generates new revenue streams for road building and stands to benefit Chesterfield and other Central Virginia localities for decades to come.\n\nA successful businessman from a prominent Virginia family, Watkins is well-known for his courteous manner, a willingness to consider alternative points of view and a keen interest in solving problems.\n\nIn a statement last week, state Sen. Donald McEachin (D-Henrico) called Watkins \u201cthe true epitome of a statesman and Virginia gentleman.\n\n\u201cAlthough we do not always agree, Senator Watkins is always cordial, open to new ideas and willing to work with anyone to benefit Virginia. He refrains from knee-jerk partisan responses and vitriol,\u201d McEachin said. \u201cHis devotion to principle over partisanship, to committed and invested constituent service and to involvement in the community is an example to all of us.\u201d\n\nDonald Williams, chairman of the Chesterfield Republican Committee, described Watkins\u2019 work in the General Assembly as \u201cthoughtful and consequential.\u201d\n\n\u201cRepublicans may not be monolithic on every issue, but if you happened to disagree with John Watkins on an issue, he was never disagreeable,\u201d Williams added.\n\nWhile acknowledging it\u2019s not easy for lawmakers to carry themselves as statesmen in an era of extreme political discourse, Watkins insisted it\u2019s not impossible.\n\nHe also balked at the suggestion that his lasting legacy will be that of a man who was willing to buck his own party leadership.\n\n\u201cI have a long record, and I\u2019m sure there are things people can point to and criticize, but you\u2019re never going to make everybody happy all the time,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve done this for 34 years and I\u2018ve given it everything I have. I haven\u2019t always been right, but I always did what I thought was right for the people who put me in office.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Chesterfield Observer", "description": "The conservative wing of his own party may be cheering state Sen.
