Secretary of State Kris Kobach's successful push to require new Kansas voters to document their U.S. citizenship has spawned three lawsuits, including one from him.

Kansas is one of only four states with a proof-of-citizenship law. Its statute took effect in 2013.

Kobach has directed county election officials to cancel more than 31,000 incomplete registrations. Most are from people who've failed to document their citizenship.

Democratic attorneys filed a federal lawsuit last week against the conservative Republican secretary of state. The American Civil Liberties Union has pursued its own lawsuit in a state court for nearly two years.

Kobach and Arizona Secretary of State Ken Bennett also filed their own federal lawsuit in 2013 in a failed effort to force the federal government to help their states enforce proof-of-citizenship requirements.
