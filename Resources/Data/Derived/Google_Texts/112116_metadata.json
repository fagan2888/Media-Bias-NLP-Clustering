But as \u201cMario! Mario!\u201d filled pockets at the speedway, it was easy to wonder if he was recognized as much for what his family symbolized in failure at Indy more than his Hall of Fame career loaded with more than 100 victories.\n\nThe Andretti name has long been known at Indy as much for a curse than for championships.\n\nThe Andretti Curse is one of the most infamous curses in sports, up on the leaderboard with The Curse of The Bambino and Chicago\u2019s billy goat. The so-called curse is as much a part of Indy\u2019s lore as the singing of \u201cBack Home Again in Indiana\u201d and a pork tenderloin sandwich.\n\nMust be tough coming to Indy with that kind of legacy, right Mario?\n\n\u201cWe always look forward to it like you cannot imagine,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Andrettis brush aside talk of curses or bad luck, even though Mario\u2019s 1969 victory is the lone one for a family driver. There have been crashes, mechanical ills and just about every kind of fateful twist to keep either from winning the world\u2019s richest and most prestigious race.\n\nMario\u2019s son, Michael, had it the worst, leading 431 laps in 16 career starts without ever getting the chance to swig that championship milk.\n\nMarco Andretti, a third-generation driver, is 0 for 9 in \u201cThe Greatest Spectacle in Racing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve been blessed, man,\u201d Marco said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a ton of podiums, a ton of runner-up finishes as a family and we\u2019re not done. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re cursed.\u201d\n\nAnd Michael Andretti has reaped the spoils of team ownership, winning with Dan Wheldon (2005) and Dario Franchitti (2007). He\u2019s the reigning series owner champion after Ryan Hunter-Reay captured the checkered flag last season for Andretti Autosport.\n\nReally now, that\u2019s a curse?\n\n\u201cSounds like he\u2019s struggling,\u201d Marco cracked.\n\nWith IndyCar starved for attention outside of May for something more than misfortune, an Andretti in Victory Lane could help ignite casual fan interest. Danicamania is so 2005. How does Marcomania sound?\n\n\u201cIt would mean the world to me and the family,\u201d Marco said. \u201cI think it would be great for the fans as well to bring an Andretti back. And an American.\u201d\n\nHunter-Reay\u2019s victory was the first for an American since Sam Hornish Jr. in 2006.\n\nThe Hornish win \u2014 and Marco loss \u2014 still stings for Andretti.\n\nMarco was a rookie in 2006 and nearly needed just one chance to win the race his father couldn\u2019t during a lengthy career. He surged to the lead in the closing laps \u2014 passing his father, of all people.\n\nHornish got around Michael and quickly closed Marco\u2019s seemingly insurmountable gap. Hornish roared back on the final trip around the 2 1/2-mile oval, putting himself in perfect position off the final turn to blow by Andretti coming down the long straightaway.\n\nHornish won by a little more than a car length \u2014 just 0.064 seconds, and Marco and Michael settled for second and third.\n\nCurses that day likely only came out of their mouths for being foiled again.\n\n\u201cMy rookie year, I was criticized for being mad about second,\u201d Marco said.\n\nMichael\u2019s best finish was second. Mario, who retired after the 1994 season, won just once in 28 starts.\n\nThe Andretti curse always reminds racing aficionados of an Indy 500 joke: The four most famous words in racing aren\u2019t \u201cGentlemen, start your engines.\u201d They are \u201cAndretti is slowing down.\u201d\n\nIn 1992, Michael had the best car but fell out of contention when he inexplicably lost fuel pressure late in the race. In 1995, he bumped into a wall even though nobody was near him.\n\nJeff Andretti, Mario\u2019s youngest son, suffered a violent head-on crash in the 1992 race and broke both legs. Marco said it was hard not to think of that wreck after the frightening crash last week at practice that ended James Hinchcliffe\u2019s season.\n\n\u201cI look at the Hinch thing, I don\u2019t look at our careers as being cursed,\u201d Marco said. \u201cMy uncle took a huge hit, don\u2019t get me wrong and ended his career, but he\u2019s alive and he\u2019s with us.\u201d\n\nThe family refuses to dwell on the negatives and all the times they\u2019ve come tantalizingly close to tasting that milk.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very vested in what\u2019s going on here,\u201d Mario said. \u201cWe\u2019re honored to have that opportunity. This place has meant so much to our family in general. As far as we\u2019re concerned, it couldn\u2019t be any better.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Andretti family brushes off so-called curse at Indianapolis 500", "title": "Andretti family brushes off so-called curse at Indianapolis 500", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/05/23/andretti-family-brushes-off-so-called-curse-at-indianapolis-500/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150523_114635_marco-andretti.jpg", "height": 466}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150523_114635_marco-andretti.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-23T11:48:43+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T03:49:15+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2c12\"", "article_summary": "The Andretti Curse is one of the most infamous curses in sports, up on the leaderboard with The Curse of The Bambino and Chicago\u2019s billy goat.\nMarco Andretti, a third-generation driver, is 0 for 9 in \u201cThe Greatest Spectacle in Racing.\u201d\u201cI think we\u2019ve been blessed, man,\u201d Marco said.\n\u201cIt would mean the world to me and the family,\u201d Marco said.\nI don\u2019t think we\u2019re cursed.\u201dAnd Michael Andretti has reaped the spoils of team ownership, winning with Dan Wheldon (2005) and Dario Franchitti (2007).\nThe Andretti name has long been known at Indy as much for a curse than for championships."}
