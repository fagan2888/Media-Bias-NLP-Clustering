A CNN/WMUR poll released Thursday showed the socialist senator from Vermont just 8 points behind the former secretary of state in the New Hampshire Democratic Primary for the 2016 presidential race.

The Guardian reports:

The poll has Sanders receiving the support of 35% of likely Democratic voters while Clinton is at 43%. Vice-president Joe Biden, who has not indicated that he will mount a presidential bid, is at 8% and the former Maryland governor Martin O’Malley is at 2%.

The poll has Clinton with a far slimmer lead than she possessed at this time eight years ago. In June 2007 a CNN/WMUR poll gave Clinton a 36%-22% lead over Barack Obama in New Hampshire. Obama won the Democratic nomination. …

Clinton’s weakness in New Hampshire is a significant red flag for her campaign. New Hampshire has long been a stronghold for both Hillary and Bill Clinton. A strong performance in the state’s primary made Bill Clinton “the Comeback Kid” in 1992 and a surprise win in the 2008 primary kept Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign alive after her loss in Iowa.
