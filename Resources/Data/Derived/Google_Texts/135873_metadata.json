With two daughters under 5 and a son due in May, Liu said going uninsured was not an option.\n\nSo Liu and her husband Qing Lin, a stay-at-home dad, signed up for a benefits-rich platinum plan from Blue Shield of California. With a projected income of about $90,000 from Liu\u2019s tax preparation business, the family was eligible for a subsidy that covered a third of their nearly $1,600-a-month premium.\n\nThe plan wasn\u2019t as generous as the coverage at her accounting job, but having most of the year virtually free to spend with her family was, to her, a fair trade.\n\nThen the hassles began, said Liu, a CPA and native of Taiwan who immigrated to the United States in 1997 to attend college.\n\nAfter applying in November 2013 for the Blue Shield plan, she didn\u2019t hear back. With no response from the exchange or the insurer by Dec. 28, she panicked. She had her insurance broker submit another application.\n\nThe New Year came and went with neither a confirmation nor a bill from Covered California or Blue Shield. She had to pay for an ultrasound out-of-pocket \u2014 about $600, said Liu, who goes by Cecily in English. Fearful of giving birth without insurance, she shelled out about $1,200 for an off-exchange policy with Blue Shield that started on Feb. 1.\n\nShortly afterward, Liu received confirmation that her Covered California plan was in effect. Blue Shield agreed to apply the payment she had already made on the off-exchange plan to the exchange plan \u2014 but that took another month. The reason: Blue Shield had separate payment systems for off- and on-exchange plans.\n\n\u201cI actually visited Blue Shield in El Dorado Hills, their corporate office, to try and make them move the payments,\u201d said Liu\u2019s broker, Kevin Knauss.\n\nLiu thought her problems were behind her after the company applied the payment correctly. Then, in May, her son Nolan was born.\n\nKnauss contacted Covered California the day after his birth to add him to the family policy. When the enrollment data was submitted to Blue Shield, however, the rest of the family\u2019s coverage disappeared from the computer record. It was reinstated \u2013- except for Liu\u2019s older daughter Larissa.\n\nThat problem eventually was corrected but the policy started on the wrong date.\n\nAlthough Blue Shield covered the baby\u2019s birth, Liu and Knauss had to hector the insurer and Covered California for two months to ensure Nolan and his siblings remained properly enrolled, they said. Liu even filed a complaint with the state Department of Managed Health Care.\n\n\u201cNo one was willing to take responsibility. I told them\u2026 \u2018You took my money and ran,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nIn late September, Knauss was checking online and noticed the family\u2019s coverage seemed to have disappeared again.\n\nAfter another round of calls they were back in the system. But all the stress resurfaced in November when the pediatrician\u2019s office called to say coverage couldn\u2019t be verified for her younger daughter Fiona\u2019s visit back in July.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like history is repeating,\u201d said an exasperated Liu, who fielded several similar calls in the summer, when she was trying to sign up her son. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d\n\n\u2018We can do better\u2019\n\nNeither Covered California nor Blue Shield would comment specifically on Liu\u2019s case. But they and consumer advocates both underscored the need to improve \u201cthe customer experience.\u201d\n\nCovered California is \u201cgoing to have to not just promise but provide a better experience for people in renewing and signing up for coverage,\u201d said Anthony Wright, executive director of Health Access California, an advocacy group.\n\nDespite glitches, Covered California\u2019s first enrollment period, which started in October 2013, was a success compared to the rollout of its federal counterpart operating in 36 states, healthcare.gov.\n\nEnrollment this year began on Nov. 15 and runs until Feb. 15, and California\u2019s exchange appears to be going more smoothly. In the first month, 144,178 people selected a health plan, nearly a third more than signed up in the first month in 2013, according to Covered California.\n\nExchange officials say they spent the summer making improvements, bolstering technological infrastructure and adding staff.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure there are people who have had a negative experience that won\u2019t come back,\u201d said Roy Kennedy, a spokesman. \u201cWe ask that they come back and let us try to make it up to them. We know that we can do better.\u201d\n\nA Blue Shield spokesman said in an email that during the early implementation of the health reform law, \u201csome customers did not experience the level of service they deserve.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have and will continue to work closely with Covered California and our vendors to address these issues and streamline the process in 2015 and beyond,\u201d said the spokesman, Sean Barry.\n\nA Cautious Decision\n\nFor months, Liu went back and forth about whether to re-enroll.\n\nShe found herself thinking, \u201cIt\u2019s just too much work. I don\u2019t have time for that.\u201d\n\nIf she took no action, she and her family would be automatically re-enrolled in their Blue Shield platinum policy. The pre-subsidy premium would be $1,699 a month, a $116 hike.\n\nDays before the Dec. 21 deadline for coverage beginning in the New Year, Liu cautiously decided to give Covered California another try. Instead of a platinum plan, she picked a slightly less rich gold one because she doesn\u2019t expect to need as much care as this year when she had the baby. She will pay $1,482\u2014or $949 with the tax credit.\n\nLiu\u2019s hoping the switch proceeds without difficulties but if the service isn\u2019t substantially better, she\u2019s buying private insurance off exchange next time.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to deal with that headache again,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Richmond family spends 2014 trying to get their coverage sorted out.
