You would think, after he unilaterally suspended the employer mandate in ObamaCare, ordered not one but two enormous amnesties for illegals, and, oh yeah, launched multiple wars without seeking Congress\u2019s authorization, that Democrats would tolerate or even expect that Boehner might not be a stickler about observing traditional courtesies between the branches. Turns out they\u2019re quite surprised by his affront. Via Breitbart, watch below as Jen Psaki calls it an \u201cepisode of the bizarre.\u201d Obama\u2019s handing out work permits to people who are here illegally under U.S. law and Boehner\u2019s invite is \u201cbizarre\u201d?\n\nAm I awake?\n\nHe didn\u2019t consult with the White House before extending the invitation, and administration officials are not happy. Press secretary Josh Earnest said Wednesday afternoon that Boehner\u2019s invitation is a breach of normal diplomatic protocol. Typically, a nation\u2019s leader would contact the White House before planning a visit to the United States, he said. The White House heard about the invite from Boehner\u2019s office, not from the Israelis. According to pool reports, Earnest called the invite \u201cinteresting,\u201d and when asked if the White House was annoyed because Boehner did not reach out first, he said, \u201cNo.\u201d\u2026 However, this isn\u2019t the first time a House speaker has reached out to a world leader despite a White House request to stay back. In April 2007, then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi traveled to Syria to meet with President Bashar al-Assad despite the Bush administration\u2019s objections. Pelosi wanted to start a dialogue with Syria, as diplomatic relations had broken down in the 1990s; President George W. Bush rejected such negotiation, saying, \u201cSending delegations doesn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of Pelosi, she\u2019s mad at Boehner today too \u2014 not for breaking with White House protocol but for breaking with protocol within Congress.\n\n\u201cWhen I was \u2014 also when I was minority leader and became one of the four leaders, it was clear always that if we wanted \u2014 if we had a suggestion about a head of state to come, that it was something that had to \u2014 you passed around the four top leaders,\u201d Pelosi told reporters at a press conference today\u2026 Pelosi said Boehner has \u201cawesome power\u201d in his position as speaker, but \u201cthat power is not to be squandered.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s hubris to say, you know, \u2018I rule; I\u2019ll decide.\u2019 And without any sensitivity to the fact that an [Israeli] election is taking two weeks \u2014 and within two weeks, the invitation I get is for the 3rd of March and the election is the \u2014 what? \u2014 the 17th, something like that. And also the fact that what is the purpose of it. Is the purpose to come and talk about sanctions? To talk about a policy in opposition to the policy that our president has just put forth in his State of the Union address and that has been in operation for many months?\u201d\n\nYeah, again, it\u2019s awfully late in the day to be complaining about hubris and comity inside Congress. The only reason Obama gets away with his far more hubristic encroachments on legislative power is because congressional Democrats are happy to back him up. For Pelosi\u2019s caucus, partisan interests trump constitutional and institutional ones. Boehner deciding not to run an invite past her before announcing it is the mildest possible rebuke to that sort of betrayal. And that\u2019s just the House: You know all about how Harry Reid locked Republicans out of the amendment process in the Senate, then turned around and blew up their filibuster for presidential appointees. There is no \u201cprotocol\u201d after partisan aggression like that. I\u2019m amazed Pelosi could suggest there is with a straight face.\n\nLet\u2019s hope the Netanyahu invitation is just the first of many, then. One minor but symbolic way that Boehner can strike back at Obama\u2019s executive overreach is to invite various western leaders to speak whose own policies align more with Congress\u2019s than the White House\u2019s. First invitee, obviously, should be Stephen Harper to discuss the benefits of building the Keystone pipeline. Next invite goes to French prime minister Manuel Valls, who declared war on an enemy that our own leaders are now afraid to name. Third invite could go to Iraqi prime minister Haider al-Abadi, who\u2019ll have an interesting view, I\u2019ll bet, on whether Obama was right in the SOTU that we\u2019re making gains against ISIS in Syria. If Boehner can\u2019t stop Obama from blowing up separation of powers, he could at least invite foreign dignitaries to reality-check him.\n\nOh, incidentally, Obama\u2019s refusing to meet with Netanyahu during his visit, ostensibly for the same reason Pelosi gave, i.e. that a presidential audience so soon before Israel\u2019s elections might affect the outcome. Laying aside the fact that, as Noah says, being shunned by O is far more likely to help Netanyahu back home than doing a photo op with him would be, where did they get the idea that we don\u2019t meddle in Israel\u2019s elections? We do it all the time.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Prerogatives.", "title": "Democrats whine: Boehner broke with protocol by inviting Netanyahu without telling Obama first", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2015/01/22/democrats-whine-boehner-broke-with-protocol-by-inviting-netanyahu-without-telling-obama-first/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@allahpundit"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-22T19:41:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-22T21:36:17+00:00"}, "keywords": "address, boehner, Congress, Israel, netanyahu, Obama, protocol, White House,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca422\"", "article_summary": "He didn\u2019t consult with the White House before extending the invitation, and administration officials are not happy.\nTypically, a nation\u2019s leader would contact the White House before planning a visit to the United States, he said.\nThe White House heard about the invite from Boehner\u2019s office, not from the Israelis.\nIf Boehner can\u2019t stop Obama from blowing up separation of powers, he could at least invite foreign dignitaries to reality-check him.\nOh, incidentally, Obama\u2019s refusing to meet with Netanyahu during his visit, ostensibly for the same reason Pelosi gave, i.e."}
