Much of Monday will be dry, but when snow falls Monday night into Tuesday the winds will increase to create blizzard conditions.

A Blizzard Watch is in effect for central and east central South Dakota and western Minnesota late Monday night into Tuesday afternoon. Also, a Winter Storm Watch is in effect for south central and southwest South Dakota for late Monday night through Tuesday morning.

Clouds will slowly increase through the day on Monday and highs will return to the thirties and forties. Winds will increase from the south and average fifteen to twenty-five miles per hour. The strong winds will be the result of a strengthening storm system to our south that will bring a good chance for accumulating snow to southern and southeast KELOLAND. The snow will most likely start after sunset on Monday in southwest and south central South Dakota and move east Monday night into Tuesday.

Winds will change to the northwest and increase on Tuesday. Wind speeds will average twenty to forty miles per hour with gusts over forty. The strong winds will combine with the new snow to create blizzard conditions from central South Dakota to western Minnesota.

As of now, snow amounts of two to four inches will be possible in southeast South Dakota, extreme northwest Iowa, and southwest Minnesota. Expect a slow commute Tuesday morning and use caution when driving Monday night through Tuesday afternoon.

After the snow leaves, temperatures will fall to the single digits and teens for highs on Wednesday. The cold air will not last long as warmer weather will be here for the weekend.

Thatâ€™s when highs will return to the 30s and 40s on Saturday with slightly warmer temperatures on Sunday.
