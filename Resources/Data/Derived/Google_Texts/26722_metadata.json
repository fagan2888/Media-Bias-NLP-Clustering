Northwestern has 1,601, 13 times as many. KishHealth's $221.7 million in annual revenue amounts to just 6 percent of Northwestern's $3.71 billion.\n\nThe pairing might not seem to give Northwestern much, but in the evolving world of hospital economics, it makes sense, experts say. \u201cI think it's a market share issue, and it's evidence of the growing radius of geography that these places need to feed,\u201d says Jim Unland, president of Chicago-based consultancy Health Capital Group.\n\nAdding KishHealth to Northwestern, Advocate or any other system creates a fresh pipeline of patients to the bigger facilities. For Northwestern in particular, a deal with KishHealth would help the Streeterville-based academic medical center offset potential losses closer to home.\n\nAdvocate, the largest health system in Illinois, with 12 hospitals, plans to merge with NorthShore University HealthSystem, a fierce Northwestern rival with four hospitals in the northern suburbs. Lake Forest Hospital, which became part of Northwestern in 2010, is just six miles from NorthShore's Highland Park Hospital.\n\nBringing KishHealth on board also would help protect Cadence Health, which joined Northwestern last year and sits between DeKalb and downtown Chicago, from losing patients to Advocate, experts say.\n\nThe potential pairing reflects how few stand-alone or small health systems are left in the Chicago area that want to be acquired. It also highlights how academic medical centers and large health systems increasingly are bringing smaller systems into their networks to create a strong referral base and, by extension, gain market share and better coordinate care among large groups of patients, a hallmark of federal health reform.\n\nKEPT WITHIN SYSTEMS\n\nRush Health is among the local networks using this model; its Rush University Medical Center on the Near West Side is the anchor for three smaller, suburban hospitals. \u201cWe want to make sure patients are kept within systems as much as possible because that's going to be the only way to manage populations of patients in a collaborative and coordinated way,\u201d Rush Health President and CEO Brent Estes says.\n\nNorthwestern and KishHealth announced in late May that they had signed a letter of intent to explore an affiliation. KishHealth likely would become a part of Northwestern, a Northwestern spokesman said at the time. He declines to comment further.\n\nCommunity-focused KishHealth's decision to seek a partner was fueled by changes under the Affordable Care Act, Mike Kokott, a KishHealth assistant vice president, told Crain's last month.\n\nUnder Obamacare, health systems and physicians are paid by insurers to keep patients healthy and away from expensive hospital stays and unnecessary procedures. Otherwise, they could take a financial hit. The effort involves coordinating patient care, which is expensive and taxing. That's because it often requires investing in electronic medical records systems and hiring more employees to keep close tabs on patients, particularly those with chronic and costly conditions like diabetes and heart disease.\n\nWith few specialty services at KishHealth, the system was losing patients who needed a higher level of care. That made coordinating their care and making sure they returned to KishHealth for routine doctor visits tough.\n\nKokott declines to comment on prospective suitors beyond Northwestern. But Advocate spokesman Vince Pierri confirms that the Downers Grove-based health system responded to KishHealth's request for proposal. \u201cWe have the utmost respect for KishHealth and their leadership team,\u201d Pierri says in a statement. \u201cGiven their existing clinical relationship with Cadence, which recently became a part of Northwestern, we are not surprised with their decision.\u201d\n\nPhysicians at Cadence, which has hospitals in west suburban Winfield and Geneva, also work at KishHealth facilities.\n\nFor KishHealth, Advocate would have brought deep pockets, even deeper than affluent Northwestern. Advocate had $5.23 billion in total 2014 revenue. KishHealth also would have gained access to a hospital network with thousands of physicians and specialists.\n\nBut with Northwestern, KishHealth gets the branding power of a major academic medical center and the specialists who work there, and that, apparently, was enough.", "article_metadata": {"taxo_Sections": "News", "msapplication-TileImage": "/assets/icons/mstile-144x144.png", "byline": "Kristen Schorsch", "timeCrawled": "20160526_03:27:29", "categoryName": "MAG - Issue News", "title": "Why Northwestern Memorial HealthCare sees growth from KishHealth in DeKalb", "taxo_Industries": "Hospitals", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=571426684", "twitter": {"image": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/images/logo-square-200x200.png", "site": "@CrainsChicago", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Why Northwestern Memorial HealthCare sees growth from KishHealth in DeKalb"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#2d89ef", "fb": {"admins": 100001125868754}, "summary": "When Northwestern Memorial HealthCare beat out Advocate Health Care for the chance to scoop up far west suburban KishHealth, it signaled the lengths dominant health systems are willing to go to bulk up even more.", "og": {"site_name": "Crain's Chicago Business", "description": "When Northwestern Memorial HealthCare beat out Advocate Health Care for the chance to scoop up far west suburban KishHealth, it signaled the lengths dominant health systems are willing to go to bulk up even more.", "title": "Can a tiny health care chain in DeKalb really help Northwestern Medicine?", "url": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20150606/ISSUE01/306069992/can-a-tiny-health-care-chain-in-dekalb-really-help-northwestern-medicine", "image": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/images/logo-square-200x200.png", "type": "article"}, "published_at": "2015-6-6", "url": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article//ISSUE01/306069992", "content_type": "article", "taxo_Companies": "Rush University Medical Center", "google-site-verification": "0QcjJi4OGS9bKu4FBKK58V93fKv0WYCQb7IFbmjATew", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui", "description": "Visit Crain's Chicago Business for complete business news and analysis including healthcare, real estate, manufacturing, government, sports and more."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda307\"", "article_summary": "Adding KishHealth to Northwestern, Advocate or any other system creates a fresh pipeline of patients to the bigger facilities.\nWhen Northwestern Memorial HealthCare beat out Advocate Health Care for the chance to scoop up far west suburban KishHealth System, it signaled the lengths dominant health systems are willing to go to bulk up even more.\nFor KishHealth, Advocate would have brought deep pockets, even deeper than affluent Northwestern.\nBut with Northwestern, KishHealth gets the branding power of a major academic medical center and the specialists who work there, and that, apparently, was enough.\nThe potential pairing reflects how few stand-alone or small health systems are left in the Chicago area that want to be acquired."}
