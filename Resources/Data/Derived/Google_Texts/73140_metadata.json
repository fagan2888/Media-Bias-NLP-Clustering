In a state like Alabama, where talk of Obamacare is highly politicized and a single insurance company holds a virtual monopoly over the region, clear-cut information about the healthcare exchanges can be even harder to find.\n\nOne group, however, is attempting to cut through all the political rhetoric and technicalities surrounding the Affordable Care Act. Founded on the belief that \u201chealthcare is about people, not politics,\u201d Bama Covered, a nonprofit grassroots education initiative, is recruiting college students from across the state to act as conduits of non-partisan healthcare information within their own communities.\n\nFounded by Alabama native and UAB alumnus Josh Carpenter and Harvard graduate Dan Liss, Bama Covered has already recruited, trained, and implemented several hundred volunteers from dozens of college campuses across the state. The organization\u2019s ultimate goal, however, is to mobilize 1,000 students and to jumpstart a total of 100,000 conversations concerning healthcare \u2013 all before the March 31 deadline.\n\nIn a recent interview with Weld, co-founder Josh Carpenter says that these numbers are ambitious, but well within reach.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m getting reports from people from all across the state \u2013 Mobile, Tuskagee, Huntsville,\u201d says Carpenter. \u201cWhen we hatched this idea, 1,000 [volunteers] seemed like a pie in the sky \u2014 the ideal, but not necessarily feasible. It\u2019s just really fantastic to see us approach that number here in February.\u201d\n\nCarpenter, a 26-year-old former Rhodes Scholar and current graduate student at Oxford University, says the idea for the organization was \u201cborn out of frustration\u201d after hearing story after story of confusion and frustration surrounding the healthcare system. As a native of Florence, Alabama and a former teacher in Alabama\u2019s Black Belt, he felt that many residents wanted practical answers about how to approach their healthcare options, but didn\u2019t know where to look.\n\n\u201cThis whole [healthcare] thing has been about politics for a long time, and it really should be about families making the best decision for themselves about healthcare,\u201d Carpenter says. \u201cOur goal is to provide a unique source of reliable and accurate information to families so that they can make the decisions for themselves.\u201d\n\nUnder Liss and Carpenter\u2019s leadership, Bama Covered has established an impressive volunteer board of directors that includes a former Alabama Supreme Court justice, a university president and a university dean of public health. Carpenter says that the organization\u2019s engine, however, lies in its student recruits.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a very decentralized organization that puts the power into the hands of the students,\u201d says Carpenter. \u201cTruly, we started in January and these students are acting like they\u2019ve been doing this for years. They\u2019re out and about making connections everywhere.\u201d\n\nBama Covered offers three ways to volunteer, with positions varying according to the amount of training and effort the student is willing to undergo. At the most basic level, the student is given enough resources and information to actively go out and connect friends and family members with healthcare information. Other volunteer positions require certified training from the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nAt the more administrative level, student \u201cgroup-captains\u201d at each university help to match fellow volunteers with opportunities to speak to their community, such as setting up booths at local events around town or speaking to church congregations.\n\nAccording to Carpenter, volunteers seem to be attracted to the group for a variety of reasons. Many of the student recruits are looking to go into public health or medical careers, and are thus appreciative of the opportunity to actually implement their education into their own communities. Other students, though, were pushed into joining the organization after undergoing their own healthcare horror stories.\n\nOne volunteer remembers having insurance at 18, and dreading his upcoming 19th birthday \u2013 when he would be kicked off of his All Kids insurance plan. Another volunteer recalls sitting in a waiting room after getting a cancer screening and wondering how she would find the money to pay for it.\n\nAshleigh Staples, a UAB political science major and co-team captain at Bama Covered, joined because of the group\u2019s apolitical appeal. She and other volunteers have gone to several libraries and churches in order to speak to residents, and she\u2019s been most surprised by what she calls the \u201cmisinformation that\u2019s out there.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome people thought that the deadline [for enrollment] didn\u2019t apply to them, that the whole state of Alabama was opting out of the Affordable Care Act,\u201d says Staples. \u201cA few people think that BlueCross-Blue Shield is the only insurance provider, which has kind of been an issue. They think that there\u2019s only one option, so they don\u2019t see why there\u2019s any point in us talking to them.\u201d\n\nStaples says that most people are grateful for the information\u00ad \u2013 often they\u2019re worried about an uninsured family member, but they don\u2019t trust the official website for information. She\u2019s in the process of being certified so that she can work with actual hospitals and healthcare organizations to walk people through their healthcare options.\n\nAs of right now, the organization\u2019s status after the March 31 deadline is undetermined. Carpenter says that Bama Covered is an official Alabama nonprofit group, but its forecast for the future is still up for grabs.\n\n\u201cI thought if we can build a platform that could allow students to participate actively in their democracy in a way that\u2019s meaningful with people, then they\u2019ll jump on it,\u201d he says. \u201cCome April 1, there\u2019s a lot of pathways we could take. Our goal, right now is to be as effective as possible in getting the message out.\u201d\n\nIf you would like to receive more information regarding your healthcare options or would like to volunteer with Bama Covered, visit bamacovered.org or contact Josh Carpenter at josh@bamacovered.org.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Weld for Birmingham", "description": "Nonprofit Bama Covered fights misinformation and aids those in need.", "title": "Helping Alabamians get health insurance", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 5760, "identifier": "http://weldbham.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/BamaCovered-PTK-Training-Day-1.jpg", "height": 3840}, "url": "http://weldbham.com/blog/2014/02/25/helping-alabamians-get-health-insurance/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 199569796846147}, "template": "WeldBham 1.0", "google-site-verification": "878969361de6ef4b", "article": {"section": "News & Views", "tag": "uab hospital", "published_time": "2014-02-25T17:21:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-25T17:21:13+00:00", "author": "http://weldbham.com/blog/author/hollieparrish/"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf355\"", "article_summary": "Ashleigh Staples, a UAB political science major and co-team captain at Bama Covered, joined because of the group\u2019s apolitical appeal.\nAccording to Carpenter, volunteers seem to be attracted to the group for a variety of reasons.\nNonprofit Bama Covered fights misinformation and aids those in need.\nCarpenter says that Bama Covered is an official Alabama nonprofit group, but its forecast for the future is still up for grabs.\n\u201cThis whole [healthcare] thing has been about politics for a long time, and it really should be about families making the best decision for themselves about healthcare,\u201d Carpenter says."}
