(Paul White/AP)\n\nSo, should we bomb Syria?\n\nAfter Afghanistan, after the drones in Pakistan, after Libya, after Iraq, after \u2026 after what?\n\nI\u2019ve lived through so many American bombings, they glob together and become indistinct. We were still bombing Korea when I was born, and I came of age as we bombed Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos. I witnessed the Cuban Missile crisis and the armament frenzy of the Cold War when nuclear bombs held us hostage to extinction. We were, as the talking heads liked to say, part of \u201cMutually Assured Destruction\u201d \u2014 an idea bizarre enough that even its acronym noted its insanity; an idea, we must remember, that is still quietly in play.\n\nThe word \u201cbomb\u201d is so bland, it\u2019s easy to gloss over the ruin and blood of those who bear its impact.\n\nThe word \u201cbomb\u201d is so bland, it\u2019s easy to gloss over the ruin and blood of those who bear its impact. Few horrors equal it. And, in truth, the history of bombing is arguably as atrocious as the evil it seeks to halt. Don\u2019t take my word, but go look at the way the Italians practiced on the Libyans, the British on the Abyssinians, and how the Nazis readied themselves to conquer the world by raining bombs upon the Spanish during the Spanish Civil War. (Picasso gave us \u201cGuernica\u201d to help us recollect.) Consider how the United States ended the Second \u201cgood\u201d World War by dropping more tons of ordnance than the most sympathetic historians can possibly justify. (Perhaps it\u2019s time to collectively revisit Kurt Vonnegut\u2019s autobiographical novel \u201cSlaughterhouse-Five,\u201d in which he recounted the inferno created by the Allied fire-bombing that destroyed Dresden. He was a prisoner of war there, and barely lived to tell the tale.)\n\nStill, when we see people being exterminated by their own leaders, we know impassivity is not a righteous path. What if, to raise a famous example, Roosevelt had immediately bombed the rails to Auschwitz and Dachau?\n\nOr, changing perspectives for a moment, what if a powerful and enlightened nation had bombed us as we perpetrated atrocities against our own? Bombed Andrew Jackson before he slaughtered Creek Indians at Horseshoe Bend in 1814? Bombed the great slave markets in Charleston, and all the builders of the ships that carried and killed millions of African slaves during the middle passage? Would we have saved countless lives, and been spared living with the legacies of a genocide and a terrible civil war?\n\nPerhaps life only offers us the choice of bomb or be bombed.\n\nBut, who am I to grouse against our actions? I have lived 61-years without having to think for a moment about my country being occupied, my children slaughtered. Talk about privilege. Perhaps life only offers us the choice of bomb or be bombed. Perhaps gratitude is the only proper course \u2014 even as I have carried so many signs and marched so many times to attempt to halt awful wars.\n\nAnd I am deeply grateful for my safety; for having been spared the Gulag under Stalin, or re-education under Mao. Yet, my heart aches, my mind rebels, and my soul feels weary, and I have to ask, is violence the only possible collective way? Sword against sword \u2014 from the dawn of time to its demise? Is diplomacy so ineffectual? Mass sentiment so feeble? Our human nature so hard-wired? Will we never stop dominating and killing?\n\nI have no answer, but let us not forsake the dignity of the question.", "article_metadata": {"description": "When the only solution is arguably as atrocious as the evil it seeks to halt.", "og": {"site_name": "cognoscenti", "description": "When the only solution is arguably as atrocious as the evil it seeks to halt.", "title": "The Bomb: No Easy Answers, So Let\u2019s Keep Asking The Question", "url": "http://cognoscenti.wbur.org/2013/09/09/syria-janna-malamud-smith", "image": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/16/files/2013/09/0906_guernica_cog-592x323.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://cognoscenti.wbur.org/2013/09/09/syria-janna-malamud-smith", "image": "//s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/16/files/2013/09/0906_guernica_cog-592x323.jpg", "site": "@cogwbur", "card": "summary", "title": "The Bomb: No Easy Answers, So Let's Keep Asking The Question"}, "DC.date.issued": "2013-09-09", "fb": {"admins": 1549080028, "app_id": 134067973330252}, "msvalidate.01": "D02D46BAEDB3F81FC1B1DE2A8CB69551"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2357\"", "article_summary": "The word \u201cbomb\u201d is so bland, it\u2019s easy to gloss over the ruin and blood of those who bear its impact.\nConsider how the United States ended the Second \u201cgood\u201d World War by dropping more tons of ordnance than the most sympathetic historians can possibly justify.\nWe were still bombing Korea when I was born, and I came of age as we bombed Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos.\nSword against sword \u2014 from the dawn of time to its demise?\nI witnessed the Cuban Missile crisis and the armament frenzy of the Cold War when nuclear bombs held us hostage to extinction."}
