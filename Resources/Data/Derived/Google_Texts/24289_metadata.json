A beautiful marble center aisle leads to an altar, which contains the holy book, or Guru Granth Sahib. This is one of the biggest gurdwaras in the San Francisco Bay Area -- every Sunday, around 3,000 people come to worship, eat and find fellowship.Outside the hall, it\u2019s bustling. Kids laugh and play, friends and family chat while they stand in line for free vegetarian food, cars stream through the parking lot, and right in front of the main building, at a folding table covered with flyers, Jagmeet Kaur and Davinder Kaur are fielding some questions in Punjabi about the Covered California health insurance exchange.Jagmeet and Davinder, who are not related, volunteer with Community Ambassadors for Seniors (CAPS), a city initiative to help seniors access services like health care and food assistance. The gentleman they\u2019re speaking with is a recent immigrant from India and doesn\u2019t know what government benefits he and his wife are eligible for.Unlike other city-based programs, CAPS doesn\u2019t wait for seniors to come to them. Instead, the organization sends volunteers out into their communities. The idea is to serve as a bridge between formal social services and faith-based cultural communities.This is a big deal in Fremont, where 40 years of major demographic shifts have forced the city to reevaluate how it does things.In 1970, the city was nearly all white. But these days there\u2019s no ethnic majority, almost half the population is foreign-born, and nearly two-thirds of households speak a language other than English.Studies have shown that immigrant elders have a harder time than their native-born counterparts in accessing benefits and services. \u201cSo that's where the gurdwara plays a great role,\u201d says Kashmir Singh, also a CAPS ambassador at Gurdwara Sahib Fremont.\u201cThe seniors who cannot actually go to certain places to get help because of [lack of a] ride, or the language, they can come here,\u201d says Singh. \u201cThey can talk to people with their own language, and they feel confident talking to their own community member.\u201dAsha Chandra, the CAPS program coordinator, says officials didn\u2019t come up with this idea on their own. In 2005, the city conducted a series of focus groups in nine different languages.\u201cWe brought the leaders of each of these ethnic and faith-based organizations together \u2026 to a round table,\u201d says Chandra. \u201cWe asked them, if we were to come up with a program where we could work with seniors in your own individual communities, what would that model look like?\u201dAnswers varied, but there was an overarching theme: Everyone thought services should be available where seniors already congregate. So the city developed CAPS from the bottom up, with cultural and religious organizations as partners.CAPS ambassadors -- regular people, not social workers -- go through a 40-hour training that covers a broad range of services and resources, as well as transportation, nutrition, housing options, legal assistance, and the ins and outs of governments benefits.But having the right information is only the first step. The critical second step is getting that information to the people who need it -- which means enlisting their neighbors.CAPS ambassador Cordelia Shieh and her client, Mrs. Jin, aren\u2019t literally neighbors, but they do cross paths: Shieh\u2019s church is just down the street from Jin\u2019s subsidized senior apartment complex in Fremont.The two are meeting in a common room at the apartment complex to discuss getting Jin, 64, enrolled in health care through the Affordable Care Act. Jin moved to the United States from Shanghai in 2008, but never got health insurance. She says it\u2019s a great relief to know she\u2019s eligible now, since for years she lived with constant anxiety about her health.\u201cFrankly, I\u2019m not ashamed to tell you, I\u2019m always worried, always being careful because I can\u2019t afford to get sick,\u201d Jin says in Mandarin. \u201cI say to myself, I\u2019m going to try my best not to be sick, and that\u2019s all I can do.\u201dShieh is also trying to get Jin enrolled in CalFresh, or the food stamp program, through a phone interview. Jin has taken English classes before -- she\u2019s already passed her citizenship test -- but she still doesn\u2019t feel fully confident, especially about making phone calls. So Shieh pulls out her cellphone and puts it on speakerphone, so they can go through the call together.Shieh has been working with Mrs. Jin for about a year now, helping to explain senior housing applications and arranging health insurance for Jin\u2019s husband, who has complications following a stroke. But the advice and help flow both ways, as Jin presses Shieh to drink the bottle of water she\u2019s brought for her.\u201cHe shui! Drink more water! It\u2019s good for you! Good for your skin. I drink a lot of water at home,\u201d she admonishes Shieh with a smile.\u201cThere's the formal system of medical care, or the hospitals. But it's really that informal system: the neighbors, who you connect with, who you go to,\u201d says CAPS administrator Karen Grimsich.She says the program is purposely non-bureaucratic; the point is to take it down to a person-to-person level, building on relationships or connections that already exist.\u201cI think what's really gotten me very excited is how the community can be the solution,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd how we often don't phrase social services in that way.\u201dThe CAPS program now has over 60 active ambassadors, with more joining every year.After the initial training, ambassadors continue to meet periodically to learn about additional resources, support each others\u2019 issues, and also get to know each other better.Karen Grimsich says it\u2019s a wonderfully unexpected benefit that the program connects the ambassadors themselves on a personal level. CAPS has created bridges across ethnic communities as well as within them.\u201cI mean, isn\u2019t that the wish we have in our world?\u201d she asks. \u201cThat there's respect and understanding, and room for all different people and cultures?\u201dJen Chien produced this story for KALW Public Radio in San Francisco through a fellowship from New America Media and the Gerontological Society of America, supported by AARP.
