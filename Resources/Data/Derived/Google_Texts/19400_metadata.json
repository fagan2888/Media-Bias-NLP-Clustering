And I intend to exercise those responsibilities.\"\n\n(Writing by Doina Chiacu; Editing by Jim Loney and Marguerita Choy)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Reuters Editorial", "Author": "Reuters Editorial", "DCSext.PageNumber": 1, "twitter": {"description": "Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said China's continued economic growth will require building trust, not tensions, with other countries, according to an interview broadcast on Sunday.", "title": "Japan's Abe says China's prosperity rests on trust, not tensions", "image": "http://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20140126&t=2&i=832813476&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=CBREA0P1FDK00", "creator": "@Reuters", "site": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "DCSext.rChannel": "Article -
