In addition, the bill would repeal many major parts of the Obamacare law, including the program that provides taxpayer subsidies to about 1,000 health plans that pay for elective abortions.\n\nMany of the hundreds of thousands who walk in the annual March for Life in Washington D.C. on Friday will be also visiting their representatives to encourage them to vote to override Obama\u2019s veto. But we still very much need your voice to add to the cry to cut Planned Parenthood\u2019s funding and to repeal anti-life provisions of Obamacare.\n\nPlease click here to view our important Call Alert at National Right to Life\u2019s Legislative Action Center.
