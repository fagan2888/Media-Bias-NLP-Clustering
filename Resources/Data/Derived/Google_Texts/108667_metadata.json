Culbert was in jail for capital murder charges with his fellow cellmate and escapee, Demarcus Woodard. Gordon was incarcerated for armed robbery charges.\n\nGordon was taken into custody Saturday night around 7 p.m. in the parking lot of a movie theater in Tuscaloosa. He was in a vehicle with two other people when he was surrounded by U.S. Marshals and local law enforcement with guns drawn.\n\n\u201cAs the United States Marshal teams made their approach to arrest him, he had his hands up and was arrested without incident,\u201d U.S. Marshal Supervisor Inspector Chad Hunt says.\n\nSheriff Tom Abate says they thought the two people with Gordon were the other inmates, but that turned out not to be the case. This morning authorities tracked down Culbert who was hiding at his grandmother\u2019s house in Bellamy, Ala.\n\n\u201cWe arrested him at his family\u2019s house. Again, there was no incident whatsoever,\" Hunt says. \"We, the teams of the United States Marshals, and our task force officers made the apprehension.\u201d\n\nNow the focus turns to Woodard, who was in for capital murder and is still somewhere out there. Sheriff Tom Abate, along with U.S. Marshals, say they are closing in.\n\n\u201cWe've been receiving information as we go along. It\u2019s very fluid at this time. We were hoping to have him under arrest at the time of this briefing. That\u2019s why we\u2019re a little late. Things are still happening,\u201d Sheriff Tom Abate explains. \u201cI really believe he has nothing to lose. I tell the public not to take any chances with him. If he is spotted, please contact your local agency immediately, 911, or however. We do not take this individual lightly.\u201d\n\nPolice say information from the community and a joint effort from a multitude of law enforcement agencies helped lead to the apprehension of two dangerous individuals.\n\n\u201cWe could not do this without the citizens' help - an outpouring support from citizens providing tips. These tips have led to the arrest of the two individuals we have in custody,\u201d Hunt says.\n\nThe sheriff wants anyone with any information on Demarcus Woodard to contact local police. U.S. Marshals are offering a reward of up to $5,000. Call 1(877)WANTED2 if you have any information.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Two inmates are back in custody and one is at large.
