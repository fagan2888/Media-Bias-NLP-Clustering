Most have had coverage for a year or more, but responded inadequately to a letter requesting verification, reported The Wall Street Journal.\n\nAnother 110,000 who did not respond to the letter at all were dropped from coverage in September.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether the IRS is making any attempt to recover the lost tax dollars, and it did not respond to a WSJ request for comment.\n\nAn Obamacare provision prohibits illegal aliens from enrolling, but almost a million people signed up in 2014 with questionable legal status. Critics say technical problems with Healthcare.gov let people slip through the cracks, but immigration activists argue officials made it unclear how and when enrollees should verify their status.\n\nOfficials also said Wednesday nearly 7.75 million people have enrolled in 2015 plans through HealthCare.gov.\n\n\u201cGo to HealthCare.gov for life \u2014 a healthier life \u2014 liberty, freedom to pursue your happiness,\u201d House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said Thursday. \u201cWe are very proud of the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nFollow Rachel on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
