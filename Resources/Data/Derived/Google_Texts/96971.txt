High-schoolers and their parents have to weigh dozens of factors when selecting which of America's 4,726 institutions of higher learning they'd like to attend. There are the obvious academic considerations: the size of the classes, the average SAT score of the students, the average salary of graduating seniors. The overall culture of the school is clearly a factor too, as are the location, school size and costs.

Other important factors often get overlooked, though - like the food. Few superhuman students can easily balance a class schedule, extracurriculars and cook for themselves, meaning most will probably be consigned to eating the campus food for four years. You know what that means: grumpy cafeteria workers, indiscernable slop and plastic trays.

Or does it? Campus dining has seen something of a renaissance lately, as college administrators come to realize that attractive food options can be a sizable draw for new students. After all, it's hard to focus during an all-nighter if you're dealing with constant stomach pangs.

Thankfully, the folks at Niche, a handy site that rates colleges based on a whole array of factors, put together a list of the colleges with the best on-campus dining experiences. They looked at survey responses from students and alumni as well as Department of Education data on meal plan costs. We've collected their top 20 schools here, and wound up feeling very, very hungry in the process.
