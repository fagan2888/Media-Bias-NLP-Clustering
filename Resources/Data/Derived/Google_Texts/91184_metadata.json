People get closer to qualifying for Medicaid as annual income drops.\n\nMarillac hired new physicians and announced that the clinic was accepting new patients, offering comprehensive primary and preventative care from birth to death, or before in the case of prenatal patients.\n\nPrior to 2015, Marillac did not see any Medicare patients and a limited number of Medicaid patients.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to families under 200 percent poverty level, a great deal of their health, and one of the largest determinants of their health, is social \u2014 getting transportation to regular medical care, language barriers, where they live, exposure to toxins,\u201d said Dr. John Whiteside, chief medical officer at Marillac.\n\nWhen barriers to accessing health care are put up, including ability to pay or ability to find a physician who will take certain insurance, patients either won\u2019t seek treatment or will use emergency rooms as doctor offices, Whiteside said.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re successful, it will be transformative to Mesa County in that all of a sudden, these working poor families actually have access to high quality care,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are taking on new patients very quickly and growing very fast. We are seeing a bunch of adolescents who have never had an immunization shot in their life.\u201d\n\nMarillac\u2019s push to become financially sustainable and expand services is because the need to serve the uninsured and under-insured is real.\n\nAccording to the Mesa County Health Department, approximately 33 percent of county residents live below 200 percent of the federal poverty line. In Colorado, that rate is 29 percent.\n\nMore than 45,200 Mesa County residents are on Medicaid and more than 1,700 children are CHP+ members, the Colorado Department of Health Care Policy & Financing reported at the end of January.\n\nLast year, that same department showed the rate of under-insured in the county was 22 percent, up from 15.6 percent in 2013.\n\nThe call to provide medical services to this population is why Whiteside took the job in 2014, even though the future of Marillac at that time was unclear.\n\nSince the FQHC designation, Marillac has hired three doctors and three nurse practitioners on top of the dental and optical services already in place.\n\nTwo of those doctors, Dr. Katie McCrea and Dr. Elizabeth Buisker, joined Marillac in August.\n\nMcCrea knew Whiteside from his time as associate director of St. Mary\u2019s Family Residency Program. After her residency at St. Mary\u2019s, McCrea went to New Zealand to work around universal health care.\n\nWhen she heard Whiteside accepted a position at Marillac and learned about the changes the clinic had implemented, she was in.\n\n\u201cI enjoy taking care of children and the whole family,\u201d McCrea said. \u201cThat fact that we can do that is really exciting.\u201d\n\nBuisker, on the other hand, spent several years in Meeker, practicing medicine in a rural setting before moving to Grand Junction. She did her residency in Denver.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m super excited to be involved at this point, knowing all the changes you are going to be in the middle of and having a real say in,\u201d Buisker said.\n\nLast year, Marillac saw 5,600 people between its primary location on Sixth Street and its clinic at the Mesa County Health Department, 510 29 1/2 Road.\n\nThis year, Whiteside said Marillac\u2019s providers want to see 11,000 patients.\n\nDoubling in size in one year is bold, but Whiteside said Marillac already is looking to add staff and offer more services at its Health Department location due to demand.\n\n\u201cIt really is herculean and amazing how much we\u2019ve done in a year,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had hoped we would be selected as a federally qualified health center, and it is pretty phenomenal that we were selected. There were 700 practices or so that started the application process. Of the 140 awarded, 120 of them were only for extensions. There are 20 new sites, and Marillac was one of them.\u201d\n\nMarillac\u2019s primary location at 2333 N. Sixth St. is open from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Wednesday and Friday and from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. on Thursday. That clinic can be reached at 298-1782.\n\nThe county clinic is open 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Wednesday and Friday and 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Thursday.
