Thanks to a donation from some friends, the local library system will soon house several computer stations targeted to enhancing the reading and learning of young patrons.

Forsyth County Public Library board members unanimously approved the purchase of AWE Early Literacy Stations, educational software that provides an all-in-one digital learning solution for children ages 2-8.

Content offers more than 70 programs that do not require an Internet connection but spans seven curricular areas. It is available in English, bilingual Spanish and bilingual French and will be offered at every branch.

Educational programs are pre-loaded on the computer and displayed using “engaging graphics and intuitive menus.”

“From Math Doodles and Speakaboos e-books to Dora the Explorer, there is something special available for every child’s learning preference,” according to the AWE website.

The stations cost $19,000. The FCPL Friends and Advocates, which donates annually to the library system with profits collected from book sales and fundraisers, offered about $10,000 toward the bill.

Board member Kristin Morrissey thanked the Friends and Advocates for their continued support, nothing that “we wouldn’t be where we are” without their donations.

Sanjay Saggere, vice president of the nonprofit, said the group has donated about $30,000 each of the past couple years. They have already earmarked so much in donations for the upcoming fiscal year.
