The prescription, which was paid for by Medicare, was delivered to another man named David Hatch, who was Dr. Terry's patient.\n\nLike Healthcare Finance on Facebook\n\nAuthorities also said Dr. Terry provided prescriptions for Oxycodone and other narcotics to another patient, Thomas Ray, also of Wellsboro, who they say Terry should have known \"was not seeking the drugs for legitimate medical purposes.\" Medicaid paid for the medically unnecessary prescriptions written for Mr. Ray, the U.S. Attorney's Office said.\n\nA federal search warrant was executed at Dr. Terry's office in July of 2013, at which point he voluntarily agreed to surrender his DEA registration and medical license. Ray already pleaded guilty and will be sentenced this month. According to the USAO, plea agreements have been filed against Terry, Heffner and Hatch.\n\nTwitter: @BethJSanborn", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/pennsylvania-physician-charged-health-care-fraud-writing-fraudulent-oxycodone-scripts", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/fraud%20feature_0.png", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Healthcare Fraud charges have been filed against Dr. John Terry, 65, of Wellsboro, in connection with false prescriptions for Oxycodone authorities say he wrote, said the U.S. Attorney's Office.", "title": "Pennsylvania physician charged with health care fraud for writing fraudulent Oxycodone scripts"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HC_Finance", "image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/fraud%20feature_0.png"}, "description": "Healthcare Fraud charges have been filed against Dr. John Terry, 65, of Wellsboro, in connection with false prescriptions for Oxycodone authorities say he wrote, said the U.S. Attorney's Office.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Pennsylvania physician charged with health care fraud for writing fraudulent Oxycodone scripts"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Healthcare Fraud charges have been filed against Dr. John Terry, 65, of Wellsboro, in connection with false prescriptions for Oxycodone authorities say he wrote, said the U.S. Attorney's Office.&#13; According to U.S. Attorney Peter Smith, in April of 2013, Dr. Terry allegedly caused Medicare to be billed for false prescriptions intended for one man, Stephen Heffner, Jr., who was not his patient.
