Rhodes' confident down-to-earth, every-man style of speaking ultimately won him great fame and influence on national television, beloved by millions.\n\nI\u2019ll be honest with you folks. When Trump broke the mold with his bold straight-talk politically incorrect campaigning, I loved it. The arrogance of the mainstream media has frosted me for years. So Trump getting into the MSM\u2019s face had me cheering him on. I was also hopeful that, as president, Trump would fulfill all the broken promises of the deceitful, traitorous GOP establishment.\n\nAs we move into the final months of the GOP nominating process, art is imitating real-life. Trump\u2019s behavior is similar to \u201cLonesome\u201d Rhodes in the movie. Rhodes was not the person his millions of loyal fans thought him to be. At the end of a broadcast, the same producer who discovered Rhodes turned Rhodes' microphone back on, unknown to him. Rhodes made shocking hurtful comments about his audience, heard by and devastating millions.\n\nRecent liberal positions on issues have exposed that Trump is not who he has presented himself to be. It has been reported that in a private meeting with GOP establishment leaders, Trump\u2019s \u201cchief lieutenants\u201d said Trump has been \u201cprojecting an image.\u201d They said \u201cthe part that he\u2019s been playing is evolving\u201d to make him more palatable to general election voters.\n\nTrump talking about raising taxes on the rich and saying it is okay for men to use girls' restrooms confirm the leftward \u201cevolving\u201d his campaign spoke of.\n\nSpeaking of taxes, Trump\u2019s tax returns reveals that he donated funds to homosexual activists including a group whose motto is \u201cchampioning LGBT issues in K-12 education.\u201d\n\nMy Conservative Campaign Committee team and I attended a rip-roaring Ted Cruz rally in Pittsburgh yesterday. Our efforts for Cruz have included attending rallies in 10 states thus far. I detected a new level of desperation and hope. Clearly, steel town (Pittsburgh) voters are ready for real change, confident that Cruz will not betray them in the White House.\n\nCruz received numerous enthusiastic standing ovations for his rock-solid conservative position on several issues: defending religious liberty, abolishing the IRS, repealing Obamacare and no amnesty.\n\nAmericans are fed up. Cruz is the only candidate who truly understands and shares the urgency we feel. Cruz promises to do everything in his power to fight the Washington, DC, cartel, restoring our lost jobs, freedom and national security.\n\nFolks, this man is for real. He ain\u2019t another face in the crowd. This is why we at Conservative Campaign Committee travel the country to ensure that Ted Cruz is our next president of the United States.\n\nLloyd Marcus, The Unhyphenated American\n\nChairman, Conservative Campaign Committee", "article_metadata": {"csrf-token": "DSnwdz868taK8za1TR3aOwV22whcIWURspbSllielNw=", "msapplication-TileColor": "#2b5797", "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "og": {"site_name": "The Patriot Post", "description": "When Trump&rsquo;s unorthodox style of campaigning for president first took the political world by storm, I thought his ability to connect with the public is a real-life version of the movie, &ldquo;A Face in the Crowd.&rdquo;  In the 1957 film, Andy Griffith played &ldquo;Lonesome&rdquo; Rhodes,...", "title": "Cruz: Not Another Face in the Crowd", "url": "http://patriotpost.us/commentary/42172", "image": "http://assets.patriotpost.com.s3.amazonaws.com/images/logo/seal.png", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100002378661032, "app_id": 217327155053459}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/mstile-144x144.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "I was also hopeful that, as president, Trump would fulfill all the broken promises of the deceitful, traitorous GOP establishment.\nLloyd Marcus, The Unhyphenated AmericanChairman, Conservative Campaign Committee\nAt the end of a broadcast, the same producer who discovered Rhodes turned Rhodes' microphone back on, unknown to him.\nThis is why we at Conservative Campaign Committee travel the country to ensure that Ted Cruz is our next president of the United States.\nHe ain\u2019t another face in the crowd."}
