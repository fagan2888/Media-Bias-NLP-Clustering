If you want a scientific opinion, you ask a scientist, not a politician.

It is a purely political and rhetorical exercise.\n\nThe relevant scholars in the field do not \u201cbelieve in\u201d evolution, any more than a physicist \u201cbelieves in\u201d the proposition that objects subject to earth\u2019s gravity accelerate toward the pavement at 9.8 meters per second squared \u2014 they know. As an intellectual matter, Scott Walker\u2019s proclaiming that he \u201cbelieves in\u201d evolution would be precisely as meaningful as his proclaiming that he doesn\u2019t \u201cbelieve in\u201d evolution \u2014 he has little or no relevant knowledge about the subject, and his choosing the right answer would be as intellectually significant as a chicken playing tic-tac-toe or infinite monkeys banging out Shakespearean sonnets on infinite typewriters. This is obvious if you ask a similar question about a field that doesn\u2019t carry a similar pop-culture charge: Does Harry Reid believe that Ezra Pound\u2019s contributions to The Waste-Land were in fact so profound and meaningful that he should be considered something like the coauthor of the poem? Who knows?

If you want to know whether Scott Walker is one of them \u2014 or whether as president he\u2019d insist that NASA use a pre-Copernican model of the solar system the next time it launches a Mars probe \u2014 then ask that question. Walker hasn\u2019t given any indication that he is in fact such a politician, but if it sets anxious minds at ease, then, by all means, make the relevant inquiry.\n\nI have made the point here a dozen times \u2014 and you\u2019d think that one of these big-on-science guys like Neil deGrasse Tyson or Bill Nye would take up the cause \u2014 that there is in reality an important federal project under way giving rank pseudoscience and pure hokum the force of law: Obamacare, which, thanks to the efforts of Senator Tom Harkin (D., Iowa), will oblige taxpayers to subsidize all manner of scientifically illegitimate \u201calternative medicine.\u201d Everybody wants to know what Scott Walker and Sarah Palin think about evolution, but almost nobody is asking what Nancy Pelosi and Barack Obama think about homeopathy, acupuncture, aromatherapy, and the like. The same people who are scandalized that Walker doesn\u2019t want to talk about something that he doesn\u2019t know the first thing about celebrate as the most important health-care advance in a generation a law that treats as legitimate sundry species of quackery based in pure mysticism.\n\nWhy?\n\nAs usual, it comes down to aesthetics: If you\u2019re a coastal progressive type, people who believe that every word of the Bible is literally true in a natural-history sense are creepy and weird, but when Dr. Moonbeam McEarthgoddess promises to manipulate your mystical energy pathways so that your qi cures your osteoarthritis \u2014 then, bring on the federal subsidies.\n\nStrange that nobody has asked Scott Walker whether he believes the federal government should be subsidizing Reiki.
