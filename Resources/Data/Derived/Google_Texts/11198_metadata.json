Indeed, the thought was that denying care for transgender medical care saved money for policy holders. This report shows that's not true.\"\n\n\"There are important costs\u2014both to insurers and the public\u2014associated with denying care to transgender individuals. They include the costs of psychotherapy, public assistance, unemployment, and care for new physical symptoms.\"\n\nHodson, an insurance industry professional, became interested in the issue when his own daughter was denied coverage just two weeks before a gender-reassignment operation that had been planned for two years for her transition, even though it was supposed to be covered. She eventually became the first person covered a new Connecticut state insurance mandate that became effective in 2014.\n\nThe survey of more than 355 transgender-identified individuals, among the first to focus on denial of health care, was conducted by TrueChild in May of 2015. The average age among respondents was 35. Although the majority (85%) were living full-time in a gender different from their birth sex, only about half (54%) had completed all or part of their physical transitions. A copy of the report is available from TrueChild.\n\nTrue Benefit assists businesses in developing comprehensive strategies for their Employee Benefit programs.\n\nTrueChild (no relation to True Benefit) helps institutions and practitioners integrate a focus on the impact of rigid gender norms through funding priorities, programs, and public policy.\n\nContacts:\n\nJohn Hodson (203) 988-8806 Email\n\nRiki Wilchins (202) 309-1416 Email\n\nwww.truechild.org www.true-benefit.com\n\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/as-obamacare-extends-support-for-transgender-surgery-survey-finds-that-denying-care-has-costs-for-insurers-public-too-300138950.html\n\nSOURCE TrueChild\n\nRelated Links\n\nhttp://www.truechild.org\n\n", "article_metadata": {"geo.region": "district of columbia", "cf_entity_thumbnail_url": "http://content.prnewswire.com/designimages/logo-prn-01_PRN.gif", "geo.placename": "WASHINGTON, Sept. 8", "description": "WASHINGTON, Sept. 8, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- As Obamacare Extends Support for Transgender Surgery, Survey Finds that Denying Care Has Costs for Insurers,...", "author": "TrueChild", "og": {"url": "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/as-obamacare-extends-support-for-transgender-surgery-survey-finds-that-denying-care-has-costs-for-insurers-public-too-300138950.html", "image": "http://content.prnewswire.com/images/prn_facebook_sharing_logo.jpg", "type": "website", "description": "WASHINGTON, Sept. 8, 2015 /PRNewswire/ --\u00a0As Obama administration proposes new rules that would prevent health...", "title": "As Obamacare Extends Support for Transgender Surgery, Survey Finds that Denying Care Has Costs for Insurers, Public Too"}, "Publisher": "PR Newswire", "cf_entity_title": "As Obamacare Extends Support for Transgender Surgery, Survey Finds that Denying Care Has Costs for Insurers, Public Too", "robots": "index, follow", "p": {"domain_verify": "7d052ac42aa9e7505635404745861994"}, "keywords": "TrueChild, district of columbia, Surveys, Polls and Research, Lesbian, Gay & Bisexual, Health Care & Hospitals", "date": "2015-09-08T08:37:00Z", "msvalidate.01": "9D28F7743C790DD88F2D9C7375EF7ED5", "twitter": {"site": "@PRNewswire", "card": "summary"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Indeed, the thought was that denying care for transgender medical care saved money for policy holders.\nThe report also found that 37% of respondents denied care turned to drugs and/or alcohol, and 36% developed other physical symptoms.\nSaid John Hodson, President of True-Benefit which commissioned the report, \"Insurers and policy-makers have had an antiquated list of exclusions written that have not evolved over several decades.\n\"There are important costs\u2014both to insurers and the public\u2014associated with denying care to transgender individuals.\nThey include the costs of psychotherapy, public assistance, unemployment, and care for new physical symptoms.\""}
