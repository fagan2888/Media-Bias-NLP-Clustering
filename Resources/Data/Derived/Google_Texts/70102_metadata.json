But that doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t happen. Sick patients sometimes ask for help in hastening their deaths, and some doctors will explain, vaguely, how to do it.\n\n\u201cI remember standing there with syringes in my hand. Just standing there, with my hands shaking, and I was all alone.\u201d\n\nThis leads to bizarre, veiled conversations between medical professionals who want to help, but also want to avoid prosecution, and overwhelmed family members who are left to interpret euphemisms at one of the most confusing times of their lives.\n\nThat\u2019s what still frustrates Hope Arnold. She says throughout the 10 months her husband J.D. Falk was being treated for stomach cancer in 2011, no one would talk straight with them.\n\n\u201cAll the nurses, all the doctors,\u201d says Hope, \u201ceverybody we ever interacted with, no one said, \u2018You\u2019re dying.\u2019 \u201d\n\nUntil finally, one doctor did. And that\u2019s when J.D. started to plan. He summoned his extended family. And Hope made arrangements for him to come home on hospice.\n\nThe day he was discharged from the hospital, Hope was dropping off some paperwork when she bumped into one of J.D.\u2019s doctors.\n\n\u201cHe hugged me and asked me how I was holding up,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd then he handed me a bottle of liquid morphine. He said, \u2018You might need it.\u2019 \u201d\n\nHope says she handed the bottle back. She told the doctor the hospice was going to drop off a machine that would administer J.D.\u2019s pain medication automatically.\n\n\u201cAnd he looked at me,\u201d she says, \u201cand he held my gaze for a second. And he put it back in my hand and he said, \u2018You Might. Need it.\u2019\u201d\n\nShe slipped the vial into her purse.\n\n\u201cWhen I got home, it hit me like a ton of bricks,\u201d Hope remembers. \u201cAnd I said to J.D., \u2018I think he may have given this to me so I can give you an overdose.\u2019 And he said, \u2018Maybe.\u2019 And then we didn\u2019t talk about it anymore.\u201d\n\nOver the next couple days, J.D. deteriorated quickly. Hope says the hospice nurse offered another euphemism.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018He\u2019s showing signs of imminence.\u2019 \u201d\n\nHope worried that J.D. was in a lot of pain. But she couldn\u2019t tell. She was afraid that if she asked, it would betray the thoughts she was having about that extra vial of morphine.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t ask the nurse that,\u201d Hope says. \u201cI couldn\u2019t ask anybody anything.\u201d\n\nIn the end, she didn\u2019t do it.\n\n\u201cJ.D. never told me, \u2018I do want you to give me too much morphine,\u2019 \u201d Hope says. \u201cActually, I don\u2019t know whether or not he wanted that. That\u2019s not the point. The point was nobody could talk about it.\u201d\n\nPeople don\u2019t talk about it, but it\u2019s happening. Just over 3 percent of U.S. doctors say they have written a prescription for life-ending medication, according to an anonymous survey published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Almost 5 percent of doctors reported giving a patient a lethal injection.\n\nOther studies suggest oncologists, and doctors on the West Coast, are more likely to be asked for life-ending medication, or euthanasia, in which the doctor administers the lethal dose.\n\n\u201cThose practices are undercover, they are covert,\u201d says Barbara Coombs Lee, president of Compassion and Choices, an advocacy group that is backing legislation in California to make it legal for doctors to prescribe lethal medication to terminally-ill patients who request it.\n\n\u201cTo the degree that patients are part of the decision-making,\u201d Coombs Lee says, \u201cit is by winks and nods.\u201d\n\nHer organization actually guides dying patients how to get around current law.\n\n\u201cWe talk with people about how they might broach the subject with their physicians,\u201d she says, \u201cand quite frankly, how to play the wink-and-nod game in a way that doesn\u2019t jeopardize their physician.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a game Laura Bennett is all too familiar with. (Laura\u2019s name has been changed to protect her privacy.) Laura lived in San Francisco during the 1980s and watched one friend after another die of AIDS.\n\n\u201cThe guys would have fungus everywhere,\u201d she recounts. \u201cHorrible diarrheas, emaciation. \u201cIt looked like concentration camp pictures.\u201d\n\nA lot of the guys begged for lethal drugs to end their suffering. Laura and her friends figured out which doctors were willing to help.\n\n\u201cWe would tell each other, \u2018This is the doctor,'\u201d she says. \u201c\u2018They\u2019re going to tell you how much is too much to give, and then they\u2019re going to give you too much.'\u201d\n\nThough Laura witnessed many deaths hastened in this way, she says she never injected the drugs herself. Her time would come 20 years later when her husband John was dying of throat cancer. (John\u2019s name has also been changed).\n\nSome of his symptoms were brutal.\n\n\u201cIt was like a horror movie,\u201d Laura says, recalling the tumors all over John\u2019s neck. They would fill with blood, she says, and sometimes burst.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019d be blood on the walls, on the mirror, everywhere,\u201d Laura recounts, \u201cand I\u2019d be trying to keep him from drowning in it because it\u2019d be going down his trach. And he\u2019d be panicking.\u201d\n\nJohn was warned his death might be ugly. He might choke. He might have a seizure. More than anything, Laura says, John was afraid of dying in a hospital, hooked up to machines, powerless.\n\n\u201cHe made me swear not to let anybody hospitalize him,\u201d she says. \u201cHe made me swear not to let his family swoop in and take him away.\u201d\n\nAt one point, John threatened to shoot himself to avoid that. Laura says a nurse dropped hints that there was a different way.\n\n\u201cI remember being told, here\u2019s how much pain meds you can give,\u201d she says, \u201cbut beyond this, he\u2019ll probably stop breathing.\u201d\n\nJohn made it clear to Laura that this was the way he wanted to go. Several times, she says, he reviewed the instructions with her.\n\nMonths later, John slipped into a coma. When the nurse said he looked like he was a day, maybe hours, away from dying, Laura took it as another hint.\n\n\u201cAnd I remember standing there with syringes in my hand. Just standing there, with my hands shaking,\u201d she says. She remembers thinking, \u201cOkay, what goes with what, goes with what?\u201d Laura\u2019s voice falters. \u201cAnd I was all alone. And that was about the most alone I\u2019ve ever felt. That I couldn\u2019t tell anybody else.\u201d\n\nShe injected the drugs. Then she crawled into bed with John and held him and talked to him for the next six hours.\n\n\u201cAnd he literally died in my arms. I was holding him when he stopped breathing,\u201d Laura says. \u201cAnd it was really peaceful. He just sort of drifted away.\u201d\n\nFor years after John was gone, Laura had nightmares. Nightmares of staring at those syringes in her hand.\n\nToday, she is confident that she did the right thing. John\u2019s death was calm and peaceful and exactly what he\u2019d asked for. But Laura resents that she was the one who had to do it, that she had no help, no real guidance from a medical professional.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t regret it, but I wouldn\u2019t wish it on anybody else. It\u2019s not fair. It\u2019s not right,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not like choosing to die doesn\u2019t happen. We just make it be sneaky and we put it on the wrong people.\u201d\n\nMedical experts say stories like these are symptoms of a far bigger problem. Stanford medical ethicist David Magnus says doctors are just plain bad at communicating about death.\n\n\u201cWhat we really need is a much better, comprehensive discussion with patients about what they really want and what they care about and what they value,\u201d Magnus says, \u201cand that\u2019s exactly what you tend not to get in medical settings.\u201d\n\nThis leads to confusion. Magnus suggests that what some people interpret as hints on how to hasten someone\u2019s death, actually aren\u2019t.\n\n\u201cAcross the board with end-of-life care clinical interactions, they\u2019re full of misunderstandings and misinterpretations,\u201d he says.\n\nOn the flip side, Magnus says what some people believe is assisted suicide, actually isn\u2019t. It is legal for people to take or give large doses of narcotics to relieve pain, even if a known side-effect is that it may hasten death.\n\n\u201cThe difference really has to do with intent,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a tricky thing because it has to do with what\u2019s going on in the mind.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s such a fine line. When doctors are already so bad at understanding what dying patients and their families want, how good can they be at deciphering why?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Though physician-assisted suicide is not legal in California, families find a way to do it \u2013 in secret.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Death in Secret: California's Underground World of Assisted Suicide\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2015\\/04\\/22\\/death-in-secret-californias-underground-world-of-assisted-suicide\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-04-22 00:03:35\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-04-23 07:31:59\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":25017,\"author_id\":\"3205\",\"author_name\":\"April Dembosky\",\"author_display_name\":\"April Dembosky\",\"tags\":[\"Aid in Dying\"],\"categories\":[\"Policy\",\"Tests &amp; Treatments\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2015\\/04\\/2.5.2011.2-e1429662884614.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "Though physician-assisted suicide is not legal in California, families find a way to do it \u2013 in secret.", "title": "Death in Secret: California\u2019s Underground World of Assisted Suicide", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2015/04/22/death-in-secret-californias-underground-world-of-assisted-suicide/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2015/04/9.12.2009-1a-300x288.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "aid in dying", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0f94\"", "article_summary": "When the nurse said he looked like he was a day, maybe hours, away from dying, Laura took it as another hint.\nWhen doctors are already so bad at understanding what dying patients and their families want, how good can they be at deciphering why?\n\u201cTo the degree that patients are part of the decision-making,\u201d Coombs Lee says, \u201cit is by winks and nods.\u201dHer organization actually guides dying patients how to get around current law.\nOn the flip side, Magnus says what some people believe is assisted suicide, actually isn\u2019t.\nMore than anything, Laura says, John was afraid of dying in a hospital, hooked up to machines, powerless."}
