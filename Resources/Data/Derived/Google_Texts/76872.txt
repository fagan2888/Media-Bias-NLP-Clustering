MOSCOW (AP) â€” The Russian Defense Ministry has released photographs of its new tank, which will be shown to the public for the first time during next month's Victory Day parade on Red Square.

The photographs show the T-14 Armata tank with its turret covered with fabric. Only the platform, which also will be used for other armored vehicles, is visible.

The tank is said to surpass all Western versions because of its remotely controlled cannon and the protection it offers its crew.

The T-14, which replaces the T-72 and T-90, is set to undergo trials next year.

The military parade on Red Square on May 9 is getting even more attention than usual as Russia commemorates the 70th anniversary of victory over Nazi Germany in World War II.
