A man has died and two others were injured in a crash early Sunday morning in western Kansas.

It happened at 3:30 a.m. in Wichita County, about 20 miles north of Leoti on County Road 18. The Kansas Highway Patrol said a 2010 Doge Ram pickup was heading north on the county road when it missed a turn at Adobe Road, overcorrected and overturned.

A passenger in the pickup died at the scene. Troopers identified him as 22-year-old Blake Nickelson of Leoti.

The driver, 24-year-old Michael Beaver, and a second passenger, 23-year-old Lauren Apperson, were taken to a local hospital with potentially serious injuries. Both are from Scott City.

The crash remains under investigation.
