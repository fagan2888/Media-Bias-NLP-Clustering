When emergency care is provided by a physician not in one of these so-called \u201cskinny\u201d networks, the carriers simply refuse to pay the physician or hospital a reasonable fee for that service. In some cases, merely because they hold all the cards, the insurer refuses to pay anything.\n\nThis gives the physicians or hospitals providing the service no choice but to turn to the patient for payment. This creates an awful situation for everyone involved, resulting in a costly surprise bill for patients and an awkward situation for those docs who provided care when it was most needed.\n\nA very disturbing epilogue toGentry\u2019s story is being written right now in Tallahassee, as some of our state\u2019s lawmakers are considering a bill that will make this scenario even worse.\n\nTo solve the problem of out-of-network insurance coverage gaps, HB 221 looks to the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) for its solution. Lifting an entire Obamacare section nearly word for word, HB 221 puts even more power into the hands of insurance companies. Like the federal healthcare regulation, this bill puts into law a legalized price-setting scheme that allows PPO\u2019s and insurance companies to pay unfairly low rates for services that their customers have received.\n\nFlorida\u2019s physician anesthesiologists recognize the problems the current scenario causes patients and their families. We also believe that doctors who provide emergency services should not be forced to ask patients to pay for care but should be able to negotiate on evenhanded terms with insurers.\n\nWe are willing to work with lawmakers to repair HB 221 and put a system in place where patients are not handed surprise bills and both doctors and hospitals are paid an equitable and balanced fee for life-saving medical care.\n\nDr. Jay Epstein of Clearwater is an anesthesiologist who is board certified in anesthesiology and critical-care medicine.
