Tom Emmer was sworn in, he has attended an NAACP gathering in St. Cloud, the Martin Luther King Jr. breakfast in Minneapolis and marched in the same Alabama civil rights parade as President Obama.\n\nHe has had one-on-one breakfasts and coffees with more than a dozen Democrats and Republicans on his subcommittees and on one recent Saturday around midnight, lambasted his party for holding up cash to fund the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nIn other words, Emmer, a one-time gubernatorial candidate who replaced Tea Party firebrand Rep. Michele Bachmann, the man who for years made headlines for his conservative fire and edgy ideas, is calming down.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s less conservative. More than 97 percent of the votes he\u2019s cast in the past two months are in line with GOP leadership. Emmer vociferously supported building the Keystone pipeline and recently touted the need for Israel to defend itself after hearing from the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the U.S. Capitol \u2014 a speech so controversial among Democrats that a handful, Sen. Al Franken and Rep. Betty McCollum among them, boycotted it.\n\nYet gone \u2014 or at least pushed beneath the surface \u2014 is the Emmer some Minnesotans may remember, a take-no-prisoners state lawmaker who called for chemically castrating sex offenders, halting funding of prenatal care for undocumented immigrants and letting pharmacists reject prescriptions on moral grounds.\n\nIn his first few months in Washington, Emmer has not yet authored any bills. He has spent substantial time reaching across the aisle to Democrats for breakfasts and coffees \u2014 an attempt at comity he says will aid him in the future.\n\nEmmer took a phone call in his Otsego office. At a recent meeting with the NAACP, he described himself as working in Congress\u2019 \u201ccustomer service department.\u201d\n\nHe wants everyone to know that he still has the same beliefs as he did in the early days \u2014 he just has a different approach.\n\n\u201cBefore, probably because of my training, being an advocate, before I had a different approach,\u201d Emmer said. \u201cIn a legislative forum, this environment, it\u2019s more about winning people over and not running them over. \u2026 I think I had to learn that.\u201d\n\nAfter Obama\u2019s sixth State of the Union address in January, and Emmer\u2019s first, the congressman e-mailed out a statement calling on Congress to work together with the president.\n\n\u201cIt was an honor to hear from the president this evening,\u201d Emmer said. \u201cIf he\u2019s ready to get to work on the change that Americans demanded last November, Congress will be here waiting.\u201d\n\nEmmer\u2019s diplomatic tone has taken both his allies and foes by surprise. After seeing Emmer at the recent Twin Cities MLK breakfast, one DFL operative privately murmured that the congressman \u201cwasn\u2019t making any mistakes.\u201d A local Tea Party leader sharply rebuked Emmer in a blog post for his vote in support of funding the Department of Homeland Security.\n\n\u201cOne of the things he emphasized leading up to being elected was that he didn\u2019t want to necessarily be combative,\u201d said Luke Yurczyk, GOP chair for the Sixth Congressional District. \u201cI think the district wants a fighter, but I think they aren\u2019t necessarily interested in political games. I think he understands that.\u201d\n\nEven though she hasn\u2019t agreed with his votes, Jessica Andrist, a DFLer in his district, called Emmer\u2019s approach a welcome departure from Bachmann\u2019s constant limelight-seeking.\n\n\u201cHe hopefully will listen to constituents,\u201d she said. \u201cHopefully he\u2019ll be less embarrassing than Michele Bachmann.\u201d\n\nEmmer is modest \u2014 even soft-spoken \u2014 when describing his job representing the roughly 760,000 souls in Minnesota\u2019s Sixth District. When he walked into the NAACP meeting in St. Cloud and sat in the back, he says he told the crowd of about 25, \u201cI\u2019m from the customer service department from the U.S. Congress, and I work for you.\u201d\n\nEmmer acknowledges being chastened by his narrow gubernatorial loss in 2010 \u2014 Gov. Mark Dayton beat him by less than a percentage point \u2014 and by the steep learning curve and entrenched pecking order in Washington.\n\nHe has yet to find an apartment in Washington. Instead, he says, he has prioritized spending his three to four nights a week here attending events and trying to scratch out time for one-on-ones with Republicans and Democrats on the subcommittees.\n\nWhen he wraps up business each day at 9 or 10 p.m., the 54-year-old married father of six pulls an air mattress out of a storage closet in the Cannon House Office Building, lugs it into his office and makes it up with sheets and blankets. Emmer wakes up every morning at 4:30 or 5 a.m. to hit the treadmill in the House gym and then shower.\n\n\u201cThere is no breathing room,\u201d he said. \u201cNone.\u201d\n\nEmmer notes his strategy is part freshman humility and part example-setting for what he hopes Republicans will embrace in the coming key political years, including the 2016 presidential race. He recently authored an op-ed in The Hill newspaper detailing his plans to replace the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cRepublicans in general, instead of constantly being in a spat with the president, they need to be leading for the American public to see,\u201d Emmer said. \u201cWe may not get a president who will sign a Keystone bill or get rid of the FCC takeover of the Internet \u2026 but at least the American public will know what we stand for, who should be leading America.\u201d\n\nJack Rogers, president of the Minnesota Tea Party Alliance and a constituent of Emmer\u2019s, recently spoke out against Emmer\u2019s votes to fully fund the Department of Homeland Security and to support Rep. John Boehner as House speaker. Rogers acknowledged receiving a lengthy phone call from Emmer after expressing his concerns.\n\nGLEN STUBBE \u2022 gstubbe@startribune.com Rep. Tom Emmer, right, was challenged by Tea Party Patriots co-coordinator Ben Riechers for voting to approve funding to the Department of Homeland Security during a recent meeting with the conservative group in Brooklyn Center.\n\n\u201cTom and I are friends, and it\u2019s like having a brother or a best friend and all of a sudden they\u2019re not thinking along the same paradigms as you are,\u201d Rogers said. \u201cIt takes you off guard.\u201d\n\nEmmer has some ambitions for his party and potential problems they could tackle before the next election \u2014 including a tax code overhaul and a number of bills that would cut regulations.\n\nBut acknowledging where he is in Washington\u2019s grand order, Emmer says it is most important that he keep his priorities local. He also laughed loudly when asked about higher ambitions \u2014 perhaps another run at governor.\n\n\u201cPeople who say they are one thing today and try to do something else tomorrow is exactly what\u2019s wrong with the political process,\u201d he said. \u201cI have no desire today to do anything different than what I\u2019m doing now.\u201d\n\nAllison Sherry \u2022 1-202-383-6120\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "Tom Emmer, a one-time gubernatorial candidate who for years made headlines for his conservative fire and edgy ideas, is calming down.
