The Obama administration reportedly wants to appease big-business interests so they give him air cover for his potential executive amnesty, which may enable millions of illegal immigrants to get work permits in addition to temporary amnesty.\n\nAll of these actions would make it tougher for Americans at the bottom of the economic ladder to get jobs, as U.S. Civil Rights Commissioner Peter Kirsanow has repeatedly emphasized. And as Breitbart News has reported, Americans are increasingly demanding a \u201cpause\u201d in the number of guest-workers who are admitted. A Reuters poll \u201cfound that 70% of Americans feel illegal immigrants threaten U.S. beliefs and customs, 63% believe more immigration at this time threatens the country\u2019s economy, and 45% want fewer immigrants. A recent poll from The Polling Company found that 90% of likely voters feel that \u201cU.S.-born workers and legal immigrants already here should get first preference for jobs.\u201d Strong majorities of those who favor a pathway to legalization and citizenship for illegal immigrants even believe that \u201cjobs now held by illegal immigrants should go to American workers.\u201d\n\nSen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL) accused the Obama administration of \u201cactively working against the interests of the American worker.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have communities throughout America that are barely scraping by. Tens of millions of Americans are on welfare, unemployment, and public assistance,\u201d Sessions said in a statement this week. \u201cYet the White House and their Senate Majority seem more concerned about the economic demands of large corporations, or the citizens of other countries, than about getting our own citizens back to work into stable jobs that can support a family and uplift a community.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obama Considering Granting 800K Guest-Worker Visas as 90% Believe American Workers Should Be Favored", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Obama Considering Granting 800K Guest-Worker Visas as 90% Believe American Workers Should Be Favored", "title": "Obama Considering Granting 800K Guest-Worker Visas as 90% Believe American Workers Should Be Favored - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/Barack-and-Michelle/obama-uncle-sam-ap.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2014/08/21/obama-considering-unilaterally-granting-800k-guest-worker-visas-as-90-believe-american-workers-should-be-favored/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Obama Considering Granting 800K Guest-Worker Visas as 90% Believe American Workers Should Be Favored", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/Barack-and-Michelle/obama-uncle-sam-ap.jpg", "title": "Obama Considering Granting 800K Guest-Worker Visas as 90% Believe American Workers Should Be Favored - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Illegal Immigrants, Senate, White House,Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "White House", "published_time": "2014-08-21T11:57:00-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERAfter meeting with a \u201cbevy\u201d of big-business groups, President Barack Obama is reportedly considering granting them up to 800,000 additional guest-worker visas via executive actions.\nA Reuters poll \u201cfound that 70% of Americans feel illegal immigrants threaten U.S. beliefs and customs, 63% believe more immigration at this time threatens the country\u2019s economy, and 45% want fewer immigrants.\nThe Obama administration reportedly wants to appease big-business interests so they give him air cover for his potential executive amnesty, which may enable millions of illegal immigrants to get work permits in addition to temporary amnesty.\nAnd as Breitbart News has reported, Americans are increasingly demanding a \u201cpause\u201d in the number of guest-workers who are admitted.\nTens of millions of Americans are on welfare, unemployment, and public assistance,\u201d Sessions said in a statement this week."}
