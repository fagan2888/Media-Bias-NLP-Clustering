Paul Ryan was busy revamping his image. He\u2019d spent most of his public life as the tax-cutting budget \u201cwonk\u201d who believed ardently in the power of supply-side economic theory, but after helping Mitt Romney take silver in the 2012 election, Ryan embarked on a political reinvention that would help dispel the GOP\u2019s well-earned reputation as the party of the wealthy. The end result of his efforts was Paul Ryan: The Republican Who Cares About Poor People.\n\nRyan gave the effort his all. He put out a dubiously researched study arguing that federal anti-poverty programs had failed and were doing little beyond breeding dependency on government largess. He also released a new anti-poverty plan that block-grants all federal anti-poverty programs and forces recipients of government aid to sign contracts promising that they\u2019ll be better, more successful Americans (or face \u201csanctions\u201d).\n\nRyan also sought a change in tone. For years he\u2019d happily divided America into \u201cmakers\u201d (successful rich folks who create jobs) and \u201ctakers\u201d (low-earners who grow fat on government programs funded by the \u201cmakers\u2019\u201d tax revenue). But the New Paul Ryan had learned his lesson and wasn\u2019t going to coarsen the economic inequality debate with insulting language of that sort. He apologized for using the makers-and-takers \u201cshorthand\u201d in a Wall Street Journal Op-Ed last August. \u201cThe phrase gave insult where none was intended,\u201d Ryan wrote. \u201cPeople struggling and striving to get ahead\u2014that\u2019s what our country is all about. On that journey, they\u2019re not \u2018takers\u2019; they\u2019re trying to make something of themselves. We shouldn\u2019t disparage that.\u201d\n\nWell, that was then. Ryan is the GOP\u2019s new point man on tax policy and he\u2019s being called upon to push back on President Obama\u2019s plans to finance tax credits for low earners with tax hikes on the wealthy. Ryan did just that in two separate interviews this weekend \u2013 with NBC News and the New York Times \u2013 and he test drove a new slogan for bashing the president\u2019s proposals: \u201cenvy economics.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s what he said on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d:\n\nRYAN: I think it [closing the \u201cstepped-up basis\u201d loophole] is a bad idea. You\u2019re actually making it really hard for a family to pass on a family business to the next generation. So what I think the President is trying to do here is to, again, exploit envy economics. This top-down redistribution doesn\u2019t work. We have been doing it for six years. Look, it may make for good politics. It doesn\u2019t make for good economic growth.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ryan apologized for previously calling the less fortunate \"takers.\" Here's what he must have meant instead", "title": "Paul Ryan\u2019s sorry invention: The GOP\u2019s self-appointed poverty warrior coins \u201cenvy economics\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Ryan apologized for previously calling the less fortunate \"takers.\" Here's what he must have meant instead", "title": "Paul Ryan\u2019s sorry invention: The GOP\u2019s self-appointed poverty warrior coins \u201cenvy economics\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/02/03/paul_ryans_sorry_invention_the_gops_self_appointed_poverty_warrior_coins_envy_economics/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/paul_ryan5.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ryan apologized for previously calling the less fortunate \"takers.\" Here's what he must have meant instead", "title": "Paul Ryan\u2019s sorry invention: The GOP\u2019s self-appointed poverty warrior coins \u201cenvy economics\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/paul_ryan5.jpg", "creator": "@SimonMaloy", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Simon Maloy", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, budgets, economic inequality, GOP, Income inequality, Paul Ryan, Poverty, Supply-side economics, Tax cuts, Tax reform, Taxes, The Right, trickle-down economics, War on Poverty", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: budgets, economic inequality, GOP, Income inequality, Paul Ryan, Poverty, Supply-side economics, Tax cuts, Tax reform, Taxes, The Right, trickle-down economics, War on Poverty, Politics NewsFor most of last year, Rep.
