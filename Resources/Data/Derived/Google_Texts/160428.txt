TOULON — A 76-year-old Wyoming man accused of molesting a preteen girl decided Friday to stay in the Stark County Jail awhile rather than seeking an immediate reduction in his $250,000 bond.

Dale T. Radke’s attorney, Kevin Sullivan of Peoria, had filed a motion asking that the bond be reduced, partly on the grounds that the Caterpillar Inc. retiree and Marine veteran could not pay the $25,000 cash required while living on a “meager pension” and Social Security.

But after meeting with Radke before a scheduled hearing, Sullivan told Circuit Judge Michael McCuskey that his client wanted to defer any consideration of that matter until at least a Feb. 27 pre-trial hearing.

Sullivan said outside court that Radke had not stated a specific reason, but had emphasized that he was being treated well and that some health concerns mentioned in the motion were being addressed.

“He said the food was good, he was getting his medications, and his blood was being tested daily (because of diabetes),” Sullivan said. “They’re taking good care of him.”

Radke faces two counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse, an offense with penalties ranging from probation to seven years in prison. He is tentatively scheduled for trial March 2.
