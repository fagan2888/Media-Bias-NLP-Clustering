Feeney said she has had to become fluent in medical codes and insurance jargon in order for her daughter to get the complex care and extensive medical equipment her needs.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe doctor sat us down and told us (Brianna) will never walk, talk and (will) need extensive care for the rest of her life,\u201d said Feeney, a 41-year-old freelance writer living in South Plainfield with her three children. \u201cYou hear that and you are completely devastated. The last thing you want is all of these bills. I was just paralyzed.\u201d\n\n\n\nAfter years of seeing families like the Feeneys juggle the demands of taking care of a disabled child while trying to advocate for their medical needs, Children\u2019s Specialized Hospital in Mountainside has developed an online tool to make the process easier, CEO Amy Mansue said.\n\n\n\nThe Health Insurance Education website features include \u201c6 Steps to Help You Understand your Family\u2019s Insurance Options,\u201d a glossary on common insurance terms, tips from other parents, and a fill-in-the-blank form that helps people compare their child\u2019s needs versus what their insurance plan covers.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe worked with families and asked them, what information do you want?\u201d Mansue said.\n\n\n\nThe Oct. 1 launch was timed to coincide with the November open enrollment periods for most insurance plans, including Obamacare, Mansue said. The health care reform law has spawned a lot of different options offered by employers, including private exchanges and high-deductible plans, she said. If parents are not careful, they could sign up for coverage that drains their bank accounts and denies the equipment or treatment their children need, she said.\n\n\n\n\u201cMy fear is it will be driven by what is cheapest and the consequences for parents whose children have long-term conditions will be catastrophic,\u201d Mansue said.\n\n\n\nAbout 3,000 people have logged on to the website since its Oct. 1 launch, hospital\u2019s spokeswoman Rebecca Mazzarella said.\n\n\n\nThe Statewide Parent Advocacy Network, an organization representing the interests of special-needs children and their families, gave feedback on the site before it went live, SPAN co-executive director Diana Autin said.\n\n\n\n\u201cNow we are having all of our staff using it as we talk to families,\u201d Autin said. \u201cIt\u2019s a great tool.\u201d\n\n\n\nAutin pointed to the results of a national survey that found about 50 percent of participants said their insurance coverage was inadequate or that they lacked coverage.\n\n\n\nThirty percent said they spent a minimum of $1,000 on out-of-pocket expenses, and one-quarter reported having trouble getting referrals to a specialist, according to 2009-10 National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs, the most recent data available.\n\n\n\n\u201cOverall compared to other states in the country, children in New Jersey have access to a stronger array of services,\u201d Autin added. \u201cBut we still have a situation where families have a difficult time finding plans that are affordable and include in-network the specialists they are seeing.\u201d\n\n\n\nBrianna Feeney -- one of the 24,000 patients Children\u2019s Specialized Hospital treats every year \u2013 relies heavily on expensive medical equipment, her mother said. A \u201cstander,\u201d a device that holds her upright, is $7,000. She\u2019s growing out of her wheelchair and bed, which will cost $8,000 and $10,000, respectively.\n\n\n\n\u201cEach piece of equipment takes several visits to the doctor for letters and prescriptions, phone calls to the insurance company, appeals for anything that is denied - which often happens - and finding the money to pay for the percentage the insurance company will not pay,\u201d Feeney said.\n\nThe cost of home health aides and nurses is substantial but these services are equally as important as the having the equipment, Feeney said. Finding an insurance company willing to cover these services is tough, she said.\n\n\"Personally, I think it is vital that parents make it a point to pinpoint exactly what is covered as far as respite care within the plans available,\" said Feeney, who has two other children, ages 10 and 11. \"Caring for a profoundly disabled child alone while caring for other children and fighting to get the medical equipment and services that Brianna needs is exhausting. I know that parents like me need help on a daily basis or it can be difficult to continue to advocate effectively.\"\n\nAlthough Brianna is covered by her father\u2019s insurance, she is shopping around for her own coverage with her daughter\u2019s needs in mind. \"I have to constantly look ahead and make sure that I have adequate health insurance for Brianna given her extraordinary needs that are only increasing as she gets older,\" she said.\n\n\n\nThe website has been a comfort, she said.\n\n\n\n\u201cI have found it really useful in deciphering the often mysterious terminology used when describing the health insurance services, processes and coverage,\u201d Feeney said. \u201cI'm finding it helpful to not feel so alone through the process of picking health insurance -- a really crucial decision that will impact Brianna's life for year's to come.\u201d\n\nA video made by Children's Specialized Hospital that explains how to use the website may be found here.\n\nSusan K.
