Later in the address he claimed that allowing same-sex marriage is harmful to children, ignoring the vast scientific evidence to the contrary.\n\n\u201cNational policies have sown confusion about the very definition of family,\u201d said Perkins, whose religious right organization is classified as a hate group by the progressive Southern Poverty Law Center. \u201cPresident Obama has extolled the virtues of fatherhood even as he has fought for same-sex marriage, in essence saying two same-gendered persons can parent as well as a mom and a dad. This contradictory message is more than disappointing. For our children throughout the country, it is devastating. It reduces mothers and fathers to genderless caregivers. Our children deserve better: They deserve a mom and a dad.\n\n\u201cAnd we pay a price for this incoherent, ideological campaign by havoc in our homes and blood in our streets. That\u2019s why we have to reempower American parents. The decision of our courts on contraception for minors, abortion on demand and redefining marriage have gravely weakened the family.\u201d\n\nHe wrongly characterized the LGBT-inclusive Houston ordinance, now repealed by voters, as a law that would have provided \u201cspecial rights to some, based on their sexual behavior and identity, at the expense of others.\u201d He praised minister Hernan Castano, one of the pastors whose sermons were subpoenaed by the city as part of a complicated legal case involving the ordinance, for standing against the \u201ctyrannical overreach\u201d of government. (The subpoenas were eventually dropped.)\n\nHe further voiced support for the First Amendment Defense Act, a federal bill that would provide exemptions from antidiscrimination law for businesses, nonprofit groups, and individuals opposed to marriage equality on religious grounds. Several Republican presidential candidates have endorsed it.\n\nWatch Perkins\u2019s speech below.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Along with making that preposterous claim in his State of the Family speech, he called the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance a 'special rights' law.", "og": {"image": "http://www.advocate.com/sites/advocate.com/files/2016/01/13/tony-perkins-x750_0_0.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-01-13T20:38:55-05:00", "type": "article", "title": "WATCH: Tony Perkins Blames Marriage Equality for 'Blood in Our Streets'"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Advocate", "fb": {"page_id": 19799718480, "app_id": 625763650825412, "pages": 6030918854}, "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-13T20:36:49-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-13T20:36:49-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe Supreme Court dismissed the natural and universal meaning of marriage,\u201d Perkins said of last summer\u2019s marriage equality decision.\nFamily Research Council president Tony Perkins, in his so-called State of the Family address Monday night, blamed marriage equality for \u201cblood in our streets\u201d and decried the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance as a \u201cspecial rights\u201d law.\nAlong with making that preposterous claim in his State of the Family speech, he called the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance a 'special rights' law.\n\u201cAnd we pay a price for this incoherent, ideological campaign by havoc in our homes and blood in our streets.\nHe further voiced support for the First Amendment Defense Act, a federal bill that would provide exemptions from antidiscrimination law for businesses, nonprofit groups, and individuals opposed to marriage equality on religious grounds."}
