They may have a losing season so far, but the San Francisco 49ers are winning in another way. Catching a game at San Francisco’s Levi’s Stadium costs fans more than at any other stadium in the country, according to the Fan Cost Index compiled by Team Marketing Report.

The index includes the cost of four average-price tickets, two cheapest draft beers, four cheapest soft drinks, four cheapest hot dogs, parking for one car, two programs and two least expensive adult caps. In San Francisco, that amounts to $640.

The $1.2 billion Levi’s Stadium opened last fall and seats 68,500 fans. The stadium will host the Super Bowl this February.

The Dallas Cowboys’ home field, AT&T Stadium, ranks as the second-most expensive place to catch a game. The rest of the top five most expensive teams to see at home are the New York Giants ($629.62), the New England Patriots ($624.70) and the Chicago Bears ($601.20).

The average cost for a family of four to see a game at any NFL stadium is $480.89, including food, drink, parking, programs and caps. That represents a 0.5 percent increase over last year.

Part of the reason NFL teams can charge so much is that there are so few games. Professional football teams play just once a week and have a relatively short season compared to basketball or baseball.

At the other end of the spectrum, the cheapest teams to see play at home are the Jacksonville Jaguars ($347.60), the Tampa Bay Buccaneers ($373.76) and the Buffalo Bills ($391.04).
