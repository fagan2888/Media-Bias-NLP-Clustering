Few proposals in Governor Raimondo’s budget have sparked a more heated debate than her proposed “Obamacare tax.”

The tax – technically, a “health reform assessment” fee – is the mechanism she’s settled on to pay for HealthSource RI, the state-run health insurance marketplace that Governor Chafee created to implement President Obama’s Affordable Care Act locally. The federal government paid the startup costs for HealthSource RI – to the tune of nearly $170 million at last count – but it’s up to the states to figure out how to pay to keep it operating going forward.

When the Affordable Care Act was passed, top Democrats in Washington assumed most states would set up their own marketplaces (also known as exchanges). But the enormous political backlash against the law led more than half the states to refuse, so they’re using the federal HealthCare.gov website instead.

Rhode Island, though, is one of 14 states that opted for the original plan and set up its own, locally-run exchange. And that means the state has to come up with its own way to pay the tab for HealthSource RI, which has 33,000 enrollees and also serves as a sign-up portal for Medicaid.

Not that Rhode Island has been immune from the mixed emotions surrounding Obamacare; a significant number of state lawmakers, up to and including Democratic House Speaker Nicholas Mattiello, have questioned whether the state should bother keeping (and paying for) HealthSource RI rather than default back to HealthCare.gov. But the Raimondo administration has come down firmly in favor of retaining HealthSource RI.

Neither option is free.

To pay for HealthCare.gov, the federal government calculates a 3.5% “user fee” on all health plans sold on the exchange – but then spreads the cost of the assessment across all similar health plans, including those sold off the exchange, which reduces the amount of the charge on each one.

To pay for HealthSource RI, Article 28 of Raimondo’s budget proposes charging two different assessment rates starting Jan. 1: a 4.7% assessment on all individual health plans sold in Rhode Island, and a 1% assessment on all small-group health plans sold in the state. That generates more money than the HealthCare.gov assessment would.

Another difference between the two: Raimondo’s assessment rate would be set annually by the secretary of health and human services – currently Elizabeth Roberts – at whatever level is necessary to generate enough money to cover HealthSource RI’s budget, and the rates for small group plans versus individual ones will be apportioned by their share of total HealthSource RI enrollment. (Note that an executive-branch official, not lawmakers, would have the power to set the rate.) The Obama administration’s regulations reserve the right to change the fee as necessary, too, but so far it’s been kept at 3.5% for three years.

Confused yet?

A new brief from Steve Whitney’s Senate Fiscal Office team makes things a little clearer. Here’s a graphic they worked up to show how much the two assessments would generate in Rhode Island, based on HealthSource’s projections that Rhode Island’s health-insurance market will sell 39,000 individual plans and 63,000 small-group plans in 2016:

As you can see, once you get through all the complicated math of how the fees work, Raimondo’s proposed HealthSource RI assessment is projected to cost Rhode Islanders 66% more than the HealthCare.gov assessment, or an extra $4.7 million, in its first year (2016).

The key difference is between the “official” rates: 3.5% for HealthCare.gov and 1%/4.7% for HealthSource RI. Nobody actually pays 3.5% for HealthCare.gov, because the cost gets spread out among all health plans, even those off the exchange, which lowers the effective rate paid by each plan. The HealthSource RI assessment, by comparison, calculates its 1% or 4.7% fee off all health plans to begin with, so the effective rate is the same.

Here’s how the Senate Fiscal Office put that in chart form:

To simplify things a little, here are two charts I made comparing just the effective assessment rates that would be added to Rhode Island’s individual and small-group plans to pay for each version of the Obamacare marketplace:

(In reality, of course, there is no “2015” fee since it’s not being charged this year – but those charts show how much Senate Fiscal estimates it would come to at current enrollment levels.)

When all is said and done, HealthSource RI is seeking an annual budget of a bit more than $11 million. The question is whether that’s more than Rhode Island’s individual and small-group health plans would have to pay if the state switched to HealthCare.gov instead. Here’s what Senate Fiscal says about the cost of switching:

The option for the State to transition from a state-based exchange to the federal exchange remains open. HSRI reports that the State would incur one-time costs of $2.7 million in both FY2017 and FY2018 to transition to the federal exchange. Ongoing costs associated with the federal exchange include a 3.5 percent federal assessment on policies sold within the exchange, which totals $8.6 million at enrollment levels assumed for FY2017 and FY2018, as well as $240,000 in ongoing state costs.

Add all that together – $8.6 million in assessment fees, $2.7 million in one-time transition costs, $240,000 in ongoing state costs – and voilà, the cost of joining HealthCare.gov in the 2016-17 budget year is about $11.5 million. That’s slightly more than the $11.2 million HealthSource RI says it will need to operate in the same year.

(Another interesting statistic in the Senate Finance brief: Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Rhode Island says its annual premiums already include an average of $432 in federal and state taxes this year, even before any HealthSource RI/HealthCare.gov assessment gets added.)

All this leaves lots of unanswered questions. Would the $2.7 million in transition costs to join HealthCare.gov last for more than two fiscal years? How likely is it the next president keeps the HealthCare.gov assessment at 3.5%? (Or keeps the Affordable Care Act at all?) Will HealthSource RI’s budget grow, shrink or stay around $11 million down the line? How many large employers, if any, will use HealthSource RI once they’re allowed to join in 2017? And will the coming decision in King v. Burwell mean Rhode Islanders can’t get insurance subsidies unless the state keeps HealthSource RI?

Another question: how solid are HealthSource RI’s enrollment projections? The exchange’s current forecast calls for small-group enrollment to jump by a whopping 220% in 2016 – from 3,282 enrollees currently to 10,515 – and then by another 38% in 2017. The HealthCare.gov assessment would be lower if enrollment falls short of those projections, since the federal fee is driven by the number of plans sold in the marketplace – which would likely make HealthSource RI more expensive.

Cost, of course, is just one piece of the HealthSource RI debate. Christine Ferguson, its founding executive director, often made the case that a state-based marketplace would give state officials more power to push for beneficial changes in the medical sector overall.

“More than just an online health insurance marketplace, HealthSource RI is envisioned as a driver of healthcare reform through negotiating lower-cost insurance options for individuals and small businesses, increasing accountability through new quality measures for plans and providers, and providing industry-wide transparency of costs and prices,” Senate Fiscal says. “It will allow for broader regulatory authority over the health insurance market and will support larger health care system reform goals.”

Lawmakers now have to decide whether they want to pay for that.
