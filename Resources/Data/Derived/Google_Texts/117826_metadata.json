Trailing 17-9, the Bears rambled down the field late in the fourth quarter.\n\nQuarterback Jay Cutler, a candidate for NFL comeback player of the year, threatened to provide a whoopee cushion to Brock Osweiler\u2019s stellar starting debut. Down 17-15 with 29 seconds remaining, the Bears needed a two-point conversion to force overtime.\n\nWhere most saw frayed nerves, the Broncos saw answers. The way Broncos cornerback Chris Harris explained it, the Bears used their best plays to cover 65 yards in 80 seconds.\n\n\u201cWe had an idea of what they were going to do,\u201d Harris said.\n\nWith former Broncos offensive coordinator Adam Gase pulling the strings for Chicago, Denver settled on two options. The Bears lined up with three receivers split left and one split right, leaving the Broncos expecting a pick play with the wideouts or a rush by rookie Jeremy Langford.\n\nLangford had just scored from a similar distance seconds earlier. Safety T.J. Ward filed it away as Langford stood next to Cutler. When the quarterback handed Langford the football, Ward darted into the hole, smashing into the Bears running back.\n\nReview proved unnecessary. The collective groan of the crowd revealed the outcome.\n\n\u201cI am not going to get into schemes and what we are doing schematically,\u201d said Bears coach John Fox, who led the Broncos to four consecutive division titles before mutually parting ways after last season\u2019s home playoff loss to the Indianapolis Colts. \u201cObviously we came up short.\u201d\n\nFox became irritated during his news conference. The Bears squandered multiple scoring chances, including a fourth down on the 4-yard line. But the failed two-point try stood out for its lack of success and imagination.\n\n\u201cYeah if you pay attention to what we do, we have a lot of (options) in our offense in every single down, not just two-point plays,\u201d Fox said. \u201cSometimes we execute. Sometimes we don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThe Broncos bent again, yielding 347 yards, their second-highest total of the season. Officials flagged the defense for 93 yards in penalties. And yet, when the Broncos needed a stop the defense rediscovered its identity in the 28-degree chill. Danny Trevathan intercepted Cutler and Malik Jackson recovered a fumble for the team\u2019s first takeaways since an Oct. 18 victory at Cleveland.\n\n\u201cI am an honorary member of the \u2018No Fly Zone'\u201d said Jackson, whose takeaway appeared to be an interception, but was listed as a fumble recovery in official stats. \u201cI caught the ball like T.J. and I ran like C.J. (Anderson).\u201d\n\nDenver made two sacks, including Derek\u2019s Wolfe first. The Broncos own 34 this season. The rush wasn\u2019t necessary on the final play. The Broncos needed force in the middle. Denver showed a soft underbelly in recent weeks, allowing three of the past four opponents to eclipse 100 yards rushing.\n\nThe Bears finished with 86 yards rushing on 25 carries. And little from Langford on the final push.\n\n\u201cThey got a good situation to get in the red zone, and when it was time for us to line up, we made a big play,\u201d Trevathan said. \u201cWe work so hard, so when stuff happens like that, we know why.\u201d\n\nTroy E.
