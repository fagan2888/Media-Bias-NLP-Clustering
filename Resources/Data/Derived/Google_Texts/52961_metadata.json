How can you print these things if you can\u2019t prove them?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in news, you moron,\u201d the publisher replies ominously. \u201cI don\u2019t have to prove it. I just have to print it.\u201d\n\nI thought this was a pretty funny line, mostly because I know it to be completely the opposite of my experience.\n\nIn fact, most of the working journalists I know go to great lengths to prove things. They resort to legal means to obtain documents. They read through dry Congressional Budget Office reports to discern whether Obamacare will, in fact, cost people jobs. (It won\u2019t.)\n\nBut, most important, they risk personal safety to tell the stories powerful forces do not want told.\n\nThere were 78 assaults against journalists in Egypt between August 2012 and July 2013.\n\nThirty-six journalists have been murdered in Russia since 1992 -\u2013 two last year. No one has been brought to justice in 32 of those cases.\n\nIn Syria, at least 29 journalists were killed in 2013; 30 more remain unaccounted for.\n\nThe list, compiled by the Committee to Protect Journalists on its \u201cRisk List,\u201d goes on, meandering through Vietnam, Turkey, Bangladesh, Liberia, Ecuador and Zambia.\n\nI guess my point is that as amusing as fiction can be, it often worries me that people believe it. They watch \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d (Netflix) and believe all politicians are venal (not to mention capable of murder), or that women reporters routinely sleep with their sources for information.\n\nThey watch \u201cThe Newsroom\u201d (HBO) and believe that reporters are either lazy or heroic. Or at least annoying, which actually is often true.\n\nThey watch \u201cSherlock\u201d and believe newspaper publishers patterned after moguls like Rupert Murdoch not only employ journalists who hack phones (which, once again, is sometimes so), but also that they will bring down the Queen if need be.\n\nIt\u2019s all very enjoyable if you remember that it is fiction. Reality, as always, is so much more sobering. If you doubt this, read the names on the CPJ site.\n\nThen you can forgive me for spoiling \u201cSherlock\u201d for you.", "article_metadata": {"description": "SPOILER ALERT: I am about to reveal at least one of the developments that unspooled on last week\u2019s finale of the brutally short season of \u201cSherlock\u201d On PBS.", "pubdate": 20140207, "og": {"site_name": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "SPOILER ALERT: I am about to reveal at least one of the developments that unspooled on last week\u2019s finale of the brutally short season of \u201cSherlock\u201d On PBS.", "title": "Gwen\u2019s Take: Don\u2019t believe everything you see on \u2018Sherlock\u2019", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Sherlock.jpg", "url": "http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/gwens-take-dont-believe-everything-see-sherlock/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "SPOILER ALERT: I am about to reveal at least one of the developments that unspooled on last week\u2019s finale of the brutally short season of \u201cSherlock\u201d On PBS.", "title": "Gwen\u2019s Take: Don\u2019t believe everything you see on \u2018Sherlock\u2019", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Sherlock.jpg", "creator": "@newshour", "site": "@newshour", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"app_id": 114150878604116}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newshour", "tag": "GWEN'S TAKE"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "GWEN'S TAKE"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd9ea\"", "article_summary": "In fact, most of the working journalists I know go to great lengths to prove things.\nThey watch \u201cSherlock\u201d and believe newspaper publishers patterned after moguls like Rupert Murdoch not only employ journalists who hack phones (which, once again, is sometimes so), but also that they will bring down the Queen if need be.\nI guess my point is that as amusing as fiction can be, it often worries me that people believe it.\nThey watch \u201cThe Newsroom\u201d (HBO) and believe that reporters are either lazy or heroic.\nSherlock objects."}
