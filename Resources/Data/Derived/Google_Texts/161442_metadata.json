Newdow claims the motto is a violation of his religious freedom.\n\nIn placing the motto \u201cIn God We Trust\u201d on American currency, the US government has \u201csubstantially burdened\u201d atheists and others \u201cto personally bear a religious message that is the antithesis of what they consider to be religious truth,\u201d the lawsuit claims on behalf of 41 plaintiffs, including parents, children, and atheist groups and individuals.\n\nNewdow \u2014 who is also an attorney \u2014 has unsuccessfully sought to have the phrase removed before. But in those attempts, his argument relied on the First Amendment protection from the governmental establishment of religion. This time, Newdow is basing his case on the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, or RFRA, a 1993 law designed to protect the exercise of free religion.\n\nThis challenge is significant because it adopts the same argument employed by Hobby Lobby in its successful battle against the Affordable Care Act in 2014. In that case \u2014 Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores \u2014 the Christian owners of Hobby Lobby claimed that RFRA prevented the government from requiring them to provide certain health care services, such as some forms of birth control, to their employees because those contraceptives violated their Christian faith. The Supreme Court ruled 5-4 in Hobby Lobby\u2019s favor.\n\nBut will courts do the same for Newdow?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGarrett Epps, a professor of law at the University of Baltimore who writes about constitutional law for The Atlantic, is skeptical. He said he is \u201cmystified\u201d by the argument that \u201cIn God We Trust\u201d is a burden on religious freedom.\n\n\u201cIt is hard for me to see how \u2026 having a nickel in your pocket is a terrible burden on your religious practices,\u201d he said. \u201cUnless Michael Newdow can explain that to me, it is hard to see him getting anywhere with this.\u201d\n\nIn the case filing, Newdow devotes six pages to arguing that \u201cIn God We Trust\u201d is a burden to atheists and other nonbelievers. He argues the phrase is based on the Bible, a book the plaintiffs do not believe in, and that is amounts to a statement of belief that is \u201cthe antithesis of the Plaintiffs\u2019 religious ideals.\u201d\n\nNewdow first challenged \u201cIn God We Trust\u201d about 10 years ago. A federal judge then rejected his argument, saying the phrase is more a secular motto than a religious affirmation.\n\nNewdow has also unsuccessfully challenged the use of \u201cSo help me God\u201d in the presidential oath of office, which a federal judge rejected on similar grounds \u2014 that it is more secular than religious.\n\nIn 2004, Newdow argued before the Supreme Court for the removal of \u201cunder God\u201d in the Pledge of Allegiance on the grounds that its recitation by his daughter in school violated his freedom as an atheist. In an unusual move, Newdow presented his own case in oral arguments, in the case known as Elk Grove Unified School District v. Newdow. Court-watchers at the time generally gave him glowing reviews for his performance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut he lost that case, too, on what justices call \u201cstanding\u201d \u2014 that because he was not the custodial parent of his daughter, he did not have legal grounds for bringing the case.\n\n\u201cIn God We Trust\u201d first appeared on American coins in 1864, at the height of the Civil War. President Lincoln\u2019s secretary of the Treasury, Salmon Chase, acted after receiving a letter from a Pennsylvania minister seeking some recognition of God in a national motto.\n\nCongress voted to place the phrase on all US currency in 1955 \u2014 in the middle of the Cold War against \u201cgodless communism,\u201d the same time \u201cunder God\u201d first appeared in the pledge. Different groups and individuals have been contesting both for decades, but none as relentlessly as Newdow.\n\nIt is hard for me to see how ... having a nickel in your pocket is a terrible burden on your religious practices.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there is any question that I am right,\u201d Newdow told RNS in 2010. \u201cI am going to keep fighting, hopefully winning, and getting the government to do what it is supposed to do, which is (provide) equal protection for all religious views.\u201d\n\nKimberly Winston is a national correspondent for RNS.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.cruxnow.com/faith/2016/01/20/atheist-seeks-removal-of-god-from-us-currency-again/", "image": "http://www.cruxnow.com/wp-content/themes/crux/library/images/favicons/favicon-200.png", "type": "article", "description": "A California atheist who once argued against the Pledge of Allegiance is challenging the phrase \"In God We Trust\" on US currency.", "title": "Atheist seeks removal of \u2018God\u2019 from US currency \u2013 again"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#d1d2d3", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.cruxnow.com/wp-content/themes/crux/images/win8-tile-icon.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "A California atheist who once argued against the Pledge of Allegiance before the Supreme Court has launched a federal legal challenge to the phrase \u201cIn God We Trust\u201d on American currency.\nHe said he is \u201cmystified\u201d by the argument that \u201cIn God We Trust\u201d is a burden on religious freedom.\n\u201cIn God We Trust\u201d first appeared on American coins in 1864, at the height of the Civil War.\nIt is hard for me to see how ... having a nickel in your pocket is a terrible burden on your religious practices.\nA federal judge then rejected his argument, saying the phrase is more a secular motto than a religious affirmation."}
