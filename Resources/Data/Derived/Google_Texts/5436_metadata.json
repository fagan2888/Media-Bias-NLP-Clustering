In reverse order of popularity:\n\n5. Leaked doc: Michelle Nunn non-profit validated grants to charity with Hamas-tied affiliate, July 28\n\nThe lede:\n\nThe National Review got hold of a 144-page internal document drafted for the Michelle Nunn campaign in December. It includes plenty of juicy revelations on campaign strategy, including a potentially serious issue with a Points of Light connection to a charity that has ties to Hamas, which is now at war with Israel. The revelation came from an internal examination of the nascent campaign\u2019s potential weaknesses and how Republicans could attack them.\n\nThis was the first of many posts about the infamous \u201cNunn memo\u201d \u2014 the internal strategy document that the campaign inadvertently posted online and caught the attention of Republican researchers, who fed it to the National Review. The Islamic Relief USA piece \u2014 which, as the above post explains, was rather convoluted \u2014 was boiled down to \u201cPoints of Light funds terrorists\u201d in a widely lambasted David Perdue ad against Nunn.\n\n4. Emory backtracks: DeKalb never threatened sewer cutoff over Ebola virus, Oct. 14\n\nThe lede:\n\nUpdated at 2:30 p.m.: Emory University just issued a statement backtracking on a claim made in today\u2019s New York Times, that DeKalb County had threatened to cut off sewer lines if it wasn\u2019t satisfied over the disposal of waste from two patients being treated for the Ebola virus.\n\nAh, the heady days of Ebola panic. The original morning post quoted from a New York Times story saying that when Emory University Hospital housed Ebola patients in August, DeKalb County threatened to cut off sewer lines, and pizza parlors refused to deliver to the hospital. By afternoon, the hospital declared it was \u201cmistaken\u201d about DeKalb\u2019s threat, but one pizza vendor did refuse delivery early on.\n\n3. Six reasons why Republicans won big in Georgia, Nov. 5\n\nThe lede:\n\nWhat was long expected to be tight elections at the top of the ticket turned into resounding victories Tuesday night for Gov. Nathan Deal and Republican Senate hopeful David Perdue. Here\u2019s a look at six key factors that helped them win decisively:\n\nList-icles are so gimmicky, aren\u2019t they?\n\n2. Top weather guy to those who talk of \u2018unexpected\u2019 Snowjam: \u2018Wrong, wrong, and wrong!\u2019 Jan. 29\n\nThe lede:\n\nAbove is a YouTube clip of Al Roker of NBC\u2019s \u201cToday,\u201d calling out Gov. Nathan Deal and Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed this morning on what Roker termed a reluctant response to Tuesday\u2019s [paralyzing] snow. Roker\u2019s not alone. Marshall Shepherd, a University of Georgia professor and president of the American Meteorological Society, just published a blog post that puts on notice those public officials who have described themselves as surprised by Tuesday\u2019s snow\n\nSnowjam is one memory we don\u2019t really want to relive.\n\n1. On new gun law\u2019s first day, a draw-down in Valdosta\n\nThe lede:\n\nThe Valdosta Daily Times reports today that, on the first day of Georgia\u2019s new law expanding the right to carry, we had a pair of gun-toting firearm enthusiasts \u2013 one of whom wasn\u2019t sure that the fellow in front of him was a good guy with a gun:\n\nGeorgia\u2019s so-called guns everywhere law earned a lot of national attention, and this post ricocheted around the Interwebs quickly.\n\nThanks to all who helped us shatter traffic records at the Insider this year.
