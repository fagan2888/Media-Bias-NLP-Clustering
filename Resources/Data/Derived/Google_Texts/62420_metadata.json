What do you think of Speaker Boehner having President Obama \u2018whip votes\u2019 from the White House in order to pass this bill?\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nIt stinks to high heaven. Did arrogant politicians not get the memo that Obama\u2019s agenda was decisively defeated in last month\u2019s historic midterm landslide? Good Lord, America said loud and clear not just \u201cno\u201d but \u201chell no\u201d to Obama\u2019s failed policies. Americans who pay attention said absolutely no to Obama\u2019s amnesty for illegal aliens.\n\nWe also said no to the mother-of-all unfunded mandates, Obamacare, and voters believed promises that they would ratchet down the $18 trillion debt. Well, our bad for apathetically trusting politicians. No, on second thought, it\u2019s not \u201cour bad.\u201d Some of us warned and worked hard to elect candidates who would buck the status quo. Many conscientious Americans did all they could to open the eyes of low-information voters. It was tough going up against Obama\u2019s lapdogs in the media and the power liberals have to play their politics of personal destruction against commonsense conservatives.\n\nBut really how out-of-touch do these politicians have to be to misunderstand our recent mandate to stop Barack Obama\u2019s fundamental transformation of the greatest nation on earth?\n\n2. Only 162 Republicans voted for this bill\u2013a bill that will take decision making away from a Republican controlled Congress in 4 weeks\u2013does that strike you as outrageous?\n\nIt\u2019s baffling really. The Republican Leadership in the House just flipped American voters the bird by sidelining the new Congress we just elected. I want the names of all 162 yahoos who would squander the opportunity to respect the will of the people and get America on the right track. Please print their names so we can ask them, \u201cWhat the heck are you thinking?!\u201d\n\nAnd thank you to the 67 House Republicans who did vote no. Let\u2019s remind everyone of their names also.\n\n3. Do you believe that the 162 Republicans that voted for the bill will face a backlash by conservatives?\n\nHope so! I\u2019ll do my part and I call upon every citizen to do their civic duty to save our country. It\u2019s easy; understand RINO season opens soon and don\u2019t hold back.\n\n4. Do you believe that Speaker Boehner working with President Obama effectively tried to \u2018nullify\u2019 the sweeping Republican victory in the 2014 mid-terms?\n\nThat\u2019s the result thus far, so yes. This is an example of the GOP establishment campaigning one way and then governing another. It\u2019s quite nauseating. They promised they would do everything in their power to stop Obama\u2019s executive amnesty \u2013 I heard their darn campaign speeches promising to do so! \u2013 and yet when they have the power to do so (power that we the voters just gave them) they tacitly endorse Obama\u2019s failed agenda. They\u2019re shining that boot that liberals have on the neck of our economy. They\u2019re carrying Barack Obama\u2019s water even more so than Nancy Pelosi if you can believe it.\n\n5. Do you think John Boehner should be re-elected Speaker of the House given his actions over the pass few days?\n\nConstitutional conservatives who understand government\u2019s balance of power and the grave danger in Obama\u2019s lawlessness, and those of us who want smart and principled leadership, should be perplexed and disappointed if stale leadership is re-elected, considering that the midterm election was all about \u201cthe status quo has got to go.\u201d It\u2019s time for new energy and steel-spined commitment to stop Obama\u2019s bizarre behavior against this country! Surely there are more of us than not who know that our Founders\u2019 memory, our vets, and our children deserve better that what we\u2019re underneath today. Keep the faith that there are more of us than there are of them who think broken campaign promises and a broken government are just dandy.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Exclusive\u2013Palin on Obama/Boehner Cromnibus Bill: 'It Stinks to High Heaven'", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Exclusive\u2013Palin on Obama/Boehner Cromnibus Bill: 'It Stinks to High Heaven'", "title": "Exclusive\u2013Palin on Obama/Boehner Cromnibus Bill: 'It Stinks to High Heaven' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 475, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2014/12/sarah-palin-fnc-ap.jpg", "height": 356}, "updated_time": "2014-12-19T08:46:27-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2014/12/12/exclusive-palin-on-obama-boehner-cromnibus-bill-it-stinks-to-high-heaven/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Exclusive\u2013Palin on Obama/Boehner Cromnibus Bill: 'It Stinks to High Heaven'", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2014/12/sarah-palin-fnc-ap.jpg", "title": "Exclusive\u2013Palin on Obama/Boehner Cromnibus Bill: 'It Stinks to High Heaven' - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": ",Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "published_time": "2014-12-12T05:50:04-07:00", "categories": "Big Government", "modified_time": "2014-12-19T08:46:27-07:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd442\"", "article_summary": "!\u201dAnd thank you to the 67 House Republicans who did vote no.\nThey promised they would do everything in their power to stop Obama\u2019s executive amnesty \u2013 I heard their darn campaign speeches promising to do so!\nWhat do you think of Speaker Boehner having President Obama \u2018whip votes\u2019 from the White House in order to pass this bill?\nDo you think John Boehner should be re-elected Speaker of the House given his actions over the pass few days?\nDid arrogant politicians not get the memo that Obama\u2019s agenda was decisively defeated in last month\u2019s historic midterm landslide?"}
