(iStockPhoto)\n\nWe all knew bacon contained unhealthy amounts of fat, plenty of salt and lots of cholesterol. But now the World Health Organization is saying that it \u2013 and other processed meats, like hot dogs \u2013 will even cause cancer.\n\nThe International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), an arm of the WHO, said Monday that evidence suggests processed meats are far worse for us than we initially believed. The agency also determined that, based on limited evidence, the consumption of red meat was \u201cprobably carcinogenic to humans.\u201d\n\nAccording to experts, each 50 gram portion of processed meat eaten daily can increase the risk of cancer by 18 percent.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor an individual, the risk of developing colorectal cancer because of their consumption of processed meat remains small, but the risk increases with the amount of meat consumed,\u201d said Dr. Kurt Straif, head of the IARC Monographs Program. \u201cIn view of the large number of people who consume processed meat, the global impact on cancer incidence is of public health importance.\u201d\n\nWhile consumption of meat varies widely from country to country, Dr. Christopher Wild, Director of IARC, said that the findings from over 800 studies in the last 20 years analyzing the association of processed meats with cancer back up assertions that people should limit meat consumption.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, red meat has nutritional value,\u201d Wild said. \u201cTherefore, these results are important in enabling governments and international regulatory agencies to conduct risk assessments, in order to balance the risks and benefits of eating red meat and processed meat.\u201d\n\nThe $95 billion beef industry in the U.S. saw the conclusion coming and prepared for the findings with a response of its own.\n\n\u201cWe simply don\u2019t think the evidence support any causal link between any red meat and any type of cancer,\u201d Shalene McNeill, executive director of human nutrition at the National Cattlemen\u2019s Beef Association, told The Washington Post.\n\nComplicating things further, the American Cancer Society has noted that many studies find \u201ca link\u201d between cancer and consumption of red meat, but they\u2019re not sure.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Health Care News [News]", "title": "Bacon Might Cause Cancer", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Everyone loves bacon, but it might be a cause of cancer according to the World Health Organization.", "title": "Bacon Might Cause Cancer", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2015/10/26/bacon-might-cause-cancer", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/09/c4083b724cabcba399f5a47f4b1626/36299FE_PR_121220bacon.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "Everyone loves bacon, but it might be a cause of cancer according to the World Health Organization.", "card": "summary", "title": "Bacon Might Cause Cancer"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "news", "date_published": "Oct. 26, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Max Miceli,Pulse,cancer,picks,World Health Organization,food and drink,Health Care News [News]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Everyone loves bacon, but it might be a cause of cancer according to the World Health Organization."}, "article_summary": "But now the World Health Organization is saying that it \u2013 and other processed meats, like hot dogs \u2013 will even cause cancer.\nComplicating things further, the American Cancer Society has noted that many studies find \u201ca link\u201d between cancer and consumption of red meat, but they\u2019re not sure.\nThe International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), an arm of the WHO, said Monday that evidence suggests processed meats are far worse for us than we initially believed.\n(iStockPhoto)We all knew bacon contained unhealthy amounts of fat, plenty of salt and lots of cholesterol.\n\u201cAt the same time, red meat has nutritional value,\u201d Wild said."}
