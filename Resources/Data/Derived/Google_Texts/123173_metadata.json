Putin waved away the urgent rhetoric from Washington about a Russian invasion of the Crimean Peninsula, saying that he had already ordered troops near the region back to their bases. The masked, armed men who look so much like Russian special forces patrolling the streets in Crimea, Putin explained, are just local fighters who have taken to the streets to defend the Russian majority population. But the real troops might show up again, Putin said. Why? Because he wants to protect democracy. From Reuters: \u201c\u2018There can be only one assessment of what happened in Kiev, in Ukraine in general. This was an anti-constitutional coup and the armed seizure of power,\u2019 said Putin, looking relaxed as he sat before a small group of reporters at his residence near Moscow. \u2018As for bringing in forces. For now there is no such need but such a possibility exists,\u2019 he said. \u2018What could serve as a reason to use military force? It would naturally be the last resort, absolutely the last.\u2019\u201d\n\nTime is on his side - This doesn\u2019t sound like a guy who is smarting from President Obama\u2019s ruling Monday that Russia was \u201con the wrong side of history.\u201d Obama, talking to reporters with visiting Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu, whittled down some of his tougher talk from Friday, saying that \u201cover time\u201d Russia\u2019s incursion would be a \u201ccostly proposition.\u201d The message Putin seems to have taken is that he has time to shore up Russian control of the region before the eventual resolution. Given the international community\u2019s unwillingness to make stark determinations about such things as invasions, especially when they involve a permanent UN Security Council member that is the primary energy supplier to Western Europe, Time does seem to be on Putin\u2019s side, whatever history eventually adjudges.

John McCain, R-Ariz., discusses Ukraine in the 10 a.m. ET hour]\n\nSlide them some cash, Jack - \u201c\u2026the U.S. Administration is working with Congress and the Government of Ukraine to provide $1 billion in loan guarantees, the proceeds of which will be aimed at protecting the most vulnerable Ukrainian households from the impact of the needed economic adjustment.\u201d \u2013Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, in a statement Monday\n\n\u201cWe have created a leadership vacuum in the world, and it is being filled by the Putins of the world, by people without our values or our interest, and it\u2019s to the detriment of the United States and our friends and allies around the world, It is the United States that\u2019s injected that instability into the world equation.\u201d \u2013 Former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, \u201cOn The Record with Greta Van Susteren.\u201d Watch here.\n\n[Sen. Dan Coats, R-Ind., writes in Fox News Opinion that the U.S. needs to isolate Russia on all possible front until Putin reverses course. \u201cThat we are a diminished power is an illusion that gives Putin sparse comfort and false courage.\u201d]\n\nBAIER TRACKS: UKRAINE CASTS SHADOWS ON HILLARY\u2026\n\n\u201cVladimir Putin told reporters in Moscow this morning that the government in Ukraine is an unconstitutional coup and that he \u2018reserved the right\u2019 to use force there. This, of course, came just hours before Secretary of State John Kerry touched down in Kiev. As that real-time back-and-forth continues, the long-term political impact in Washington is beginning to sink in. Politico offers a piece on how tethered Hillary Clinton is to Obama foreign policy. After all, she is the face of the infamous \u2018reset with Russia.\u2019 And the behind-the-scenes story about that painful PR moment when Clinton presented her Russian counterpart with a novelty \u2018reset button\u2019 is actually worse than many originally thought. These could make uncomfortable questions on the 2016 campaign trail.\u201d - Bret Baier.\n\nOBAMACARE VICTIM RETURNS FIRE IN NEW AD\n\nNYT: \u201cAmericans for Prosperity, the conservative advocacy group being challenged by Democrats over the content of its ads attacking the health care law, is pushing back with a new commercial that will begin airing Tuesday in Michigan. The commercial features Julie Boonstra, a Michigan woman who was the subject of an earlier ad, in which she said she had lost the health plan that she preferred for treatment of her leukemia and was facing higher costs because of the health care law. Lawyers for Representative Gary Peters, a Democrat who is seeking Michigan\u2019s open Senate seat, wrote to television stations asking them to demand verification for the claims in the initial commercial\u2026 In the new ad, Ms. Boonstra says the attacks on her credibility have been devastating and accuses Mr. Peters of trying to silence her. \u2018All I want is to be listened to,\u2019 she says in the commercial. \u2018There are thousands of people out there who are hurting because of Obamacare.\u2019\u201d\n\n[Watch the new ad here]\n\nVULNERABLE DEMS, INSURERS WANT FAST ACTION ON OBAMACARE DELAY\n\nThe Hill says a formal announcement of a long-promised change to ObamaCare rules could come as soon as this week as Democrats brace for more backlash from cancelled policies. The change would extend the president\u2019s move to temporarily waive federal regulations that banned millions of existing individual insurance policies. The president issued the waiver after the uproar that followed the revelation that his oft-repeated \u201cif you like it, you can keep it\u201d pledge was false. From WashEx: \u201c\u2018I don\u2019t see how they could have a bunch of these announcements going out in September,\u2019 one consultant in the health insurance industry said. \u2018Not when they\u2019re trying to defend the Senate and keep their losses at a minimum in the House. This is not something to have out there right before the election.\u2019 \u2026 The administration\u2019s decision to pursue another extension was confirmed by insurance sources who predicted a public announcement would be \u2018imminent.\u2019 It is unclear how long the extension will be, though one source believed it could last to the end of Obama\u2019s second term, and perhaps beyond\u2026 Health insurers are meeting in Washington, D.C., this week for two major conferences hosted by their trade group, America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans. Several sources said they had heard chatter about an extension but that the administration had not made efforts to discuss the possibility with industry officials.\u201d\n\n[Yeah, but - The waiver may help give Democrats something to say about the false promises they made when passing and defending the law in 2010 and 2012, but it\u2019s not clear that state insurance commissioners can or will comply with this talking-point generation system. Then there\u2019s the rate hikes and employee dumping just over the horizon\u2026]\n\nPrivate alternative to ObamaCare offers more choices - Daily Caller: \u201cTwo private insurance exchanges across metropolitan areas in 45 states provide more options more cheaply than Obamacare exchanges, the National Center for Public Policy Research found\u2026 On average, both male and female 27-year-olds will have ten more options on eHealthInsurance.com than an Affordable Care Act marketplace... \u2018Obamacare supporters, including the president himself and Nancy Pelosi, claimed the exchanges would yield more choice and lower prices,\u2019 senior fellow for health policy David Hogberg said. \u2018This study shows those claims do not stand up\u2019\u2026 For 27-year-old males, 32 health insurance policies on eHealth and 38 plans on Finder were less expensive than the exchanges\u2019 cheapest policy. Young women can find 18 and 20 cheaper plans on the two exchanges respectively and for older couples, 29 and 28 plans on eHealth and Finder.\u201d\n\nCrashed ObamaCare site signed up illegals - The Oregonian: \u201cNearly 4,000 applicants for a state program that provides undocumented immigrants with pregnancy services were instead enrolled in full Oregon Health Plan coverage, contrary to federal law, thanks to problems with the Cover Oregon health insurance exchange. State officials say they discovered the problem several weeks ago and are correcting it\u2026Two thirds of Cover Oregon\u2019s enrollments -- more than 70,000 -- have gone into the low-income Oregon Health Plan, the state\u2019s version of Medicaid\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Hill: \u201cPresident Obama will reach out directly to Hispanics on the merits of the Affordable Care Act as part of the administration\u2019s final enrollment push before the March 31 deadline. The town hall event on Thursday in Washington, D.C., will be coordinated in conjunction with some of the largest Spanish-speaking media outlets in the country \u2014 Univision, Telemundo, and La Opinion-impreMedia \u2014 and will be distributed across \u2018broadcast, radio, digital and social platforms,\u2019 according to a White House official.\u201d\n\nOBAMA TO UNVEIL BASE-BOOSTER BUDGET\n\nPresident Obama today travels to a D.C. school to unveil his budget proposal for the federal fiscal year that starts Oct. 1. Now, everybody knows that Congress isn\u2019t doing any fiscal rock breaking between now and Election Day. This plan, like the Republican alternatives starting to dribble out, is about trying to win those elections. For the president, that means incentivizing his base to get out and vote. Washington Examiner has the details on Obama\u2019s vision for a future without Republican budget worrywarts, including expanding and making permanent a $60 billion-a-year program that gives tax refunds to people who don\u2019t pay federal income taxes. \u201c\u2026the budget will include an expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Child Tax Credit, as well as other tax changes to aid college students and help promote retirement savings. Although the White House did not specify the budgetary cost of its proposed programs, it said in a release that the tax breaks would be offset in the budget by raising taxes on certain high-income earners. \u2026 The main feature of the White House\u2019s plan would be to make permanent the expansion of the EITC to families with three or more children from the 2009 stimulus, and to increase the tax break even further by expanding it for childless workers\u2026 The EITC is intended to aid poor people while also encouraging work. It is a refundable tax credit that accrues to low-wage workers, phasing out with income.\u201d\n\n[Watch Fox: Sen.

And it doesn\u2019t matter what limits the Constitution puts on government officials\u2019 power if they can exceed those limits without any adverse consequences. In other words, the Constitution cannot protect you if you don\u2019t protect the Constitution with your votes against anyone who violates it.

John Cornyn after his challenger ran a campaign so disastrous that even top grassroots activists in Texas have disavowed him. Cornyn, the Senate's No. 2 Republican as minority whip, should have little trouble securing the GOP nomination Tuesday in his bid for a third term, even though some activists dismiss him as too moderate and his firebrand colleague, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, has refused to say whether he'll vote for him. Cornyn appears safe because the best-known of the seven Republicans vying to unseat him is U.S. Rep. Steve Stockman. The congressman stunned political observers when, just three months before the primary, he withdrew his re-election bid to his suburban Houston district and filed to run for Senate.\u201d\n\nCruz: I\u2019m no Mr. Congeniality - In an interview with columnist Cal Thomas, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said he would lose a \u201cMr. Congeniality\u201d contest if it were up to the Senate Republican leadership. Thomas writes: \u201cI \u2026[asked] him about his controversial move \u2026 to change Senate rules by requiring 60 votes to pass the debt ceiling increase, instead of a 51-vote majority. Cruz responded, \u2018...there is no universe in which I would be willing to consent to allow (majority leader) Harry Reid to raise the debt ceiling with no spending reforms on only 51 votes. The reaction from a significant number of my colleagues was considerable anger and dismay\u2019\u2026 \u2018That doesn\u2019t mean we need to fight on everything. You pick your battles\u2026\u201d\n\nPOLL SHOWS GOP TOPS DEMS IN STATES WITH SENATE RACES\n\nWaPo: \u201cIn the 34 states with Senate races, 50 percent of voters say they favor Republicans and 42 percent favor Democrats\u2026Just 22 percent say they are inclined to reelect their representatives in Congress. Almost seven in 10 Americans (68 percent) say they are inclined to look around for someone new this fall.\u201d\n\nHAGAN IN DECLINE, EVEN WITH DEMS\n\nA new poll from Elon University finds Sen. Kay Hagan, D-N.C., only receives 55 percent approval amongst Democrats, down from 63 in November. Overall, 49 percent of Tar Heel state voters disapprove of Hagan. This is Hagan\u2019s fourth straight drop in approval. Fifty-two percent of respondents saying they are worse off under ObamaCare, Hagan is facing a much tougher than expected re-election effort.\n\nPICK SIX: WEST VIRGINIA UNSEATS ALASKA\n\nRepublicans must add six seats to their total in the Senate to take control of the upper chamber. Which six Democrat-held seats are the most vulnerable? The consensus among Fox News First readers: Arkansas, Montana, Louisiana, South Dakota, North Carolina and West Virginia.

There are now at least 10, and potentially as many as 13, Democratic-held seats in jeopardy. By contrast, only two GOP seats are in any meaningful danger, and that number hasn\u2019t changed in six months.\u201d Cook\u2019s top 10: South Dakota, West Virginia, Montana Michigan, Iowa, Arkansas, North Carolina, Alaska, Louisiana, Colorado. His three on the bubble: Minnesota, New Hampshire and Virginia.\n\nHEY BUDDY: GRAHAM INVOKES DEMINT IN NEW AD\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., is out with a new ad in his bid the beat back a primary challenge from conservative opponents. Graham name drops former Senate colleague Jim DeMint, R-S.C., who resigned from the Senate in 2012 to take over the Heritage Foundation, a conservative political action group in Washington. The two men maintained a seemingly uneasy truce as the state\u2019s senators, deferring to each other on the state level but fighting proxy battles in other states\u2019 primaries. Graham\u2019s new ad flashes his name next to DeMint\u2019s as a narrator says, \u201che was ranked as a top five Senate budget cutter\u201d and again when the narrator says \u201che opposed ObamaCare from day one.\u201d Neither DeMint nor his organizations have yet endorsed anyone in Graham\u2019s primary.\n\nLEE LENDS SUPPORT TO SASSE\n\nTea Party favorite Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, is backing Nebraska Republican Senate hopeful Ben Sasse. Sasse, the president of Midland University, is chasing frontrunner Shane Osborn, the former state treasurer, in a bid to succeed retiring Sen. Mike Johanns, R-Neb. Lee, one of the founding members of the Senate Tea Party Caucus, was one of the first beneficiaries of the outsider surge four years ago when he ousted incumbent Sen. Bob Bennett. Lee says in a statement: \u201cNebraskans need Ben Sasse to represent their values, reformers in the Senate need his conservative vote, our country needs his voice.\u201d Lee\u2019s endorsement adds to a growing list for Sasse, including Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., Club for Growth and the Jim DeMint-founded Senate Conservatives Fund.\n\n\n\n[The Hill: Republican Shane Osborn nabbed the endorsement of social conservative leader Phyllis Schlafly in his bid for Senate in Nebraska. Schlafly, head of the anti-feminist, anti-abortion group the Eagle Forum, said in a statement obtained exclusively by The Hill that she\u2019s endorsing Osborn because the nation needs \u2018leaders with strong moral convictions.\u2019]\n\nCOCHRAN TOUTS CONSERVATIVE CRED IN AD DEBUT\n\n\u201cSen. Thad Cochran, [R-Miss.,] will launch the first television ads of his 2014 reelection bid Tuesday, moving to define his legislative record in positive terms to the GOP primary electorate, according to two sources close to the Mississippi race,\u201d Politico reports. \u201cThe incumbent senator\u2019s first wave of television advertising will feature three positive messages\u2026One spot will be a \u2018man on the street\u2019-style commercial about Cochran\u2019s accomplishments for Mississippi. Another will focus on Cochran\u2019s votes against [ObamaCare]...The third commercial, set to run along the Mississippi coast, highlights the senator\u2019s role in delivering federal aid to his state in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. The size of the buy runs into the six figures, two operatives tracking the Mississippi air war said.\u201d\n\nBOEHNER HEDGES\n\nCincinnati Enquirer: \u201c\u2026.[House Speaker John Boehner] said he is confident he can win a third term as House speaker, despite his rocky three years in the post and his narrow re-election to that leadership slot in 2013. \u2018It won\u2019t even be close,\u2019 Boehner said of his re-election as speaker during an hour long exclusive interview Monday with The Enquirer. \u2018I frankly think I\u2019m in better shape with my own caucus than I have been any time in the last three years. ... I think they understand me better.\u2019\u2026 Boehner stopped short of saying he will serve out the entire term in Congress if he is re-elected. He said only that \u2018I fully expect to serve.\u2019\u2019\u2019\n\nLET THE GOOD TIMES ROLL\u2026 ON TO THE SCALE\n\nWhile Washington is fixated on getting Americans to trim down, one Missouri candy shop is celebrating those with a little extra girth.

And [Russian President Vladimir Putin] would only have done it with a president who has shown from the very beginning that [President Obama] is living in a fantasy world\u2026They imagine the world as a new interconnected world where climate change is the biggest threat and they are shocked that the Russians actually are interested in territory.\u201d \u2013Charles Krauthammer, on \u201cSpecial Report with Bret Baier\u201d\n\nChris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News.
