She was inspired by her father, David, who regularly competes in the sport that combines swimming, biking and running. Today, it\u2019s a family affair with four of the Roberts\u2019 five kids participating. The family expects 2-year-old Josh to join in the fun when he\u2019s older.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so much more enjoyable for kids when it\u2019s three activities rolled into one,\u201d said David Roberts. \u201cThe variety suits their mentality.\u201d\n\nThe sport is growing among kids and adults, said Lindsay Wyskowski, communications manager for USA Triathlon, the governing body for triathlons held in the United States. The number of youth races sanctioned by the Colorado-based organization jumped from 193 in 2004 to 885 in 2013, she said. Adult events increased from 1,541 to 4,327 during the same period.\n\nMany kids\u2019 events are started by triathlete parents who want to introduce their children to the sport. Heightened awareness about fitness and childhood obesity, and the first appearance of triathlon in the 2000 Olympics have contributed to the sport\u2019s growing popularity, Wyskowski added.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity to have fun and be a part of something active,\u201d she said.\n\nThe kids\u2019 events usually require participants to swim between 25 and 200 yards, bike one to three miles and run up to one mile, depending on their age.\n\nWhen the Bexley Recreation and Parks Department in Ohio launched its first youth triathlon in 2013, organizers hoped to attract 75 children. The event drew more than 150, said recreation director Michael Price. He liked the idea of hosting a sporting event around swimming, biking and running because those activities are such a big part of childhood.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an everyday occurrence for most kids,\u201d he said. \u201cThey just don\u2019t put it together as a race.\u201d\n\nEleven-year-old Jacob Mansbach of Santa Barbara, California, was drawn to the sport because he likes all three elements of it.\n\n\u201cI do swim team, and I bike and run often,\u201d said Jacob, whose first race was a parent-child event that he did with his dad, Mike. He has participated in 11 more triathlons since then.\n\n\u201cI really love the energy everyone has when you\u2019re doing one,\u201d said Jacob. \u201cEverybody encourages everybody else. It\u2019s fun.\u201d\n\nHis mother, Jennifer Mansbach, sees the event as a great way for him to stay active and build self- esteem.\n\n\u201cThe kids have to rely on themselves to get to the finish line. It\u2019s important for them to set out to do something on their own and see that they can accomplish it,\u201d she said.\n\nJoe Coito, organizer of the Santa Barbara Triathlon, agrees that triathlons \u201cbuild confidence in kids unlike anything I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\n\nHe likes the parent-child event because many times it\u2019s the kids persuading their parents to participate. Parents can be more intimidated by the thought of doing a triathlon than their children are, Coito said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2015/05/hffit05.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe19aa\"", "article_summary": "They are practicing for the kids\u2019 triathlon series in their hometown of Tallahassee.\nJoe Coito, organizer of the Santa Barbara Triathlon, agrees that triathlons \u201cbuild confidence in kids unlike anything I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201dHe likes the parent-child event because many times it\u2019s the kids persuading their parents to participate.\nThe Roberts kids sometimes try putting on clothes, shoes and bike helmets while they are soaking wet from swimming in the family pool.\n\u201cThe variety suits their mentality.\u201dThe sport is growing among kids and adults, said Lindsay Wyskowski, communications manager for USA Triathlon, the governing body for triathlons held in the United States.\nToday, it\u2019s a family affair with four of the Roberts\u2019 five kids participating."}
