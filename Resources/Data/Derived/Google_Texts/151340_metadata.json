Mark Welsh sounded the alarm about the advancements Beijing and Moscow have made with their military aircraft, progress that threatens to erase Washington\u2019s vaunted technological edge.\n\nRelated: Move Over, F-35: Russia Has Raised the Stakes for Next-Generation Fighters\n\nToday, the U.S. has \u201ccouple thousand more\u201d warplanes than China, but \u201cat the rate they\u2019re building, the models they\u2019re fielding, by 2030 they will have fielded\u2014they will have made up that 2,000 aircraft gap and they will be at least as big\u2014if not bigger\u2014than our air forces,\u201d Welsh told the House Appropriations Defense subcommittee on Wednesday.\n\nBesides the number of jets, China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) today boasts 325,000 personnel, slightly more than the U.S., Beijing is rolling out new fighter variants and other advanced weaponry regularly, the four-star warned.\n\n\u201cWe are not keeping up with that kind of technology development,\u201d he told the panel. \u201cWe are still in a position of\u2014we will have the best technology in the battlespace especially if we can continue with our current big three modernization programs,\u201d including the new B-21 bomber and the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, \u201cbut they will have a lot of technology that's better than the stuff we've had before.\u201d\n\nRelated: Stealth Wars: China Rolls Out a New J-20, Another Knockoff Fighter\n\nWelsh raised the Russian specter on Thursday when he appeared before the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n\n\u201cAn Air Force that doesn't stay ahead of the technology curve will fail. Fifty-three countries today are flying Russian fighters around the world. They will export their new capabilities as they field them, and their new capabilities will be better than our old stuff,\u201d he said.\n\nTogether, the testimonies are reminiscent of the \u201cmissile gap,\u201d a Cold War phrase used by defense hawks to decry the number of missiles the Soviet Union possessed compared with the U.S. \u2013 a gap that later turned out to be bogus.\n\nWelsh, who is slated to retire this year after 40 years in the service, could be trying to get funding beyond the Air Force\u2019s proposed $120 billion budget for fiscal year 2017 by breaking down complex strategic problems -- Russia\u2019s vast military modernization push, China\u2019s emergence as a global military power \u2013 into a one-for-one competition that the U.S. has no choice but to win.\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s the New, Secret Warplane Everyone Will Soon Be Talking About\n\nAnd he seems to have a receptive audience.\n\nArmed Service Committee Chairman John McCain (R-Ariz.) kicked off Thursday\u2019s hearing by lamenting that \u201cpotential adversaries are developing and fielding fifth-generation fighters, advanced air defense systems and sophisticated space, cyber and electronic warfare capabilities that are rapidly shrinking America's military technological advance and holding our aircraft at greater risk over greater distances.\u201d\n\nWelsh\u2019s two-pronged argument, on production and technology, could prove a winning combo that sees the Air Force get some or all of the $2.85 billion \u201cwish list\u201d it recently submitted to Congress. That would allow the service to buy more F-35s and cargo aircraft, or win approval for its pricey procurement and modernization efforts.\n\nThe four-star general certainly drove home the idea that Congress shouldn\u2019t trifle with either country.\n\n\u201cThey're serious air forces, and they're serious about getting better\u2026, General Welsh told House lawmakers. \u201cNot modernizing our Air Force is not an answer that's acceptable.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The Air Force\u2019s top general is warning Congress that one day soon the U.S. might not be able to keep pace with Russia and China when it comes to producing and fielding next-generation fighter jets.", "title": "Is the US Facing a \u2018Fighter Gap\u2019 With China and Russia?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/04/US-Facing-Fighter-Gap-China-and-Russia", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/02192016_Su-30SME_jet_fighter.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/04/US-Facing-Fighter-Gap-China-and-Russia", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/02192016_Su-30SME_jet_fighter.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The Air Force\u2019s top general is warning Congress that one day soon the U.S. might not be able to keep pace with Russia and China when it comes to producing and fielding next-generation fighter jets.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The Air Force\u2019s top general is warning Congress that one day soon the U.S. might not be able to keep pace with Russia and China when it comes to producing and fielding next-generation fighter jets.\n\u201cThey're serious air forces, and they're serious about getting better\u2026, General Welsh told House lawmakers.\n\u201cNot modernizing our Air Force is not an answer that's acceptable.\u201d\nBesides the number of jets, China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) today boasts 325,000 personnel, slightly more than the U.S., Beijing is rolling out new fighter variants and other advanced weaponry regularly, the four-star warned.\n\u201cAn Air Force that doesn't stay ahead of the technology curve will fail."}
