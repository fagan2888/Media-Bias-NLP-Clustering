A “Frozen” ringtone playing “Let it Go” interrupted a Senate hearing on Thursday — and one of the panel's senators was responsible.

Sen. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) showed little sign of being embarrassed, when the familiar tune played out during the Senate Finance Committee hearing.

Laughter erupted through the hearing room, and Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack was unable to stop a smile, as he attempted to answer a question from Roberts.

“Aw, come on,” said Roberts, 78.

“Just let it go,” he told the witness to laughter. “Sorry about that.”

Roberts' office said his choice of ringtone was motivated by his grandchildren.
