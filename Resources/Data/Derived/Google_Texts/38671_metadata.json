But they\u2019re also risking the safety of their families, friends or customers, county officials say. Pulling a building permit triggers inspections and reviews that ensure compliance with building codes.\n\nIn other words, permits prevent shoddy construction.\n\nUnpermitted construction also doesn\u2019t show up on the tax rolls, depriving local governments of dollars needed for police and fire protection, schools, parks and libraries.\n\nA hotbed of this unlicensed activity appears to be the working class community of Palm River, southeast of Tampa. David Moore, an activist there, documented five houses within one or two blocks of his home that were built without proper permits.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very evident when somebody\u2019s building, sawing,\u201d Moore said, explaining how he found out about the work. \u201cI checked on these properties. It\u2019s amazing what I found.\u201d\n\nThe county\u2019s building code compliance section confirmed that building permits were never issued for additions and out-buildings at three of the homes Moore brought to the Tribune\u2019s attention. Owners of the other two houses obtained permits after the construction was started because someone had complained to code enforcement.\n\n\u201cWe advise them they can get an after-the-fact permit,\u201d said Lois Williams, manager of building code compliance for the county. \u201cWe always work with them to try to get them to come into compliance.\u201d\n\nOne of the homes where no permits were issued was 503 Winham St., where a carport was enclosed to make another room. The owner, Willie Smith, said the work occurred before he and his wife bought the house in November 2003.\n\n\u201cYou have to go back to when the house was new and go forward to know when it was put on there and whether it was legal or not,\u201d Smith said.\n\nNevertheless, Smith and the owners of the other two houses without permits were sent notices saying they needed to get them. If they ignore the warnings, the county will start to fine them after 30 days. Fines can amount to $500 per violation.\n\n\u201cThat (fine) normally prompts a response from the owner,\u201d Williams said.\n\nThe house that Moore called the \u201cmost egregious\u201d example of unlicensed activity in his neighborhood is 617 Winham, where a carport was enclosed and an entire second story built but never added to the tax rolls.\n\nA spokesman for the property appraiser\u2019s office said the property was inspected in January 2013 when the second story was unfinished so it was not listed as taxable value.\n\nMoore said construction on the house went on for years in fits and starts. He first notified the county in 2008 because the roof and siding of the house were unfinished for at least a year. Debris littered the property, and a construction storage building sat outside for several years.\n\n\u201cIt was an eyesore,\u201d Moore said. \u201cThose are only supposed to be temporary; they aren\u2019t supposed to be there for years.\u201d\n\nCounty records show the building permit for the property expired in March 2009 with construction unfinished. Impatient with the response from the county, Moore called the office of then-Commissioner Kevin White in 2010.\n\nWhite\u2019s legislative aide, Cedric McCray, came out and asked for action by the code enforcement department, which deals with zoning violations, and building code compliance, which handles building code violations.\n\nBoth departments started inspections in August 2010. Code enforcement issued seven citations for the house, some for accumulations of debris and overgrowth of weeds.\n\nOver the next two years, building code compliance dogged the owners, Margaret St. John and Lanny Priester, to complete the construction. In April 2011, St. John appeared before a special hearing master who gave the owners 90 days to get permits and inspections.\n\nIf they didn\u2019t comply, fines of $100 per day would commence July 11, 2011.\n\nFines against the owners accumulated to $2,800 by December 2011. But that same month, a special hearing master slashed the fine to $15.42. Priester paid it two weeks later.\n\nIn a phone interview, Priester called the neighbors\u2019 complaints about the house \u201ctotal BS.\u201d\n\n\u201cCode enforcement knows all about that stuff,\u201d Priester said. \u201cWhoever this SOB is needs to keep his nose in his own business. He ought to run for councilman on this street.\u201d\n\nPriester denied getting his permits \u201cafter the fact,\u201d as reported by the building department.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve done no more work,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s been going on for one or six years.\u201d\n\nHe ended the conversation abruptly.\n\nWilliams, the manager of building code compliance, said unpermitted construction happens in all neighborhoods \u2014 rich, poor, middle class. County inspectors are out looking for violations every day, she said, but they can\u2019t go on private property or look over fences without permission.\n\nFrom January to August, the building department issued $36,256 in fines for unpermitted construction, Williams said, and collected $67,829 in permit fees.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re actively out there looking and following up on all the complaints we get,\u201d she said. \u201cIf (inspectors) see it out there, they\u2019re going to issue a notice of non-compliance.\u201d\n\nmsalinero@tampatrib.com\n\n(813) 259-8303", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sat, 04 Oct 2014 18:43:08 -0400", "Description": "People all across Hillsborough County have built additions to houses and businesses without obtaining the required permits.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "People all across Hillsborough County have built additions to houses and businesses without obtaining the required permits.", "title": "Hillsborough cracks down on unpermitted building", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/county-cracks-down-on-unpermitted-building-20141004/", "image": {"width": 4000, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20141004/ARTICLE/141009510/EP/1/1/EP-141009510.jpg", "height": 2643}, "updated_time": "2014-10-04T18:44:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "People all across Hillsborough County have built additions to houses and businesses without obtaining the required permits.", "title": "Hillsborough cracks down on unpermitted building", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20141004/ARTICLE/141009510/AR/0/AR-141009510.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2014-10-04T18:43:08Z-04", "modified_time": "2014-10-04T18:44:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdce81\"", "article_summary": "White\u2019s legislative aide, Cedric McCray, came out and asked for action by the code enforcement department, which deals with zoning violations, and building code compliance, which handles building code violations.\nWilliams, the manager of building code compliance, said unpermitted construction happens in all neighborhoods \u2014 rich, poor, middle class.\n\u201cWe advise them they can get an after-the-fact permit,\u201d said Lois Williams, manager of building code compliance for the county.\nIt\u2019s amazing what I found.\u201dThe county\u2019s building code compliance section confirmed that building permits were never issued for additions and out-buildings at three of the homes Moore brought to the Tribune\u2019s attention.\nOver the next two years, building code compliance dogged the owners, Margaret St. John and Lanny Priester, to complete the construction."}
