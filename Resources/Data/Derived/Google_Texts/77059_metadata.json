When they are wheels bend, parts break and car fluids flow freely.\n\nIt's par for the course at the Low Rider Hopping Nationals at the Carl Casper Custom Auto Show, which was held at Freedom Hall, where 25 cars stood ready to compete in four categories: street class, single pump, double pump and radicals.\n\nMany of the cars couldn't make it to the center of the floor, but those that did put on an impressive show.\n\nJason Garrett, who brought his two radical cars from Ohio to compete, has been hopping at the show since 1995.\n\nRadical cars are those that have been so heavily modified that they can no longer be driven on the street. And they were by far the most impressive ones during the competition, rising higher than the other classes.\n\nTo propel the front end of a car 10 feet in the air requires an array of up to 10 batteries and a hydraulic suspension.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1EGb48i", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Two-ton cars are not meant to be slammed to the ground from 10 feet in the air.
