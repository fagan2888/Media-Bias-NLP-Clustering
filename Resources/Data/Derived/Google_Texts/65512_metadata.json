If he decided not to endorse he wouldn\u2019t schedule a press conference to say that.\n\nI suspect that U.S. Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) will get the nod as he and King have been friends, and King\u2019s son Jeff works for a PAC that backs Cruz.\n\nI also wouldn\u2019t be surprised by an endorsement of Donald Trump since he and King are aligned on immigration which is one of King\u2019s top issues. Trump has also done a number of events with King. I\u2019m pretty confident it will be Cruz.\n\nRick Santorum\u2019s position on immigration also aligns well with King\u2019s, but considering King didn\u2019t endorse him in 2012 I would be surprised to see him do so in 2016.\n\nI think the safe bet is a King endorsement of Ted Cruz however.\n\nKing endorsed the late Senator Fred Thompson prior to the 2008 Iowa Caucus. In 2012 he decided not to endorse. This is one of the bigger endorsements that a candidate can pick up in the state of Iowa. The FAMiLY Leader CEO and President Bob Vander Plaats is the other. Iowa Governor Terry Branstad has said that he will not endorse.\n\nWhile I don\u2019t believe in a \u201ckingmaker\u201d type of endorsements, they do help drive a campaign narrative and bring media attention to a campaign which is extremely helpful.", "article_metadata": {"shareaholic": {"site_name": "Caffeinated Thoughts", "language": "en-US", "url": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/2015/11/steve-king-is-making-an-iowa-caucus-announcement/", "article_author_name": "Shane Vander Hart", "image": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/steve-king-cerro-gordo.jpg", "site_id": "965f58835b5900850067f65116487024", "article_published_time": "2015-11-15T23:01:39+00:00", "shareable_page": "true", "article_modified_time": "2016-05-26T05:30:14+00:00", "keywords": "bob vander plaats, iowa caucus, steve king, ted cruz, terry branstad, election central", "wp_version": "7.7.1.0"}, "description": "Congressman Steve King (R-IA) will be making a major Iowa Caucus announcement on Monday morning which is most likely an endorsement of Ted Cruz.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Caffeinated Thoughts", "description": "Congressman Steve King (R-IA) will be making a major Iowa Caucus announcement on Monday morning which is most likely an endorsement of Ted Cruz.", "title": "Steve King Is Making an Iowa Caucus Announcement | Caffeinated Thoughts", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/steve-king-cerro-gordo.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-11-15T21:15:28-05:00", "url": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/2015/11/steve-king-is-making-an-iowa-caucus-announcement/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Congressman Steve King (R-IA) will be making a major Iowa Caucus announcement on Monday morning which is most likely an endorsement of Ted Cruz.", "creator": "@shanevanderhart", "image": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/steve-king-cerro-gordo.jpg", "title": "Steve King Is Making an Iowa Caucus Announcement | Caffeinated Thoughts", "site": "@CaffThoughts", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 259594777484510}, "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/CaffThoughts", "published_time": "2015-11-15T17:01:39-05:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/shanevanderhart", "section": "Election Central", "modified_time": "2015-11-15T21:15:28-05:00", "tag": "Terry Branstad"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Congressman Steve King (R-IA) notified the media this afternoon that he will be making a major Iowa Caucus announcement on Monday morning.\nI think the safe bet is a King endorsement of Ted Cruz however.\nKing endorsed the late Senator Fred Thompson prior to the 2008 Iowa Caucus.\nI also wouldn\u2019t be surprised by an endorsement of Donald Trump since he and King are aligned on immigration which is one of King\u2019s top issues.\nIf he decided not to endorse he wouldn\u2019t schedule a press conference to say that."}
