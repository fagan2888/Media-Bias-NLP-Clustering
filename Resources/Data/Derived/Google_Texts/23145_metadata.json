Butch Otter has built a long political career on disdain for the federal government, stirring talk of freedom and encouraging Idahoans to be the \u201carchitects of our own destiny.\u201d\n\nSo the 72-year-old, a millionaire rancher who ran for Congress a decade and a half ago on a pledge to tell the feds to \u201cbutt out\u201d of the state, seems a bit puzzled about his GOP primary challenge by a state Senate leader who maintains Otter is not conservative enough.\n\n\u201cDid I ever believe in my life somebody would run at me from the right? No, I didn\u2019t,\u201d Otter said, as he paused from campaigning for a third term as governor, walking door to door in a Meridian neighborhood.\n\nHis challenger, Senate Majority Caucus Chairman Russ Fulcher, heads a slate of Republican candidates taking on Idaho\u2019s top GOP officeholders in the primary. The challengers say the incumbents are not true enough to the Idaho Republican Party\u2019s platform, not sufficiently averse to the Affordable Care Act, and wrong not to dump Common Core standards for schoolkids or try to take title to federal public lands in the state.\n\nFulcher, who represents Meridian, calls the Affordable Care Act \u201cthe greatest expansion of government in our lifetimes,\u201d and faults Otter for pushing for a state-based health insurance exchange. He also says that with a \u201cbroke\u201d federal government, Idaho has the best shot it\u2019s ever had at getting title to the more than 60 percent of the state that now consists of federal public lands, much of it grazing or forest land.\n\n\u201cWe have an opportunity to take an asset that is a declining asset and make it productive for everybody,\u201d Fulcher said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very compelling legal case.\u201d\n\nOtter disagrees, as does Idaho Attorney General Lawrence Wasden. So do an array of experts who\u2019ve addressed a joint legislative committee examining the transfer of federal lands to the state and who have raised both legal and financial concerns.\n\n\u201cYou have a responsibility when you\u2019re governing to follow the rule of law,\u201d Otter said. \u201cI don\u2019t like going only 75 mph on the freeway, but that\u2019s the law.\u201d\n\nHe added, however, \u201cI understand their resistance to an excessive, intrusive federal government.\u201d\n\nOtter maintains that Idaho\u2019s state exchange prevented federal overreach into the state, because the feds would have run an exchange for Idaho if it hadn\u2019t started its own. \u201cThe people that voted for the health exchange voted to keep Obamacare out of Idaho,\u201d Otter said. \u201cI think every Republican that voted for the state exchange would vote tomorrow to get rid of Obamacare. But every state has an insurance exchange today.\u201d\n\nThe GOP primary race between Otter and Fulcher has attracted intense interest for many reasons, including the novelty of a high-ranking GOP state official taking on the party\u2019s top officeholder. But it\u2019s also highlighted the split in the state Republican Party, which has been dominated in recent years by party purists who pushed successfully to close their primary election to anyone other than registered Republicans and to fill the state party platform with positions like opposition to Otter\u2019s new exchange; calling for a return to the gold standard; and backing repeal of the 17th Amendment so that state legislatures, rather than voters, would elect U.S. senators.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re splintered \u2013 we\u2019re fractured,\u201d Fulcher said. But he said, \u201cThere\u2019s not one position that I know of where I don\u2019t line up with the Republican Party platform and the Republican Party central committee. The Affordable Care Act is an example, Common Core is an example, closed primary is an example. The attorney general and the governor were on the other side of that, so who\u2019s the fringe? \u2026 They\u2019re the ones that have stepped out of bounds.\u201d\n\nIdaho\u2019s primary elections traditionally get low voter turnout, and that\u2019s worsened since the closed primary was implemented two years ago. In 2012, fewer than a quarter of registered voters cast ballots. That reality has made the governor\u2019s race potentially more competitive, despite Otter\u2019s much greater name recognition and financial edge.\n\nOtter says voters are being \u201cproselytized\u201d with tantalizing claims that fly in the face of reality and the law. \u201cI think we ought to stand for something in this party, and I think we do \u2013 not just when it\u2019s convenient,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s convenient now to be against Common Core. It\u2019s convenient now to be against the insurance exchange.\u201d\n\nFulcher says he knows it could be difficult to reverse health care reform, replace Common Core standards and, particularly, to take over federal lands.\n\n\u201cJust like with any goal, if you don\u2019t put the goal out there and if you don\u2019t put a strategy in place to go get it, you know the answer\u2019s going to be no,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how long it\u2019ll take, but I think we\u2019ve got a shot.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "BOISE \u2013 Idaho Gov.
