"I had to lay in bed for a year because I couldn't move my leg. I had to quit my job. I had four kids. It was bad." Otto feels that since the implementation of the ACA he is much better off, but he still has opposition to the law. "I don't think it's right that people are forced to get it."

Robert Otto used to go to the emergency room for care when he was uninsured — if he sought care at all.

"A lot of times, when I got sick, I suffered," said Otto, 38, a psychology student at Big Sandy Community & Technical College in Floyd County, Ky.

But that changed last February when Otto signed up for Medicaid through the Affordable Care Act. Now, he said, he goes to the doctor whenever it's necessary. That's meant finally getting regular care for his bad back, which at one point kept him couch-bound much of the time.

"Obamacare has helped him and many people in Floyd County," said his fiance and fellow student, Wendy Boyd.

Still, both Otto and Boyd share a sentiment common in these hills — that the ACA shouldn't fine people for not having insurance, as it does. While insurance is valuable to most people, Boyd said, not everyone believes they have to have it, and "I don't think you should be penalized for something you don't need."
