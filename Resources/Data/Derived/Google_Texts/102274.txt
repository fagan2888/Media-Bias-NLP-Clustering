The Kansas Legislature is considering a bill that would require cities and counties to obtain a warrant to inspect rental properties.

The House Commerce, Labor and Economic Development Committee conducted a hearing on the bill Wednesday.

The Lawrence Journal-World reports that the bill would prohibit cities and counties from adopting local laws that allow periodic inspection of rental housing without a search warrant, and it would declare any existing rental licensing ordinances that don't meet the bill's standards null and void.

The bill would also allow tenants to retain the right to request an inspection as long as they are not subject to an eviction order.

The committee took no action on the bill Wednesday.
