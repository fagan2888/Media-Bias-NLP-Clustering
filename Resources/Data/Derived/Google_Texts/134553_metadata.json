Four years later\u2014and a lot of political fighting\u2014the same is still true.\n\n\u201cReminds me of when my kids were little and they used to throw a tantrum when they didn\u2019t get their way. The difference is that my kids eventually realized that we\u2019d settled the matter and it was time to move on,\u201d said Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Shultz.\n\nRepublicans haven\u2019t moved on and both parties have squared-off over and over again.\n\n\u201cThis is a disaster all the way around,\u201d said Marco Rubio. \u201cI don\u2019t know of anyone that wants to shutdown the government, the only thing we want to shutdown is Obama Care.\u201d\n\nProfessor Charles Zelden from Nova Southeastern University says that this is nothing new\u2014it\u2019s happened in the past with Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.\n\n\u201cThe Republicans don\u2019t like this because they\u2019re afraid it\u2019s going to work, it will give political advantage to the Democrats,\u201d said Zelden.\n\n\u201cEach time there is an expansion, starting with Social Security in the late 1930s. There are people who claim it\u2019s horrible it\u2019s un-American it will destroy liberty, it will destroy freedom, it\u2019s socialism, it is going to take us to a horrible place. And then people begin to see the effects of it and say \u2018hey this is good for me\u2019 and all of a sudden now it becomes popular at which point all those people who were attacking it sort of quietly stop attacking it,\u201d said Zelden.\n\nThe political division is not just in Congress, Republicans in the Florida Legislature refused to acknowledge the ACA and passed on 51 billion in federal money to cover about a million low-income Florida residents.\n\nDemocrats in protest brought the last days of the session to a halt using stall tactics leading to further hostility between the two parties.\n\nWhen Governor Rick Scott was asked if he planned to stand in the way or embrace the ACA and move further, he responded, \u201cWell look it\u2019s the law of the land, so while it\u2019s the law of the land, I\u2019m going to continue to do my job.\u201d\n\nGovernor Rick Scott has held the line with the Republican party recently trying to block navigators, people trained to help you sign up for health insurance. He claimed it had to do with privacy concerns.\n\n\u201cEven Obama administration is acknowledging there\u2019s an issue so that\u2019s my concern. Everything else you have to call the Department of Health.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s likely the politics of healthcare will have lasting effects. If the Affordable Care Act Works works or fails it could certainly affect upcoming elections.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Christmas Eve 2009 was they day when the U.S. Senate passed the Affordable Care Act along party lines; Democrats for it and Republicans against it.
