So Congress basically said to the states, OK, you help us set this stuff up and we'll pay for it,\" Napolitano said.\"If the states refused to help the federal government set it up, the federal government simply does not, believe it or not, have the resources to set it up,\" he said.\"So that will seriously impair the ability of Obamacare to become the opiate of the masses that the president hopes that it will become if enough states say no. South Carolina will strike a blow for state sovereignty and if enough states follow suit, it will seriously impair the ability of the statute to be as effective as the president wants it to be,\" the jurist said.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "carolina,outlaw,obamacare,test", "pubdate": "2013-12-12T18:33:31", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "South Carolina's plan to pass a bill outlawing the Affordable Care Act in the Palmetto State will be a test case for the rest of the country, former New Jersey Superior Court Judge Andrew Napolitano says.", "title": "Andrew Napolitano: SC Plan to Ban Obamacare Will Be 'Test Case'", "url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Newsmax-Tv/carolina-outlaw-obamacare-test/2013/12/12/id/541580/", "type": "article", "image": "http://www.newsmax.com/App_Themes/Newsmax/images/facebook/newsmaxFBLogo.gif", "page_id": 85452072376}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Newsmax-Tv/carolina-outlaw-obamacare-test/2013/12/12/id/541580/", "title": "Andrew Napolitano: SC Plan to Ban Obamacare Will Be 'Test Case'", "description": "South Carolina's plan to pass a bill outlawing the Affordable Care Act in the Palmetto State will be a test case for the rest of the country, former New Jersey Superior Court Judge Andrew Napolitano says.", "site": "Newsmax"}, "fb": {"admins": 100002083767056, "app_id": 323020797885219}, "msvalidate.01": "FAF1322EC761685A5DD9344A1C19E82A", "epoch": 1386873211, "google-site-verification": "Jt2HUKgzJJw9VwIQJv31ETytuvNNm5ypTWN6j0nYvHM", "keywords": "carolina,outlaw,obamacare,test", "article": {"section": "Newsmax-Tv", "published_time": "2013-12-12T18:33:31"}, "original-source": "http://www.newsmax.com/Newsmax-Tv/carolina-outlaw-obamacare-test/2013/12/12/id/541580/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "description": "South Carolina's plan to pass a bill outlawing the Affordable Care Act in the Palmetto State will be a test case for the rest of the country, former New Jersey Superior Court Judge Andrew Napolitano says."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcff20\"", "article_summary": "\"South Carolina will present a test case: Will the feds come into South Carolina and set up their own exchange at their own expense?\"\n\"They could probably afford to do it in South Carolina, but if other states, like \u2026 New Jersey, were to do that, if [Gov.]\nSouth Carolina's plan to pass a bill outlawing the Affordable Care Act in the Palmetto State will be a test case for the rest of the country, former New Jersey Superior Court Judge Andrew Napolitano says.\nSo Congress basically said to the states, OK, you help us set this stuff up and we'll pay for it,\" Napolitano said.\n\"The Supreme Court said \u2026 if you want exchanges in the states, you, Congress, have to pay for them."}
