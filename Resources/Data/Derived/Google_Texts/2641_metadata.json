A new wrinkle in a high-profile, 22-year-old tax case gives fodder to those who make such claims.\n\nIn 1970, a young Southern California electrical engineer and inventor named Gilbert Hyatt filed a patent application for an innovative microprocessor chip. That was a year before Intel patented its chip, which led to the personal-computer revolution.\n\nTwenty years later, after a complex legal battle over the origins of that technology, the U.S. patent office awarded Hyatt the patent for a microprocessor \u2014 a shocking and still controversial decision (that was later partially overturned) that would provide Hyatt with a multimillion-dollar windfall. He moved to Las Vegas, where he said he was a full-time resident before he received the earnings.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s Franchise Tax Board (FTB) saw a newspaper article congratulating Hyatt for his patent and decided to seek $7.4 million in back taxes, claiming that he was still a resident of California when the money came in. That sounds like a simple enough dispute that could quickly be resolved, but what followed has been an ordeal that has consumed a good bit of Hyatt\u2019s adult life.\n\nOn Friday, Hyatt, now 76, filed a federal lawsuit accusing the state of violating his constitutional rights in pursuit of a sum that now tops $55 million as interest and penalties have accrued. He\u2019s asking for an injunction forbidding the state from pursing its claim any further. After all these years and legal expenses, he just wants California to leave him alone already.\n\nThe tax authorities have been pursing him through its administrative process. Tired of the endless investigations, Hyatt filed suit in Nevada court in 1998. California officials said they weren\u2019t subject to an out-of-state tort lawsuit. California lost that argument in the Nevada Supreme Court and the U.S. Supreme Court and the high court decision sent the case back to a Nevada district court, which awarded Hyatt nearly $400 million in damages after finding that the California authorities abused their power and invaded his privacy. That case is on appeal.\n\nHyatt believes that California officials are purposefully delaying. \u201cSpecifically, because of the 20 year delay Hyatt can no longer obtain a fair and full adjudication of whether he owes state taxes to California,\u201d according to his lawsuit. \u201cDuring this time, material witnesses have passed away, memories of witnesses have faded, and documents relevant and important to Hyatt are no longer available.\u201d The board keeps assessing penalties, so he says it has every reason to keep delaying. He suspects the tax board is waiting for him to die so that it can go after his estate.\n\nUnder California law, the Franchise Tax Board has the \u201cpresumption of correctness,\u201d meaning that the onus always is on Hyatt to disprove what the tax officials say. And, he argues, they keep changing their stories and their allegations, thus resulting in more years of legal expenses and disputes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ruined my life. They keep coming up with these intensive positions, many hundreds of pages of allegations and such that we have to try and disprove decades later and it\u2019s just very consuming,\u201d Hyatt told me in an interview last week. \u201cThe FTB is out to get taxpayers\u2019 money and it will go to extreme ends to get money whether it is entitled to it or not....\u201d\n\nThe state controller\u2019s office has yet to review the newly filed lawsuit. But former Board of Equalization member Bill Leonard, a former Republican Assemblyman, believes the state government is abusing rules designed to give taxpayers every opportunity to appeal a judgment to drag out a case against a taxpayer. The Legislature could fix the problem with a law granting a right to speedy trial on tax matters, he added.\n\nIt\u2019s hard not to conclude that California\u2019s tax agency is out of line as it continues to run up administrative and legal fees \u2014 not to mention risking potential multimillion-dollar liabilities \u2014 to pursue a decades-old dispute over where a taxpayer lived for six months. There\u2019s a troubling lesson here for wannabe entrepreneurs, who might want to think carefully about their residency before they hit the big time.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "The state has been harassing him for decades", "title": "California Demands $55 Million from Microprocessor Inventor", "url": "http://reason.com/archives/2014/04/11/this-is-how-california-harasses-entrepre", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/13970525426486.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@reason", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/13970525426486.jpg", "description": "SACRAMENTO\u2014Business owners who have fled California often say\ntheir decision to leave wasn\u2019t just about tax rates, but about the\npunitive attitudes sometimes found among tax and regulatory\nauthorities here.
