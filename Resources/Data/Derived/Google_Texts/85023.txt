Malcolm X | MGN

Activists, actors, and politicians are remembering civil rights leader Malcolm X with a ceremony at the New York site in Harlem where he was killed 50 years ago.

About 300 people are expected to hear remarks from one of Malcolm X's daughters, Ilyasah Shabazz, as well as U.S. Rep. Charles Rangel and other officials.

The ceremony Saturday is being held at the Malcolm X & Dr. Betty Shabazz Memorial and Educational Center, previously known as the Audubon Ballroom. Malcolm X was shot to death there Feb. 21, 1965, as he was preparing to address his followers. By then, the Muslim leader had moderated his militant message of black separatism but remained a passionate advocate of self-respect and self-reliance.

Veteran social and political activist Ron Daniels will give the keynote address.
