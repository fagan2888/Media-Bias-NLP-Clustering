State Medicaid and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) are required to cover children\u2019s dental services (and children\u2019s access to care has been improving over the last ten years), but coverage for adults is optional. As noted in a recent Health Affairs GrantWatch Blog post, only about 15 states offer extensive coverage for adult dental services in Medicaid.\n\nMedicare does not cover most dental services. And most private dental coverage is offered through stand-alone dental products that are separate from medical plans. Overall, this has resulted in more than 2.5 times as many Americans going without dental coverage as medical coverage.\n\nInadequate access to dental care is costly. Many low-income individuals turn to the emergency department as their primary and only source of care for oral health needs. The American Dental Association estimates that emergency room visits for avoidable oral health-related visits cost the U.S. health care system as much as two billion dollars per year. A recent Narrative Matters feature in Health Affairs (\u201cNavigating Veronika\u201d) highlighted the steep barriers that low-income individuals can face in navigating the dental safety net and finding a provider who will treat them, even when Medicaid covers the costs of care.\n\nThe ACA and Pediatric Dental Benefits\n\nThe Affordable Care Act (ACA) introduced some big changes to the dental insurance landscape. Pediatric dental benefits (but not adult benefits) were included in the set of ten essential health benefits (EHB) that plans offered on state and federal marketplaces must include. However, subsequent federal guidance treats pediatric dental benefits differently from the other EHB categories, creating unique challenges in implementing a guaranteed pediatric dental benefit.\n\nThe ACA allows dental benefits to be \u201cembedded\u201d in medical Qualified Health Plans (QHPs), or offered as stand-alone products. (You may remember last fall\u2019s kerfuffle over double-counting of individuals who enrolled in both medical and dental coverage.) This differing treatment affects benefit design, availability of financial subsidies, consumer shopping experience, and the uptake of dental coverage for both children and adults. Most importantly, the cost of a pediatric stand-alone dental plan is not included in the calculation of a family\u2019s federal tax credits, and there is no federal requirement that individuals purchase a stand-alone dental plan. So, if an enrollee opts to purchase stand-alone dental coverage, he or she is responsible for the full premium, which averaged $27 or more per month in 2015.\n\nEven without subsidies, about one million individuals purchased stand-alone dental coverage on the federally-facilitated marketplace in 2014, and uptake appears to be strongest among young adults. This highlights the potentially strong role for health insurance marketplaces to close the dental coverage gap.\n\nState-based Exchanges\n\nOver the past two years, we at the National Academy for State Health Policy (NASHP) have been actively tracking implementation of dental benefits in marketplaces. We have worked with state marketplace leaders, and dental and health policy experts to explore the challenges and potential policy solutions in a comprehensive report and chart of key state decisions.\n\nFor the 2015 plan year, some states have rethought and tweaked their pediatric dental offerings. We recently checked in with policy experts at three state-based marketplaces\u2014California, Connecticut, and Washington\u2014to look back at decisions the states made on dental benefits in the individual market for the 2014 plan year and to look ahead to changes for 2015 and beyond. Here\u2019s a little of what we learned:\n\nCalifornia. Covered California offered pediatric dental benefits through stand-alone dental products only in 2014, and did not require that families purchase dental coverage. Data from the first open enrollment showed that just 36 percent of children enrolled in a QHP on the marketplace also enrolled in a stand-alone dental policy. With this low take-up in mind, for 2015, California asked issuers to submit QHPs that embedded pediatric dental benefits. All the plans participating on the California marketplace did so. The state is also working to offer adult dental products for the 2016 plan year.\n\nWashington. In year one, Washington Healthplanfinder offered pediatric dental benefits only through stand-alone dental plans because a state law, HB 2319, required that dental benefits offered in the marketplace be \u201coffered and priced separately.\u201d Unlike California, Washington also put in place a mandatory purchase requirement \u2014 meaning that families with children age 18 and younger purchasing a medical plan through the marketplace were required to purchase a stand-alone dental plan, unless the child qualified for CHIP. Looking ahead, Washington expects to retain the current benefit design structure for children in future years. However, the marketplace is considering adding adult dental coverage in 2016.\n\nConnecticut. In 2014, all medical plans offered on Access Health CT included embedded pediatric dental benefits. By embedding these benefits, the marketplace was able to ensure that all enrolled children would receive dental coverage, and that the cost of pediatric dental benefits would be included in the calculation of tax subsidies. In 2014, Connecticut also offered stand-alone dental plans for both adults and children on an external website that was linked to Access Health CT. For 2015, the marketplace kept its approach of requiring embedded pediatric dental benefits for standard benefit plans, but also enhanced the Access Health CT website to offer stand-alone dental plans for adults.\n\nThese three states exemplify the ways that health insurance marketplaces and health plan issuers are continuing to refine their approaches to encourage enrollment for children, and make products available for adults. An important issue to watch relates to CHIP \u2014 state CHIP programs are required to cover children\u2019s dental services, but if CHIP funding expires, children in the program will transition to the marketplaces, where dental coverage is much less certain.\n\nIf you want to learn more about oral health and the ACA, the American Dental Association\u2019s Health Policy Institute and the Children\u2019s Dental Health Project have useful resources, and NASHP will be updating our report on oral health and the ACA in the coming months.\n\nAuthor\u2019s note: Portions of this blog appeared previously on State Refor(u)m.
