Maybe I'm only talking about myself. The jazz scene I loved so much in my early twenties begins to recede unless I make an affirmative effort to go charging toward it. So at this time of year, every year, we consult with jazz savants and musicians and ask them about the best music they heard all year.\n\nToday we're varying our format a little, having two jazz mavens in studio and asking three of our favorite musicians, Jane Ira Bloom, Joel Frahm and Noah Baerman call in, each of them talking about just one track of a 2013 recording.\n\nIn the midst of all the getting ready, I gradually realized that Jane Ira's brand new release, sixteen Sunsets, may wind up being my own favorite this year.\n\nWhat's your favorite jazz of 2013?
