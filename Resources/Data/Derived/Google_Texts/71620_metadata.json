(AP) - Officials with Houston-based Clean Line Energy Partners say construction could begin in 2017 on a planned 700-mile transmission line to carry wind-generated electricity across Oklahoma and Arkansas into Tennessee.\n\nThe planned Plains & Eastern Clean Line would carry the wind power from as-yet undeveloped wind farms in the Oklahoma Panhandle to Memphis, Tennessee, where it would connect to the Tennessee Valley Authority.\n\nMario Hurtado, Clean Line vice president for development, told The Journal Record that he expects the project, announced in 2010, to be operating by 2020.\n\n\u201cIt takes a lot of time to put together an infrastructure project like this,\u201d Hurtado said.\n\nHowever, opposition has surfaced in Arkansas, where the state\u2019s six-member congressional delegation has objected to the federal government possibly using eminent domain to take land for the project. The federal lawmakers say eminent domain should be decided at the state and local level.\n\n\u201cWe continue to have serious concerns that this project erodes the rights of local communities and the state of Arkansas to have a seat at the table in the decision-making process,\u201d according to a statement from Sens. John Boozman and Tom Cotton and Reps. Steve Womack, French Hill, Rick Crawford and Bruce Westerman following a Dec. 10 meeting with U.S. Department of Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz.\n\nAll of the six lawmakers are Republicans.\n\nClean Line officials say about $7 billion will be invested in the project, boosting economies in both Oklahoma and Arkansas.\n\n\u201cSeveral hundred permanent, quality wind tech and support jobs will be created to operate and maintain the line and wind farms,\u201d said Vicki Ayres-Portman, Clean Line outreach manager based in Guymon.\n\n\u201cMillions of dollars annually will go to counties, schools and landowners,\u201d Ayres-Portman said. \u201cIt is a great way for our farmers and ranchers to diversify their income as well.\u201d\n\nIn November, researchers from the center for Business and Economic Research at the University of Arkansas published a study that estimated the construction of operation of the transmission project will add more than $660 million to the economy in Arkansas.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Officials with Houston-based Clean Line Energy Partners say construction could begin in 2017 on a planned 700-mile transmission line to carry wind-generated electricity across Oklahoma and Arkansas into Tennessee.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/dec/19/construction-could-start-in-2017-on-wind-transmiss/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "Officials with Houston-based Clean Line Energy Partners say construction could begin in 2017 on a planned 700-mile transmission line to carry wind-generated electricity across Oklahoma and Arkansas into Tennessee.", "title": "Construction could start in 2017 on wind transmission line"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "description": "Officials with Houston-based Clean Line Energy Partners say construction could begin in 2017 on a planned 700-mile transmission line to carry wind-generated electricity across Oklahoma and Arkansas in", "card": "summary", "title": "Construction could start in 2017 on wind transmission line"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "GUYMON, Okla.
