Evansville-based Crosspointe Insurance Advisors is bulking up its staff in preparation for the upcoming health insurance open enrollment season.

The company, co-founded by Drew Shockley and Josh Mushlock in 2008, focuses on health insurance for individuals, families, businesses and retirees. It is based in Evansville but also has an office in St. Louis.

Shockley said the company, which had 22 employees as of two weeks ago, plans to add 60 positions between now and October. More than 50 of those jobs will be Evansville-based.

One of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act is that individuals are now required to have health insurance. If not covered by an employer, individuals can buy insurance through what's called the Health Care Marketplace.

Under the law, people who meet income guidelines can receive subsidies that reduce premium costs and/or out-of-pocket expenses. Those who go without insurance face penalties when they file federal income taxes.

"The Affordable Care Act laws created a lot of confusion and a lot of complexity for everyone," Shockley said.

That confusion means people have a greater need for guidance when choosing a plan, Shockley said. At the same time, the complexities of the new law have caused some insurance agencies to exit the individual health insurance market.

Last year, Shockley said, "we were setting appointments two and three weeks out because we just didn't have enough people."

Open enrollment for the Health Care Marketplace runs Nov. 1 through Jan. 31, 2016. Open enrollment for Medicare runs Oct. 15 through Dec. 7.
