That gives congressional Republicans an added boost in their drive to approve the $8 billion project to transport crude oil from Alberta, Canada, south to the Gulf Coast.\n\nSome 57 percent of the 1,011 Americans surveyed Dec. 18-21 support the pipeline project, while only 28 percent are against it and 15 percent said they aren\u2019t sure. No big surprise here, because previous polls have shown that as many as two-thirds of the public favor the project as a way of bolstering the economy, creating new construction jobs and enhancing the country\u2019s energy self-sufficiency.\n\nRelated: Cities Face Costly Projects to Cope with Climate Change\n\nThe CNN poll also offers some eye-opening insights into Americans\u2019 views of the threat of global warming. A majority of those polled \u2013 or 57 percent \u2013 said that global warming will not pose a serious threat to their way of life, while only 43 percent said they expect global warming will affect them and their families.\n\nWHY THIS MATTERS\n\n\n\nThe new Republican Congress and President Obama have listed their priorities for the coming year \u2013 including tax reform, trade and infrastructure -- but with no mention of addressing global warming. Many mainstream scientists have warned repeatedly that, if left unchecked, the rise in greenhouse gas emissions will be catastrophic and highly costly in the coming decades. But with so many Americans either unaware or disbelieving of the threat of climate change, it\u2019s no surprise that conservative lawmakers continue to put industrial growth ahead of environmental protection.\n\nMeanwhile \u2013 despite ample scientific evidence that carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants and other industrial facilities contribute directly to climate change \u2013 only 50 percent of Americans believe global warming is caused by man-made emissions. Twenty-three percent insist that global warming is caused by natural changes while 26 percent said that man\u2019s contribution to the mounting climate change problems isn\u2019t proven fact.\n\nIn other words, a huge number of Americans essentially buy into newly ensconced Republican Senate Environment and Natural Resources Committee Chair James Inhofe\u2019s view that scientists\u2019 alarm over global warming is largely a hoax that is threatening much-needed industrial expansion. Inhofe has compared the Environmental Protection Agency to the Gestapo, according to the Huffington Post. He thinks the United Nations invented the idea of climate change to \u201cshut down the machine called America.\u201d\n\nThis may all help explain why the Obama administration and environmentalists have faced an uphill climb over the past six years in trying to generate political support for ways to reduce the production of greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming.\n\nSubstantial scientific research by the UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and others over the years have documented the connections between man-made carbon emissions and global warming and have warned of dire consequences \u2013 from drought and fierce storms to melting of polar ice caps to rising sea levels that threaten coastal areas.\n\nRelated: Obama Fights Global Warming, One Hot Spot at a Time\n\nLast Wednesday, a study by Harvard and Rutgers university scientists published in the journal Nature confirmed numerous previous estimates that the rate of sea-level rise jumped 5 inches over the course of the 20th century.\n\nA United Nations subcommittee led by Peter U. Clark, a geologist at Oregon State University, and John A. Church, a scientist with Australia\u2019s national scientific organization said last year the sea could rise as much as three feet by the end of this century if nothing was done to prevent the continued high levels of greenhouse gases, The New York Times reported yesterday.\n\nLast September, White House budget director Shaun Donovan declared in a speech that unabated global warming will have huge budget and economic consequences for the U.S., potentially draining state and federal coffers of hundreds of billions of dollars in the coming years. Donovan\u2019s speech, in advance of President Obama\u2019s participation at the United Nations Climate Summit, offered a sobering fiscal scenario for the country as rising temperatures fostered worse hurricanes, storms, wildfires and flooding.\n\nSome scientists and conservative lawmakers like Inhofe have challenged the research and argue that warnings of the risks from climate change are overblown. In his speech to the liberal Center for American Progress, Donovan said, \u201cFrom where I sit, climate action is a must do, climate inaction is a can\u2019t do, and climate denial scores \u2013 and I don\u2019t mean scoring points on the board. I mean that it scores in the budget \u2013 climate denial will cost us billions of dollars.\u201d\n\nRelated: Global Warming Skeptics Give Obama the Cold Shoulder\n\nA Department of State analysis of the Keystone Pipeline proposal found that it would increase greenhouse gas emissions. That\u2019s because oil from Alberta\u2019s tar sands is one of the most polluting kinds of oil and considerable energy must be expended to extract the oil from the tar sands, according to Scientific American. The State Department also noted that just running the pipeline for a year once built would generate the same greenhouse gas pollution as roughly 300,000 cars over the same period of time. Moreover, the oil carried by the pipeline could add as much as 27 million metric tons of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere each year, most of that from its ultimate use as fuel.\n\nHowever, regardless of whether the pipeline is ever built, TransCanada will continue to mine and melt tar sands in Canada \u2013 adding to the world\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. The company already is shipping the oil by rail or truck, and would continue to do so Obama ultimately blocks the pipeline project.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A new", "title": "Keystone Pipeline and the \u2018Myth\u2019 of Global Warming", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/01/15/Keystone-Pipeline-and-Myth-Global-Warming", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-keystone-senate_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/01/15/Keystone-Pipeline-and-Myth-Global-Warming", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-keystone-senate_2.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "A new", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbecb\"", "article_summary": "A majority of those polled \u2013 or 57 percent \u2013 said that global warming will not pose a serious threat to their way of life, while only 43 percent said they expect global warming will affect them and their families.\nTwenty-three percent insist that global warming is caused by natural changes while 26 percent said that man\u2019s contribution to the mounting climate change problems isn\u2019t proven fact.\nRelated: Cities Face Costly Projects to Cope with Climate ChangeThe CNN poll also offers some eye-opening insights into Americans\u2019 views of the threat of global warming.\nSome scientists and conservative lawmakers like Inhofe have challenged the research and argue that warnings of the risks from climate change are overblown.\nWHY THIS MATTERSThe new Republican Congress and President Obama have listed their priorities for the coming year \u2013 including tax reform, trade and infrastructure -- but with no mention of addressing global warming."}
