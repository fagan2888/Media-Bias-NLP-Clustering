As chief compliance officer, Hacker will manage and oversee the company's ethics and compliance program.\n\nThe announcement comes a day after Tenet dropped out of the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index due to its its falling stock price and investor unease over a rocky past few months.\n\nAs of Thursday, Tenet's market capitalization was down 50 percent from July 2015, landing at about $2.8 billion. The company lost $140 million last year, reports say, due in part to a False Claims Act settlement.\n\n[Also: Tenet Healthcare will pay $238 million to settle maternity referral kickback allegations]\n\nHacker will report directly to the Quality, Compliance and Ethics Committee of Tenet's board of directors.\n\nTrevor Fetter, chairman and chief executive officer of Tenet, said in a statement that Hacker's hiring reflects the organization's desire to \"operate from a strong foundation of values supported by an effective compliance program.\"\n\n\"Integrity is an essential part of Tenet's culture,\" said Hacker in a statement.\n\nHe replaces Vanessa Benavides, who left Tenet to assume the leadership of compliance and privacy operations at Kaiser Permanente. Previously, Hacker spent more than a decade at Pfizer, where he served in various roles within its legal and compliance teams.\n\nTwitter: @JELagasse", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/tenet-names-pfizer-exec-chief-compliance-office-healthcare-company-falls-sp-500", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/Tenet-Healthcare-HQ-google-feature_2_0.gif", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Tenet Healthcare announced Thursday that Howard Hacker has been named senior vice president and chief compliance officer, a role that will begin on May 2.
