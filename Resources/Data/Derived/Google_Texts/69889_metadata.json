Three are asking to decrease rates, and two replaced all existing 2015 plans.\n\nBlue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan and its HMO Blue Care Network of Michigan are the largest providers on the exchange, affecting 310,000 individuals. Together, they plan a rate increase of about 10 percent. The companies also asked for increases in 2015.\n\nBCBSM Director of Individual Business Rick Notter said that \"most of the increase is the result of medical trend or increased medical cost.\"\n\nHe said about 7 percent of the increase was driven by that cost.\n\nThe company asking for the biggest increase in rates is UnitedHealthcare Community Plan Inc. at 14.7 percent. The company with the biggest decrease is Meridian Health Plan of Michigan Inc. at -12.6 percent.\n\nDIFS noted that the proposed rate changes don't reflect a comparison between providers, since each has a different starting point. In addition, individuals who receive tax credits through the exchange will experience different rate changes because of the tax credit calculation. The actual changes consumers experience could vary, because rates vary based on plan, geographic area and tobacco use.\n\nThe department is accepting public comment on the proposed rate increases through June 30. Those wishing to comment should submit an email to HealthRateComments@michigan.gov. DIFS will review the proposed changes. The rate changes, if approved, would go into effect Jan. 1, 2016.\n\nEmily Lawler is a Capitol/Business reporter for MLive.
