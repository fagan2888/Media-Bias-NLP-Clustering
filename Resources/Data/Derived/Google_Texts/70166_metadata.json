This week, as we\u2019ve come under intense criticism for doing so, we\u2019ve reviewed our profile and have concluded that it did not meet our standards, so we have taken it down and apologize to Dr. Carson for having posted it.\u201d\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nThough the statement goes on to laud Dr. Carson\u2019s contribution \u201cto medicine, his philanthropic work,\u201d and his \u201cpersonal story,\u201d they still \u201cbelieve his views should be closely examined.\u201d SPLC insists, \u201cDr. Carson has, in fact, made a number of statements that express views that we believe most people would conclude are extreme.\u201d\n\nSPLC lists a number of Carson quotes they charge are extremist, including his comparison of Obamacare to slavery, and that we now \u201clive in a society where people are afraid to say what they believe.\u201d\n\nSPLC is a group that had raised hundreds of millions of dollars\u2014they currently have $300 million under financial management\u2014publishing lists of Nazis, Skin Heads, and KKK groups. In recent years, they have taken on the LGBT cause and have started putting Christian conservatives on their hate lists.\n\nQuite famously, an armed man invaded the offices of the Family Research Council with the intention of murdering as many staffers as he could. He ended up wounding a security guard before he was subdued. He later said he got the idea of shooting up FRC from the SPLC hate list.\n\nMore recently, the North Carolina shooter who gunned down three Muslim students was a Facebook fan of the Southern Poverty Law Center, at least according to his Facebook page.\n\nUp until last year, the FBI used SPLC information in identifying domestic threats. After the FRC shooting, and after a wave of complaints from Christian conservatives, the FBI quietly took SPLC off of its website, though a senior adviser to SPLC told Breitbart News they were still advising the FBI.\n\nThose social conservative groups that have been targeted by SPLC insist that SPLC is a left-wing pressure group out to punish those who disagree with them politically.\n\nEven the left seems to have grown weary of the claims and actions of SPLC. The group has been criticized in Foreign Policy magazine for inflating its hate lists in order to keep donors interested. Similar claims have been made by leftist Alexander Cockburn and also in the pages of Harper\u2019s Magazine.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Southern Poverty Law Center has announced they have removed Dr. Ben Carson from their \u201cextremist\u201d file.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "The Southern Poverty Law Center has announced they have removed Dr. Ben Carson from their \u201cextremist\u201d file.", "title": "SPLC Apologizes, Removes Ben Carson from Extremist List - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/ben-carson-afp.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/02/11/splc-apologizes-removes-ben-carson-from-extremist-list/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Southern Poverty Law Center has announced they have removed Dr. Ben Carson from their \u201cextremist\u201d file.", "creator": "@austinruse", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/ben-carson-afp.jpg", "title": "SPLC Apologizes, Removes Ben Carson from Extremist List - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Ben Carson, extremist, lgbt, Southern Poverty Law Center,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government,ben carson", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Southern Poverty Law Center", "published_time": "2015-02-11T20:33:14-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "In an unsigned statement released on Wednesday, SPLC said, \u201cIn October 2014, we posted an \u2018Extremist File\u2019 of Dr. Ben Carson.\nHe later said he got the idea of shooting up FRC from the SPLC hate list.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe Southern Poverty Law Center has announced they have removed Dr. Ben Carson from their \u201cextremist\u201d file.\nThe group has been criticized in Foreign Policy magazine for inflating its hate lists in order to keep donors interested.\nIn recent years, they have taken on the LGBT cause and have started putting Christian conservatives on their hate lists."}
