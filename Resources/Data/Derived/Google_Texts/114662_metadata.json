However, from domestic surveillance to border security to cyber security, Clinton already has a fairly established record both from her time as secretary of state and her years in the Senate, so some of her positions are reasonably predictable.\n\nRelated: Clinton\u2019s Fuzzy Position on Immigration Worries Activists\n\nNSA SURVEILLANCE\n\nClinton on Thursday tweeted her support for a bill to roll back the National Security Agency\u2019s bulk collection of data. \u201cCongress should move ahead now with the USA Freedom Act\u2014a good step forward in ongoing efforts to protect our security & civil liberties,\u201d she wrote. The White House had endorsed the bill this week.\n\nPrior to her tweet, though, Clinton had been somewhat more hawkish than many in the Democratic Party and, in some areas, more hawkish than at least one of her potential Republican rivals, Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY).\n\nLast year, for example, she generally defended the mass surveillance programs put in place after the 9/11 attacks, and condemned former CIA contractor Edward Snowden, who leaked a massive amount of information about it to the press.\n\n\u201cPeople were desperate to avoid another attack, and I saw enough intelligence as a senator from New York, and then certainly as secretary [of state], that this is a constant\u2014there are people right this minute trying to figure out how to do harm to Americans and to other innocent people,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cSo it was a debate that needs to happen, so that we make sure that we're not infringing on Americans' privacy, which is a valued, cherished personal belief that we have. But we also had to figure out how to get the right amount of security.\u201d\n\nRelated: How the Clinton Scandals Can Bring Down the Democrats\n\nWhile she has appeared to be open to potential reforms of the programs run by the NSA, in the upcoming primaries she is likely to be pushed hard from the left. On Thursday, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, currently her most prominent rival for the Democratic nomination, was unsparing in his criticism of the NSA, which he described as \u201cout of control and operating in an unconstitutional manner.\u201d\n\nBut she may face some pressure from the right as well. On Twitter, the libertarian-leaning Paul wrote, \u201cphone records of law abiding citizens are none of the NSA's business!\"\n\nIMMIGRATION AND BORDER SECURITY\n\nWhen it comes to border security, Clinton will have to walk a delicate line. She\u2019ll want to avoid antagonizing the various pro-immigrant groups whose support she\u2019ll need in the general election while retaining the ability to credibly claim that she has national security top of mind.\n\nIt\u2019s a complicated dance, made harder by the fact that many immigrants rights groups already don\u2019t particularly trust her. This week, Clinton endorsed a policy of providing a path to citizenship for many of the millions of immigrants in the U.S. illegally, but a recording of a 2003 radio interview she gave while serving as a senator from New York that surfaced Thursday shows that she may still have fences to mend.\n\n\u201cI am, you know, adamantly against illegal immigrants,\u201d she says in the interview. Referring to New York towns and neighborhoods, she says, \u201cCome up to Westchester, go to Suffolk and Nassau counties, stand in the street corners in Brooklyn or the Bronx\u2026You\u2019re going to see loads of people waiting to get picked up to go do yard work and construction work and domestic work.\u201d\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s an Economic Agenda for Hillary Clinton\n\nClinton also voted in favor of constructing hundreds of miles of fences along the U.S.-Mexico border and of adding more than 10,000 agents to the Border Patrol in the years after 9/11. Both will shore up her position with national security hawks, while doing little to improve her reputation with pro-immigrant groups.\n\nCYBERSECURITY\n\nPerhaps the stickiest area for Clinton, at least from a political perspective, will be how she deals with the issue of U.S. cybersecurity. Ever since the revelation earlier this year that, as secretary of state, Clinton used a personal email account tied to a server at her home for official business, it\u2019s been a simple thing for political opponents to paint her as the poster child for poor cybersecurity.\n\nThe issue is not minor. This year not only did foreign hackers prove that they can penetrate large corporations, like Sony, they also managed to break into the White House\u2019s non-secure email server and to take over a non-secret State Department email system.\n\nThere may be no winning answer for Clinton here. There isn\u2019t much federal authorities can do to protect private sector Internet security without intruding so far into previously private regions of businesses\u2019 operations that any actions would be broadly condemned by privacy advocates.\n\nThat won\u2019t stop surrogates of Clinton\u2019s opponents from raising the question.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Hillary Clinton, the overwhelming favorite to win the Democratic Party\u2019s nomination for president next year, is going to be asked to go on the record on a lot of domestic security issues.
