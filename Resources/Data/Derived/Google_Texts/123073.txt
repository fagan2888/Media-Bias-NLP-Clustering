Police Chief Chad Caldwell

MONCKS CORNER, SC — Moncks Corner Police Chief Chad Caldwell is planning to resign at the end of the year. He tells News 2 that changes in his benefits mandated by the Obamacare law would force him to give up his current benefit plan. Rather than change his current state plan, Chief Caldwell said he will resign effective December 31st.

Caldwell has been at Moncks Corner for about 15 years. He worked another 11 years at North Charleston’s police department where he served as their police chief. He also worked nearly 20 years as a SLED agent.

Caldwell ran for Berkeley County Sheriff earlier this year. Sheriff Duane Lewis won that GOP primary.

Caldwell said he may end up doing something else in the future, but right now he is planning to take a break.
