TA Associates Invests in Fertility with CCRM

The deal follows the firms Procare Software investment and precedes the planned IPO of TA-backed SkinnyPop

Boston private equity firm TA Associates has invested in CCRM, a network of fertility treatment groups.

CCRM, headquartered in Lone Tree, Colorado, has locations in Colorado, California, Minnesota, Texas and Toronto. The companys clinics provide a range of services, from basic fertility care to in vitro fertilization (IVF). Terms of the deal were not disclosed.

Partnering with TA Associates is critical to our multi-year effort to expand our footprint in North America and around the world, says Jon Pardew, CCRM CEO. The company aims to expand its network of fertility laboratories, as well as use M&A to consolidate the fragmented U.S. IVF market.

Between 5 million and 6 million women of reproductive age attend infertility-related medical appointments each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control  a trend that reflects women choosing to have children at older ages, according to CCRM.

TA has been involved in a handful of deals recently. In July, TA portfolio company Nintex acquired Drawloop Technologies Inc., a document-generation Software. Before that, the firm picked up a majority stake in Procare Software, which provides payments services to childcare management companies. TA also owns SkinnyPop, a snack popcorn brand that is scheduled for an initial public offering on Wednesday, Aug. 5.

There have been a few fertility-related deals recently. In August, Longitude Venture Partners II LP and NovaQuest Pharma Opportunities Fund III LP bought California Cryobank Inc., which provides fertility and cellular therapy, plus frozen donor sperm and other reproductive services.

Goodwin Procter LLP was TAs legal adviser. Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck LLP was CCRMs legal counsel.
