(\u201cOn the other hand \u2026 and on the other hand \u2026 and on the other hand\u2026\u201d) That is why arguments about last week\u2019s report from the Congressional Budget Office have become so frustrating, even when accomplished scholars are the ones doing the arguing. Instead of addressing a subtle and complicated issue with (at least!) two sides, the law\u2019s critics keep turning it into a single-sided moral diatribe about the work ethic and the supposed damage Obamacare is doing to it. A perfect illustration is a recent New York Times Economix column by Casey Mulligan, a University of Chicago economist whose own research has become part of the debate \u2014 and who, in the course of dismissing the Affordable Care Act\u2019s virtues, took a swipe at me, as well.\n\nThe genesis of Mulligan\u2019s article is the surprisingly famous appendix to that CBO report\u2014the part where the agency predicts that the Affordable Care Act will be associated with a reduction in the workforce of the U.S. The bottom line of that report is that the ACA will result in 2 million fewer jobs by 2017. And, as is typical of the generally excellent CBO studies, this report is careful in describing the genesis of this conclusion. The CBO highlights that there are essentially two different sources of the reduced labor supply. The first is voluntary job leaving by those who have been \u201clocked\u201d into their jobs by fear of losing health insurance. Some of these individuals would happily turn down their wage to be retired or caring for children, but were previously unable to do so because they had no other insurance options; now they are able to pursue those preferred approaches. The second is those who are deterred from working by higher marginal tax rates. In particular, since the Affordable Care Act\u2019s financial assistance phases out as income rises, the incentive to work more also declines at higher incomes. In other words, the law\u2019s financial assistance is an implicit tax on earnings\u2014and the tax gets higher as people earn more.\n\nMulligan\u2019s article, and a number of his recent papers, are focused on the effects of these tax rates. He performs detailed computations which show that, for some individuals, that the tax rates can be quite high. In his recent post, Mulligan implies that these high tax rates are the reason for the CBO conclusions on reduced labor market participation. He dismisses the job lock effects as \u201ca completely different issue\u2026and far less prevalent.\u201d He even cites the sentence on page 119-120 which ends with a footnote citing his work as evidence that CBO\u2019s report is focused on high tax rates.\n\nBut Mulligan doesn\u2019t mention that, in the very next paragraph, CBO dismisses his argument. According to the report, his suggested effect doesn\u2019t impact labor supply, but rather health insurance offering (which they model elsewhere). Mulligan claims that CBO was \u201caware of instances of 100% tax rates,\u201d which may be true, but the entire Appendix doesn\u2019t mention this fact even once. It is not surprising that, unlike Mulligan, CBO economists did not harp on examples of 100% tax rates. They are uninterested in calculations that highlight extreme cases. They are more interested in modeling the overall impact on the workforce. Showing that tax rates might be high for a small number of workers is not as important as assessing what happens to aggregate labor supply.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "description": "The economics profession is famous for its balance\u2014as the joke goes, we always need more hands to express all the caveats to our conclusions.
