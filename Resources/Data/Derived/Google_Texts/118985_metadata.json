If women do have the right information, they may still order a low-quality version of the drug or fail to follow-up as the medication takes effect. A result of this is an increased rate of post-abortion care \u2014 even maternal death.\n\nTo see where treatment rates were highest in the world, study authors Susheela Singh and Isaac Maddow-Zimet of the Guttmacher Institute (GI) analyzed data from a series of existing studies that provided national estimates of the number of women treated for complications of pregnancy. The majority of studies took place between 2008 and 2013. Although the means of data collection varied with each study, Singh and Zimet found that they were able to obtain comparable data on the number of women who received post-abortion care.\n\nAcross 26 countries, post-termination treatment rates were highest among Pakistani and African women, namely women in Kenya, Malawi, and Uganda. By termination, researchers meant women \u201cterminating an unwanted pregnancy before independent viability, typically defined as before 22 weeks.\u201d Any termination deemed unsafe, thus requiring further treatment, means \u201cit was carried out by person lacking the necessary skills or in an environment lacking minimal medical standards, or both.\u201d\n\nResearchers also found that, in Latin America, the Dominican Republic had the highest treatment rates, while the highest regional rate was in South-Central Asia \u2014 Africa was a close second. These rates excluded women who had miscarried. And oftentimes this care was not offered at an affordable price, putting out not only women but their families, too. That said, Singh and Zimet conceded their estimates have \u201cseveral significant limitations.\u201d For one, they\u2019re based on a small number of countries, and in all but a few countries, information on the coverage of these data was sparse or unavailable.\n\n\u201cThe incidence of treatment for complications from unsafe termination of pregnancy continues to be high,\u201d researchers wrote. \u201cAn estimated 6.9 million women were treated for such complications in 2012, an annual treatment rate of 6.9 per 1,000 women aged 15 to 44 years. These results indicate that unsafe termination of pregnancy remains a significant source of morbidity for women in the developing world in 2012.\u201d\n\nCurrently, an approximate 800 women die from preventable causes related to pregnancy and childbirth, with unsafe abortion specifically accounting for eight to 15 percent of maternal deaths. In terms of post-abortion treatment, the study authors estimated the total number of women treated for complications was seven million in 2012.\n\nAccording to GI, abortion is \u201can extremely safe procedure\u201d when performed under the right conditions; fewer than one percent of all U.S. abortion patients experience major complications. But the U.S. is much more developed than Pakistan and Kenya. In fact, the rate of unsafe abortions in developing regions is 16 times higher than the rate in developed regions. That largely has to do with the fact that abortion remains illegal in several developing regions.\n\n\u201cBroader access to safe termination of pregnancy is an additional effective preventive measure,\u201d Singh and Zimet concluded. \u201cReducing unsafe termination of pregnancy would benefit women\u2019s health and the well-being of their families. It would also yield economic gains by improving women\u2019s productivity and by reducing the costs of\u2026 care.\u201d\n\nSource: Singh S and Maddow-Zimet I.
