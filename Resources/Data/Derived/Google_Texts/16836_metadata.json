Mudiay missed his seventh consecutive game with a right ankle sprain that he suffered Dec. 11 against Minnesota. He has been out of a walking boot, though, and did some light shooting during the Nuggets\u2019 shootaround Saturday morning.\n\nGallinari, meanwhile, looks nimble on his feet but remains out. He missed his third consecutive game after spraining his left ankle against New Orleans on Dec. 20.\n\nNuggets coach Michael Malone started talking about Mudiay\u2019s status, then faded into a prediction on when both could return.\n\n\u201cObviously we\u2019re beginning a four in five (four games in five nights) right now,\u201d Malone said. \u201cA guy that\u2019s missed as long as he has, I would not want to plug them in without having them go through a practice. So the odds of either one of those guys playing prior to, maybe, Golden State, in the new year, are probably slim-to-none, but you never know.\u201d\n\nFootnotes. Jameer Nelson (illness) returned to action Saturday, starting at point guard after missing the team\u2019s last game against Phoenix. \u2026 The Nuggets had a team Christmas dinner on Friday night in San Antonio.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Danilo Gallinari, Emmanuel Mudiay need more time with injuries", "title": "Danilo Gallinari, Emmanuel Mudiay need more time with injuries", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/12/26/danilo-gallinari-emmanuel-mudiay-need-more-time-with-injuries/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151120__498086342p1-6.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151120__498086342p1-6.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-26T21:58:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T23:56:59+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Rookie point guard Emmanuel Mudiay and starting small forward Danilo Gallinari both missed Saturday night\u2019s game against San Antonio.\nMudiay missed his seventh consecutive game with a right ankle sprain that he suffered Dec. 11 against Minnesota.\n\u201cObviously we\u2019re beginning a four in five (four games in five nights) right now,\u201d Malone said.\nJameer Nelson (illness) returned to action Saturday, starting at point guard after missing the team\u2019s last game against Phoenix.\nHe missed his third consecutive game after spraining his left ankle against New Orleans on Dec. 20."}
