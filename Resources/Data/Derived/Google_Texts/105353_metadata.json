That documentary series was my pubescent sex education \u2014 at least until I discovered Internet porn a short while later. It was everything they weren\u2019t telling me in those impotent middle-school health classes. As a result, my erotic catalog is disproportionately made up of images from that show \u2014 a stripper shaking her breasts in a man\u2019s face, a couple having sex at a swinging convention, a woman writhing behind glass.\n\nWhen I saw the premiere this week of HBO\u2019s \u201cSex//Now,\u201d a new show being billed as the next \u201cReal Sex,\u201d I had to rewatch those old episodes. I was like a grown man revisiting his first issue of Playboy \u2014 so much of the titillation and mystery was gone. What I was surprised to find was that in hindsight, despite the fact that I sometimes joke about perilously imprinting on \u201cReal Sex\u201d like a horny baby duck, the show wasn\u2019t the worst education. It showed that, despite my health teacher\u2019s insistence to the contrary, sex could be a great many things.\n\nI decided to speak with Chris Moukarbel, the director of the \u201cSex//Now\u201d pilot, which aired Thursday, about his own pubescent relationship with \u201cReal Sex\u201d and how the carnal act has changed since that legendary series.\n\nAs a pre-pubescent, \u201cReal Sex\u201d was my sex education \u2014 and I know I\u2019m not alone in that. I\u2019ve read that you had a similar experience.\n\nI think a lot of people from my generation who didn\u2019t necessarily have access to a lot of the stories and images that are available online now, we looked to television and specifically \u201cReal Sex\u201d for a lot of those stories. HBO\u2019s \u201cReal Sex\u201d was in a lot of ways proto-reality TV. It was radical, not just because of the subject matter but because it was one of the first times people in America were seeing real people and their real stories. So it was seminal in many ways.\n\n[Laughs]\n\nSorry. I didn\u2019t even mean that pun.\n\nSo, what do you remember from watching \u201cReal Sex\u201d as a kid?\n\nObviously the on-the-street interviews made a real impression. The segments were racy or sexy \u2014 or a lot of times they were really not sexy and just plain funny \u2014 but the on-the-street interviews gave people at home insight into what other people\u2019s sex lives could be like. I read this oral history of \u201cReal Sex\u201d that Vulture did and [the show\u2019s producer] Patti Kaplan was talking about her experience \u2014 she really got a sense of how the show was changing popular culture and ideas around sex. When she first started doing her on-the-street interviews, people would be super-shy, super-careful with what they said. After a while, after the show had been on the air for a while, there was a precedent for that kind of confessional experience, so the floodgates opened. Eventually she had to be like, \u201cOK, enough,\u201d and pull the microphone away from people because they had so much to say.\n\nWhat about today\u2019s pubescents? Are they going to watch \u201cSex//Now\u201d to learn about the birds and the bees or are they too immersed in Internet porn to care about the relatively tame titillation found on HBO?\n\nI think a show like this has relevance now almost more than ever. It\u2019s not so much about exposing young people to ideas around sex that they couldn\u2019t access otherwise. Everybody knows it\u2019s all available online and young people have come of age in that culture. What our show sets out to do is essentially curate the Internet. There are so many people out there who want to tell their stories, who want to share what they think about sex culture now. We\u2019re bringing an audience to those subjects and individuals. You can watch in 30 minutes some really fascinating stories and meet individuals you might not be able to immediately find online.\n\nOne of the early episodes of \u201cReal Sex\u201d features a segment on a live call-in \u201ctele-fantasy\u201d show. The technological difference between that and the first episode of \u201cSex//Now\u201d is stunning. But how fundamentally different are these interactions \u2014 the tele-fantasy of the \u201990s and the webcamming of now?\n\nIn a lot of ways that\u2019s why we thought the show should happen now, because so much has changed since they stopped producing \u201cReal Sex.\u201d You take a service like phone sex or even peep shows, there was a really incredible episode about peep shows that I remember coming across and when I saw it I realized there are probably not many peep shows anymore. They used to exist all around Times Square. It was the form of sex entertainment that was least likely to survive the rise of the Internet, because there\u2019s no purpose for it. Why we ended up focusing on camming is that it was the most one-to-one example of how something like that would dematerialize and reform online as this other form of sex entertainment. Camming is essentially a virtual peep show, but instead of the glass wall and the curtain that comes up and down, it\u2019s the glass wall. So it became this interesting metaphor for how different our relationships are and how they\u2019re mediated by technology.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Salon talks with the director of a new HBO documentary show being dubbed the next \"Real Sex\"", "title": "From phone sex to webcamming: Capturing the evolution of sex", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Salon talks with the director of a new HBO documentary show being dubbed the next \"Real Sex\"", "title": "From phone sex to webcamming: Capturing the evolution of sex", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/01/05/from_phone_sex_to_webcamming_capturing_the_evolution_of_sex/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/xxx_webcam.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Salon talks with the director of a new HBO documentary show being dubbed the next \"Real Sex\"", "title": "From phone sex to webcamming: Capturing the evolution of sex", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/xxx_webcam.jpg", "creator": "@TracyClarkFlory", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Tracy Clark-Flory", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Editor's Picks, HBO, Love and Sex, porn, Pornography, Sex", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdebde\"", "article_summary": "As a pre-pubescent, \u201cReal Sex\u201d was my sex education \u2014 and I know I\u2019m not alone in that.\nTopics: Editor's Picks, HBO, Love and Sex, porn, Pornography, Sex, Life NewsThe last time I watched HBO\u2019s \u201cReal Sex,\u201d it was the \u201990s and I was covertly masturbating late at night in my parents\u2019 living room.\nOne of the early episodes of \u201cReal Sex\u201d features a segment on a live call-in \u201ctele-fantasy\u201d show.\nSo, what do you remember from watching \u201cReal Sex\u201d as a kid?\nWhen I saw the premiere this week of HBO\u2019s \u201cSex//Now,\u201d a new show being billed as the next \u201cReal Sex,\u201d I had to rewatch those old episodes."}
