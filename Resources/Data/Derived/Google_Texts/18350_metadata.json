Pew notes the \u201cPartisan Anchors,\u201d those who always vote for one party over the other, are \u201cSteadfast Conservatives\u201d and \u201cBusiness Conservatives\u201d for Republicans and \u201cSolid Liberals\u201d for Democrats.\n\nPew then broke out \u201cLess Partisan, Less Predictable\u201d voters, charting a path to victory for Republicans through a demographic known as \u201cYoung Outsiders,\u201d who are skeptical of big government and socially more progressive, but who tend to side with the Republican Party overall.\n\nPew defines \u201cYoung Outsiders\u201d this way:\n\nYoung Outsiders lean Republican but do not have a strong allegiance to the Republican Party; in fact they tend to dislike both political parties. On many issues, from their support for environmental regulation to their liberal views on social issues, they diverge from traditional GOP orthodoxy. Yet in their support for limited government, Young Outsiders are firmly in the Republicans\u2019 camp.\n\nPOLITICO\u2019s coverage of these results give Republicans \u2014 particularly those who are reaching out to young voters \u2014 electoral hope:\n\nRepublicans\u2019 greatest opportunities \u2014 and challenges \u2014 may lie with the \u201cyoung outsiders,\u201d according to the report. It\u2019s a group that potential 2016 hopefuls such as Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky are already making overtures toward. They lean Republican 53 percent to 33 percent on the generic midterm ballot but are not consistent voters and are wary of government spending. \u201cHowever, the young outsiders\u2019 generational imprint on issues like homosexuality, diversity and the environment make the Republican Party an uncomfortable fit,\u201d Pew said.\n\nPew\u2019s results give Republicans at 53%-33% edge over Democrats among this demographic in the 2014 election. Moreover, Pew reveals:\n\nNonetheless, Young Outsiders may present an attractive opportunity for the GOP. They are younger and more diverse than Republicans generally. Nearly half are under 40, compared with just 33% among all Republicans\u2026 Young Outsiders share Republicans\u2019 deep opposition to increased government spending on social programs. About three-quarters of Young Outsiders (76%) say the government can\u2019t afford to spend more to help the needy.\n\nWhen asked whether \u201cYoung Outsiders\u201d trusted government or not, a whopping 84 percent responded with \u201cOnly some of the time/Never\u201d compared to 16 percent who said \u201cAlways/Most of the time,\u201d and when asked about their feelings about the federal government, 88 percent said they were \u201cAngry\u201d or \u201cFrustrated,\u201d while just 12 percent said they were content.\n\nThe results also revealed \u201cYoung Outsiders\u201d are skeptical of Big Business, whose cozy relationship with Big Government gives them a competitive edge over other businesses.\n\nWhen it comes to military intervention, only 12 percent of \u201cYoung Outsiders\u201d believe the United States should play an active role in world affairs, compared to 85 percent who believe we should focus more on domestic affairs. Interestingly, \u201cSteadfast Conservatives\u201d (what are known as \u201ctraditional\u201d or \u201csocial\u201d conservatives) tend to agree with \u201cYoung Outsiders\u201d on this, while \u201cBusiness Conservatives\u201d are much more supportive of military intervention.\n\nA full 59 percent of \u201cYoung Outsiders\u201d actually believe U.S. involvement overseas tends to make world problems worse. \u201cYoung Outsiders\u201d break from both \u201cSteadfast Conservatives\u201d and \u201cBusiness Conservatives\u201d in supporting good diplomacy (73 percent) over military strength (20 percent) as the best way to ensure peace.\n\nOther interesting findings about \u201cYoung Outsiders\u201d include:\n\nThey disapprove of Obamacare 71%-25%\n\nThey support marijuana legalization 67%-31%\n\nThey support gun rights over gun control 63%-35%\n\nThe wide-ranging survey sheds a lot of light on the partisan breakdown of Americans and allows Republicans to chart a course through \u201cYoung Outsiders\u201d toward political victory.\n\nRepublican focus on young voters through pro-liberty Republicans like Sen. Paul, Congressman Amash and others can maintain a winning coalition that translates to political victory nationally. The GOP should take heed and continue to reach out to young Americans.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "conservative,millennials,Rand Paul,Republican Party,young outsiders,Politics,News,Blog,Current,Alternative,Libertarian,Freedom,Election,Nonpartisan,Ron Paul", "robots": "index,follow", "description": "Rand Paul&#039;s Youth Vote Pew Research Center recently conducted the largest political survey in the center&#8217;s history, questioning more than 10,000 adults between January and March of this year.
