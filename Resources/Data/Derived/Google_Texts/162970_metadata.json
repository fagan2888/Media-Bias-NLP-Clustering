The couple had been high school sweethearts and together for 10 years.\n\n\"Every time I saw him he was soft spoken and he was kind to our family and I know he was easy to talk to,\" said Nye.\n\nWashington's family tells KAKE News they had no idea of any domestic violence issues between the couple that recently broke up.\n\n\"Sometimes those things are kept behind doors because people are ashamed or worried or other things could be happening, but right now we're worried about the girls,\" said Nye.\n\nNye says Washington will be remembered for being fun and bright -- and a loving mother of two young daughters who will now be without their mother and father.\n\n\"Her smile,\" said Nye. \"She had the most beautiful smile.\"\n\nWhile this family never saw the signs, Nye says those struggling with domestic violence need to speak up.\n\n\"Don't be afraid to turn to your family because your family is what's going to be there for you,\" she said.\n\nWashington's family has set up a Go Fund Me account to raise money to provide for her two daughters.
