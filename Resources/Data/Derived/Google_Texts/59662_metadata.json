Right out there in the open, for anyone to see, was a substance estimated to cause 13,000 premature deaths in the U.S. each year, and it was on its way down from Wyoming to do its dirty work in the power plants of America.\n\nThat may sound a little hyperbolic, but that\u2019s a big number \u2014 the equivalent of some 1,444 Dylann Roofs or 1,083 James Holmeses or 4.3 Sept. 11s. And it happens every year, and it\u2019s not just coal.\n\nThe World Health Organization estimates that 1 in 8 deaths worldwide each year are a direct result of all kinds of air pollution, most of which comes from stuff we dug out of the ground to burn for fuel.\n\nThink about that: We dug it out of the ground and burned it for fuel. That\u2019s how we\u2019ve powered our society for a few hundred years, and while that statement may have seemed reasonable in, say, 1885, it makes increasingly little sense today when healthier, less damaging options are becoming more readily available.\n\nYes, I\u2019m aware that I\u2019m burning coal right now to type this column. I also know we\u2019ll need to rely on Stupid Burning Stuff for a few more years as renewable energy becomes more established, efficient and affordable. It\u2019s happening at a quicker pace than we\u2019d imagined even a few years ago, fueled by cheap solar panels, more wind energy, better battery tech, increasing fuel economy standards for cars and other increased regulations.\n\nThese are interesting times, energy-wise. While renewable energy is surging, so, too, is domestic oil and gas production \u2014 due largely to the proliferation of oil and gas produced via the sketchy practice of fracking. And coal, even as its prevalence and influence wanes, is still being dug up, hauled about, shoveled into ovens and burnt for energy all over the world. \u201cClean coal\u201d is a myth, a devious phrase meant to trick us into thinking technology exists that will strip every nasty thing out of that smokestack.\n\nWell, maybe it does, but nobody wants to pay for it.\n\nMeanwhile, coal\u2019s liquid doppelganger continues to spill, blow up, pollute air and water and generally make a mess wherever it goes. Like beer and milk, oil is a substance that seems always to be straining at its container, yearning to be free. It spills willy-nilly in the oceans, lakes and rivers of the world on a regular basis, and yet we\u2019re constantly on the lookout for more places to plunder.\n\nHow about the Arctic? Nothing could go wrong there, right?\n\nOn land, the tankers\u2019 partner in crime, the pipeline, is busily spewing oily muck in various locales: more than 20,000 barrels from the Tesoro pipeline in North Dakota in September, 2013; up to 7,000 barrels of heavy crude from the Exxon Mayflower pipeline in a suburban neighborhood in Arkansas in March, 2013. And just this May, 100,000 gallons of crude oil defiled the waters off Santa Barbara.\n\nAnd then there are all those rail cars full of oil and other scary stuff that have a disturbing proclivity toward the cataclysmic accident. When these things go off the rails and blow up and burn, we can\u2019t even fight the fire. We just have to watch it, black smoke billowing and metal melting and communities terrified for days on end.\n\nIt\u2019s really a terrible idea, after all, this Stupid Burning Stuff. But the writing is on the wall for its imminent demise, despite the best efforts of Big Oil and their climate-change denying stooges in Congress.\n\nIt just can\u2019t come soon enough.\n\n(Cough.)\n\nAlex Miller is a marketing writer in Highlands Ranch.\n\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado Voices: The scourge of Stupid Burning Stuff", "title": "Colorado Voices: The scourge of Stupid Burning Stuff", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/08/28/colorado-voices-the-scourge-of-stupid-burning-stuff/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150828__OP30MILLERp1.jpg", "height": 495}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150828__OP30MILLERp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-28T17:02:07+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T06:22:55+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "It\u2019s really a terrible idea, after all, this Stupid Burning Stuff.\nI also know we\u2019ll need to rely on Stupid Burning Stuff for a few more years as renewable energy becomes more established, efficient and affordable.\nYes, I\u2019m aware that I\u2019m burning coal right now to type this column.\nAnd then there are all those rail cars full of oil and other scary stuff that have a disturbing proclivity toward the cataclysmic accident.\nOn a recent return trip from downtown Denver on the light rail, we rode next to a parked freight train full of coal near Union Station."}
