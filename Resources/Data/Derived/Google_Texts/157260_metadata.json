The information came in a response to an IBTimes question about whether the administration has data about Hispanic enrollment, and if so, why it has not been released. This story has since been updated with a new White House statement.\n\nNatalie Malis was something of a test case: a Latino willing to set aside her misgivings about U.S. government-sponsored health care and dive right in, though ultimately it was more like slogging in after she called in and got put on hold for \u201ca ridiculously long time.\u201d\n\nMost Latinos are too wary to even apply, Malis observed, in part because they don\u2019t trust the government. And, in fact, the Obama administration\u2019s response to questions about Latino involvement does little to inspire anyone\u2019s trust. \u201cThe White House is not telling the truth,\" Marisa Salcines, co-founder of HealthyHispanicLiving.com, bluntly said of the administration\u2019s claim that it doesn\u2019t know how many Latinos have signed up for Obamacare.\n\nPhoto: Reuters\n\nPhoto: REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni Previous Next\n\nSalcines said deep-seated cultural reasons led to the low Hispanic response, but that the administration should take that into account and revise its approach rather than downplay the issue.\n\nMalis, 38, a first generation Cuban-American who lives in Waynesville, N.C., with her husband and two small children, recently signed up for Obamacare and said she is happy with the insurance plan she found for her family. But none of her extended family members or Hispanic friends have signed up.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\n\u201cI found a plan whose premiums are half what we currently pay, but I had to jump through hoops,\u201d Malis said. \u201cYou have to create an account, they put you on hold for a ridiculously long time, and they make you answer a lot of invasive questions. It\u2019s like filing your taxes. Most of the Latino people I know are reluctant to do this.\u201d\n\nLatinos signups are considered crucial to the success of the Affordable Care Act, and approximately 10.2 million who are uninsured have an opportunity to sign up for coverage, according to the Obama administration, which is counting on them to enroll in big numbers. Will they? So far, it doesn\u2019t look too promising. But the White House is not willing to share the early data -- and claims it doesn\u2019t exist.\n\nWhen reached on Friday, a member of the White House media staff said on background that the numbers for Hispanic enrollment had not yet been released and referred IBTimes to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, generally known as CMS, which is a division of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that administers Obamacare.\n\nBut numerous sources say the early numbers are in fact available. Salcines, whose new health care educational platform, HealthyHispanicLiving.com, aims to fill the gap in providing culturally relevant health care information to U.S. Hispanics, said the administration does have access to this information and should be sharing it.\n\n\u201cOn the federal enrollment form, they specifically ask if you are of Latino/Hispanic origin,\u201d she said. \u201cThe White House is not telling the truth. They do have access to ethnicity data. It is voluntary, but it is on the form, and I\u2019m sure this information is being captured in some data table somewhere. If they\u2019re going to market to Hispanics to enroll, and leverage Hispanic language media, how can they not track metrics to gauge campaign effectiveness at the very least?\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, Katherine Vargas, the White House director of Hispanic media, told IBTimes, \u201cWhile applicants may voluntarily report their race or ethnicity, neither applicants nor State-based marketplaces are required to report race and ethnicity at this time. As such, HHS does not yet have reliable and complete data available to report on race and ethnicity at this time. HHS has said they will provide additional metrics when they are available and we expect to be able to provide additional data in the future.\u201d\n\nHHS released some demographic data on early enrollment on Monday that includes age breakdown, but it did not include a racial breakdown. Sherice Perry Dillard, a spokesperson for Health and Human Services, told IBTimes, \u201cWhen we (HHS) have data we will make it available. It\u2019s not fair to say that we are not releasing information. We can do rough estimates, but people still have three months to sign up. A lot of Latinos are still asking questions, which we expected. We estimate that about 70 percent of Latinos will enroll in English, not on the Spanish language site. The [online] system doesn\u2019t distinguish whether someone enrolls on the Spanish language site or the English site.\u201d\n\nSalcines said she isn\u2019t buying that argument, and that while she supports Obamacare, she\u2019s frustrated by the way in which the rollout has been handled, especially for Latinos. She said it would at least be reasonable and easy for the White House to release early enrollment data compiled from people who signed up on CuidadoDeSalud.gov, the Spanish language version of the Obamacare site.\n\nSalcines and several other sources suggest that the White House is mum about the early numbers because its Obamacare team has failed in its outreach to the more than 50 million Hispanics living in the United States.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure there\u2019s great concern that if the real enrollment numbers were released it would be another deterrent to signing up,\u201d Salcines said. \u201cBut not being transparent about this is only going to backfire. Instead, they should increase their outreach. If the administration approached the Hispanic community with the same effort they showed in the last two elections, they would have much better results in getting Hispanics to enroll. This is what makes many Latinos cynical. Bottom line: don\u2019t invite them on a date and then never return their phone calls.\u201d\n\nVargas said the administration has stepped up its efforts in recent weeks to reach out to Hispanics, especially in states such as California, Texas and Florida where large numbers of uninsured Latinos live, and educate them about the various ways they can sign up for the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe White House has dispatched its own officials and Cabinet members to these states, and has contacted community health centers, churches, libraries and other places nationwide where the Latino community congregates, Vargas said. The administration has saturated the Spanish-speaking national media (Univision, Telemundo, etc) with Obamacare information.\n\nIt\u2019s not that Latinos, who have the highest uninsured rate among racial and ethnic groups, with nearly one in three lacking coverage, aren\u2019t showing any interest. Vargas pointed out that the White House received 330,000 calls on the Obamacare Spanish language telephone call center between Oct. 1 and Jan. 7.\n\nJane Delgado, president and CEO of the National Alliance for Hispanic Health, the nation's oldest and largest nonprofit, nonpartisan network of Hispanic health and human service providers, said there is actually great interest in Obamacare among Latinos.\n\n\u201cWe had to hire eight new people to handle the onslaught of phone calls we received after Obamacare was introduced,\u201d she said. \u201cOur help line received more than 10,000 calls from October to November. People are asking about the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nWhile they are calling and asking questions, Delgado said not many are purchasing insurance, at least not yet (the deadline is March 31). Some news accounts suggest this reluctance has to do with language barriers and with the Hispanic community\u2019s fear of immigration and general distrust of the government. But Delgado and others say another significant factor is the less-known but deep-seated cultural disconnect with U.S. health care among Hispanics.\n\nGlenn Llopis, a Hispanic author and founder of the Center for Hispanic Leadership, told IBTimes that the Obama administration doesn\u2019t have a firm grasp of this disconnect.\n\n\u201cThis aspect of Obamacare has not been reported in the media, but Hispanics instinctively do not trust the American medical community. Not only do they not trust the government, they don't trust doctors who have misguided them in the past,\u201d Llopis said. \u201cThe Obama administration just doesn\u2019t understand that professional health care is not something Hispanics are necessarily raised with or see the value in. Only 5 percent of America's doctors are Hispanics, who represent 17 percent of the population, and non-Hispanic doctors are generally not trusted. This is rooted in their cultural heritage. And that, in addition to concerns about giving up too much personal information and being told what to do by the government, is a primary reason why they don\u2019t trust Obamacare.\u201d\n\nDelgado said Latinos\u2019 skepticism about the new law stems largely from the fact that they \u201cstill don\u2019t feel welcome in the American healthcare culture.\u201d\n\nThis unwelcome feeling certainly isn\u2019t helped by the fact that the Spanish language version of the Obamacare website - Cuidadodesalud.gov - has had serious problems and continues to struggle to get up to speed. Parts of it are still not translated to Spanish.\n\n\u201cThe biggest problem with the website, still, is that it does not allow consumers to shop for their insurance plan,\u201d Delgado said. \u201cThis is the kind of thing that upsets the Hispanic community. They are not given the same options of shopping that the main website offers.\u201d\n\nDelgado said there are countless examples that illustrate how American health care is not adequately serving the growing Hispanic market.\n\n\u201cTake hospitals, for example,\u201d she said, \u201cThere are still hospitals that do not allow more than one or two visitors to a room. Well, when a Latino is ill, their entire family will visit the hospital, it is a part of our culture. The newer hospitals are beginning to accommodate this and even have more private rooms. But change comes very slow.\u201d\n\nSalcines said this is all about getting to know the consumer better. \u201cThe Obama administration has simply not done that,\" she said. \"Corporations do multicultural diversity training. The Obama administration needs some of this training to unlock this community. They have done a poor job of getting to know who we are as people.\"\n\nLlopis said there are several things the administration could do differently to unlock this community and attract more Hispanics to Obamacare.\n\n\u201cFor one thing, understanding the culture, attitude, and mindset is key before launching any product, service, or program aimed at Hispanics,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything from the tone and words used in collateral materials, videos, and websites needs to be tailored through the Hispanic cultural lens if true trust and buy-in is to be won.\u201d\n\nLlopis said that despite the fact that Obama\u2019s victory in 2012 was \u201cthe result of the Hispanic vote,\u201d since then he has not continued to value this population as a critical ally \u201cwhose trust you must earn on a daily basis.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s important that the administration build relationships with key local groups and meet with them regularly to better understand the Hispanic perspective, concerns, and needs, Llopis said. \u201cThis familial-style gathering will help cultivate \u2013 in a more culturally relevant way -- the initial trust that the administration must build with the Hispanic community,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to Delgado, the government\u2019s reluctance to release Hispanic data on health care has been going on for decades. For example, she said, the federal government\u2019s health care narrative for so long has been that all minorities have poor health.\n\n\u201cBut that is not true,\u201d Delgado said. \u201cWe finally have data showing that while Hispanics have higher obesity rates and diabetes is a problem, we live longer than non-Hispanic whites and non-Hispanic Blacks, and have less heart disease. CDC (Centers for Disease Control) came out with this three years ago, but it took a very long time.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s apparently not just the White House that is allegedly fudging the facts on Obamacare enrollment. There are new allegations that even members of Congress manipulating the early numbers so things don\u2019t look as bad.\n\nPolitico reported Friday that Republicans in Colorado have accused Sen. Mark Udall (D-Colo.) of having staff members pressure Colorado state officials to change its figures on the number of Obamacare cancelations in the state.\n\nDelgado said it isn\u2019t necessary to manipulate these numbers, at least not with Hispanics. She said that while this national community is apparently not yet enrolling in droves, \u201cI do believe they will ultimately sign up in large numbers across the country by the end of March. Why? Because ultimately this is about helping not just them, but their families.\u201d\n\nSalcines emphasized that the relationship or lack thereof between the administration and US Hispanics is a two-way street.\n\n\u201cAs Hispanics, we haven\u2019t done a good job, either, of being our own healthcare advocates and speaking up,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is why Hispanics need to realize that they have in their communities natural-born leaders, and that they need to invest in themselves more to become what this country needs most: 21st century leaders. Until then, we will continue to devalue our worth in the eyes of the country.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://s2.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "obamacare,affordable healthcare,obama,hispanics,latino,health insurance", "og": {"site_name": "International Business Times", "description": "Is the Obama administration reaching out to Hispanic-Americans effectively?", "title": "The White House Won't Say How Few Hispanics Are Signing Up For Obamacare.
