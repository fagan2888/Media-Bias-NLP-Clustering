"article_text": "The Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, a nonprofit law firm dedicated to preserving religious liberty for people of all faiths, filed a brief to the U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday, asking it to hear the case of the Little Sisters of the Poor.\n\nThe Little Sisters of the Poor, an order of Catholic nuns who provide shelter and health care for the elderly poor, have filed a class action lawsuit against the Obama administration in order to be exempt from an Obamacare provision that requires employers to pay for abortifacient drugs, sterilizations, and contraceptives in their employee health plans.\n\nThe teachings of the Catholic Church forbid the use of abortifacients and artificial birth control, and the nuns have argued that paying for such drugs would be a violation of their conscience.\n\nThe government filed a brief asking the Supreme Court to refuse to hear the Little Sisters\u2019 case and to choose a different case regarding the Health and Human Services Mandate.\n\nThe provision does allow for some religious institutions to be exempt from providing the drugs, but the government has argued that the Little Sisters do not qualify.\n\nIn an interview with The Daily Signal, Daniel Blomberg, legal counsel for The Becket Fund, said the government is making the \u201codd\u201d and \u201cdangerous\u201d argument that the Little Sisters \u201caren\u2019t religious enough\u201d to qualify for the exemption.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to be more religious than the Little Sisters,\u201d Blomberg said. \u201cThe federal government has drawn a discriminatory line between the Little Sisters and the church they serve.\u201d\n\nThe Little Sisters have argued that the order to provide abortifacient drugs violates both the Religious Freedom Restoration Act and the First Amendment.\n\nBlomberg said the Little Sisters \u201cwill never stop being faithful to the Church.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are not planning on letting an overreaching federal government prevent them from caring for the elderly poor,\u201d Blomberg said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Becket Fund for Religious Liberty filed a brief to the U.S. Supreme Court on
