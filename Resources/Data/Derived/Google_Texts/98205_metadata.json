This year\u2019s recipient is James B. Lewis, honored for his \u201clegacy of dedicated leadership and continuing service to the citizens of the State of New Mexico,\u201d Jefferson said.\n\nLewis served as a United States Army military police officer before earning a bachelor of science in education from Bishop College. He came to UNM where he earned a master\u2019s in Public Administration in 1977. He furthered his education with the National College of Business.\n\n\u201cHis education and training prepared him to serve as chief administrative officer for the City of Albuquerque, where he also served as chief of operations. He served as chief of staff for Gov. Bruce King and as director/assistant secretary for the U.S. Department of Energy,\u201d Jefferson said.\n\nRoslyn Brock addresses the audience of more than 400 at the UNM Student Union Building.\n\nBlack History Month Speaker\n\nRoslyn Brock, chair of the National Board of Directors for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, made history in 2010 when she was unanimously elected its 14th chairman. She is the youngest person and only fourth woman to hold this position.\n\nA sought-after speaker, Brock was convocation speaker at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University. Essence magazine listed her among the \u201c40 Fierce and Fabulous Women Who Are Changing the World,\u201d and Black Entertainment Television (BET) honored her in its inaugural broadcast. She also received the 2010 National Urban League\u2019s Women of Power Award.\n\nBrock, a Baptist preacher, noted that the NAACP is both a \u201ccussed and discussed organization.\u201d She asked the audience, as she asked herself, \u201cWhat would I do if I knew I could not fail?\u201d and told them to proceed with that in mind to provide \u201cfull cultural and economic opportunities for our community.\u201d\n\nThis year is the 50th anniversary of Voting Rights Act, which is intended to protect the right to vote regardless of race or color. \u201cIt is not ancient history,\u201d she said. She added that aspects of it were struck down in 2013, allowing nine states \u2013 predominately in the south \u2013 to change their election laws without prior federal approval. \u201cWith this, the African American community is challenged on our right to vote, on our right to live,\u201d Brock said.\n\nShe pointed to the police shootings in Ferguson and Staten Island. \u201cThose killings were not adjudicated in a court of law. We must encourage peaceful protest and protect \u2013 not victimize \u2013 people of color,\u201d Brock said.\n\nShe said the problem with guns is not just from police, but also stems from Black on Black crime. \u201cWe need to raise up the hopes, dreams and expectations of our children so they don\u2019t see violence as the only course of action. Violence is not the answer,\u201d Brock said. \u201cService to others is the rent we pay for the space we occupy.\u201d\n\nBrock said that health care is a social justice issue. \u201cIn Arizona and Kentucky, they are trying to dismantle the Affordable Care Act. Extreme poverty, unequal distribution of wealth contribute to the lack of access to health care,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt is a fact that children with health insurance do better in school and have a vision for the future. Everyone needs to come together to work on the problems in our community,\u201d she said, adding that it is \u201ca crime to spend billions on prisons and smart phones without paying for educate to create smart children,\u201d she said.\n\nFor more on Black History Month at UNM and a schedule of events, visit: Black History Month.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The University of New Mexico Africana Studies program has a long history of bringing in engaging speakers to kick off Black History Month.
