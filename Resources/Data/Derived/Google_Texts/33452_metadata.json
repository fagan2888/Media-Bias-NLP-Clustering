Warren of Kalamazoo was named Consumer Health Advocate of the Year at the annual Families USA Health Action Conference last week in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe award, presented every year since 1998 by Families USA, the national organization for health care consumers, recognizes outstanding contributions made on behalf of the nation\u2019s health care consumers.\n\n\n\n\"The award is being presented to Warren for her work in bringing together diverse groups across the state to forge a common voice and common effort in the fight for quality, affordable health coverage for all Michiganders,\" according to information provided by the organization.\n\n\n\nWarren is community outreach manager for Michigan Consumers for Healthcare, which Warren joined in July 2011. It provides a coordinated voice for Michigan\u2019s consumers in health policy discussions.\n\n\n\nAs community outreach manager, Warren has traveled the state to bring together a coalition of consumers, stakeholders and policy makers to embrace the health coverage opportunities provided by the Affordable Care Act, Families USA stated.
