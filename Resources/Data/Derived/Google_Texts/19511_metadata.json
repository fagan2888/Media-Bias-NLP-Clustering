Buckley Jr. Program at Yale organized the event, which kicked off a series of debates named in honor of the old political TV show, \u201cFiring Line.\u201d Buckley, the late author and National Review founder, was the host of that program.\n\nGingrich and Amar sparred on everything from the Second Amendment to the president\u2019s authority under the War Powers Act, with side trips into NSA snooping and the actions of Russian President Vladimir Putin. The most heated exchange came during debate over the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s striking down of portions of the Voting Rights Act.\n\n\u201cThere are some members of your party who don\u2019t seem so enthusiastic about the right to vote,\u201d Amar said, asserting that some states are making it harder for citizens to cast their vote.\n\n\u201cI am fascinated with the left\u2019s passion about the Voting Rights Act,\u201d Gingrich replied. He argued that Democrats have shown no interest in developing an efficient mechanism that guarantees ballots are being cast by eligible voters.\n\nLike Buckley, Gingrich, 70, is a TV host these days. He recently became co-host of CNN\u2019s retooled \u201cCrossfire\u201d program. He was architect for the 1990s \u201cContract with America,\u201d made a run for the Republican presidential nomination in 2012 and served as Speaker of the House for four years.\n\nGingrich called the vast power of federal agencies a \u201cproto-dictatorship\u201d and said the founding fathers \u201cwould think we were insane\u201d if they saw today\u2019s Internal Revenue Service. He also said that \u201crandomly scooping up\u201d information about U.S. citizens is a \u201cdirect threat to our freedom.\u201d\n\nAmar, Yale\u2019s Sterling professor of law and political science, took issue with what he termed Gingrich\u2019s \u201ccontempt\u201d for the rest of the world, saying, \u201cYou have to take seriously the other democracies of the world.\u201d\n\nAmar said a more \u201crobust\u201d judiciary speaks to the complexity of modern times and noted that the U.S. Supreme Court made the correct decision in upholding the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAlthough Amar made a passing reference to the presidential impeachment of Bill Clinton that marked Gingrich\u2019s time as Speaker (\u201cI\u2019m not such a fan of impeaching, willy-nilly. Been there, done that.\u201d), he did have a compliment for Gingrich.\n\n\u201cYou have a great way with words and you don\u2019t mince them,\u201d Amar said.\n\nCall Jim Shelton at 203-789-5664.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Education, Education news, New Haven Education news, CT Education news, US Education news, world Education news.", "title": "It was Gingrich vs. Amar, at Yale", "og": {"url": "http://www.nhregister.com/general-news/20130916/it-was-gingrich-vs-amar-at-yale", "image": {"width": "1500px", "identifier": "http://www.nhregister.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/NH/20130916/NEWS/130919527/AR/0/AR-130919527.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "920px"}, "type": "article", "title": "It was Gingrich vs. Amar, at Yale"}, "twitter": {"domain": "nhregister.com", "description": "NEW HAVEN >> Conservative icon Newt Gingrich headlined a semantics showdown at Yale Monday night, debating the lessons of the U.S. Constitution with a respected Yale professor.", "title": "It was Gingrich vs. Amar, at Yale", "url": "http://www.nhregister.com/general-news/20130916/it-was-gingrich-vs-amar-at-yale", "image": {"src": "http://www.nhregister.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/NH/20130916/NEWS/130919527/AR/0/AR-130919527.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@nhregister", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id568468308", "iphone": "id520203861", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.newhavenregister"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"admins": 18506000}, "keywords": "Education, Education news, New Haven Education news, CT Education news, US Education news, world Education news.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "NEW HAVEN >> Conservative icon Newt Gingrich headlined a semantics showdown at Yale Monday night, debating the lessons of the U.S. Constitution with a respected Yale professor."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca7eb\"", "article_summary": "NEW HAVEN >> Conservative icon Newt Gingrich headlined a semantics showdown at Yale Monday night, debating the lessons of the U.S. Constitution with a respected Yale professor.\n(Arnold Gold \u2014 New Haven Register) Newt Gingrich debates with Yale University professor of law and political science Akhil Reed Amar on the topic, What are the lessons of the Constitution?\"\nLike Buckley, Gingrich, 70, is a TV host these days.\nGingrich and Amar sparred on everything from the Second Amendment to the president\u2019s authority under the War Powers Act, with side trips into NSA snooping and the actions of Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nAdvertisementYale\u2019s Akhil Reed Amar, a lauded Constitutional law scholar, countered that the history of the Constitution is a history of greater national, liberal and egalitarian government."}
