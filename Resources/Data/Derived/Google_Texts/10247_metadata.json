While the left-leaning journalists are tossing around words like \"propaganda\" to describe the official photos which are being released, the recent trip President Obama took to South Africa for the funeral of Nelson Mandela illustrates that the media elite really isn't interested in news so much as it is in preserving its institutional power.\n\nPerhaps the most-discussed news item out of the Mandela funeral trip was a picture that was taken of Obama, British prime minister David Cameron, and Danish prime minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt taking a \u201cselfie\u201d -- a self-portrait usually shot with a hand-held digital camera or camera phone -- a moment that was caught by Roberto Schmidt, a photographer for the French Press Agency. Now, Schmidt says that the overwhelming interest in the shot makes him \u201cashamed of mankind.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn an article for National Review Online, Laura Bennett stated: \u201cThe big news from yesterday\u2019s Mandela memorial was not a rousing speech or particularly moving tribute. It was a photo, captured late in the ceremony\u201d of the three world leaders with their \u201cfaces smushed together.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAs soon as the photo appeared online, the Internet pounced,\u201d Bennett stated. \u201c'Selfie Diplomacy' trumpeted NBC News. 'President Takes Selfie at Mandela Funeral. Inappropriate?' wondered the Christian Science Monitor. 'Critics Click Over Obama Selfie Saga,' the Boston Herald declared.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe also noted:\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see why the photo blew up on the web. There are plenty of apparent dynamics to parse. Cameron leans in like a goofy uncle trying to join the party. Obama bites his lip coolly. Thorning-Schmidt, mouth slightly agape, has the self-consciously expectant face of so many selfie-takers before her.\n\n\n\nAnd off to one side, Michelle appears to be fuming but is probably just not paying attention.\n\nSchmidt, the AFP's chief photographer for South Asia, asked: \u201cWhy do people care about a selfie? This is a sad reflection of our society.\"\n\n\n\nBennett noted that he\u2019d gone to the memorial \u201cwith a team of 10 photographers. They moved some 500 pictures ages on the wire.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cGood images, nice, strong images,\" he continued. \u201cImages of South Africans dancing, smiling, chanting, which is the way they express mourning for a man they consider to be their father.\u201d\n\n\n\nSchmidt dutifully clicked away. \u201cThey\u2019re in front of you, this happens, you take the picture,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I saw so many good images from that memorial. And the picture that\u2019s getting played is the president in a selfie. That\u2019s kind of a bummer.\u201d\n\n\n\nEd Driscoll of PJMedia.com decided to translate that phrase from its use in the \u201cmainstream media\u201d into common English:\n\nI broke news -- I\u2019m a successful wire service photog! But I broke news that made Mr. Obama look bad. I\u2019ll never hear the end of this from my peers standing around the Monsieur Coffee machine in the AFP break room in their Paris HQ.\n\n\n\nI am a failure of a photographer. I\u2019ll never be stupid enough to break news again. Mon Dieu! Where did it all go wrong?\n\nSo one wire service photographer is ashamed he took a photo that \u201cmade the most powerful man in the world look silly,\u201d Driscoll stated. \u201cWhich rather nicely sums up the stenographic attitude of today\u2019s left-wing palace guard 'journalists.' (But then, the media never really bought into that century-old nonsense they used to tell their readers about 'comforting the afflicting and afflicting the comfortable,' did they?)\u201d\n\n\n\nAlong those lines, NewsBusters previously reported CBS's Sharyl Attkisson tweeted that the White House Correspondents Association, along with \"dozens of associations & media outlets,\" sent a letter of protest to White House Press Secretary Jay Carney in mid-November.\n\n\n\nAttkisson charged that the Obama administration was engaged in a \u201ctroubling break from tradition\u201d by restricting the access of photojournalists at certain presidential events \"while releasing government photos and videos of the same events.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cJournalists are routinely being denied the right to photograph or videotape the president while he is performing his official duties,\u201d the letter stated. \u201cAs surely as if they were placing a hand over a journalist's camera lens, officials in this administration are blocking the public from having an independent view of important functions of the Executive Branch of government.\u201d\n\nEven if that is true, which it appears to be, judging by the actual conduct and statements from Schmidt and others, it is hard to see how the pictures taken by the overwhelmingly left-leaning White House press corps are really all that different from the official ones, a point which even the liberal website Gawker acknowledged last month in a post headlined \"Exposed: Obama Image Machine Won't Let Press Take Flattering Photos.\"", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "NewsBusters", "description": "Right now, the White House press corps is in a shouting match with the Obama Administration over the White House's refusal to allow media photographers to take pictures of various presidential events.
