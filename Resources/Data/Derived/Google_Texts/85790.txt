BOSTON (AP) â€” The Boston Public Library is marking the 400th anniversary of William Shakespeare's death by showcasing rare editions of his works from the library's expansive collection.

Shakespeare died 400 years ago Saturday.

The library will begin displaying early editions of "A Midsummer Night's Dream" ''Hamlet" and "The Merchant of Venice" later this year.

It will also display four folios of Shakespeare's collected works, including a copy of the First Folio, published in 1623 and considered to be an important source text for dozens of his plays.

The free exhibit will run from October 13 to March 31, 2017, and is sponsored by Iron Mountain, a Boston-based storage and information management services company.

The Boston Public Library says it holds one of the largest collections of Shakespeare for a public institution.
