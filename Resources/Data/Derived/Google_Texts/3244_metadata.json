We expect the main beneficiaries of the Relief Act will be:\n\nSBIC advisers who were required to register with the SEC because they also advise either venture capital funds or private funds;\n\nadvisers to venture capital funds and smaller private equity funds that are interested in launching SBIC funds but have avoided or delayed doing so due to the added expense and operational burdens of becoming an SEC registered investment adviser; and\n\nSBIC-only advisers who are registered under state law because they are located in states that have not adopted exemptions to investment adviser registration analogous to the Advisers Act.\n\nRelief for advisers to both SBICs and Venture Capital Funds\n\nPrior to enactment of the Relief Act, Section 203(l) of the Advisers Act provided that an investment adviser that advises only venture capital funds would be an exempt reporting adviser under the Advisers Act, and Section 203(b)(7) of the Advisers Act provided that an investment adviser that advises only SBICs would be exempt from all reporting and registration requirements of the Advisers Act. However, an investment adviser that advised both venture capital funds and SBICs could not take advantage of either exemption and would be required to register with the SEC.\n\nThe Relief Act has patched this hole by amending Section 203(l) of the Advisers Act to expressly include SBICs as \u201cventure capital funds\u201d for purposes of the venture capital fund adviser exemption. As a result advisers to that advise only SBICs and venture capital funds can rely on the venture capital fund exemption, and therefore need only register with the SEC as exempt reporting advisors.\n\nRelief for advisers to SBICs and Private Funds.\n\nAs adopted, Section 203(m) of the Advisers Act provided that investment advisers to private funds with aggregate assets under management of less than $150,000,000 would be exempt reporting advisers. Prior to the enactment of the Relief Act, the SEC interpreted Section 203(m) to include in the calculation of assets under management the assets of any SBIC that also qualified as a private fund (without any deductions for SBA leverage). If the assets of an SBIC caused the investment adviser\u2019s aggregate assets under management to exceed $150,000,000, the investment adviser could not rely on the private fund adviser exemption.\n\nThe Relief Act rectifies this situation by excluding the assets of SBIC funds from the assets under management calculation. Thus, under the revised regulations, a private fund adviser can advise SBICs of any size and still qualify for the private fund adviser exemption so long as the adviser\u2019s aggregate private fund assets under management are less than $150,000,000.\n\nPreemption of State Registration Requirements for SBIC Advisers\n\nPrior to the enactment of the Relief Act, SBIC fund advisers that were eligible for the SBIC fund adviser exemption under Section 203(b)(7) would still be subject to state investment adviser registration requirements unless a state exemption was also available.[4] While many states have adopted exemptions from investment adviser registration analogous to the SBIC fund adviser, venture capital fund and private fund adviser exemptions of the Advisers Act, not every state has done so, and several states have adopted exemptions similar to the private fund adviser and venture capital fund adviser exemptions (with analogous \u201cexempt reporting adviser\u201d registration and reporting requirements), but not the SBIC fund adviser exemption. As a result, SBIC fund-only located in states that have not adopted a state-level SBIC fund adviser exemption have been subject to some level of registration despite being completely exempt from federal regulation.\n\nThe Relief Act amends Section 203A(b)(1) of the Advisers Act to preempt states from requiring advisers relying on the SBIC fund adviser exemption to register, license or qualify as an investment adviser in the state. While advisers that qualify for the SBIC fund adviser exemption remain subject to SEC and state regulatory authority for anti-fraud purposes, they are no longer required to register or report at either the state or federal level, and may withdraw their SEC registrations or file their final exempt reporting adviser report with the SEC, as applicable.\n\nNext Steps\n\nFederal and state registered or exempt reporting advisers that advise only SBICs should consider withdrawing their registrations or filing their final exempt reporting adviser reports.\n\nSBIC-only advisers relying on the SBIC fund adviser exemption may want to consider launching venture capital or smaller private equity funds given the reduced burdens of registering as exempt reporting advisers.\n\nConversely, advisers relying on either the venture capital fund adviser or the private fund adviser exemption may want to consider exploring the benefits of launching an SBIC.[5]\n\n\\\n\n[1] The Relief Act was enacted on December 4, 2015, as part of H.R. 22, the Fixing America\u2019s Surface Transportation Act of 2015.\n\n[2] 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 80b-1 through 80b-21.\n\n[3] Title IV of the Dodd-Frank legislation was the \u201cPrivate Fund Investment Advisers Registration Act of 2010,\u201d which, among other things, added the various exemptions to the Advisers Act that have been addressed by the Relief Act.
