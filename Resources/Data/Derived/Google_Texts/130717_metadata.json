And this year, it\u2019s weighing environmental concerns along with nutritional needs.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have kids eating what\u2019s best for the environment, not what\u2019s best for them,\u201d says @DarenBakst\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture calls these guidelines the \u201ccornerstone of federal nutrition policy and nutrition education activities.\u201d But critics say that the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee has misplaced priorities by including environmental factors.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, the panel has advised that U.S. consumers should consume less meat because plant-based diets are \u201cassociated with lesser environmental impact than is the current average U.S. diet.\u201d\n\nChairwoman Barbara Millen said at the committee\u2019s first meeting its purpose was to \u201cmake recommendations for a healthy, ecologically responsible diet.\u201d\n\nThe guidelines impact a significant number of federal food programs. The standards of some of these programs\u2014such as the Healthy Hunger Free Kids Act\u2014must be made consistent with the latest dietary guidelines.\n\nCritics are concerned that in the final version of the guidelines, the nutritional needs of Americans will be overlooked in an effort to be environmentally friendly.\n\nDaren Bakst, a research fellow in agricultural policy at The Heritage Foundation, called the committee\u2019s recommendations \u201cdangerous.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf this environmental hijacking of the guidelines is left unaddressed,\u201d Bakst said, \u201cthe nutritional health of children, and the public generally, could be weighed against the political agenda of environmental special interests.\u201d\n\nBakst warned that \u201cthe dietary guidelines may soon be based on global warming as much as human nutrition.\u201d\n\n\u201cDietary guidelines should be based on nutrition, based on what\u2019s healthy for people to eat,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat happens when environmental factors comes into conflict with nutritional factors? Who wins out? You\u2019re going to have kids eating what\u2019s best for the environment, not what\u2019s best for them.\u201d\n\nJanet Riley, senior vice president of public affairs at the North American Meat Institute, told the Washington Post a change in guidelines could make a \u201chuge impact\u201d on what Americans eat.\n\n\u201cThe federal feeding programs are significantly impacted by the federal dietary guidelines,\u201d she said. The group has argued the advisory panel shouldn\u2019t consider sustainability because \u201cit is not within the committee\u2019s expertise.\u201d\n\nThe committee\u2014while operating in an advisory role\u2014is still influential in determining what the final guidelines will be. The final version of the 2015 guidelines is expected later this year.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A government advisory committee will soon issue its recommendations for the 2015 dietary guidelines.
