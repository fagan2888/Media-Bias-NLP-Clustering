Originally hurt three weeks earlier, against Sacramento on Nov. 5, Foye didn\u2019t think it was anything beyond soreness. He played \u2014 and played well \u2014 in a loss to Cleveland at Pepsi Center, scoring 28 points, but had begun to miss some subsequent practices and shootarounds as it got more sore.\n\nAfter missing road games at Indiana and New York with what was then thought to be a right knee injury, Foye said he felt better when he returned.\n\nWhen he took the court against the Lakers on Sunday, Foye said: \u201cIt was the best I felt since the Cleveland game. It was still affecting my shot a little bit. I could tell when I pushed off.\u201d\n\nAnd then, late in the game, he tweaked it.\n\nOn Monday, he asked to get an MRI.\n\n\u201cI knew something was wrong,\u201d Foye said.\n\nThat MRI revealed the tear. The treatment is basically rest. There is no surgery involved, he said. Foye, one of the Nuggets\u2019 top reserves, is averaging 8.4 points and 2.0 assists per game and is shooting 34 percent from 3-point range.\n\nExpect to see more of Gary Harris, or possibly Alonzo Gee, in Foye\u2019s absence, depending on how coach Brian Shaw wants to rotate his bench.\n\nShaw will have other rotation issues to think about with the absence of center JaVale McGee as well. An X-ray taken on McGee\u2019s surgically repaired left tibia came back negative, but the big man has been experiencing pain in the shin.\n\n\u201cJaVale will be out tonight and maybe the next couple of games as well, for that shin area to kind of calm down,\u201d Shaw said. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything structurally wrong. He came down kind of flat-footed (on a play against the Lakers) and he felt the pain radiate up through his shin area.\n\n\u201cThe other 13 guys will be available. JaVale and Randy will be on the inactive list and we\u2019ll just have to go at it with (the rest) of them.\u201d\n\nChristopher Dempsey: cdempsey@denverpost.com or at twitter.com/dempseypost", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Nuggets\u2019 Randy Foye (quad) to miss 3 weeks; JaVale McGee out vs. Bulls", "title": "Nuggets\u2019 Randy Foye (quad) to miss 3 weeks; JaVale McGee out vs. Bulls", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/11/25/nuggets-randy-foye-quad-to-miss-3-weeks-javale-mcgee-out-vs-bulls/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141125__randy-foye-nuggets-112514p1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141125__randy-foye-nuggets-112514p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-25T12:38:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T16:32:18+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd13fa\"", "article_summary": "Nuggets shooting guard Randy Foye is out three weeks due to a small tear in his right quad, he said Tuesday.\nOriginally hurt three weeks earlier, against Sacramento on Nov. 5, Foye didn\u2019t think it was anything beyond soreness.\n\u201cI knew something was wrong,\u201d Foye said.\nWhen he took the court against the Lakers on Sunday, Foye said: \u201cIt was the best I felt since the Cleveland game.\nFoye, one of the Nuggets\u2019 top reserves, is averaging 8.4 points and 2.0 assists per game and is shooting 34 percent from 3-point range."}
