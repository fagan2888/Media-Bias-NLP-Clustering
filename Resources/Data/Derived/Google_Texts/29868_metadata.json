You walk through that door and it impresses. It's expensive, but not as expensive as an aircraft carrier,\" Caulfield said.\n\nThe neighborhood, now known as Cubanacan, was called Country Club Park when it was built. The 5-acre (2-hectare) plot has a swimming pool and tennis court.\n\n\"Not bad for public housing,\" Caulfield said.\n\nThe highest ranking official to previously stay there was Vice President Richard Nixon in 1955.\n\nAccording to lore, it was built as a winter White House for President Franklin Roosevelt, who used a wheelchair.\n\nWhile the State Department could not confirm that, the elevator, ramps and wide doorways made it wheelchair-friendly 50 years before the Americans With Disabilities Act required such features in government buildings.\n\n(Reporting by Daniel Trotta; Editing by Tom Brown)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/03/18/US-mansion-where-Obama-stay-Havana-built-impress", "site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "type": "article", "description": "HAVANA (Reuters) - The mansion in Havana where U.S.", "title": "Mansion where Obama to stay in Havana 'built to impress'"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/03/18/US-mansion-where-Obama-stay-Havana-built-impress", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "HAVANA (Reuters) - The mansion in Havana where U.S.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "HAVANA (Reuters) - The mansion in Havana where U.S. President Barack Obama and his family will spend two nights has survived war, revolution and an Albanian occupation.\nWhile the State Department could not confirm that, the elevator, ramps and wide doorways made it wheelchair-friendly 50 years before the Americans With Disabilities Act required such features in government buildings.\nAccording to lore, it was built as a winter White House for President Franklin Roosevelt, who used a wheelchair.\nObama, Michelle Obama, their two daughters and the first lady's mother will stay there Sunday and Monday nights during the first visit by a U.S. president to Cuba in 88 years.\nThe State Department bought the land and built the residence as America was being drawn into World War Two and sought the profile of a nation on the rise."}
