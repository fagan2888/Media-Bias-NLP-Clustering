(AP Photo/Jon Elswick, File) Associated Press\n\nIt\u2019s not a news flash that health insurance can be complex and confusing. But the health insurance maze can be a problem, especially if you have never had health insurance before or have not had it for a long time. That\u2019s the case for about half of the uninsured and for many people enrolling in the new insurance marketplaces set up under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nConsider:\n\nPeople gaining coverage also have to understand the intricacies of provider networks in the plans they choose, especially if they have a health problem requiring specialty care. Otherwise, they could face high out-of-pocket costs to see out of network providers. It can also be important to understand how drug coverage is tiered \u2013 with brand-name drugs costing much more than generics \u2013 if people are dependent on expensive drugs.\n\nSocial scientists call this \u201chealth insurance literacy.\u201d People need to know how to read and write in order to function as citizens and in today\u2019s economy. But with almost everyone now required to have health coverage they also need to know how health insurance works.\n\nThe newly covered will learn as they go, sometimes with help from family members and friends. The news media \u2013 people\u2019s main source of information on the ACA and health issues \u2013 have a big role to play. Government at all levels, community organizations, health care institutions and health professionals all have a role to play. Unfortunately, we all get tested on our knowledge every time we choose a plan, go to the doctor or fill a prescription.\n\nDrew Altman is president and chief executive officer of the Kaiser Family Foundation.
