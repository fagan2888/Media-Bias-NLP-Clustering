The company was forced to pay the worker back wages.\n\nIn the vast majority of cases, Labor Department investigators found merit in the nursing mothers' complaints. In many instances, bosses weren't aware of all their obligations under the law and they quickly agreed to comply. In others, their actions were more egregious.\n\nAmong the more visible companies whose workers' complaints were ultimately substantiated were Starbucks, Walmart, Dollar General, Dillard's, Sunglass Hut, Meijer, Outback, Anthropologie, Lowe's and the Salvation Army. McDonald's had two such claims filed against it -- one by the worker at the corporate-owned store in Nebraska, another by an employee at a franchise in California. The company didn't respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe case files show that moms who work outside the home face a predicament. They are told by health professionals and society at large that breastfeeding is the right thing for themselves and their babies , with the American Academy of Pediatrics recommending breastfeeding exclusively for the first six months of the baby's life. Yet women still aren't always granted the on-the-job flexibility they need to make it work. But they have to try, because the Family and Medical Leave Act covers only 12 weeks of unpaid leave.\n\nThe nursing-mothers provision covers only those hourly workers who fall under the Fair Labor Standards Act , the same set of employees who are eligible for minimum wage and overtime protections. Many salaried workers are currently exempt from the law. The complaints filed by workers therefore tilted heavily toward the low-wage end of the economy, particularly the retail sector.\n\nThe McDonald's file was one of 105 cases reviewed by The Huffington Post as part of a Freedom of Information Act request for investigations into nursing-mother complaints. The cases spanned from March 2010, when the Obamacare provision went into effect, until late 2013, and only closed investigations were released. The names of the women who filed the complaints were redacted, but the names of the companies and their officers were not.\n\nAs a result of the investigation, McDonald's agreed to pay back wages to the worker and restore her hours. The company also agreed to set up a portable tent in the break room to provide her with a space for pumping milk out of co-workers' view. The investigator determined that the violations were not intentional, but were instead \"due to naivety of the front line manager.\"\n\nHer manager dropped her hours from 20 to 7.25 for at least one week, a schedule change the investigator deemed an \"apparent retaliatory action\" in response to the worker's complaints.\n\nThe woman was forced to clock out and walk 15 minutes each way to a public library whenever she needed to pump milk. This was worse than inconvenient -- it was financially damaging. The investigator determined that the worker had lost $81.24 due to those trips to the library.\n\nThe worker filed a complaint with the Labor Department , saying her rights as a nursing mother were being violated. Within days, a manager forbade her from pumping milk anywhere in the restaurant, according to the Labor Department investigator's findings.\n\nEven though she obtained a doctor's note stating she needed to express milk for her child -- at her manager's insistence -- the woman wasn't given access to a private room. The employee break room had no door or curtain to keep people from walking in on her, so she was forced into the restaurant's public bathroom.\n\nHer right to do so was protected under federal law, as a provision of the Affordable Care Act , better known as Obamacare. Under the 2010 law, employers must give eligible employees \"reasonable\" break times to express milk for a nursing baby, for up to a year after the baby's birth. They must also provide a clean, private location that isn't a bathroom. The law considers bathrooms an unsanitary place to handle what is, after all, food for an infant.\n\nIn February 2012, a fast-food worker returned to her job at a McDonald's restaurant in Grand Island, Nebraska, after three months of maternity leave. As a nursing mother, she was determined to continue breastfeeding. As a working mother, that meant she would have to pump her breast milk at work, store it and then take it home to her baby.\n\nFor a law that covers millions of workers, 105 cases investigated and closed over the course of three years by no means proves there are rampant violations. The relatively small number of complaints might indicate an effective rollout of the regulation. But there's good reason to believe that the hurdles these women faced are, in fact, more common than the numbers suggest.\n\nAwareness of the law is extremely low, and many women don't know they have federal rights as nursing mothers, according to the findings of a recent HuffPost/YouGov poll. Only 25 percent of respondents correctly said that employers with at least 50 employees are required under the law to provide workers with a space for pumping breast milk. A larger share -- 37 percent -- incorrectly said that no such law exists. And the largest share of all -- 38 percent -- admitted they didn't know enough to say one way or the other. Women were only slightly more likely than men to be familiar with the requirement.\n\nThere's another reason to believe the difficulties may be more common than they seem: The women who pursue federal complaints against their bosses must be willing to sacrifice anonymity, since everyone at work knows who the new mother is. Some women who filed complaints actually abandoned them after realizing their bosses would have to be interviewed by investigators.\n\nThe Labor Department's cases share some clear patterns:\n\nMany women ended up pumping milk in the bathroom, which, even if clean and spacious, is still a bathroom. Consider the travails of an employee of Sodexo, the food and services company, who was \"instructed to use an employee bathroom,\" according to an investigator's report. This arrangement apparently necessitated sitting on the bathroom floor. The woman tried switching to a public restroom in the building, which was \"frequented by others\" while she expressed milk. The woman eventually switched back to using the employee restroom \"due to a sewage problem\" with the public one. In an email, a Sodexo spokesman said the company has had a nursing-mothers policy in place since 2004 and updated it in 2010. \"[N]ursing mothers will have access to a suitable private space and be provided with reasonable break times ... to both express and store breast milk,\" he wrote.\n\nIn cases where women weren't given a private space, colleagues and even customers walked in on them while they had their breasts exposed. This was most common for those relegated to common-area break or storage rooms. For instance, a worker at a nursing home in Washington state was instructed to use a supply room, where she sat on top of a garbage can to pump milk. Even though the door had a lock, colleagues with spare keys often walked in on her while searching for supplies. She was later moved to another storage area where the same thing happened repeatedly, the investigator determined.\n\nSome women said they weren't allowed enough time to pump, even though under the law, employers don't have to pay them for the time if breaks aren't normally paid. At a HealthSouth rehab center in Memphis, Tennessee, for example, an employee alleged that managers wouldn't provide a co-worker to cover for her when she was pumping. As a result, she was \"constantly interrupted by intercom pages that a certain patient's room needed her attention or she was needed at the desk,\" according to the report. Because she couldn't get the time she needed, she said, her body stopped producing milk. HealthSouth didn't respond to a request for comment.\n\nHaving a strong corporate policy on nursing mothers doesn't mean it's always followed. Meijer, the Midwestern grocer and retailer, had two substantiated complaints filed against it -- one in which a worker said she wasn't given enough break time, another in which a worker said she didn't always have access to a private office. A Meijer spokesman said that the company has a corporate policy accommodating nursing mothers that predates Obamacare and that all its facilities have areas designated for pumping.\n\nEven when breaks were provided, some women weren't always allowed to pump when their bodies demanded it, which also undermines milk production. The worker at the McDonald's franchise in California said she was told by her supervisor that she could take a break to pump \"only if the restaurant was not busy,\" in the words of the investigator.\n\nMerely raising the issue with a supervisor can create tension. In a small number of cases, workers had their hours cut or were written up after demanding break time or a private room. One woman at a call center in West Virginia was given the break time she needed for pumping but was \"penalized with write-ups which would eventually have resulted in termination,\" the investigator found. The company's human resources manager said she hadn't known about the new requirements.\n\nDespite the public's growing awareness and acceptance of the needs of nursing mothers -- and despite what she considers a strong federal law on the books -- Dr. Joan Younger Meek, a professor of clinical sciences at the Florida State University College of Medicine, said she wasn't surprised to hear about the challenges women faced on the job.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.expire_date": "2014-07-25 07:35:55 -0400", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "title": "The Horrifying Struggles Of Breastfeeding Moms Who Need To Pump At Work", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/07/24/breastfeeding-pumping-at-work_n_5610554.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1926991/images/o-NURSING-MOTHERS-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1926991/images/o-NURSING-MOTHERS-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "creator": "jamieson", "site": "@HuffPostParents", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "The Horrifying Struggles Of Breastfeeding Moms Who Need To Pump At Work"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-07-24 07:35:55 -0400", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=5610554", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "parents", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "obamacare breastfeeding,breastfeeding,working mothers,breast pumping,breastfeeding at work,breastfeeding moms,Carolyn Maloney,obamacare,Affordable Care Act,breastfeeding laws,Jeff Merkley", "article": {"section": "Parents", "tag": "obamacare breastfeeding,breastfeeding,working mothers,breast pumping,breastfeeding at work,breastfeeding moms,Carolyn Maloney,obamacare,Affordable Care Act,breastfeeding laws,Jeff Merkley", "published_time": "2014-07-24 07:35:55 -0400", "modified_time": "2014-07-29 10:59:04 -0400"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "article_summary": "In the vast majority of cases, Labor Department investigators found merit in the nursing mothers' complaints.\nThe woman was forced to clock out and walk 15 minutes each way to a public library whenever she needed to pump milk.\nAmong the more visible companies whose workers' complaints were ultimately substantiated were Starbucks, Walmart, Dollar General, Dillard's, Sunglass Hut, Meijer, Outback, Anthropologie, Lowe's and the Salvation Army.\nA Meijer spokesman said that the company has a corporate policy accommodating nursing mothers that predates Obamacare and that all its facilities have areas designated for pumping.\nHaving a strong corporate policy on nursing mothers doesn't mean it's always followed."}
