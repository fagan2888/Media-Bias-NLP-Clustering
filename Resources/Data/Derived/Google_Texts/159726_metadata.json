Related During 1st-ever 'Worldwide Troop Talk,' Carter tackles servicemembers' questions\n\nDefense Secretary Ash Carter\u2019s \u201cForce of the Future\u201d initiative is expected to include a unique Defense Digital Services office that, within a year, would hire up to 100 top designers, developers and engineers from government and Silicon Valley to launch a new era of digital innovation across the Department of Defense, internal documents explain.\n\nDefense Digital Services will \u201crecruit top talent from the private sector, coordinate technical innovation activities\u201d department-wide and \u201crapidly deliver new tools and practices that are reusable, cut costs and improve user experience,\u201d according to Reform Proposal 1 of the near-final packet of 29 personnel initiatives to be presented to Carter soon.\n\nBrad Carson, acting under secretary of defense for personnel and readiness, who led the months-long effort to shape the Force of the Future package, decided to remove references to the digital services office being housed in an \u201cinnovation bunker in the heart of the Pentagon\u201d as perhaps a bit too dramatic.\n\nBut the digital services team is to be located both deep inside the Pentagon and in a separate office in Silicon Valley, nickname for an area south of San Francisco that is home to the world\u2019s largest high-tech firms.\n\nCarter, a physicist who at one time served as under secretary of defense for acquisition, technology and logistics, and later on boards of directors for large technology companies, is keenly aware of the army of technical experts working in Silicon Valley and at other technology hubs.\n\n\u201cI'm trying to build bridges to those folks,\u201d Carter explained Tuesday while hosting a worldwide \u201ctroop talk\u201d over the internet and social media from Fort Meade, Md. \u201cSome of them don't know us because, remember, only a small slice of our society these days serves. And so I'm trying to connect us to them so we have their best ideas and their best technology.\u201d\n\nA few days earlier Carter showed his interest in partnering with Silicon Valley by announcing funding of an industry innovation institute that will propel development of hybrid electronics, an emerging technology that will enhance war fighting through use of lightweight and shapeable sensors.\n\nCarter described science fiction-like scenarios in which sensors are built into the shape of ships and aircraft to give instant feedback on damage, ground troops wear flexible sensors in clothing to lighten loads and enhance battlefield awareness, and wounded warriors \u201cbenefit from smart prosthetics that have the full flexibility of human skin.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe reality [is] we don\u2019t know all the applications this new technology will make possible. That\u2019s the remarkable thing about innovation,\u201d he said, \u201cand it\u2019s another reason why America and [our] military must get there first.\u201d\n\nHybrid electronics is just one field of digital technology, Carter said. He alluded to advances possible in many others during a speech Tuesday to The American Legion national convention in Baltimore.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about the best technology. You know we need the best people, too. So we\u2019re drilling tunnels through the wall that sometimes seems to separate government from the innovative private sector \u2013 so more of America\u2019s brightest minds can contribute to our mission, even if for a time.\u201d\n\nForce of the Future background papers describing the proposed Defense Digital Services office finds fault with the department\u2019s current \u201cinternal capacity and talent to deliver digital services\u201d that can meet public expectations or long-term national security requirements.\n\n\u201cOver the past three decades, federal agencies have increasingly outsourced their \u2018tech brain\u2019 \u2014 at the same time relying on antiquated digital development techniques and procurement processes to meet rapidly challenging user expectations and marketing conditions,\u201d the papers explain.\n\n\u201cThese conditions led to the recent Healthcare.gov fiasco\u201d during implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act \u201cand the Office of Personnel Management security breach\u201d that allowed millions of U.S. government personnel records to be stolen, most likely by China.\n\n\u201cCompared to an industry that redefines itself every 18 months, existing DOD approaches are neither agile nor competitive with respect to cost, speed and quality,\u201d the background papers contend.\n\nIn arguing for a new \u201chub\u201d of experts with new authorities, the proposal says the \u201crapidly changing technology environment demands user-centered approaches to digital services,\u201d which are \u201cstandard in the private sector technology startups but mostly foreign to DOD.\u201d\n\nStanding up \u201ca team of this sort\u2026with a charge to disrupt will likely face some challenges,\u201d the papers warn. \u201cExisting departments and agencies may resist change.\u201d And while autonomy \u201cfrom bureaucratic impediments are vital to success\u201d the \u201chierarchical structure\u201d of a large organization like DOD \u201cis often a limiting factor in fostering experimentation and innovation.\u201d\n\nDefense Digital Services will need department leaders to give it \u201ca \u2018safe space\u2019 to experiment, test, potentially fail and iterate, as necessary.\u201d\n\nThe estimated cost of establishing the office is $175 million over five years. Measured against an annual DOD information technology budget of $35 billion, this \u201cshould be viewed as an investment in a technology startup that will have a positive return.\u201d In its first year, the office could return five to 10 times its startup costs as savings on digital services, proponents argue.\n\nSuccess would be achieved in year one if the team can build a \u201cdigital innovation brand\u201d and recruitment strategy for DOD, improve its high-tech hiring process and have in place a team of 50 to 100 digital innovators.\n\nThis and five other Force-of-the-Future ideas would impact both military and civilian personnel. Another 12 target military personnel policies only, and have been described in our last three Military Update columns. Eleven proposals still to be described would modernize the civilian workforce.\n\nPersonnel chiefs of the services \u201cnon-concurred\u201d with most of the package, citing the impact on personnel costs as budget sequestration is squeezing out more critical defense priorities and forcing deep staff cuts.\n\n\u201cThe services are viewing this [exercise] as the \u2018political good idea factory\u2019,\u201d said a senior Defense official. For example, a proposal to extend to every new parent employed by the department, military or civilian, 18 weeks of paternity leave, is viewed as commendable. It is also seen, by some military branches, as unaffordable given current budget constraints.\n\n\u201cThe services are saying [to Carson] not to ignore the cost impacts when you are talking about these good ideas,\u201d this official said.\n\nTo comment, write Military Update, P.O.
