I've never felt such a rush of adrenaline in my life,\u201d Frisby said. \"I love seeing that I'm going to eat what I shot, and what I butchered.\u201d\n\nHe and his father, Jimmy, already processed Carson\u2019s deer at home on their own. Jimmy shot his first deer of the season Sunday (Nov. 9) morning, but he\u2019ll always remember Saturday, Nov. 1.\n\n\"It was one of the best days of my life because, we'd spend a lot of time out in the woods just learning and tracking and figuring out how to pick out a place for a deer,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we set up our stand and when it came up, it was about 35 steps [away] and he had a perfect shot.\"\n\nRandy Cockrum and his wife Anjie have owned a meat processing plant for more than 30 years, and they've already seen nearly 300 deer this weekend.\n\n\"We get deer all the way up to the end of February, but nothing like this,\u201d Randy said. \u201cIt'll be hard for us to take off Thanksgiving Day, but after that, we get a handle on it.\u201d\n\nThe Cockrums have thousands of pounds of processed meat in their freezer ready for pick-up. The youth hunt alone had them processing nearly 18,000 pounds of deer meat.\n\n\"People think the woods is just woods but there's a lot of meat comes out of them,\u201d Randy said. \u201cYou can really reduce the grocery bill by putting a couple deer in the freezer.\u201d\n\nCarson said he plans to use his deer to make jerky, sausage and tenderloins.\n\n\"We're going to have everything we need for a good winter,\u201d Jimmy said.\n\nThe Cockrums said the meat can last for about two or three years in the freezer.\n\nSeveral thousand pounds of game meat from hunters are donated to local food banks and churches each year, according to Randy.\n\n\u201cIf you can get your kids out there to hunt, it gets them off the video games and out in the woods,\u201d Jimmy said. \u201cIt\u2019ll teach them something they\u2019ll value the rest of their life.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "RUDY (KFSM) \u2013 Hundreds of hunters are already killing their first deer of the modern gun season. 10-year-old Carson Frisby shot his first deer during a special youth hunt for children ages 6 to 15. \u201cIt feels great.
