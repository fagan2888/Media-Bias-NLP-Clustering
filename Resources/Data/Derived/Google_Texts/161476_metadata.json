Scientists still aren\u2019t quite sure how it starts and there is no cure for it. But the processes that cause it to worsen, which include the formation of plaques and inflammation, may be possible to reverse, according to a new study. Researchers from Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles have found that a protein associated with high blood pressure may be able to induce an immune response against Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nSomewhere along the line of Alzheimer\u2019s development, peptide amino acids called amyloid-beta begin to form plaques in the brain. These plaques build up in the space between nerve cells and inside blood vessels, blocking communication, and depleting a person\u2019s memory. The condition worsens when the immune system tries to fight off the plaques, and ends up causing inflammation. For the new study, researchers show how an enzyme, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), which normally causes blood vessels to tighten, may also break down amyloid plaques, subsequently preventing inflammation among other Alzheimer\u2019s-related problems.\n\nTo test the effects of ACE on the amyloid plaque-ridden brain, the researchers genetically engineered some lab mice to produce extra ACE in some immune cells, like macrophages and microglia. Meanwhile, other mice were engineered to have amyloid plaques and Alzheimer\u2019s symptoms. The offspring of these mice, when tested, performed similarly to normal mice in learning performance and memory tests, according to the surprised scientists.\n\n\u201cWe were absolutely astonished by the lack of Alzheimer\u2019s related pathology in the crossed mice \u2026 At first we thought we had a genotyping error in identifying these mice as carriers of the aggressive familial Alzheimer\u2019s mutations. But we verified their genotypes and ran the experiments again and again, and confirmed the same findings,\u201d said Dr. Maya Koronyo-Hamaoui, assistant professor of neurosurgery in the Department of Neurosurgery and Department of Medical Sciences, in a statement. Having an abundance of ACE in these key immune cells led to a \u201cnear-complete prevention\u201d of cognitive decline, which the researchers proved was caused by ACE when they administered ACE inhibitors \u2014 drugs used for people with high blood pressure \u2014 on the mice.\n\nAlthough the researchers weren\u2019t quite sure about the exact mechanism by which ACE cleared amyloid plaques from blood vessels, \u201cthe enzyme has been found to break down longer amyloid peptides into shorter fragments that can more readily be \u2018washed away\u2019 or cleared from the system,\u201d Koronyo-Hamaoui told Medical Daily in an email. Still, the researchers don\u2019t necessarily plan on increasing ACE levels in humans. Instead, the most informative finding from the study \u201cis the effectiveness of combining an approach to enhance the immune response with that of delivering inflammatory cells to enzymatically destroy beta-amyloid,\u201d they wrote.\n\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease affects an estimated 5.1 million Americans. It usually begins to set in sometime around 60 years old, and slowly eats away at a person\u2019s ability to recall, think, and carry out even the simplest tasks. Amyloid plaques are only one characteristic of the disease \u2014 other features include neurofibrillary tangles made of the protein, tau, and a loss of connections between nerve cells. Understanding the interplay between each one of these features and how they contribute to Alzheimer\u2019s is what makes the affliction so complex.\n\nSource: Bernstein K, Koronyo Y, Salumbides B, et al.
