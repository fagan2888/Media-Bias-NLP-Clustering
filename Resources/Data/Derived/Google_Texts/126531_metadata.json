The danger is, he says, that \u201cour country is being taken away from us right under our very noses.\u201d\n\nHe believes that a historic debate is being played out about whether Americans are citizens or subjects of their government.\n\nConservatives are on defense too much to succeed, he thinks, but also believes that help is on the way as citizens are waking up to the problems caused by both political parties.\n\n\u201cWe have to make the left start defending socialism instead of us defending liberty,\u201d Daughtry said.\n\nMainstream America started waking up when Republicans and Democrats in Washington embracing bailouts, which he says \u201cfundamentally struck Americans as wrong.\u201d\n\nThen, the widespread unpopularity of Obamacare became surprisingly irrelevant to a government that \u201crammed it through anyway.\u201d\n\nEducational textbooks depicting American history through a distorted lens of progressive ideology that glorifies redistribution is another \u201cred flag\u201d waking up parents, Daughtry believes.\n\nLosing cultural institutions to the left, like the media, education and entertainment, is far more significant, says Daughtry, than the harm done by the U.S. government. Daughtry also discusses how to respond to being called an extremist or a racist in this two-part interview.\n\nHe thinks conservatives should not accept the left\u2019s premises, since the left has done incalculable damage to the black community with their policies and programs. Now more than ever, conservative solutions need to be introduced to the marketplace of ideas that many activists are now joining.\n\nWatch Part 2:\n\nMrs. Thomas does not necessarily support or endorse the products, services or positions promoted in any advertisement contained herein, and does not have control over or receive compensation from any advertiser.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Ginni Thomas", "description": "Psychologist teaches mainstream Americans how to beat liberals at their own game", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "For Dr. Timothy Daughtry, a clinical psychologist who has co-authored a book for mainstream Americans, too many citizens think they have done their civic duty if they show up to vote and return to the", "title": "Psychologist teaches mainstream Americans how to beat liberals at their own game [VIDEO]", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/01/12/psychologist-teaches-mainstream-americans-how-to-beat-liberals-at-their-own-game-video/", "image": {"width": 422, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/timothy-daughtry-e1389559470918.jpg", "height": 181}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Psychologist teaches mainstream Americans how to beat liberals at their own game [VIDEO]", "title": "Psychologist teaches mainstream Americans how to beat liberals at their own game [VIDEO] Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/01/12/psychologist-teaches-mainstream-americans-how-to-beat-liberals-at-their-own-game-video/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/timothy-daughtry-e1389559470918.jpg"}, "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-01-12 21:27:28", "sailthru.title": "Psychologist teaches mainstream Americans how to beat liberals at their own game [VIDEO]", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "sailthru.tags": "ginni-thomas", "sailthru.description": "For Dr. Timothy Daughtry, a clinical psychologist who has co-authored a book for mainstream Americans, too many citizens think they have done their civic duty if they show up to vote and return to the", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/timothy-daughtry-e1389559470918.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4922\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe have to make the left start defending socialism instead of us defending liberty,\u201d Daughtry said.\nNow more than ever, conservative solutions need to be introduced to the marketplace of ideas that many activists are now joining.\nDaughtry also discusses how to respond to being called an extremist or a racist in this two-part interview.\nHe thinks conservatives should not accept the left\u2019s premises, since the left has done incalculable damage to the black community with their policies and programs.\nLosing cultural institutions to the left, like the media, education and entertainment, is far more significant, says Daughtry, than the harm done by the U.S. government."}
