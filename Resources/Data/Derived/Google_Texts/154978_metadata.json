He noted that in one case, a Tennessee child called 911 84 times in a single night, crippling emergency responders\u2019 ability to deal with actual crises.\n\n\u201cWhether inadvertent or intentional, the Commission needs to review its existing rules to ensure that they do not enable unwanted 911 calls to emergency personnel,\" he wrote.\n\nThe FCC began a process to update its existing rules last year but has yet to make much progress.\n\nIn his blog post, O\u2019Rielly also called for action to prevent people from using their cellphones while driving, a habit estimated to have led to more than 810,000 accidents so far this year.\n\nO\u2019Rielly, one of the FCC\u2019s two Republicans, said that the three problems he pinpointed could be stopped through educational means, not new laws or regulations.\n\n\u201cI plan to continue my efforts to spread the word that these practices can\u2019t be tolerated, as well as engage on whether the Commission can take positive steps in a non-regulatory manner to reduce their likelihood,\u201d he wrote.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Mike O'Rielly said something needs to be done.", "description": "Mike O'Rielly said something needs to be done.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Julian Hattem", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Mike O'Rielly said something needs to be done.", "title": "FCC commissioner says half of 911 calls are pocket dials", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/220797-millions-may-be-pocket-dialing-911-fcc-commissioner-warns", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-10-15T11:21:08-04:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2014-10-15T11:21-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/220797-millions-may-be-pocket-dialing-911-fcc-commissioner-warns", "dcterms.date": "2014-10-15T09:19-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Julian Hattem", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Pocket dialing, 911, Communication,Mike O'Rielly,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-15T09:19:37-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-15T11:21:08-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/220797-millions-may-be-pocket-dialing-911-fcc-commissioner-warns", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Mike O'Rielly said something needs to be done.", "card": "summary", "title": "FCC commissioner says half of 911 calls are pocket dials"}, "dcterms.title": "FCC commissioner says half of 911 calls are pocket dials"}, "article_summary": "The Federal Communications Commission needs to do something about accidental 911 calls, according to Commissioner Mike O\u2019Rielly.\nO\u2019Rielly said his own experiences have shown that at least half of all 911 calls are made by accident due to \u201cpocket dialing,\u201d adding up to a huge drain on public resources.\n\u201cWhether inadvertent or intentional, the Commission needs to review its existing rules to ensure that they do not enable unwanted 911 calls to emergency personnel,\" he wrote.\nHe noted that in one case, a Tennessee child called 911 84 times in a single night, crippling emergency responders\u2019 ability to deal with actual crises.\nThe FCC began a process to update its existing rules last year but has yet to make much progress."}
