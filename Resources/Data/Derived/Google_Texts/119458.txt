Christmas is over, but two gas stations are offering customers a gift of their own, lower gas prices. Customers were surprised to find gas for less than $2 a gallon at two MP Gas Stations.

Traveling back to Panama City after spending the Christmas holiday with her boyfriend's family in Fort Lauderdale, Kelly Navas says getting gas was costly.

"Gas was like $2.36---something like that here. When we got down there, it was like $2.70. Maybe a hundred dollars for the trip," explained Navas.

But when she made it back to Lynn Haven, Navas found possibly the cheapest gas around.

"I thought there was an error on the sign that someone just forgot to, like, make it a two instead of a one," said Navas.

But it was not an error. The two MP Food Marts are selling regular unleaded gas for a $1.99 a gallon. Management says it's a way to give back.

"I told my boyfriend that it was gonna be cheaper than two dollars---he said it will never happen. Aha! It happened," said Norma, who just finished shopping.

Right now, the average price for a gallon of regular unleaded gas in the state is $2.47. According to AAA, if gas prices stay around $2 , the average household could save more than $500 next year.

"You can take that money that you saving on gas now and pay on one of your bills or something at your house, or buy you some groceries," said Walter Wood.

It may also help the economy.

"I think that could really stimulate the economy a lot more. I think it makes people willing to go out and do stuff because sometimes it's such a pain, like, I just drive back and forth to work because it takes a lot of gas," said Navas.

But the $1.99 offer won't be here to stay. Management says

they're not sure how long prices will remain this low, but it'll stay while supplies last.

Navas said it took about $19 to fill up her SUV, which she says she hasn't seen since college.
