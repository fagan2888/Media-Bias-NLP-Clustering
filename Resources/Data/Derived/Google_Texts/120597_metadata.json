He\u2019s the father of supply side economics and author of the Laffer Curve, which measures the diminishing returns of higher tax rates.\n\nLaffer\u2019s a big deal, and children\u2019s books aren\u2019t his normal fare. But Balconi heard him speak at the Detroit Economic Club in 2012 and sent him a proposal. Laffer, who lives in Nashville, loved it.\n\n\u201cI thought it was a cool idea to touch kids in this way,\u201d Laffer says. \u201cIt\u2019s the basics \u2014 understanding incentives, trade-offs and other basic principles that come right from Michelle\u2019s own family.\u201d\n\nBalconi\u2019s two kids are in their early teens, and she says once she started talking to them about the economic principles she discussed with Laffer, the book wrote itself.\n\n\u201cThe stories in the book are about trips to the grocery store, vacations, yard sales \u2014 all opportunities to teach children economic lessons,\u201d Balconi says.\n\nBalconi could have added a chapter on chutzpah. She\u2019d never written a book before, and knew little about economics when she embarked on the project.\n\nIt took her nearly two months after the economic club event to work up the nerve to contact Laffer, whom she never even spoke to at the lunch. She had little faith that he\u2019d sign on, but felt she had to try.\n\n\u201cI screamed out loud when I got his response,\u201d she says.\n\nLaffer was impressed with Balconi\u2019s enthusiasm.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s really a high energy, wonderful person,\u201d he says. \u201cI think this book will do great.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s Chat About Economics\u201d is 35 pages, colorfully illustrated, and is aimed at elementary school children. It\u2019s available in hard- and soft-cover editions at Amazon.com, in a Kindle version, and locally at Book Beat in Oak Park and Book Connection in Shelby Township.\n\nI\u2019m outside the target audience, but I read it and, and found economics presented at a grade school level to be just about the right speed.\n\nHad it been written earlier, it may have derailed Obamacare.\n\nnfinley@detroitnews.com\n\n(313)222-2064\n\nFollow Nolan Finley at detroitnews.com/finley, on Twitter at nolanfinleydn, on Facebook at nolanfinleydetnews and watch him at 7:30 p.m. Thursdays on \u201cMiWeek\u201d on Detroit Public TV, Channel 56.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://detne.ws/1CHl0kQ", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Michelle Balconi\u2019s \u201cLet\u2019s Chat About Economics!\u201d is a great teaching tool for young people", "og": {"site_name": "Detroit News", "description": "Michelle Balconi\u2019s \u201cLet\u2019s Chat About Economics!\u201d is a great teaching tool for young people", "title": "Finley: Prove Gruber wrong; teach kids economics", "url": "http://www.detroitnews.com/story/opinion/columnists/nolan-finley/2014/12/04/nolan-finley-teach-economics/19856811/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/detroitnews.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Michelle Balconi\u2019s \u201cLet\u2019s Chat About Economics!\u201d is a great teaching tool for young people", "title": "Finley: Let's chat about economics", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a8705a1a319714426903bb9c10750636e05894e1/c=0-34-260-294&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/DetroitNews/2014/12/03/B99221893Z.1_20141203172134_000_GD4D91IU.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@detroitnews", "site": "@detroitnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=904391631", "fb": {"app_id": 175422022549521}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Nolan Finley, Jonathan Gruber, Obamacare, Let's Chat About Economics, Michelle Balconi, Art Laffer"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI think this book will do great.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s Chat About Economics\u201d is 35 pages, colorfully illustrated, and is aimed at elementary school children.\nGrosse Pointe\u2019s Michelle Balconi and economist Art Laffer co-authored \u201cLet\u2019s Chat About Economics!\u201d (Photo: Courtesy: Amazon)If Americans really are as economically gullible as Jonathan Gruber believes, it won\u2019t be Michelle Balconi\u2019s fault if the next generation remains that way.\nBalconi, a Grosse Pointe freelance writer and mother, just finished a children\u2019s book titled \u201cLet\u2019s Chat About Economics!\u201d If you think such a suggestion might send your kids running for the video game console, Balconi says you\u2019re the perfect target for her book.\nHe\u2019s the father of supply side economics and author of the Laffer Curve, which measures the diminishing returns of higher tax rates.\nWhat sets Balconi\u2019s book apart is her co-author \u2014 Arthur Laffer, one of the most influential economists in America and President Ronald Reagan\u2019s economic adviser."}
