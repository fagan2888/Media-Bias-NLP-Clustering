Peter Shumlin\u2019s forthcoming single-payer financing plan because it relies on economic modeling provided by Jonathan Gruber.\n\nAs Shumlin gets ready to present a health-care financing plan to the legislature in January, key lawmakers who will decide its fate are saying Gruber\u2019s explosive video confessions severely damage the proposal.\n\n\u201cHow could anyone trust this man who has said with arrogance that the lack of transparency and the stupidity of the American people is why Obamacare and related individual state health-care reform has passed?\u201d said Rep. Mary Morrissey, R-Bennington.\n\nMorrissey, a member of the House Committee on Health Care, said the issue was too important to keep Gruber on as a consultant in Vermont, even if he\u2019s no longer being paid.\n\n\u201cHow could anyone put a person like Mr. Gruber into a position of power over an initiative like health care that affects every citizen personally and financially?\u201d she asked.\n\nIn comments made at a health-care panel at the University of Pennsylvania last year, Gruber, a chief architect of the Affordable Care Act, said the federal health law was \u201cwritten in a tortured way\u201d to conceal from the public that the individual mandate was a tax. It also was written to disguise the idea the plan involved government redistribution of money from the healthy to the sick.\n\n\u201cIf you made explicit that healthy people pay in and sick people get money, it would not have passed,\u201d Gruber said of the Affordable Care Act. \u201cLack of transparency is a huge political advantage \u2026 and I would rather have this bill than not.\u201d\n\nGruber\u2019s admission that he misled others to obtain a predetermined outcome stands to discredit Shumlin\u2019s health-care financing plan, which relies on economic modeling provided by Gruber.\n\nState Sen. Jane Kitchel, D-Caledonia, vice chair of Joint Fiscal Committee, said the legislature is taking extra precautions with regard to the coming Shumlin-Gruber plan.\n\n\u201cI know there\u2019s concern about Gruber and his statements. But even without that, last session the legislature tried to put itself in a position where we could do our own due diligence in terms of the analysis,\u201d Kitchel said.\n\n\n\nRead more at Watchdog.org\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Vermont lawmakers say they\u2019re skeptical of Gov.
