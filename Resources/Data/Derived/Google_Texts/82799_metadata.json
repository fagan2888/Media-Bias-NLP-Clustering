He told NPR that he became nervous about not having insurance when he found out his wife, Rachel Robinson, was pregnant with their third child.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of those times where you hear the news and there\u2019s this immediate sense of joy and excitement like, \u2018Yay, a new kid. That\u2019s awesome!\u2019 \u201d he shared with NPR as concern settled in about the baby news. \u201cWhat are we going to do? How are we going to pay for this? This is intense.\u201d\n\nHe found a new job as an account manager in retail sourcing, but it did not have benefits. His wife also does not have benefits working as a wedding photographer. So they decided to look around at their options.\n\nThe couple applied for Medicaid but did not qualify in Texas. They thought about paying out of pocket, however, the quotes they received for a basic hospital birth, up to $15,000, scared them.\n\nNick Robinson started hearing the positive news about the Affordable Care Act and decided that the new insurance was going to be their answer.\n\n\u201cI was like, \u2018Oh, here\u2019s the answer! This is simple!\u2019 \u201d he told NPR. \u201d \u2018It\u2019s a cheaper insurance plan, there\u2019s no pre-existing condition stuff.\u2019 \u201c\n\nHis wife, however, was skeptical as he went online and started shopping around for insurance. He began to have trouble trying to get through the glitchy website, but eventually he was able to pick a plan. Nick Robinson chose a gold plan HMO through Blue Cross Blue Shield that would cost about $375 a month.\n\nWhen the plan began in January, he printed out a list of obstetricians from the plan\u2019s website for his wife.\n\n\u201cI handed it over to Rachel, fully confident, fully feeling like I had accomplished something for her, I had come through for my wife,\u201d he said to NPR. \u201cThis whole Obamacare thing was going to work!\u201d\n\nBut his wife sat down and two days later called every doctor on the list of 28 and was shocked to find that most of the practices in one way or another did not take the plan.\n\n\u201cSome would just come right out and say, \u2018We don\u2019t take Obamacare,\u2019 \u201d she told NPR. \u201cOr the best one was, \u2018The doctor takes it here at the actual practice, but whatever hospital you use \u2026 does not take that insurance.'\u201d\n\nThat wasn\u2019t the only issue. She explained that some of the doctors told her they wouldn\u2019t see her because she was too far along in her pregnancy at the time, roughly 30 weeks. The practices that did take the insurance operated as a rotating clinic meaning she wasn\u2019t guaranteed to see the same doctor every visit.\n\n\u201cIt was mind numbing,\u201d she told NPR. \u201cBecause I was just sitting there thinking, \u2018I\u2019m paying close to $400 a month just for me to have insurance that doesn\u2019t even work. So what am I paying for?\u2019 \u201c\n\nHer husband grew even more frustrated after he called Blue Cross to be told that the doctors should take the plan.\n\n\u201cHow could this not be working?\u201d he explained to NPR. \u201cThe United States government has set this up. It\u2019s this whole big deal; there are commercials everywhere saying we need to use this. And they\u2019re just saying, \u2018No, no, no,\u2019 and that just made me so mad!\u201d\n\nLouis Adams, a spokesman for Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas, said that he checked the same list a month after Rachel Robinson had checked it and found that most of the 28 doctors do take the HMO insurance.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re committed to helping our new members understand how to get the most from their coverage, and also [are] working with doctors and hospitals to inform them of the range of coverage options we have available,\u201d Adams told NPR.\n\nThe family felt extremely lost especially with their baby being due in April and at that time it was January. Friends had suggested using a midwife, but they had rejected the idea previously.\n\n\u201cOur answers to that were, \u2018Absolutely not,\u2019 \u201d Nick Robinson said to NPR. \u201cThat\u2019s insane. We\u2019re not going to go to some crazy witch doctor lady, and make us get in a giant tub. Those are the crazy people. We\u2019re the normal people. We want to have our birth in a hospital!\u201d\n\nHis wife had two cesarean sections for their two daughters and both parents thought it was risky to have a home birth with a baby being delivered vaginally. They changed their minds, though, after Rachel Robinson met a midwife who she loved and an out of pocket home birth would only cost them $4,000.\n\nThey decided to stop paying the premium for Obamacare and completely drop the insurance plan.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re so happy with where we are now, but this is not okay. And I\u2019m extremely confident that, that\u2019s not what the architects of this plan had in mind,\u201d Nick Robinson said to NPR.\n\nHis wife gave birth at home in a huge tub with zero pain medication to a healthy baby boy they named Cash, after Johnny Cash, on April 28.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A family opted out of the Affordable Care Act, after growing frustrated with the website and miscommunication with the insurance company.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://houston.cbslocal.com/2014/05/27/family-opts-out-of-obamacare-plan-after-they-say-doctors-told-them-they-didnt-take-their-insurance/", "image": {"width": 1500, "secure_url": "https://cbshouston.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/481715489.jpg?w=1500", "identifier": "https://cbshouston.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/481715489.jpg?w=1500", "height": 1005}, "type": "article", "description": "A family opted out of the Affordable Care Act, after growing frustrated with the website and miscommunication with the insurance company.", "title": "Family Opts Out Of Obamacare Plan After They Say Doctors Told Them They Didn't Take Their Insurance"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://cbshouston.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/481715489.jpg?w=1500", "title": "Family Opts Out Of Obamacare Plan After They Say Doctors Told Them They Didn't Take Their Insurance", "site": "/sportsradio610", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "A family opted out of the Affordable Care Act, after growing frustrated with the website and miscommunication with the insurance company."}, "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Sports, Weather, Traffic and the Best Of Houston", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CBS Houston", "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "keywords": "aca information, affordable care act, news, affordable care act, blue cross blue shield of texas, insurance, nick robinson, obamacare, rachel robinson", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/pages/SportsRadio-610/104032468352?ref=tn_tnmn", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/pages/SportsRadio-610/104032468352?ref=tn_tnmn"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://houston.cbslocal.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/0cfb6508d7061918922ef03d191d5848?s=16", "news_keywords": "affordable care act, blue cross blue shield of texas, insurance, nick robinson, obamacare, rachel robinson"}, "article_summary": "DALLAS (CBS Houston) \u2013 A family opted out of their Obamacare plan after growing frustrated with the website and miscommunication with the insurance company.\n\u201cSome would just come right out and say, \u2018We don\u2019t take Obamacare,\u2019 \u201d she told NPR.\nThey decided to stop paying the premium for Obamacare and completely drop the insurance plan.\n\u201d \u2018It\u2019s a cheaper insurance plan, there\u2019s no pre-existing condition stuff.\u2019 \u201cHis wife, however, was skeptical as he went online and started shopping around for insurance.\nHe told NPR that he became nervous about not having insurance when he found out his wife, Rachel Robinson, was pregnant with their third child."}
