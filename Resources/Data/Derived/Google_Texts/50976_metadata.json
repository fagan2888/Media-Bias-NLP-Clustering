Yet the vast majority in this country is not happy with the transformation and the growth of government into every aspect of our lives.\n\nLast month, the Supreme Court made same sex marriage the law of the land, and put the very existence of religious liberty guaranteed in the First Amendment, directly in the crosshairs of radical ideologues on the left.\n\nBut the Supreme Court wasn\u2019t finished. In addition to the narrow, 5-4 decision that redefined marriage and deprived We the People of the right to work this out among ourselves, they also rescued Obamacare (again), by rewriting the clear language of the statute to mean something it clearly didn\u2019t mean.\n\nThis flurry of court activity was enough to cause many Americans to sit back and wonder what had happened to the country they knew and loved. Pundits lamented the breakdown of cultural mores and standards. Preachers spoke from the pulpit about maintaining Biblical standards after the cultural tide has turned. And the majority of us just wanted to know when the government would leave us alone to live our lives in peace.\n\nToday, 62% of Americans say they believe there is too much government power and too little individual freedom in the United States today. Just 10% disagree. Finally, something most of us agree upon. That is, most of us except the government.\n\nSo is there anything we can do about the changes that seem to be beyond our control. Is there really a solution? Or is it all just so big and far away that there\u2019s nothing that can be done?\n\nFor example, is there anything at all we can do about the Supreme Court\u2019s disregard for the Constitution?\n\nJustice Alito encapsulated it perfectly: \u201cToday\u2019s decision shows that decades of attempts to restrain this Court\u2019s abuse of its authority have failed.\u201d Even though Article I, Section 1 of the Constitution gives legislative power only to the Congress of the United States, the five justices completely ignored the popular vote of millions of Americans in one fell swoop.\n\nThis is an attack on self-governance and our republican form of government itself. And the Supreme Court is just the final straw. Presidents have long abused Executive Order power to legislate from the White House. Congress has abdicated its authority to unelected and unaccountable bureaucrats and refuses to use the power of the purse to provide appropriate checks and balances. In short, our structural system of governance has broken down.\n\nSo what to do? Constitutional scholar Michael Farris has some ideas, which he outlined in the Daily Caller:\n\n1. \u201cTerm limits could be imposed on the justices.\u201d\n\n2. \u201cWe could add \u2018deliberate failure to follow the original meaning of the Constitution\u2019 as grounds for impeachment.\u201d\n\n3. \u201cWe could give the power of impeachment to state legislatures.\u201d\n\n4. \u201cEvery state should be allowed to appoint a member of the Supreme Court. They could serve for a brief term, perhaps eight years.\u201d\n\nBut all of these proposed solutions require a Constitutional Amendment. That, of course, means none will happen if we leave it up to the government. The federal government does many things: it grows, expands, becomes more corrupt, and consumes more of our resources. But one thing it never does? It does not voluntarily restrict itself.\n\nThankfully, the Constitution has a built in \u201cemergency cord\u201d that gives citizens the final word, by calling for a Convention of States through Article V. The Founders, in their wisdom about human nature, knew that the federal government would one day grow so large that it would abuse its power. That\u2019s why they gave the states the Constitutional ability to restrain the federal government, even against the federal government\u2019s will. Already, four states have passed applications to call a convention to impose binding restraints on a federal government drunk on its own supremacy. In other words, there is a way to challenge the Supreme Court, and the movement is already underway.\n\nWe\u2019ve had several weeks to appreciate how bad things have gotten. Now, let\u2019s quit lamenting the fall of civilization and get to work. We are lucky to live in times such as this where the choice is clear. We have the opportunity and the privilege to achieve great and historic things. And thanks to the wisdom of the men who drafted the Constitution, we have the power under Article V to bypass the President, the Congress and the Supreme Court, and set things right.\n\nIn short, we\u2019re talking about getting the government out of our lives, and putting the citizens back in charge. And we do have the power to do that using Article V to call a Convention of States. We the People, in charge. Now that\u2019s \u201cfundamental transformation\u201d of the best kind.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 1742097289343962}, "generator": "WordPress 4.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1e81\"", "article_summary": "In other words, there is a way to challenge the Supreme Court, and the movement is already underway.\n\u201cEvery state should be allowed to appoint a member of the Supreme Court.\nBut the Supreme Court wasn\u2019t finished.\nAnd we do have the power to do that using Article V to call a Convention of States.\nAnd the Supreme Court is just the final straw."}
