Once more, Britain and America stand together. Once more, we need strong and determined leadership to meet the challenges of our time.\u201d\n\nDevelopments in the works, they said, include a new trade deal between the European Union and the United States.\n\n\u201cWe also have to make sure prosperity is shared broadly,\u201d they wrote. \u201cFor economic growth to be sustainable and meaningful, it must reach everyone, not just a few at the top.\n\n\u201cSo we are working to help families to stake their claim to a better future and buy their first home,\u201d they wrote. \u201cWe are supporting small businesses, expanding apprenticeships, improving education for all, and backing increases in the minimum wage. And we are co-operating to promote clean energy, reduce our carbon emissions and build our resilience to the impacts of climate change.\u201d\n\nThey also pledged to continue to stand together against \u201cthose who threaten our values and our way of life,\u201d saying that \u201cwe will not be cowed by extremists.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are more than one billion Muslims in the world, the vast majority of whom are sickened by the evil these terrorists claim to perpetrate in the name of Islam,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThe United States and Britain will continue to work closely with all those who believe in peace and tolerance. The terrorists know only how to destroy, but together we can do something infinitely more powerful: build security, strengthen justice and advance peace.\u201d\n\nThe leaders also pledged to continue to stand up to Russia\u2019s \u201caggressive actions in Ukraine.\u201d\n\n\u201cSecurity and prosperity go hand in hand. By confronting the terrorists who threaten us, standing together against Russia\u2019s aggressive acts and continuing our efforts to advance our economic growth, we will continue to advance the security and prosperity that our people deserve,\u201d they wrote.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ahead of a scheduled visit by British Prime Minister David Cameron to the White House Thursday, Mr. Cameron and President Obama penned an op-ed reaffirming longstanding ties between the two countries amid recent global tumult.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Ahead of a scheduled visit by British Prime Minister David Cameron to the White House Thursday, Mr. Cameron and President Obama penned an op-ed reaffirming longstanding ties between the two countries amid recent global tumult.", "title": "Obama, David Cameron: \u2018Once more, Britain and America stand together\u2019", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/15/obama-david-cameron-once-more-britain-and-america-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/15/australia-g-20jpeg-03cfb.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/15/australia-g-20jpeg-03cfb.jpg", "description": "Ahead of a scheduled visit by British Prime Minister David Cameron to the White House Thursday, Mr. Cameron and President Obama penned an op-ed reaffirming longstanding ties between the two countries", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama, David Cameron: \u2018Once more, Britain and America stand toge"}, "Author": "David Sherfinski", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Environment, Politics"}, "article_summary": "Pressing challenges, they continued, include promoting global growth and combating global climate change.\n\u201cFor economic growth to be sustainable and meaningful, it must reach everyone, not just a few at the top.\nAhead of a scheduled visit by British Prime Minister David Cameron to the White House Thursday, Mr. Cameron and President Obama penned an op-ed reaffirming longstanding ties between the two countries amid recent global tumult.\nOnce more, Britain and America stand together.\n\u201cThe United States and Britain will continue to work closely with all those who believe in peace and tolerance."}
