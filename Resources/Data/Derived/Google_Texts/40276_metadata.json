The results of this year\u2019s survey show health care is returning to the days when care --not bureaucracy--was the top focus.\n\n\u201cOf the medical students surveyed, 72% said they would likely practice patient-centered care where the patient is the most important part of the health care team,\u201d says Dr. Anne Meneghetti, director of clinical communications for Epocrates. \u201cThe concept comes full circle.\u201d\n\nRewind just two decades, and it was common for doctors to make house calls and spend more than 10 minutes with their patients. In today\u2019s era of health care, doctors are squeezed for time as they work to see more patients to make up for the smaller reimbursements from insurers.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act will also tax the nation\u2019s health-care system as millions of previously uninsured people enter the system. The survey also shows medical students envision care in the future that includes the patient, other doctors, friends and family members playing a role in care. \u201cThere\u2019s a big recognition that multiple healthcare providers are part of the team,\u201d says Meneghetti. \u201cThey are all part of the patient\u2019s health-care journey.\u201d\n\nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn addition to making the patient part of the treatment, the physicians of tomorrow will use technology much more than current doctors. Not only has technology become more advanced, medical students are comfortable juggling a smartphone, tablet PC and computer at any given second as they grew up with the technology. For instance, Meneghetti envisions a scenario where a physician may be able to swivel a tablet screen to show a patient his X-ray, medical test results or a treatment plan instead of just describing what is going on.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, according to the survey, 44% of the students indicated they are using smartphones, tablets and PCs, and 82% say they would recommend a health related app to their patients.\n\nTechnology will also play more of a role outside the doctor\u2019s office in the future. Since a lot of patients\u2019 health depends on the decisions they make every day, like diligently taking medicine or eating well, technology can help hold patients accountable and get support.\n\n\u201cMedical students highlighted as acceptable an online support group instead of attending a traditional one,\u201d says Meneghetti.\n\nHow practitioners access clinical data and information will also change. In the past, many doctors would seek clinical information and advice from their peers, but medical students are much more comfortable relying on the Internet for answers. According to the survey, 66% said they turn to digital references for answers, while 53% will first turn to a mobile reference. Only 21% of respondents would go to a peer first to get the information they needed.\n\nEven in this era of oversharing on social networks, medical students are sensitive to privacy issues and wouldn\u2019t be too ready to share patient data on Facebook, according to the survey. In fact, 91% of students wouldn\u2019t friend a patient on Facebook, and 82% think it\u2019s unacceptable to post pictures of a patient or share medical information online.\n\nOne thing that hasn\u2019t changed is why these medical students want to become doctors. Although there are a lot of challenges under the current healthcare system, most students aren\u2019t in it for the money or fame\u2014they want to heal. But technology will be used more often in the process .\n\n\u201cThe big challenge is how to make it invisible so it doesn\u2019t get in the way of how you serve and engage the patient,\u201d says Meneghetti. \u201cTechnology has changed and they want to make the best use of it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX BUSINESS/HEALTH CARE", "dcterms.modified": "2016-01-10 05:13:23
