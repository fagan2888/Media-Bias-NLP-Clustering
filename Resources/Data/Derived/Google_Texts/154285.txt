Here’s some information on the final four wrestling matches of Saturday night for Class 5A from the Pepsi Center.

There was snow, we had early deadlines and the matches ran late …

In a word, Devin Rothrock was awesome. Arvada West’s 220-pounder pinned Tyler Zook in 1 minute, 10 seconds, to take his second consecutive state championship. In 2014, Rothrock won the title at 195.

It was typical Rothrock on Saturday — he pinned his way through the bracket, winning four matches in a combined 5:49, or 11 seconds less than the time for a regulation bout. His preliminary-round effort results in a pin in 17 seconds, of Pine Creek’s Jeremie Medina.

He’s headed to Northern Colorado.

He also couldn’t shake my hand — he said he hurt his shoulder.

At 182, Konnor Schmidt of Rocky Mountain finished 39-2 with a tight 2-1 decision of Trenton Schultz of Mountain Vista.

And Jacob Seely of Fruita Monument completed a 42-0 senior year with 16-0 technical fall of ThunderRidge’s Matthew Stanley.

At heavyweight, Dane Drimmer of Chaparral also gutted one out — he came up with a late escape to down Taylor White of Pine Creek 5-4.
