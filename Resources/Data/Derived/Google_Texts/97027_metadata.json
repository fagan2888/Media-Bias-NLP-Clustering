As the officer approached, he said he saw the driver and female passenger switch places.\n\nThe officer called for backup and knocked on the passenger door. When Broughton opened it, \u201cI could smell the overpowering odor of marijuana,\u201d the officer reported. Officers reported finding Xanax in a book bag. Broughton told police they had smoked the pot, according to the report.\n\nOfficers also said they found a loaded handgun in the center console between the seats, but no red flags came up when they ran a check on it.\n\nThe passenger who had jumped into the driver\u2019s seat was cited for allowing an unauthorized person to operate her rental car.\n\nThe next day, the arresting officer smelled pot in the patrol car but couldn\u2019t find the source. He reviewed the arrest video and observed Broughton pull a clear bag that later tested as pot from his pants and wedge it in the partition, according to the report. Broughton also was cited for possession of pot.\n\nBroughton was released from the Charleston County jail on $10,000 total bail and must also go to court for the speeding ticket.\n\nReach Dave Munday at 843-937-5553.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "North Charleston police: Man arrested five times driving with no license hides pot in cop car, FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nMetro, driving under suspension,DUS,North Charleston Police Department", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "A Ladson man who was charged with driving without a valid license for the fifth time this week hid a bag of pot inside the patrol car after he was arrested, according to North Charleston police.", "title": "North Charleston police: Man arrested five times driving with no license hides pot in cop car", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20151211/151219857/north-charleston-police-man-arrested-five-times-driving-with-no-license-hides-pot-in-cop-car", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20151211/PC16/151219857/AR/0/AR-151219857.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20151211/PC16/151219857/AR/0/AR-151219857.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A Ladson man who was charged with driving without a valid license for the fifth time this week hid a bag of pot inside the patrol car after he was arrested, according to North Charleston police.", "title": "North Charleston police: Man arrested five times driving with no license hides pot in cop car", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20151211/PC16/151219857/AR/0/AR-151219857.jpg?201512111641", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 151219857}}, "keywords": "North Charleston police: Man arrested five times driving with no license hides pot in cop car , FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nMetro, driving under suspension,DUS,North Charleston Police Department", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-11T15:00:33Z", "modified_time": "2015-12-11T16:41:00Z", "author": "Dave Munday"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "A Ladson man who was charged with driving without a valid license for the fifth time this week hid a bag of pot inside the patrol car after he was arrested, according to North Charleston police."}, "article_summary": "A Ladson man who was charged with driving without a valid license for the fifth time this week hid a bag of pot inside the patrol car after he was arrested, according to North Charleston police.\nBroughton told police they had smoked the pot, according to the report.\nWhen Broughton opened it, \u201cI could smell the overpowering odor of marijuana,\u201d the officer reported.\nThe next day, the arresting officer smelled pot in the patrol car but couldn\u2019t find the source.\nJesse Sebastian Broughton, 23, of Ladson Road was arrested Wednesday and charged with speeding, fifth-offense driving under suspension, habitual offender and possession of a controlled substance."}
