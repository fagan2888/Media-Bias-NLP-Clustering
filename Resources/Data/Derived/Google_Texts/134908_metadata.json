Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, after the chairman of the Judiciary Committee accused Democrats earlier Thursday of throwing \u201cchildish tantrums.\u201d\n\nSounding incredulous, Reid responded to the characterization by telling Grassley and Senate Republicans to \u201cdo your job. That\u2019s all we ask.\u201d\n\n\u201cA childish tantrum?\u201d Reid said of Grassley\u2019s crack. \u201cWhen we\u2019re asking him to do his job? He\u2019s chairman of the committee. He should hold committee hearings [and] report people out.\u201d\n\nThe Judiciary Committee scrutinizes presidential nominees for federal judgeships, including the Supreme Court, then votes on whether they move on to a vote on the Senate floor.\n\nSenate Republicans continue a regular drumbeat that Scalia\u2019s seat should remain open for the next president to fill after the November election. On Tuesday, the 10 other Republicans on the Judiciary Committee joined Grassley in announcing they won\u2019t hold any hearings for an eventual nominee.\n\nDemocrats counter that Republicans are abandoning their constitutional responsibility to advise and consent on a president\u2019s judicial nominees. They complain that Republicans are engaging in partisan obstructionism encouraged by \u201cthe hard right.\u201d\n\nBut Republicans found plenty of ammunition in Democrats\u2019 past rhetoric to fire back with.\n\nIn July 2007, when President George W. Bush had 18 months left in his second term, Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., urged the Democrat majority in the Senate to block Bush\u2019s appointment of any more judges.\n\nRepublicans reminded Democrats that in June 1992, Vice President Joe Biden, then a senator from Delaware, argued that the Senate shouldn\u2019t even hold a hearing if Bush\u2019s father, George H.W. Bush, nominated a Supreme Court justice in the months before the November presidential election.\n\nOn the Senate floor Monday, Grassley urged the Senate to follow what he dubbed \u201cthe Biden Rules.\u201d\n\nDemocrats bristle under those comparisons.\n\nSchumer told reporters Thursday that such arguments are \u201ccomparing apples to oranges.\u201d\n\nThe New York Democrat accused his GOP colleagues of \u201ctaking speeches out of context.\u201d He said that withholding a confirmation hearing has \u201cnever been done\u201d and that \u201cRepublicans are the first to do it.\u201d\n\nIn the Senate minority since the 2014 elections, Democrats have limited parliamentary options with which to counter Republicans.\n\nThey have been trying to outflank Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., by picking off rank-and-file senators through a public pressure campaign.\n\n\u201cThe best weapon we have in this fight is the public,\u201d Schumer told reporters. \u201cAnd the public will put pressure on the senators, and the senators will pressure McConnell.\u201d He added:\n\nWe don\u2019t have a legislative tool because we\u2019re not in the majority, except for shutting down the government, but we\u2019re not going to do what they do. We have faith that the public will put pressure and they will have to yield.\n\nThe third ranking Senate Democrat could have reason for his optimism. A new Pew Research Center survey found that 56 percent of those polled say the Senate \u201cshould hold hearings and vote on President Obama\u2019s choice to fill [the] vacancy.\u201d\n\nTo keep the seat open, Republicans will have to remain unified for the nearly 11 months left in Obama\u2019s time in office.\n\nDemocrats predict that Republicans will crack, as they have in similar fights over funding Obamacare, reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank, and confirming Attorney General Loretta Lynch.\n\nObama also suggested Wednesday that McConnell eventually will fold. Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, the president said he already had talked to several Republican senators who were unenthusiastic about the ongoing battle.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of vigor when they defend the position they\u2019re taking,\u201d the president said. \u201cThey\u2019re pretty sheepish.\u201d\n\nNext week, Grassley and McConnell plan to meet with the president to discuss the nomination process.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to reiterating to him directly that the American people will be heard,\u201d the two said in a joint statement, \u201cand the next Supreme Court justice will be determined once the elections are complete and the next president has been sworn into office.\u201d\n\nSo far Democrats have promised they won\u2019t let the Supreme Court fight stall one of Senate Republicans\u2019 biggest priorities: funding the government through the regular appropriations process.\n\nThey insist that the current debate is not opportunistic and that their argument would remain consistent if they reversed roles with the Republican majority.\n\n\u201cThis is not a partisan issue in any way, shape, or form,\u201d Reid said at the press conference.\n\nIn the current battle, Reid\u2019s presumed successor as the Senate\u2019s top Democrat says he\u2019s a happy warrior. \u201cI always have fun. I like this job. I like the politics. I\u2019m from Brooklyn,\u201d Schumer told The Daily Signal.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201cThe best weapon we have in this fight is the public,\" Sen.
