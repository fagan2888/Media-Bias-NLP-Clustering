Police are advising motorists to use alternate routes.

Westbound traffic is being diverted to Longpoint Road.

Mount Pleasant police officials had earlier reported that eastbound traffic was closed. Police sent an email correction stating eastbound traffic was open and westbound traffic is closed.

The potential jumper has been talked down from the bridge. The Wando Bridge is now open after Mt. Pleasant Police Department has cleared the bridge.
