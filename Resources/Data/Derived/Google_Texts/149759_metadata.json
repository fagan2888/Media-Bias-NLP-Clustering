It\u2019s not worth spending the money on it when they don\u2019t help you get what you need and when they don\u2019t listen to you and don\u2019t support you.\u201d\n\nMinnesota went from 414,000 union members in 2003 to 362,000 in 2013, a decline from 17 percent to 14.3 percent of the state\u2019s workforce. Nationally, 11.2 percent of workers belonged to a union in 2013, according to the most recent figures.\n\nSome 185,000 Minnesotans or 8.4 percent of the private-sector workforce, belong to unions. Nearly as many, 177,000 Minnesotans or 53.1 percent, of public-sector employees affiliate with unions.\n\n\u201cOverall, I think their position is much, much weaker than it used to be and employees are not adverse to crossing picket lines in the way they used to be,\u201d said Doug Seaton, a Twin Cities attorney who represents employers in labor disputes.\n\nThere are many more people operating non-union, even in industries like construction, where they have been traditionally strong. And in manufacturing, it\u2019s almost every instance when a firm changes hands, there\u2019s at least a serious issue about whether the union will survive those transactions.\n\nUnion representatives didn\u2019t respond to inquiries for this story. But the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Council 5 website ticks off a list of accomplishments over the past decade, from winning contract battles to fighting government shutdowns to expanding collective bargaining rights.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve chosen to grow in the face of a raging anti-union storm,\u201d states AFSCME executive director Elliot Seide with other union leaders on the website. \u201cWe\u2019ve focused on goals that benefit all working people, whether they are union members or not.\u201d\n\nRead more at Watchdog.org.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Despite a \u201cWeek of Action\u201d pickets in December, federal government labor statistics reveal a decade of decline for union membership here and nationwide.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Despite a \u201cWeek of Action\u201d pickets in December, federal government labor statistics reveal a decade of decline for union membership here and nationwide.", "title": "Even in Liberal Minnesota, Labor Unions Are Losing Members", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150104_LaborUnions.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-01-04T00:37:51+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1tHrMDQ"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Despite a \u201cWeek of Action\u201d pickets in December, federal government labor statistics reveal a decade of decline for union membership here and nationwide.", "title": "Even in Liberal Minnesota, Labor Unions Are Losing Members", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150104_LaborUnions.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "labor", "published_time": "2015-01-04T03:01:32+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-04T00:37:51+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Week of Action, labor unions, union members"}, "article_summary": "Despite a \u201cWeek of Action\u201d pickets last month, federal government labor statistics reveal a decade of decline for union membership in Minnesota and nationwide.\nProminent media coverage of recent protests by workers targeting Twin Cities fast food outlets, Walmart and Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport gave the impression of unions on the rise in Minnesota.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve focused on goals that benefit all working people, whether they are union members or not.\u201dRead more at Watchdog.org.\nNearly as many, 177,000 Minnesotans or 53.1 percent, of public-sector employees affiliate with unions.\nSome 185,000 Minnesotans or 8.4 percent of the private-sector workforce, belong to unions."}
