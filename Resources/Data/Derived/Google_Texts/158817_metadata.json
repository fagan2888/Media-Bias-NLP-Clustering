Medicaid is a federally-mandated program that provides health care to low-income children, elderly and disabled people.\n\nNorth Carolina lawmakers have opted not to expand Medicaid, which would offer health insurance to additional low-income adults not eligible for health insurance subsidies on the open market.\n\nThe State Auditor\u2019s office, headed by Democrat Beth Wood, contracted with an outside medical research $279,457 to conduct the audit. Major findings included the $309 annual savings per patient (based on 2003 to 2012 data), as well as what were seen as improved health outcomes, a 20 percent increase in physician\u2019s services (which is believed to prevent more expensive future care) and a 25 percent drop in inpatient admissions. The researcher saw no statistical difference in emergency room visits.\n\nClick here to read the entire audit.\n\nCCNC works by pairing Medicaid patients with a primary care doctor or office, which for an additional fee then helps manage individual patient\u2019s care with the intention of cutting down on unneeded medical expenses and providing better care.\n\nCCNC\u2019s future in the state is murky, with the Republican-led House and Senate chambers currently trying to decide how the $14 billion Medicaid program should be managed, and whether it should be privatized. House members have been more open to keeping CCNC, while the Senate has proposed doing away with the state\u2019s contract with CCNC and instead turning to managed-care health companies to take over the bulk of the state\u2019s Medicaid cases.\n\nThere\u2019s also been considerable turnover in CCNC itself. Several top leaders left the non-profit entity recently, for what CCNC described as a \u201cdownsizing.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf552\"", "article_summary": "Community Care of North Carolina saves the state\u2019s Medicaid program money, by about $309 per patient, according to an audit released today by the State Auditor\u2019 s Office.\nMedicaid is a federally-mandated program that provides health care to low-income children, elderly and disabled people.\nCCNC works by pairing Medicaid patients with a primary care doctor or office, which for an additional fee then helps manage individual patient\u2019s care with the intention of cutting down on unneeded medical expenses and providing better care.\nThe State Auditor\u2019s office, headed by Democrat Beth Wood, contracted with an outside medical research $279,457 to conduct the audit.\nCCNC\u2019s future in the state is murky, with the Republican-led House and Senate chambers currently trying to decide how the $14 billion Medicaid program should be managed, and whether it should be privatized."}
