I would knock out Obamacare. Take care of our vets and military,\u201d said Trump.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nTrump proclaimed that the Affordable Care Act would be \u201cdead by 2017.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe people are not signing up for it. It\u2019s a disaster,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump also repeated the promise he made since he started his campaign that he would do more for veterans.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\n\u201cOur veterans have been absolutely treated horribly and we\u2019re going to take care of our vets,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump\u2019s Tuesday night victory in Nevada, and the margin of that win, have increased his stature as the likely GOP candidate.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump is now the presumptive Republican nominee,\u201d wrote Niall Stanage of The Hill. \u201cYes, there is a long way to go. But if a more conventional candidate than Trump had won three of the first four contests by such emphatic margins, there would be broad consensus that they were on their way to becoming the party\u2019s standard-bearer.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is only a week to go before Super Tuesday, when Republicans in 11 states vote. It is difficult to imagine what could happen at this stage to blunt Trump\u2019s momentum,\u201d he added.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\n\u201cIf somebody drops out, I\u2019m going to get a lot of votes,\u201d Trump said on Fox and Friends. \u201cAs an example, if Ted Cruz dropped out, I\u2019d get a lot of those votes. If any one of \u2018em drop out, I would get a lot of those votes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI watch these pundits \u2014 I\u2019ve been watching them for a year \u2014 but I\u2019ve been watching these pundits \u2026 they just add up numbers,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey forget that when somebody drops out I get a lot of those votes .\u201d\n\nTrump said the experts have been saying for months that he has hit his peak.\n\n\u201cI started at 12 [percent] and I reached my ceiling. I went to 16 [percent], they said, \u2018That is a ceiling \u2014 that\u2019s the most he\u2019s going to get,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cAnd then the national polls are even higher. You know, the national polls I\u2019m at 44 [percent]. And that\u2019s with five people. I mean, that\u2019s a lot of people.\u201d\n\nh/t: CNN", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"We're going to take care of ...\"", "author": "Jack Davis", "og": {"site_name": "Western Journalism", "description": "\"We're going to take care of ...\"", "title": "WATCH: Trump Just Revealed The 3 Things He Would Do On His First Day As President - Many Will LOVE It", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 914, "identifier": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/shutterstock_353100986-e1455988639600.jpg", "height": 610}, "updated_time": "2016-02-25T09:07:22-07:00", "url": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/watch-trump-just-revealed-the-3-things-he-would-do-on-his-first-day-as-president-many-will-love-it/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"We're going to take care of ...\"", "creator": "@WestJournalism", "image": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/shutterstock_353100986-e1455988639600.jpg", "title": "WATCH: Trump Just Revealed The 3 Things He Would Do On His First Day As President - Many Will LOVE It", "site": "@WestJournalism", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2016-02-24T12:38:07-07:00", "fb": {"app_id": 275784739127435, "pages": 123624513983}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/android-chrome-192x192.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WesternJournalism", "section": "Election 2016", "tag": "George Stephanopoulos", "published_time": "2016-02-24T12:38:07-07:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-25T09:07:22-07:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "donald trump, first day as president, three things do first, 2016 election, george stephanopoulos, politics, nation, religion"}, "article_summary": "Advertisement \u2013 story continues below\u201cIf somebody drops out, I\u2019m going to get a lot of votes,\u201d Trump said on Fox and Friends.\n\u201cThey forget that when somebody drops out I get a lot of those votes .\u201dTrump said the experts have been saying for months that he has hit his peak.\n\u201cFirst thing is knock out some of the executive orders done by our president,\u201d Trump told George Stephanopoulos Wednesday on ABC\u2019s Good Morning America.\nTrump also repeated the promise he made since he started his campaign that he would do more for veterans.\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\u201cOur veterans have been absolutely treated horribly and we\u2019re going to take care of our vets,\u201d he said."}
