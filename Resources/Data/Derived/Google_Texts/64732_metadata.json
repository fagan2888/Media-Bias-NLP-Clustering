But a decision on the Hallmark deal still could be months away.\n\n\u201cPartners and Hallmark have agreed that it\u2019s time to take a pause and reflect on next steps,\u201d Partners spokesman Rich Copp said. \u201cWe will continue our conversation about how best to work together in the future.\u201d\n\nThe uncertainty over the Partners deal is one of several challenges that Macdonald, 70, faces in his new role. Hallmark, which operates Lawrence Memorial Hospital in Medford and Melrose-Wakefield Hospital in Melrose, lost nearly $6 million on operations last year, twice as much as it lost in 2013. Macdonald became Hallmark\u2019s executive vice president for strategy and external affairs in 2012 and was promoted to interim chief executive last month.\n\nHis career includes 23 years as executive director of the Massachusetts Business Roundtable, a stint as assistant state attorney general, and jobs at Gulf Oil and General Electric.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe has served on Hallmark\u2019s board since the health system was founded in 1997. The system includes 315 hospital beds, nearly 2,800 employees, medical offices, hospice services, and home care.\n\nLike other hospital operators, Hallmark has had trouble filling beds as more patients seek care in outpatient settings. Macdonald said that to draw patients, Hallmark must recruit more physicians and build up outpatient clinics.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about running a hospital,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s really about being in the health care service business.\u201d\n\nHallmark board chairman James Herrington said the board decided to give Macdonald the chief executive\u2019s job without conducting an extensive search.\n\n\u201cHe is a strategic planner focused on strengthening our organization,\u201d Herrington said in a note to employees, \u201cand knows decisively what our organization needs to achieve on our own and as part of a larger organization for our future success.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "4.0.2126898024", "eomportal-id": 202080, "description": "Hallmark Health System, which operates two hospitals north of Boston, on Thursday appointed a new chief executive, who said he remains committed to completing  the controversial merger with Partners HealthCare of Boston.", "eomportal-instanceid": 15, "og": {"city": "Boston", "site_name": "BostonGlobe.com", "description": "Hallmark Health System, which operates two hospitals north of Boston, on Thursday appointed a new chief executive, who said he remains committed to completing  the controversial merger with Partners HealthCare of Boston.", "title": "Hallmark Health\u2019s CEO says Partners merger critical to future of its hospitals - The Boston Globe", "url": "https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2015/03/19/hallmark-health-ceo-says-partners-merger-critical-future-its-hospitals/PJ3uBq2KtkbNakpCcH27lM/story.html", "country": "US", "image": "http://c.o0bg.com/rf/image_585w/Boston/2011-2020/2015/03/20/BostonGlobe.com/Business/Images/AlanMacDonaldheadshotA[1].jpg", "longitude": "-71.05888010000001", "state": "MA", "latitude": "42.3600825", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 95431448, "card": "summary", "site": "BostonGlobe"}, "robots": "noarchive", "news_keywords": "alan macdonald,hallmark health,partners healthcare,merger,community hospitals,Business Roundtable, Gulf Oil, General Electric Co, Twitter,General Electric Co|GE|NYSE", "eomportal-lastUpdate": "Thu May 26 06:18:16 EDT 2016", "fb": {"admins": 507486035, "app_id": 103933749691726, "pages": 5637143257}, "keywords": "alan macdonald,hallmark health,partners healthcare,merger,community hospitals,Business Roundtable, Gulf Oil, General Electric Co, Twitter,General Electric Co|GE|NYSE", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/globe"}, "flashsale": "false", "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "eomportal-uuid": "7fbbb7fc-ce88-11e4-8771-8abac757e8e3"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fceb21\"", "article_summary": "Hallmark Health System Alan Macdonald is new chief executive of Hallmark Health System.\nHallmark Health System, which operates two hospitals north of Boston, on Thursday appointed a new chief executive, who said he remains committed to completing a controversial merger with Partners HealthCare.\nBut a decision on the Hallmark deal still could be months away.\n\u201cPartners and Hallmark have agreed that it\u2019s time to take a pause and reflect on next steps,\u201d Partners spokesman Rich Copp said.\n\u201cWe can maintain our position as a community hospital,\u201d Macdonald said in an interview."}
