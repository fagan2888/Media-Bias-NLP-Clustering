John Hickenlooper, who said he will ask the Colorado Supreme Court to rule against its legality. \u201cThe notion of everyone suing all the time every time you disagree with a specific remedy, a specific statute, is part of what makes people so frustrated with government,\u201d Hickenlooper said.\n\nBut if the high court rules in favor of Coffman \u2014 or possibly refuses even to accept the governor\u2019s case \u2014 it will be in part because of a precedent established by Salazar himself in a redistricting case he won in 2003. No one has more forcefully argued for the power and independence of the state\u2019s top legal officer. (For reference, see the following brief authored by Salazar\u2019s office from 2003, which is also embedded at the end of this story.)\n\nCoffman has joined two dozen other AGs from states which depend on fossil fuels to try and stop implementation of the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s plan. It requires states to cut carbon dioxide emissions by around 30 percent from 2005 levels before 2030. The states argue that, legally, the plan conflicts with the original Clean Air Act and thus will eliminate mining jobs, threaten the dependability of the electric grid and substantially drive up energy costs.\n\nThe governor\u2019s office maintains that Colorado statutes authorize the AG to prosecute or defend lawsuits involving the state only at the request of the governor.\n\nIt\u2019s not quite that simple. Former Attorney General John Suthers, who succeeded Salazar, joined a multi-state lawsuit against ObamaCare in 2010 on grounds it unconstitutionally imposed a penalty for economic inactivity (not signing up for health insurance). The suit wasn\u2019t authorized by then Gov. Bill Ritter, but he didn\u2019t try to stop it. The plaintiffs would have prevailed except for a tortured opinion written by Chief Justice John Roberts.\n\nSuthers also defended Colorado\u2019s prohibition on gay marriage without Hickenlooper\u2019s support. The he went on to appeal an adverse decision despite the governor\u2019s protests. But Hickenlooper didn\u2019t try to stop him.\n\nSalazar, however, takes the prize, having taken on Republican Gov. Bill Owens, Secretary of State Donetta Davidson and the GOP legislature in 2003, in a congressional redistricting case.\n\nA divided legislature was unable to draw up new districts based on the 2000 census in time for the 2002 election, and so in January of that year the job fell to the courts, which drew up their own map.\n\nBut Republicans gained control of both Senate and House in November 2002, and \u2014 even though they won five of the seven congressional districts at that election \u2014 they rammed through a redistricting plan at the tail end of 2003 session even more favorable to them, to take effect for the 2004 elections.\n\nSalazar \u2014 on his own, not on behalf of the state \u2014 sued Davidson, the chief elections officer, asking the Colorado Supreme Court to review the constitutionality of the legislature\u2019s new districts.\n\nHe maintained the state constitution gives lawmakers one shot to redistrict after the decennial census. If it fails, and a judge draws a map, they can\u2019t come back later and try again in mid-decade.\n\nSenate President John Andrews, noting that the AG usually represents the secretary of state and other agencies in court, observed that \u201cMr. Salazar suing [Davidson] is like one of the Broncos tackling his own teammate.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the first argument that Salazar had to win was against Davidson\u2019s and Owens\u2019 claim that Salazar had no authority to file the suit in the first place.\n\nSalazar made a strong case, arguing in his brief that the AG has the power \u201cto bring any action which he deems to be necessary for the protection of the public interest.\u201d Even if the governor and secretary of state object, he wrote, the \u201credistricting case embodies his highest responsibility to the people of Colorado \u2014 his protection of the public interest as expressed in the Colorado Constitution.\u201d\n\nThe high court agreed, Chief Justice Mary Mullarkey, writing for the 5-2 majority, rejected Davidson\u2019s argument that the AG is limited to his express statutory powers and noted he has common law powers dating back centuries. The constitutional separation of powers prevents legislators from enacting statutes restricting the high court\u2019s exercise of original jurisdiction.\n\nThe court also rejected the argument that Salazar violated the Colorado Code of Professional Conduct by suing a sometime client. \u201cIn this case, no client confidences are involved,\u201d it said.\n\nAn aide to Salazar, who is now in private practice, said he isn\u2019t giving interviews on the issue. But she sent over a statement in which Salazar \u2014 who has to walk a fine line defending his redistricting suit while condemning Cynthia Coffman\u2019s \u2014 is quoted as saying, \u201cThe only exception for the attorney general to take a position adverse to the governor is where the governor has taken a clearly unlawful position, and then only when certain traditional protocols are followed.\u201d\n\nObviously Coffman believes Hickenlooper has taken a position in favor of an unlawful federal measure. She and her fellow plaintiffs may win, they may lose, but she has the right to sue on behalf of the people.\n\nColorado Republicans still resent the redistricting decision, but if they can salvage anything out of it, it\u2019s Salazar\u2019s strong defense of an AG\u2019s right to sue on behalf of the people without gubernatorial authorization \u2014 or even approval.\n\nLongtime Rocky Mountain News political columnist Peter Blake now writes twice a month for CompleteColorado.com.
