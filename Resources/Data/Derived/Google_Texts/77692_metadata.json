Brindza, who made a 58-yard field goal early in the second quarter, missed an extra point and three field goals in the second half.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always devastating and disappointing,\u201d he said. \u201cI let my team down.\u201d\n\nTampa Bay coach Lovie Smith said he wasn\u2019t considering replacing Brindza after the tough day.\n\n\u201cHe, like a lot of us, had a disappointing day today,\u201d Smith said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have off days. This was an off day. When a player has an off day, we need to rally around him in other ways, and that\u2019s what we weren\u2019t able to do today.\u201d\n\nJ.J. Watt was glad to get the assist from Brindza after Houston\u2019s defense did its job.\n\n\u201cThe field goal kicker kind of helped us out a little bit, so I appreciate that,\u201d Watt said, snickering.\n\nMallett threw for threw for 228 yards and a touchdown and Alfred Blue had 139 yards rushing with a score to lead the Texans to the victory.\n\nBlue had a 20-yard touchdown run after Brindza\u2019s second missed field goal in the fourth quarter, but Randy Bullock missed the extra point to leave Houston up 16-9.\n\nTop overall pick Jameis Winston threw for 261 yards with a touchdown and an interception for Tampa Bay. Mike Evans had 101 yards receiving, but also had a couple of drops.\n\n\u201cI believe we got better as a team,\u201d Winston said. \u201cI believe I got better \u2026 it\u2019s a promising loss. We got some good things out of it.\u201d\n\nBullock added a 19-yard field goal with less than two minutes left.\n\nHopkins, who missed practice this week because of a concussion, finished with eight receptions for 101 yards.\n\nWinston launched a 33-yard pass to Louis Murphy just before he was leveled by Watt early in the fourth quarter. He found Murphy again two plays later for a 19-yard gain, but the offense stalled and\n\nTampa Bay was left empty-handed when Brindza missed from 33 yards.\n\nOn Houston\u2019s next drive Mallett connected with Hopkins for a 30-yard gain and the Texans got another 15 thanks to a facemask penalty. Blue, filling in for injured Arian Foster, capped that drive with his first touchdown this season.\n\nWinston was under pressure from 2014 top overall draftee Jadeveon Clowney early in the third quarter and was intercepted by Quintin Demps. The Texans took a 10-9 lead on Bullock\u2019s 39-yarder.\n\n\u201cHe played pretty good \u2026 we would like to have that one pick back,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWe just didn\u2019t (provide) enough opportunities for him for our offense to really get going.\u201d\n\nThe Buccaneers converted just one of 12 third-down attempts.\n\nVincent Jackson grabbed a 23-yard reception that at first was ruled a touchdown in the third quarter. But the Texans challenged the call and it was reversed; Jackson didn\u2019t get both feet down. Brindza missed a 41-yard field goal.\n\nBrindza\u2019s third miss on a 57-yarder late in the final period.\n\nWatt, who had three touchdown receptions last season, lined up as a tight end for one play, but Houston ran the ball.\n\nMallett was sacked and fumbled near the end of the first quarter and Tampa Bay recovered. But the play was negated because of a defensive holding penalty on Jacquies Smith.\n\nTampa Bay cut the lead to 7-3 early in the second quarter on Brindza\u2019s 58-yard field goal.\n\nMallett\u2019s pass was deflected by Danny Lansanah and Kwon Alexander intercepted later in the quarter. Winston found Sims on a short pass and he dashed 32 yards before flipping into the end zone.\n\nNOTES: The Texans were without LT Duane Brown (hand) for second straight game. \u2026 Tampa Bay LB Lavonte David had 14 tackles. \u2026 Houston CB Johnathan Joseph tied career high with five passes defensed. \u2026 The Texans changed to AstroTurf for Sunday\u2019s game after using natural grass in every game since the stadium opened in 2002.\n\n___\n\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP", "article_metadata": {"description": "Tampa Bay rookie Kyle Brindza made the second-longest field goal in franchise history for the team's first points on Sunday.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Tampa Bay rookie Kyle Brindza made the second-longest field goal in franchise history for the team\u2019s first points on Sunday.", "title": "Rookie kicker hurts Bucs\u2019 chances in 19-9 loss to Houston", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/27/rookie-kicker-hurts-bucs-chances-in-19-9-loss-to-h/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/27/7428e4d578013c2b830f6a7067000408.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/27/7428e4d578013c2b830f6a7067000408.jpg", "description": "Tampa Bay rookie Kyle Brindza made the second-longest field goal in franchise history for the team's first points on Sunday.", "card": "summary", "title": "Rookie kicker hurts Bucs\u2019 chances in 19-9 loss to Houston"}, "Author": "KRISTIE RIEKEN", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "His day went downhill after that and it helped the Houston Texans to a 19-9 win.\nBrindza, who made a 58-yard field goal early in the second quarter, missed an extra point and three field goals in the second half.\nHOUSTON (AP) - Tampa Bay rookie Kyle Brindza made the second-longest field goal in franchise history for the team\u2019s first points on Sunday.\nBlue had a 20-yard touchdown run after Brindza\u2019s second missed field goal in the fourth quarter, but Randy Bullock missed the extra point to leave Houston up 16-9.\nTampa Bay cut the lead to 7-3 early in the second quarter on Brindza\u2019s 58-yard field goal."}
