Chris Christie signed the CARE Act into Law.\n\nJust minutes ago, the New Jersey Assembly passed the Caregiver Advise, Record, Enable (CARE) Act. Already approved by the Senate without a single no vote, the CARE Act now heads to Gov. Chris Christie for his signature. Once enacted, it will support the 1.75 million family caregivers in New Jersey as their loved ones go into the hospital and as they transition home.\n\nWhat is the CARE Act?\n\nThe CARE Act takes three commonsense actions that will make a world of a difference to family caregivers by requiring hospitals to:\n\nIdentify a designated family caregiver when a patient is admitted. Notify the caregiver when the patient is to be moved or discharged. Provide that caregiver with adequate instruction for the care of the patient following the patient\u2019s discharge from the hospital.\n\n\n\nWhy is the CARE Act needed?\n\nAs a caregiver for my parents for 15 years, I know firsthand the importance and need for the CARE Act. For many, like me, family caregiving is more than just household chores and rides to the doctor. Family caregivers are often asked to perform medical/nursing tasks such as medication changes, wound care, nebulizers and more that can quickly become part of a daily routine. Ann of Berlin, N.J., is one of these family caregivers. She shares:\n\n\u201cI had no training, I was scared to death.\u201d\n\nIn fact, 72 percent of family caregivers in New Jersey report performing medical and nursing tasks when caring for a loved one. Even more think hospitals can help by:\n\ndemonstrating medical tasks (96 percent)\n\nkeeping caregivers informed of major decisions (92 percent)\n\nrecording caregiver information upon admission (87 percent)\n\nWill New Jersey enact the CARE Act?\n\nThat decision is now in Gov. Christie\u2019s hands. Jim Dieterle, AARP New Jersey state director, says:\n\n\u201cAARP New Jersey urges Gov. Christie to sign the CARE Act now, and provide critically important help for New Jersey\u2019s family caregivers and their loved ones.\u201d\n\nThanks to the strong leadership of the primary sponsors of the CARE Act \u2014 Assembly Speaker Vincent Prieto; Assembly members Joseph Lagana, Bob Andrzejczak, Daniel Benson and Vincent Mazzeo; state Sens. Joe Vitale, Robert W. Singer and Linda Greenstein \u2014 the CARE Act passed the legislature!\n\nAssembly Speaker Vincent Prieto:\n\n\u201cBy having hospitals work cooperatively with a patient\u2019s preferred caregiver, we can ensure that they\u2019re getting the level of care they need from the person they feel most comfortable with.\u201d\n\nState Sen. Joe Vitale is chair of the Health, Human Services and Senior Citizens Committee:\n\n\u201cWe have many stories in our office of folks who have come in and said my dad came home from the hospital with cancer \u2026 but we didn\u2019t know what to do \u2026 didn\u2019t know how to feed him, didn\u2019t know how to change a bed with him in it.\u201d\n\nI hope New Jersey becomes the second state in the nation, following Oklahoma, to support family caregivers with the CARE Act. More than 1.75 million Garden Staters are counting on it.\n\nGov. Mary Fallin of Oklahoma encourages other states to follow in enacting the CARE Act and supporting family caregivers:\n\nI\u2019ll be watching closely as other states tee up the CARE Act for 2015.
