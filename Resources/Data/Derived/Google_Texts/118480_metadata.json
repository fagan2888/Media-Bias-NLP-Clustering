Sixty percent of American voters \u2013 the highest number among candidates running for president \u2013 say she is not honest and trustworthy, according to a Quinnipiac University poll in November.\n\nHer cozy ties to a vast network of wealthy donors who have raised more than $3 billion in support of the Clintons\u2019 political and philanthropic efforts over four decades have made Americans question whether she is fighting for us or for the large campaign donors supporting her.\n\nShe is not helping her cause by repeating an illogical and self-serving talking point referencing 9/11 to defend against charges that she is too close to Wall Street.\n\nWhen debate moderators asked if the millions of dollars in campaign contributions and speaking fees from Wall Street make her too indebted to financial interests, she replied, \u201cWe were attacked in downtown Manhattan where Wall Street is. I did spend a whole lot of time and effort helping them rebuild.\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019s a better answer staring her in the face! It\u2019s the first issue listed on her website: Campaign finance reform.\n\nBuilding trust with Americans starts with championing a real plan to fight big money in politics and ensure Americans on Main Street have just as much voice on Capitol Hill and in the White House as the financiers on Wall Street.\n\nClinton has such a plan but it\u2019s just been picking up dust on the shelf since she released it back in September.\n\nHer Proposals to Restore Integrity to American Elections garnered widespread praise from leading campaign finance reform advocates, including the organization where I work. Her proposed solutions, as well as those of Bernie Sanders and Martin O\u2019Malley, closely resemble a comprehensive reform agenda released by Democracy Matters and 11 other national organizations working to reduce the pervasive influence of big money in our elections.\n\nThe holistic plan recognizes that no one solution will fully rebalance the system in favor of voters instead of wealthy donors, but rather we must take simultaneous action on several fronts. We must amplify the voices of everyday Americans in the political process by implementing public financing of elections that encourage more small donors to participate. We must also overturn disastrous Supreme Court decisions like Citizens United v. FEC and Buckley v. Valeo, which limit our ability to prevent big donors from buying special influence. And we must protect the public\u2019s right to know who is spending money to influence our elected officials by \u201cending secret, unaccountable money\u201d in elections.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It's hard to win when 60 percent of voters doubt your honesty.
