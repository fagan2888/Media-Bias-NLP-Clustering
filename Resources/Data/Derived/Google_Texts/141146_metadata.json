LOUIS \u2014 Yohan Flande is certainly not the savior for the Rockies\u2019 fragile rotation, but he\u2019s made a strong case as a reasonable short-term solution.\n\nThe left-hander started twice on the Rockies\u2019 road trip through Chicago and St. Louis, acquitting himself well. He was particularly effective Sunday, despite the Rockies\u2019 3-2, walk-off loss to the Cardinals at Busch Stadium.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a strike thrower,\u201d manager Walt Weiss said. \u201cThat\u2019s what he does, and he sinks the ball. He has a good changeup, and that\u2019s what he did again today.\u201d\n\nFlande, 29, pitched five solid innings Sunday, allowing two runs and four hits. He struck out three and didn\u2019t walk a batter. His one mistake was a big one. In the fifth inning he left a changeup hanging over the plate and Jayson Heyward feasted, sending the pitch over the center-field fence for a 2-0 St. Louis lead.\n\nTuesday in Chicago, Flande earned the first win of his major-league career, allowing one run and four hits in five innings of Colorado\u2019s 7-2 victory.\n\n\u201cI want to take advantage of the opportunity,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to be a starter, but as long as I have an opportunity to be in the big leagues, I won\u2019t say anything bad if I go back to the bullpen. But now, with everybody hurt, there is an open door for me.\u201d\n\nFlande is taking his cues from left-hander Jorge De La Rosa, the Rockies\u2019 best pitcher. He beat the Cardinals on Saturday.\n\n\u201cIt helps when I watch De La Rosa pitch,\u201d Flande said. \u201cHe obviously threw a tremendous game yesterday and I am following a really good pitcher. I was pretty much trying to follow what he did yesterday.\u201d\n\nKendrick update. Right-hander Kyle Kendrick, the veteran whom the Rockies signed to a one-year, $5.5 million contract, is scheduled to have an MRI on his inflamed right shoulder Monday. He said the big fear is that he has a torn rotator cuff, which would almost certainly end his brief career with the Rockies.\n\nKendrick, 4-12 with a 6.43 ERA in 21 starts, has struggled most of the season. But he was particularly bad Friday against the Cardinals when he pitched just one inning before being lifted because of shoulder pain.\n\nWeiss, however, said Kendrick had not been pitching through pain in starts leading up to Friday\u2019s game.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been fine,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cHe had some shoulder fatigue before the (all-star) break, but he was never in pain; he\u2019s never had any pain.\n\n\u201cThere was no reason to take him out of the rotation, physically. Everything was the same. It\u2019s a little bit more sore this time, and we saw the drop in velocity (down to an 83 mph fastball). So that was a red flag in his last start.\u201d\n\nFootnotes. Weiss said he expects to announce Monday the starter who will replace Kendrick for Wednesday\u2019s home game against the Mariners. \u2026 Leadoff hitter Charlie Blackmon swiped two bases Sunday to give him 29 this year, setting a career high.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nMariners\u2019 Felix Hernandez (12-6, 3.02 ERA) at Rockies\u2019 Eddie Butler (3-7, 4.82), 6:40 p.m. Monday, ROOT; 850 AM\n\nHernandez has been dominant in 18 of his 21 starts, posting a 1.72 ERA. But he\u2019s had some bad outings, giving up seven or more runs three times. The Diamondbacks blasted him for seven runs and a season-high 12 hits in 6 innings last week. Butler will be making his first start against an American League club. The rookie right-hander remains a work in progress, pitching well one batter, losing command the next. Butler is 2-4 with a 5.84 ERA in seven outings at Coors Field.\n\nTuesday: Mariners\u2019 Vidal Nu\u00f1o (0-1, 2.02 ERA) at Rockies\u2019 Chris Rusin (3-4, 4.61), 6:40 p.m., ROOT\n\nWednesday: Mariners\u2019 Taijuan Walker (8-7, 4.73) at Rockies\u2019 TBA, 1:10 p.m., ROOT\n\nThursday: Off\n\nFriday: Rockies\u2019 Jorge De La Rosa (7-4, 4.87) at Nationals\u2019 Jordan Zimmermann (8-6, 3.36), 5:05 p.m., ROOT\n\nPatrick Saunders, The Denver Post", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Yohan Flande starting to show he may stay in starting rotation", "title": "Yohan Flande starting to show he may stay in starting rotation", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/08/02/yohan-flande-starting-to-show-he-may-stay-in-starting-rotation/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150802__yohan-flandep1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150802__yohan-flandep1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-02T20:44:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T06:30:57+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The Diamondbacks blasted him for seven runs and a season-high 12 hits in 6 innings last week.\nST.
