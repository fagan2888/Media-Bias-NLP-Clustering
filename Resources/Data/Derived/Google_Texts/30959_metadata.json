But after her baby is born, instead of spending time with her newly expanded family, the Utah resident will be rushed to undergo an MRI, and then begin chemotherapy to treat a rare, incurable form of brain cancer.\n\nHerbert, 30, learned of her diagnosis after suffering a seizure in March. When examined, doctors discovered a four-inch tumor, called an anaplastic astrocytoma, on the right side of her brain. The median survival rate for the cancer is two to three years.\n\nThe diagnosis was \u201cdevastating and life-altering,\u201d Jessica told TODAY.\n\nHerbert has chosen to remain positive, and believes that by doing so, she may help her prognosis and allow her family a smoother journey.\n\nThe chemotherapy and radiation she will receive may shrink the tumor.\n\nHerbert\u2019s husband, Eric, and daughters Harlow, 5, and Harper, 3, are cherishing the memories they are making with their wife and mom.\n\n\u201cI do not take anything for granted anymore,\u201d Eric told TODAY. \u201cEach moment is a gift and we have no idea when the gifts are going to stop coming, so we have to cherish each one.\u201d\n\nThe family plans to spend as much time together while Jessica is still feeling well as possible.\n\n\u201cJessica is hands down the strongest woman I that I have ever met. She inspires me daily to be a better person, better father, and better husband. Our real hope in all of this is that we can help to inspire people to stay positive and never give up no matter the situation,\u201d Eric added.\n\nJeremiah and Lindsay Johnson, Jessica\u2019s brother and his wife, created a You Caring Fundraising page to raise money for the family to travel and make lasting memories.\n\n\u201cOur wish is for Jessica and her family to enjoy every minute they have together,\u201d they wrote, describing Jessica as \u201ccreative, vibrant, and kind,\u201d and \u201ca woman of hope and faith.\u201d\n\nThe page has so far raised $27,037 of the $30,000 goal. All of the money raised will go towards allowing the family to go on adventures together, taking photos and videos for the girls to remember their mother by along the way.\n\n\u201cTime is all I can give my loved ones,\u201d Jessica said. \u201cMy goal for the future is to stay as positive as I possibly can and make the most out of my time with my family and loved ones.\u201d\n\nSo far, the family has been on a trip to Disneyland and to a beach town in California.\n\n\u201cFor me, positivity is key. It definitely doesn\u2019t come easily, but in order to help your body heal, a good state of mind is really the best you can do for yourself,\u201d Jessica added.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Herbert family remains positive despite Jessica Herbert's incurable brain cancer diagnosis.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The Herbert family remains positive despite Jessica Herbert's incurable brain cancer diagnosis.", "title": "Family Remains Positive Despite Incurable Cancer Diagnosis", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150717_HerbertFamily.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-07-18T02:02:56+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1fbzyiB"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The Herbert family remains positive despite Jessica Herbert's incurable brain cancer diagnosis.", "title": "Family Remains Positive Despite Incurable Cancer Diagnosis", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150717_HerbertFamily.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "Protecting Life", "published_time": "2015-07-17T17:14:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-18T02:02:56+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Jessica Herbert, brain cancer, positive"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb94d\"", "article_summary": "The diagnosis was \u201cdevastating and life-altering,\u201d Jessica told TODAY.\n\u201cI do not take anything for granted anymore,\u201d Eric told TODAY.\nShe inspires me daily to be a better person, better father, and better husband.\nHerbert has chosen to remain positive, and believes that by doing so, she may help her prognosis and allow her family a smoother journey.\nFor Jessica Herbert and her young family, this should be a very happy time."}
