And there\u2019s much more to come, including exterior artwork that will be an unmistakable signal to visitors that the center\u2019s purpose and contents are unique to Southeast Alaska.\n\nThree major art pieces are planned for the building, each created by a Northwest Coast master artist (their names should be released within the month, according to SHI). Outside the building, two large carved Haida panels will flank the front entrance all the way up to the roofline. Inside, a 40-by-12-foot Tsimshian house screen will be installed in the multi-level atrium inside in the front entrance that will be visible from the street. Also inside, a contemporary Tlingit panel will anchor the building\u2019s clan house on the first floor. These three pieces will honor the three indigenous cultures of Southeast Alaska and will represent major additions to the contemporary art on display in the capital city.\n\nThough art and its creation is likely to be the most obvious access point for visitors, it is only one aspect of the Soboleff Center. The building will combine elements of a museum, library, performance space, art gallery, learning center, heritage center and a research facility. Each of these functions offers an opportunity for visitors to put the center\u2019s artwork in context as part of a more complete picture of the cultures it honors and represents.\n\nThe first floor will hold a clan house, a gallery with reconfigurable walls and an expanded retail store, currently housed in the lobby of the Sealaska building, where Southeast Native artists can sell their work. During an early tour of the building Tuesday, SHI\u2019s chief operating officer Lee Kadinger said the retail space is also a good location to help educate tourists and others about Northwest Coast art and SHI\u2019s larger mission.\n\n\u201cWe offer weaving classes, carving classes, skin sewing classes. Our goal is to perpetuate and enhance Northwest Coast art in addition to the culture, and it really brings our art programs full circle when we\u2019re able to teach those classes ... and then provide a space for (artists) to sell those items,\u201d Kadinger said. \u201cThen those funds go back into teaching more youth and adults in the future.\u201d\n\nThe first floor will also host an office for the center\u2019s artist in residence, a new program SHI is excited about implementing, Kadinger said.\n\n\u201cThey will have direct access to the collections space where they can go down and look at a clan hat or a war helmet from 200 years ago and have it inspire what they\u2019re working on today,\u201d he said.\n\nResearch facilities will be concentrated on the center\u2019s lower level, where visitors will be able to study materials from the collections vault with help from the curator across the hall. SHI\u2019s collection includes 1,000 art and ethnographic objects, a library of 2,500 books, more than 5,000 historical and contemporary audio and audiovisual recordings, and more than 60,000 historic photographs. Some of these materials are available online.\n\nIn addition, SHI\u2019s collection of Tlingit, Haida and Tsimshian language recordings is the largest collection of its kind in the world, according to Kathy Dye, SHI\u2019s media and publications director.Language revitalization is becoming more of a priority with so few speakers alive today. According to SHI, there are only 120 Tlingit speakers, 3 Haida and 10 Tsimshian.\n\nLanguage revitalization is also one potential focus of the educational facilities on the second floor, where a large classroom space is being designed to support both on-site and distance learning through video feeds and other technology.\n\n\u201cWe can do language classes in here and broadcast them out on the internet, maybe we could have a carving class or a skin sewing class that we broadcast out on the internet and whoever, wherever they are, they can tune in and follow along if they like,\u201d Kadinger said.\n\nThis \u201cliving history\u201d room will also likely be the spot for SHI\u2019s Native lecture series, which they hope to expand from being held only in November to year-round. Like the center itself, the lecture series is designed to promote cross-cultural understanding of the indigenous cultures of Southeast Alaska.\n\nThe 30,000-square-foot building, named in honor of highly-regarded Tlingit elder Dr. Walter A. Soboleff, was designed by Juneau firm MRV Architects in conjunction with SHI and a panel of Native elders. It is being built by Dawson Construction and is projected to cost $20 million. A grand opening is scheduled for next spring.\n\nTo learn more, visit http://www.sealaskaheritagecenter.com.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Alaska, Juneau, newspaper, news, legislature, capital, Mendenhall, Douglas, southeast, Douglas Island, Gastineau Channel, Mendenhall Glacier, Auke Bay, Salmon Creek, Lemon Creek, Switzer Creek, Mendenhall Valley, Fritz Cove, Lynn Canal, Tee Harbor, Local, Amy Fletcher, Lee Kadinger, Walter A.
