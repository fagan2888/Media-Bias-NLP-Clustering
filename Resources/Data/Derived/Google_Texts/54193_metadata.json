Each man punished the other with leg kicks, and Bisping sustained a toe injury at the end of the first round, limiting his mobility. Bisping and Leites both charged in often in the following rounds, hitting flurries of punches in which Bisping landed more, ultimately gaining him the decision.\n\n\u201cGlasgow is a beautiful city,\u201d Bisping proclaimed. \u201cThales Leites is a warrior.\u201d\n\nThe Englishman then went on to challenge some of the middleweight division\u2019s heavy-hitters, including Yoel Romero and Jacare Souza.\n\nAlso, Xtreme Couture fighter Evan Dunham beat fellow American Ross Pearson by unanimous decision.\n\nIreland\u2019s Joe Duffy, the last man to beat UFC interim featherweight champion Conor McGregor, looked as composed as his more famous compatriot in defeating Brazil\u2019s Ivan Jorge. Duffy was clinical, needing just one opportunity on the ground to get a submission from a triangle choke.\n\nIn a women\u2019s bout, Scotland\u2019s Joanne Calderwood beat American Cortney Casey by unanimous decision.\n\nThe local straw-weight competitor was staggered by several right crosses in the first round, but was able to get better shots off in the second, backing her opponent against the cage and landing on top as the bout dropped to the canvas. In a weary third round, she went to the midsection, winning the duels that gave her victory on all three scorecards.\n\n\u201cThis has been a really tough fight camp for me so it\u2019s great to get the win,\u201d Calderwood noted. \u201cI\u2019ve always been a slow starter. I was just enjoying it so much out there. As long as I put on a good performance for the fans, that\u2019s all I want.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Michael Bisping outpoints Brazil\u2019s Thales Leites in Scotland UFC action", "title": "Michael Bisping outpoints Brazil\u2019s Thales Leites in Scotland UFC action", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/07/18/michael-bisping-outpoints-brazils-thales-leites-in-scotland-ufc-action/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150718_045116_michael-bisping.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150718_045116_michael-bisping.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-18T16:44:07+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T23:42:21+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc512\"", "article_summary": "GLASGOW, Scotland \u2014 British star Michael Bisping won a split decision over Brazil\u2019s Thales Leites on Saturday night in the Ultimate Fighting Championship\u2019s first card in Scotland.\n\u201cThales Leites is a warrior.\u201dThe Englishman then went on to challenge some of the middleweight division\u2019s heavy-hitters, including Yoel Romero and Jacare Souza.\nLeites controlled the center of the cage for much of the bout, with Bisping circling to jab at every opportunity.\nBisping and Leites both charged in often in the following rounds, hitting flurries of punches in which Bisping landed more, ultimately gaining him the decision.\nEach man punished the other with leg kicks, and Bisping sustained a toe injury at the end of the first round, limiting his mobility."}
