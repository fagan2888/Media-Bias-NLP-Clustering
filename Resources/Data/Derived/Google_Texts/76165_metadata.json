However, somebody has to do something about this,\u201d Doboszenski said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in the way the government is going. I don\u2019t believe a company like ours should be forced to pay for things we don\u2019t believe in.\u201d\n\nThe suburban Twin Cities company filed a federal lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, obtaining a temporary injunction against the HHS mandate last November in U.S. District Court.\n\nYet the family-owned enterprise may be running out of time. Its temporary exemption hinges on the outcome of two similar cases expected to be decided this month by the U.S. Supreme Court (Sibelius v. Hobby Lobby and Sibelius v. Conestoga Wood.)\n\n\u201cI have three things I was worried about in doing this lawsuit. How\u2019s the IRS, and how\u2019s the government, going to retaliate, that was first and foremost,\u201d Doboszenski said. \u201cSecond, the last few years haven\u2019t been kind to the construction industry and it took a $10,000 bill for lawyer fees to put this in place. Thirdly, there\u2019s a possibility some employees will be happy and a possibility some will be upset about it.\u201d\n\nAltogether, Minnesota for-profit companies won eight out of 35 temporary injunctions obtained in federal courts by businesses across the country under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.\n\n\u201cI think of all the states, the most for-profit company cases have been brought in Minnesota,\u201d said Erick Kaardal, an attorney representing seven companies that won temporary federal injunctions. \u201cI attribute that to the vibrant Christian community here. We represent Catholic-owned businesses and also Protestant-owned businesses and they\u2019re very upset that their religious liberties are being violated by the federal government in this way.\u201d\n\nBusiness owners may object to different parts of the required coverage, but all maintain the mandate violates their free exercise of religion.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t about cost. We provide health care for our employees and we love to. We\u2019ve done it forever and we continue to do it,\u201d said Doug Erickson, who provides medical coverage for about 60 employees at two Twin Cities auto dealerships. \u201cIt\u2019s really about a small piece of this bill and the fact that we don\u2019t agree with some of the language of abortion-inducing medication or drugs.\u201d\n\nEven after obtaining a federal injunction, however, Erickson ran into another obstacle. Erickson\u2019s attorney with the Liberty Institute, a national legal organization that defends religious liberty rights, said the businessman\u2019s insurance provider expressed concerns about amending the company\u2019s medical policy to reflect the exemption. Despite winning in federal court, Erickson\u2019s company policy must continue to provide the mandated medical coverage he opposes for now.\n\n\u201cAs of January 1 of this year, he\u2019s had to provide those medications,\u201d said Jeremy Dys, a Liberty Institute attorney representing Erickson. \u201cHe\u2019s just hoping and praying that none of his employees are taking advantage of the ACA\u2019s provision of these abortifacients right now.\u201d\n\nOther companies are also keeping a close watch as the current Supreme Court term winds to a close. Kaardal said several businesses are standing by to file injunctions from the ACA mandate on the grounds of sincere religious objections, depending on the outcome of the Hobby Lobby case.\n\nThe owner of a St. Joseph manufacturing plant with an ACA exemption underscored the gravity with which employers view the Supreme Court case.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to take this course. It\u2019s expensive, it\u2019s been a lot of stress and strain,\u201d said Gregory Hall, owner of American Manufacturing Company and an ordained deacon. \u201cBut I just hope our fellow Catholics and believers and even unbelievers will understand, that if we let the government force us to buy something that violates our conscience, where does that end?\u201d\n\nContact Tom Steward at tsteward@watchdog.org.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Doug Doboszenski moves tons of dirt in his excavation business, but nothing like trying to move the mountain known as the federal government.\r\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, Doboszenki and Sons must provide health coverage in employee medical plans that contradicts the owners\u2019 religious beliefs \u2014 or face thousands of dollars in Internal Revenue Service fines.\r\n\r\nDoboszenski maintains the ACA violates his rights under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act through the employer requirement to provide mandated contraceptive, abortion-inducing drugs and elective sterilization coverage.", "title": "MN employers look to Supreme Court for ACA religious exemption - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/10/Kaardal-pix.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-06-18T13:25:43+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/155225/mn-employers-look-supreme-court-aca-religious-exemption/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Health Care", "tag": "Becket Fund,Business,Conestoga Wood Specialties,Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals,Hobby Lobby,Liberty Institute,Sibelius,Supreme Court", "published_time": "2014-06-18T13:18:48+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-18T13:25:43+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Doug Doboszenski moves tons of dirt in his excavation business, but nothing like trying to move the mountain known as the federal government.\r\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, Doboszenki and Sons must provide health coverage in employee medical plans that contradicts the owners\u2019 religious beliefs \u2014 or face thousands of dollars in Internal Revenue Service fines.\r\n\r\nDoboszenski maintains the ACA violates his rights under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act through the employer requirement to provide mandated contraceptive, abortion-inducing drugs and elective sterilization coverage.", "title": "MN employers look to Supreme Court for ACA religious exemption - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/06/Doboszenski-Sons.jpg"}, "creator": "@watchdogorg", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive"}, "article_summary": "Despite winning in federal court, Erickson\u2019s company policy must continue to provide the mandated medical coverage he opposes for now.\nThe owner of a St. Joseph manufacturing plant with an ACA exemption underscored the gravity with which employers view the Supreme Court case.\nDoboszenski maintains the ACA violates his rights under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act through the employer requirement to provide mandated contraceptive, abortion-inducing drugs and elective sterilization coverage.\nWe\u2019ve done it forever and we continue to do it,\u201d said Doug Erickson, who provides medical coverage for about 60 employees at two Twin Cities auto dealerships.\n\u201cAs a small business owner and just a regular citizen, you don\u2019t feel you have that much control over this stuff."}
