My God, the Republicans are so transparently opportunistic. Having failed over six years trying to dislodge the Democrats’ control of the Senate by using Obamacare, the economy and the border with Mexico, they’re changing tactics. Why? Because Obamacare works and is popular with people who use it, the economy is vastly improved and immigration reform is dead in the water of the Rio Grande. Now they’re going to blame the Democrats for Ebola and ISIS. It’s laughable. Well, it is to me as you can see by today’s cartoon. One of my favorite political maxims is: In a democracy, people get the kind of government they deserve. If the Republicans capture the Senate, we’ll certainly see how that unfolds.
