That has helped fuel a movement to combat climate change among health-care professionals, who are tackling both global warming's impact on public health as well as their own carbon footprint.\n\nThe report also warned that much of that damage is already being done. During the talks, Beijing\u2019s record-breaking\u2014and ongoing\u2014smog alert vividly illustrated the threat that fossil fuel-driven climate change poses for public health. Ironically, Beijing\u2019s historic pollution alerts coincided with stubborn Chinese resistance to climate proposals on the table in Paris.\n\nBut Beijing is hardly the only nation with a pollution problem. According to WHO estimates, diseases related to air pollution kill seven million people every year, accounting for one in every eight deaths globally every year. Left unmitigated, the WHO predicts, climate change could, by 2030, lead to an additional 250,000 deaths each year from malaria, diarrheal disease, heat stress, and malnutrition.\n\n\u201cThe health sector has really come alive to the realities of climate change,\u201d says Gary Cohen, president of Health Care Without Harm, a network of public health organizations. In a global campaign that\u2019s been likened to the tobacco control movement of the 1990s, health professionals and advocates worldwide have joined forces to push for urgent climate action, and for public health to be a bigger part of the fight against climate change.\n\nIn Paris, a coalition of some 1,700 health associations, 13 million doctors and health professionals, along with more than 8,000 hospitals, joined the WHO in calling for a robust international deal to protect public health. Even before the Paris talks, health organizations had begun to take action to reduce their carbon footprints, divest from the fossil-fuel industry, and address the impact of climate change in their communities.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re beginning to ask: What is health care for?\u201d says Cohen. \u201cMostly right now it\u2019s about treating chronic disease, but going forward, health care needs to reinvent itself to heal communities and the planet.\u201d\n\nFor health advocates, the deal that came out of Paris is, at best, a good first step. On the plus side, the Paris agreement explicitly sets out to hold global warming below 2 degrees Celsius over the next century\u2014the limit scientists say is necessary to avert catastrophic warming. Advocates also praise the deal\u2019s five-year review mechanism, set to kick in by 2018, which is designed to hold countries to their climate pledges.\n\nBut the agreement also left out many core provisions that advocates say are critical to protecting public health on a warming planet. In particular, the agreement earmarks no financial support for health systems in the developing world, which faces unique challenges in responding to global warming\u2019s impacts.\n\nNor does the agreement commit to quickly phasing out coal production or ending fossil-fuel subsidies, both of which advocates say have immediate public health implications. According to a May study by the International Monetary Fund, global subsidies to the fossil-fuel industry outweigh public health spending by all governments worldwide.\n\nFinally, the agreement does little to account for the very real health benefits and risks associated with different mitigation strategies, say health organizers who attended the talks in Paris.\n\nYet these disappointments do not negate the agreement\u2019s positive impact, says Nick Watts, lead author of the Lancet Commission study and coordinator for the Global Climate and Health Alliance, a worldwide network launched during the 2011 UN climate summit in Durban, South Africa.\n\n\u201cThe biggest priority is a strong agreement,\u201d says Watts, adding that these details are important but that without the global accord, \u201cunmitigated climate change would be a public health catastrophe.\u201d\n\nHealth providers not only stand on the front lines of climate change\u2019s most immediate impacts, they\u2019ve also begun to track and reduce their own significant carbon footprint. According to a 2009 University of Chicago study, the health sector accounts for 8 percent of overall U.S. carbon emissions, due to hospitals\u2019 enormous demand for energy and the manufacture and transport of pharmaceutical drugs.\n\nProgressive health-care advocates tackled that problem head-on early this year with a global call to action dubbed the 2020 Health Care Climate Challenge, led by Health Care Without Harm, an international health-care coalition. Participants include some 1,200 hospitals and care centers throughout the United States, which alongside several thousand participating health organizations worldwide have pledged to dramatically reduce their emissions by 2020. Coalition members have also pledged to invest in renewable energy, and to push for climate-friendly health-care policies at the local and national levels. The 2020 Challenge is the first global effort to track and reduce the health sector\u2019s impact on climate change.\n\nHealth Care Without Harm President Gary Cohen compares the initiative to the medical community\u2019s successful anti-tobacco campaign beginning in the 1990s. \u201cInitially, it was a question of getting doctors and nurses to stop smoking,\u201d he says. \u201cHere, we\u2019re getting health care to focus on its own footprint. But that\u2019s only the beginning.\u201d\n\nFollowing the tobacco control playbook, the health sector has also begun to divest from the fossil fuel industry in a big way. Already the British Medical Association, the Canadian Medical Association, and the Royal Australasian College of Physicians have committed to keeping their money out of fossil fuels.\n\nAnd on December 3, an American hospital system known as Dignity Health became the largest U.S. health industry player to divest its holdings from the coal industry. Dignity operates more than 400 hospitals and care centers across California, Arizona, and Nevada. Health advocates say they expect to see industry fossil-fuel divestments gain momentum in the coming years.\n\n\u201cMost of the medical associations around the world won\u2019t hold investments in tobacco, alcohol, ammunitions,\u201d predicts Watts. \u201cIt\u2019s about removing the social license\u2014it\u2019s not something we want to be a part of.\u201d\n\nThe bigger challenge, though, will be picking up the pieces after climate disasters.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at the very early stages of understanding how health care will respond to climate change,\u201d says Cohen. A warming planet may not only trigger extreme weather and the spread of disease; it may also impact the ability of health systems to respond to those threats.\n\n\u201cWhat we learned from Katrina and Sandy is the health sector is not prepared,\" says Cohen, referring to the hurricanes that devastated the Gulf Coast and parts of the Northeast in 2005 and 2012.\n\nBut that is beginning to change. Recently, a handful of U.S. health providers have begun to account for how climate change may impact wellness in their communities. Building on the 2010 Affordable Care Act\u2019s formula for tracking local community health needs, some providers are beginning to also plan for such climate-fueled impacts as waterborne illness, heat stress, and extreme weather within their communities.\n\nFor example, health centers run by Gundersen Health System, a Wisconsin-based provider that has also frozen its fossil-fuel divestments, and by California-based Kaiser Permanente, have begun to plan for the health consequences of climate change on a local scale.\n\n\u201cUltimately what we\u2019d like to see is every hospital in the country developing a climate action plan,\u201d says Cohen.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The American Prospect", "description": "The Paris climate treaty has mobilized the health care industry and may be the most important public health accord of our time.", "title": "Climate Accord Mobilizes Health Industry", "url": "http://prospect.org/article/climate-accord-mobilizes-health-industry", "image": "http://prospect.org/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/paris_climate_demo_1.jpg?itok=260umywj", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "4dItj6FrXn-I63uD7pcvQKf3n3Qc6AIxiwwzo0_G4zk", "fb": {"admins": 431364, "app_id": 107113422697949}, "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "viewport": "initial-scale = 1.0, width = device-width"}, "article_summary": "And on December 3, an American hospital system known as Dignity Health became the largest U.S. health industry player to divest its holdings from the coal industry.\n\u201cThe health sector has really come alive to the realities of climate change,\u201d says Gary Cohen, president of Health Care Without Harm, a network of public health organizations.\nDuring the talks, Beijing\u2019s record-breaking\u2014and ongoing\u2014smog alert vividly illustrated the threat that fossil fuel-driven climate change poses for public health.\n(AP Photos/Matt Dunham) Public health advocates were among those demonstrating at the recent Paris climate talks.\n\u201cWe\u2019re at the very early stages of understanding how health care will respond to climate change,\u201d says Cohen."}
