(Photo: Michael Izzo/Staff photo )Buy Photo\n\nSome of the best speed skaters in the world were at Mennen Arena this week, led by two gold medal-winning Chinese Olympians.\n\nSun Linlin\u2019s International Garden State Speedskating Camp brought top talent from the East Coast and overseas from China, Taiwan and Israel to the arena where about 40 people, ages 6 to 50, had signed up for the five-day event.\n\nThe camp was designed to be a fun summer activity with a serious purpose: to improve speed skating skills and introduce young athletes to those from other areas of the world.\n\n\u201cWe have some of the top ranked junior skaters here in their age group, all here to train together in this camp. I\u2019m proud to bridge the gap in nationalities,\u201d said Tony Liu, president of Garden State Speedskating, a 36-year-old club run out of Mennen Arena. Liu brought Chinese Olympic gold medalist Sun Linlin to instruct the course.\n\n\u201cWe wanted Linlin to instruct, promote, and spread speed skating internationally and in the U.S. while providing a camp experience,\u201d Liu said. \u201cTo travel this far is a lot of sacrifice, but that\u2019s her passion to teach.\u201d\n\nThis was Sun\u2019s third camp in America, but her first in New Jersey.\n\n\u201cI love my sport and I want to help these kids,\u201d Sun said.\n\nSun invited a guest coach, Meng Wang, a four-time Olympic gold medalist, the most decorated Chinese Winter Olympic athlete ever, and a world record holder.\n\n\u201cShe is like the Michael Phelps of speed skating,\u201d Liu said.\n\nMonday through Thursday consisted of two four-hour sessions per day, and Friday morning was the final skating session of the camp. The sessions featured racing, exercises, drills, and fun and games, including skating through a tunnel made out of protective mats.\n\n\u201cI liked getting to skate with my friends,\u201d said Katherine Liu, 11, of Basking Ridge. \u201cAnd the games. I liked going through the tunnels of mats.\u201d\n\nHer 8-year-old brother, Justin, just liked skating as fast as he could.\n\nSun said she\u2019s seen serious improvement since the camp began Monday, and even from Thursday evening to Friday morning.\n\nMuch of the camp was focused on the fundamentals.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t have the foundation, there is no high level,\u201d Sun said.\n\nSun brought six speed-skating children from China, varying in age from 6 to 14 years old, including two of the country\u2019s top juvenile skaters.\n\n\u201cI want Chinese skaters to learn the culture, and everyone to learn from each other and make friends,\u201d Sun said. \u201cWhen I was little, I didn\u2019t have the chance. That\u2019s why I do this.\u201d\n\nLiu was extremely pleased with the positive response and the turnout of about 40 skaters from all ages and skill sets, some beginners and others internationally ranked.\n\nFar from a beginner was Yoni Subin, 16, of Washington, D.C., who has Israeli citizenship and skates in world events for that country.\n\n\u201cI started seven years ago with simple ice rink lessons and realized I wanted to go fast,\u201d Subin said. \u201cI realized there must be a sport for that somewhere.\u201d\n\nSun plans to continue to work with Garden State Speedskating, and hold a winter camp at Mennen Arena this year.\n\n\u201cLinlin can offer tremendous support to local speed skaters,\u201d Liu said. \u201cWe want to emphasize international speed skating here in Morris County. This is our home rink and we want to support the kids here who want to learn.\u201d\n\nSun said she can sense the kids need a coach here.\n\n\u201cI can feel they need me. That\u2019s why I came, that\u2019s why I\u2019m staying,\u201d Sun said. \u201cI\u2019ve got so much to say and so much to teach. This was just the beginning.\u201d\n\nStaff Writer Michael Izzo: 973-428-6636; mizzo@dailyrecord.com\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1mqC0T1", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Some of the best speed skaters in the world were at Mennen Arena this week.", "og": {"site_name": "Asbury Park Press", "description": "Some of the best speed skaters in the world were at Mennen Arena this week.", "title": "Chinese Olympians teach speed skating in Morris Twp", "url": "http://www.app.com/story/news/local/new-jersey/2014/07/12/chinese-olympians-teach-speed-skating-morris-twp/12561525/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/app.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Some of the best speed skaters in the world were at Mennen Arena this week.", "title": "Chinese Olympians teach speed skating in Morris Twp", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/194e90be92ffa7897c9c610cf421575afebc8f8d/c=160-0-1120-960&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/AsburyPark/2014/07/12/photo4.jpg", "creator": "@AsburyParkPress", "site": "@AsburyParkPress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600068887", "fb": {"app_id": 116172675120111}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": ""}, "article_summary": "Buy Photo Chinese gold medal-winning Olympians Sun Linlin and Meng Wang have fun with their speed skaters at camp.\n\u201cShe is like the Michael Phelps of speed skating,\u201d Liu said.\n\u201cWe want to emphasize international speed skating here in Morris County.\n\u201cI want Chinese skaters to learn the culture, and everyone to learn from each other and make friends,\u201d Sun said.\n\u201cLinlin can offer tremendous support to local speed skaters,\u201d Liu said."}
