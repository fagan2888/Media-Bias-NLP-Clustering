Over half of the largest Affordable Health Reform co-ops have failed spreading panic in the White House. To make matters worse, a prominent doctor compares the American health system to a disastrous plan crash.\n\nEach day passengers aboard aircraft fly confidently knowing there is a certified and licensed professional pilot at the controls in the cockpit. But what if the government required two separate and autonomous pilots to work the controls simultaneously?\n\n\u201cThe consequences, within minutes, would be disastrous,\u201d states John P. Tedeschi, a licensed pilot in Robbinsville, NJ acknowledged yesterday. \u201cUnfortunately, with constant interference from the government and insurance companies, that is exactly what is happening to doctors \u2013 every hour of every day.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe ability to fly a plane is the result of the wisdom of aerodynamics and mechanics,\u201d Tedeschi explains. \u201cThe pilot must have a comfortable and working relationship with his machine before he can operate it precisely and safely. There cannot be two captains on the flight deck. The pilot makes sure the equipment is properly maintained and that there is enough fuel for the trip. If the owner of the plane wants to save money, however, common sense dictates he cannot expect to have the same outcome using less fuel and less maintenance.\u201d\n\nNot only is Tedeschi a pilot, he is also a physician and has been practicing medicine for over thirty years. With the wisdom of both the pilot and doctor, he cautions that the government is treating passengers far better than American patients seeking medical care.\n\n\u201cThe doctor, a certified and licensed professional, is second-guessed every step of the way and is told how to practice medicine,\u201d Dr. Tedeschi explained. And they are being forced to provide care \u201cnot based on individual patients or their issues; rather, based on \u2018how much it costs,\u2019 and whether such a treatment or procedure is \u2018really needed\u2019 determined by computer-generated algorithms, not by the individual's condition.\u201d\n\nDr. Tedeschi, a renowned, knowledgeable and honest critic of Obamacare, aims his truths straight at insurance companies.\n\n\u201cThey are directing physicians on what is \u2013 or is not \u2013 appropriate treatment. It's all about money. Not safety. Not healthcare. Money,\u201d the doctor stresses. \u201cWhat if these same companies entered the cockpit and began to change the flight's \u2018checklist\u2019 in order to save time and money? Or employed unqualified or incompetent people in the passenger compartment to outline the safety features of the aircraft and what to do in an emergency? It wouldn't be long before disaster struck.\u201d\n\n\u201cSadly, it's not a \u2018what if\u2019 scenario anymore,\u201d charges Dr. Tedeschi. \u201cIt is happening now in medicine. Physicians cannot be second-guessed or directed to perform their craft by individuals and forces with less experience.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany times, when flying an aircraft, an unexpected complication arises,\u201d he elaborates. \u201cThe pilot may contact Air Traffic Control and request a change in flight plans. The pilot, however, remains in control; still in charge.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe controllers' main response and obligation is to assist the pilot with whatever is needed \u2013 not to distract the pilot from the problem at hand, but to assist in the main mission of flying the airplane. The first thing a pilot is taught in learning to fly is \u2018first fly the plane,\u2019 and then solve the problem.\u201d\n\nBut with Obamacare, \u201cphysicians, on the other hand, are repeatedly interrupted and challenged with every decision they make on behalf of the well-being of the patient. They are misdirected and ordered to adhere to \u2018flow sheets\u2019 that have absolutely nothing to do with the safety or care of the patient,\u201d Tedeschi points out. \u201cMedical decisions today are dollar-driven. And that is contrary to the oath that all doctors take.\u201d\n\nDr. Tedeschi illustrates the failures in the American healthcare system by considering that when a pilot declares an in-flight emergency, \u201cAir Traffic Controllers hear the Mayday \u2013 but instead of reacting immediately to help solve the problem, they first demand that the pilot fill out several forms, explaining the emergency, how it happened, why it happened, what they need in order to correct the problem and, then, depending on how much it will cost, controllers respond, \u2018Flight 123, please hold your position while we secure approval for your request.\u2019\"\n\nIf American health is intended to be improved, why do the latest Gallup polls now indicate that about one-third of all citizens are putting off medical treatment because of costs? In 2001, only 19% delayed care because of money.\n\nIn October, physicians, nurses and medical staff were bombarded in October with what one doctor termed \u201cone of the biggest Obamacare blunders toward government controlled medicine.\u201d Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, a new system called \u201cICD-10,\u201d made the 14,600 codes used for diagnostic and procedural codes inflated to about 70,000 overnight.\n\nPhysicians and analysts who have used ICD-10 indicate the system is far more complex, extremely detailed and is burdensome. Various estimates reveal that tax payers are paying $5.5 billion to $13.5 to implement ICD-10 nationwide. Experts reveal the suggested benefits from this bureaucratic monster will only be $.7 billion to $7.7 billion for the next decade. This new coding mandate, along with Electronic Health Records (EHRs), have changed the medical profession for the worse according to many critics.\n\n\u201cThe obligation and responsibility of the physician, to present to the third party payer, is like a pilot asking to be cleared for take-off after a complete flight check was satisfactorily performed,\u201d explains Tedeschi. \u201cAnd then being told by the control tower that the manner in which the flight check was performed needs to be presented in a \u2018different language,\u2019 no longer verbally, but written in a format that changes year to year -- or the flight is cancelled.\u201d\n\nHe equates the Obamacare \u201cControl Tower\u201d as \u201cbeing operated by lawyers, businessmen and politicians\u201d with the EHR requirements being like \u201cpilots having to document, in writing, every move they make on the flight deck \u2013every switch they throw, every button they push, every instinctive move they make. And if they don't \u2013 even if the plane took off and landed safely \u2013 they would be financially punished by the \u2018Form and Document Police\u2019 for not following the rules.\u201d\n\nTedeschi observes that pilots, by their training, nature and protocols, do a \u201cwalk around\u201d and then cockpit check for aircraft safety prior to each flight. After starting the aircraft, \u201cRPM's are increased, a run-up is performed, the transponder is set, the pilot marks a course and makes a flight plan with full concentration, and finally radios the control tower for clearance to taxi.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe tower responds, \u2018Sorry, Flight 123, we can't just take your word for it that you did the flight preparation, you need to put it \u2013 plus all your thoughts \u2013 in writing, before you can push back from the gate,\u2019\" Tedeschi continues. \u201cHave I not done this hundreds of times and logged thousands of hours in the air? Do I not know what I'm doing? You need this in writing? For EACH flight?\"\n\n\"Finally, after all of the bureaucratic requirements are fulfilled \u2013 and you're at a cruising altitude about to settle back and enjoy the flight \u2013 a message comes in demanding you put the plane on auto-pilot and fill out a form that asks questions about 27 previous flights,\u201d Tedeschi cites. \u201cAnd failure to do so, quickly, will result in your loss of a pilots' license and be forced to land at the nearest airport.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the world of medical audits,\u201d Tedeschi offers. \u201cDoctors are bombarded daily with ongoing demands to justify previous medical decisions, all under the threats of loss of license to practice medicine, withholding payments and possibly being charged with fraud.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe instructions are for immediate compliance \u2013 to drop everything at the moment, despite the number of people in the waiting room \u2013 in order to fill out the forms,\u201d he continues. \u201cAnd patients wonder why the doctor is late \u2013 or spends most of the time entering data into a laptop \u2013 rather than concentrating on their well-being.\u201d\n\n\"Control medicine \u2013 and you control the population,\u201d Dr. Tedeschi emphasizes. \u201cWelcome to the world of medicine.
