The investment builds on the $6 million given to Florida health centers in September. The funding stems from the Affordable Care Act.\n\nA main tenant of the health law was not only to get more people insured but to offer them preventive services and connect them with primary care doctors so they don\u2019t wind up in emergency rooms when they are sicker and more expensive to treat.\n\nNationally, the Obama administration says the law has funded health centers and helped them add 6 million patients.\n\n(TM and \u00a9 Copyright 2016 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.
