Rick Snyder vetoed an anti-abortion law, but lawmakers are taking it up again. Mich. bans abortions in ACA plans\n\nMichigan became the 24th state to ban most abortions in its exchange plans when the state legislature passed a bill Wednesday afternoon by sizable margins.\n\nThe action follows an an unusual citizens\u2019 petition drive that allows state lawmakers to resurrect a bill the governor had vetoed and vote it into law without his signature. The ban goes into effect 90 days from Friday.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nFederal law prohibits taxpayer-financed abortion, and that was addressed in the compromise that paved the way for final passage of President Barack Obama\u2019s health law. But the Affordable Care Act also allows states to ban abortion coverage in the exchanges \u2014 even if the state isn\u2019t running its own exchange \u2014 and most of the GOP-led states have done so.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Full health care policy coverage)\n\nTwenty-one states have laws banning exchange plans from covering abortion in most cases. Two other states already had restrictions in place that applied to all private health plans, which now include those offered on the exchange. The abortion funding controversy arises in the exchanges because many people will get federal subsidies to buy the health plans.\n\nGov. Rick Snyder, a Republican, vetoed the Michigan provision when it first in late 2012. Anti-abortion activists collected more than 315,000 signatures to allow the legislature to take it up again, and now it becomes law without Snyder\u2019s signature, under a provision in the state constitution.\n\n\u201cThe citizens asked for the Governor\u2019s veto to be overturned,\u201d said state Sen. Rick Jones, a Republican who voted for the provision. \u201cToday that happened.\u201d\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Polls show most disapprove of Obamacare)\n\nThe sweep of the bans across the country is hardly surprising considering that states have passed record numbers of abortion restrictions in recent years.\n\nMany activists who oppose federal funding of abortion were unhappy with the health law compromise, under which exchange plans can cover abortion but insurers are required to keep the funding streams separate. If a woman wants abortion coverage, she must pay a separate premium, with no federal subsidies.\n\nThat concession was enough to convince some anti-abortion Democrats, notably then-Rep. Bart Stupak of Michigan, to lend crucially needed votes to pass the health care law. But the law also allows states to directly ban abortion coverage, something anti-abortion activists point to as evidence that lawmakers knew it didn\u2019t go far enough in making sure federal funds aren\u2019t used to pay for abortions.\n\nThe Michigan measure bans abortion coverage in plans both on and off the exchanges except when the mother\u2019s life is at risk. Six other state bans include only a life-of-the-mother exception, while 14 states also include the federal Hyde Amendment exceptions in cases of rape or incest, according to an analysis by the Guttmacher Institute.\n\nPHOTOS: 12 Democrats criticizing the Obamacare rollout)\n\nA handful of the laws also allow abortion coverage in the exchanges if the mother\u2019s long-term health is at risk or if there are severe fetal defects. A few\u2014including Louisiana and Tennessee\u2014ban it altogether, no exceptions.\n\nThe flood of bans has frustrated abortion rights activists, who say the Affordable Care Act does enough to ensure federally funds aren\u2019t use for abortion. The American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit over Kansas\u2019 ban, but it was dismissed last year by a federal judge.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a nationwide, orchestrated attempt to restrict access to reproductive health care in many different ways,\u201d said Elissa Berger, policy council for the ACLU. \u201cIt\u2019s part of this nationwide effort that I think has surprised and angered a lot of people. Some politicians are laser-focused on pushing these measures.\u201d\n\nBut anti-abortion activists say state lawmakers are just ensuring that abortion restrictions apply equally to all federally-subsidized insurance plans. Thirty-two states and the District of Columbia prohibit abortion funding in their Medicaid programs, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\n( WATCH: Obamacare timeline)\n\n\u201cThose states view it as aligning their policies for the poor with their participation in other kinds of tax benefits with respect to abortion coverage,\u201d said Chuck Donovan, president of the Susan B. Anthony List Education Fund.\n\nNatalie Villacorta contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "After an unusual citizens' petition drive, the state becomes the 24th to implement a ban.", "title": "Mich. bans abortions in ACA plans", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2013/12/michigan-obamacare-affordable-care-act-abortions-100985.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2013/06/16/130614_rick_snyder_ap_605.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Affordable Care Act (620),Abortion (477),Obamacare (1165),Abortion Rights (50),Rick Snyder (56),Michigan (371)", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "After an unusual citizens' petition drive, the state becomes the 24th to implement a ban.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9e55\"", "article_summary": "Mich. bans abortions in ACA plansMichigan became the 24th state to ban most abortions in its exchange plans when the state legislature passed a bill Wednesday afternoon by sizable margins.\nThe Michigan measure bans abortion coverage in plans both on and off the exchanges except when the mother\u2019s life is at risk.\n( Also on POLITICO: Full health care policy coverage)Twenty-one states have laws banning exchange plans from covering abortion in most cases.\nThe abortion funding controversy arises in the exchanges because many people will get federal subsidies to buy the health plans.\nThat concession was enough to convince some anti-abortion Democrats, notably then-Rep.
