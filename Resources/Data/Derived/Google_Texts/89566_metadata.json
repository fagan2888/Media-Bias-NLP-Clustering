Alternatively upgrade to a modern browser.\n\nJust days after Hillary Clinton launched her 2016 presidential campaign via online video \u2013 Everyday Americans want a champion, and I want to be that champion \u2013 some not-so-everyday Americans kicked off their own campaign in similar style.\n\nHookers for Hillary was the brainchild of brothel owner Dennis Hof and the working girls at the Moonlite Bunny Ranch, and it marked a hard left turn after Pimpin\u2019 for Paul, the group\u2019s 2008 and 2012 efforts to propel libertarian Ron Paul into the White House.\n\nIt is hard to argue with the attention-getting power of sex workers in stilettos, plunging red-white-and-blue necklines, noms d\u2019amour such as Entice Love, Air Force Amy and Caressa Kisses. But behind Hof\u2019s publicity stunt turned political action is a sobering reality.\n\nThe women who ply their trade in Hof\u2019s legal brothels know first hand the deep scars that crisscross the American landscape. Until recently, many were uninsured. Others say prostitution allowed them to escape the paycheck-to-paycheck life of the working poor. Some are survivors of violence, incest, addiction.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m for Hillary because she\u2019s cracking down on domestic violence,\u201d said Entice Love, a 26-year-old mother of two from Sacramento. \u201cI\u2019ve been in a relationship for a long time where I\u2019d been thrown down stairs, black eyes, fractured ribs \u2026 When I\u2019m looking at who I want to pick for the presidency, I look at what are they doing that I can relate to that will be of benefit for me. That\u2019s why I was for Obama, now I\u2019m for Hillary.\u201d\n\nHof, who owns the Bunny Ranch and six other legal brothels in Nevada, is blunt about the kinds of things that help an age-old business under pressure from high-tech rivals: Pimpin\u2019 for Paul. Hookers for Hillary. A memoir from the self-proclaimed PT Barnum of Booty called The Art of the Pimp: A Love Story. And the exploits of Lamar Odom, the NBA star found unconscious in October at a Hof hotspot in southern Nevada.\n\n\u201cIt was terrible for him,\u201d the stocky star of the HBO reality show Cathouse said, \u201cbut it put me on media worldwide. It happened nine-and-a-half months into the year, but it was still the No 1 Google-searched item of the year. Even more than Caitlyn Jenner.\u201d\n\nPolitics, Hof says, have been just as beneficial for the Moonlite Bunny Ranch.\n\nHollywood, 31, agrees. She has spent the past two years commuting between her Sacramento home and this rural brothel spread across 46 sagebrush-filled acres just outside Carson City.\n\nHookers for Hillary is \u201ca great way to get, not only the Bunny Ranch\u2019s name out there, but to get more support for Hillary \u2026 Hopefully maybe people who were not really [political] followers before kind of looked into it and went, \u2018Wow, this is big! What\u2019s going on?\u2019\n\n\u201cAnd perhaps,\u201d said the chatty registered Democrat in skin-tight lavender, \u201cthey researched Hillary a little more, and perhaps they researched us as well. So it was kind of beneficial on both sides.\u201d\n\nOn a Wednesday before the Nevada caucuses, the Bunny Ranch was quiet in the bright morning light. A stretch limousine gathered dust in the parking lot. The compound\u2019s main building looked like something out of an antebellum trailer park, flesh-tone clapboard siding, pink and white trim, white wrought-iron fencing and faux second-story balcony.\n\nInside, a Three Stooges episode played on the television above banquettes of plush red and black. There\u2019s a brass pole, a full bar, cases filled with sex toys, an ATM and a computer room for the working girls who don\u2019t have laptops.\n\nTaylor Lee, a 26-year-old from Houston, used to be a cake decorator before arriving at the brothel. It was hard work, she said, at low pay. She also waited tables, but her wages could barely keep up with the epilepsy medication that keeps her seizures at bay.\n\n\u201cBeing a server, helping out my family, and my epilepsy medication, which I had to have, was $10 a pill,\u201d Lee said. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot for a 20-year-old to pay. I have seizures in my sleep. If I don\u2019t take my medicine for one night, I will begin a seizure. And that\u2019s a lot of recovery time. I sleep for a day or two afterwards and feel bad.\u201d\n\nLee is sitting on a zebra-striped bench in one of the ranch\u2019s six VIP rooms. She is slender and tan, with stick-straight blond hair and a cobalt blue dress that struggles to contain her. She has been at the ranch for six months and registered to vote when she got her medical marijuana card.\n\nPolitics, she says, is her favorite subject. She is a deep believer in Obamacare and its ability to change lives by allowing people with pre-existing conditions to be covered by health insurance. She plans to vote in favor of legalizing recreational marijuana when it\u2019s on the ballot this November.\n\nLee said she feels a little pushed to support Clinton \u2013 but not so much that she will change the way she plans to caucus later this month.\n\n\u201cI do think the Hookers for Hillary campaign is huge here,\u201d Lee said. \u201cI was told today that this interview was going to be about my support for Hillary, which is amazing. I think she would be an excellent candidate \u2026 But I will be caucusing for Bernie Sanders.\u201d\n\nEntice Love, who is more enthusiastic about Clinton than Lee is, is equally interested in the political process. She remembers sitting with her family in the living room in 2009 and watching Beyonc\u00e9 serenade Barack and Michelle Obama at the inaugural ball with the Etta James standard At Last.\n\nAnd she knows income inequality \u2013 a major campaign issue for Sanders and Obama \u2013 first hand.\n\n\u201cBefore coming to the Bunny Ranch I\u2019ve always had a regular job but my job was never enough to make complete ends meet for me and my children,\u201d said the former retail worker. \u201cSo I have always been on welfare, public assistance, and I had Medical. I\u2019m no longer on Medical. I have Kaiser. I have private Kaiser that I just pay.\u201d\n\nTall, willowy and scantily clad, Love counts off the months on her fingers: September, October, November, December, January, February, the time she has worked as a prostitute.\n\nTo anyone who would tell her that her career is degrading, she\u2019ll tell them what she found really degrading \u2013 having a man in her pre-Bunny Ranch life offer to buy her a $200 dinner when what she really wanted was a $200 trip to the grocery store so she could feed her kids.\n\nToday, she says, she can buy gifts for her family. She can pay for health insurance. And she can support her candidate of choice.\n\n\u201cDennis talks about it, \u2018We\u2019re doing the voting for Hillary.\u2019 But I already had it in my mind that I\u2019m going to vote for her, so I\u2019m all for it,\u201d Love said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re helping Hillary and we\u2019re helping ourselves.
