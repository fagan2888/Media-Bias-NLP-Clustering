Those athletes that have been caught have only been caught because of the tests at the London Marathon.\n\n\"The IAAF needs to do more to stop people from starting (races) that have blood values that are out of normal range.\"\n\nLast week, the Sunday Times and German broadcasters ARD said data, leaked by a whistlebower, showed that between 2001 and 2012 a third of Olympic and world championship endurance and middle distance running medals had been won by athletes who, at some point, had given a suspicious blood test.\n\nThe IAAF stripped Russian Liliya Shobukhova of her medals since 2009 last week, including three victories in the Chicago marathon and one in London.\n\nThe IAAF has defended its drugs testing procedures strongly and refutes suggestions of turning a blind eye to doping, says it is cooperating with the independent World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) in an investigation into the allegations.\n\n(Writing by Ian Chadband;
