It provides coverage for about eight million children in families that earn too much to qualify for Medicaid, the government health care program for the poor, but cannot afford private coverage.\n\nThe federal government gives matching funds to states to provide the coverage, but that funding is set to end in September 2015, on the assumption that most beneficiaries will be able to get subsidized private coverage through the insurance exchanges created under the health care law. The federal government pays most of the $13 billion annual cost for CHIP.\n\nBut advocacy groups are warning that exchange plans will prove unaffordable for many households with children, partly because a quirk in the law prevents families from getting subsidies if a parent is offered \u201caffordable\u201d coverage at work. The law considers premiums on employer-based plans unaffordable if they exceed 9.5 percent of household income, but in what has become known as the \u201cfamily glitch,\u201d that standard applies only to premium costs for individual plans \u2014 not to family plans.\n\nAnother concern is that families will face more out-of-pocket costs for exchange plans, and that such plans will offer a narrower set of benefits for children. A recent analysis by the Wakely Consulting Group found that many families would need to spend substantially more out of pocket to get the same care through an exchange plan that they get through CHIP.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSo far, only 6 percent of enrollees in the new exchanges are younger than 18, according to the Health Policy Center at the Urban Institute. Far more children are enrolled in Medicaid than either CHIP or the exchange plans, including many who became newly eligible for Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nSenator Jay Rockefeller, Democrat of West Virginia, and Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California, have introduced bills that would extend federal funding for the program through 2019. But the Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission, an advisory group, has recommended only a two-year extension, saying that would be long enough to address problems like the law\u2019s family glitch.\n\nCHIP has generally had strong bipartisan support, and at Tuesday\u2019s hearing, held by the Senate Finance Committee\u2019s subcommittee on health care, both Democrats and Republicans praised it. But Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a conservative economist and former head of the Congressional Budget Office, pointed out in testimony that the program \u201cnow resides in an insurance landscape that is very different than the one it was created in.\u201d\n\nFor this reason, he said that \u201ca straight reauthorization is not the best decision\u201d and that \u201credundancies in coverage should be considered when making funding decisions.\u201d\n\nMr. Holtz-Eakin added that Congress would have to come up with new resources to pay for an extension of the program, saying, \u201cThat\u2019s a problem.\u201d\n\nSenator Michael B. Enzi, Republican of Wyoming, suggested that CHIP at least needed to be whittled down, saying, \u201cWe need to focus our efforts here on identifying the core mission of the program.\u201d\n\nMr. Rockefeller, one of the original architects of the program, who is retiring at the end of this year, said he worried that even with broad support, the program could get caught up in a political fight.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t always count on something that has been bipartisan to continue to be bipartisan,\u201d he said during the hearing.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCathy Caldwell, the director of Alabama\u2019s Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, testified that her state was \u201calready dealing with issues related to the uncertainty of CHIP funding\u201d as it prepared a budget for the 2016 fiscal year.\n\n\u201cWe have families already getting stressed,\u201d she said. \u201cThey may find coverage through an employer plan or a marketplace plan, but it is my belief that many will not, and they will go back to being uninsured.\u201d\n\nRonald Pollack, the executive director of Families USA, a liberal-leaning consumer group, said that while he saw \u201cencouraging signs\u201d that the program\u2019s funding would be extended, he worried it could be thwarted by congressional gridlock.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very possible that it could get caught up in controversial matters extraneous to CHIP,\u201d Mr. Pollack said. \u201cIt\u2019s too soon to say.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140916211347,
