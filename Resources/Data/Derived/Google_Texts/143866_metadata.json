You spend your career teaching, nursing the elderly back to health, assisting the unemployed in their job search. After many years of working hard, playing by rules, supporting your children to get them through college, you retire. If you\u2019re lucky, your state offers a public pension that gives you a modest benefit of $18,000 a year in retirement. You know you can cover the basics, make ends meet, and be secure in your retirement. But then one day, it all changes. Your state decides to deal with its self-made pension problem by cutting benefits for retired public servants. What do you do now? At 67, do you take a job waiting tables to make up the loss? Move in with your kids?\n\nThis is the story millions of women around the country are suffering through, thanks to ill-conceived efforts to gut public pension systems.\n\nSince the start of the Great Recession, there have been battles over public pensions in dozens of states, with right-wing lawmakers and special interests looking to gut traditional pension plans that provide a stable benefit and replace them with risky, privatized accounts that are lucrative for banks, but offer little security for working people.\n\nThe issue has been analyzed from many angles, but little has been said about the outsize impact pension cuts have on women.\n\nRetirement insecurity is a startling piece of the vast economic inequality puzzle facing women today. Women are paid $0.78 on the dollar that men are paid for the same amount of work, resulting in decreased Social Security payments and retirement benefits. More women than men take time from their jobs to give birth, raise children and care for family members \u2013 leading to lower overall lifetime savings.\n\nThe result? The median retirement income for women in 2010 was just 59 percent that of men, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office. Complicating matters further is the fact that women live longer than men, are more likely to live alone in old age, and have higher medical costs. And so, older women are 4.5 percent more likely to be living in poverty than men. All the while, women account for 40 percent of breadwinners and are increasingly driving our economy forward.\n\nFor a long time, the public sector was where women could gain a foothold in the economy, support their families and earn a secure retirement. In 2011, women comprised 48.3 percent of overall employment, yet accounted for 59.5 percent of employment in state and local government. But due to well-orchestrated attacks on working families, the public sector is no longer a place where workers can devote a career of service to their state and community and in return retire with economic security.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Women are increasingly important players in the U.S. economy.
