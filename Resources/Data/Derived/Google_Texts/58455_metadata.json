In his new position, Longenecker is responsible for overseeing day-to-day operations of the entire senior living community, including dining, marketing, health services and activities. Longenecker brings nearly 20 years in senior living leadership to Oak Trace.\n\nBefore joining Oak Trace, Longenecker worked as the senior vice president of operations for three years at Christian Homes Inc., a senior living organization based in the Midwest. He also previously held senior leadership positions at Extendicare Health Services and Golden Living Senior Care.\n\n\u201cJust because residents are happy with where we are now, doesn\u2019t mean we should stop improving,\u201d Longenecker said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to continue upgrading our services across the board, since we want Oak Trace to be the best community it can be for all our residents and colleagues.\u201d\n\nLongenecker\u2019s first major project at Oak Trace was for the community\u2019s Health Center to join a Post-Acute Network and become an Accountable Care Organization (ACO). Because Oak Trace is a continuing care retirement community, residents who first live in independent living have priority access to on-site health care, if they ever need it. The ACO designation ensures residents would receive high-quality care on site, with the convenient option of not having to leave the community for preventive treatment and regular physician appointments. As an ACO, Oak Trace will also reduce rehospitalization rates, collaborate with local specialists and improve care standards.\n\n\u201cWith the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in place, it\u2019s very important for senior living communities to embrace ACOs,\u201d said Longenecker. \u201cNot only is it a fiscally responsible move, but it also provides residents higher-quality care, and that\u2019s a top priority for us at Oak Trace.\u201d\n\nAbout Oak Trace\n\nOak Trace, located at 200 Village Drive in Downers Grove, is a community that provides seniors a unique lifestyle experience and a variety of residential options, including maintenance-free independent living apartment homes, catered living, memory support, skilled nursing care and rehabilitation.
