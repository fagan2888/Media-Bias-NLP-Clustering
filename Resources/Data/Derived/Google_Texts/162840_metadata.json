It\u2019s ideological, and its roots go back some 2,400 years.\n\nThe truth is, if you really want to understand what\u2019s happening with Obama and ObamaCare, you need to start reading the ancient Greek philosopher Plato.\n\n\u201cIt is the business of the rulers of the city,\u201d Plato wrote in his \"Republic,\" \u201cto tell lies, deceiving both its enemies and its own citizens for the benefit of the city...\u201d\n\nIn fact, the wise ruler -- Plato\u2019s Philosopher King -- must be prepared to \u201cadminister a great many lies and falsehoods,\u201d Plato went on, for the benefit of the masses.\n\nThe Philosopher King knows that they are too ignorant to ever see the truth about their city\u2019s problems and how to fix them. Only he or she as part of a specially trained elite (in Plato\u2019s day, it was his Academy; today it\u2019s Harvard or Stanford or Yale) know how to do that and create a perfect social order. And at times it\u2019s only through telling what Plato called \u201ca noble lie\u201d that he or she can get the people\u2019s cooperation in achieving it.\n\nThat\u2019s what President Obama has been doing ever since took office.\n\n\u201cIf you like your plan, you can keep it,\u201d joins a host of other Noble Lies emanating from this White House, starting with the stimulus-that-wasn\u2019t and the \u201cred line\u201d on Syria, not to mention how the murders in Benghazi were caused by an on-line video.\n\nSo don\u2019t expect Obama to ever fully apologize for lying about ObamaCare, any more than his fellow liberals and self-appointed Philosopher Kings expect him to.\n\nIn their minds, deceiving the ignorant masses -- that\u2019s us -- in order to advance the greater good is an essential part of the political game.\n\nIndeed, the entire American liberal agenda has been built on similar Noble Lies and myths (second hand smoke is one; global warming is another) ever since Franklin Roosevelt blamed the Wall Street Crash for the Great Depression.\n\nAnd every lie is planted for a single end: to justify increasing the power of the federal government, and with it the clout of its Number One champion, the Democrat Party.\n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s important to remember that it wasn\u2019t just Obama who told the Noble Lie about ObamaCare, it was the entire Democratic party.\n\nEvery member of Congress who voted for the Affordable Care Act knew its provisions would be a disaster for ten of millions of Americans already holding health insurance policies.\n\nThey knew the idea that people would be allowed to keep their existing policies was a fiction, just as they knew that far from making health care \u201caffordable\u201d ObamaCare would send insurance premiums skyrocketing -- an average of 43 percent around the country.\n\nAbove all, they knew their president had deceived the American public into accepting this financial and moral disaster, in order to clear the way for a single payer, completely government-run health system -- the Holy Grail of liberal social policy in which every aspect of our bodies and our daily lives, comes under the control of our Philosopher Rulers.\n\nThe shame is this is precisely a way of thinking about governor and governed the Founding Fathers rejected.\n\nThomas Jefferson once confessed to John Adams that he had been rereading Plato\u2019s \"Republic\" and \u201claid it down often to ask myself how it could have been that the world should have so long consented to give reputation to such nonsense as this,\u201d including the notion of the Noble Lie.\n\nThey knew rulers, no matter how well-educated or experienced, actually have no superior knowledge to ordinary people, because they all understand and judge reality at the same level.\n\nThat\u2019s why Noble Lies aren\u2019t just wrong. They also don\u2019t work very long because citizens can see what\u2019s real and true just as clearly as any of Plato\u2019s Philosopher Kings, and sooner or later will catch them out.\n\nNow they\u2019ve caught out ObamaCare. This Noble Lie has been blown; and the Obama presidency -- and liberalism\u2019s would be Philosopher Kings -- won\u2019t look the same again.\n\nHistorian Arthur Herman is a senior fellow at the Hudson Institutein Washington, D.C.
