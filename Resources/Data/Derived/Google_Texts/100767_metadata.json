Her name is Julie Burros and she hails from Chicago, a city famous for embracing and supporting the arts (like \u201cCloud Gate\u201d in the above photo).\n\nBurros quickly earned the nickname \u201carts czar\u201d after Boston Mayor Marty Walsh fulfilled his campaign promise by appointing her to the newly created cabinet-level position this past September.\n\nNow that she\u2019s here, Boston artists from all genres and cultural institutions, large and small, are clamoring for the chief\u2019s attention.\n\nHigh Hopes\n\nAt the Susie Smith Gallery, in Dorchester\u2019s Four Corners neighborhood, a steady stream of African-American artists came in out of the cold for an opening last week, but the big draw was an introduction to Burros.\n\nBoston\u2019s first chief of arts and culture in 20 years surprised them by responding \u2018yes\u2019 to their email invitation. Now they were excitedly chatting and nibbling on a beautiful spread of food, waiting for Burros to arrive.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s wonderful that she has the time to be able to come out to the community and see what\u2019s happening in our community,\u201d doll and jewelry artist Susie Smith, who owns the three-month-old space, said.\n\nPainter Laurence Pierce agreed.\n\n\u201cI have the African Winter Gallery \u2014 it\u2019s about a seven-minute walk from here. It\u2019s a basement gallery,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to be put on the map. You know, we want her to know that there\u2019s a whole cadre of very talented artists just in this immediate area.\u201d\n\nInternationally known painter Paul Goodnight has been working in Boston for 30 years and admitted he\u2019s thrilled someone from City Hall is paying attention to their off-the-beaten-path enclave.\n\n\u201cThis will be the litmus test,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I\u2019m glad she\u2019s doing this because I don\u2019t know of anyone else who has done that.\u201d\n\nWearing denim overalls splattered with paint, Goodnight said he and his peers want the new \u201carts czar\u201d to champion artists of color and include them in Boston\u2019s cultural economy.\n\n\u201cUnderstanding that historically the black arts \u2014 our culture \u2014 has to be represented in this city, somewhere,\u201d he said.\n\nThe cameras clicked and the energy picked up when Burros walked through the door to meet the group. The 50-year-old, seasoned urban and cultural planner shook hands and commented on the work on display. One artist told her the group is made up of \u201cO.G.\u201d artists \u2014 not for \u201cOriginal Gangsters,\u201d they joke, but rather for \u201cOld Guys.\u201d\n\nPierce and a few others offered prepared remarks, welcoming Burros. Then they took turns asking questions about how she can help expose their art to more people. They also want to create a mentoring program for the next generation of artists in Dorchester, Mattapan and Roxbury.\n\nThis was one of the many stops Burros will make in the coming weeks. She\u2019s in reconnaissance mode, touring Boston to connect with as many artists as she can.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a public servant, and so I work for them,\u201d she explained, \u201cand I can only do a good job if I can really take in and understand and then reflect their needs to my colleagues in City Hall.\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019ll be a lot for Burros to absorb because it seems like every artist in Boston wants a piece of her. Street artist Cedric Douglas of Dorchester is one of them.\n\n\u201cChicago has amazing public art, it\u2019s crazy the innovation things they\u2019re doing there,\u201d he said recently on Beacon Hill, when Gov. Deval Patrick signed an executive order supporting a percent-for-art program to fund public art projects in Boston and other cities around the state. \u201cIf she could bring in some of that energy \u2014 and see how different organizations can work together \u2014 if she could orchestrate that with a magic wand, that\u2019d be awesome.\u201d\n\nManaging Expectations\n\nBoston Center for the Arts President Veronique Le Melle said it\u2019s not that easy.\n\n\u201cPeople are kind of saying, \u2018Well, we have this \u2018art czar,\u2019 and she\u2019s going to come in and save the world,\u2019 and it\u2019s not going to be that way,\u201d Le Melle said. \u201cSo that\u2019s going to be a challenge, to manage people\u2019s expectations about how long this process takes, if it\u2019s done correctly.\u201d\n\nLe Melle knows this from experience. Before coming to Boston she headed the state arts agency in Louisiana, pre- and post-Katrina. She was also the cultural director for the borough of Queens.\n\nLe Melle called Burros a \u201ctrue convener\u201d who she hopes can pull together Boston\u2019s complex cultural ecosystem.\n\n\u201cThat sounds great on paper. It\u2019s just really hard to do,\u201d said Pat Hollenbeck, president of the Boston Musicians\u2019 Union. \u201cThe arts groups \u2014 big and small \u2014 don\u2019t sit down and talk to each other. The thing is it makes sense: there\u2019s conflicting interests.\u201d\n\nBecause, Hollenbeck said, there\u2019s a limited amount of funding to go around.\n\nA significant part of Burros\u2019 job will be to figure out new support mechanisms to bolster the people who fuel the city\u2019s creative economy. She said she aims to identify existing resources that can be repurposed or redirected for use by Boston\u2019s arts community. An example she offered could be transforming unused spaces into multipurpose performance venues.\n\nOne of Hollenbeck\u2019s biggest concerns is Boston\u2019s lack of high-quality concert halls. He pointed to cities like Las Vegas and New York for successfully addressing that problem.\n\n\u201cHopefully what she\u2019ll be able to do is pound the pavement in search of the 21st century Andrew Carnegie who\u2019s going to be willing to support changing us in a most profound fashion,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout this we\u2019re really going to be a second-class arts city, sorry to say.\u201d\n\n\u201cBoston felt that it was a world class city in the 18th century, and so \u2018there\u2019s no thing to aspire towards,\u2019 \u201d said Anne Hawley, director of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum for 25 years. \u201cAnd I think now people are realizing that other cities are moving ahead of us.\u201d\n\nLike a lot of people in arts organizations big and small she\u2019s excited Walsh is making the arts a priority.\n\nOne of Burros\u2019 main tasks will be to create a \u201ccultural plan,\u201d which she did in Chicago. Hawley hopes Boston\u2019s plan will be more focused.\n\n\u201cSome cities have developed cultural plans that have been very potent and very powerful \u2014 others have developed plans that are so comprehensive it\u2019s hard to set priorities in them, and I\u2019m hoping that this planning will set a very few priorities that we can really address,\u201d she said.\n\nThere were a lot of good ideas, 243, in Chicago\u2019s plan. That\u2019s according to Michael Dorf, who is on a stewardship committee that was created after the Chicago plan was completed in 2012.\n\nDorf, an attorney and longtime cultural leader, says some factions felt like the city\u2019s plan needed to be activated and monitored more aggressively.\n\nThis month the mayor of Chicago and the public schools committed $10 million for arts education, which was a priority in the cultural plan Burros helped design.\n\n\u201cJulie definitely understands the field \u2014 she also really gets the political nature of a cultural plan and how important it is to make sure that it\u2019s the people of the city who realize that they are writing the plan as well as it being written by the city government,\u201d Dorf said.\n\nSome groundwork has already been laid. Kathy Bitetti, co-founder of the Massachusetts Artists Leaders Coalition (MALC), is an artist herself and self-described \u201cpolicy-nerd.\u201d She\u2019s been straddling art and policy on Beacon Hill for 20 years and helped create Walsh\u2019s arts and culture platform. Bitetti was also on the committee that selected Burros.\n\n\u201cHer biggest challenge is having a website that doesn\u2019t suck,\u201d Bitetti said.\n\nBecause Bitetti says artists should be able to rely on the city of Boston\u2019s website to find information about things like permitting and health care.\n\nGary Steuer, former chief cultural officer for the city of Philadelphia, agrees.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great to do big picture things and cultural plans and all that, great, but there is also a huge value to being the go-to place within city government for the arts and for artists,\u201d Steuer said.\n\nTo that end Burros shared her email address with the 600 people from Boston\u2019s arts community who attended a big welcome event at the Paramount Theatre last week. She\u2019s well aware that she has her work cut out for her.\n\n\u201cRight now I\u2019m just super-duper caffeinated and charged up so, occasionally I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh my God, what did I get myself into?\u2019 You know?\u201d she laughed.\n\nBut luckily Burros says those moments have been fleeting.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics", "description": "The city of Boston\u2019s new chief of arts and culture has been making the rounds during her first full week on the job.
