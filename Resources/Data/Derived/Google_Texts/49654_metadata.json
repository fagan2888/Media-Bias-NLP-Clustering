But according to Navy Secretary Ray Mabus, it has one truly distinguishing feature: It\u2019s probably the last manned fighter aircraft the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps will ever buy.\n\nIn remarks made at a conference held just outside Washington, D.C. on Wednesday, according to U.S. Naval Institute News, Mabus said, \u201cAs good as it is, and as much as we need it and look forward to having it in the fleet for many years, the F-35 should be, and almost certainly will be, the last manned strike fighter aircraft the Department of the Navy will ever buy or fly.\u201d\n\nRelated: General Defends $850 Billion F-35 Program\n\nMabus indicated the military is increasingly moving toward drones. \u201cUnmanned systems, particularly autonomous ones, have to be the new normal in ever-increasing areas,\u201d Mabus said.\n\nThe disappointing F-35 has cost the federal government some $400 billion to date \u2013 about $170 billion more than was forecast. It has failed to meet multiple performance standards specified by the different branches of the U.S. military. A highly critical report from the Department of Defense\u2019s Director of Operational Test and Evaluation last month included a laundry list of problems, including engine fires and computer malfunctions.\n\nThe delayed deployment of the F-35 has left the 187 F-22s currently in the U.S. military\u2019s inventory as the only currently available fifth generation jet fighters in the world.\n\nThe F-22 provides the U.S. military with air superiority over practically every other fighter plane on the planet. However, the F-22, itself a problematic piece of equipment that Congress stopped funding in 2009, is operationally inferior to the Russian T-50, which is reportedly going into regular production as soon as next year.\n\nRelated: With the F-35 Grounded, Putin\u2019s New Jet Beats Us Hands-Down\n\nIf Mabus is correct, and the move away from manned combat aircraft is imminent, the effect on the military contracting industry will likely be enormous. The U.S. has spent more on the F-35 alone than the entire GDP of all but about 30 countries in the world.\n\nDrone production will undoubtedly take up a lot of the slack. However, without the necessity of carrying and protecting a human pilot, drones will be cheaper to produce and, at least potentially, less profitable for the companies that produce aircraft for the U.S. military.\n\nMabus had at least a little good news for the defense industry on Wednesday. The Navy, he said, is creating a new senior position for an official who will be in charge of coordinating its unmanned combat capabilities.\n\nNo word on how much money the new department will have to spend.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter may have problems, but according to Navy Secretary Ray Mabus, it\u2019s probably the last manned fighter aircraft the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps will ever buy.", "title": "The F-35 May Be the Last Manned Fighter Plane the U.S. Ever Flies", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/16/F-35-May-Be-Last-Manned-Fighter-Plane-US-Ever-Flies", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02222013_F-35_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/16/F-35-May-Be-Last-Manned-Fighter-Plane-US-Ever-Flies", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02222013_F-35_article.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter may have problems, but according to Navy Secretary Ray Mabus, it\u2019s probably the last manned fighter aircraft the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps will ever buy.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "But according to Navy Secretary Ray Mabus, it has one truly distinguishing feature: It\u2019s probably the last manned fighter aircraft the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps will ever buy.\nThe F-35 Joint Strike Fighter may be ridiculously expensive, horribly late, and perhaps not all it was cracked up to be.\nThe F-22 provides the U.S. military with air superiority over practically every other fighter plane on the planet.\nThe disappointing F-35 has cost the federal government some $400 billion to date \u2013 about $170 billion more than was forecast.\nThe U.S. has spent more on the F-35 alone than the entire GDP of all but about 30 countries in the world."}
