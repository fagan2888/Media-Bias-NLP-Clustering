A few routes remain open for those who missed the health care law\u2019s big enrollment deadline.\n\nMillions may be eligible for a second chance to sign up for subsidized insurance this year. And people who get coverage after the deadline can still avoid, or at least reduce, the fine for going uninsured.\n\nAdditional Photos Applicants wait to be called during a health care enrollment event at the Bay Area Rescue Mission in Richmond, Calif., on Monday. A few routes remain open for those who missed the health care law\u2019s big enrollment deadline.

TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE GRACE PERIOD\n\nThis special break was created for anyone who began enrolling in an insurance marketplace by Monday\u2019s deadline but didn\u2019t finish. That includes people stymied by website outages or overwhelmed phone lines, missing information on applications, and other problems or confusion.\n\nThose who started an application on HealthCare.gov by March 31 should log on and finish it as soon as possible. Federal officials say they will take what time is necessary to work through cases pending.\n\nPeople applying online will have until April 15 to finish, administration spokesman Aaron Albright said Tuesday. Paper applications will be accepted until April 7.\n\nConsumers will have to attest that they had tried to enroll by March 31.\n\nRules vary in the 14 states running their own insurance marketplaces.\n\nFor most people, going through a marketplace opens the door to lower costs. Those who use the grace period will get coverage starting May 1 and won\u2019t owe a fine.\n\n2. USE A SPECIAL ENROLLMENT PERIOD\n\nThe government also is offering special extensions for a host of problems that might have prevented people from signing up through a marketplace: Natural disasters. Domestic abuse. A serious illness. Mistakes by application counselors. Errors by insurance companies.\n\nTo seek a \u201cspecial enrollment period,\u201d contact the federal call center, at 1-800-318-2596, or your state marketplace and explain what went wrong. It\u2019s on the honor system. If the extension is approved, that brings another 60 days to enroll.\n\nAlso, at any time during the year, certain life events \u2014 such as changing jobs, getting married or divorced, or becoming a parent \u2014 open a 60-day window to sign up for marketplace coverage.\n\n3. SIGN UP FOR MEDICAID\n\nThose who qualify can still enroll in Medicaid \u2014 there\u2019s no deadline. Eligibility is based on income and varies from state to state. About half the states expanded their Medicaid programs. The main beneficiaries of the change are adults earning up to about $16,100 per year, with no children living at home. Previously, Medicaid was limited mostly to poor children and their parents and people with disabilities.\n\n4. BUY INSURANCE OUTSIDE THE MARKETPLACES\n\nBuyers can always go directly to an insurance company, but it may be expensive. Plans bought outside the marketplaces don\u2019t come with government subsidies that hold down the cost for people with low or mid-level incomes. But they do include the law\u2019s consumer protections. For example, insurers can\u2019t turn down customers because of pre-existing medical conditions.\n\nEven after the deadline, buying a plan that meets the law\u2019s essential coverage standard reduces the penalty owed, which is based on the number of months without coverage.\n\nThe fine for going uninsured all year is the greater of two formulas: about 1 percent of household income above the tax-filing threshold of $10,150 or $95 per adult and $47.50 per child under 18, up to $285 per family. It\u2019s due to the IRS in April 2015.\n\n5. GET READY FOR NEXT TIME\n\nOpen enrollment for 2015 is coming later this year. It\u2019s scheduled to begin Nov. 15 and run just three months. That\u2019s another chance to get covered or switch into a plan with subsidies.\n\nSupporters of the law are calling on President Barack Obama to make things easier next time around.\n\nThe advocacy group Families USA suggested a bunch of improvements Tuesday, including more face-to-face sign-ups, coordinating enrollment with tax-filing season so people better understand the fines, and improving coordination with Medicaid programs.\n\nSomething to think about: The uninsured penalty next year rises to 2 percent of income or $325 per adult and $162.50 per child.", "article_metadata": {"description": "There are several avenues to pursue \u2013 and there\u2019s always next year.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "description": "There are several avenues to pursue \u2013 and there\u2019s always next year.", "title": "Obamacare coverage still available for those who missed deadline - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 999, "identifier": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/20140402_775714.xml-Health+Overhaul+Not+Too+Late.jpg", "height": 665}, "url": "http://www.pressherald.com/2014/04/01/obamacare_coverage_still_available_for_those_who_missed_deadline/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "There are several avenues to pursue \u2013 and there\u2019s always next year.", "creator": "@pressherald", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/20140402_775714.xml-Health+Overhaul+Not+Too+Late.jpg", "title": "Obamacare coverage still available for those who missed deadline - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "site": "@pressherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=951845858", "fb": {"admins": 769488179, "app_id": 178078215650057}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressherald", "section": "Nation & World", "published_time": "2014-04-01T18:00:11-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "QWs9pxQP8fwo2-nR5mWopc6qCK2D3920f7bl-U-zkso", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "A few routes remain open for those who missed the health care law\u2019s big enrollment deadline.\nThe Associated Press Related Headlines Feisty Obama says 7.1 million signed up for health coverage Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store \u2192Here are five options for those still without insurance:1.\nAnd people who get coverage after the deadline can still avoid, or at least reduce, the fine for going uninsured.\nEven after the deadline, buying a plan that meets the law\u2019s essential coverage standard reduces the penalty owed, which is based on the number of months without coverage.\nTAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE GRACE PERIODThis special break was created for anyone who began enrolling in an insurance marketplace by Monday\u2019s deadline but didn\u2019t finish."}
