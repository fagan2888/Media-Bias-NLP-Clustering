They tell lies about nullification - the one remedy our Framers actually advised when the feds usurp powers. They say our Constitution is the problem .They say it contains \u201cloopholes and vague phraseology\u201d which politicians exploit. They suggest the States are victims of federal tyranny; are the ones to \u201cfix\u201dour Constitution; and that the States call and control the convention. They say it is impossible for the convention to force a new Constitution down our throats. But I submit that is precisely what they intend to do.\n\nJordan Sillars, Communications Director for COS, let the cat out of the bag when he said:\n\n\u201c\u2026 3. I think the majority of Americans are too lazy to elect honest politicians. But I think some men and women could be found who are morally and intellectually capable of re-writing the Constitution\u2026\u201d [boldface mine].\n\nContrary to what the conspirators say, there is no way to stop the convention from \u201crunning away\u201d: All the delegates need do is come up with a new Constitution. It can provide for any method of ratification they want.\n\nThat is what happened in 1787 when the Continental Congress called a convention \u201cfor the sole and express purpose of revising the Articles of Confederation.\u201d [4] The delegates ignored their instructions and wrote an entirely new Constitution with its own new method of ratification.\n\nThe Conspirators\u2019 Campaign of Propaganda against The People\n\nThe conspirators\u2019 claims spit in the Face of Facts and Reality. So how have they been able to convince people tobelieve their claims; and go along with their destructive scheme?\n\nThey are exploiting the ignorance and desperation of The People by manipulating them with propaganda. Their FAQ\u2019s employ nine well known techniques of propaganda: [5]\n\n\u2022 Assume the Major Premise\n\n\u2022 Appeal to Desperation\n\n\u2022 Claim there is a Panacea\n\n\u2022 Repetition for Emphasis\n\n\u2022 The Big Lie\n\n\u2022 Fabricated Legal Principles & Precedent [\u201cImaginary Evidence\u201d]\n\n\u2022 Oversimplify\n\n\u2022 Exploit Wishful Thinking\n\n\u2022 The Self-sell.\n\nAssume the Major Premises\n\nThroughout the FAQs, it is assumed that:\n\n1. The purpose of amendments is to control the federal government;\n\n2. Our Constitution is defective;\n\n3. That there is such a thing as a \u201cconvention of states\u201d which States call and control;\n\n4. States will protect us from the federal government; and\n\n5. The federal government will obey amendments to the Constitution.\n\nThese are the five major assumptions upon which their scam is constructed. They don\u2019t prove them - they know many will blindly accept them. Only thoughtful people examine assumptions.\n\nBut you can become a \u201cthoughtful person\u201d if you will start examining what you are told.\n\nTheir first major premise : The Truth is two (2) delegates at the Federal Convention of 1787 (Mason & Randolph) wanted States to be able to amend the Constitution without involvement of Congress. The conspirators\u2019 crazy and dishonest claim that the purpose of amendments is to control the federal government is based on Mason\u2019s & Randolph\u2019s comments you can find here. Theirs was the minority view; Art. V provides for Congress\u2019 involvement in both methods of amendment; and Mason & Randolph objected so much to our Constitution they refused to sign it.\n\nOur Framers at the Federal Convention of 1787 understood that the purpose of amendments is to remedy defects in the Constitution [slavery]; and that the novelty and difficulty of what they were doing would require periodic revision [the 11th, 12th, & 27th amendments]. Hamilton said in Federalist No. 85 (13th para) that useful amendments would address the \u201corganization of the government, not \u2026 the mass of its powers\u201d. Madison said in Federalist No. 43 (at 8.) that\u201cuseful alterations will be suggested by experience.\u201d\n\nPeople are deceived by the conspirators\u2019 first premise because they don\u2019t understand that our Constitution created a federal government of strictly limited and defined\u2013 enumerated - powers. Everything the feds have authority to do is itemized in our Constitution. Does our Constitution delegate to the feds power to ban incandescent light bulbs, determine portion sizes of school lunches, and force us into obamacare? No! So what do you do when the feds usurp powers over such objects? Amend the Constitution? Really? How would you amend the Constitution to fix such usurpations? Make an Amendment saying the feds can\u2019t regulate light bulbs? And so on for every power they usurp?\n\nIt is crazy to say the purpose of amendments is to control the federal government. When the feds usurp powers not delegated, no amendment saying they can\u2019t do what they did will restrain them. They violated the Constitution when they usurped the power in the first place!\n\nFurthermore, the amendments they write don\u2019t restrict the feds: Michael Farris\u2019 \u201cparental rights amendment\u201d delegates power over children to the federal and state governments, and empowers judges to determine the extent of that power! One of Randy Barnett\u2019s amendments gives the feds lawful power over \u201charmful emissions\u201d [EPA now exercises usurped powers],and power \u201cto define and provide for punishment of offenses constituting acts of war or violent insurrection against the United States\u201d [read that again!]. Mark Levin\u2019s amendments also increase the powers of the feds by legalizing powers they have usurped. His \u201coverride\u201d amendments remove the Constitution as the standard of what is lawful and what is not, and substitute majority vote. Yet the conspirators say such amendments would curb the federal government!\n\nBut we must not be distracted by proposed amendments. Their amendments are most likely a pretext to get a \u201cconvention\u201d so they can carry out their plot to replace our Constitution.\n\nTheir second major premise : Our Constitution is the cause of our problems.\n\nExcept for some of the existing Amendments Americans already got manipulated into supporting, what is wrong with our Constitution? For the most part, it is easy to understand. For phrases federal judges have perverted - such as the \u201cinterstate commerce,\u201d \u201cgeneral welfare,\u201d & \u201cnecessary and proper\u201d clauses, a quick look into The Federalist Papers usually reveals the original intent. I illustrate that here and in many other papers.\n\nThis one page chart illustrates the structure of our federal system and the enumerated powers delegated to the federal government. What needs \u201cfixing\u201d? We are in our present mess because for 100 years, we elected & re-elected politicians to federal and state office who ignore it.\n\nAll our Constitution wants is (1) to be learned & obeyed; and (2) to have repealed some of the existing Amendments. Repeal those the same way we repealed the 18th Amendment. We don\u2019t need a \u201cconvention\u201d for that. Instead of sending ignorant phonies to Congress; send people who know the Constitution [make them pass tests before you support them] and commit to repealing the 17th Amendment and other ill-considered Amendments.\n\nTheir third major premise : That there is such a thing as a \u201cconvention of states\u201d: The FAQs say \u201cArticle V, Section 2 of the Constitution\u201d gives state legislatures the power to call a convention; that Federalist No. 85 says Congress has \u201cno control over the delegates\u201d; that \u201cVirginia called the Philadelphia Convention of 1787\u201d; and that \u201cBasic common sense\u201d and \u201cAgency law 101\u201d says \u201cEach state chooses its own delegates\u201d.\n\nThose claims are truly bizarre.\n\nRead Art. V: There is no \u201cSection 2\u201d. Article V says Congress calls the convention \u2013 not state legislatures. All state legislatures can do is apply to Congress for Congress to call it.\n\nFederalist No. 85 says Congress must call a convention when two-thirds of the States apply for it. Hamilton does not say Congress has \u201cno control over the delegates\u201d! [6]\n\nVirginia did not \u201ccall\u201d the Philadelphia Convention of 1787! The Continental Congress did. Their Resolution calling the 1787 convention, pursuant to Art. 13 of The Articles of Confederation, is quoted at endnote 4. And when the Continental Congress called the 1787 convention, they specifically provided that delegates would be appointed by the States.[4]\n\nBut Art. I, Sec. 8, last clause, of our Constitution delegates to Congress power to make all laws necessary and proper to carry out the powers vested in it by Art. V. So Congress has the power to organize the convention, appoint the chairman and delegates, etc. The Mason & Randolph view was rejected. And the clear words of our Constitution cannot be changed by some ignorant person\u2019s subjective conceptions of \u201ccommon sense\u201d and \u201cAgency law 101\u201d!\n\nTheir fourth major premise : That States are victims of federal tyranny and will rein in the federal government given the opportunity at a convention.\n\nBut look at what States have done. They have acquiesced in federal usurpations in exchange for federal funds. The States adopted unconstitutional federal education schemes such as \u201crace to the top\u201d and common core for the federal grant money.\n\nDHS is becoming America\u2019s equivalent of the East German STASI and Soviet KGB. With the connivance of State governments, DHS is taking over local & State law enforcement. And read about the fusion centers in every State \u2013 the States acquiesced!\n\nJohn Barnes shows that State governments no longer focus on managing \u201ca relatively self-contained polis\u201d, but on \u201csiphoning as much money as possible from the federal government\u201d; and that \u201cstate government is becoming a mere pass-through for federal funds and an apparatus of federal policy.\u201d Barnes shows us how State governments all over the Country are bloated with bureaucrats whose job is to \u201cmaximize federal funding\u201d.\n\nGoogle \u201cmaximize federal funding\u201d \u2013 you will see. No rational person can believe that the politicians in the States \u2013 who are the ones who sold us to the feds in the first place \u2013are the ones to rescue us from the feds. If the States wanted to, they could rein in the feds right now by using the remedy our Framers really did advise: Nullification.\n\nTheir fifth major premise : That the federal government will obey amendments.\n\nBut think! The feds continually violate the Constitution we have. They exercise thousands of usurped powers.\n\nThe conspirators insist the feds would obey future amendments because the feds haven\u2019t violated recent amendments, such as women\u2019s suffrage. Well, of course not! Of the 15 amendments ratified since the 12th in 1804; 10 increased the powers of the feds (13th, 14th, 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th, 19th, 23rd,24th, 26th); [7] and 4 were \u201chousekeeping\u201d amendments (20th, 22nd, 25th, 27th).\n\nDo you see?\n\nAppeal to Desperation\n\nThe gist of this propaganda technique is to argue that we must do something \u2013 we can\u2019t do nothing \u2013 so let\u2019s do what I propose. And we better do it \u201cbefore it is too late\u201d.\n\nMany Americans are in a panic over the rapidity with which Obama \u2013 with the connivance of the Republican and Democrat parties and the State governments\u2013 is setting up a national totalitarian police state.\n\nBut we mustn\u2019t allow the conspirators to exploit our desperation so as to induce us into surrendering our Constitution. All Americans who have fallen for the conspirators\u2019 scam have been manipulated by THIS technique.\n\nWe have effective options. We have failed to gain the knowledge which would enable us to be the Sovereigns we are supposed to be. We have contented ourselves with blind faith in talk show hosts, politicians, and other charlatans. We are what needs fixing.\n\nClaim there is a Panacea\n\nWith this, you claim that what you are offering is a magical cure for all the problems.\n\nThe conspirators say all we have to do to fix our problems is have a \u201cconvention of states\u201d. They say they will propose amendments to the Constitution, and the federal government will be \u201cfixed\u201d. They ignore the facts that everyone has ignored the Constitution we have; that it was the States who sold us out in the first place; and that We The People kept reelecting ignorant & glib politicians who violate the Constitution to state & federal office.\n\nThere is no such thing as a panacea. We have a long road ahead of us to fix the problems We caused by our own folly, ignorance, and laziness.\n\nRepetition for Emphasis\n\nWith this, you drive home a few simple and unproven points by repeating them over and over until the public believes them.\n\nThe five major premises listed above are repeated over & over & over & over & over. People believe them because they have been programed to believe them.\n\nOrange quotes Adolf Hitler:\n\n\u201cIt [propaganda] must repeat those points over and over again until the public believes it. The principles behind propaganda are the same principles of mind control, hypnotic suggestion, and mental programming: distraction and repetition. With propaganda, distraction draws attention away from information that is true and directs attention to information that is false. Repetition of the false information imbeds it in your subconscious mind so that your acceptance of its truth becomes a conditioned response. You accept this information as true without thinking whenever it is presented to you again.\u201d\n\nThis is why most of mankind has lived under tyranny. People will believe anything if they hear it enough. Folks! You better start facing Reality and taking charge of what you believe.\n\nThe Big Lie\n\nThe gist of this is to:\n\n\u201c\u2026keep repeating the same lie[s] over and over, in spite of all arguments and evidence to the contrary, until people believe it. Massive repetition is essential.\u201d\n\nIt has already been proved by this and other writers that everything the conspirators say about nullification and a \u201cconvention\u201d is false. But they keep repeating it. Why?\n\nBecause massive repetition of lies will induce people to believe them.\n\nFabricated Legal Principles & Precedent [\u201cImaginary Evidence\u201d]\n\nThe FAQs make various assertions about how this \u201cconvention of states\u201d would operate, such as:\n\n\u2022 \u201cThe applications must request a convention of states for the same subject matter\u201d or \u201csame issue\u201d;\n\n\u2022 \u201cStates are free to develop their own selection process for choosing their delegates\u2026 each state has one vote at the convention.\u201d\n\nThe FAQs say this reflects \u201cwidely accepted\u201d \u201cprocedures and rules\u201d Rob Natelson found during his \u201cextensive research,\u201d which were followed in the \u201cinterstate conventions\u201d which \u201cwere common\u201d during \u201cthe Founding Era.\u201d\n\nFolks! If these customs existed and established binding precedent on the Congress we created when we ratified our Constitution, why did James Madison not know about them? During the Federal Convention of 1787, Madison said, respecting Article V:\n\nSeptember 10, 1787: Mr. Madison remarked on the vagueness of the terms, \u201ccall a Convention for the purpose,\u201d as sufficient reason for reconsidering the article. \u201cHow was a Convention to be formed? \u2013 by what rule decide? \u2013 what the force of its acts?\u201d September 15, 1787: Mr. Madison did not see why Congress would not be as much bound to propose amendments applied for by two-thirds of the States, as to call a Convention on the like application. He saw no objection, however, against providing for a Convention for the purpose of amendments, except only that difficulties might arise as to the form, the quorum, & c., which in constitutional regulations ought to be as much as possible avoided.\n\nDo you see? And don\u2019t forget: Article V says Congress calls the convention; and Art. I, Sec. 8, last clause, delegates to Congress power to make laws needed to execute the powers vested in it by Article V. This constitutional provision supersedes any \u201ccustoms\u201d to the contrary.\n\nOversimplify\n\nThe gist of this technique is to:\n\n\u201cReduce the issue to a few simple sentences that any blithering idiot can understand. Leave out all the complicated facts and confounding factors. Reduce the debate to just a few simple-minded sentences and slogans. Reduce complex multi-faceted issues to simplistic statements that can be expressed in a short sound bite.\u201d\n\nAren\u2019t the FAQs a few simple concepts any blithering idiot can understand?\n\nIt is this and other writers who point out the \u201ccomplicated facts\u201d. Are we too stupid to be free?\n\nExploit Wishful Thinking\n\nWith this technique, you tell people what they want to hear, rather than the unpleasant truths.\n\nThe conspirators are offering an easy way out which satisfies a deep yearning: to feel good. We don\u2019t have to accept responsibility for our own failures to become a \u201cnatural guardian of the Constitution\u201d; we are encouraged to blame shift and see the Constitution as the cause of our problems; and we don\u2019t have to trouble ourselves to actually learn our Founding Principles & Documents. All we have to do is join the conspirators. And then, everything will be wonderful.\n\nThe Self-sell\n\nThis technique gets people to convince themselves of your ideas by asking for their help in promoting your ideas. \u201cThey will sell themselves on the idea as they try to sell it to others.\u201d\n\nSubscribe to NewsWithViews Daily E-Mail Alerts! Enter Your E-Mail Address:\n\n\n\nOrange gives this example of the Self-sell: In \"Cold Turkey\", Dick Van Dyke plays a preacher who wants everyone in his town to quit smoking. He got the local Neo-Nazis to quit by enlisting them as \u201csmoking-ban enforcers\u201d.\n\nThe conspirators want to build a \u201cgrassroots operation\u201d of volunteers to sell their scheme to State legislators [the ones who already sold us to the feds for federal funds.] And we have seen these volunteers\u2019 mindless comments on the internet as they regurgitate the talking points in the FAQs - they sell themselves as they try to sell to others. [8]\n\nConclusion\n\nYou better wise up now. Study this chart. Flesh it out with your readings of our Declaration of Independence and Constitution. Have study groups. What Hamilton asked you to be is not hard.\n\n\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd 2014 Publius Huldah - All Rights Reserved\n\nEndnotes:\n\n1. Our Framers never saw courts as the final authority. See James Madison Rebukes Nullification Deniers. Hamilton expected us to be \u201ca people enlightened enough to distinguish between a legal exercise and an illegal usurpation of authority\u201d (Federalist No. 16, next to last para).\n\n2. Politicians are as ignorant as those who elect them. But we want a savior who will rescue us without any effort on our part. So we look to politicians to save us. They always betray us; and we are presented with still another phony who says what we want to hear, whom we support, and who betrays us. This happens because we don\u2019t know our Constitution, and thus can\u2019t evaluate the politicians. If WE knew our Constitution, those smooth-talking ignoramuses wouldn\u2019t have a chance of getting elected. You would see right through them.\n\n3. Progressives & phony \u201cconservatives\u201d have worked hand in hand for many years to replace our Constitution. See Richard D. Fry, \"Convention of States\": The Wrong Solution to the Wrong Problem.\n\n4. The conspirators tell the brazen lie that the convention \u201ccannot throw out the Constitution because it derives its authority from the Constitution.\u201d Rubbish! Pursuant to Article XIII of The Articles of Confederation, the Continental Congress resolved on February 21, 1787 (p 71-74):\n\n\u201cResolved that in the opinion of Congress it is expedient that on the second Monday in May next a Convention of delegates who shall have been appointed by the several states be held at Philadelphia for the sole and express purpose of revising the Articles of Confederation and reporting to Congress and the several legislatures such alterations and provisions therein as shall when agreed to in Congress and confirmed by the states render the federal constitution adequate to the exigencies of Government & the preservation of the Union.\u201d [emphasis mine]\n\nThe delegates ignored these limitations and wrote a new Constitution with a new method of ratification. It is impossible to stop this from happening at another convention. And George Washington, James Madison, Ben Franklin, and Alexander Hamilton won\u2019t be there.\n\nThe conspirators also say a \u201cConstitutional Convention\u201d is safe because no amendment will be passed which is not ratified by \u00be of the States. This is deceptive because the concern is about a runaway convention &a new Constitution \u2013 not amendments. Since a new Constitution can have any method of ratification the delegates want, it can be forced on us.\n\n5. See Propaganda and Debating Techniques by A. Orange. Orange is a \u201clibrul\u201d, and on a vendetta against AA. But he understands how scoundrels use propaganda to deceive the unthinking. See how Adolf Hitler used these same techniques to manipulate the German People.\n\n6. I addressed this same lie in \u201cMark Levin Refuted: Keep the Feds in Check with Nullification, not Amendments!\u201d under the subheading, \u201cWhat Levin Claims Article V Says\u201d. Congress\u2019 lack of discretion is limited to the issue of \u201cto call or not to call\u201d a convention once the requisite number of States has applied for it. After Congress \u201ccalls\u201d the convention, Art. I, Sec. 8, last clause kicks in to empower Congress to make all laws necessary to carry out the call\n\n7. The result of the voting amendments (15th, 19th, 24th,26th) was to transfer the power of determining voter qualifications from the States (Art. I, Sec. 2, cl.1) to the federal government.\n\nIt was necessary to amend the Constitution to remedy the defects which permitted slavery; but the 13th, 14th, and 15thAmendments delegated powers over the States to the federal government. It would have been better to merely repeal the provisions at Art. I, Sec. 2, cl.3 which provided for a partial counting of slaves; and Art.IV, Sec. 2, cl. 3 which permitted Congress to make laws against fugitive slaves. And if the States had been wise instead of foolish, they would have banned slavery and extended citizenship & civil rights to freed slaves on their own, and provided the education to help them make the transition from slave to citizen. Stupidity and wickedness are not cheap, Folks.And Amendments are a very tricky business\n\n\n\n8. There is nothing wrong with asking others to help promote ideas \u2013 when the ideas are True and Good.
