It will also indicate if you should wait before updating your password, or if a site and your password are not at risk.\n\nYou can run the check in three ways. It works from your desktop browser either by tapping the service's add-ons Tools option and choosing Security Check, or logging in via the Web site and choosing Security Check from the left column.
