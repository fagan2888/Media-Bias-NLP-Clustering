As Patrick Coffee of PRNewser writes:\n\nIf we\u2019d been tasked with creating a visual ad to mock the Affordable Care Act, it would have looked something like this one: stereotypical party girl empowered to have a one-night stand with a total bro. Based on the social media response, many others felt the same way.\n\nAnd the New York Post writes how \u201ceasy sex and booze\u201d are being \u201cused to sell ObamaCare:\n\nSign up for ObamaCare and get a sleazy hookup. Colorado has launched a new ad campaign that attempts to entice young women to sign up for the new national health-care program with the promise of free contraceptives and carefree sex.\n\nThis ad is a bad idea for many reasons. Among them \u2013 a rejection of a responsible lifestyle, a promotion of sex with anyone who qualifies as \u201chot,\u201d a bare-minimum attempt at actually making the sex \u201csafe,\u201d and an objectification of women.\n\nWhile the ad (in a small note at the bottom) qualifies that birth control pills don\u2019t protect against STDs and states that \u201ccondoms and common sense do that,\u201d it still celebrates \u2013 and encourages \u2013 reckless behavior. If the creators of this ad truly wanted young women and men to be healthy, one would assume they would wage a campaign on preventing STDs. Instead, they create an ad that could instead encourage behavior that will promote STDs \u2013 not exactly a healthy result.\n\nUnfortunately, those who claim to support \u201csafe sex\u201d often use it as an excuse to promote irresponsible sex in general. All too often, the guise of \u201csafe sex\u201d is used to push young adults toward a promiscuous and dangerous lifestyle. Little wonder the rate of young people with STDs has skyrocketed above that of the general population.\n\nOne of the most offensive features of this ad is the portrayal of a young woman as all-too-eager to get a \u201chot\u201d guy in bed. It objectifies women as promiscuous, slutty, and focused only on sex. Forget relationships, forget emotions, forget commitment, and forget responsibility \u2013 this campaign is screaming that all women care about is sex. This ought to be offensive to any truly progressive woman.\n\nColorado-based blogger, Kelly Maher, says it well: \u201cLiberal ladies you have lost the right to call anyone a misogynist again.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s most outrageous of all, however, is that these ads are supporting a program \u2013 ObamaCare \u2013 that many Americans are being forced to participate in. Some have claimed that these ads are taxpayer funded, though the claim remains unconfirmed. It is known that one ad partner \u2013 the Colorado Consumer Health Initiative \u2013 has received taxpayer funds designated for a purpose other than the ad.\n\nEven if this disturbing ad is not taxpayer funded, the American people should be getting an ever clearer picture of how ObamaCare can be used as a way to funnel money to President Obama\u2019s pro-abortion buddies. As usual, Planned Parenthood is a prime example, as they have been paid to sign citizens up for ObamaCare. Many average Americans will be forced to pay for others\u2019 abortions. And effort after effort is made to keep full transparency from the American public.\n\nThe only question left is this: when will the outrage stop?", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Live Action News", "description": "94 Like93 Tweet0 +11A sexually suggestive ad supporting ObamaCare has left plenty of Americans disturbed.
