We've got what you missed. (Photo: Jack Gruber, USA TODAY)\n\nWe won't know the fate of Obamacare for months, but we got a glimpse of its future today\n\nThe opinions of Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Anthony Kennedy will likely decide the fate of Obamacare. Today at the Supreme Court there were tense, heated arguments over the Affordable Care Act. The packed room watched anxiously for clues about how the justices were leaning, and those in attendance were able to get a read on everyone but poker-faced Roberts and hard-to-pin-down Kennedy. The case is the most serious obstacle to the Affordable Care Act since 2012 \u2014 more serious than its occasionally balky website, wavering public opinion ratings or Republican opposition in Congress. Today's case is narrow (unlike the one argued three years ago) and boils down to a fight over four words in the law: \"established by the state.\" It could affect the tax credits used by millions of Americans to pay insurance premiums \u2014 more on that here. Here's a look at the case by the numbers. We'll likely learn the court's decision by the end of June.\n\nWhat else is in #TheShortList:\n\n\u2022 'It was him:' Dramatic opening in Boston bombing trial\n\n\u2022 No charges for ex-Ferguson cop Darren Wilson\n\n\u2022 Battleship, found! Billionaire says he's solved a WWII mystery\n\n\u2022 A-Rod takes the field to a round of applause\n\nTsarnaev's lawyer admits he carried out Boston bombing\n\nThe court of public opinion pretty much convicted him in 2013. Today, even his lawyer bluntly said, \"It was him.\" The question for jurors seems to be, should Dzhokhar Tsarnaev live or die? The 21 year old went on trial today in Boston, which is still aching from the attack on its beloved Boston Marathon. The trial is expected to take several months and is the most-watched terror case since the Oklahoma City bombing trial nearly 20 years ago. Dzhokhar is accused of carrying out the attacks with his older brother, Tamerlan, who died in a shootout with police days after the bombings. Dzhokhar's attorney argued Dzhokhar fell under Tamerlan's evil influence, but prosecutors say he was an equal participant who acted of his own free will. Boston wants closure. The victims \u2014 three people were killed, and more than 260 were hurt \u2014 want justice. (Many of them were in the courtroom today, choking back tears.) And America is #BostonStrong.\n\nSkip Ad Ad Loading... x Embed x Share Here are the facts in the case against Boston Marathon Bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev.\n\nIt's official: Justice Department won't charge ex-Ferguson cop Darren Wilson\n\nThe Justice Department won't bring criminal charges against former Ferguson, Mo., police officer Darren Wilson, who fatally shot black teenager Michael Brown in August. The decision, outlined in a 86-page memorandum made public today, says Wilson, who is white, acted in self-defense. Officials had signaled weeks ago that prosecution was not likely. But its separate examination of overall police operations found rampant evidence of racial bias in a department that long ago lost the public trust of its African-American residents. Among the most serious findings: In nearly 90% of cases in which use of force was documented, those actions were used against blacks. Here's a look at what could happen next in Ferguson.\n\nDarren Wilson during his medical examination after he fatally shot Michael Brown, in Ferguson, Mo.

The Musashi was considered one of the world's largest and most technologically advanced warships when it sank off the Philippines during World War II. Nearly half the crew of 2,399 Japanese sailors lost their lives when the ship went down under a barrage of 19 torpedoes and 17 bombs from the Americans on Oct. 24, 1944. It's been missing ever since \u2014 until now. A research team led by Microsoft co-founder and philanthropist Paul Allen found it, according to the expedition's website. Using an underwater vehicle, the team found the Musashi on Sunday in the Sibuyan Sea. Allen said he respects the area as a war grave and plans to work with the Japanese government \"to ensure the site is treated respectfully and in accordance with Japanese traditions.\"\n\nThis picture taken on Oct. 24. 1944, shows Japanese battleship Musashi, which sank in the Sibuyan Sea in the Philippines after coming under blistering U.S. air raids.

Since then, he's had a tumultuous journey through the Biogenesis scandal. There's been personal and legal strife between player and team. A-Rod and the Yankees need each other, and today, when the fallen star stepped up to the plate at George M. Steinbrenner Field in Tampa, fans gave him a hearty cheer. A hit, a single, not to mention the generally positive reception from the crowd, will certainly make A-Rod feel good after being gone from the game for so long. But it indicates nothing meaningful beyond that he's still healthy enough to swing a bat and jog to first base. By game's end, he grounded out and walked before leaving in the sixth inning.\n\nWhat else is on our reading list today:\n\n\u2022 China is easing its infamous 'one-child' policy\n\n\u2022 Prospective GOP candidate Ben Carson says being gay is a choice, citing prisons\n\n\u2022 Storm to dump snow from Texas to Northeast and airlines cancel hundreds of flights\n\nExtra Bites:\n\nThis photo made us do a double-take.
