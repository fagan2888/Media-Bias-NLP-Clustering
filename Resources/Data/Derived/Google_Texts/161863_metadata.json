Kennedy\u2019s tax cuts in the 1960s, where the highest marginal income taxes were dropped from 91 to 70 percent and the lowest from 20 to 14 percent.\n\nUnder these cuts, those in the highest tax bracket could now keep 30 cents of every dollar they made versus the 9 cents they were able to keep prior to the tax cuts. Similarly, those in the lowest tax bracket could now keep 86 cents of every dollar versus the previous 80 cents.\n\nThis cut, Laffer continued, reaped the greatest cost-benefit ratio for those in the highest tax bracket, giving them a steeper incentive to work because they were able to keep more of what they worked for.\n\n\u201cThe reason you cut tax rates on highest group is not because you love rich people \u2026 it\u2019s because you get more bang for the buck,\u201d he said.\n\nIf the government takes from someone who makes more, Laffer continued, the government has reduced that person\u2019s incentives to earn income, and that person will in turn produce less. If the government then gives that money to those who have less, they now have a source of income other than work and will also produce less.\n\n\u201cWhenever you redistribute income, you lower total income. Period,\u201d he said.\n\nTo Laffer, a flat tax solves this problem, encouraging work by overhauling the entire federal tax code and replacing it with two taxes: a sales tax and a flat income tax.\n\nLaffer predicted that this overhaul would ignite \u201cthe boom of all centuries.\u201d To him, the timing could not be more right.\n\n\u201cAmerican people feel the tax system is so corrupt right now and filled with special interest provisions,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you wipe out all those special preferences, you\u2019re going to take power away from Washington and replace it to the people.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Laffer joined The Heritage Foundation\u2019s tax expert Steve Moore Monday to resell the pertinence of his Reagan-era tax cuts during a Heritage panel.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Laffer joined The Heritage Foundation\u2019s tax expert Steve Moore Monday to resell the pertinence of his Reagan-era tax cuts during a Heritage panel.", "title": "Arthur Laffer Resells His Reagan-Era Tax Cuts", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150720_MoreTaxCode_Johnson.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-07-22T12:11:15+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1Ml6nI3"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Laffer joined The Heritage Foundation\u2019s tax expert Steve Moore Monday to resell the pertinence of his Reagan-era tax cuts during a Heritage panel.", "title": "Arthur Laffer Resells His Reagan-Era Tax Cuts", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150720_MoreTaxCode_Johnson.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "taxes", "published_time": "2015-07-20T20:01:26+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-22T12:11:15+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Arthur Laffer, supply-side economics, Steven Moore, Laffer curve, flat tax"}, "article_summary": "To Laffer, a flat tax solves this problem, encouraging work by overhauling the entire federal tax code and replacing it with two taxes: a sales tax and a flat income tax.\n\u201cWe are at a stage in our history where we need a low-rate, broad-based, flat tax,\u201d Laffer said, repeating the mantra throughout his talk.\nUnder these cuts, those in the highest tax bracket could now keep 30 cents of every dollar they made versus the 9 cents they were able to keep prior to the tax cuts.\nArthur Laffer sat at dinner with Ford administration officials Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld 40 years ago, sketching his tax policy theory in sharpie on the back of a cloth napkin, declaring that tax cuts would stimulate the floundering economy.\nSimilarly, those in the lowest tax bracket could now keep 86 cents of every dollar versus the previous 80 cents."}
