Gary Herbert last year put forward his Healthy Utah plan. It passed the state Senate by one vote (a few Democratic votes needed there).\n\nBut it failed in a House vote late in the session. GOP House members passed a more pared down expansion, called Utah Cares. It went nowhere in the Senate.\n\nThere was a committee hearing on Healthy Utah in the House (it failed) and further debate and vote on Healthy Utah on the House floor (it failed in a motion to substitute Healthy Utah for Utah Cares, HB446).\n\nAnd the 2015 session ended with no Medicaid expansion, as provided for in Obamacare.\n\nHerbert then put together a special committee of six leading GOP officeholders, including himself. After months of private meetings, the so-called Gang of Six came up with a plan that would have taxed Utah\u2019s medical community to pay for most of the state\u2019s 10 percent share of expansion under Obamacare.\n\nBut both the House and Senate GOP caucuses killed that plan quickly.\n\nHerbert says he won\u2019t push Healthy Utah in the 2016 Legislature, and won\u2019t propose an alternative.\n\nHouse Speaker Greg Hughes, R-Draper, says House Majority Leader Jim Dunnigan, R-Taylorsville, and other House Republicans will work on yet another alternative \u2013 one aimed at just covering the neediest in the so-called coverage gap of around 43,000 low-income Utahns.\n\nThat plan has not yet been unveiled.\n\nJones finds in his new survey \u2013 just finished last week \u2013 that various demographic groupings favor some kind of Medicaid expansion adopted by the upcoming Legislature:\n\n-- Utah Republicans back expansion, 62-32 percent.\n\n-- Political independents want expansion, 74-21 percent.\n\n-- And Utah Democrats really, really want expansion, 96-4 percent.\n\nMedicaid expansion has been before the Utah public for three years now, and it is evident by the small number of \u201cundecideds\u201d that Utahns seem to understand, at least in a broad stroke, what is at stake \u2013 health care insurance/coverage for the poorer among us, with Utah taxpayers likely having to pick up some of the cost.\n\n(The split is actually 90 percent fed money, 10 percent state money.)\n\nUtah House Republicans balk at paying even the 10 percent, saying, among other things, that the federal government is broke and won\u2019t keep its 90 percent cost-sharing promise, there is too much uncertainty in estimates of how much expansion would cost the state, and critical programs like public and higher education would be at risk if expansion goes forward.\n\nLeaders of the LDS Church have not endorsed any Medicaid expansion plan but have asked Utahns to be understanding and merciful of the poor.\n\nJones finds that among those who said they are \u201cvery active\u201d in the LDS Church, expansion is favored 64-29 percent.\n\nEven among those who told Jones they are \u201cvery conservative\u201d politically, expansion is favored 53-42 percent.\n\nJones polled 845 adults from Jan. 6-13. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.37 percent.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Nearly three-fourths of Utahns want the upcoming 2016 Legislature to pass some kind of Medicaid expansion to cover low-income, uninsured citizens, a new UtahPolicy poll finds.", "generator": "Joomla! - Open Source Content Management", "author": "Bob Bernick", "og": {"url": "http://utahpolicy.com/index.php/features/today-at-utah-policy/8247-poll-big-majority-of-utahns-want-some-sort-of-medicaid-expansion", "site_name": "utahpolicy.com", "image": "http://utahpolicy.com/images/articles/Utah_State_Capitol_11.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Poll: Big Majority of Utahns Want Some Sort of Medicaid Expansion"}, "google-site-verification": "lihgswQmNHE4uzDhVlR0Saxekx4JgwwjFYC6fjhIvCM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Leaders of the LDS Church have not endorsed any Medicaid expansion plan but have asked Utahns to be understanding and merciful of the poor.\nA quarter (25 percent) don\u2019t want any Medicaid expansion, Jones finds, and 5 percent don\u2019t know.\nAnd the 2015 session ended with no Medicaid expansion, as provided for in Obamacare.\nThere was a committee hearing on Healthy Utah in the House (it failed) and further debate and vote on Healthy Utah on the House floor (it failed in a motion to substitute Healthy Utah for Utah Cares, HB446).\nNearly three-fourths of Utahns want the upcoming 2016 Legislature to pass some kind of Medicaid expansion to cover low-income, uninsured citizens, a new UtahPolicy poll finds."}
