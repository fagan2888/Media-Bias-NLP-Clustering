Sarah Palin during the 2008 campaign. Clinton said that she chose not to attack the former Republican vice presidential nominee strictly \u201cfor being a woman.\u201d\n\nThat assertion apparently riled a few Obama campaign veterans who, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told Politico reporters that Clinton\u2019s recollection of events left much to be desired.\n\n\u201cWe wanted Hillary to go out and say the Republican platform is completely inconsistent with the principles on which I ran,\u201d said the official, adding that it was not supposed to be a broad-based knock on Palin.\n\nIt seems as though the sting of Clinton implying that Team Obama wanted her to mount a cheap attack on Palin based on nothing more than her gender remains inflamed. Yet another Obama campaign veteran who refused to be identified recently told Politico in blunt terms that the former secretary of state was mischaracterizing that event.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what happened,\u201d said one campaign veteran, who, like almost everyone else interviewed, asked not to be identified. \u201cThe Palin thing was an odd way to put it. The question that was raised with numerous Democratic leaders was whether Gov. Palin had the right experience to be a heartbeat away from the presidency, and it\u2019s the same question that would have been raised regardless of gender.\u201d\n\nThis may be a harbinger of future rifts between Teams Clinton and Obama. Politico indicates that administration and campaign staffers are not taking Clinton\u2019s routine efforts to distance herself from the current occupant of the Oval Office well.\n\nWhite House aides acknowledge that there will have to be a high tolerance for her creating distance with the administration. They want the Democratic nominee to win, no matter who it is, and if that means spelling out differences with the president, then so be it. But they don\u2019t expect that to happen for a while because, at this point, Clinton will need to show that she was part of a successful presidency and undermining him wouldn\u2019t help.\n\nThere is a natural tension between a president and a member of his party seeking to succeed him, and the White House knows that Clinton will have to create some distance between her and Obama as the 2016 cycle accelerates. \u201cBut the Palin story pulled at scabs from a messy Democratic primary, and served as a reminder that some wounds haven\u2019t totally healed,\u201d Politico reported.\n\nAnd that scab is only going to get bloodier. On Tuesday, Clinton created some daylight between herself and the president on how Obama has handled America\u2019s foreign affairs.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we should be retreating from the world,\u201d Clinton said on CNN, in an implicit rebuke of the president\u2019s policy of American retrenchment. She added that she would have preferred the West take the lead on arming Syria\u2019s rebels \u201cyou know, two plus years ago.\u201d\n\nIn that interview, Clinton went on to insist that the United States should not coordinate with Iran on matters relating to Iraqi security. \u201cI am not prepared to say that we go in with Iran right now, until we have a better idea what we\u2019re getting ourselves into,\u201d she insisted.\n\nThat statement came just hours after her successor, Secretary of State John Kerry, said that cooperation with Iran to address the escalating violence in Iraq was on the table. \u201cI think we are open to any constructive process here that could minimize the violence, hold Iraq together \u2014 the integrity of the country \u2014 and eliminate the presence of outside terrorist forces that are ripping it apart,\u201d Kerry said on Monday.\n\nHe quickly backtracked and, in conjunction with the White House, later asserted that a negotiation with Iran over Iraqi security issues is \u201cnot on the table.\u201d\n\nAs Clinton, a prominent Democratic figure and former administration official, seeks to replace a two-term president of her party, she will necessarily have to create some distance between her and her former boss. These internecine squabbles are to be expected as Clinton and Obama\u2019s alliance of convenience collapses. However, it is just as natural for the president\u2019s supporters to be enraged by Clinton\u2019s efforts to recast history in order to create space between her and the president. Expect the backbiting to continue.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Tense.", "title": "Team Obama getting pretty tired of Hillary throwing them under the bus", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/06/19/team-obama-getting-pretty-tired-of-hillary-throwing-them-under-the-bus/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "keywords": "Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, John Kerry, Sarah Palin,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-19T19:21:07+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-19T21:44:01+00:00"}, "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2977\"", "article_summary": "Yet another Obama campaign veteran who refused to be identified recently told Politico in blunt terms that the former secretary of state was mischaracterizing that event.\nOn Tuesday, Clinton created some daylight between herself and the president on how Obama has handled America\u2019s foreign affairs.\nIt seems as though the sting of Clinton implying that Team Obama wanted her to mount a cheap attack on Palin based on nothing more than her gender remains inflamed.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what happened,\u201d said one campaign veteran, who, like almost everyone else interviewed, asked not to be identified.\nWhite House aides acknowledge that there will have to be a high tolerance for her creating distance with the administration."}
