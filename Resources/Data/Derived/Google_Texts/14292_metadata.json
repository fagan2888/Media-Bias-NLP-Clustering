Adam Taylor of the Washington Post reports: In the wake of a shooting in Chapel Hill, N.C., that left three young American Muslims dead, Turkish President Tayyip Erdo\u011fan made an unusual public criticism of American domestic policy Thursday, specifically challenging President Obama. \"If you stay silent when faced with an incident like this, and don't make a statement, the world will stay silent towards you,\" Erdo\u011fan said during a state visit to Mexico on Thursday, according to Al Jazeera. \u201cI ask Mr. Obama, where are you, Mr. President?\" Local police have stressed that there has been no determination of a hate crime, but Eric Holder\u2019s Justice Department has dispatched the FBI to try to dig up something. But in the meantime:\n\nBy Friday afternoon, Obama had addressed the shootings, releasing a statement that called the deaths \u201cbrutal and outrageous.\" These comments were quickly portrayed by Turkey's pro-government media as being linked to Erdogan's outrage: #UPDATE #Obama condemns 'outrageous' murders of #Muslim students after #Erdo\u011fan's call http://t.co/yObehvGg43 pic.twitter.com/An2fnVOLAO \u2014 DAILY SABAH (@DailySabah) \u0130\u015fin \u00f6z\u00fc Obama'n\u0131n a\u00e7\u0131klamas\u0131ndaki i\u00e7erik de\u011fil, Cumhurba\u015fkan\u0131'm\u0131z\u0131n hayk\u0131r\u0131\u015f\u0131na ses vermek zorunda kalmas\u0131d\u0131r. \u2014 \u015eamil Tayyar (@samiltayyar27) February 13, 2015 \u2014 DAILY SABAH (@DailySabah) February 13, 2015 The idea that Obama has to comment on the death of three Muslims while Erdogan gets a pass on the anti-Semitism he is spreading throughout the word, as well as the murder of Jews in Turkey, is offensive.
