Under the Republican bill, these workers would now have to work 40 hours a week to be assured of coverage.\n\nBackers of the plan include business groups, not advocates for low-income Americans, which prompted some Democrats to scoff at the GOP\u2019s argument that they\u2019re on the side of struggling employees.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure every American worker is saying: thank God the Republicans are going to have me work 10 more hours before I can get health insurance. Aren\u2019t you generous?\u201d Representative Steny Hoyer (D-Maryland) said.\n\nThe GOP plan, known as the Save American Workers Act, cleared the House 252 to 172, and could pass the Senate as well. Two Democratic senators, Joe Donnelly of Indiana and Joe Manchin of West Virginia, are co-sponsors of the measure. But if it reaches the White House, President Barack Obama is likely to veto it since it would undercut a key provision of his signature policy achievement.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office said the Republican bill would result in 1 million people losing their health care coverage, forcing them either into government-supported plans or having no medical insurance at all. That would force an increase in federal spending of $53.2 billion over the next decade. Republicans, usually concerned about increasing the deficit, have not yet announced how they\u2019ll pay for the higher costs.\n\nThe plan wouldn\u2019t even save many jobs. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, only about 7% of employees work 30 to 34 hours a week, the range in which it would make sense to cut someone\u2019s hours to keep them off insurance. However, if the threshold is moved to 40 hours, it would be easy for employers to move those people, who make up 44% of the workforce, from 40 hours to 39, thus avoiding the insurance mandate and taking away healthcare from millions.\n\n-Noel Brinkerhoff, Steve Straehley\n\nTo Learn More:\n\nHouse Fires Shot at Health Care Law, Seeking to Alter Critical Coverage Rule (by Jonathan Weisman, New York Times)\n\nHouse Votes Down Obamacare\u2019s 30-Hour Workweek, 252-172 (by Sarah Ferris and Cristina Marcos, The Hill)\n\nHealth Reform Not Causing Significant Shift to Part-Time Work (by Paul N.
