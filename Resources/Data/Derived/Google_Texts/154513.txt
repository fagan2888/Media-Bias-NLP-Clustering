Trader Guy Adami looked to surging names that "still work." He sees continued upside for Netflix, despite a gain of nearly 170 percent this year.

He also contended that Microsoft — which has climbed 20 percent this year — could touch all-time highs reached in 1999.

Trader Karen Finerman looked domestically to health insurer Anthem. The company — which sold off on UnitedHealth's Affordable Care Act warning but later said it wasn't affected — looks to have upside, she said.
