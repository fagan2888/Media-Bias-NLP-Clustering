Nine zoos along the way were on standby to help the crew transporting if needed, according to the release.\n\nJoni was found dead by a zoo employee during a fuel stop between Amarillo, Texas, and Colorado Springs, The Associated Press reported.\n\nAnimals rarely pass away during transport, but with larger, older animals there comes more risk, according to the release. Officials from both zoos say the decision to move Joni was in the elephant\u2019s best interest.\n\n\u201cDespite this loss, we still know in our hearts that moving Joni to Colorado was the right decision,\u201d Chastain said.\n\nA necropsy will be performed by veterinary staff members from both zoos to determine a cause of death.\n\nJesse Paul: 303-954-1733, jpaul@denverpost.com or twitter.com/jesseapaul.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "44-year-old African elephant dies en route to Colorado Springs zoo", "title": "44-year-old African elephant dies en route to Colorado Springs zoo", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/06/15/44-year-old-african-elephant-dies-en-route-to-colorado-springs-zoo/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140615__Joni-at-Greenville-Zoo-2p1.jpg", "height": 490}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140615__Joni-at-Greenville-Zoo-2p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-15T16:28:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T09:47:37+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc78e\"", "article_summary": "Joni was found dead by a zoo employee during a fuel stop between Amarillo, Texas, and Colorado Springs, The Associated Press reported.\nAn elderly African elephant making her way across the country to find a new home \u2014 and new friends \u2014 in Colorado Springs has died, officials at the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo said Sunday.\n\u201cDespite this loss, we still know in our hearts that moving Joni to Colorado was the right decision,\u201d Chastain said.\n\u201cWe knew there was risk involved in transporting Joni because of her age,\u201d Bob Chastain, Cheyenne Mountain Zoo president and CEO, said in a news release.\nNine zoos along the way were on standby to help the crew transporting if needed, according to the release."}
