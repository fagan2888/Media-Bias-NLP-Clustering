The resulting smaller government would mean that \u201cthey don\u2019t have time to stick their noses in people\u2019s business,\u201d he said, to applause.\n\nOn the Affordable Care Act \u2014 which Carson has on several occasions compared to slavery \u2014 the famous former surgeon said he opposed any government intrusion in health care. \u201cEven if it worked, I would oppose it,\u201d Carson said of Obamacare. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe in taking the most important thing a person has, which is their health and their health care, and putting it in the hands of the government,\u201d he later added, a potential reference also to Medicare and Medicaid. The ACA, Carson said, \u201cfundamentally changes\u201d the U.S. and puts it on the road to putting government in charge of Americans\u2019 personal lives.\n\nCarson also criticized President Barack Obama\u2019s executive order on immigration, saying that Congress, not the White House, had the authority to take action. Later in his speech, though, he said that he didn\u2019t think undocumented immigrants \u201cshould have to hide in the shadows,\u201d and proposed that the U.S. pursue a guest-worker program similar to that in Canada.\n\nCarson peppered his wide-ranging speech with self-deprecating humor about being a poor student as a child and personal anecdotes about pushing back against those who blame their struggles on institutional unfairness.\n\nCarson, who would likely be the only African-American candidate on the GOP side if he chooses to run in 2016, has pleased conservatives by taking on Democrats on matters of race.\n\n\u201cWe cannot allow progressives to shut us up through political correctness,\u201d he said.\n\nCarson, appearing loose as he ambled around the stage, also said he wanted to retire after his surgery career but that the \u201cmonster\u201d of the national debt wouldn\u2019t allow him to sit on the sidelines.\n\nThough considered a long shot to win the GOP nomination, Carson has significant appeal among Iowa Republicans \u2014 he came in second to Mitt Romney in an October Bloomberg Politics/Des Moines Register poll of the state\u2019s likely GOP caucusgoers.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "His speech demonstrated the appeal of his potential outsider candidacy for the 2016 presidential nomination.", "title": "Carson draws raucous applause", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/01/ben-carson-iowa-summit-114553.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/01/24/150124_ben_carson_gty_1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Iowa,Ben Carson,Iowa Freedom Summit", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "His speech demonstrated the appeal of his potential outsider candidacy for the 2016 presidential nomination.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9c84\"", "article_summary": "Carson draws raucous applauseBen Carson on Saturday delivered a forceful defense of conservatism, arguing for dramatically scaling back the federal government and saying that he wouldn\u2019t support Obamacare even if it worked.\nCarson, the retired neurosurgeon who has become a darling among grassroots conservatives, drew raucous applause from the crowd at the Iowa Freedom Summit in Des Moines.\nOn the Affordable Care Act \u2014 which Carson has on several occasions compared to slavery \u2014 the famous former surgeon said he opposed any government intrusion in health care.\nCarson said that the U.S. should cut its government by \u201cattrition\u201d \u2014 not replacing any federal employees that retire in the next 4-5 years.\nCarson also criticized President Barack Obama\u2019s executive order on immigration, saying that Congress, not the White House, had the authority to take action."}
