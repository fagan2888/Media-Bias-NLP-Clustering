Well, just one voter showed up to the former Pennsylvania senator\u2019s Iowa campaign stop on Monday. Omens can\u2019t get any more foreboding than that, can they?\n\nAccording to POLITICO, the lone voter showed up to the 2 p.m. campaign stop in a diner in Hamlin, Iowa, a community with a population of about 300. CNN dubbed this stop part of his \u201cempty diner strategy.\u201d Damn, that\u2019s cold.\n\nThat one voter was Peggy Toft, who also happens to chair the Audubon County Republican Party. However, after spending 10 minutes of one-on-one time with Santorum, and presumably sharing onion rings with the presidential hopeful, Toft wouldn\u2019t fully commit to supporting him in the caucus, although she does remark that she is leaning that way.\n\n\u201cI feel like I have to get all of the facts,\u201d Toft said.\n\nIt\u2019s worth pointing out that Toft does already agree with Santorum\u2019s conservative views on family values, the Affordable Care Act, and his opposition to gay marriage.\n\nHowever, it sounds like Santorum doesn\u2019t see almost nonexistent turnout as a setback.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t understand. One guy in there said, \u2018I\u2019ll speak for you at the caucus,\u2019\u201d Santorum said. \u201cThat\u2019s maybe eight votes that you wouldn\u2019t otherwise get. Eight votes can make a big difference, as I know.\u201d\n\nYou keep telling yourself that, bub.\n\nI mean, in Santorum\u2019s defense, an empty campaign stop isn\u2019t the most embarrassing thing you\u2019ll find when you Google the guy.\n\n[POLITICO | Image: CNN Politics]", "article_metadata": {"description": "The one voter didn't quite commit to voting for him in the caucus yet.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Death and Taxes", "description": "The one voter didn\u2019t quite commit to voting for him in the caucus yet.", "title": "Just one voter shows up to Santorum campaign stop in Iowa", "url": "http://www.deathandtaxesmag.com/251755/santorum-one-voter-iowa-diner/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://static.deathandtaxesmag.com/uploads/2015/06/santorum-empty-diner.jpg", "height": 404}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The one voter didn\u2019t quite commit to voting for him in the caucus yet.", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 119986914707220}, "keywords": "ol\\' frothy,santorum,santorum 2016,news", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-10T14:30:52Z", "modified_time": "2015-06-10T14:15:54Z"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Well, just one voter showed up to the former Pennsylvania senator\u2019s Iowa campaign stop on Monday.\nAccording to POLITICO, the lone voter showed up to the 2 p.m. campaign stop in a diner in Hamlin, Iowa, a community with a population of about 300.\nI mean, in Santorum\u2019s defense, an empty campaign stop isn\u2019t the most embarrassing thing you\u2019ll find when you Google the guy.\nThat one voter was Peggy Toft, who also happens to chair the Audubon County Republican Party.\nRick Santorum, or Ol\u2019 Frothy if you are using Joe Veix\u2019s handy Presidential Name Swamp browser extension, is a long shot for the 2016 Republican nomination."}
