Anderson, a professor in the Department of Health Policy and Management and the Department of International Health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, Md., and Ge Bai an assistant professor in accounting at Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Va.\n\nThey analyzed data from the 2012 Medicare cost reports and found that the 50 hospitals that have the highest mark-up of all 5,000 hospitals in the United States, have mark-ups about 10 times their Medicare-allowable costs compared to a national average of 3.4 percent. Crozer had the 12th highest mark-up rate in the country at 1,010 percent and was the 17th United States hospital listed among the top 50 whose mark-up rates ranged from 920 to 1,260 percent.\n\nUninsured patients at these hospitals are charged, on the average, $1,000 for what costs the hospitals $100.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere is no justification for these outrageous rates, but no one tells hospitals they can\u2019t charge them,\u201d said Anderson.\n\nWhile West Virginia and Maryland officials set limits on hospital mark-ups, there is no federal regulation to protect all Americans.\n\nGrant Gegwich, vice president of Public Relations and Marketing for Crozer-Keystone Health System, acknowledged that Crozer-Keystone Health System has had \u201ca historically high charge structure.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt does not mean, however, that we are receiving high or unreasonable payments from consumers or insurers,\u201d said Gegwich. \u201cThe report focuses on charges, not the more meaningful payment data. Unfortunately, payments from Medicare do not even cover the costs of caring for our patients.\u201d\n\nHe noted that in fiscal year 2015, Crozer-Keystone provided more than $25 million in financial assistance and charity care.\n\nAccording to the study abstract: \u201cWhile most public and private health insurers do not use hospital charges to set their payment rates, uninsured patients are commonly asked to pay the full charges and out-of-network patients and casualty and workers\u2019 compensation insurers are often expected to pay a large portion of the full charges.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, noted Anderson and Bai, hospitals\u2019 high mark-ups can mean higher premiums for privately insured, in-network patients because the hospitals\u2019 high mark-ups are often used by hospitals as leverage to negotiate higher prices with private insurance companies.\n\nThe high hospital charge-to-cost ratio study comes less than a month after the release of a study by Families USA. It revealed that one out of three lower- to middle-income adults do not go for medical tests, treatments and follow-up care because they cannot afford the high out-of-pocket costs.\n\nThe report also noted, \u201cNot getting follow-up care to treat an illness or not taking needed medications can result in people facing avoidable, more serious health problems and more expensive health care costs down the road.\u201d\n\nUtilizing data collected by the Urban Institute\u2019s Health Reform Monitoring Survey in September 2013, September 2014 and December 2014, the Families USA report notes that more than half (50.6 percent) of adults had high deductibles of $1,500 or more, and 30 percent had exceedingly high deductibles of $3,000 or more.\n\nThe inflated hospital mark-ups and the exorbitant out-of-pocket costs health insurance companies now charge subscribers, are a vicious cycle that has been ongoing in the United States for decades, ever since the health care delivery system became big business. Hospital officials mark-up charges because they know insurers will only pay a portion of the costs. Insurance executives jack up premiums and out-of-pocket costs so they can still prove profitable after reimbursing subscribers for care. Now that they are required by the U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to fully cover certain preventive services and that they cannot turn away patients with pre-existing conditions, they are burdening subscribers with such inventions as \u201cco-insurance\u201d when they actually become sick.\n\nEnding this vicious cycle should be a priority of federal legislators instead of trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Health care will not truly be reformed until Americans are spared the cost of big business.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Opinion, Opinion news, Primos Opinion news, PA Opinion news, US Opinion news, world Opinion news.", "title": "Editorial: Big business makes health care costly", "og": {"url": "http://www.delcotimes.com/article/DC/20150614/NEWS/150619801", "image": {"width": "600px", "identifier": "http://local.delcotimes.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/delcotimes.png?052016", "height": "600px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Editorial: Big business makes health care costly"}, "twitter": {"domain": "delcotimes.com", "description": "Last week, a study was published in Health Affairs, a journal of health policy thought and research, that gave Crozer-Chester Medical Center in Upland the dubious distinction of being among the 50 United States hospitals with the highest charge-to-cos", "title": "Editorial: Big business makes health care costly", "url": "http://www.delcotimes.com/article/DC/20150614/NEWS/150619801", "image": {"src": "http://local.delcotimes.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/delcotimes.png?052016"}, "site": "@delcotimes", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id563336340", "iphone": "id508962453", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.thedelawarecountydailytime"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Opinion, Opinion news, Primos Opinion news, PA Opinion news, US Opinion news, world Opinion news.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "Last week, a study was published in Health Affairs, a journal of health policy thought and research, that gave Crozer-Chester Medical Center in Upland the dubious distinction of being among the 50 United States hospitals with the highest charge-to-cos"}, "article_summary": "Health care will not truly be reformed until Americans are spared the cost of big business.\nThe inflated hospital mark-ups and the exorbitant out-of-pocket costs health insurance companies now charge subscribers, are a vicious cycle that has been ongoing in the United States for decades, ever since the health care delivery system became big business.\nWhile West Virginia and Maryland officials set limits on hospital mark-ups, there is no federal regulation to protect all Americans.\nThe high hospital charge-to-cost ratio study comes less than a month after the release of a study by Families USA.\nEnding this vicious cycle should be a priority of federal legislators instead of trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act."}
