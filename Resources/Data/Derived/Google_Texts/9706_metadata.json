I\u2019ll sit down with John Boehner, I\u2019ll sit down with Mitch McConnell, we\u2019ll negotiate, we\u2019ll come up with some compromises, thanks very much for what you did,\u2019\u201d Sanders said. \u201cI will not make that mistake. The point that I\u2019m making is, and this is where my campaign is very different from the others, I do not believe that any president who is standing up for the working class of this country can be successful without the mobilized activist grassroots movement behind him or her. So I will be working hard to make sure that mobilization exists.\u201d\n\nAs for Clinton, Sanders expressed bewilderment that the former Secretary of State hasn\u2019t publicly chosen sides in the trade debate with hours to go before a House vote on fast-track trade authority that the activist left has made defeating as its number one goal.\n\n\u201cYou can be for the [Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal], I think the president is dead wrong, he is for it,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cYou can be against it, I\u2019m against it, Warren\u2019s against it, Sherrod Brown\u2019s against it, the majority of Democrats in the Senate are against it. You can be for it, or against it. I don\u2019t understand how on an issue of such huge consequence, you don\u2019t have an opinion.\u201d\n\nClinton has been playing it very cautiously on the president\u2019s trade agenda, avoiding directly pitting herself against either Obama or his progressive opponents.\n\n\u201cThere are questions being raised about this agreement. It hasn\u2019t been negotiated yet,\u201d Clinton said on the trail in Iowa recently. \u201cI have said I want to judge the final agreement.\u201d\n\nSanders also spoke of big marches on Washington by students demanding a better deal on college costs and marches by workers demanding an increase in the minimum wage.\n\nSanders\u2019 Obama history is a little off, though his tactical critiques are often raised by liberals. Obama turned his campaign into first Organizing for America and then Organizing For Action, nonprofits whose goal in part was to keep Obama\u2019s campaign infrastructure in place for the reelect but also to use his massive list of supporters to pressure Congress via online campaigns and public rallies. Large OFA marches and rallies, feared by some of Obama\u2019s opponents after he won in 2008, never really materialized, although digital campaigns in support of the president\u2019s policies are still blasted out of OFA\u2019s Chicago headquarters on a regular basis.\n\nSanders has done well in his opening weeks as a candidate, amassing, he said, more than 200,000 small-dollar donors and racking up poll numbers that make him number two in the Democratic nomination contest, albeit one running far behind the frontrunner Clinton. Sanders said he\u2019s in it to win it, and promised an increase in poll numbers as his name ID increases. He also promised to be outpspent by the impressive financial operations of Clinton. On the whole, he was comfortable in the role of pugnacious underdog, dismissing the Democratic Party\u2019s plan for primary debates and promising to open discussions with the party chair and his fellow candidates about how best to build a debate calendar.\n\nThe Washington event, a breakfast sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor, came just a day after Sanders\u2019 appearance on the Diane Rehm Show, a syndicated public radio program. Sanders said he forgave Rehm for her question about joint Israeli-American citizenship, a longstanding and wholly incorrect conspiracy theory labeled anti-Semitic by some Jewish groups in the hours after Rehm\u2019s broadcast.\n\n\u201cI like Diane Rehm. She is a good radio interviewer,\u201d he said. \u201cI suspect what happens is her staff gives her a list of questions and someone screwed up pretty bad.\u201d\n\nSanders was asked to weigh in on how his relationship with Judaism affects his political outlook.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud to be Jewish, I\u2019m not particularly religious,\u201d he said. He said growing up Jewish in the post-World War II years taught him elections like the one that put Adolf Hitler in office can have very serious consequences.\n\n\u201cThe lesson that I learned as a little kid was to understand in a very deep way what politics is about,\u201d he said.\n\nReporters also wanted to know a lot about Sanders\u2019 opinion of Europe. Sanders has long called for Western European-style social safety nets, universal healthcare programs, and structures that make higher education free or next to free for most students. America has a lot to learn from Europe, Sanders said. A reporter asked if he thinks Europe has much to learn from America.\n\n\u201cAs a former mayor, what mayors look at is the concept of best practice. What best practices means\u2026you look all over the country and you say, \u2018what are other cities doing that would be good?\u2019 and you steal those ideas,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we should be doing as a world. Are we doing things better than other countries? Of course we are, we have a lot to be proud of. We are a very entrepreneurial country, I mean every other day someone is coming up with another great idea, another great invention. We do that probably better than any other country on earth, and people should learn from us.\u201d\n\nBut in terms of protecting and taking care of the needs of working people,\u201d Sanders continued, \u201cwe have a lot to learn from many other countries around the world.\u201d\n\nSanders promised to bring many of those western European-style programs to the United States if he becomes president. Dinging the president again, Sanders said it was time for a more progressive approach than Obamacare.\n\nSanders seemed pleased by his growing standing as the Democratic Party\u2019s progressive-in-chief, a position fueled by a campaign that has lit up the grassroots on the left despite the lack of initial support from many activist left organizations who were until recently pouring all their efforts into trying to cajole Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren into the presidential race. His campaign building steam, Sanders, said he\u2019s been amazed by the DC money machine he\u2019s discovered as he\u2019s emerged as a prominent presidential candidate.\n\n\u201cA lot of people want to make a lot of money off of campaigns,\u201d Sanders said, when asked what he has learned so far. \u201cThere is an entire industry here in Washington, D.C. of folks who are prepared to help you for some extravagant fees.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"bf": {"buzzid": 3804396, "userid": 568833}, "description": "Sanders is happy to be your liberal attack dog...", "copyright": "Copyright 2016 BuzzFeed, Inc.
