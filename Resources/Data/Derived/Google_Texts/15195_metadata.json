Democrats demanded a quick fix.\n\n\u201cThis is taxpayer money on the line,\u201d said Republican Rep. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee. \u201cThe past three weeks of exchange messiness have demonstrated that nobody can be a blind cheerleader for the Affordable Care Act.\u201d The exchange web site launched on Oct. 1 and quickly became hobbled by error messages and bottlenecks, rendering it largely unusable.

Diana DeGette. \u201cThree weeks later, here we are. We\u2019re still hearing reports of significant problems.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor the Affordable Care Act to work, these problems need to be fixed and these problems need to be fixed fast,\u201d she added.\n\nMORE: Traffic Alone Didn\u2019t Crash the Obamacare Site.
