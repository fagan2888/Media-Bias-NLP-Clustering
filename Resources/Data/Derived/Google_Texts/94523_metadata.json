So when we talk about how much we miss Charity Hospital, we sometimes forget what the reality of that was.\u201d\n\nUnlike Charity, where many a New Orleanian was born, University Medical Center will not deliver babies \u2014 another hospital run by its private operator, Touro Infirmary, offers that service. And it will have far fewer beds for psychiatric patients than Charity, which had nearly 100 inpatient beds plus a 40-bed crisis intervention unit. The new hospital will have 60 psychiatric inpatient beds but will use only 38 to start, transferring patients from a facility that had been housing them since the storm.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s grossly inadequate,\u201d said Janet Hays, a community activist whose group, Healing Minds NOLA, has put in a bid to repurpose the old Charity building as a mental health care and research center. \u201cYou see people in psychosis on the streets of New Orleans all the time, especially since Charity was closed, and the jails have become the repository.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nOther proposals for the landmark Huey Long-era building include apartments and retail space. The state and L.S.U. insisted that the building was unusable and unsafe after the storm, even after doctors, nurses and military personnel cleaned it and pumped out the floodwater.\n\nCharity was part of Louisiana\u2019s unique system of state-run public hospitals for the poor and uninsured, many of whom relied exclusively on its emergency department for health care. In 2005, more than 60 percent of the patients at Charity and a much smaller sister hospital were uninsured. This year at Interim L.S.U. Hospital, the temporary replacement for Charity, the number of uninsured has been 37 percent and the number on Medicaid has risen to 36 percent, partly because the private operator has carefully screened patients for eligibility.\n\nMr. Jindal, a Republican running for president, has refused to expand Medicaid to cover more low-income adults under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nUnder its contract with the state, LCMC Health, the private nonprofit operator of University Medical Center, is obligated to provide free or reduced-cost care to all indigent and uninsured patients, \u201csubject to the receipt of the required funding.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSome question whether University Medical Center will be sufficiently focused on that requirement while it is trying to build what its leaders call destination programs to draw more privately insured patients. Even more, they question whether the hospital \u2014 whose chief executive, Cindy Nuesslein, resigned last week to take a new job \u2014 can succeed in drawing in more affluent patients.\n\n\u201cObviously they\u2019re going to try to rebrand it, but many people will still look upon it as the charity hospital and I\u2019m sure its competitors will remind people of that,\u201d said John Kennedy, the state treasurer, a Republican. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to make it work. We don\u2019t have a choice. Is it going to be easy? No.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nBut Dr. Peter DeBlieux, the hospital\u2019s interim chief medical officer, said diversifying the patient mix was crucial to being able to carry on the mission of caring for the indigent. With the Affordable Care Act soon to decrease federal funding for uncompensated care, he said, finding new sources of revenue is imperative.\n\n\u201cThe core of this hospital will remain the same,\u201d said Dr. DeBlieux, who was among those protesting Charity\u2019s closing. \u201cBut to do it fiscally responsibly, then what you should add to that is destination services. We\u2019ll be able to compete, and everybody wins.\u201d\n\nCharity traced its origins to a grant from a French sailor and shipbuilder, Jean Louis, who died in New Orleans in 1735 and left money in his will to finance a hospital for the indigent of the city, then a colony. Charity opened a year later and carried on that mission in a number of different buildings, the last one of which opened in 1939. The new hospital was built with about $642 million in federal emergency management funds, $279 million from the state and $143 million from LCMC. Greg Feirn, LCMC\u2019s president and chief executive, said he expected to fill about 250 of the new hospital\u2019s 446 beds at first, and to gradually increase the patient population as it develops new lines of specialty care.\n\nOfficials at LCMC say it will cost $525 million a year to run the new hospital \u2014 up from $430 million for Interim L.S.U. \u2014 and with no Medicaid expansion here and a precarious state budget, funding will be an annual concern, Mr. Feirn said. The state faced a significant budget shortfall this year, and it initially provided $113 million less than LCMC said it needed to open the new hospital.\n\nThe money came through in the final budget passed by the Legislature in June, but problems remain elsewhere in the system, including a bitter contract dispute between L.S.U. and the private operator running two state hospitals in northern Louisiana. A bigger problem, Mr. Kennedy said, is that the agreements between the private operators and the state rely too heavily on the federal uncompensated care funds that will soon be cut.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very worried about the costs,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Kennedy and others here still regret that Charity\u2019s huge Art Deco building was not quickly reopened after its basement flooded in the days after the hurricane to at least temporarily serve traumatized residents. Dr. DeBlieux said it was \u201cdespicable\u201d that people had to seek care in tents long after the storm. But with the new hospital, he said, \u201cwe have an opportunity now to do it infinitely better\u201d than at Charity.\n\n\u201cIs this worth the price our patients had to pay?\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s far too complex a question for me to answer.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20150801112442, "twitter": {"description": "Charity Hospital, which was ruined by
