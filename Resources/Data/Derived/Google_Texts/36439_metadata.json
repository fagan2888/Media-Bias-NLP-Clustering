At this event Michael Grieve, the chairman of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, which has financed the King challenge, infamously said of the ACA: \u201cThis bastard has to be killed as a matter of political hygiene. I do not care how this is done, whether it\u2019s dismembered, whether we drive a stake through its heart, whether we tar and feather it and drive it out of town, whether we strangle it. I don\u2019t care who does it, whether it\u2019s some court some place, or the United States Congress. Any which way, any dollar spent on that goal is worth spending, any brief filed toward that end is worth filing, any speech or panel contribution toward that end is of service to the United States.\u201d\n\nThat was December 2010, months before the IRS affirmed its understanding that the law actually provides subsidies through all exchanges. Its rule is now at issue in King, but before the IRS issued it, conservatives pondered attacking the conditioned subsidies from a different angle.\n\nCredit for identifying the five-word phrase at the heart of the legal challenge goes to a lawyer named Thomas Christina, an associate deputy attorney general under President Ronald Reagan. Unlike today\u2019s conservatives, he allowed for the narrow possibility that his interpretation was incorrect\u2014or at least the outgrowth of a legislative snafu. \u201cThis could be an unintended consequence,\u201d he explained in his AEI presentation. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to really know much until at least the spring of next year when there are proposed regs. But the lesson appears to be that there will be no tax credits for taxpayers who live in non-capitulating states, which is really quite extraordinary.\u201d\n\nExtraordinary not because it traced a path by which Republican governors could destroy the law sitting on their hands, but because it was too coercive and thus vulnerable to a Constitutional challenge.\n\n\u201cThis is dangling cash in front of voters,\u201d Christina said. \u201cI mean, really, you will end up in exactly the same place, whether you knuckle under or not, with one important difference, which is you won\u2019t get re-elected if you turn down free money that might otherwise have been paid in the form of tax credits to your citizens. Nobody would be foolish enough to pick door number one. That I think\u2014it fits very comfortably in what I\u2019ve posited is this non-interference principle.\u201d\n\nFor a time, Jonathan Adler\u2014one of the conservative lawyers most closely associated with the subsidy challenge\u2014bought into this line. He wrote that \u201cunder most conditional spending statutes, states may risk losing direct financial support if they fail to follow federal dictates. Here, however, it is state citizens who lose a financial benefit if their state does not act. This structure could create potential coercion concerns insofar as the Dole test focuses on whether the relevant conditions \u2018interfere[] with the state\u2019s sovereign accountability.\u2019\u201d\n\nOnly when the IRS announced it would issue subsidies universally did Adler and his partner-in-crime Michael Cannon\u2014a Cato Institute libertarian\u2014change course. Where conservatives once argued the subsidy condition might be unconstitutionally coercive, they set about to force the government to make good on that very coercion. For a time, Cannon treated their reading of the law as the result of a \u201cglitch.\u201d Eventually the difficulty of undoing the ACA by exploiting a \"glitch\" dawned on them.\n\n\u201cThese things really succeed only if they are accompanied by a political strategy,\" Christina said at the AEI conference. \"It\u2019s one thing to sort of shoot down a particular law on what might be viewed by some as a technicality. It\u2019s quite another to bring one of these cases that really changes the public\u2019s attitude toward the topic as a whole\u2026. [I]f there is a way to frame a case in a way that really can\u2019t be spun by opponents as a way to repeal the New Deal, I think that would be a great plus.\u201d\n\nA \u201cglitch\u201d or \u201ctechnicality\u201d wasn\u2019t good enough. To get their argument off the ground, and keep it airborne, they needed to fabricate a new legislative and political history of the Affordable Care Act. At this juncture, more even-keeled activists might have backed off, recognizing that a legal case draped in a tissue of lies would risk ruin. Instead, they jumped in with both feet.\n\nBut revising history was only half the challenge. They needed plaintiffs\u2014people who would claim to have been wronged by free government money, tendered unlawfully. Their theory wedded them to a peculiar category of potential plaintiffs. Individuals whose antipathy to Obamacare runs so deep they prefer to go uninsured than to use the subsidies, and who hope to quash the subsidies in court so that they can qualify for an exemption from the penalty for lacking coverage. Employers who not only refuse to provide their employees with insurance, but will sue to prevent them from obtaining an exchange subsidy, because that\u2019s what triggers the law\u2019s employer mandate penalty. As University of Michigan law professor Nicholas Bagley put it a year ago, this isn't exactly \"employer-of-the-month award\" material.\n\n\n\nNow we learn that at least three of the four individuals who agreed to join the case don't even fit the bill. But the question isn\u2019t whether people who genuinely reside in these categories have legal standing\u2014under the convoluted theory the challengers have presented, they would. They just aren\u2019t a sympathetic class of victims, like same-sex couples whose marriages will likely soon be recognized everywhere in the United States. They're extreme outliers. Two years ago, Cannon tried to recruit former Cato interns\u2014young people who might play better for the cameras\u2014to join the case. Apparently he came up empty. As judge Andre Davis of the fourth circuit court of appeals told the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney in King: \u201cNobody wants what you\u2019re after here!\u201d\n\nAlmost nobody anyhow.
