A similar resolution has yet to be introduced in the U.S. Senate.\n\nKansas is one of nine states that have passed legislation in support of forming a health care compact if Congress were to authorize one. The other states are Alabama, Georgia, Indiana, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas and Utah.\n\n\u201cThe resolution, essentially, would let states start the process for forming a compact,\u201d said Curtis Ellis, a spokesman for Competitive Governance Action, a Houston-based organization that drafted much of the language in the health care compact and is lobbying for its adoption.\n\nPompeo\u2019s support for the resolution is cited in a recent Competitive Governance Action fundraising letter. Introduced in May, the proposed resolution last week had six co-sponsors, including Pompeo, Ellis said.\n\nThe resolution\u2019s initial sponsor, U.S. Rep. Doug Collins, a Republican from Georgia, has called Obamacare \u201can economic and legal disaster.\u201d He said he introduced the resolution \u201cto restore states\u2019 power over policy decisions that Washington bureaucrats have claimed for themselves.\"\n\nBryan Fisher, a spokesman for Families USA, a national organization that has been outspoken in its support of the Affordable Care Act, said the resolution won\u2019t get far.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a serious piece of legislation,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cIt needs 217 to pass the House, just like the other 50-some efforts to repeal the ACA have had. They go nowhere in the Senate and would be vetoed by the president.\u201d\n\nFor 2015, nearly 70,000 Kansans used federal tax subsidies to purchase health insurance on the ACA marketplace, healthcare.gov.\n\nThough Gov. Sam Brownback and GOP leadership in the Kansas House and Senate have expressed support for joining the compact, the proposal\u2019s potential effect on Medicare and Medicaid has generated controversy in Kansas.\n\n\u201cWe are opposed to any attempts to undermine or tear down the Affordable Care Act, which is what the compact would do,\u201d said Mary Tritsch, a spokesperson for AARP Kansas. \u201cIt would threaten Kansans\u2019 access to affordable health care and, we believe, it would dismantle Medicare, which around 450,000 Kansas have come to rely on.\u201d\n\nBut Ellis said there\u2019s little chance of that happening because few state lawmakers would be willing to tamper with Medicare.\n\nThe health care compact in and of itself does not require anything to be changed. Not Medicare, not Medicaid, not anything.\n\n\u201cThe health care compact in and of itself does not require anything to be changed,\u201d he said. \u201cNot Medicare, not Medicaid, not anything. That would totally be up to the discretion of the state legislature.\u201d\n\nEllis said he was \u201centirely confident\u201d that older Kansans would be quick in telling their legislators to leave Medicare alone and that legislators would heed their constituents\u2019 wishes.\n\n\u201cIf people in Kansas want to keep Medicare the way it is, they can,\u201d he said. \u201cBut maybe people in Kansas who\u2019re under 65 would want to do something different than the Affordable Care Act? They would be free to make those changes while leaving Medicare untouched.\u201d\n\nEllis said Competitive Governance Action disagrees with a legal opinion that Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach recently shared in a letter to congressional representatives in the nine states that have endorsed forming a health care compact.\n\nIn his letter, Kobach argued that if Congress approves the health care compact, states would not have to wait on President Barack Obama\u2019s approval.\n\n\u201cOur position is that this would constitute the redistribution of federal dollars and would require the president\u2019s signature,\u201d Ellis said.\n\nSheldon Weisgrau, director of the Health Reform Resource Project for the Kansas Association for the Medically Underserved, has followed the health care compact debate.\n\n\u201cThe real issue here isn\u2019t so much about what happens in Congress, it\u2019s what our Legislature and our governor would do if Congress and the president were to agree to there being a compact,\u201d he said.\n\nThat discussion, he said, hasn\u2019t taken place yet because \u201cno one thinks this is real. It\u2019s political symbolism on the part of people who see the Affordable Care Act \u2014 the individual mandate in particular \u2014 as an overreach on the government\u2019s part.\u201d\n\nIf the nine states were to form a health compact, the in-state discussions on health care reform, Weisgrau said, would be far more complicated than most legislators realize.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an issue that\u2019s being underplayed by both sides,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause, frankly, no one wants to have that discussion.\u201d\n\nDave Ranney is a reporter for KHI News Service in Topeka.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health", "description": "Kansas 4th District Congressman Mike Pompeo has agreed to co-sponsor a joint resolution that would allow states to form a health care compact and,", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://kmuw.org/post/pompeo-agrees-co-sponsor-health-care-compact-resolution", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/kmuw/files/styles/medium/public/201507/mike_pompeo.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Kansas 4th District Congressman Mike Pompeo has agreed to co-sponsor a joint resolution that would allow states to form a health care compact and,", "title": "Pompeo Agrees To Co-Sponsor Health Care Compact Resolution"}, "org_id": 0, "twitter": {"site": "@kmuw", "card": "summary"}, "author": "Dave Ranney", "wordCount": 927, "dc": {"title": "Pompeo Agrees To Co-Sponsor Health Care Compact Resolution"}, "nid": 54524, "datePublished": "2015-07-28", "story_id": 427114318, "keywords": "government, Mike Pompeo, Affordable Care Act, Obamacare", "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Kansas 4th District Congressman Mike Pompeo has agreed to co-sponsor a joint resolution that would allow states to form a health care compact and, potentially, circumvent parts of the Affordable Care Act.\n\u201cThe health care compact in and of itself does not require anything to be changed,\u201d he said.\nIn his letter, Kobach argued that if Congress approves the health care compact, states would not have to wait on President Barack Obama\u2019s approval.\nThe health care compact in and of itself does not require anything to be changed.\nSheldon Weisgrau, director of the Health Reform Resource Project for the Kansas Association for the Medically Underserved, has followed the health care compact debate."}
