(Official White House Photo by Pete Souza)\n\nYesterday, President Obama visited the DreamWorks Animation Campus in Glendale, California, where he spoke about the economy before an audience of nearly 2,000 Dreamworks employees, including CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg.\n\nThe President began by calling entertainment \"one of America's biggest exports\" -- and, in some ways, a part of American diplomacy:\n\nIt\u2019s part of what makes us exceptional, part of what makes us such a world power. You can go anywhere on the planet and you\u2019ll see a kid wearing a \u201cMadagascar\u201d T-shirt. You can say, \u201cMay the Force be with you\u201d -- they know what you\u2019re talking about. Hundreds of millions of people may never set foot in the United States, but thanks to you, they\u2019ve experienced a small part of what makes our country special. They\u2019ve learned something about our values. We have shaped a world culture through you.\n\nHe then reflected on the significant economic progress that we've made over the past several years: including reining in spending after years of trillion-dollar deficits, changing the tax code to be fairer toward middle-class Americans, winding down two wars, and creating 7.8 million new jobs over the past 44 months -- all the while cutting our deficits by more than half.\n\nJeffrey Katzenburg, third from left, listens with others as President Barack Obama delivers remarks on the economy to employees at the DreamWorks Animation SKG movie studio in Glendale, Calif., Nov. 26, 2013.

(Official White House Photo by Pete Souza)\n\nEven so, the President noted, we could likely have come even further if there were less dysfunction and obstruction in Washington.\n\nWe would be a lot further along if we could just get folks to act with some sense ... if we didn\u2019t have one wing of one party that was a little less obsessed with repealing health care for 40 million people, more concerned with making sure the law works. If they hadn't spent 40 votes trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act, they might have actually taken some votes on rebuilding our infrastructure, or instituting early childhood education for young people across this country, or investing more money in basic research that helps to create the amazing technologies that many of you utilize. Any of the serious proposals I've put forward that would be creating jobs right now, they could have been taking votes on that.\n\nAnd speaking of health care, the President noted that reform is currently at work in Southern California and across the country, noting that 350,000 Californians have already signed up.\n\nThanks in part to the Affordable Care Act, health care costs are growing at the slowest rate in 50 years. Employer-based health care costs are growing at about one-third the rate of a decade ago. And that means that if the studios here or your employers aren't having to spend as much on health care, they can hire more folks and reinvest more in the business, and come up with those cool technologies that -- I don\u2019t exactly understand how they work, but were really neat to look at.\n\nThe President closed by reiterating his call for politicians in Washington to set politics aside in the name of passing laws that will make life for millions of Americans fundamentally better.\n\n\u2026We may have different ideas and different policies on how to do things, but that shouldn\u2019t negate that that core vision is what we're fighting for, and we should be able to sit down together and to keep dreaming and keep working, and to make sure that the American Dream that's been described here in Southern California is sustained for generations to come.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/profiles/forall/themes/custom/fortyfour/browserconfig.xml", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "application-name": "Whitehouse", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/profiles/forall/themes/custom/fortyfour/images/fortyfour/favicons/mstile-310x150.png", "twitter": {"title": "\"Keep Dreaming and Keep Working\": President Obama Speaks About the Economy in Southern California", "url": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/11/27/keep-dreaming-and-keep-working-president-obama-speaks-about-economy-southern-califor", "image": {"src": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/images/twitter_cards_blog.jpg", "height": 240, "width": 240}, "creator": "@WhiteHouse", "site": "@WhiteHouse", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#003C80", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/profiles/forall/themes/custom/fortyfour/images/fortyfour/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/profiles/forall/themes/custom/fortyfour/images/fortyfour/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "og": {"site_name": "whitehouse.gov", "description": "President Obama visited the DreamWorks Animation Campus in Glendale, California, on Tuesday, where he spoke about the economy before an audience of hundreds of Dreamworks employees, including CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg.", "title": "\"Keep Dreaming and Keep Working\": President Obama Speaks About the Economy in Southern California", "url": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/11/27/keep-dreaming-and-keep-working-president-obama-speaks-about-economy-southern-califor", "image": {"width": 240, "secure_url": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/images/twitter_cards_blog.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "identifier": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/images/twitter_cards_blog.jpg", "height": 240}, "updated_time": "2015-08-12T19:02:18-04:00", "type": "article"}, "MobileOptimized": "width", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/profiles/forall/themes/custom/fortyfour/images/fortyfour/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-27T11:18:11-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-12T19:02:18-04:00"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/profiles/forall/themes/custom/fortyfour/images/fortyfour/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Thanks in part to the Affordable Care Act, health care costs are growing at the slowest rate in 50 years.\nPresident Barack Obama delivers remarks on the economy to employees at the DreamWorks Animation SKG movie studio in Glendale, Calif., Nov. 26, 2013.\nAnd speaking of health care, the President noted that reform is currently at work in Southern California and across the country, noting that 350,000 Californians have already signed up.\nEmployer-based health care costs are growing at about one-third the rate of a decade ago.\n(Official White House Photo by Pete Souza)Yesterday, President Obama visited the DreamWorks Animation Campus in Glendale, California, where he spoke about the economy before an audience of nearly 2,000 Dreamworks employees, including CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg."}
