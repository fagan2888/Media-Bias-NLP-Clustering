Ward said yesterday he wanted the Broncos\u2019 secondary to lead the league in interceptions. He wasted no time playing his part in the pursuit Sunday. The Pro Bowl safety had two picks on the day, including a pick-six off a Peyton Manning pass during team drills. The second came toward the end of practice, when quarterback Zac Dysert gift-wrapped him a ball from that resembled a weak pop-out fielded by a shortstop. Ward wasn\u2019t the only one in the secondary making plays. Cornerback Curtis Marsh added an interception while Lorenzo Doss and Aqib Talib each made impressive pass deflections.\n\nLOWLIGHT: Brandon McManus got the full load at kicker on Sunday and didn\u2019t impress. The Broncos\u2019 kickoff specialist went 2-for-4 on field-goal attempts with misses from 37 and 51 yards out. He made attempts from 37 and 48 yards. But 50 percent isn\u2019t going to cut it for a NFL kicker and McManus can\u2019t count on the Broncos keeping three specialists again this season. He\u2019s likely competing with Connor Barth, who got the day off, for one spot.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to give them a right down the middle competitive situation,\u201d coach Gary Kubiak said.\n\nPOSITION BATTLE: For the second day in a row, Ryan Harris took first-team reps at right tackle. \u201cWe have a plan in place so that the reps are going to come out even. We have some decisions to make here down the road,\u201d Kubiak said.\n\nHarris, who is on his third stint with the Broncos, performed well Sunday and didn\u2019t back to down when defensive end Derek Wolfe initiated a skirmish during team drills.\n\nINJURY UPDATE: Tight end Marcel Jensen couldn\u2019t practice Sunday after experiencing soreness from being stepped on Saturday. Kubiak expects him to return to practice Monday. Defensive ends Malik Jackson (calf) and Antonio Smith and running back Jeremy Stewart (hamstring) participated in limited drills.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Broncos training camp Day 3: Highlights, lowlights, more", "title": "Broncos training camp Day 3: Highlights, lowlights, more", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/08/02/broncos-training-camp-day-3-highlights-lowlights-more/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-02T14:40:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-02T14:40:13+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0d2a\"", "article_summary": "POSITION BATTLE: For the second day in a row, Ryan Harris took first-team reps at right tackle.\nHIGHLIGHT: T.J.
