The Right shouldn\u2019t follow suit.\n\nThere is a question that all of us need to ask. How we respond makes all the difference in what type of life we lead and what type of world we make.\n\nThat question is: Does an action feel good or do good?\n\nLet me give three areas of examples: personal life; the Left; and, most recently, unfortunately, the Right.\n\nIn the personal sphere, many parents, especially in this last generation, have done what feels good rather than what does good.\n\nIt feels good to give one\u2019s children what they want, but it rarely does good. It feels good to build children\u2019s self-esteem \u2014 giving them trophies for no achievement, for example \u2014 but when the self-esteem is unearned, it doesn\u2019t do good. It feels good to provide one\u2019s adult children with money and other material benefits when they should be providing for themselves, but it doesn\u2019t do good. And it feels good to coddle children rather than discipline them. But, same deal: It\u2019s not good for them.\n\nIn the social and political spheres, feeling good rather than doing good has characterized virtually every left-wing policy.\n\nLiberals feel good (especially about themselves \u2014 remember, the Left founded the self-esteem movement) when they promote race-based affirmative action. Given the centuries of suffering blacks endured in America, it feels good to change rules of admission in order to have more blacks attend more prestigious colleges. The problem is that these policies have done considerably more harm than good to blacks (and to society). The black dropout rate at many colleges is much higher than that of non-blacks; and many black students feel resentful while at college, believing that, because of affirmative action, they are frequently not regarded by other students as equals. But to progressives, none of that matters. What matters is that they themselves feel good.\n\nFor more than half a century liberals have felt good (again, in large measure about themselves) while giving ever-increasing unearned benefits to poorer Americans. That these policies have led to an unprecedented percentage of Americans dependent on \u2014 and often becoming addicted to \u2014 state handouts in no way disturbs progressives, because these policies make progressives feel good.\n\nLooking at the welfare state, we find another example of the left-wing propensity for feeling good. Over the long run, the welfare state must fail, as it\u2019s doing in nearly all of Europe. But creating such a state and doing so by \u201ctaxing the rich\u201d feels good, even while it doesn\u2019t do good. There simply aren\u2019t enough rich people. Likewise, there are not enough young workers to support retirees. But giving away money \u2014 especially when it\u2019s someone else\u2019s \u2014 feels good.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare, is a classic example of feeling good rather than doing good. Progressives feel good about insuring uninsured Americans. That the government would begin to take over another one-sixth of the American economy; that the law consists of 2,500 pages (and its regulations already run into an additional tens of thousands of pages); that this is the first piece of major American social legislation to be passed without one vote from the opposition party; that doctors and hospitals will be paid less; that more doctors will retire or take only private patients; that medical devices needed for Americans\u2019 health will be further taxed; that companies will relegate vast numbers of workers to part-time work \u2014 none of this matters. What matters is that progressives feel good about the ACA.\n\nAnd now, sadly, we have witnessed this most seductive human frailty \u2014 feeling good as opposed to doing good \u2014 within the conservative movement, the movement that prides itself as placing doing good before feeling good.\n\nRepublicans and conservatives achieved nothing \u2014 and did themselves substantial harm \u2014 when the House passed legislation that demanded the defunding of Obamacare as a condition of further funding the government and perhaps even raising the debt ceiling.\n\nI have not read a convincing argument on behalf of these tactics. But I have read polls showing that the Republican party is held in lower esteem than at any time in its history.\n\nAnd any Republican who dismisses such polls ought to recall that the polls, not wishful-thinking Republicans, were right in predicting that Obama would win reelection.\n\nConservatives who supported the doomed repeal-Obamacare-tactic argue that it, and Senator Ted Cruz\u2019s filibuster, brought national attention to Obamacare\u2019s deficiencies. In reality, it only brought attention to the Republican party\u2019s deficiencies.\n\nThe primary reason for this tactic was that it made many conservatives feel good: \u201cWe need to stand up for what we believe,\u201d even if we know in advance that it will fail to accomplish the stated goal. Bismarck, father of the modern welfare state, is credited with saying, \u201cPolitics is the art of the possible.\u201d His side seems to understand that better than ours does.\n\nMy fellow conservatives fell into the very human \u2014 and very leftist \u2014 trap of asking what feels good rather than what does good. In politics, the only thing that should feel good is winning.\n\n\u2014 Dennis Prager is a nationally syndicated radio talk-show host and columnist.
