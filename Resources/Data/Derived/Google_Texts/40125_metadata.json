I think I took pretty good shots today.\u201d\n\nHe also was making good choices passing the ball to the open man, combining with fellow guard Spencer Dinwiddie for 12 of Colorado\u2019s 23 assists on 28 made baskets.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a credit to my teammates for finishing plays,\u201d Booker said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t do that without them. The bench came in, they shared the ball. Those are things that we need to win. We can\u2019t have the ball sticking in our hands too much. If we do that, we\u2019re easy to guard, but if we move it, we\u2019re hard to guard and we\u2019ll win games like that.\u201d\n\nColorado\u2019s unselfish play figured prominently in the seven players scoring in double figures, the most in a game Tad Boyle\u2019s four years as the Buffaloes\u2019 coach and one shy of the team record. Colorado had eight players in double figures in a game against Iowa State in 1973.\n\n\u201cI thought it was a great showing by our team,\u201d Boyle said. \u201cI was really proud of our guys for playing together. When you have 23 assists on 28 baskets it means you\u2019re playing together. I think this team took a step forward today, but again it\u2019s one game. We can\u2019t get too full of ourselves, but some positive things to build on, for sure.\u201d\n\nXavier Talton and Dustin Thomas scored 13 points apiece for Colorado (3-1), which has won three in a row since a season-opening loss to Baylor.\n\nJaveres Brent led Jackson State, which is in the midst of a five-game road trip, with 20 points. Julysses Nobles added 16 points for the Tigers (1-3).\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think we did a great job of getting back and transitioning, making them play 5 on 5,\u201d said Jackson State coach Wayne Brent. \u201c(The Buffaloes) are really talented but they haven\u2019t shot the ball well, but I thought today, they shot it well.\u201d\n\nUp by 11 at halftime, the Buffaloes opened the second half with 10-4 burst that extended their lead to 56-39.\n\nThe Tigers scored eight of the next 10 points to pull to within 11 again only to see Colorado pull away with another run, punctuated by another 3-pointer by Booker that put the Buffs in front 66-49 with 12:02 left.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Askia Booker leads Colorado past Jackson State 94-70", "title": "Askia Booker leads Colorado past Jackson State 94-70", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/11/16/askia-booker-leads-colorado-past-jackson-state-94-70/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131116_014124_askia-booker.jpg", "height": 371}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131116_014124_askia-booker.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-16T12:24:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T14:57:05+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc3a8\"", "article_summary": "BOULDER, Colo.\u2014Askia Booker picked his spots well when he was shooting the ball and dishing it off to teammates.\nJaveres Brent led Jackson State, which is in the midst of a five-game road trip, with 20 points.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think we did a great job of getting back and transitioning, making them play 5 on 5,\u201d said Jackson State coach Wayne Brent.\n\u201cI got going a little bit today and I thank Coach for that,\u201d Booker said.\nColorado had eight players in double figures in a game against Iowa State in 1973."}
