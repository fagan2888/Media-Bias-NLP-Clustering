In 2002, they purchased the 77-year-old stone church and transformed it into a bistro, flower shop, art gallery and wedding venue.\n\nOn August 3, 2013, a gay couple from Des Moines asked to rent G\u00f6rtz Haus for their wedding.\n\nBecause of their Mennonite faith, the Odgaards told the couple they could not host their wedding.\n\nWithin 24 hours, the couple filed a discrimination complaint through the Iowa Civil Rights Commission.\n\n\u201cWe knew that the business was going to be in trouble almost immediately,\u201d Richard, 69, said. \u201cWe had to get rid of the wedding business to avoid another complaint and possibly a higher penalty.\u201d\n\nThe Odgaards never admitted to any discrimination, but agreed to a $5,000 settlement.\n\nThey also returned two non-refundable deposits for couples who, after hearing media reports, didn\u2019t want to use their space for their weddings anymore.\n\n\u201cIt was just the right thing to do,\u201d Richard said.\n\nGoing On Life Support\n\nAfter leaving the wedding business, G\u00f6rtz Haus went on life support.\n\nIf they continued to offer wedding-related services, the Odgaards knew they could be subject to another discrimination complaint.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have a choice,\u201d Betty, 63 said. \u201cWe would be targets.\u201d\n\nAround town, G\u00f6rtz Haus became known as the business that refuses to serve gays.\n\nIf a group of ladies went to lunch and one disagreed with their opinion not to host same-sex weddings, the entire group boycotted the bistro, the Odgaards explained.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t come in because the people who are against us are more vocal than the people who are in our court,\u201d Richard said.\n\nBetty said the situation drove her into a \u201creally dark depression\u201d\u2014so bad, that she had to seek the help of professionals.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a melancholy artist and no stranger to depression, but this took me down to the darkest I\u2019ve ever been before,\u201d she said.\n\nThe case was the first of its kind in Iowa, but it didn\u2019t receive the same sort of media attention as the bakers in Oregon, the photographers in New Mexico or the farmers in New York.\n\nThe couple says that\u2019s because pending litigation prevented them from being able to speak out, further isolating them from their community.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t get the Chick-fil-A response,\u201d Richard half-heartedly joked.\n\nIowa\u2019s Involvement\n\nThe Odgaards don\u2019t blame the gay community for shutting them down, but rather, the state of Iowa.\n\n\u201cI think if people in Iowa would have had a chance to vote on this, it would have never have been this way. People in Iowa are pretty conservative,\u201d Betty said.\n\n\u201cWith the discrimination laws and the legality of same-sex marriage in this state, now you have to prove that you didn\u2019t discriminate,\u201d added Richard.\n\nThe Odgaards also feel they never got their day in court, and had the case turned out differently, they might not have been driven out of business.\n\n\u201cThis was all administrative judgement,\u201d Richard said. \u201cThe [gay couple] had a platform to file their case and we didn\u2019t get our day in court with a jury of our peers.\u201d\n\nLike the other lawsuits involving charges of discrimination, complaints are filed\u2014and judged\u2014in the Iowa Civil Rights Commission.\n\n\u201cWe knew what the outcome was going to be, the judge knew what the outcome was going to be, but we had to go through it,\u201d Richard said.\n\nOriginally, the gay couple asked for $10,000, but lawyers for the Odgaards at The Becket Fund for Religious Liberty were able to negotiate a settlement for half that amount.\n\n\u201cNow the precedent has been set,\u201d Richard said. \u201cThe administrative process has demonstrated what it will do if this happens, so it\u2019s a matter of setting somebody up and collecting money. It\u2019s that simple. It\u2019s all they have to do.\u201d\n\nMoving On\n\nYesterday, the Odgaards spent the day calling vendors and sharing the news that by the end of August, they\u2019ll be closed completely.\n\n\u201cWe have to look on the positive side, but just telling our family what we are doing, telling vendors the decision that we\u2019ve made, it\u2019s been very tough,\u201d Betty said.\n\nThe couple has decided to take their story and use it to advocate for Christian teachings by creating God\u2019s Original Design Ministry.\n\nWith the ministry, they hope to promote the importance of religious liberty, \u201cregardless of what your religion is,\u201d Richard said.\n\nThey received their nonprofit status earlier than expected, which they took as a sign from God.\n\nAs for the future of G\u00f6rtz Haus, the Odgaards hope that it will return to its original function: a church.\n\n\u201cThat would be the most wonderful option,\u201d Betty said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Charged with discriminating against a gay couple, the owners of another Christian family-run business in Grimes, Iowa are being forced to shut their doors.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Charged with discriminating against a gay couple, the owners of another Christian family-run business in Grimes, Iowa are being forced to shut their doors.", "title": "Christian Business Owners Stopped Hosting All Weddings.
