In October, 44 percent had an unfavorable view and 38 percent had a favorable view.\n\nKaiser has tracked views on the law for four years and the gap between negative and positive views -- at 16 percent -- has only been this wide in October of 2011 when the law was getting a lot of negative attention in the GOP presidential primaries.\n\nThe poll found that about half of the public found that news coverage has been mostly about politics and controversies -- and that fewer than one in 10 people think the coverage has been mostly about how the law will affect people.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome 40 percent say the news coverage has been balanced, two times as many believe the coverage is biased against the law as those who believe its biased in favor -- 33 percent to 17 percent.\n\nThe Kaiser poll summary noted that when Medicare \"Part D\" prescription drug benefit was launched, 50 percent of seniors had an unfavorable view of the program, contrasted with 63 percent now viewing it favorably and just 14 percent unfavorably.\n\n\"Of course, it is far too early to tell what will happen to public opinion on the ACA as it moves through the next phase of implementation, but the Medicare Part D experience suggests that it is not unusual for a new law of this sort to be poorly perceived at the outset,\" Kaiser notes.\n\nRead more about the poll and its methodology here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "affordable care act, news", "title": "Tracking poll: Views of Obamacare shift negative in November", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \" Tracking poll: Views of Obamacare shift negative in November\", \"link\": \"http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2013/11/tracking_poll_views_of_obamaca.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://image.al.com/home/bama-media/width620/img/spotnews/photo/13779561-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11713687\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-11-25T15:56:12Z\", \"author\": \"Mike Oliver | moliver@al.com\", \"tags\": [\"@river-all\",\"affordable care act\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://image.al.com/home/bama-media/width620/img/spotnews/photo/13779561-standard.jpg", "creator": "@MikeOliverAL", "site": "@aldotcom", "card": "summary", "description": "View full sizeAffordable Care Act hits bumpy road.
