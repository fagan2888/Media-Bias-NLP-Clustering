Along with Valentine's Day, February 14th is also National Organ Donor Day.

It's a day to spread awareness about how important organ donations are when it comes to saving lives.

According to organdonor.gov, there are more than 100,000 people on the waiting list to receive an organ donation.

One local woman, who signed up to be an organ donor says it's something she hopes her kids will do one day too.

"I want to make sure my kids know and hopefully when they become older they are able to do the same," explained Margarita Atchley, a registered organ donor. "I think, in the end, it's something you feel good about and if you can do it then go ahead and do it."
