His one hour on stage particularly comes alive because of his band: guitarist, drummer and a congas player.\n\n\n\n2:33pm: Tanlines informs the New York City crowd that they are hard at work on a new album and go on to play a new song. \u201cNo one\u2019s ever heard it \u2014 not even my own family,\u201d admits percussionist Jesse Cohen. \u201cThat\u2019s how close I feel to you all.\u201d 3:40pm: Classix get their biggest ovation of the afternoon, as New York resident Nancy Whang joins them onstage, singing lead vocals on their highly dance-able \u201cAll You\u2019re Waiting For.\u201d 3:44pm: Ten minutes after the crowd packed into the Gotham tent chants his name, Chance the Rapper hits the stage in a Chicago White Sox jersey (over a Superman shirt) to perform his cult-following mixtape hits. 4:45pm: Disclosure brought in a flood of people towards the Honda stage. They kicked off their hour-long set with their Mary J. Blige single, \"Fool For You.\" While Mary herself wasn't there, AlunaGeorge was in the house to perform on \"White Noise\" later in the set. Although sans Sam Smith, their closing song, \"Latch,\" left concertgoers in a good, if not better, mood. 4:58pm: Broken Bells frontman James Mercer earns the crowd\u2019s praise for breaking out the high notes for \u201cThe Ghost Inside,\u201d off the band\u2019s 2010 debut album. 7:04pm: Childish Gambino kicks off his set by singing to an acoustic \"Centipede,\" but switches it up fast with the high-energy \"because the internet single,\" \"Crawl.\" He dances on stage through out the show, and surprises fans when a shirtless Chance the Rapper takes the stage for two of their collaborations: \"Favorite Song\" and \"The Worst Guys.\" Who had one of the best \"seats\" in the house? Outkast's Andre 3000, who watched from the photo pit at the front of the stage.\n\nSwag. RT @its_topp: Apparent Andre 3000 is a @DonaldGlover fan too.

She also reflected on their first ever gig. \"We played our first show at Union Pool in Brooklyn and we played this song - it's our dance party song\", she shared launching into the track \u201cDemons,\u201d her raging vocals blaring on the repeated line \u201cTake it down, take it down, take it down.\u201d\n\n\n\n9:21pm: Spoon earns its biggest ovation of the night for a rousing rendition of \u201cThe Underdog\u201d from its 2007 album, \u201cGa Ga Ga Ga Ga.\u201d\n\n9:35pm: Skrillex feeds a flood of ragers with an hour set of dance-inducing tracks, all while DJing in his spaceship booth, the Mothership. 9:42pm: \u201cY'all feelin all right. If you wanna sing along I'm not gonna get mad at you!\" Jack White joked to the crowd, before launching into fan favorite \u201cHotel Yorba,\u201d a White Stripes song.
