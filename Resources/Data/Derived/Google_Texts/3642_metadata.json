The move comes days after the San Francisco Board of Supervisors increased the legal age to buy tobacco products to 21.\n\nEnding months of stalling on legislation approved last year in the Senate, Assembly Democrats said the measure will prevent young people from taking up smoking. Proponents say it would make it much harder for teens to get access to tobacco because 18-year-old high school students would not be able to buy it for their underage friends.\n\n\u201cThis will save the medical system in the outgoing years millions of dollars,\u201d said Assemblyman Jim Wood, D-Healdsburg. \u201cIt will save thousands of lives.\u201d\n\nA landmark study from the prestigious Institute of Medicine reached a similar conclusion in an analysis published last year. The panel found that if the minimum legal age to buy tobacco were raised to 21 nationwide, tobacco use would drop by 12 percent by the time today\u2019s teens reached adulthood. In addition, there would be 223,000 fewer premature deaths and 50,000 fewer deaths from lung cancer,\n\nRepublicans said the government should not restrict people\u2019s freedom to make their own decisions.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t smoke. I don\u2019t encourage my children to,\u201d said Assemblyman Donald Wagner, R-Irvine. \u201cBut they\u2019re adults, and it\u2019s our job to treat our citizens as adults, not to nanny them.\u201d\n\nThe legal age to purchase alcohol is 21 across the U.S., and most casinos set 21 as the age for gambling. In the four states that have legalized marijuana, 21 is the legal age to purchase.\n\nThe age to purchase tobacco would remain 18 for members of the military.\n\nThe bills also would require that e-cigarettes be regulated like tobacco products, impose new restrictions on workplace smoking and expand tobacco bans to more schools. Counties would be able to raise their own cigarette taxes beyond the state\u2019s levy of $0.87 per pack.\n\nThe bills now return to the Senate, which must approve changes made in the Assembly before the legislation can reach Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown.\n\nLawmakers approved the tobacco legislation in a special session called last year by Brown to restructure taxes on health plans.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The age to purchase all tobacco products, including e-cigarettes, would move from 18 to 21 statewide.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"California Assembly Votes to Raise Smoking Age, Regulate E-Cigarettes\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2016\\/03\\/03\\/california-assembly-votes-to-raise-smoking-age-regulate-e-cigarettes\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2016-03-03 14:31:46\",\"mod_date\":\"2016-03-03 14:34:23\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":156299,\"author_id\":\"8344\",\"author_name\":\"State of Health\",\"author_display_name\":\"State of Health\",\"tags\":[\"E-Cigarettes\",\"News\",\"Tobacco\"],\"categories\":[\"Policy\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2016\\/03\\/iStock_000034018612_Large-e1457044283983.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "The age to purchase all tobacco products, including e-cigarettes, would move from 18 to 21 statewide.", "title": "California Assembly Votes to Raise Smoking Age, Regulate E-Cigarettes", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2016/03/03/california-assembly-votes-to-raise-smoking-age-regulate-e-cigarettes/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2016/03/iStock_000034018612_Large-1440x960.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "e-cigarettes,news,tobacco", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The move comes days after the San Francisco Board of Supervisors increased the legal age to buy tobacco products to 21.\nLawmakers approved the tobacco legislation in a special session called last year by Brown to restructure taxes on health plans.\nIn major victories for anti-tobacco advocates, the California Assembly voted Thursday to raise the smoking age to 21, regulate electronic cigarettes as tobacco products and take a variety of other steps aiming to restrict access to tobacco.\nCalifornia would become just the second state to raise the smoking age from 18, joining the state of Hawaii and dozens of cities around the country that have already moved to the higher limit.\nThe bills also would require that e-cigarettes be regulated like tobacco products, impose new restrictions on workplace smoking and expand tobacco bans to more schools."}
