Steve Stockman, who has perfected the art of congressional trolling, is really bringing Chad Henderson to the State of the Union.\n\nDon\u2019t remember Chad Henderson?\n\nHere\u2019s a refresher: When the Obamacare exchanges officially went live, reporters desperately searched for someone \u2014 anyone \u2014 who had been able to enroll. Henderson, a student at Chattanooga State University, was connected with multiple reporters through Enroll America and gleefully told them he had successfully signed his father and himself up for Obamacare.\n\nThat turned out to be untrue. Henderson had picked out a plan he wanted, but didn\u2019t actually enroll. He argued he had just used the wrong terminology.\n\nEnter Stockman, who a few days later invited Henderson to the State of the Union via a press release calling the college student \u201cpractically a Democrat member of Congress.\u201d\n\n\u201cChad Henderson is Obamacare personified. He pushed Obamacare on other people but refused to buy it himself because he would pay more. He\u2019s practically a Democrat member of Congress,\u201d Stockman said. \u201cI hope Chad will join me at the State of the Union Address so Obama can point to someone who personifies his policies.\u201d\n\nHenderson happily accepted the invitation.\n\nSo Stockman put out another press release stating that now the media \u201cwill have someone they can cut to\u201d when the president talked about Obamacare.\n\nIt might have ended there. But Henderson confirmed Friday that he\u2019s really headed to D.C. for the president\u2019s address to Congress.\n\nAs he told BuzzFeed, he\u2019s paying his own way and his plane tickets and hotel are officially (we think) booked. He says he\u2019s looking forward to talking with Stockman.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re all smart here, I\u2019m not going to pretend that I\u2019m gonna be his friend,\u201d Chad said. \u201cI\u2019m anticipating that he\u2019s going to use me a whipping post and mock me, but I hope I\u2019m wrong and we can all be adults and let me enjoy this honor.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do have some reservations about his motives but there is no way in hell I\u2019d turn something like that down,\u201d he added.\n\nHenderson also said that he\u2019d be making an announcement about his own health care situation prior to the State of the Union. He still describes himself a big supporter of the president\u2019s health care law.\n\n\u201cThe people who called me a fake and phony and mocked me will feel pretty stupid come the 28th,\u201d he said.\n\nThis is not the first time Stockman, who is currently attempting to challenge Sen. John Cornyn\u2019s Senate seat, has grabbed attention for his State of the Union invites. Last year his guest was controversial rocker Ted Nugent, who declared one Democratic congressman had \u201cshit for brains,\u201d and said he felt like \u201ca little girl\u201d for not having his gun on him.", "article_metadata": {"bf": {"buzzid": 2917469, "userid": 686094}, "description": "Chad Henderson, who made news in October for telling the world he had signed up for Obamacare without actually having done so, says...", "copyright": "Copyright 2016 BuzzFeed, Inc.
