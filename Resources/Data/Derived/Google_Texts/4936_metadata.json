In a speech today, Obama took that on.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been listening to President Obama\u2019s speeches with any regularity over the last two years, you\u2019ll be familiar with this afternoon\u2019s address at the Center for American Progress on income inequality and economic mobility. As usual, he notes the growing gap between the rich and everyone else, the deep insecurity of the middle-class, and the disappearance of working-class jobs that can provide a decent quality of life.\n\nThere was, however, something different about this speech relative to all his others. Namely, he zeroed in on one of the key problems liberals have always faced in their efforts to expand the social safety net.\n\nWhite people.\n\nEven today, nearly fifty years after the end of legal segregation, racial attitudes are the most reliable way to predict support for certain government programs. On one end is outright opposition: Whites who show high levels of \u201cethnocentrism,\u201d for instance, are more likely to oppose means-tested welfare\u2014like Temporary Aid for Needy Families (TANF)\u2014even after you adjust for ideology. Likewise, whites who show high levels of \u201cracial resentment\u201d\u2014the belief that blacks and other minorities unfairly benefit at the expense of white Americans\u2014are reliable opponents of government programs for the poor.\n\nIndeed, there\u2019s some evidence to suggest that the Affordable Care Act\u2019s poor approval with white Americans owes itself\u2014in part\u2014to perceptions that the law primarily benefits blacks, Latinos and other non-whites. Arguably, one ad in the 2012 election played on this perception, attacking Obamacare as a program that took billions from \u201cyou\u201d\u2014illustrated as an older white man\u2014to spend on a new government program for unspecified others. What\u2019s more, there is research to show that one ad\u2014which attacked President Obama for \u201cgutting welfare\u201d\u2014had the effect of priming negative racial attitudes towards African Americans.\n\nEven among those who support safety net programs, the level and degree of support is mediated by racial perceptions. \u201cAs whites become more racially resentful,\u201dwrites Oberlin political scientist Christopher DeSante, \u201cthey are less willing to spend money on welfare, but are always willing to spend more on applicants with white names.\u201d\n\nThis fits with a deep well of research which shows that Americans divide welfare recipients into the \u201cdeserving\u201d and the \u201cundeserving.\u201d Thanks to decades of slanted images of black poverty, the broad image is that the black poor are lazy and unwilling to work, while the white poor deserve a break. Phrases like \u201cwelfare queen\u201d and complaints about \u201chandouts\u201d and \u201cObamaphones,\u201d for example, are heavily racialized and dredge up (or use) images of inner-city blacks.\n\nSimply put, beliefs about who benefits are key to public opinion on the social safety net. And judging from his speech, President Obama is more than aware of this, telling the audience that \u201c[T]he decades-long shifts in the economy have hurt all groups, poor and middle class, inner city and rural folks, men and women, and Americans of all races.\u201d\n\nFrom there, he dismisses the idea that these are \u201cexclusively minority concerns,\u201d stating that \u201cThe opportunity gap in America is now as much about class as it is about race,\u201d and that \u201cwe have to reject a politics that suggests any effort to address it in a meaningful way somehow pits the interests of a deserving middle class against those of an undeserving poor in search of handouts.\u201d\n\nNow, it is true\u2014as he points out\u2014that \u201cThe gap in test scores between poor kids and wealthy kids is now nearly twice what it is between white kids and black kids,\u201d and that problems of drug abuse and broken communities have spread beyond the inner cities, to the white working-class. Still, racial inequality exists, even adjusting for income and wealth. Middle-class blacks, for instance, live in neighborhoods that are dramatically poorer than their white counterparts. According to sociologist Patrick Sharkey, \u201cTwo out of three black children born from 1985 through 2000 have been raised in neighborhoods with at least 20 percent poverty, compared to just 6 percent of whites.\u201d For every disadvantage conferred by class, in other words, race multiplies it.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "@jbouie"}, "keywords": "U.S. Politics", "publicationDate": 201312042130, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/voxbox/jamelle-bouie", "description": "The broad based social safety net has always faced skepticism from white voters, who don't want to spend tax dollars on the \"undeserving\" poor.
