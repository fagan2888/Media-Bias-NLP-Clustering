Formerly plodding and defensive to the core, healthcare stocks are having another tremendous year. Indeed, at a time when the S&P 500 has done almost nothing, healthcare stocks are almost single-handedly keeping it positive for the year-to-date.

Healthcare is the best-performing sector of the S&P 500 this year, generating a total return of 11%.

There’s no secret as to why.

Investors have been piling into healthcare stocks ever since the White House starting pushing the Affordable Care Act. The expansion of health insurance coverage is creating millions of new customers for the industry. At the same time, the population is getting older. Those two forces are driving record spending on healthcare, and that’s boosting revenue, earnings and sentiment across the sector.

Sure, as much as broad bets on healthcare stocks have been working out, you always have to worry about valuations getting stretched. Additionally, there’s the headwind of rising interest rates. At some point in the not-too-distant future, the Federal Reserve is going hike, and that’s going to hit smaller stocks — which rely more on debt to grow — than larger ones.

That got us thinking about the best large-cap healthcare stocks to buy in this environment. Large caps tend to be less volatile, for one thing, and should mostly shrug off interest-rate fears.

Additionally, you’re more likely to find value in large caps. They usually have lower growth forecasts because its hard to make really big gains off a large base. That keeps out the greedy money and puts a lid on valuations.
