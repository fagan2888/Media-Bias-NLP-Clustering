It also found that on any given day, about 20 percent of kids eat pizza. According to the study\u2019s authors, pizza is the second-highest source of calories for children after desserts such as cakes and cookies.\n\n\u201cThis is not saying don\u2019t eat pizza,\u201d said study co-author Lisa Powell, director of the Illinois Prevention Research Center and professor of health policy and administration at the University of Illinois at Chicago. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice opportunity for us to make some small changes because it\u2019s such a prevalent item in children\u2019s diets. Hopefully we can make healthy pizza the norm.\u201d\n\nWhile the number of calories children got from pizza decreased around 25 percent between 2003 and 2010, a healthy pizza diet is still far from the norm and the researchers concluded that pizza \u201cconsumption should be curbed and its nutrient content improved.\u201d\n\nFor now, on days when teens eat pizza, they consume an average of 230 extra calories, and children consume 84 extra calories on average. On these days, pizza composes 22 percent of children\u2019s calories and 26 percent of teens\u2019 calories. When eaten as a snack and not a meal, teens ate an additional 365 calories compared with days they snacked on other things, and children ate an extra 202 calories.\n\nThese additional calorie intakes are in-line with what happens when kids eat fast food.\n\nThe authors of the study recommend that physicians and pediatricians discuss pizza consumption with parents during nutritional discussions. They believe that focusing on specific foods rather than overall nutrients my be more effective dietary counseling.\n\n\u201cThese observations emphasize that pizza, like sugary drinks, may be a significant contributor to excess caloric intake and obesity, and should become a target for counseling for the prevention and treatment of obesity in pediatric practice,\u201d they wrote in the study.\n\nIncreasing awareness of the health and dietary impacts of food has caused large pizza chains like Domino\u2019s and Pizza Hut to introduce lower fat, lower sodium, and lower calorie options. But they are reluctant to sacrifice taste in any way.\n\n\u201cWe constantly look for ways to make our products \u2018better\u2019 without sacrificing taste,\u201d said Domino\u2019s Pizza company spokesman Tim McIntyre.\n\nOne alternative to better keep track of ingredients is to make your own pizza, according to Alexis Tindall, a clinical dietitian with the Center for Healthy Weight & Nutrition at Nationwide Children\u2019s Hospital in Columbus, Ohio. Doing this allows for the selection of healthier toppings, less cheese, and lower-sodium sauce. This switch will not come easy as part of pizza\u2019s popularity is its pervasiveness; it is often served at school, at parties or other gatherings, or when it\u2019s just the cheapest and easiest option available.\n\nCongress, for its part, has played its familiar role of catering to lobbying pressures. In 2011, Congress blocked rules proposed by the U.S. Agriculture Department that would have changed how schools get credit for serving vegetables and made it so that tomato paste on pizza wouldn\u2019t have automatically counted as a vegetable serving.\n\n\u201cWhile it is unfortunate that some in Congress chose to bow to special interests, U.S.D.A. remains committed to practical, science-based standards for school meals that improve the health of our children,\u201d the department said in the statement at the time.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Pizza is the second-highest source of calories for children after desserts.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Pizza is the second-highest source of calories for children after desserts.", "title": "Why Doctors May Start Talking More To Their Patients About Pizza", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2015/01/19/3612983/why-pediatricians-want-to-talk-to-kids-about-eating-pizza/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/shutterstock_50552851.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Pizza is the second-highest source of calories for children after desserts.", "creator": "@re_ari", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/shutterstock_50552851-320x213.jpg", "title": "Why Doctors May Start Talking More To Their Patients About Pizza", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/shutterstock_50552851.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/shutterstock_50552851.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-19T14:34:20+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd89b4\"", "article_summary": "Health Why Doctors May Start Talking More To Their Patients About Pizza CREDIT: ShutterstockAn analysis published on Monday by the journal Pediatrics found that on days when kids eat pizza they tend to take in more calories, fat and sodium.\nIt also found that on any given day, about 20 percent of kids eat pizza.\nOn these days, pizza composes 22 percent of children\u2019s calories and 26 percent of teens\u2019 calories.\nAccording to the study\u2019s authors, pizza is the second-highest source of calories for children after desserts such as cakes and cookies.\nThese additional calorie intakes are in-line with what happens when kids eat fast food."}
