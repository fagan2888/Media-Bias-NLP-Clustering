There are well-known platforms including Spotify and Beats, and just last week Amazon launched its own streaming service for Amazon Prime users. Now Google, which owns YouTube, is launching a service.\n\nUnfortunately, its plan hurts a large group of independent artists. Artists represented by XL Recordings and Domino Records will reportedly be affected.\n\n\u201cWhile we wish that we had 100% success rate, we understand that is not likely an achievable goal and therefore it is our responsibility to our users and the industry to launch the enhanced music experience,\u201d Kyncl told the Financial Times. According to Kyncl, around 90 percent of record labels have signed on.\n\nThe Guardian spoke to the head of trade organization Worldwide Independent Network (WIN), who says this is just not so. \u201cThey have suffered a simple but catastrophic error of judgement in misreading the market,\u201d WIN chief executive Alison Wenhan told the Guardian.\n\nThe licensing agency, Merlin, who represents independent labels, estimates that independent record labels represent 32.6 percent of the market\u2019s streaming and sales.\n\nWIN told the Guardian that YouTube has signed lucrative deals with major record labels, but presented lesser terms for independent labels. The Financial Times is also reporting that a label boss fears that improvements to YouTube\u2019s free service will be so compelling, folks won\u2019t pay for subscriptions.", "article_metadata": {"description": "YouTube, which is owned by Google, will begin blocking videos \"in a matter of days,\" reports the Financial Times", "title": "YouTube will block indie labels that don\u2019t sign onto its new streaming service", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "YouTube, which is owned by Google, will begin blocking videos \"in a matter of days,\" reports the Financial Times", "title": "YouTube will block indie labels that don\u2019t sign onto its new streaming service", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/17/youtube_will_block_indie_labels_who_dont_sign_onto_its_new_streaming_service/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2010/06/viacoms_youtube_loss_a_victory_for_online_speech_collaboration.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "YouTube, which is owned by Google, will begin blocking videos \"in a matter of days,\" reports the Financial Times", "title": "YouTube will block indie labels that don\u2019t sign onto its new streaming service", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2010/06/viacoms_youtube_loss_a_victory_for_online_speech_collaboration.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sarah Gray", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Google, independent artists, Music, Silicon Valley, streaming music, tech, YouTube", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd236\"", "article_summary": "The licensing agency, Merlin, who represents independent labels, estimates that independent record labels represent 32.6 percent of the market\u2019s streaming and sales.\nWIN told the Guardian that YouTube has signed lucrative deals with major record labels, but presented lesser terms for independent labels.\nThe Financial Times is also reporting that a label boss fears that improvements to YouTube\u2019s free service will be so compelling, folks won\u2019t pay for subscriptions.\nAccording to Kyncl, around 90 percent of record labels have signed on.\nThe music streaming field is getting crowded."}
