Starting today, you can order one on your smartphone.\n\nUber, the app that lets you hail a ride in a stranger\u2019s car, is now delivering flu shots to people in 35 cities across the United States, including San Francisco, Boston and New York. And you don\u2019t have to take a ride anywhere or stop by a pharmacy to get inoculated.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019ll cost you $10 for a wellness pack, but the nurse who arrives in an Uber car at your home or office can give flu shots to up to ten people at no additional cost. The wellness pack includes hand sanitizer, tissues, a tote bag, and even a lollipop.\n\nUber says it is not footing the bill for the nurses\u2019 time or the flu shots. Instead, the company is partnering with Passport Health, a provider of travel medicines, and Epidemico, a Boston-based analytics startup. Uber is paying for the delivery only.\n\nUber\u2019s Meghan Verena said the company has 10,000 flu shots to dole out this year. To request a nurse and get inoculated, tap an option on the company\u2019s app labeled \u201cUberHEALTH.\u201d\n\n\u2018I Don\u2019t Really Get It, But I\u2019m Old\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s not clear why Uber is branching into vaccinations. It\u2019s possible this program will help Uber expand its user base. The company may also be looking to improve its reputation after a slew of negative press on topics ranging from drivers\u2019 criminal records to health care and pay.\n\nUber\u2019s Verena hopes UberHEALTH will be a hit with small businesses and startups, which don\u2019t usually pay to bring in a nurse to vaccinate all of their employees at once. And Uber has not ruled out offering other types of vaccinations in the future.\n\n\u201cThe effort it would take to find out if I\u2019m covered for a flu shot, and where I can get it that\u2019s closest to me, it\u2019s sort of a hassle.\u201d\n\nNikhil Krishan, 23-year-old startup worker\n\nRegardless of Uber\u2019s intentions, epidemiologists we contacted say they support any new program that improves the rate of flu vaccinations. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that just over 30 percent of people ages 18 to 49 get inoculated.\n\n\u201cThe more options we give people, and the easier we make it to get vaccinated, that\u2019s a good thing,\u201d says Art Reingold, Professor and head of epidemiology at UC Berkeley\u2019s School of Public Health. \u201cI don\u2019t really get it myself. But I\u2019m old and not really part of the Uber generation.\u201d\n\nFor Reingold, it\u2019s not clear why people aren\u2019t heading over to their local Walgreens or CVS to avoid paying $10. Under the Affordable Care Act, flu shots are considered preventative and are covered at no additional charge to the patient.\n\nConvenience is King\n\n\u201cThe effort it would take to find out if I\u2019m covered for a flu shot, and where I can get it that\u2019s closest to me, it\u2019s sort of a hassle,\u201d said Nikhil Krishnan, 23, a New York-based research analyst at a startup called CBInsights.\n\nJohn Brownstein, an epidemiologist at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital and Harvard Medical School, has been working with Uber on the vaccination program for more than a year. Brownstein\u2019s research has found the \u2018on demand\u2019 component is actually very important to young people like Krishnan. Apps like Pager and Heal, which bring doctors and nurses to your doorstep, are growing in popularity.\n\nWhen Uber launched a pilot of UberHEALTH in four cities last year, Brownstein saw an important research opportunity. He sent survey questions to the 2,000 people who signed up to Uber\u2019s service, and got about 500 responses.\n\nAbout twenty percent of those who responded said they wouldn\u2019t have opted to get a flu shot from traditional providers. Almost 80 percent said the delivery of the vaccine, via Uber, was \u201cvery important\u201d to their decision to get vaccinated.\n\nBrownstein emphasizes that UberHEALTH is just one approach to improving vaccination rates. Another is to educate people who insist you can get the flu from a flu shot (you can\u2019t), and to make vaccinations more accessible to people in rural areas.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Uber is now delivering flu packs to people in 35 cities across the United States, including San Francisco.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Uber Offers $10 Flu Shots on Demand\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/futureofyou\\/2015\\/11\\/19\\/uber-offers-10-flu-shots-on-demand\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-11-19 09:00:18\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-11-19 13:53:59\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":69045,\"author_id\":\"3252\",\"author_name\":\"Christina Farr\",\"author_display_name\":\"Christina Farr\",\"tags\":[\"flu shot\",\"kqedscience\",\"uber\"],\"categories\":[\"Health Data\",\"Health Policy\",\"KQED News\",\"Mobile Health &amp; Wearables\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/futureofyou\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/13\\/2015\\/11\\/Uber.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "KQED Future of You", "description": "Uber is now delivering flu packs to people in 35 cities across the United States, including San Francisco.", "title": "Uber Offers $10 Flu Shots on Demand", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/futureofyou/2015/11/19/uber-offers-10-flu-shots-on-demand/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/futureofyou/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2015/11/UberHEALTH-Screenshot-677x600.png", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Uber is now delivering flu packs to people in 35 cities across the United States, including San Francisco.", "title": "Uber Offers $10 Flu Shots on Demand", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://ww2.kqed.org/futureofyou/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2015/11/Uber.jpg", "height": 1335}, "site": "@KQED", "widgets": {"link-color": "#000000", "border-color": "#000000"}, "partner": "tfwp", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Under the Affordable Care Act, flu shots are considered preventative and are covered at no additional charge to the patient.\nUber says it is not footing the bill for the nurses\u2019 time or the flu shots.\nUber\u2019s Meghan Verena said the company has 10,000 flu shots to dole out this year.\nAbout twenty percent of those who responded said they wouldn\u2019t have opted to get a flu shot from traditional providers.\nAnother is to educate people who insist you can get the flu from a flu shot (you can\u2019t), and to make vaccinations more accessible to people in rural areas."}
