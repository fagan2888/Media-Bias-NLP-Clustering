Mitch McConnell (R-KY) is out with a new campaign ad touting his success in securing free preventive health care services for Kentuckians. The spot, titled \u201cCares,\u201d tries to paint the Senate Minority Leader as a compassionate Republican who carries a moral obligation to provide sick people with access to government-sponsored health care.\n\nIt\u2019s a message you wouldn\u2019t expect from a Republican senate leader who has voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act and continues to oppose its implementation in Kentucky. But the minute-long ad, featuring Robert Pierce, an energy worker and throat cancer survivor, highlights the Republican Senate leader\u2019s effort to secure \u201ccancer screening programs\u201d for Kentuckians and provide them with government compensation. Watch the spot:\n\nThe assistance is the result of an entitlement McConnell secured for former employees of a plant in Paducah, Kentucky who were exposed to high levels of uranium throughout the 1950s and 1960s, and who now suffer from cancer or other ailments. As the Huffington Post\u2019s Zach Carter and Jason Cherkis catalogue in their exhaustive report on the crisis, McConnell had initially \u201ckept the plant\u2019s doors open\u201d to guarantee jobs for his constitutes, even as \u201cthe plant\u2019s toxins had spread through the air and into the ground, slowly killing its own workers and tainting the surrounding area.\u201d Though McConnell had toured the facility, \u201cknew about the contaminated water supply and the mountain of leaking storage containers,\u201d and had been in regular consultation with the Department of Energy about the crisis, he ultimately voted against an amendment that would have held nuclear subcontractors liable for negligence or misconduct at nuclear plants \u2014 and didn\u2019t take legislative action to help the plant\u2019s sick workers until 1999.\n\nAlmost two decades after employees began dying from cancer, and five years after the Paducah plant was declared a Superfund site by the Environmental Protection Agency, McConnell pushed through a new entitlement \u201cthat allowed plant workers over age 50 access to free body scans and free health care.\u201d The program also \u201cprovided $150,000 lump sum payments to workers who developed cancers or other illnesses from radiation exposures, and up to $250,000 in compensation for medical problems caused by other toxins.\u201d Once the benefit started flowing in 2001, McConnell and his wife, then-energy secretary Elaine Chao, even \u201cflew to Paducah and awarded the first $150,000 check.\u201d\n\nMcConnell has long used his influence to direct federal funds to other health care programs that closely resemble the preventive goals outlined in the Affordable Care Act. The Kentucky senator secured an earmark that ultimately provided pregnant women with sonograms and routine care. He also \u201cdirected money to everything from mobile health screenings to lab upgrades for stem cell research into heart failure\u201d and \u201cearmarked close to $3 million to fund heart health classes that would educate residents in the state\u2019s rural areas about how to eat better and exercise.\u201d\n\nYet ultimately, McConnell\u2019s piecemeal approaches to Kentucky\u2019s health care problems \u2014 it\u2019s a state where 17 percent of residents are uninsured, 69.1 percent of adults are overweight or obese, and 30 percent have high blood pressure \u2014 won\u2019t solve the state\u2019s public health care crisis. Obamacare, which has provided more than 116,000 Kentuckians with health care coverage, could. But McConnell still opposes the law. Responding to the state\u2019s success in implementing the measure, McConnell said he doesn\u2019t believe in \u201cfree\u201d benefits, telling reporters, \u201cThat\u2019s free health care. If you want to give out free health care you\u2019re going to have a lot of interest. Just like free anything else.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "The spot, titled \"Cares,\" tries to paint the Senate minority leader as a compassionate Republican who carries a moral obligation to provide sick people with access to health care.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "The spot, titled \"Cares,\" tries to paint the Senate minority leader as a compassionate Republican who carries a moral obligation to provide sick people with access to health care.", "title": "Mitch McConnell Boasts About Supporting Government Sponsored Health Care In New Campaign Ad", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/01/22/3190671/mitch-mcconnell-health-care/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Mcconnell.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The spot, titled \"Cares,\" tries to paint the Senate minority leader as a compassionate Republican who carries a moral obligation to provide sick people with access to health care.", "creator": "@@igorvolsky", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Mcconnell-321x214.jpg", "title": "Mitch McConnell Boasts About Supporting Government Sponsored Health Care In New Campaign Ad", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Mcconnell.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Mcconnell.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-22T13:00:09+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/ivolsky"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Health Mitch McConnell Boasts About Supporting Government Sponsored Health Care In New Campaign Ad CREDIT:Sen.
