Mark Udall. (Photo: Screenshot) The U.S. Senate race. The 6th Congressional District. Obamacare. Birth control. Immigration. The topics seem never ending -- and it will only get worse as the Nov. 4 general election nears.\n\nMore than $43 million in political ads \u2013 almost 18 days worth of time \u2013 have aired or will air through Election Day. That\u2019s according to contracts filed by Colorado television stations with the Federal Communications Commission through Aug. 15.\n\nThe tally doesn\u2019t include cable or satellite ad buys. Stations in Colorado Springs, Grand Junction and Durango weren\u2019t required to begin filing the ad contract information until July 1.\n\nEach week beginning Monday, Colorado Public Radio News will share updated information on political advertising, highlighting different aspects of the political ad invasion leading up to the Nov. 4 general election. of the political ads.\n\nBut today, some highlights so far:\n\nDemocratic candidates and groups are outspending Republicans so far about $24 million to $15 million.\n\nThe big-ticket race is the U.S. Senate contest between incumbent Democratic Sen. Mark Udall and his GOP challenger U.S. Rep. Cory Gardner. Udall has purchased $3.7 million and Gardner almost $3.2 million to promote their candidacies \u2013 and often to criticize the other candidate.\n\nUdall and Gardner aren\u2019t the biggest spenders in the Senate race. The Senate Majority PAC is spending almost $5.7 million while the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee is in for $4.3 million in ads. The National Republican Senatorial Committee has $1.8 million in ad contracts.\n\nIn the 6th Congressional District (CD6), Democratic challenger Andrew Romanoff has scheduled almost $1.2 million worth of ads; Coffman has yet to make a buy.\n\nBut the National Republican Congressional Committee has booked almost $2.8 million in ads to support Coffman. And the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has booked $1.2 million, with the House Majority PAC spending $967,000.\n\nIndependent outside groups also are spending heavily on the Senate race and, to a lesser extent, the CD6 matchup between GOP incumbent Rep. Mike Coffman and Democratic challenger Andrew Romanoff. Crossroads GPS, a \u201csocial welfare\u201d nonprofit that doesn\u2019t have to report its donations to the Federal Elections Commission, is spending $1.7 million. The ads don\u2019t suggest voting for or against a candidate but do criticize Udall.\n\nSeveral groups linked to the billionaire industrialist Koch Brothers are running ads. Freedom Partners has almost $1.2 million in ads, Generation Opportunity has $648,000, Americans for Prosperity has $382,000 and American Energy Alliance has almost $160,000. Like Crossroads, these ads criticize Udall, Romanoff and other Democrats on various issues.\n\nThe League of Conservation Voters has spent $818,000 on ads commending Udall, while the public employees union AFSCME has spent almost $711,000 on ads criticizing Republicans.\n\nAt the state level, Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper has $1.5 million in ads scheduled, while Bob Beauprez, his Republican opponent, has yet to make an ad buy.\n\nOutside groups are also spending on state level races. A new Democratic group Making Colorado Great has $1.6 million in ads that apparently will focus on the governor\u2019s race. And the Republican Attorneys General Association has scheduled more than $2 million in ads, apparently to support GOP Attorney General candidate Cynthia Coffman in her race against Democrat Don Quick for the open seat.\n\nYou can get a better sense of how the political ad wars are shaping up by exploring the graphic below:\n\nEditor's Correction: We originally reported that like Crossroads these ads criticize Udall, Coffman and other Democrats on various issues. Coffman is a Republican not a Democrat and we have corrected the story to reflect this.", "article_metadata": {"MobileOptimized": "width", "description": "Democratic candidates and groups are outspending Republicans so far.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"phone_number": "303-871-9191", "site_name": "Colorado Public Radio", "description": "Democratic candidates and groups are outspending Republicans so far.", "title": "$43 million, at least, in political ads to air in Colorado", "url": "http://www.cpr.org/news/story/43-million-least-political-ads-air-colorado", "region": "Colorado", "locality": "Centennial", "fax_number": "303-733-3319", "email": "info@cpr.org", "street-address": "7409 S Alton Ct", "postal-code": 80112, "type": "article", "image": "http://www.cpr.org/sites/default/files/images/08182014.political-ad_0.jpg", "country-name": "United States"}, "fb": {"app_id": 851183531577419}, "HandheldFriendly": "true", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9939\"", "article_summary": "More than $43 million in political ads \u2013 almost 18 days worth of time \u2013 have aired or will air through Election Day.\nThe Senate Majority PAC is spending almost $5.7 million while the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee is in for $4.3 million in ads.\nA new Democratic group Making Colorado Great has $1.6 million in ads that apparently will focus on the governor\u2019s race.\nBut today, some highlights so far:Democratic candidates and groups are outspending Republicans so far about $24 million to $15 million.\nIn the 6th Congressional District (CD6), Democratic challenger Andrew Romanoff has scheduled almost $1.2 million worth of ads; Coffman has yet to make a buy."}
