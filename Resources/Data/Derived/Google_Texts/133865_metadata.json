ISIS also threatened the execution of British hostage David Cawthorne Haines, sending a tweet today that read:\n\n#IS Beheads Steven Joel #Sotloff, Threatens to Execute Briton David Cawthorne Haines \u2014 SITE Intel Group (@siteintelgroup) September 2, 2014\n\nJames Carafano, vice president of foreign and defense policy studies at The Heritage Foundation, called the Sotloff beheading \u201cdespicable and beyond the pale.\u201d\n\nHe told The Daily Signal:\n\nISIS has committed countless atrocities since the invasion of Iraq began. Every one of them, including this act, is despicable and beyond the pale.\n\nCarafano added, \u201cThe president was wrong to characterize this as a humanitarian mission \u2014 this is a war against a regime every bit as brutal as any that has ever appeared on the face of the earth.\u201d\n\n>>>Q&A: Should the U.S. Bomb ISIS Targets in Syria?\n\nSotloff, a freelance journalist who worked for Time magazine and other publications and also spoke fluent Arabic, was abducted a year ago in Syria. Last week, his mother sent a message to the leader of the Islamic State, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, asking him to \u201cplease release my child.\u201d\n\nThe video released by the Islamic State, titled \u201cA Second Message to America,\u201d closely resembles the footage of American photojournalist James Foley\u2019s beheading last month.\n\nSotloff is seen in an orange jumpsuit while his executioner threatens President Obama with future attacks: \u201c\u2026just as your missiles continue to strike our people, our knife will continue to strike the necks of your people.\u201d\n\nThe executioner adds:\n\nWe take this opportunity to warn those governments that enter this evil alliance of America against the Islamic State to back off and leave our people alone.\n\nCarafano said this will not be the last atrocity committed by ISIS against America and its allies. He told The Daily Signal:\n\nIn this part of the world honor is power, and ISIS will do everything possible to show it can strike back even as it loses ground. There already has been an uptick of terrorist attacks in Baghdad and other key cities.\n\nCarafano warned that \u201ctime is not on our side\u201d in the war against the Islamic State and said the best way to bring justice, peace and security to the region is to help the Iraqi people take back their country as quickly as possible.\n\n\u201cThat has to be job No. 1,\u201d he said.\n\nU.S officials have not yet confirmed the authenticity of the video. Sotloff\u2019s family has been made aware of the situation and is requesting time to grieve.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, reportedly claims to have beheaded a second American journalist, Steven Joel Sotloff.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, reportedly claims to have beheaded a second American journalist, Steven Joel Sotloff.", "title": "Islamic State Beheads a Second American Journalist, Warns of More Executions", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/140902_Sotloff_Harkness.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-09-02T19:36:14+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/Z671TY"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, reportedly claims to have beheaded a second American journalist, Steven Joel Sotloff.", "title": "Islamic State Beheads a Second American Journalist, Warns of More Executions", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/140902_Sotloff_Harkness.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "International", "tag": "terrorism", "published_time": "2014-09-02T17:05:26+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-02T19:36:14+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "beheading, Sotloff beheading, Sotloff execution, steve Sotloff, ISIS, Islamic State, Islamic State beheading, Sotloff beheading video"}, "article_summary": "The Islamic State terrorist group, also known as ISIS or ISIL, claims to have beheaded a second American journalist, Steven Joel Sotloff.\nLast week, his mother sent a message to the leader of the Islamic State, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, asking him to \u201cplease release my child.\u201dThe video released by the Islamic State, titled \u201cA Second Message to America,\u201d closely resembles the footage of American photojournalist James Foley\u2019s beheading last month.\nCarafano said this will not be the last atrocity committed by ISIS against America and its allies.\nA video of the execution was made public by jihadist monitoring organization SITE Intel Group.\nSotloff, a freelance journalist who worked for Time magazine and other publications and also spoke fluent Arabic, was abducted a year ago in Syria."}
