More to the point, the elections have reduced it from one of the nation\u2019s most respected state tribunals into a disgraceful mess.\"\n\nThe author was former journalist Lincoln Caplan, who is a visiting lecturer at Yale Law School.\n\nOn Friday, on Wisconsin Public Television's \"Here and Now\" program, Chief Justice Pat Roggensack responded to the article by saying:\n\n\"I would tell you the person didn't spend any time investigating the Wisconsin Supreme Court. We are constantly cited by supreme courts of other states, by federal courts, for the reasoning and the thoroughness of our opinions.
