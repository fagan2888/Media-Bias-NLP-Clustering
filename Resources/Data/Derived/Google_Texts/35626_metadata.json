This doesn\u2019t mean the church doubts the couple is truly married, nor does it signify any disrespect toward Judaism with which -- yes -- Christianity has great affinity.\n\nThe Canon Law Society of America commentary on the 1983 law code notes there\u2019ve been \u201cextensive changes\u201d toward leniency in marriage rules since the Second Vatican Council, partly because such mixed marriages have become \u201cmore commonplace and socially acceptable.\u201d\n\nTechnically, marriage with a non-Christian involves \u201cthe impediment of disparity of cult.\u201d The local bishop must issue a \u201cdispensation\u201d for \u201cjust and reasonable cause\u201d to allow such a marriage in church. This occurs much more routinely than it used to. Thus Catholicism is much more open to intermarriage than much of Judaism (see below).\n\nTo have a church wedding, the Catholic party must vow to avoid dangers that might lead him or her to leave the Catholic faith and, canon law continues, \u201cmakes a sincere promise to do all in his or her power to have all the children baptized and brought up in the Catholic Church.\u201d The non-Christian party to marriage is informed of these commitments \u201cat an appropriate time.\u201d Before canon law reforms, the pledge about raising children was also required from the non-Christian party, and usually in writing.\n\nNote that those same requirements hold when a Catholic marries a baptized Christian from a different denomination where there\u2019s no \u201cimpediment.\u201d The impediment, however, applies with marriages to those who consider themselves Christians but are not baptized (e.g. Quakers, Salvation Army members) or whose churches practice baptism that Catholicism deems invalid on theological grounds (e.g. those Pentecostals who deny the Trinity or, as of 2001, Mormons).\n\nHelpful discussions of matters like this, written in a manner to aid understanding by ordinary church members, are available at http://canonlawmadeeasy.com. This site notes that \u201cwhile the church isn\u2019t particularly keen on Catholics marrying non-Christians, we can see that it often permits it.\u201d Further comment observes that if it\u2019s not clear the Catholic party will undertake the required promises the bishop will decline permission for a church wedding.\n\nTo continue reading, click here.", "article_metadata": {"description": "LISA ASKS:\r\n\r\nWhen a Catholic marries a Jew, does the Catholic Church recognize that \r\nmarriage as a sacrament, since Catholicism has roots in Judaism?\r\n\r\nTHE RELIGION GUY ANSWERS:\r\n\r\nNo. In the church\u2019s view a marriage between a Catholic and an adherent of \r\nJudaism (or any other non-Christian religion) is not a sacrament.
