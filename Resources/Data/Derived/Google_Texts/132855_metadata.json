McMahon, president of the right-leaning Empire Center for Public Policy, said at Wednesday\u2019s City & State minimum wage forum at New York Law School that the proposed wage hike could result in nonprofits losing workers to other sectors.\n\n\u201cNonprofits are freaking out about this,\u201d McMahon said. \u201cThe more compelling a case they make to the Legislature and governor for how this will disrupt their model, the more likely the governor and Legislature will say: Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll take care of you with a carve-out or a slowdown. That won\u2019t help much because if the rest of the labor market has got its pay rising, they\u2019re going to be threatened by the loss of some of their workers to the other businesses.\u201d\n\nMcMahon contended that the wage hike\u2019s adverse impact on nonprofits would largely be a function of organizations\u2019 reliance on government sources of funding.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be very, very disruptive, especially for the nonprofits, many of whom depend on federal aid streams, which have no cognizance of a $15 minimum wage,\u201d McMahon said. \u201cIs the state going to reimburse the hundreds of millions of dollars this is likely to cost them? I would say likely it is not.\u201d\n\nOther panelists agreed that the impact to the sector would be sizable, but suggested that solutions for the sector could be built in to the wage hike proposal.\n\nPaul Sonn, general counsel of the left-leaning National Employment Law Project, cited potential savings to the state budget as workers at human services agencies earn more and rely less on state-funded Medicaid as a possible solution. As wages increase, Sonn argued, workers would transition to health care exchanges established under the Affordable Care Act, which are overwhelmingly funded by the federal government. According to Sonn, this shift could represent \u201chundreds of millions of dollars\u201d in savings in the state budget, which could then be used to support nonprofits.\n\n\u201cNo doubt about it: there\u2019s going to be a big impact to nonprofits,\u201d Sonn said. \u201cThat\u2019s why the state Legislature as part of this should use the savings to the state budget to increase support for the nonprofits that have been underinvested in for years.\u201d\n\nSonn also suggested that the proposal has wide support within the human services nonprofit community, mentioning a coalition of organizations spearheaded by Jennifer Jones Austin, chief executive officer of the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies, and the Fiscal Policy Institute \u201cto advocate and push the Legislature to use the savings in the budget to provide needed and long overdue support.\u201d\n\nBut this approach was met with skepticism by some of the panel\u2019s more conservative members, including Republican state Sen. Jack Martins, who argued that nonprofits would be unable to absorb the cost of the proposed wage increase without unfair government intervention.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re suggesting that we should take money out of the state budget so that we \u2013 so that taxpayers \u2013 can subsidize increased wages for not-for-profits and keep them operating,\u201d Martins said. \u201cI don\u2019t know that that model works either, that taxpayers of the state should be asked to absorb the impact to our not-for-profit community from an increased wage.\u201d\n\nIn contrast, Hector Figueroa, president of 32BJ Service Employees International Union and a vocal advocate for the wage hike, stressed that state government must prioritize support for the nonprofit sector, as it has played an ever-expanding role in the lives of low-income New Yorkers.\n\n\u201cWe need to look at ways for entities like nonprofits that are feeling a vacuum as the government has not met its obligations, as the economy has become more unequal and people who are insecure \u2013 retirement income has disappeared and they need to rely on nonprofits and charities,\u201d Figueroa said. \u201cWe have to figure out with the nonprofits, with the charities, what other things can be done so that they can function, whether it is in the form of subsidies or whether it is in the form of providing space.\u201d\n\nUltimately, Figueroa argued, policymakers must confront this issue now in order to avoid larger stresses on both individual workers and the overall economy.\n\n\u201cWe have to be prepared to understand that if we don\u2019t address this question of the minimum wage now, we\u2019re going to be facing a much bigger problem in the near future,\" Figueroa said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "City&State, the only media company solely devoted to government and politics in New York, provides insightful coverage of the state's politics, policies and people.", "author": "Jeff Stein", "og": {"image": "http://cityandstateny.com/assets/image-cache/_img/cityandstate-og2.jpg", "title": "Nonprofit funding a sticking point in $15 minimum wage debate"}, "sailthru.date": "Dec 02, 2015", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIs the state going to reimburse the hundreds of millions of dollars this is likely to cost them?\n\u201cNo doubt about it: there\u2019s going to be a big impact to nonprofits,\u201d Sonn said.\n\u201cYou\u2019re suggesting that we should take money out of the state budget so that we \u2013 so that taxpayers \u2013 can subsidize increased wages for not-for-profits and keep them operating,\u201d Martins said.\nAccording to Sonn, this shift could represent \u201chundreds of millions of dollars\u201d in savings in the state budget, which could then be used to support nonprofits.\nMcMahon, president of the right-leaning Empire Center for Public Policy, said at Wednesday\u2019s City & State minimum wage forum at New York Law School that the proposed wage hike could result in nonprofits losing workers to other sectors."}
