And we may all be able to achieve it. fotologic, CC BY 2.0\n\nAfter a qualifying race leading up to the 1988 Monaco Grand Prix, the famed Formula One driver Ayrton Senna said he realized he was driving his car for much of the race \u201cby a kind of instinct.\u201d Similarly, LA Laker great Kobe Bryant has said that when he\u2019s playing his best, \u201cthings just happen.\u201d Time stands still. It\u2019s \u201ceffortless.\u201d\n\nThese sentiments paint the classic picture found in sports of being in \u201cthe zone.\u201d An ethereal, mystical intersection of extreme focus and motivation, \u201cthe zone\u201d is a mental state where surrounding noises simply fade away. The zone is a tunnel. It\u2019s unconscious. And it\u2019s where performance most easily emerges from excellence. It\u2019s also, as psychologists have been learning for decades, perhaps the purest form of internal reward a human being can find.\n\nThe Hungarian psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (pronounced Cheek-sent-muh-hy-ee) has been researching the concept of \u201cthe zone\u201d since the 1950s. He calls it \u201cflow.\u201d Through his research, he\u2019s found that flow isn\u2019t limited to the arena of sports. Authors, painters, sculptors, and surgeons are all capable of entering a state of flow. According to Csikszentmihalyi, these behaviors make for a sense of fulfillment that far exceeds any external reward, such as money or acclaim. It is the sensation of being enraptured, immersed, mesmerized, even, that produces such happiness.\n\n\u201cWe can be happy experiencing the passive pleasure of a rested body, warm sunshine, or the contentment of a serene relationship, but this kind of happiness is dependent on favorable external circumstances,\u201d he wrote in Psychology Today. \u201cThe happiness that follows flow is of our own making, and it leads to increasing complexity and growth in consciousness.\u201d\n\nAttaining Flow\n\nSlipping into a state of flow, where behaviors happen seemingly through no conscious action or intent, comes with several criteria. First, not everyone can necessarily achieve a state of flow at all times. In 1997, Csikszentmihalyi devised a way of thinking about a state of flow that put it at the nexus of high-skill and high-challenge. Other states, such as boredom (mid-skill, low-challenge) and worry (low-skill, mid-challenge) fall somewhere around flow, depending on their levels of challenge and skill. The activity must somehow find both of the two to achieve a state of flow.\n\nBut perhaps the two most important ingredients for flow are motivation and ability in the person. If you can\u2019t paint worth a lick, no amount of motivation will let you abandon conscious effort, because you just aren\u2019t good enough. Conversely, a world-class author won\u2019t produce anything of value if she has no desire to even sit at the computer, let alone write. The more you have of both, the easier reaching flow becomes. It also helps, Csikszentmihalyi points out, to have a personality well-suited for flow. Ideally you\u2019ll be curious, persistent, avoid self-centeredness, and enjoy intrinsic reward. Collectively, these traits are known as \u201cautotelic personality.\u201d\n\nBut for those who don\u2019t possess great creative skill or the desire to do things for their own sake (Hey, no one\u2019s saying a little something for the effort wouldn\u2019t be nice), the experience of flow may still be within reach. As Csikszentmihalyi writes, the mundane tasks we perform at work or in our everyday lives may hold potential for flow.\n\nRather than cut corners, he says, flow can be found in the sense of accomplishment. The inert act of painting a portrait, which contributes nothing externally, has a sense of accomplishment built in. The same may be possible for the average grocery store clerk, simply by asking several questions: Is this step necessary? Can it be done better, faster, more efficiently? What additional steps could make my contribution more valuable?\n\n\u201cWhen approached without too many cultural prejudices and with a determination to make it personally meaningful, even the most mundane job can produce flow,\u201d he argues.\n\nIncorporating Flow\n\nUnless you\u2019ve dedicated your life to the arts, you\u2019ll probably find yourself in the second camp Csikszentmihalyi describes: Flow isn\u2019t embedded in your life as much as you must incorporate it by choice. For this, there are a number of obstacles people naturally face. Csikszentmihalyi advocates mindfulness.\n\n\u201cEven the most routine tasks, like washing dishes, dressing, or mowing the lawn, become more rewarding if we approach them with the care it would take to make a work of art,\u201d he says. Think of these tasks, which we\u2019d normally write off as chores, as meaningful activities that actually deserve to be appreciated. Find the art in them. And as Csikszentmihalyi clarifies, it wouldn\u2019t hurt if these activities ultimately harnessed the power of flow for good.\n\n\u201cTeenagers arrested for vandalism or robbery often have no other motivation than the excitement they experience stealing a car or breaking into a house,\u201d he writes. \u201cThus, it is not enough to strive for enjoyable goals, but one must also choose goals that will reduce the sum total of entropy in the world.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "harnessing, sports, psychology, everyday, life, how, achieve, sense, flow, and, get, zone", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Call it being \"in the zone\" or \"in a state of flow,\" but the mindset is the same.
