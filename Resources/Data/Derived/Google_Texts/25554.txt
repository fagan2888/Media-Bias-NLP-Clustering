Mednax Builds Anesthesia Practice with Another Acquisition

The health care business bought another anesthesiology group in January

Mednax Inc. (NYSE: MD) has acquired Mosaic Anesthesia & Perioperative Services PC as the health care company builds its anesthesiology practice.

The target, based in New Bern, North Carolina, has 15 anesthesiologists that provide general, neurosurgery, cardiac, orthopedic, vascular, obstetric, gynecologic and ENT anesthesiology services in North Carolina.

Largely through acquisition, Mednax has grown its anesthesiology practice to more than 2,400 providers. In January, Mednax bought Memac Associates PC, an anesthesiology practice in Michigan, and before that, acquired MedData, a billing technology business, in August.
