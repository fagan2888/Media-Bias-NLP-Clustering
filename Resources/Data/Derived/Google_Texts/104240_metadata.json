The decision was noted in government records but the public didn\u2019t hear about it until March this year when a newspaper reported the change.\n\nConsumer Watchdog filed a Public Records Act request for the audit and other records associated with the revocation of Blue Shield\u2019s tax-exempt status.\n\nIn a letter to Franchise Tax Board directors last week, Consumer Watchdog wrote:\n\n\u201cOver the last seven weeks, Consumer Watchdog has been attempting to access public records related to the Franchise Tax Board\u2019s decision to repeal Blue Shield\u2019s tax-exempt status. To date, FTB staff have refused to respond to Consumer Watchdog\u2019s Public Records Act request and have failed to provide any legal support for withholding the documents. We call on you to direct the Franchise Tax Board staff to release these critical public records immediately.\n\n\u201cThese records are of utmost importance. Millions of Californians who purchased and renewed their health insurance with Blue Shield during the last Obamacare open enrollment period late last year believed Blue Shield was non-profit. The public has the right to know why the Franchise Tax Board revoked Blue Shield\u2019s tax-exempt status.\u201d\n\nState Officials Say Confidentiality Laws Prohibit Disclosure\n\nIn an email responding to questions from California Healthline, Franchise Tax Board officials said they \u201ccannot provide the requested information due to confidentiality laws.\u201d\n\nJerry Flanagan, lead staff attorney for Consumer Watchdog, believes state officials are misinterpreting state statutes regarding confidentiality. He said the information his organization is asking to see should be available to the public.\n\n\u201cWe hope they rethink their decision and decide to make the information public, but if they don\u2019t we\u2019re not going to just go away,\u201d Flanagan said. He said Consumer Watchdog\u2019s next step would be in court seeking a writ of mandate.\n\n\u201cI think this is a good example of a state agency that just doesn\u2019t have its head in the game,\u201d Flanagan said. \u201cThey should be thinking about consumers first, not keeping corporate secrets secret. Government agencies have to be thinking that their number one job is to serve the people of California. And in this situation, they\u2019re not doing that.\u201d\n\nBlue Shield Declines Comment\n\nBlue Shield officials, who are appealing the state\u2019s revocation of tax exemption, declined to comment about Consumer Watchdog\u2019s campaign for public disclosure. They have other things to contend with, including:\n\nState scrutiny of Blue Shield\u2019s proposed $1.25 billion acquisition of Care1st, a multistate Medicaid and Medicare insurer with more than 524,000 enrollees. At the request of four advocacy groups \u2014 the California Public Interest Research Group, Consumers Union, Health Access and the Western Center on Law & Poverty \u2014 the California Department of Managed Health Care scheduled a hearing next month to examine the proposed acquisition;\n\nA campaign by Blue Shield\u2019s former director of public policy, Michael Johnson, to get the company to go for-profit and repay Californians for years of tax exemptions. At his website makeitrightblueshield.org, visitors are greeted with \u201cBlue Shield of California owes the public billions of dollars. Tell them to give it back\u201d; and\n\nRepercussions of a scandal involving Blue Shield\u2019s firing of a top executive last month, claiming he spent the company\u2019s money extravagantly on trips with his girlfriend. Former chief technology officer Aaron Kaufman was in charge of Blue Shield\u2019s $25 million information technology budget and oversaw 30 employees.\n\nBlue Shield of California covers about 3.4 million people, making it the state\u2019s third-largest health insurer behind not-for-profit Kaiser Permanente and for-profit Anthem. Blue Shield, with about 5,000 employees, reported $13.6 billion in revenue last year.\n\nIf Blue Shield does not prevail in its appeal of the tax ruling, it will retain its not-for-profit business structure, Blue Shield officials said. There is \u201cno appetite\u201d at Blue Shield for following the example of its cousin Blue Cross of California (now part of Anthem) which two decades ago made the switch from not-for-profit to for-profit. State officials told Blue Cross in the mid-1990s the company must repay $3 billion to Californians for the years of tax exemptions. The money was used to create two foundations \u2014 The California Endowment and California HealthCare Foundation, which publishes California Healthline.\n\nScrutiny May Spread to Other Not-For-Profits\n\nFlanagan said one of the reasons Consumer Watchdog wants to know the details behind the state\u2019s decision to revoke tax exemption is to use the same yardstick to measure other not-for-profit health companies in the state.\n\n\u201cThere are many reasons we can point to but we\u2019re more interested in seeing which reasons the state took into account when it made this decision,\u201d Flanagan said.\n\n\u201cIf we can see the records and how they were interpreted we can look at some of the other huge tax-exempt corporations like Kaiser and Dignity and Sutter and see if they\u2019re measuring up.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "<p>Consumer advocates want to know how state officials came to the decision last year to revoke Blue Shield of California's status as a tax-exempt not-for-profit health care company.
