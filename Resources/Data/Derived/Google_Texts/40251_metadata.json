REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst (UNITED STATES - Tags: POLITICS BUSINESS EMPLOYMENT) - RTR3G353\n\n4129383\n\nThe state of Massachusetts \u2014 touted by President Obama as the model for national health-care reform \u2014 is firing the company that designed both its failed state Obamacare enrollment website and also the Obama administration\u2019s federal enrollment site.\n\nMassachusetts is firing Canadian company CGI, which holds a $69 million contract to run the state\u2019s Obamacare site. The state has already paid the company approximately $15.9 million. CGI was previously fired by the federal government in January.\n\n\u201cWe have made the decision that we are going to be parting ways with CGI,\u201d said Sarah Iselin, who serves as Governor Deval Patrick\u2019s special assistant on the state\u2019s Obamacare website fix, at a Monday board of directors meeting for the Massachusetts Obamacare exchange.\n\nCGI\u2019s incompetence is costing the state $10 million per month in unforeseen enrollment costs and preventing Massachusetts from having a fully working enrollment website until October 2014, according to an estimate.\n\nBut while CGI\u2019s relationship with the Bay State is over, the company is still on good terms with the federal government.\n\nThe Daily Caller reported that CGI received six additional contracts from the Obama administration\u2019s Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services after the disastrous launch of the federal government\u2019s Obamacare enrollment site. The six contracts were awarded between October 1 \u2014 when the over $600 million Obamacare website launched \u2014 through January 2014.\n\nCGI Federal is the U.S. arm of the Canadian company CGI Group, and was formed in 2009 to bring CGI into the federal contracting business. The company employs Michelle Obama\u2019s Princeton classmate, and 2010 White House Christmas guest, Toni Townes-Whitley as a top executive.\n\nCGI, which received the Obamacare website contract in Obama\u2019s first term, was fired from its role as prime contractor on the federal government website in January. But the company still holds numerous government contracts, including a $6 billion contract with the Department of Homeland Security awarded less than a month before the failed Obamacare site went live and a prime contract on the Army\u2019s much-maligned Human Terrain System, a failed program that sends academics into war zones to help soldiers understand local populations.\n\nMassachusetts\u2019 capital city of Boston now has the longest wait times to see a doctor of any of the 15 major U.S. cities. Bostonians wait an average of 45.5 days for an appointment with a family physician, dermatologist, orthopedic surgeon, or cardiologist.\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s because you guys had a proven model that we built the Affordable Care Act on\u2026 Your law was the model for the nation\u2019s law,\u201d Obama said in an October 30 speech at Boston\u2019s Fanueil Hall.\n\nFollow Patrick on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Patrick Howley", "description": "Massachusetts shows CGI the door", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "The state of Massachusetts -- touted by President Obama as the model for national health-care reform -- is firing the company that designed both its failed state Obamacare enrollment website and also", "title": "State touted as Obama\u2019s health-care reform model fires its Obamacare website contractor", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/03/18/state-touted-as-obamas-health-care-reform-model-fires-its-obamacare-website-contractor/", "image": {"width": 630, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/deval.jpg", "height": 270}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Massachusetts shows CGI the door", "title": "State touted as Obama\u2019s health-care reform model fires its Obamacare website contractor Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/03/18/state-touted-as-obamas-health-care-reform-model-fires-its-obamacare-website-contractor/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/deval.jpg"}, "creator": "@patrickhowleydc", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-03-18 09:18:38", "sailthru.title": "State touted as Obama's health-care reform model fires its Obamacare website contractor", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "massachusetts,obamacare,patrick-howley", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "massachusetts,obamacare", "sailthru.description": "The state of Massachusetts -- touted by President Obama as the model for national health-care reform -- is firing the company that designed both its failed state Obamacare enrollment website and also", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/deval.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "The six contracts were awarded between October 1 \u2014 when the over $600 million Obamacare website launched \u2014 through January 2014.\nCGI, which received the Obamacare website contract in Obama\u2019s first term, was fired from its role as prime contractor on the federal government website in January.\nMassachusetts is firing Canadian company CGI, which holds a $69 million contract to run the state\u2019s Obamacare site.\nCGI Federal is the U.S. arm of the Canadian company CGI Group, and was formed in 2009 to bring CGI into the federal contracting business.\n\u201cWe have made the decision that we are going to be parting ways with CGI,\u201d said Sarah Iselin, who serves as Governor Deval Patrick\u2019s special assistant on the state\u2019s Obamacare website fix, at a Monday board of directors meeting for the Massachusetts Obamacare exchange."}
