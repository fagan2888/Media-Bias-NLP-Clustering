Ted Cruz (R-Texas) is pushing for Attorney General Eric Holder to face impeachment, MSNBC host Melissa Harris-Perry has nothing but praise for the Justice Department head and is wondering if Holder is \u201cthe Obama we had been hoping for?\u201d\n\nDuring her show Saturday, Harris-Perry and her Nerdland panelists praised the attorney general for the various civil rights causes he has championed, including pushing back against voter ID laws. While the MSNBC host commended President Obama for nominating Holder to his esteemed position, Harris-Perry pondered if the attorney general accomplished much of what Obama supporters hoped the president himself would do.\n\n\u201cWhile we may not be able to fully appreciate the accomplishments of this administration until, say, a decade hence, that\u2019s in part because so much of the civil rights is actually happening in the Department of Justice,\u201d Harris-Perry said during her show. \u201cSo I kept asking myself, is Eric Holder the Obama that we had been hoping for?\u201d\n\nWhile the panel agreed that it wasn\u2019t entirely fair to \u201cseparate\u201d Holder from the president, Fordham University\u2019s Christina Greer touted the attorney general as \u201cthe greatest addition to the entire Obama administration.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the long term, the foundational work that he\u2019s doing will actually pay off in dividends and will actually help Obama\u2019s legacy,\u201d she said.\n\nGreer noted that many have been \u201cdisappointed\u201d with President Obama, especially for the record number of deportations under his administration, but said Holder has started fights she believes will pay off in the future.\n\nThe panel made sure to discuss comments Holder made during a speech at the Rev. Al Sharpton\u2019s National Action Network\u2019s conference this week, where he said that no other attorney general has been treated by Congress as he has.\n\n\u201cThat was kind of a lovely moment,\u201d Harris-Perry said of an exchange between Holder and Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Texas), where the Republican congressman brought up the attorney general\u2019s contempt charges. \u201cIt could be about him being African-American, I think there\u2019s a hypothetical that\u2019s at the table. I think the another possibility is that it could be about how aggressively and effectively he is at the core of implementing that.\u201d\n\nWhile at the helm of the Justice Department, Holder has sued Texas and North Carolina for voter ID laws, endorsed a proposal to lessen prison sentences for nonviolent drug offenders and expanded the federal government\u2019s recognition of same-sex marriage.\n\nDespite the praise Harris-Perry and her panel had for Holder, though, the House of Representatives also voted to hold the attorney general in contempt for failing to turn over documents relating to the botched gun-running scandal, Fast and Furious.\n\nWatch Harris-Perry and her panel discuss Holder\u2019s accomplishments below.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "While Sen.
