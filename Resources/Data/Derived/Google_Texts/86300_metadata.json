Should I be happy that someone is at least talking about the 566 tribes? We are a mere 1.6 % of the voting population. Of course, we know that only a third of all Indians live on reservations. We are many urban Indians. And we vote.\n\n\n\nI am no stranger to what Bernie Sanders stands for. I\u2019m one of those committed political animals that tunes in to C-SPAN and watches politics live. Bernie is a powerhouse in Congress. He has been for years. He was on the short side of the vote but many would say on the right side of history on issues including the Vietnam War, the Patriot Act and the Wall Street bailout--often one of only a handful of dissenting votes, taking courageous stands.\n\n\u201cWhen I am President I will begin a new relationship with the Nations as one sovereign to another sovereign nation. We will honor our treaties and agreement,\u201d he has pledged now, during his presidential candidacy.\n\nI looked it up and for 35 years he has voted to uphold sovereignty for the Nations--in spite of the fact that he is from Vermont a State that has not one Reservation or casino. Is he pandering to Indians or does he really care?\n\n\u201cWe will develop if I am elected President a new relationship with the Native American people. We will honor our treaties and agreements,\u201d Senator Sanders said at a community meeting in Pine Ridge, South Dakota on Thursday in the very heart of Indian Country. \"We owe a debt of gratitude to the Native Americans that can never be repaid.\u201d\n\nHe spoke of changing the \u201cfundamental relationship\u201d between the U.S. government and the Native American community. He spoke of high poverty, unemployment, and substance abuse in Native American conditions. Sanders decried the wealth inequality in the U.S. , then called for creating jobs, investing in building affordable housing and infrastructure, making healthcare a right and college education free, protecting nature, clean air and water. \u201cOne of the most important lessons that Native Americans have taught our nation is the importance of living with nature,\u201d he said adding that failing to live with nature can \u201cdestroy our planet.\u201d He also pledged to address climate change through a transition away from fossil fuels and to sustainable energy.\n\n\u201cTogether, we are going to create the jobs, and the healthcare and the educational opportunities that people here at Pine Ridge and across Indian Country are entitled to,\u201d the Vermont Senator concluded.\n\nWatch the Youtube video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9joMslOVKQ", "article_metadata": {"description": "By Leon Thompson, Tribal Beat May 15, 2016 (Pine Ridge, Sd.) \u2013 When Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders spoke in San Diego, he said, among other others, \u201cThis campaign is about the Native Americans.\u201c\u00a0 I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever heard a politician even talk about Indians let alone include them in his race for President.\u00a0 Should I be happy that someone is at least talking about the 566 tribes?\u00a0 \u00a0We are a mere 1.6 % of the voting population.\u00a0 Of course, we know that only a third of all Indians live on reservations.\u00a0 We are many urban Indians.\u00a0 And we vote.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "East County Magazine", "description": "By Leon Thompson, Tribal Beat May 15, 2016 (Pine Ridge, Sd.) \u2013 When Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders spoke in San Diego, he said, among other others, \u201cThis campaign is about the Native Americans.\u201c\u00a0 I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever heard a politician even talk about Indians let alone include them in his race for President.\u00a0 Should I be happy that someone is at least talking about the 566 tribes?\u00a0 \u00a0We are a mere 1.6 % of the voting population.\u00a0 Of course, we know that only a third of all Indians live on reservations.\u00a0 We are many urban Indians.\u00a0 And we vote.", "title": "BERNIE SANDERS STANDS UP FOR NATIVE AMERICAN RIGHTS AT THE PINE RIDGE RESERVATION COMMUNITY MEETING", "url": "http://www.eastcountymagazine.org/bernie-sanders-stands-native-american-rights-pine-ridge-reservation-community-meeting", "image": "http://www.eastcountymagazine.org/sites/eastcountymagazine.org/files/2016/May/bernie.jpg%3F308", "updated_time": "2016-05-15T11:49:13-07:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "MobileOptimized": "width", "article": {"published_time": "2016-05-15T11:38:44-07:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-15T11:49:13-07:00"}, "HandheldFriendly": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "By Leon Thompson, Tribal BeatMay 15, 2016 (Pine Ridge, Sd.)\nWe will honor our treaties and agreements,\u201d Senator Sanders said at a community meeting in Pine Ridge, South Dakota on Thursday in the very heart of Indian Country.\nOf course, we know that only a third of all Indians live on reservations.\n\u201cTogether, we are going to create the jobs, and the healthcare and the educational opportunities that people here at Pine Ridge and across Indian Country are entitled to,\u201d the Vermont Senator concluded.\n\u201cWe will develop if I am elected President a new relationship with the Native American people."}
