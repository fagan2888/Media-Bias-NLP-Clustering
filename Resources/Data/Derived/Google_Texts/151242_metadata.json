Because of his extensive knowledge of medicine, Spaulding was known in the newsroom as \"Doc.\"\n\n\"Doctors read it very carefully,\" the newspaper's former features writer Mike Drew said. \"Patients did too.\"\n\nHe added that Spaulding was a talented tennis and squash player.\n\n\"He would beat me right handed, and then he would beat me left handed,\" Drew said.\n\nRuth Zubrensky, a longtime family friend, said Spaulding was \"very intense\" about things he cared about, including journalism, tennis and wine. She added that he and her husband, Leonard, were both \"health fanatics\" and active, fit men, who loved tennis as well as wine.\n\n\"He was very focused on everything he did,\" she said.\n\nIn 1971, Spaulding was invited to California to become a senior lecturer by Edwin Bayley, the founding dean of the Graduate School of Journalism at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nSpaulding and his late wife, Barbara, bought 40 acres of land in California, which they developed into Spaulding Vineyard. They then converted it into Stonegate Winery, and came to be known as pioneers in the creation of the Napa Valley as a source of world-class wines.\n\nHe was a self-made man, said his daughter Ann.\n\n\"My dad was smart, witty, and he was a man of integrity,\" she said. \"From a child's standpoint, he always said, 'You won't get punished if you tell the truth.'\"\n\nShe added that he always told his children, \"Whatever you do, do the best you can.\"\n\nSpaulding is survived by his wife, Martha Casselman, three children, David, Susan, and Ann Spaulding, two grandsons, and two great-grandchildren. He is also survived by his sister Jane Nordberg of Northbrook, Ill.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Spaulding, a longtime Journal medical writer, did his best in everything", "og": {"url": "http://www.jsonline.com/news/obituaries/spaulding-a-longtime-journal-medical-writer-did-his-best-in-everything-b99580102z1-328379261.html", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/b99580102z.1_20150919191232_000_g76cl0fc.1-0.jpg", "height": 805}, "type": "article", "description": "James \u201cJim\u201d Spaulding stood out as a medical writer, a winemaker, and an athlete.
