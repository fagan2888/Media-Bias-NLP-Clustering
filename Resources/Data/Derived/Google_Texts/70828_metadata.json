(The Washington Post)\n\nHere are the key moments from the last day before the financial default deadline, when the Senate and House came together to pass a deal to reopen the government. (The Washington Post)\n\nFederal agencies, parks, museums and monuments began to reopen Thursday morning, after a chastened Congress ended a bitter funding standoff that triggered a 16-day government closure and drove the nation toward the brink of default.\n\nThe agreement struck by Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) funds agencies through mid-January, calls hundreds of thousands of civil servants back to work and raises the $16.7 trillion debt limit.\n\n\u201cThere are no winners here,\u201d President Obama said at the White House late Thursday morning. \u201cThese last few weeks have inflicted completely unnecessary damage on our economy.\u201d\n\n[Read the latest updates.]\n\nObama called on Congress to resist \u201cpressure from the extremes\u201d and \u201cunderstand that how business is done in this town has to change.\u201d He urged lawmakers to pursue a \u201cbalanced approach to a responsible budget\u201d and to pass comprehensive immigration reform and a new farm bill.\n\n1 of 74 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Scenes from the shutdown, debt talks View Photos The federal government shutdown entered a third week before a deal was reached Wednesday to reopen the government and raise the debt limit.

The cub, now nearly two months old, gained two pounds during the shutdown, the zoo announced Thursday.\n\nThe Department of Veteran Affairs said it would issue benefit payments to about 5 million veterans, survivors and their families on Nov. 1 as scheduled now that funding has been restored. The VA had warned that if the shutdown continued to the end of the month, it would run out of funds and be unable to issue checks, a disclosure that caused major consternation among lawmakers and veterans.\n\nThe bill passed late Wednesday ended a stalemate created last month, when hard-line conservatives pushed Republican leaders to use the threat of shutdown to block a landmark expansion of federally funded health coverage.\n\nThat campaign, however, succeeded mainly in undermining popular support for the Republican Party. By the end, dozens of anxious GOP lawmakers were ready to give Obama almost exactly what he requested months ago: a bill to fund the government and increase the Treasury Department\u2019s borrowing power with no strings attached.\n\nThe Senate overwhelmingly ratified the deal Wednesday evening, 81 to 18, with more than half of Senate Republicans voting yes. A few hours later, the House followed suit, approving the measure 285 to 144. Eighty-seven Republicans joined a united Democratic caucus in approving the measure, allowing Congress to meet a critical Treasury Department deadline with one day to spare.\n\n[Related: How Congress voted]\n\nObama signed the measure into law shortly after midnight,reopening parks and monuments across the nation, restoring government services and putting furloughed federal employees back on the job, many of them in the Washington region.\n\nIn his remarks Thursday morning, Obama said the shutdown and the threat of a U.S. default probably slowed economic growth, set back hiring and increased borrowing costs, adding to deficit that has been shrinking.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a surprise that the American people are completely fed up with Washington,\u201d Obama said. \u201cAt a moment when our economic recovery demands more jobs, more momentum, we\u2019ve got yet another self-inflicted crisis that set our economy back. And for what? There was no economic rationale for all of this.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cProbably nothing has done more damage to America\u2019s credibility in the world, our standing with other countries, than the spectacle that we\u2019ve seen these past several weeks. It\u2019s encouraged our enemies, it\u2019s emboldened our competitors, and it\u2019s depressed our friends, who look to us for steady leadership.\u201d\n\nObama predicted that \u201cwe\u2019ll bounce back from this,\u201d but he cautioned that it \u201cwon\u2019t be easy.\u201d He said, \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of noise out there, and the pressure from the extremes affect how lot of members of Congress see the day-to-day work that\u2019s supposed to be done here.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo let\u2019s work together to make government work better instead of treating it like an enemy or purposely making it work worse,\u201d Obama said. \u201cDon\u2019t break what our predecessors spent over two centuries building.\u201d\n\nHe said he had a simple message \u201cfor all the dedicated and patriotic federal workers\u201d who were furloughed or worked without pay during the shutdown: \u201cThank you. Thanks for your service. Welcome back. What you do is important. It matters. You defend our country overseas. You deliver benefits to our troops, who have earned them, when they come home. You guard our borders. You protect our civil rights. You help businesses grow and gain footholds in overseas markets. You protect the air we breathe and the water our children drink, and you push the boundaries of science and space, and you guide hundreds of thousands of people each day through the glories of this country.\u201d\n\nBut Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), a leading opponent of Obama\u2019s health-care law, declined to rule out another shutdown over the issue. \u201cI will continue to do anything to stop the train wreck that is Obamacare,\u201d Cruz told ABC News on Thursday. Pressed on whether he would rule out a second shutdown, he said only that he would \u201cstand with the American people working to stop Obamacare.\u201d\n\nThe measure Obama signed into law early Thursday guarantees federal workers back pay for time spent at home, aids flood-ravaged Colorado and provides extra cash for fighting wildfires in the West. And it grants the D.C. government, which relies on Congress to approve its budget, authority to manage its own affairs through the 2014 fiscal year.\n\nEnforcement of the debt limit is suspended until Feb. 7, setting up another confrontation over the national debt sometime in March, independent analysts estimated. Meanwhile, federal agencies are funded through Jan. 15, when they might shut down again unless lawmakers resolve a continuing dispute over deep automatic spending cuts known as the sequester.\n\n\u201cRepublicans and Democrats in Congress have come together around an agreement that will reopen our government and remove the threat of default from our economy,\u201d Obama said Wednesday. \u201cWe can begin to lift this cloud of uncertainty and unease from our businesses and from the American people.\u201d\n\nSenate Budget Committee Chairman Patty Murray (D-Wash.) met over breakfast Thursday morning with her House counterpart, Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), to start a new round of talks aimed at averting another crisis. The ranking minority members of each committee, Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) and Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), also participated in the meeting.\n\nRyan told reporters that the lawmakers \u201chad a very good conversation\u201d and agreed that their goal was \u201cto do good for the American people, to get this debt under control, to do smart deficit reduction and to do things that we think can grow the economy and get people back to work.\u201d\n\nMurray said the group was determined to address \u201cthe challenge that has been handed to us over the coming few short weeks.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe believe that there is common ground in showing the American people that as Congress we can work and make sure our economy is growing and that people are back to work and that we can do the job we were sent here to do,\u201d Murray said. \u201cTo find common ground between our two budget resolutions and set a path forward for Congress to work on.\u201d\n\nObama on Wednesday night repeated his vow to work with Republicans to rein in a national debt that remains at historically high levels.\n\n\u201cWith the shutdown behind us and budget committees forming, we now have an opportunity to focus on a sensible budget that is responsible, that is fair, and that helps hardworking people all across this country,\u201d Obama said at the White House.\n\nFew held out hope that the talks would yield an ambitious plan to overhaul the tax code or restructure federal health and retirement programs, the biggest drivers of future borrowing. But there were signs that Republicans may be more inclined to compromise and less inclined to follow what Rep. Aaron Schock (R-Ill.) called \u201cthe fringe elements\u201d of the GOP.\n\n\u201cThe reality is there\u2019s a much larger population within our caucus that recognizes reality for what it is,\u201d said Schock, who represents the middle-America town of Peoria. \u201cAt the end of the day, whatever we pass will have to be a bipartisan bill. The sooner that our conference recognizes that we\u2019re going to have to negotiate with the other side, the more we can get done.\u201d\n\nThe fight over the health-care law that many call Obamacare originated on the Senate side of the Capitol, with Sens. Cruz and Mike Lee (R-Utah), as well as former senator Jim DeMint (R-S.C.), who now heads the conservative Heritage Foundation. Cruz and Lee voted against Wednesday\u2019s agreement, as did GOP presidential hopefuls Sens. Marco Rubio (Fla.) and Rand Paul (Ky.).\n\nHowever, Boehner and the Republican-controlled House waged the fiercer battle, passing bill after bill to defund, delay and otherwise undercut the Affordable Care Act, only to watch those bills die in the Democratic-controlled Senate.\n\nCruz rejected the idea that Republicans had won nothing during the six-week fight. While the measure contained just one small adjustment to the health-care law \u2014 strengthening safeguards against fraud among recipients of federal health-insurance subsidies \u2014 Cruz said the debate succeeded in calling attention to the harm he asserts the law is causing consumers, employers and the U.S. economy.\n\n\u201cWe saw the House of Representatives take a courageous stand, listening to the American people,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cHad Senate Republicans united and supported House Republicans, the outcome of this, I believe, would have been very, very different.\u201d\n\nStill, the price the House paid for waging what many Republicans saw as an unwinnable fight was ultimately devastating. Boehner had counseled against shutting down the government as recently as late August, fearing a backlash among voters that quickly materialized in public opinion polls.\n\nYanked to the right, Boehner tried repeatedly to satisfy Cruz and his allies. He made a last-ditch effort Tuesday to rally his troops around a measure that would have eked out two minor health-care victories: repeal of a tax on medical devices that helps finance the Affordable Care Act and elimination of employer-provided health-insurance subsidies for lawmakers, their aides and administration officials. The subsidies, long available to all federal workers, have been derided by conservative commentators as a \u201cspecial exemption\u201d now that lawmakers are required to get insurance through the new health-care exchanges.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t enough. Conservative lawmakers demanded more concessions. More moderate Republicans complained that the plan would never pass the Senate.\n\nOn Tuesday night, with House Republicans bitterly divided and Boehner himself badly weakened, the effort collapsed. By Wednesday, Boehner and McConnell had no choice but to seal a deal with Reid or run the risk of inviting economic calamity.\n\n[Related: The end of Boehner\u2019s speakership?]\n\nIn the House, the vote was eerily similar to the last fiscal showdown with Democrats. During the brief debate, not a single member of the GOP leadership team spoke in favor the bill. That left House Appropriations Chairman Harold Rogers (R-Ky.) alone among senior Republicans to publicly champion the bill, just as Ways and Means Chairman Dave Camp (R-Mich.) had been during the \u201cfiscal cliff\u201d vote on New Year\u2019s Day.\n\n\n\nIt ended with a bizarre moment, when a House stenographer ran to a microphone and began shouting religious messages. She was forcibly removed from the chamber.\n\nIn the Senate, McConnell, a wily tactician unaccustomed to surrender, tried to salvage some sense of accomplishment. As he and Reid announced the deal at midday Wednesday on the Senate floor, McConnell noted that the measure would maintain current spending levels, \u201cprotecting the government spending reductions that both parties agreed to under the Budget Control Act\u201d of 2011.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s been a top priority for me and my colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle,\u201d McConnell said.\n\nBut Democrats quickly said they would seek to roll back those cuts before the next round of sequester reductions goes into effect Jan. 15. Meanwhile, many Republicans lamented that the misguided attack on the health-care law had cost the party a shot at forcing Democrats to consider a serious debt-reduction plan.\n\n\u201cThis package is a joke compared to what we could have gotten if we had a more reasonable approach,\u201d said Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) \u201cFor the party, this is a moment of self-evaluation. We are going to assess how we got here. If we continue down this path, we are really going to hurt the Republican Party long term.\u201d\n\nDemocrats, for their part, quietly recorded a partisan victory. But after a shutdown and debt-limit fight estimated to have sucked as much as $20 billion out of the U.S. economy, there was no celebration.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m tired,\u201d Reid said after the Senate voted Wednesday night. \u201cConcluding this crisis is historic. But let\u2019s be honest: This was pain inflicted on the nation for no good reason.\n\n\u201cWe cannot \u2014 we cannot, cannot \u2014 make the same mistakes again.\u201d\n\nLeah Binkovitz, Jackie Kucinich and David A.
