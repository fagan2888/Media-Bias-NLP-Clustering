LUBBOCK, TX—According to the Affordable Care Act, beginning in 2015, all employers with over 100 employees are subject to offering insurance to everybody who works over 30 hours a week. If they fail to do so, they will be fined $2,000 per employee.





That means employers like Lubbock ISD, with over 3500 employees, will have to shell out thousands of dollars to help cover health insurance for eligible substitute teachers. LISD said their 600 active substitute teachers will be receiving a letter in the mail next week, outlining the benefit plan and eligibility requirements.





Currently, many of the substitute teachers that work for LISD are students at Texas Tech or retired teachers that already have an insurance plan.





“Our legal responsibility is to offer insurance to these people, whether they accept it or not,” Executive Director of Risk Management at LISD, Bill Tarro said. “Of course all school districts are doing this, and quite honestly, from what I understand, not very many people are taking the offer of the insurance.”





If substitute teachers decide to accept the offer of insurance, they must be working a minimum of 16 days a month.





“ We have around 600 subs, and we ask our substitutes to work at least 4 days a month. It's a requirement,” Rick Rodriguez, Assistant Superintendent of Human Resources at LISD said. “If they don't meet that requirement, then we remove them from our rosters, because we really want folks that want to go out and work in our schools.”





Rodriguez said he is hopeful this will bring in more substitute teachers.
