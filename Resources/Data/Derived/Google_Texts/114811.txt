Terrence Williams, the 23-year-old St. Louis native who shared his inspiring story with The Daily Signal earlier this week, will appear on Sean Hannity’s Fox News show today at 10 p.m. ET. Yesterday, he spoke to The Blaze’s Dana Loesch (watch clip above) about the role God played in his decision to clean up the city.

Following the riots in Ferguson, Mo., last week, Williams set out with a garbage bag to repair a city ravaged by riots and fires when a grand jury decided not to indict police officer Darren Wilson for the shooting death of Michael Brown.

A photo of Williams cleaning up Ferguson was captured in a tweet by Huffington Post reporter Ryan J. Reilly.

Last weekend, The Daily Signal’s Jamie Jackson traveled to Ferguson to interview Williams—and discovered some surprising news in the process. Watch our video below to hear his story.
