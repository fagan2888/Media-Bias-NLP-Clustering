To the editor,

Moderator Anderson Cooper lambasted Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders for having supported the Sandinistas during the Oct. 12 debate on CNN. It was they who led the revolt that defeated the 46-year old Somoza dictatorship in Nicaragua in 1979.

Mr. Cooper should have disclosed that while in college, he spent two summers working for the CIA during the Reagan administration at a time when the agency was violating federal law by supporting the Contras, including mining Nicaraguan waters and trying to buy arms for the Contras from Iran. Mr. Cooper also suggested that Mr. Sanders was rendered unelectable for having applied for conscientious objector status during the Vietnam War. Ah, the sins of youth, like Hillary Clintonâ€™s start in politics as a supporter of Barry Goldwater for president! And, I seem to recall that both Bill Clinton and George W. Bush were not exactly wild to be drafted and sent to Vietnam.
