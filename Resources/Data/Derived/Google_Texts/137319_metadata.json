Cohee, 44, 9805 S. Trivoli Road, will appear in Chief Judge Steve Kouri\u2019s courtroom Tuesday after being charged with two counts of threatening a public official for two acts this year when he first threatened the dog and then the life of Circuit Judge Jodi Hoos.\n\nCohee allegedly knew of Hoos as he hunted on land near her rural Peoria County home. The charges allege he threatened Hoos\u2019 dog on Jan. 3. Then on Feb. 19, he allegedly made a written threat on Hoos\u2019 life.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t appear he has had a case in front of Hoos, who recently was appointed to the bench. The Peoria County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office, while Hoos was an assistant state\u2019s attorney there, prosecuted the three people who participated in a botched robbery that led to the death of Cohee\u2019s father, James Cohee, at his Lake Camelot home on Aug. 25, 2012.\n\nAll three were convicted and later sentenced to prison.\n\nThis is the second time Cohee has been charged with such a crime. In 2007, he was charged with the same offense for threatening now-retired Brian Nemenoff by calling his office and leaving a partially incoherent but threatening message. He was later found not guilty by reason of insanity after a judge from another county handled the matter.\n\nThe same will happen this time. Kouri will handle the case until another judge from outside the 10th Circuit which includes Peoria, Tazewell, Stark, Marshall and Putnam counties, takes over to avoid any appearance of bias. A court order entered Sunday indicates that if Cohee were to post enough bail, that he must wear an electronic monitoring bracelet as a condition of his bond.\n\nAndy Kravetz can be reached at 686-3283 and akravetz@pjstar.com.
