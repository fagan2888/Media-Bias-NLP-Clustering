At the same time, there was a 523,000-person drop in full-time workers, the first decline since October.\n\n\u201cIt is unusual,\u201d said Stuart Hoffman, chief economist at PNC Financial Services Group. But he said it could be noise. And he notes that most of the part-time rise in June was not in those who want to find full-time work but couldn\u2019t, and instead in those who voluntarily opted to do so.\n\nOne concern with the Affordable Care Act was that some small employers might opt to get around the 50-person work requirement by replacing full-time workers with part-timers.\n\nThat said, over the past 12 months, 10,000 new part-time jobs have been created \u2014 versus 2.12 million full-time jobs.\n\nAnd looking at the survey of establishments, it was high-paying sectors that were creating jobs in June. \u201cThese are not McDonald\u2019s, Mickey Mouse kind of jobs,\u201d Hoffman said. \u201cThis is a better-quality jobs story.\u201d\n\nHoffman said he wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the number of part-time workers comes back to more normal readings in July and August.\n\n\u2013 Steve Goldstein\n\nFollow @mktwgoldstein\n\n\n\nFollow @capitolreport\n\nAlso read: \u2018Yabadabadu\u2019 and more jobs reactions\n\nU.S. sees another boom in jobs growth in June", "article_metadata": {"article.author": "Steve Goldstein", "description": "One interesting nugget in the June jobs report was the rise in the number of people who worked part-time.", "application-name": "MarketWatch.com", "article.page": "Capitol Report Blog", "og": {"site_name": "Marketwatch", "description": "One interesting nugget in the June jobs report was the rise in the number of people who worked part-time.", "title": "Part-time work jumps in June by nearly 800,000", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/capitolreport/2014/07/03/part-time-work-jumps-in-june-by-nearly-800000/", "image": {"width": 569, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-CL430_partti_MG_20140703101319.jpg", "height": 398}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Marketwatch.com", "description": "One interesting nugget in the June jobs report was the rise in the number of people who worked part-time.", "title": "Part-time work jumps in June by nearly 800,000", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/capitolreport/2014/07/03/part-time-work-jumps-in-june-by-nearly-800000/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-CL430_partti_MG_20140703101319.jpg"}, "site": "MarketWatch", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.published": "2014-07-03T10:25:42-04:00", "article.access": "free", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "msapplication-tooltip": "MarketWatch", "article.type": "Capitol Report", "article.id": "BL-MWEB-6554", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/capitolreport/2014/07/03/part-time-work-jumps-in-june-by-nearly-800000/", "app_id": 283204329838}, "article.created": "2014-07-03T10:25:42-04:00", "article.updated": "2014-07-03T10:25:42-04:00", "keywords": "economy,jobs,part-time", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch", "image_count": 2}, "article.section": "Blogs", "article.headline": "Part-time work jumps in June by nearly 800,000", "msapplication-task": "name=SmartMoney;action-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/;icon-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/favicon.ico", "news_keywords": "economy,jobs,part-time"}, "article_summary": "That said, over the past 12 months, 10,000 new part-time jobs have been created \u2014 versus 2.12 million full-time jobs.\nAt the same time, there was a 523,000-person drop in full-time workers, the first decline since October.\nAnd he notes that most of the part-time rise in June was not in those who want to find full-time work but couldn\u2019t, and instead in those who voluntarily opted to do so.\nOne interesting nugget in the June jobs report was the rise in the number of people who worked part-time.\n\u201cThis is a better-quality jobs story.\u201dHoffman said he wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the number of part-time workers comes back to more normal readings in July and August."}
