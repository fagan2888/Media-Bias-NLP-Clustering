My question was straightforward: What's the secret of the front-runner's appeal?\n\nYes, Trump is attractive to voters who are angry \u2014 angry about the economy, illegal immigration and \u201cpolitical correctness.\u201d And some of his supporters feel threatened by racial diversity, to put it mildly. But that's only part of the answer.\n\nWhat Trump's supporters also hear from their champion is a message of unbridled optimism \u2014 a promise that he can repair the economy, bring jobs back and Make America Great Again.\n\nTrump is running as a candidate of Hope and Change.\n\nJust listen.\n\n\u201cWe're going to make our country rich again,\u201d Trump promised last week in Palm Beach, Fla. \u201cIf I win \u2026 Apple and all of these great companies will be making their product in the United States, not in China.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe're going to bring back all our jobs,\u201d he told voters in Tampa. \u201cWe're going to end up having great, great healthcare \u2026 for a fraction of the price.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrust me,\u201d he added. \u201cI know about healthcare.\u201d\n\nAnd his over-the-top, all-purpose promise: \u201cWe're going to win so much, you're going to get tired of winning.\u201d\n\nTrump knows exactly what he's doing. \u201cMake America Great Again \u2014 that's optimism,\u201d he said last month. \u201cSome people say, \u2018Oh, such negativity.' It's just the opposite.\u201d\n\nThe voters who put their faith in the real estate promoter seem to think Trump can fix almost anything, including the economy, healthcare, schools, veterans' benefits, military strength and U.S. relations with Israel. Trump, they believe, will sweep all obstacles out of the way and impose simple answers on complex problems.\n\nHis supporters didn't all fit the stereotype of the angry blue-collar voter either. Sure, some rallygoers scowled and muttered vulgarities when asked if they would talk with someone from the mainstream media. But others were talkative, cheerful and educated.\n\n\u201cTrump's not a politician, he's a businessman, and that's what America needs,\u201d Norm Holt, a genial retired firefighter from Largo, Fla., told me. \u201cHe can get more done than a politician can.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe's whip-smart, he's a leader,\u201d said Tina Collier, a retiree from Arlington, Va. \u201cHe's going to do things other people haven't done.\u201d\n\nThe idea that businesspeople are better qualified than politicians to run the country may be an illusion -- but Trump didn't invent it.\n\n\u201cI'm just ready for change,\u201d said Allison Polikoff, a middle school teacher from Plantation, Fla. \u201cI think he can do a lot for education, too.\u201d\n\nSome of this sounds like simple frustration. If a generation's worth of politicians hasn't solved the country's problems, maybe it's simply time to give someone else a chance. Besides, as Ben Carson said last week, \u201cWe're only looking at four years.\u201d\n\nBut there's also a dose of magical thinking born of the old American ideal of entrepreneur as all-purpose problem solver.\n\nTrump isn't the first businessman to offer his commercial prowess as proof that he can run the government.\n\nHerbert Hoover campaigned for president in 1928 on his success as a mining engineer and executive. Data processing mogul H. Ross Perot ran as a third-party candidate in 1992 saying, \u201cMy strength is creating jobs and fixing things.\u201d\n\nAnd the Republicans' last presidential nominee, in 2012, was a former venture capitalist who argued that business experience was a \u201cbasic qualification\u201d for the presidency. That was Mitt Romney, who's now trying to rally Republican opposition to Trump.\n\nThe idea that businesspeople are better qualified than politicians to run the country may be an illusion \u2014 but Trump didn't invent it.\n\nThere's a potential lesson here for anyone, Republican or Democrat, who hopes to keep Trump away from the White House.\n\nHis rivals in the GOP have been trying to dent his appeal by pointing out that he's not a real conservative, that he's needlessly divisive, and that he has a record of demeaning women. All true \u2014 but Trump supporters don't seem to care.\n\nPerhaps it would be more effective to argue that Trump isn't the business genius he claims and that his proposed solutions are bogus. It would be better, in other words, to take on the validity of his optimism.\n\nMost of Trump's promises are an amalgam of nonsense and fantasy.\n\nHis plan for reviving manufacturing jobs is a 35% tariff on automobile imports; he never mentions that the cost would be paid by American consumers, even before the trade war that would ensue. His skimpy plan for \u201cgreat, great healthcare\u201d doesn't add up either; nonpartisan analysts say it would insure fewer people and cost more money than Obamacare. And so on.\n\nRomney tried his hand at bubble-popping earlier this month. \u201cDonald Trump is a phony, a fraud,\u201d he said on March 3. \u201cHis promises are as worthless as a degree from Trump University. He's playing the American public for suckers.\u201d\n\nThat's the right message. Now it's up to Ted Cruz and John Kasich, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders to make it.\n\nBecause if Trump wins the presidency, even his most well-meaning supporters will soon discover that he's a quack.\n\nAs Trump might put it: Sad!\n\ndoyle.mcmanus@latimes.com\n\nTwitter: @doylemcmanus\n\nFollow the Opinion section on Twitter @latimesopinion and Facebook\n\nMORE OP-EDS:\n\nHistory shows Trump's 'beautiful' border wall would be worthless\n\nThe Zika virus doesn't respect borders.
