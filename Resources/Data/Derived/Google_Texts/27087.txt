A large fire in Fort Collins early Thursday caused more than $1,000,000 to a commercial building, the Poudre Fire Authority said in a news release.

The first call came in at 4:43 a.m. about a fire at the Signs Now business on Riverside Avenue in northeast Fort Collins.

The first firefighters on scene saw flames that quickly went into the roof. They couldn’t get inside safely and fought the blaze defensively until it was under control.

“The business suffered heavy fire, smoke and heat damage throughout,” the fire authority said, estimating the loss at more than $1,000,000.

Investigators are working to determine a cause.

Fort Collins police said in a news release Thursday afternoon that officers responding to the scene found a door at Signs Now that appeared to have been broken open.

Also, a burglary was reported a short time later at Painter’s Supply, a business on the same street.

Detectives are exploring the possibility that the burgarly was related to the fire, police said.

Anyone with information about the fire or the burglary is asked to call Det. Kyle Bendzsa at 970-221-6577 or remain anonymous by calling Crime Stoppers of Larimer County at 970-221-6868.
