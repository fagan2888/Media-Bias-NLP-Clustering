But with the Supreme Court's majority decision preserving Obamacare, the term gains new luster in Washington's lexicon.\n\nJessica Ellis (r.) holds a sign that says 'yay 4 ACA,' as she and other supporters of the Affordable Care Act react with cheers as the opinion for health care is reported outside of the Supreme Court in Washington on Thursday.\n\nInartful: The polite political word for \u201cdumb,\u201d especially when an elected official and/or his or her spokespeople grope to explain something they said earlier.\n\nSupreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts\u2019s opinion in the King v. Burwell case essentially preserving the Affordable Care Act (aka Obamacare) shed new light on the art of \u201cinartful.\u201d Roberts wrote that the original law \u201ccontains more than a few examples of inartful drafting,\u201d which he and five other justices said necessitated the court to step in and uphold the creation of the state exchanges that the law established.\n\nBut \u201cinartful\u201d \u2013 along with its linguistic cousins \u201ccounterproductive\u201d and \u201cI misspoke\u201d \u2013 has long been a fixture in politics. The late language expert William Safire noted in 1985 that \u201cartful\u201d originally meant \u201cadroit,\u201d then evolved into being synonymous with crafty or wily. \u201cThus, with artful meaning \u2018wily,\u2019 inartful would mean \u2018not wily\u2019 and would be a compliment,\u201d Mr. Safire wrote. However, to use it as another way of saying \u201cI goofed\u201d \u2013 as New York Gov. Mario Cuomo did at the time \u2013 \u201cmakes no sense,\u201d Safire added. \u201cDepending on his specific intent, he could have chosen insensitive, cruel, thoughtless or even impolitic.\u201d\n\nRecommended: How much do you know about the US Constitution? A quiz.\n\nIn 2008, Ben Smith, then of Politico, wrote that it \u201cis becoming a bit of a favorite campaign word\u201d after Barack Obama refused to rebuke Gen. Wesley Clark for saying that Arizona GOP Sen. John McCain\u2019s military experience wasn\u2019t relevant to the presidency. And conservatives jumped on Obama for being inartful in 2014 when the president said \u201cwe don\u2019t have a strategy yet\u201d for dealing with Islamic militants.\n\nMore recently, Republican Scott Walker\u2019s evasion of a British reporter\u2019s question about whether he believed in evolution prompted this headline from Washington Post opinion columnist Richard Cohen\u2019s castigation of the Wisconsin governor: \u201cWalker\u2019s Inartful Dodge in London.\u201d Another Republican, Ben Carson, in walking back an earlier assertion endorsing the ownership of semi-automatic weapons for people who live \u201cout in the country somewhere by yourself,\u201d called that comment \u201cperhaps a little inartful.\u201d\n\nHillary Clinton also turned to the word in the aftermath of the furor she caused last year when she lamented that she and her husband were \u201cdead broke\u201d upon leaving the White House in 2001. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have said the five or so words that I said, but my inartful use of those few words doesn\u2019t change who I am, what I\u2019ve stood for my entire life, what I stand for today,\u201d Mrs. Clinton told PBS.\n\n\u201cInartful\u201d has been used sporadically in congressional debates over the last two decades, according to the Sunlight Foundation\u2019s ever-helpful CapitolWords.org. Democrats have deployed it slightly more often than Republicans.\n\nChuck McCutcheon and David Mark write their \"Speaking Politics\" blog exclusively for Politics Voices.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.content.id": "b001d692cdcb4d486d053bab034f0a8c", "sailthru.author": "Chuck McCutcheon,David Mark", "description": "'Inartful' \u2013 along with its linguistic cousins 'counterproductive' and 'I misspoke' \u2013 has long been a fixture in politics.
