Welker will not be cleared to play until the NFL signs off on the agreement, too, which is expected on Saturday.\n\n\u201cThis is a historic moment for our players and our league,\u201d NFLPA president Eric Winston said in a statement. \u201cWe have collectively bargained drug policies that will keep the game clean and safe, but also provide our players with an unprecedented level of fairness and transparency. Players should be proud of their union for standing up for what was best for the game.\u201d\n\nBut even if he can play, he may be among the inactives.

Welker had been cleared to play several weeks ago by an independent doctor.\n\nWith approval of the new policy, Welker\u2019s suspension is lifted because his positive test has been moved from the jurisdiction of the performance enhancement policy \u2014 where four-game suspensions are issued to first-time offenders \u2014 to the substance-abuse policy, where first-time offenders are essentially placed on probation but aren\u2019t suspended until a second infraction.\n\nAmong the other highlights, according to a statement from the NFLPA:\n\nNeutral arbitration: An independent arbitrator will hear appeals for positive test violations for both substances of abuse and performance enhancing drugs. Both the NFL and NFLPA will select, approve and pay for three to five arbitrators.\n\nAn independent arbitrator will hear appeals for positive test violations for both substances of abuse and performance enhancing drugs.
