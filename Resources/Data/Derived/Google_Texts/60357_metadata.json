Brian Shiozawa said he and a group of five other officials have been meeting regularly to come up with a solution regarding Medicaid expansion, a solution that will work for Utah.\n\nShiozawa, who is also a medical doctor, said Medicaid expansion is vital for the state.\n\n\u201cWe have over a hundred thousand patients, who would be beneficiaries of this, who come to the ER,\u201d Shiozawa said. \u201cIt\u2019s their only source of care because they can\u2019t get in anywhere else, and we as citizens and as taxpayers already pay for their care when they can\u2019t. Most of them can\u2019t afford it, and these bills are just huge.\u201d\n\nRepublican Rep. Edward Redd said he wants to keep Utahns healthy. He said many are put in a position where the only way they can pay for care is by quitting their job and taking disability.\n\n\u201cWhich I think is a really horrible situation,\u201d Redd said. \u201cMost people that I take care of that are on disability because of their medical problems would prefer to work.\u201d\n\nDemocrat Sen. Luz Escamilla said she would ideally like to see full Medicaid expansion, but she said the state legislature is unlikely to vote for it. She said she would have to review any compromise before voting for it.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Utah News", "description": "The recent Supreme Court ruling on the Affordable Care Act has brought the question of Medicaid expansion in Utah to the forefront of the state legislature", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://upr.org/post/supreme-court-ruling-brings-out-medicaid-discussion", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/upr/files/styles/medium/public/201506/hand-holding-a-stethoscope.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The recent Supreme Court ruling on the Affordable Care Act has brought the question of Medicaid expansion in Utah to the forefront of the state legislature", "title": "Supreme Court Ruling Brings Out Medicaid Discussion"}, "story_id": 418640099, "twitter": {"site": "@utahpublicradio", "card": "summary"}, "author": "Chris Campbell", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Supreme Court Ruling Brings Out Medicaid Discussion"}, "nid": 58902, "datePublished": "2015-06-29", "keywords": "Health", "wordCount": 272, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce49d\"", "article_summary": "The recent Supreme Court ruling on the Affordable Care Act has brought the question of Medicaid expansion in Utah to the forefront of the state legislature.\nShiozawa, who is also a medical doctor, said Medicaid expansion is vital for the state.\nRepublican Sen.
