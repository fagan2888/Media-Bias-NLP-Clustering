His office released a statement from Senator Grassley regarding his vote.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of talk about the negative impact of not raising the debt limit, but there\u2019s too little focus on the negative consequences of ignoring the $17 trillion debt. Government spending has exploded since 2008, increasing the national debt by $6 trillion. Obamacare is a drag on the economy and hurting workers\u2019 ability to find full-time jobs. Yet the President refuses to lead for fiscal responsibility, both short and long term, even with a government shutdown. This agreement raises the debt limit with no action on the debt. It\u2019s a missed opportunity for forcing action to limit government and increase economic opportunities. America needs the President to roll up his sleeves and work with members of Congress to address the long-term fiscal problems of our country. Our grandkids depend on it.\u201d\n\nPhoto credit: Gage Skidmore via Flickr (CC-By-SA 2.0)", "article_metadata": {"shareaholic": {"site_name": "Caffeinated Thoughts", "language": "en-US", "url": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/2013/10/chuck-grassley-government-shutdown-deal-missed-opportunity-limit-government/", "article_author_name": "Caffeinated Thoughts", "image": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/chuck-grassley.jpg", "site_id": "965f58835b5900850067f65116487024", "article_published_time": "2013-10-17T16:03:40+00:00", "shareable_page": "true", "article_modified_time": "2016-05-24T19:06:13+00:00", "keywords": "chuck grassley, government spending, national debt, obamacare, iowa news & politics, u.s. politics", "wp_version": "7.7.1.0"}, "description": "Sen.
