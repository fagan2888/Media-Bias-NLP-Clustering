They detonate bombs and shoot civilians in Grand Central Terminal; they take hostages at Macy\u2019s in Herald Square. Too late, authorities realize that the hostage-taking is a diversion allowing co-conspirators to massacre people in luxury hotels dozens of blocks away. The New York Police Department, outwitted and overmatched, quickly runs out of personnel to deploy.\n\nThe events are fictional, but the failure was real enough, as Micah Zenko recounts in his grimly well-timed book, \u201cRed Team.\u201d It was a result of a simulation the NYPD carried out in 2008, a week after 10 members of the Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorist group struck Mumbai in a horrific assault that hit luxury hotels, a train station, a Jewish community center, a cafe and other spots, using bombs and AK-47s to kill about 170 people. \u201cIt was considered such a potentially catastrophic scenario that additional exercises modeled on Mumbai were conducted in the following two years,\u201d Zenko writes.\n\nIt\u2019s not entirely fair to read a book four years in the making in light of events that happen to occur at the time of its publication. But it\u2019s certainly tempting. The coordinated Islamic State attacks in Paris on Nov. 13, which killed 129 people, have not just unleashed a transnational manhunt and the start of a \u201cpitiless\u201d war, in the words of French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande. They\u2019ve also produced second-guessing about strategy and intelligence, as well as worries that soft targets around the world \u2014 including in Washington \u2014 could suffer similar tragedies.\n\n(Basic Books)\n\nSo, how to anticipate the unthinkable? Well, you could hire people to think of it. Zenko, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, lays out the uneven history and potential of \u201cred teams\u201d \u2014 small, expert groups of outsiders enlisted to find vulnerabilities, shake up preconceived notions and imagine the unimaginable, all in an effort to improve security and thinking throughout the military, intelligence and corporate worlds.\n\nThe tale begins centuries ago, when the Vatican established the \u201cdevil\u2019s advocate\u201d to argue against proposed canonizations; ranges to the Cold War, when the Rand Corp. and the Pentagon assigned red teams to anticipate Soviet strategies and negotiating tactics; and expands in the post 9/11-era, when the CIA created its Red Cell team to \u201ctell me things others don\u2019t,\u201d in the words of then-CIA Director George Tenet.\n\nZenko interviews more than 200 experienced red-teamers, including white-hat hackers, senior corporate executives, former CIA directors and retired four-star generals, to assess the prospects for this small industry. Turns out, they\u2019re an odd bunch. \u201cRed teamers are weird,\u201d Zenko writes. \u201cThey tend to be loners, mavericks, and arrogant, which is exactly why they think and act differently \u2014 the most vital skill of a red teamer.\u201d They need a deep cultural understanding of the institutions they\u2019re assisting, yet should remain independent of them. They must be talented writers and briefers, be skeptical of authority, have held multiple jobs in their fields, and be intimately familiar with \u201clarge systemic failures, which helps them envision future failures.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Zenko\u2019s most compelling stories are of failures, cases when red teams were not used or when their efforts were ignored, misused or precooked. He cites the after-action report on Operation Eagle Claw \u2014 President Jimmy Carter\u2019s aborted rescue attempt for the American hostages in Iran \u2014 which found that Pentagon planners had \u201creviewed and critiqued their own product for feasibility and soundness as they went along.\u201d (This underscores a key rationale for red-teaming: \u201cYou cannot grade your own homework,\u201d Zenko reiterates.) After the 9/11 attacks, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission \u201cwas found to be conducting fraudulent testing of simulated terrorist attacks\u201d against commercial nuclear plants, Zenko writes, including by giving a year\u2019s advance notice so sites could beef up security. And in 2010, the Department of Health and Human Services hired McKinsey & Co. to \u201cpressure-test\u201d the Affordable Care Act\u2019s federal marketplace, only to disregard warnings of likely glitches in the HealthCare.gov site. (Ask Kathleen Sebelius what happened next.)\n\n[Inside the mind of the Pentagon\u2019s \u2018Yoda\u2019]\n\nZenko also highlights a 2002 war game that formed part of the Millennium Challenge, a congressionally mandated exercise aimed at exploring the military\u2019s operational readiness for near-term conflicts. Widely considered to resemble the operational plan to disarm and depose Saddam Hussein in Iraq, Zenko writes, the effort was also meant to showcase the high-tech military transformation that Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld championed. However, the red-team leader, retired Marine Lt. Gen. Paul Van Riper, a skeptic of those efforts, quickly overwhelmed the simulated U.S. fleet with a barrage of missiles and speedboat suicide attacks. \u201cThe whole thing was over in five, maybe ten minutes,\u201d he said.\n\nExcept it wasn\u2019t. Restrictions were placed on the red team\u2019s subsequent actions \u2014 such as forcing it to position its air defenses in the open so the blue team could easily destroy them \u2014 that compromised the exercise. Van Riper sent a blistering e-mail to several military colleagues that was promptly leaked. (\u201cFixed war games? General says Millennium Challenge \u201902 was \u2018scripted,\u2019 \u201d read the Army Times headline.) The problem, Zenko writes, is that both the red team and the military leadership had preconceived objectives going in, undercutting the exercise.\n\nThe author highlights successes as well, notably the red-teaming of the Osama bin Laden raid in 2011 \u2014 both of the underlying intelligence and the logistics of the SEAL mission itself. Various analysts placed the probability of the al-Qaeda leader hiding out in the compound in Abbotabad, Pakistan, at 75 percent, 60 percent and even 40 percent, leaving the president to conclude that he basically had a coin-toss decision. \u201cWe were at 0 percent for a decade,\u201d counterterrorism official Andrew Liepman explains, \u201cso going from 0 to 50 percent meant a lot to everyone.\u201d And the red-teaming of the raid prepared the SEALs for multiple eventualities, including, as transpired, the malfunction of one of their helicopters.\n\n[Osama bin Laden\u2019s bookshelf reveals a conventional wannabe foreign policy wonk]\n\nZenko outlines best practices for red teams, even though, he admits, that very notion is anathema to red teamers, who mistrust rules or guidelines. \u201cWhen you hear \u2018best practices,\u2019 run for your lives,\u201d says retired Army Col. Gregory Fontenot, director of the \u201cRed Team University\u201d at Fort Leavenworth, Kan., where officers receive training in how to think critically, avoid groupthink and improve cultural empathy. Perhaps most essential to red-team effectiveness is that the boss of the organization undergoing the red-team effort must buy in to the idea, otherwise the team will be marginalized and underfunded, its findings ignored.\n\nThough sympathetic to his subject, Zenko is careful not to oversell. There can be a faux sex appeal to red teams. He notes that the CIA\u2019s Red Cell team has cultivated \u201can air of mystery,\u201d in part because of the eye-catching titles of its internal memos \u2014 \u201cThe View from Usama\u2019s Cave,\u201d for example \u2014 which it deliberately contrasts with the more staid reports of the intelligence community. Zenko says that in 2012, the team\u2019s members even met with Foreign Policy magazine staffers for headline tips. \u201cThey wanted to know how our stuff went viral,\u201d recalls Blake Hounshell, then the magazine\u2019s managing editor. \u201cThe techniques that we considered to be \u2018click bait\u2019 were what they were most interested in.\u201d Not the most encouraging use of tax dollars.\n\nSo, could red-teaming somehow have prevented the Paris attacks? Zenko explains that the NYPD\u2019s Mumbai-style simulation yielded specific improvements in preparedness, so there is hope. But anticipating all potential acts of terrorism is an impossible task, no matter how imaginative a team might be, especially when multiple institutions \u2014 spanning local and national authorities, military and intelligence agencies, and even cultural and sports organizations \u2014 must get involved. Still, Zenko offers a compelling argument for forcing ourselves to think differently, which is ultimately the main purpose of a red team. Even if we won\u2019t know exactly what to expect, we might be better equipped to respond when the unexpected strikes.\n\nRead more from Book Party, including:\n\nReview of \u201cExceptional: Why the World Needs a Powerful America\u201d by Dick Cheney and Liz Cheney\n\nHow an American slacker caught a Russian spy at a New Jersey Hooters\n\nForget ghosts or zombies \u2014 nothing is scarier than what\u2019s in your own mind", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new book goes inside the \"red teams\" that imagine worst-case scenarios for the military, intelligence agencies and corporate world.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "A new book goes inside the \"red teams\" that imagine worst-case scenarios for the military, intelligence agencies and corporate world.", "title": "How to anticipate unthinkable terrorist attacks?
