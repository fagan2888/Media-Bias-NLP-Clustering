It\u2019s a hot topic in national, state and local politics.\n\nWith all that talk, it can be tough to cut through rhetoric that unfortunately has become polarizing since the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010.\n\nWhat I\u2019d like you to do is take a few steps back and see health care for what it truly is.\n\nHealth care is vital to our economy and our well-being. Virginia\u2019s hospitals and health systems are major contributors on both accounts.\n\nHospitals and health systems provide good-paying Virginia jobs (115,000 overall), generate $36 billion in positive annual economic activity, and spend $17 billion on goods and services with local businesses.\n\nHospitals are among the largest employers in the communities they serve, even in regions such as Northern Virginia.\n\nBeyond direct jobs, many local businesses that support the livelihoods of our friends, family, and neighbors are linked to the health care economy.\n\nHospitals\u2019 economic footprints are especially prominent in rural communities, where they provide 17,500 jobs. Each hospital job in rural Virginia supports two additional local economy jobs.\n\nOverall, health care accounts for 1 in 9 Virginia jobs (11 percent of the workforce).\n\nHealth care was one of Virginia\u2019s few employment growth sectors in 2014. U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics forecast a similar story ahead when health care jobs are expected to help propel national job market prosperity.\n\nWhile those numbers are impressive, the real import of hospitals is often only evident when all we want is reassurance that the facility where a loved is receiving medical care has highly-trained staff, and state-of-the-art equipment and facilities necessary to treat them.\n\nAt some point, each of us will need a hospital, whether for a scheduled procedure or an unexpected crisis, a birth in the family or end of life care. Hospitals are there for those moments. There when Ebola strikes. There to treat people after natural disasters, man-made incidents, and acts of God.\n\nThey are there for the insured and uninsured alike. You see, years of government decisions have put unfunded mandates on hospitals that cost them billions.\n\nMedicaid and Medicare, the 50-year-old subsidized insurance programs, reimburse hospitals at rates less than the cost to provide care. A 30-year-old federal law requires hospitals to treat emergency room patients even if they can\u2019t pay.\n\nThose unfunded mandates obligate hospitals to provide substantial amounts of free and discounted care at great expense. That level of government involvement means health care is not a free market system.\n\nVirginia hospitals also face rising federal funding cuts from sequestration and ACA escalating to roughly $1 billion annually by 2021.\n\nAll those burdens jeopardize the jobs, economic and public health benefits hospitals provide. Also threatened is access to health care services and facilities which could become scarce depending on policy outcomes.\n\nProtecting our hospitals as the assets they are requires common sense health care policy measures.\n\nTwo prominent health care issues before the Virginia General Assembly involve extending health care coverage to more Virginians \u2013 sound fiscal analysis shows that is economically prudent \u2013 and protecting a health care law that helps control costs and offset charity care mandates on Virginia\u2019s health care delivery system.\n\nVirginia\u2019s Certificate of Public Need (COPN) law is a review process for proposed new health care facilities, services, and equipment.\n\nEliminating it would weaken health care, allowing some providers to cherry pick the most profitable types of care, in the most profitable regions, leaving less wealthy areas with fewer health care options and forcing hospitals to subsidize money-losing types of care.\n\nA work group the General Assembly ordered to study the issue recommended updating COPN, but concluded the law should remain intact. That is a sensible health care reform plan.\n\nAnother big issue is health care access. Under ACA, states have the option to expand Medicaid so more people are insured. Thirty-one states have done so. Virginia has not, though nearly 400,000 primarily working poor Virginians could benefit. Money for that is available from Washington, funded with health care taxes from Virginia.\n\nSome worry Washington won\u2019t fulfill its promise to fund most costs from the new population, even though Virginia\u2019s budget is built on billions in federal funds that support our roads, schools, police, prisons, you name it.\n\nVirginia hospitals have put forth a proposal to allay fears about state costs from insuring more people by conditionally offering to contribute funds to support health care.\n\nThat approach is flexible enough to backfill existing Medicaid funding, or to expand health care coverage to many more Virginians.\n\nHospitals, not taxpayers, would cover the state\u2019s cost. Drawing down additional federal funds that way would improve the state budget, and enhance the fiscal stability of Virginia\u2019s health care system without costing taxpayers.\n\nThat is a fair bargain when so much is at stake.\n\nSean Connaughton is president and CEO of the Virginia Hospital & Healthcare Association.", "article_metadata": {"description": "By Sean Connaughton\r\n\r\nHealth care is everywhere these days.
