It is the only place where we can go to ride them legally.\n\n\"We have nowhere we can ride them now, so I guess we will just be on them in the streets.\"\n\nCallum Hooley, 15, said he used the centre every Thursday and Saturday evening.\n\nHe started using it after being invited by one of the centre's outreach programmes in 2011.\n\nCallum said he used to ride his bike across playing fields and on the streets before he started going to the Two Wheel Centre.\n\nHe said: \"My brothers and I used the centre and now they have both got full-time jobs as mechanics.\n\n\"You can have a laugh here with people you would not usually meet.\n\n\"I don't know what I am going to do without it.\"\n\nThe council tried to privatise the Two Wheel Centre and Bumps in 2012 and transfer them to East Hull Wheels, a similar scheme in Poorhouse Lane.\n\nThe proposals fell through this year, and the council cabinet decided in October to shut down the projects altogether.\n\nAlthough the East Hull Wheels scheme is still open, it charges more than the Two Wheel Centre.\n\nOne worker, who did not wish to be named, said: \"Everyone is upset that it is closing. The kids, staff and parents are all devastated. There is not another place like this around.\n\n\"They work with young people who are often difficult and who have had antisocial behaviour problems. This place gave them somewhere to turn.\"\n\nA petition against the closures, signed by 2,000 people, has been submitted to the city council and is due to be discussed at the next cabinet meeting.\n\n\u2022 Follow us on Facebook and Twitter\n\n\u2022 Politics news for Hull and East Riding", "article_metadata": {"description": "TEENAGERS say they will be forced to ride their motorbikes in the streets after a youth project closed.
