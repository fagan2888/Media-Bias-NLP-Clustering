Oklahoma Forestry Services says a wildfire burning in northwestern Oklahoma is now 70 percent contained.

The fire being called the 350 Complex Fire has burned about 90 square miles since Tuesday. Investigators believe the fire was started by arcing power lines that touched the dry ground because of gusting winds.

One firefighter was treated for heat exhaustion. No other injuries have been reported.

Emergency management officials estimate the fire has cause more than $2.3 million in damage to private property, public utilities and government facilities in Woodward and Harper counties.

Forestry services said aircraft was being used Sunday to monitor hot spots, but there were no firefighting efforts from the air.
