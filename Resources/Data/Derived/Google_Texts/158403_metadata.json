To prevent her future son from suffering severe neurological damage, Armas\u2019s mother, who was 21 weeks pregnant when the diagnosis was received, underwent prenatal surgery.\n\n>>> Elijah\u2019s Story: A Life Saved Before Birth\n\nPhotojournalist Michael Clancy was sent by USA Today to document the unique procedure, which had been introduced less than two decades prior.\n\nDuring the surgery, Clancy witnessed something remarkable.\n\n\u201cSuddenly, an entire arm thrust out of the opening [of the exposed uterus], then pulled back until just a little hand was showing,\u201d Clancy wrote on his personal blog. \u201cThe doctor reached over and lifted the hand, which reacted and squeezed the doctor\u2019s finger. As if testing for strength, the doctor shook the tiny fist. Samuel held firm.\u201d\n\nFifteen years later, the iconic photograph Clancy captured during that moment continues to inspire hope across the globe.\n\nPhotojournalist Michael Clancy, who identified as pro-choice prior to taking the photo, has since joined the pro-life crusade.\n\nFormer Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee featured Samuel\u2019s story in a 2011 film, \u201cThe Gift of Life.\u201d That same year, Clancy published his book, \u201cHand of Hope: The Story Behind the Picture,\u201d which described the surgery as he remembers it and refutes claims made by the doctor who performed the procedure, Joseph Bruner, that he pulled Samuel Armas\u2019 hand out of the uterus.\n\nAccording to a report by Fox News in 2009, the picture, which has come to be known as the \u201cHand of Hope,\u201d was \u201ccited during congressional debates on the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act\u201d in 2000 and has encouraged Samuel and his mother to champion a pro-life message.\n\nClancy, who identified as pro-choice prior to the surgery, has since joined the pro-life crusade to protect the right to life of unborn children and has taken his message to expectant families overseas.\n\n\u201cI shared my story at over 150 events in [three] countries from 2007 to 2012,\u201d wrote Clancy. \u201cIt was an incredible blessing taking the picture and being able to share my story with so many people over the years.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Photojournalist Michael Clancy, who identified as pro-choice prior to taking the \"Hand of Hope\" photo, has since joined the pro-life crusade.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Photojournalist Michael Clancy, who identified as pro-choice prior to taking the \"Hand of Hope\" photo, has since joined the pro-life crusade.", "title": "Iconic 'Hand of Hope' Photo Inspires Pro-Life Message", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/141121_HandOfHope-pic.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-01-02T17:18:22+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1EWi6Kf"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Photojournalist Michael Clancy, who identified as pro-choice prior to taking the \"Hand of Hope\" photo, has since joined the pro-life crusade.", "title": "Iconic 'Hand of Hope' Photo Inspires Pro-Life Message", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/141121_HandOfHope-pic.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "fetal surgery", "published_time": "2015-01-03T03:01:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-02T17:18:22+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Hand of Hope, spina bifida, congenital disorders, fetal surgery, prenatal operation, Michael Clancy, pro-life, samuel armas"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI shared my story at over 150 events in [three] countries from 2007 to 2012,\u201d wrote Clancy.\nSamuel held firm.\u201dFifteen years later, the iconic photograph Clancy captured during that moment continues to inspire hope across the globe.\nDuring the surgery, Clancy witnessed something remarkable.\n\u201cSuddenly, an entire arm thrust out of the opening [of the exposed uterus], then pulled back until just a little hand was showing,\u201d Clancy wrote on his personal blog.\nPhotojournalist Michael Clancy, who identified as pro-choice prior to taking the photo, has since joined the pro-life crusade."}
