The email also said the association was beginning an immediate search for Puentes\u2019 replacement.\n\nHASC Role in Changing CalOptima Directors\n\nLast year, a searing grand jury report titled CalOptima Burns While a Majority of Supervisors Fiddle said HASC lobbyists \u201chelped rewrite\u201d the 2011 ordinance initiated by Supervisor Janet Nguyen to completely remake the CalOptima board of directors giving medical providers control and hospitals a permanent seat.\n\nCalOptima is the county\u2019s health plan for residents who are poor, elderly or disabled and currently serves about 650,000 members, roughly half of them children. It\u2019s budget this year is about $3 billion, making it the largest county agency.\n\nNguyen\u2019s changes created a whole new board of directors with no health plan management experience just as health organizations nationwide were making major program adjustments and expanding dramatically to prepare for the beginning of ObamaCare. But CalOptima, which lost more than a dozen top executives during the turmoil, failed to gear up well, according to recent federal and state audits.\n\nFollowing her takeover of CalOptima, Nguyen, a Republican who won the central Orange County 34th state Senate district seat in this month's election, raised more than $100,000 from the medical industry, according to campaign reports. Before she joined the CalOptima board, she raised about $15,000 from medical providers.\n\nSupervisor Todd Spitzer, who was appointed to the CalOptima board by the supervisors this year, has publicly said the supervisors will review the make-up of the CalOptima board and determine what changes need to be made. He told a Sept. 4 meeting of the CalOptima board \u201cis this the ideal composition of this board? I don\u2019t know the answer.\u201d\n\nFollowing Nguyen\u2019s realignment of the CalOptima board of directors, Puentes helped with Nguyen\u2019s fundraising.\n\nIn its 2013 report, the grand jury referred to a $250-per-person fundraiser for Nguyen that was held in February 2012 at the home of Dan Brothman, the former CEO Western Medical Center in Santa Ana.\n\nA copy of the fundraiser invitation provided to Voice of OC stated RSVPs should be directed to a phone number that also is listed as the Orange County contact for the Hospital Association of Southern California, which represents 26 hospitals in the county.\n\nAt the time, Puentes said \"I told Dan Brothman that we would be happy to help him with that.\"\n\nNguyen blasted the 2013 Grand Jury for its report, claiming it was untrue that HASC lobbyists helped write the ordinance that remade the CalOptima board.\n\n\u201cThis is outright wrong,\u201d Nguyen told a news conference at the time. \u201cThe lobbyists did not help to write the amendment that changed the composition of the CalOptima board.\u201d\n\nBut her assertions were countered at the time by former CalOptima board Chairman Ed Kacic who said that shortly before the proposed ordinance went to the supervisors for a vote on Oct. 4, 2011, HASC lobbyists Puentes and her then-boss, Jim Lott, told him and CalOptima board Vice Chairman Jim McAleer \u201cin a face-to-face meeting\u201d that the \u201cdraft had considerable input from HASC.\u201d\n\nPlease contact Tracy Wood directly at twood@voiceofoc.org and follow her on Twitter: twitter.com/tracyVOC.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Julie Puentes was a key player in Supervisor Janet Nguyen's restructure of the CalOptima board, giving greater control to hospitals and medical industry.", "original-source": "http://voiceofoc.org/2014/11/controversial-oc-hospital-lobbyist-resigns/", "og": {"site_name": "Voice of OC", "description": "Julie Puentes was a key player in Supervisor Janet Nguyen's restructure of the CalOptima board, giving greater control to hospitals and medical industry.", "title": "Controversial OC Hospital Lobbyist Resigns", "url": "http://voiceofoc.org/2014/11/controversial-oc-hospital-lobbyist-resigns/", "image": "http://voiceofoc.org/files/2014/12/Voice-of-OC-logo-FB1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@VoiceofOC", "card": "summary"}, "syndication-source": "http://voiceofoc.org/2014/11/controversial-oc-hospital-lobbyist-resigns/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "county, top_news"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf205\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThis is outright wrong,\u201d Nguyen told a news conference at the time.\nJulie Puentes, the hospital lobbyist who played a pivotal role in changes to the CalOptima board of directors that contributed to its administrative turmoil, has resigned from her job with the Hospital Association of Southern California.\nHe told a Sept. 4 meeting of the CalOptima board \u201cis this the ideal composition of this board?\nI don\u2019t know the answer.\u201dFollowing Nguyen\u2019s realignment of the CalOptima board of directors, Puentes helped with Nguyen\u2019s fundraising.\nNguyen blasted the 2013 Grand Jury for its report, claiming it was untrue that HASC lobbyists helped write the ordinance that remade the CalOptima board."}
