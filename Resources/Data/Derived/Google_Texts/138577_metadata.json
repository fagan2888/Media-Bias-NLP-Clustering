Morris\u2019 proposition is simple: Obama\u2019s actions, which may be seen as dangerous in their individual pieces, are even more so when brought together.\n\nThe president is going beyond what previous presidents have done in exercising their executive powers. He is aiming at nothing less than the transformation of our democratic republic into a one-party state.\n\nLet that sink in for a minute.\n\nThe checks and balances that you learned about in civics class are being sidelined. The Executive Branch is taking on the powers delegated by the Constitution to the Legislative Branch.\n\nThe Judicial Branch, described by Alexander Hamilton in the Federalist Papers as the branch of the federal government least dangerous to liberty, is being packed with activist judges who will support Obama\u2019s every act.\n\nThe Legislative branch itself, with the Senate still in the hands of Democrat Sen. Harry Reid, goes along with the president\u2019s wishes and blocks literally hundreds of House bills. The Republican House impotently tries to sue in the federal courts.\n\nStalemate in the Congress suits the president\u2019s agenda.\n\nChoosing which laws to enforce\n\nBypassing Congress through executive order\n\nChanging immigration laws\n\nChallenging voter fraud laws\n\nIntimidating the opposition through regulatory agencies such as the IRS\n\nExpanding entitlement programs\n\nIgnoring Senate rules on appointments\n\nIntimidating the media\n\nRigging union elections\n\nEliminating the Electoral College\n\nIn the introduction, Morris brings together ten strands of policy that he says form the plan. In short, they are:\n\nThe book\u2019s introduction explains these points briefly then explains in detail the many examples of each before describing how the federal bureaucracy is being used to accomplish these goals in the areas of health care, energy, environment, education, communications and welfare.\n\nNo rule, precedent, tradition, or even fundamental precept of our democracy is to be allowed to stand in the path of their march toward one-party rule. \u2013 Dick Morris, Power Grab\n\nMorris says that the plan began after the 2010 election when the Democrats lost control of the House and with it, the ability to pass any law at will. At that point, Morris says, the president decided to do an end-run around Congress.\n\nMorris is really setting out a theory to explain the actions of the president in a coherent, comprehensive, unifying way. It\u2019s an inductive theory, guessing at a unifying goal behind all the disparate actions.\n\nThe test of any good theory is its explanatory power.\n\nWe believe in Newton\u2019s theory of gravity, for example, because in every observable instance it works. Likewise, the breath of Morris\u2019 evidence for the general theory of Obama\u2019s goal of single-party rule is persuasive.\n\nREAD ALSO: Andrew McCarthy: Faithless Execution\n\nTake, of example, the actions of the various federal departments. Congress appropriates the funds for all of them and it used to be that the department heads would go to Congress to justify their budgets and to answer to Congress for their actions.\n\nDepartment secretaries thus had divided loyalties: to the president as head of the Executive Branch and to the Congress as well.\n\nBut today those departments do not respond to Congress. Instead, they stonewall Congress. Their funding comes through \u201ccontinuing resolution,\u201d a tactic that avoids the deadlock set up by the Senate who refuse to pass any budget other than the one the president shaped in 2009. Any attempt at fiscal responsibility results in a \u201cshutdown\u201d of the federal government with all of the departments playing their role in making it as painful as possible for the American people.\n\nThose roles are orchestrated through the \u201cczars\u201d in the White House\u2014people mostly not confirmed by the Senate.\n\nMorris tends to use the terms one-party nation, one-party state and one-party rule interchangeably. What he means is a system in which the president rules by fiat, with no checks and balances.\n\nThere\u2019s no need for a Congress except for form\u2019s sake\u2014very much as was the case with the Roman Imperial Senate or the Congress of the Soviet Union. The judiciary exists only to enforce the rule of the president.\n\nElections have foregone conclusions.\n\nThe history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. \u2014 The Declaration of Independence\n\nThere would still be a token opposition in the Republican Party but that party would never be able to elect a president. There would still be a Congress, but it would be impotent. There would still be a Constitution, but it would mean whatever the president, supported by his courts, said it meant.\n\nPeople would still have rights\u2014but they would be rights granted by government, not natural rights protected by government.\n\nSuch is the plan for the fundamental transformation of the United States of America. Such is the meaning of \u201cHope \u2018n\u2019 Change.\u201d\n\nVoter apathy in the 2014 Mid-Terms, a stalemated Congress for the next two years, and another Democratic president in 2016 is the recipe for Morris\u2019 predictions to come true.\n\nRead Power Grab: Obama\u2019s Dangerous Plan for a One-Party Nation.
