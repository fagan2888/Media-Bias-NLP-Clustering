Over the past year, NASH is up nearly 18.2%, a performance that tops the S&P 500 by about 350 basis points.\n\nFor people who have money in the area, who know the local economy and like the local companies and know them better than they know other publicly-traded companies, NASH makes sense, but the ETF\u2019s performance is meriting of a wider audience.\n\nNASH \u201crealized a 12.8 percent net asset value return through Oct. 31, according to Lipper, a Thomson Reuters firm that provides fund ratings and commentary, as published in the Wall Street Journal. The fund also had the greatest one-year return, at 20.4 percent, out of more than 700 funds, according to a statement from fund\u2019s founding company, LocalShares,\u201d reports Jamie McGee for The Tennessean.\n\nNASH\u2019s underlying LocalShares Nashville Index utilizes an algorithm to identify and weight companies based on positive earnings, momentum and valuation metrics. [Nashville ETF Debuts]\n\nAs The Tennessean notes, ongoing bullishness by the health care sector has been a significant driver of NASH\u2019s performance. The ETF, which only includes companies with market values of at least $100 million and average daily volume of at least 50,000 shares, features 10 health care stocks among its nearly 25 holdings.\n\nNASH\u2019s health care roster includes Acadia Healtcare (NasdaqGS: ACHC), Brookdale Senior Living (NYSE: BKD), Community Health Systems (NYSE: CYH), HCA Holdings (NYSE: HCA) and Lifepoint Hospitals (NasdaqGS: LPNT).\n\nImportantly, many of the health care names found in NASH are services provider, a group that has benefited in a big way from the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare.\n\nObamacare \u201cis healthy for hospitals: currently, hospitals \u2018collect four cents on the dollar\u2019 on their costs from uninsured patients who go to an emergency room for care but don\u2019t have the ability to pay. Under the new law, once those folks are insured, the hospitals will \u2018collect closer to 100 cents on the dollar,\u2019 said Larry Robbins of Glenview Capital Management in an interview with USA Today late last year.\n\nNashville Area ETF", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "sector etfs,nashville etf,localshares,feature stories,featured,indexing,lead,nash", "google-site-verification": "Q-wAoS5rW2yMYxQN_OT0klqLjkfU6a6rxznKurdUlsY", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.etftrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/favicon-1.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8fa4\"", "article_summary": "[Nashville ETF Debuts]As The Tennessean notes, ongoing bullishness by the health care sector has been a significant driver of NASH\u2019s performance.\nNashville Area ETF\nNASH\u2019s health care roster includes Acadia Healtcare (NasdaqGS: ACHC), Brookdale Senior Living (NYSE: BKD), Community Health Systems (NYSE: CYH), HCA Holdings (NYSE: HCA) and Lifepoint Hospitals (NasdaqGS: LPNT).\nNASH\u2019s underlying LocalShares Nashville Index utilizes an algorithm to identify and weight companies based on positive earnings, momentum and valuation metrics.\nWhen the Nashville Area ETF (NYSEArca: NASH) debuted in August 2013, the fund did not lack for critics, many of which asserted the fund\u2019s narrow regional focus would not be a selling point with potential investors."}
