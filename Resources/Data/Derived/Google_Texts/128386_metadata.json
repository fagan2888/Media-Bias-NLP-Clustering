But the transcript of the Univision program is clear: Rubio did indeed say what Cruz quotes him as saying. Was Cruz perhaps quoting Rubio out of context, making the statement seem to imply more than it really did?\n\nQuite the reverse. Had Cruz cited the fuller context, Rubio would have looked much worse. He had actually told Univision that Obama\u2019s DACA [Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals] is important. He added \u201cAt some point it\u2019s going to have to end,\u201d but then spelled out when and why: \u201cit\u2019s going to end because immigration reform is going to pass.\u201d In other words, Obama\u2019s illegal executive action would stay in place into an indefinite future time when legislation enacts a legal version of it anyway.\n\nFar from lying about what Rubio had said, Cruz had greatly understated the point. Why then did Rubio respond as he did? Since what Cruz said was accurate, it would have been natural for Rubio to explain why he had said it, just as he had done for Univision. Instead, he launched into a series of accusations about Cruz\u2019s lies, though it was Rubio who was lying.\n\nThe answer surely lies in the fact that only one week earlier, Phyllis Schlafly\u2019s organization, The Eagle Forum, had issued a devastating report on Rubio\u2019s consistent record of deception concerning illegal immigration, stretching from his days in the Florida legislature right up to the present. It is an astonishing document, well researched and fully documented, and appears to leave no doubt that since running for the U.S. Senate Rubio has always loudly claimed to be moderate and reasonable on illegal immigration (border security and enforcement of employment laws must come first before anything else can happen, no access for illegals to welfare or Obamacare, no immediate legalization, no chain migration, no amnesty, etc.) while the actions he took always did the exact opposite. The weight of the evidence Schlafly cites is impressive.\n\nBut what is most relevant to where we are now is the light the report sheds on the way Rubio currently presents himself on this issue, post gang-of-eight. As if sadder and wiser after his mistake in supporting the gang\u2019s amnesty bill, Rubio now says that he has learned that before anything else can happen, there must be a fence, border enforcement, employment law enforcement, and so on. But what the Schlafly report demonstrates is that this is exactly the same PR that Rubio used to reassure conservatives and thereby get 68 Senate votes for the gang\u2019s bill: he always understood that he could only sell it by persuading skeptics that border security, etc., must come first, before anything else (legalization) could happen \u2014 though the bill said exactly the opposite. And this fatally undermines his sincerity when he now tries to persuade us that this is his new position, one gained only by the bitter experience of seeing the gang\u2019s bill fail.\n\nThe Schlafly report carefully chronicles the way in which Rubio deceived one interviewer after another about the content of the gang\u2019s bill: Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Bill O\u2019Reilly, Mark Levin and others. Over and over again, the interviewers asked Rubio for reassurance on the many questions that would be deal breakers for conservatives: whether illegals would get access to welfare, or to cash payments from the IRS (the negative income tax), or to Obamacare; whether it allowed chain migration; whether administrative discretion could override the bill\u2019s provisions; and most importantly of course whether legalization would happen only after clear proof that the border was secure and employment laws were being enforced.\n\nEvery time, Rubio reassured them that the bill was firm on all the points that conservatives were anxious about. But it wasn\u2019t \u2014 he was lying about every one of these points. However, when speaking to a Spanish audience (on Univision) Rubio told the truth: legalization and everything that automatically came with it would come first \u2014 the minute the bill was signed, in fact \u2014 and it was not conditional on anything. Schlafly summarizes: \u201cRubio traded shamelessly on the affection and trust conservatives had placed in him. His deceptions about his immigration bill rivaled and exceeded Obama\u2019s claims about disastrous Obamacare.\u201d\n\nInevitably, people began to read the bill and find out that what Rubio was saying was completely false. At first Rubio accused them of lying about his bill, but as more and more voices were raised he was forced to change his tack: now he feigned surprise at what was in the bill that he had written, and agreed that it needed fixing. But his presentation to Univision proved that he always knew perfectly well what was in the bill. Rubio now promised to fix the bill to bring it into line with the assurances he had been making about its content, and also promised not to vote for it unless it had been fixed. He broke both promises. Schlafly documents how Rubio first obstructed attempts to fix the bill, then voted for it.\n\nAfter reading the Schlafly report we in a better position to understand what made Rubio fly off the handle and accuse Cruz of serial lying when what he was saying was unquestionably factual. When Cruz touched on what Rubio has been saying to Univision \u2014 one of Schlafly\u2019s themes \u2014 he saw immediately how dangerous this could be to his credibility and so decided to pre-empt the credibility issue by accusing Cruz of lying before his own could be exposed.\n\nMarco Rubio on illegal immigration is a sorry record of perfidy and betrayal. Phyllis Schlafly suggests that such habitual lying should rule him out of consideration for the presidency. Until Rubio comes up with a convincing rebuttal of her report, that conclusion will be difficult to argue with.\n\nJohn M.
