They must be subject to our stern punishment,\" it added.\n\n\n\nEven the U.S. didn't escape North Korea's criticism as the latter expressed pity on the former for allegedly attempting to \"threaten\" the state's authority to little avail.\n\n\n\n\"How pitiful the U.S. is, desperately scrambling to tear down the authority of our republic that grows mightier by the day, with a shabby movie, now that no pressure or threat has worked.\"\n\n\n\nThis is reportedly not the first time that North Korea has expressed displeasure towards James Franco and Seth Rogen's film.
