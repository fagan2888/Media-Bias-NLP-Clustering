That bar is lowered to 5 percent or more of household income for low-income families. Having a deductible that exceeds 5 percent of income also qualifies one as being underinsured.\n\nRead More Obamacare could be squeezing spending\n\n\n\n\"Someone who is underinsured does have health insurance, but with coverage that does not protect against high health costs relative to income,\" Blumenthal said.\n\nThe report noted that the share of people who were underinsured because they had high-deductible health plans has more than tripled from 2003, when it was 2 million people, to 7 million people last year. Though there is sometimes a tendency for people to choose low-premium plans with high deductibles, \"that may not tend to be a wise choice in all cases,\" Blumenthal said.\n\nThe research, which was primarily based on a survey of more than 3,000 adults, found that there was no significant change in the total number of people who are underinsured since 2010. But the current underinsured rate, of 23 percent of adults ages 19 to 64, is still sharply higher than the 12 percent of such people who were underinsured in 2003, according to the report.\n\n\n\nRead MoreHow hard is it to buy health insurance?\n\nBlumenthal noted that while recent years have seen a marked slowdown in the increase in health-care costs, the rate of underinsurance could grow if those costs accelerate.", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "Rising deductibles have become a bigger contributing factor in cases of people having insurance but being financially strained.", "author": "Dan Mangan", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "Deductibles have become a bigger factor in cases of people having insurance but being financially strained.", "title": "High deductibles put big strain on 'underinsured'", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/05/20/high-deductibles-put-big-strain-on-underinsured.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2015/05/19/102692183-172601101.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Deductibles have become a bigger factor in cases of people having insurance but being financially strained.", "title": "High deductibles put big strain on 'underinsured'", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/05/20/high-deductibles-put-big-strain-on-underinsured.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2015/05/19/102692183-172601101.1910x1000.jpg"}, "creator": "@_DanMangan", "site": "@CNBC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "CNBC Business News and Finance", "app_store_id": 398018310}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398018310", "GOOGLEBOT": "unavailable_after: 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT", "keywords": "Health Care, Health Care, Obamacare, US: News, Politics, business news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnbc", "published_time": "2015-05-20T13:17:55-0400", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/dan.mangan.54", "section": "Health Care", "modified_time": "2015-05-20T14:06:36-0400", "tag": "Politics"}, "pageNodeId": 102692136, "news_keywords": "Health insurance, Obamacare, high deductible, Commonwealth, underinsured"}, "article_summary": "Read More Obamacare could be squeezing spending\"Someone who is underinsured does have health insurance, but with coverage that does not protect against high health costs relative to income,\" Blumenthal said.\nThe report, conducted every two years, defines being underinsured as having health coverage throughout the year but having out-of-pocket health costs that are 10 percent or more of household income.\nHaving a deductible that exceeds 5 percent of income also qualifies one as being underinsured.\nThough there is sometimes a tendency for people to choose low-premium plans with high deductibles, \"that may not tend to be a wise choice in all cases,\" Blumenthal said.\n\"If health insurance costs continue to be shifted to consumers at the rates we have seen over the past 10 years, the problem will likely grow.\""}
