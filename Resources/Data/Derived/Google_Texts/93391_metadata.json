And while it\u2019s being hailed as a win for those fighting against human trafficking, it\u2019s also a challenge for companies who have long supply chains and rely almost exclusively on foreign migrant workers to create their products.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nThough less common in the U.S., many labor brokers in Asian countries often charge already impoverished people for a two-year job on a consumer-electronics assembly line. The brokers charge high fees that are often equivalent to at least one year\u2019s wages, and hold the migrants\u2019 passports and papers hostage to ensure they pay their debt.\n\nIn an effort to lessen the human rights abuses around the world, many organizations and state laws have begun to encourage companies to ensure human trafficking is not occurring within their organization or that of their suppliers.\n\nAs part of Obama\u2019s executive order, the president gave corporations who supply the world\u2019s biggest consumer \u2014 the U.S. government \u2014 until Dec. 20 to give their input on the new regulations to ensure they could comply with the new rules.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear whether Apple has given any input to the Obama administration regarding the rules, as the company has declined to comment on how the new rules could impact its business. And while other technology companies have expressed their concerns about being held responsible for the actions of their suppliers, Apple seems to be completely lax about everything. But should they be?\n\nThough Apple is known for its technology products, the company is actually just the designer of the equipment \u2014 it doesn\u2019t actually build any products itself. To build Apple products the company hires other giant companies such as Foxconn and Flextronics International, which own and operate factories in places such as Kuala Lumpur and Malaysia.\n\nAlthough the factories are located halfway around the world, Apple\u2019s corporate responsibility webpage on labor and human rights issues says that \u201cIf companies want to do business with us, they must act fairly and ethically at all times.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t allow suppliers to act unethically or in ways that threaten the rights of workers \u2014 even when local laws and customs permit such practices,\u201d the company says. \u201cWe\u2019re working to end excessive work hours, prohibit unethical hiring policies, and prevent the hiring of underage workers.\u201d\n\nThe technology giant says it strictly prohibits bonded labor in its Supplier Code of Conduct, and suppliers who violate this policy \u201cmust reimburse excessive recruitment fees \u2014 anything higher than the equivalent of one month\u2019s net wages \u2014 for any eligible contract worker found working on Apple projects.\u201d\n\nAlthough Apple says that since 2008 its suppliers have refunded more than $13 million to workers, and nearly half of those payments came in 2012 alone, a report in Businessweek says that audits the company did of its suppliers last year found that suppliers overcharged these enslaved employees by $6.4 million.\n\nThe report also pointed out that an employee has to inform Apple that they were charged more than a month\u2019s wages for the job, but since brokers have become aware of this, they now threaten workers in the hopes they don\u2019t talk to anyone at Apple.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The initiative states that if a company wants to keep the government as a customer, that organization cannot sell jobs to vulnerable populations or knowingly engage in any other human rights abuses.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Katie Rucke", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "The initiative states that if a company wants to keep the government as a customer, that organization cannot sell jobs to vulnerable populations or knowingly engage in any other human rights abuses.", "title": "Obama\u2019s Anti-Human Trafficking Policy May Prove To Be Tough Hurdle For Tech Companies", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/obamas-anti-human-trafficking-policy-may-prove-tough-hurdle-tech-companies/175575/", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/122013_Foxconn_16x9-690x431.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-12-26T11:16:54-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The initiative states that if a company wants to keep the government as a customer, that organization cannot sell jobs to vulnerable populations or knowingly engage in any other human rights abuses.", "creator": "@katierucke", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/122013_Foxconn_4x3.jpg", "title": "Obama\u2019s Anti-Human Trafficking Policy May Prove To Be Tough Hurdle For Tech Companies", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Front Page: National", "tag": "Strengthening Protections Against Trafficking in Persons in Federal Contracts", "published_time": "2013-12-26T05:00:28-05:00", "modified_time": "2013-12-26T11:16:54-05:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbf2c\"", "article_summary": "Obama\u2019s Anti-Human Trafficking Policy May Prove To Be Tough Hurdle For Tech CompaniesThe initiative states that government contractors cannot sell jobs to vulnerable populations or knowingly engage in any other human rights abuses.\nAnd while other technology companies have expressed their concerns about being held responsible for the actions of their suppliers, Apple seems to be completely lax about everything.\nIn an effort to lessen the human rights abuses around the world, many organizations and state laws have begun to encourage companies to ensure human trafficking is not occurring within their organization or that of their suppliers.\nThe order was designed to protect the estimated more than 20 million men, women and children who are trafficked around the world.\nAnd while it\u2019s being hailed as a win for those fighting against human trafficking, it\u2019s also a challenge for companies who have long supply chains and rely almost exclusively on foreign migrant workers to create their products."}
