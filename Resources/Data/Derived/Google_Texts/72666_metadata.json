Henley)\n\nThe dreadful Necessary and Proper Clause was contentiously protested by the Anti-Federalists when it was first proposed by Alexander Hamilton in 1787. Its inclusion in our Constitution became a focal point of criticism for the states that opposed ratification.\n\nPatrick Henry, Tom Paine, George Mason and other prominent Anti-Federalists angrily protested claiming it would destroy states rights and independence. Federalists James Madison and Alexander Hamilton argued in defiance. They defended its necessity claiming without it our Constitution would be \u201ca meaningless piece of crumpled parchment paper!\u201d\n\nPatrick Henry, a great orator, delivered an impassioned speech that denounced the Necessary and Proper Clause. He claimed it would inevitably destroy individual liberty.\n\n\u201cI know not what others may choose but, as for me, give me liberty or give me death.\u201d ~Patrick Henry\n\nAfter the Constitution was ratified, the interpretation of the Necessary and Proper Clause was questioned constantly by both the Democratic-Republican and Federalist parties. Every time the Federalists steeped out of line they used this infamous clause as absolution for \u201cstretching\u201d their authority.\n\nThis was done so often it became known as the \u201cElastic Clause\u201d. Until 1791 it was tolerated but when the government decided to get into the banking business those from both sides of the aisle called\u201cfoul\u201d! Thomas Jefferson vociferated the loudest and scolded them harshly: \u201cI believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies.\u201d\n\nHamilton\u2019s plan to charter the first federal bank and have the government assume the war debts of the states made the South very apprehensive. James Madison along with Jefferson and others opposed the creation of this bank believing it would lead to increased federal authority over the states. They claimed there was no necessity or benefit for the government to get into the business of printing money.\n\nIn other words, it was not \u201cnecessary and proper.\u201d Madison, a Federalist, who wrote the \u201cFederalist Papers\u201d under the pen name of \u201cPublius\u201d, sided with the Anti-Federalists in this dog fight, condemning this abuse of power. To embarrass Madison, Hamilton read excerpts from his claims in the Federalist Papers when he boldly defended a strong federal government: \u201cWherever a general power to do a thing is given, every particular power for doing it is included.\u201d\n\nWhen this historic bill was passed and signed by President Washington, many constitutional historians claim this was the beginning of the end of limited federal government. The legislative and executive branches had ventured into un-chartered waters blatantly violating the enumerated powers granted to them in the Constitution. With a stroke of a quill they set the stage for the continued reduction of the \u201cunenumerated\u201d rights of the states.\n\nThe Constitution which was once the main guardian against abusive federal bureaucracy and the protector of the individual rights of our citizens and states had been severely injured. And Madison was on the right side of history when he argued \u201cIt was unconstitutional to create the bank of the United States because doing so was \u201ca great and important power\u201d not expressly enumerated and therefore could not be implied.\u201d\n\nThroughout the years the Judicial Branch, whose obligation is to hold the government in check and protect the rights of the states, has broadly misinterpreted the provisions granted to Congress in the Necessary and Proper Clause. Some Judges have declared that it limits Congress to being a \u201cservant\u201d while others claim that it entitles them to be \u201cmasters.\u201d\n\nThese judicial opinions about the clause become more tautologous and redundant with each court decision depending who is on the bench. The Supreme Court has exercised too much leniency by permitting unconstitutional laws and decisions by the other branches to stand, out of respect for this clause.\n\n\u201cSociety is well governed when its people obey the magistrates, and the magistrates obey the law.\u201d ~Solon\n\nJustice John Roberts rocked the world with his recent precipitous back-flip to uphold Obamacare. By \u201cstretching the elastic\u201d of this elusive doctrine claiming it was necessary and proper to \u201ctax\u201d our citizens as a form of punishment not following an unconstitutional law, he set a new precedent!\n\nOnly a handful of Americans were happy with this decision. But \u201cThis was some good news today for embattled Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius. Obamacare will cover all her injuries after the White House throws her under the bus. She is totally covered.\u201d (Jay Leno)\n\nFor decades Congress has taken a few more of our rights and privileges each session in the name of doing things that are necessary and proper. This makes one wonder who is the benefactor of this necessary and proper legislation? Is it necessary and proper for their special interest groups and the political groupies who financed their campaigns?\n\nJudging by these continual, intolerable assaults against our rights and privileges, it is not being done to secure the \u201cBlessings of Liberty\u201d guaranteed to us citizens by the Constitution. According to Hamilton it was only meant to protect us from ourselves in the event we proved incapable of managing our own governments, and nothing more. Yet eventually even George Washington changed his tune shortly after he had been elected: \u201cArbitrary power is most easily established on the ruins of liberty abused to licentiousness.\u201d\n\nJames Madison warned us that \u201cThe essence of Government is power; and power, lodged as it must be in human hands, will ever be liable to abuse.\u201d Our Constitution clearly states that all laws enacted by Congress must be necessary to secure liberty, aimed at goals consistent with the enumerated powers, preserving federalism and the separation of powers and to protect the natural rights of our citizens. They have been violating these principles powers for decades.\n\nThe legislative and executive branches of the federal government need to be held strictly accountable to the provisions of the Constitution. But until we demand the judicial branch to strictly enforce the provisions of the Constitution instead of manipulating them with misguided political interpretation, we will continue to see the abusive growth and domination of federalism. \u201cJudicial abuse occurs when judges substitute their own political views for the law.\u201d (Lamar S. Smith)\n\nGeorge Washington told us \u201cLiberty, when it begins to take root, is a plant of rapid growth.\u201d And each day that our states rights are violated, we lose another liberty. John Adams warned us that \u201cLiberty, once lost, is lost forever.\u201d There is nothing \u201cNecessary and Proper\u201d about the loss of our rights and liberty!\n\n\u201cLiberty is always dangerous, but it is the safest thing we have.\u201d ~H.
