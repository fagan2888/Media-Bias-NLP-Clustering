Senator Marco Rubio broke his silence about allegations one of his aides punched a Rand Paul aide in the face.

The alleged incident has been posted to YouTube. It was taken inside a bar in Michigan.

After speaking before a crowd inside a conference room at a Marriott hotel in Atlanta, Rubio said his aide, Rich Beeson, was still working for his campaign.

"As I've learned in life, there's two sides to every story. We'll allow local authorities to figure [that out]. But Mr. Beeson's doing a good job for us," said Rubio.

The Republican presidential candidate spoke to a crowd about his support for term limits, his tax plan, which he said will re-invigorate the economy, and his idea to replace and repeal Obamacare.

From there, Rubio spoke at the St. Regis hotel in the Buckhead section of Atlanta during a fundraiser for his campaign. That event was closed to the media.
