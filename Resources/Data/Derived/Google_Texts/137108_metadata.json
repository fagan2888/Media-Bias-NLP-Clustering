Natural alternatives to sugar sweeteners exist, but even they have pitfalls if consumed in excess.\n\nWe are hard-wired to love sweets. It starts with the tongue: At the first bite of a dessert, our taste buds send a jolt of the splendid news to the brain, which responds by releasing a pleasure-causing neurotransmitter called dopamine, a cozy chemical reward for scoring what our brain senses as high-caloric food. A boon of extra calories can benefit people who occasionally encounter sweet foods. For example, when our paleolithic ancestors happened upon ripe autumn fruits, ingestion of the simple sugar fructose stimulated their appetites, encouraging them to eat more and more. This was a boon for both vegetation and people: Gorging on grapes would lead to greater seed dispersal for the plants, and the eaters\u2019 seasonal flood of fructose into human bodies was converted by their livers into fat, stored energy that would help them survive the winter. But take that metabolism and plug it into a modern, relatively sedentary culture with constant access to heavily advertised sweeteners, and all sorts of troubles emerge: tooth decay, diabetes, obesity, gout, fatty liver disease and damage to the kidneys and the circulatory system.\n\nClever chemists have attempted to circumvent those problems by formulating artificial sweeteners, which promise pleasure without peril. More than 15 percent of Americans consume artificial sweeteners in thousands of products, according to the Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine.\n\nBut the use of artificial sweeteners seems to coincide with a climb in obesity rates, notes Susan Swithers, a behavioral neuroscientist at Purdue University in Indiana, who studies how experience with foods affects food intake.\n\nArtificial sweeteners might \u201cbreak a basic type of learned relationship between sweet tastes and the arrival of calories and sugars in the digestive system,\u201d Swithers says. \u201cPeople who routinely use artificial sweeteners show responses that are dramatically different from those who do not.\u201d\n\nFLIPPING A SWITCH\n\nPeople who ingest simple table sugar get a boost of glucose in their blood, which flips a switch of satiety that curbs the appetite. The brain learns this, and the satiety signals start to show up even before the sugar is absorbed.\n\nNoncaloric sweeteners, however, appear to mislead us into what scientists term a \u201cmetabolic derangement,\u201d which prevents satiety signals from developing.\n\n\u201cMore food has to be eaten to feel as satisfied,\u201d Swithers says, \u201ceven when real sugar is eaten.\u201d\n\nWhen our unconscious calorie switch becomes confused by noncaloric sweeteners, we must rely on conscious effort, such as reading food labels, to curb our intake.\n\n\u201cBut we know people have a difficult time with that,\u201d Swithers says. \u201cNoncaloric sweeteners can also produce cognitive distortions, like making people overeat because they think what they\u2019re doing is healthy.\u201d\n\nIndeed, several large-scale studies correlate the use of artificial sweeteners with weight gain. A University of Texas study found that people who consumed two or more diet sodas per day over a period of almost 10 years had waist circumference increases five times greater than those who followed a different beverage path \u2014 a group that included people who drank sugar-sweetened sodas, although regular soda use was relatively infrequent.\n\nBut James O. Hill, director of the University of Colorado\u2019s Anschutz Health and Wellness Center, takes issue with the methodology of that study.\n\n\u201cThe links sometimes found between low-calorie sweeteners (LCS) and obesity in epidemiology may be explained by the fact that it is those with obesity who are more likely to choose LCS,\u201d Hill wrote in an e-mail: \u201cEpidemiological studies cannot determine cause and effect.\u201d\n\nWith funding from the American Beverage Association, a trade group for makers of soft drinks, Hill spearheaded a study of 308 overweight and obese diet-drink consumers who were placed in a behavioral weight-loss program.\n\nHalf of those were told to change their behavior and switch to water. Those who drank diet beverages lost an average of 13 pounds in 12 weeks, compared with the nine pounds lost by those who drank only water.\n\n\u201cLCSs seem to be doing exactly what they were designed to do,\u201d Hill wrote in an editorial in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition: \u201chelping reduce total energy intake while providing the sweet taste we value.\u201d\n\nSwithers is highly critical of Hill\u2019s study. One of several issues that she has with the research: Hill\u2019s water-drinking group was allowed to continue using artificial sweeteners in foods.\n\n\u201cThat study is unfortunately so fundamentally flawed that it\u2019s impossible to draw any conclusions from it other than that people can lose weight over the course of three months, which we already know,\u201d she said.\n\nGOING NATURAL\n\nOn another front of uneasiness with artificial sweeteners, a recent study published in the journal Nature found that three synthetic sweeteners \u2014 saccharin (Sweet\u2019n Low), sucralose (Splenda) and aspartame (Equal) \u2014 upset the balance of intestinal flora, causing glucose intolerance in mice and in some humans tested.\n\n\u201cStudies in rodents cannot necessarily be extrapolated to humans,\u201d Hill says. \u201cAlso, virtually everything affects the intestinal flora.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, some people attempt to sidestep potential problems with artificial sweeteners by turning to natural alternatives, but even those can cause trouble. For example, sugar alcohols, which are sweet, low-calorie chemicals naturally found in fruits, can produce bloating or laxative effects if used in large doses.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t really matter whether things are \u2018natural\u2019 or fully synthesized in the lab,\u201d Swithers says, \u201cthey will be problematic. Foods and beverages that are sweetened, regardless of the type of sweetener, should be thought of as occasional treats, not as things that are consumed on a daily basis, much less at every meal.\u201d\n\nHill maintains our ingrained fondness for sugar is stronger than our will power.\n\n\u201cI believe it is unreasonable to think we can wean ourselves away from sweets,\u201d says Hill, who, according to a disclaimer published with his paper, has received consulting fees from Coca-Cola.\n\n\u201cI believe that those recommending against use of these products are basing their recommendations on emotion more than science.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2015/03/sweets-001.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "article_summary": "Natural alternatives to sugar sweeteners exist, but even they have pitfalls if consumed in excess.\nClever chemists have attempted to circumvent those problems by formulating artificial sweeteners, which promise pleasure without peril.\nMore than 15 percent of Americans consume artificial sweeteners in thousands of products, according to the Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine.\nOne of several issues that she has with the research: Hill\u2019s water-drinking group was allowed to continue using artificial sweeteners in foods.\nSome people turn to artificial sweeteners, but those are under increasing suspicion of creating such metabolic problems as diabetes and obesity."}
