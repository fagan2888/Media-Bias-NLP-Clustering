Last year, customers had to create an account before seeing the details of insurance plans, which led to major bottlenecks \u2014 a problem that also affected the federal exchange and several other state exchanges.\n\nOther exchanges have also tried to streamline the enrollment process and the look of their websites. Many will have more workers in their call centers this year and more enrollment events to help people through the sign-up process. California\u2019s exchange, Covered California, is opening 200 storefronts across the state where people can get one-on-one help.\n\nNevada and Oregon, which had two of the worst-performing exchanges last year, are using the federal marketplace this time. Idaho is opening its own exchange after using the federal site, HealthCare.gov, last year. In all, 37 states will rely on the federal exchange for the coming enrollment period, and 13, as well as the District of Columbia, will run their own. Of the eight million people who enrolled in private health plans under the Affordable Care Act during the first sign-up period, 2.6 million used state-run exchanges.\n\nManagers of Vermont\u2019s troubled exchange, which has been offline for repairs since September, are asking customers who have coverage to avoid using the website during open enrollment to keep volume down. Asked last week whether the exchange would be working by Saturday, Gov. Peter Shumlin said, \u201cI\u2019ve been discouraged so many times by this website that I\u2019ll believe it when I see it.\u201d\n\nMinnesota is also still fixing defects in its exchange website, officials there said. Its exchange, MNsure, has increased the number of call center representatives to nearly 300, from about 25 when it opened last fall.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn Massachusetts, more than 300,000 residents who were temporarily enrolled in Medicaid when the state exchange faltered last year will have to reapply through the new system if they want to stay covered, as will as many as 140,000 people with private exchange plans.\n\nThe exchange will have 680 customer service representatives and application processors \u2014 more than twice as many as last year \u2014 and will be able to handle 3,500 concurrent website users on an average day, said Kimberly Haberlin, a spokeswoman for the Massachusetts exchange. \u201cWe are on the cusp of standing up a product that we are confident is going to work,\u201d she said.\n\nMs. Haberlin said the state did not have an estimate of how many new customers would sign up in the second enrollment period. But she pointed out that only about 3 percent of Massachusetts residents remain uninsured because a 2006 state law \u2014 the model for the Affordable Care Act \u2014 had already motivated most to get coverage.\n\nMany state-run exchanges say they now have carefully prepared backup plans if the websites fail, including paper applications. Maryland, in an abundance of caution, is rolling out its new system gradually instead of opening it to everyone Saturday. The exchange will hold a single enrollment fair that day where people can sign up with the help of trained counselors, but they will not be able to do so at home. On Sunday, people can start signing up by phone, and next Wednesday by themselves online.\n\nDr. Sharfstein said that because all the testing of the system was not \u201cthe same as actual use,\u201d exchange officials thought it best to increase access to it in a gradual, controlled fashion.\n\nBut Dr. Beilenson said he worried that the phased rollout would frustrate or confuse people. \u201cPeople might give up again if they go online and try four times in the first four days and can\u2019t enroll,\u201d he said.\n\nMaryland, like Massachusetts, has not said how many new customers it hopes to sign up for private coverage during the new enrollment period, which ends on Feb. 15. More than 80,000 people managed to sign up during the first enrollment period, but many filled out paper applications or received help from brokers or counselors who knew workarounds. About 65,000 remain enrolled, Dr. Sharfstein said.\n\nTo try to prevent frustration, the Maryland exchange will have 350 call center representatives this year \u2014 far more than it started with last time \u2014 and several thousand private insurance brokers trained to help people enroll. The new software allows brokers to see the online applications of people who have given them permission to do so, Dr. Sharfstein said, and complete their applications.\n\nConsumer groups that help enroll people will also be expanding their outreach. HealthCare Access Maryland, a nonprofit consumer group, is opening two new offices in strip malls, with weekend and evening hours, Kathleen Westcoat, the group\u2019s chief executive, said. The group\u2019s enrollment counselors have received \u201ca fair amount of training\u201d on the new system, she said, a major difference from last year.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt does really seem very user-friendly and clear,\u201d Ms. Westcoat said of the system. \u201cYou don\u2019t know until you know, but I feel good.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone":
