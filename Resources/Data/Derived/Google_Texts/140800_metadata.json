An English-speaking novitiate, quarters for religious novices, had been started in Maple Mount in 1895.\n\nPast pope\n\nOn May 14, 1981, the Louisville Times ran a front page photo by Keith Williams of Louisville Ursuline Sister Hermina Miltonberger praying after joining other nuns in a service for then-Pope John Paul II that morning at the Ursuline Motherhouse chapel on Lexington Road in Crescent Hill.\n\nThe pope had been shot during an assassination attempt two days before at St. Peter's Square in Vatican City, and the sisters were giving thanks that he had survived, The Times said.\n\nSister Angelice Seibert\n\nOn Dec. 4, 1957, The Times featured a story about Louisville Ursuline Sister and Ph.D.: Angelice Seibert, a biochemistry, physiology and anatomy teacher and also a researcher and chairwoman of the division of natural sciences at Ursuline College on Lexington, now the site of Sacred Heart Schools.\n\nSeibert, 35, had been awarded a $1,000 grant by the Damon Runyon Cancer Fund to carry on original research she began in 1950.\n\nIn her spare time, she also was said to be an enthusiastic tennis player and was pictured playing flute with three others musical sisters \u2014 a pianist, singer and guitarist.\n\nSister Visitor Center\n\nThe Mount Saint Joseph Ursuline sisters have continued to serve in Louisville, as well as other places in Kentucky, in Illinois and other states and in Chile.\n\nHeckel said the community has taken over operation of the Sister Visitor Center, 2235 W. Market St. in Portland in Louisville, a ministry of Catholic Charities that helps the poor.\n\nA 2012 C-J photo by Sam Upshaw showed Mount St. Joseph Sister Larraine Lauter at the center, greeting visiting Catholics on a bus tour.
