Study: Joe Biden goes from zero to absolutely silly in 3.7 seconds or less

It’s an unscientific one, performed by the Jimmy Fallon Institute for Late-Night Gold (or J-FLING, if you’re into the whole think tank-government complex of acronyms and pronouncing Brett Favre as Brett “Farve”), but we’ve gotta take it at its word, right?

“We’ve done this before on our show: When Obama gives a speech and Biden is there, we like to see exactly how long it takes for Biden to do something weird, and try to steal the spotlight,” Fallon said Wednesday night. “Last time was 3.7 seconds. He gave something like a finger gun. He just does these things.”

You mean like tooting a train whistle standing next to Seth Meyers just because that’s what vice-presidents do?

Fallon and his crack group of researchers tested the latest model of Biden to see if he could outdo the previous version. The test included President Obama speaking at a signing ceremony this week, and was controlled for variables such as Corvettes and women voters.

The results of the J-FLING experiment, as they say, “may shock you.” Take a look.

That’s right: 1.2 seconds to go from normalcy to an overly intense half-bow, or as Fallon’s announcer Steve Higgins called it, a “What Is That?”

Never gonna give you up, VEEP. Never gonna let us down.

(It doesn’t count as Rickrolling if you know if it’s coming and the joke is a decade old.)
