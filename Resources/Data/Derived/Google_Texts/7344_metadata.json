The uninsured rate is now at a historic low in the West Coast states.\n\nIdaho has missed out on that trend, largely because the state until now has refused to expand Medicaid eligibility on the federal dime. Idaho's Republican-controlled legislature was teetering Friday on whether to end its holdout.\n\n\n\n\u2018Over 1,000 deaths in this state\u2019\n\nState legislators get accused of a lot of things. But it's very rare for them to be accused to their faces of killing their fellow citizens.\n\nLast month, Dr. Kenneth Krell, director of critical care at Eastern Idaho Regional Medical Center in Idaho Falls, addressed an Idaho Senate committee.\n\n\u201cNearly one patient per day dies in this state as a result of not having Medicaid expansion,\u201d Krell stated. \u201cThat\u2019s a direct result of that failure to obtain care at a stage when the disease process could be treated effectively.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Idaho Legislature is unfortunately responsible for those deaths,\u201d Krell continued. \u201cOur intransigence in failing to pass Medicaid for the last three years has probably resulted in over 1,000 deaths in this state. And I see those patients on a nearly daily basis.\u201d\n\nSome lawmakers did not appreciate being told they \u201chave blood on their hands,\u201d though Krell and others making the point did not back down through the session\u2019s end.\n\n\u201cLet me put it this way. My father always said you draw more flies with honey than vinegar,\u201d Republican Idaho House Majority Leader Mike Moyle said. \u201cSometimes when you come in and make those accusations, it doesn\u2019t help your cause.\u201d\n\n\u201cHaving said that, we all know that there is an issue that needs to be addressed,\u201d Moyle added. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to work toward a solution.\u201d\n\nMinding the \u2018gap population\u2019\n\nThe focus of lawmakers and protesters are the working poor who earn too much to qualify for government-paid health coverage, but don\u2019t make enough to buy discounted insurance in the marketplace. The size of this so-called \u201cgap\u201d population in Idaho is estimated around 78,000.\n\nAs the hours of the 2016 session ticked down, the Idaho Legislature softened its past resistance to expanding Medicaid to cover this gap population. The federal government would pay for nearly all the cost under a major provision of Obamacare.\n\nThe state Senate voted 27-8 Thursday to ask the federal government for a waiver that would allow Idaho to redesign its Medicaid program to improve efficiency in advance of expansion. And then the Senate moved to adjourn for the year and left the state House with a take-it-or-leave it decision Friday.\n\nIf the House concurs, the 2017 Legislature would still get to review the refashioned health care program before it enrolled people from the uninsured population.\n\n\u201cIn my campaign I promised that I would do what I could to repeal Obamacare,\u201d state Rep. Ron Nate, R-Rexburg, said during an initial round of debate on Wednesday. \u201cThis is the opposite of repealing Obamacare. This is getting us right up to the final step of Idaho fully adopting every single part of Obamacare.\u201d\n\nThe Idaho Freedom Foundation urged Idahoans to tell their legislators to \u201creject more Obamacare in Idaho.\u201d Fred Birnbaum, vice president at the conservative public policy shop in Boise, worries the state could eventually be saddled with an unaffordable entitlement.\n\n\u201cThe question in my view is, do you expand a program that is potentially not sustainable and add a population that is not as vulnerable as the base population,\u201d Birnbaum said. \u201cIt could actually threaten the traditional Medicaid population given that the federal government is $19 trillion in debt.\u201d\n\nBirnbaum said IFF supports measures to deregulate the insurance market to permit lower cost coverage options and individual savings accounts in which able-bodied poor adults could put in money matched by non-profits and the state to buy private insurance.\n\nBig declines in uninsured Northwesterners\n\nOregon and Washington state expanded Medicaid in 2014. Medicaid eligibility was raised in the neighboring states up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level. According to the Washington State Health Care Authority, 589,000 people have gained Medicaid coverage under that change cumulatively.\n\n\"We blew past any of our estimates very quickly,\u201d HCA spokeswoman Amy Blondin said. \u201cThere was a lot of need out there.\"\n\nIn 2013, the percentage of the population that did not have health insurance stood in the mid- to high teens in all of the Northwest states. By late last year, that number had been cut by more than half in Washington and Oregon.\n\n\u201cWe saw a decline in the state of Washington from 14.2 percent uninsured to 7.3 percent. It has been dramatic in the reduction of the people who are uninsured,\u201d Washington state\u2019s Democratic Insurance Commissioner Mike Kreidler said. \u201cBy far, the number one reason for that to take place was the expansion of the Medicaid program.\u201d\n\nIdaho experienced a rather small drop by comparison by only agreeing to the online health coverage marketplace part of Obamacare with the federal subsidies.\n\nIdaho Governor Butch Otter said he wants a solution for people who fall through the gaps on health coverage. But he said Wednesday he would not act unilaterally to expand Medicaid eligibility using executive authority as the governors of some other \u2018red\u2019 states have done \u2013 including Alaska, Iowa and Nevada.\n\n\u2018Do you have health insurance?\u2019\n\nAccording to the Gallup polling organization, 15.2 percent of Idahoans did not have health insurance at the end of 2015. That compares to 19.9 percent in 2013. The comparable numbers for Oregon are 7.3 percent in 2015, down from 19.4 percent in 2013 and in Washington 7.4 percent, down from 16.8 percent in 2013. Gallup counted respondents who answered no when asked, \u201cDo you have health insurance?\u201d\n\nThe latest estimate of the uninsured rate from the Oregon\u2019s Health Authority based on different data sources -- including actual insurance program enrollments -- is 5.6 percent. Washington\u2019s Office of the Insurance Commissioner used the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s American Community Survey to arrive at an uninsured rate of 7.3 percent at the end of 2015, which is within the margin of error of Gallup\u2019s number.\n\nGallup\u2019s survey analysis identified multiple factors driving down uninsured rates. Foremost was the option to expand Medicaid eligibility. In addition, the Affordable Care Act -- better known as Obamacare -- spurred the creation of state and federal health insurance marketplace exchanges. The ACA also allowed young adults to stay on their parents\u2019 insurance policy until the age of 26.\n\nThe improving economy could be another factor in play as formerly unemployed people take jobs that offer health benefits.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "News", "description": "Listen \n        Listening...", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://kuow.org/post/idaho-house-lawmakers-face-crucial-vote-expanded-health-care-coverage", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/shared/npr/styles/medium/nprshared/201603/471858647.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Listen \n        Listening...", "title": "Idaho House Lawmakers Face Crucial Vote On Expanded Health Care Coverage"}, "story_id": 471849859, "twitter": {"site": "@kuow", "card": "summary", "creator": "@kuow"}, "author": "Tom Banse", "org_id": 1146, "dc": {"title": "Idaho House Lawmakers Face Crucial Vote On Expanded Health Care Coverage"}, "nid": 75577, "datePublished": "2016-03-27", "keywords": "Idaho, health, insurance, health care", "wordCount": 1222, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "According to the Washington State Health Care Authority, 589,000 people have gained Medicaid coverage under that change cumulatively.\nIn addition, the Affordable Care Act -- better known as Obamacare -- spurred the creation of state and federal health insurance marketplace exchanges.\n\u2018Do you have health insurance?\u2019According to the Gallup polling organization, 15.2 percent of Idahoans did not have health insurance at the end of 2015.\nLast month, Dr. Kenneth Krell, director of critical care at Eastern Idaho Regional Medical Center in Idaho Falls, addressed an Idaho Senate committee.\nIf the House concurs, the 2017 Legislature would still get to review the refashioned health care program before it enrolled people from the uninsured population."}
