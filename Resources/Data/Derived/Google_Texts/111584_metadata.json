But when it comes to the political money chase, the Northern California home of the world\u2019s technology giants spreads the wealth to both parties \u2014 positioning the tech industry as one of the most powerful forces in American politics.\n\nSince 2008, the Internet firms, software companies, computer manufacturers and data processors that comprise Silicon Valley have delivered more than $172 million worth of campaign contributions in federal elections, according to data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics. That\u2019s a nearly 40 percent increase over the prior 8 years. Counting only presidential election years, the increase is even more dramatic: The $109 million of Silicon Valley money pumped into the 2008 and 2012 elections represents a 61 percent increase from 2004 and 2000.\n\nOut of the money given directly to candidates (as opposed to third party groups) since 2008, Democrats have received 62 percent of the contributions. But Republicans\u2019 37 percent in that same time was hardly pocket change \u2014 it translated into a whopping $55 million.\n\nIn a vacuum, these figures may seem unimportant. But in context, they are astounding. All of a sudden, Silicon Valley has surpassed many traditional political powerhouses as a source of campaign cash. Specifically, in the last election cycle, technology firms delivered more money to candidates for president and Congress than defense contractors, pharmaceutical manufacturers, the automotive industry and Hollywood.\n\n\u201cSilicon Valley woke up to the importance of influencing public policy,\u201d said Stanford University\u2019s Vivek Wadhwa.\n\nIn 2012, that influence was on display when Internet firms notched an unexpected victory over the Hollywood studios that were pushing legislation to hold Internet companies responsible for the illegal transmission of pirated movies and television shows. Despite the so-called Stop Online Piracy Act being backed by the powerful Motion Picture Association of America, the bill was defeated by tech firms\u2019 furious lobbying campaign against the measure.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Mark Zuckerbergs and Elon Musks are ready to become America's next great political power brokers", "title": "\u201cA whole new generation of public policy\u201d: How Silicon Valley is invading our democracy", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The Mark Zuckerbergs and Elon Musks are ready to become America's next great political power brokers", "title": "\u201cA whole new generation of public policy\u201d: How Silicon Valley is invading our democracy", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/07/19/a_whole_new_generation_of_public_policy_how_silicon_valley_is_invading_our_democracy_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/01/mark_zuckerberg6.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Mark Zuckerbergs and Elon Musks are ready to become America's next great political power brokers", "title": "\u201cA whole new generation of public policy\u201d: How Silicon Valley is invading our democracy", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/01/mark_zuckerberg6.jpg", "creator": "@@davidsirota", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "David Sirota", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, David Sirota, Facebook, Google, Jeb Bush, Politics, Silicon Valley", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe14bc\"", "article_summary": "\u201cSilicon Valley woke up to the importance of influencing public policy,\u201d said Stanford University\u2019s Vivek Wadhwa.\nTopics: David Sirota, Facebook, Google, Jeb Bush, Politics, Silicon Valley, Technology News, Politics NewsWhen Jeb Bush visited Silicon Valley this week, the Republican candidate was visiting the heart of a Democratic state that few expect to be contested in the 2016 presidential election.\nAll of a sudden, Silicon Valley has surpassed many traditional political powerhouses as a source of campaign cash.\nCounting only presidential election years, the increase is even more dramatic: The $109 million of Silicon Valley money pumped into the 2008 and 2012 elections represents a 61 percent increase from 2004 and 2000.\nSpecifically, in the last election cycle, technology firms delivered more money to candidates for president and Congress than defense contractors, pharmaceutical manufacturers, the automotive industry and Hollywood."}
