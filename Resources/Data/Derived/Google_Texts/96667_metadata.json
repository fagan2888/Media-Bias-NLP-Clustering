A new Gallup poll shows that 63 percent of Americans disapprove of his response to the ongoing revelations of mismanagement, including alleged cover-ups and the hidden lists of veterans waiting for treatment.\n\nRelated: Lots of Ideas, No Quick Fix for VA Health Care\n\nThe poll shows that the majority of respondents \u2013 69 percent \u2013 said that they\u2019ve been following the issue very closely or somewhat closely, which is well above the engagement average for other current event stories. All of this increased attention on the VA scandal and the negative views of Obama\u2019s handling of it could have an impact on this year\u2019s midterm elections, Gallup\u2019s Art Swift suggested.\n\n\u201cThe VA scandal could remain on the minds of Americans for quite some time,\u201d Swift said in a note. \u201cAt the moment, a strong majority of Americans are following this matter closely, and Americans give the president low marks for his handling of it. This may have implications for policies and politics in 2014 and beyond.\u201d\n\nThe VA\u2019s long wait times and hidden lists of veterans waiting for medical care first came to attention earlier this spring, when CNN reported that at least 40 veterans had died while waiting for care on an unofficial wait list at a Phoenix VA facility. Since then, a federal audit has revealed that the problem is \u201csystemic\u201d and happening nationwide. At least 42 other VA medical centers are under investigation.\n\nGallup also asked respondents an open-ended question: How would they fix the VA\u2019s broken health care system?\n\nRelated: The VA Scandals: What You Never Knew\n\nThe most common responses included providing better and more timely care; overhauling the agency\u2019s staff; and enforcing stronger oversight of the facilities. Just 9 percent of respondents suggested more funding for the VA \u2013 a popular solution among federal employees and groups representing them.\n\nThe poll comes one day after the Senate overwhelmingly approved a bipartisan bill to reform the VA\u2019s health system. The bill, crafted by Senate Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Sen. John McCain (R-AZ), would allow veterans facing long wait times to seek care from private doctors. It would also expand the VA secretary\u2019s authority to fire employees for poor performance and authorize the department to lease 26 new health facilities in 17 states. In addition, it provides $500 million to quickly hire new VA care providers.\n\n\u201cIf there is a definition of emergency, I would say that this legislation fits,\" McCain said, as Reuters reported. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get a good bill on the president\u2019s desk next week,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nRelated: VA Scandal Exposes Single-Payer Health Care Flaws\n\nThe measure will be reconciled with a similar House version. Lawmakers on both sides are confident that a measure will be approved and sent to President Obama within the month.\n\n\u201cWe have two million new veterans because of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that have a multitude of problems we\u2019ve never had in other wars before,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) told Politico.\n\n\u201cSo I certainly hope that we can arrange quickly an opportunity to move forward.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from the Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Americans are none too pleased with President Obama\u2019s handling of the Veterans Affairs", "title": "Disapproval of Obama\u2019s VA Management Could Hurt Dems in Midterms", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/06/12/Disapproval-Obama-s-VA-Management-Could-Hurt-Dems-Midterms", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03072013_Veterans_Healthcare_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/06/12/Disapproval-Obama-s-VA-Management-Could-Hurt-Dems-Midterms", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03072013_Veterans_Healthcare_article.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@Briannaehley"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Americans are none too pleased with President Obama\u2019s handling of the Veterans Affairs", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd119a\"", "article_summary": "Related: VA Scandal Exposes Single-Payer Health Care FlawsThe measure will be reconciled with a similar House version.\nAmericans are none too pleased with President Obama\u2019s handling of the Veterans Affairs health care scandal.\nAll of this increased attention on the VA scandal and the negative views of Obama\u2019s handling of it could have an impact on this year\u2019s midterm elections, Gallup\u2019s Art Swift suggested.\n\u201cThe VA scandal could remain on the minds of Americans for quite some time,\u201d Swift said in a note.\nThe poll comes one day after the Senate overwhelmingly approved a bipartisan bill to reform the VA\u2019s health system."}
