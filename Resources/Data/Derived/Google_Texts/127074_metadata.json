(AP) - Some senators Wednesday questioned Gov. Robert Bentley\u2019s proposal to build four new prisons as the massive construction project heads to its first legislative test.\n\nBentley has asked lawmakers to approve an $800 million bond issue to build four large prisons and shutter most existing correctional facilities in the state.\n\nCorrections Commissioner Jeff Dunn told members of the Senate budget committee in a public hearing that the new prisons would alleviate overcrowding. Dunn said state-of the-art facilities would help problems that have plagued the state\u2019s prison system for decades.\n\n\u201cOvercrowding, understaffing, millions of dollars spent in litigation, security issues, safety issues - the whole gamut of which many of you are very familiar - have been an issue you have dealt with year after year,\u201d Dunn said.\n\nSome members of the Senate Finance and Taxation Committee questioned aspects of the project during a public hearing, including the cost and Bentley\u2019s proposal to include design and construction work in a single contract to save money. The committee is expected to vote next week.\n\nSen. Greg Albritton, R-Range, said he had concerns about the assertion that the consolidation would save enough money to pay back the bond issue.\n\nSen. Paul Sanford, R-Huntsville, said he liked the idea of experimenting with the \u201cdesign-build\u201d construction approach but was worried about trying it on a project of this size.\n\n\u201cThe size and the scope of this project really concern me. \u2026 When half-a-billion is at stake, the risk versus reward is a little too great,\u201d Sanford said.\n\nDunn said the state would close 16 existing facilities and leave two open, although it hasn\u2019t been decided which facilities would close.\n\nSen. Billy Beasley, D-Clayton, said he had concerns about jobs leaving his district, and other areas, when existing prisons are closed. \u201cI\u2019m concerned about the devastation to the communities,\u201d Beasley said.\n\nHowever, Sen. Clyde Chambliss, R-Prattville, said he had become convinced the project would work after seeing the department\u2019s numbers, although he added that he wanted to see additional figures.\n\nAlabama prisons hold nearly twice the number of inmates they were originally designed to house. Dunn said when he left the hearing Wednesday that he was going to visit a corrections officer who is hospitalized after being stabbed by an inmate at St. Clair Correctional Facility. The prison has been the site of multiple incidents of violence.\n\nBentley showcased the construction project in his State of the State address on the opening night of the legislative session.\n\nThe governor met with lawmakers Tuesday seeking to build support for the project.\n\n\u201cWe have the opportunity to really solve the problem of overcrowding in this state. I truly believe we will go from the worst in the country to the best of the country,\u201d Bentley said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Some senators Wednesday questioned Gov.
