The NY Daily News reported fast food chain Burger King will no longer serve Satisfries at two-thirds of its stores due to poor sales.\n\nBK introduced Satisfries a year ago in an effort to provide customers with a healthier side. The slimmed down spuds boasted over 30 percent fewer calories and fat, and their crinkle cut prevented them from absorbing as much oil. But turns out BK-goers liked their usual order just fine, especially when it was 20 cents less than the healthier fries ($1.59 for a small order compared to $1.89). BK's official statement said it\u2019s up to their customers how long satisfries will remain in the stores they seem to sell well. Or I guess at all.\n\nThis isn't the first time a fast food chain's healthy sides have been shortlived. Time reminisced about Dairy Queen\u2019s lightened up blizzard, McDonald\u2019s \u201cMcLean Deluxe,\u201d and Pizza Hut\u2019s organic pizza.\n\nBK has made it clear their customers have a substantial say in what appears on the menu. If customers want greasy, salty fries with their dinner or to quell a comfort food craving, then greasy, salty fries is what they'll get. Hey, no disrespect. Describing traditional fries as such is making me drool. And actually, according to the American Heart Associaton, an overall healthy diet matters more than an occasional indulgence.\n\nOh, and for the fry enthusiasts who do prefer variety: Chicken fries are still a thing.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "satisfries, burger, kings, low, calorie, fries, will, no, longer, be, sold, two, thirds, chains, us", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Due to poor sales, Burger King will only offer \"Satisfries\" in special locations.", "title": "Unsatisfrying: Burger King To Remove Healthy Fries From Two-Thirds Of Its Stores", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/satisfries-burger-kings-low-calorie-fries-will-no-longer-be-sold-two-thirds-chains-us-298300", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/15/burger-kings-satisfries.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Due to poor sales, Burger King will only offer \"Satisfries\" in special locations.", "title": "Unsatisfrying: Burger King To Remove Healthy Fries From Two-Thirds Of Its Stores", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/satisfries-burger-kings-low-calorie-fries-will-no-longer-be-sold-two-thirds-chains-us-298300", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/15/burger-kings-satisfries.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/15/burger-kings-satisfries.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Consumer News", "published_time": "2014-08-15T16:22:31-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-15T16:22:30-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Due to poor sales, Burger King will only offer \"Satisfries\" in special locations."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9b04\"", "article_summary": "If customers want greasy, salty fries with their dinner or to quell a comfort food craving, then greasy, salty fries is what they'll get.\nThe NY Daily News reported fast food chain Burger King will no longer serve Satisfries at two-thirds of its stores due to poor sales.\nBK's official statement said it\u2019s up to their customers how long satisfries will remain in the stores they seem to sell well.\nBut turns out BK-goers liked their usual order just fine, especially when it was 20 cents less than the healthier fries ($1.59 for a small order compared to $1.89).\nBK introduced Satisfries a year ago in an effort to provide customers with a healthier side."}
