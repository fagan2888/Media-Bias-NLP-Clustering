But one major problem that could hold lending back has yet to be addressed, according to a research paper released by the Urban Institute this week.\n\nThe problem: The cost of taking care of delinquent mortgages has gone way up and is on track to get even higher, according to the paper, authored by Laurie Goodman, center director of the Housing Finance Policy Center at Urban.\n\nLast year, on average it cost lenders more than $2,300 per year to service a seriously delinquent mortgage, nearly five times the cost in 2008. By comparison, it cost only $156 annually in 2013 to service a performing loan.\n\nOr to put it another way, more than half of the money spent by a typical lender to service mortgages goes to the 6.7% or so of loans that aren\u2019t performing, according to Urban.\n\nThat greatly reduces the incentive for a bank to make a loan to a riskier borrower, even if the ultimate loss after a foreclosure is borne by government-backed entities, such as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or the Federal Housing Administration.\n\nSo what\u2019s going on? There are several factors making mortgage servicing a hurdle to looser credit, according to Goodman.\n\n1. It\u2019s hard to set prices when you don\u2019t know your costs.\n\nIn a perfect world, if the cost of servicing nonperforming loans was stable, lenders could account for the higher level and charge more to riskier borrowers. Instead, the cost is rising at an uncertain pace. So rather than guess\u2013and risk having their profits wiped out\u2013lenders have thus far found it easier not to make the loans at all.\n\n2. Government agencies have competing priorities.\n\nFannie, Freddie and the FHA typically want mortgages dealt with in a way that minimizes their losses. On the other hand, many state regulators and agencies such as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau have been putting in place protections for distressed borrowers that can make it take longer to go through the foreclosure process. That conflict adds costs for servicers.\n\n3. The companies that specialized in servicing delinquent mortgages are in trouble.\n\nAfter the crisis, some companies smelled a business opportunity. If they could find a way to take care of delinquent mortgages more efficiently, they could buy the rights to service those mortgages from banks at low prices and turn a profit. However, some of those servicers, such as Ocwen Financial Corp., have run afoul of federal and state regulators, bringing the sales of those rights in some cases to a halt.\n\nSo, even though lenders and regulators appear to have reached accord in some areas\u2013such as defining what mistakes on making loans can trigger penalties\u2013less creditworthy borrowers might still find it difficult to get a mortgage next year.\n\n\u201cIt would be much easier if there was one issue that you could come in and fix for credit availability to expand,\u201d Goodman says. Instead, \u201cit\u2019s a whole lot of little issues that all have to be fixed.\u201d\n\nRelated coverage:\n\nOil\u2019s Plunge Is Pushing Mortgage Rates Down\n\nLeast Expensive Homes Languish Underwater Even As Equity Rises\n\nEarly Glimpses at New-Home Sales Show Buyers Still Hesitant\n\nHome-Builder Results Provide Muddled, Sober Outlook For 2015\n\nHousing Forecasts for 2015: Resurgent Home Building and Restrained Optimism\n\nNew Homes\u2019 Problem: Price", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Regulators and lenders say that they've made major progress that should enable more Americans to get mortgages next year.
