But it\u2019s not. But in the near-term, there are a couple of things helping the Republicans. First, the graying of the electorate is helping counterbalance the browning of the electorate. Second, the white working class is now shifting in the Republican direction. So, you\u2019re seeing a lot of states with heavy immigrant populations, like Tennessee, Georgia, Texas \u2014 they\u2019re not going Democrat like a lot of us thought. They\u2019re turning Republican. So at least in the near-term, I do think the Republican nominee, whoever that happens to be, starts out on a level playing field. Over the long term, much better news for the Democrats.\u201d\n\nFollow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor", "article_metadata": {"description": "David Brooks on GOP Beating Hillary: 'No Question It's Stacked Against Them'", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "David Brooks on GOP Beating Hillary: 'No Question It's Stacked Against Them'", "title": "David Brooks on GOP Beating Hillary: 'No Question It's Stacked Against Them' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 932, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/04/Brooks415a.jpg", "height": 699}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/04/15/david-brooks-on-gop-beating-hillary-no-question-its-stacked-against-them/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "David Brooks on GOP Beating Hillary: 'No Question It's Stacked Against Them'", "creator": "@jeff_poor", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/04/Brooks415a.jpg", "title": "David Brooks on GOP Beating Hillary: 'No Question It's Stacked Against Them' - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "2016 presidential race, David Brooks, Hillary Clinton,2016 Presidential Race, Breitbart TV, Hillary Clinton,David Brooks", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Hillary Clinton", "published_time": "2015-04-15T14:45:44-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV,2016 Presidential Race,Hillary Clinton"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2693\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThere\u2019s no question it\u2019s stacked against them because every growing group in the country is a Democratic group,\u201d Brooks sad.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERAccording to Brooks, there are things working against the GOP but he said he believed initially they would start out on a level playing field.\nSecond, the white working class is now shifting in the Republican direction.\n\u201cIf the electorate of the future was made up of 68-year-old white men in Florida, the Republicans would be doing awesome.\nSo at least in the near-term, I do think the Republican nominee, whoever that happens to be, starts out on a level playing field."}
