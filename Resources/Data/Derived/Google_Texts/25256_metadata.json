One showed Heigl in a bikini as she lounged in a pool.\n\n\u201cHaving the time of my life in Punta Mita Mexico,\u201d the actress wrote alongside the photo of herself floating in a clear pool.\n\nNot to be outdone, her husband Josh also donned a bikini top for a tongue-in-cheek picture that showed off his own body.\n\nThe bikini pictures aren\u2019t the only time that Katherine Heigl has bared her body for fans. When the actress had to strip down for a steamy love scene on the NBC series State of Affairs, she decided to share a behind-the-scenes photo of herself lying nearly naked in bed \u2014 along with the male cast members.\n\nThat\u2019s not all that Heigl is sharing. After gaining a reputation for being somewhat difficult actress, Heigl has opened up in interviews and admitted that she has some fault in the matter. In a Facebook Q&A she left herself open to all kinds of questions, and of course her difficult reputation and feud with Grey\u2019s Anatomy show runner Shonda Rimes came up.\n\nHeigl said she didn\u2019t believe the rumors about her being difficult, but said she can understand where it may have come from.\n\n\u201cYeah I\u2019ve heard those too\u2026 honestly I don\u2019t think I am\u2026 nothing makes me more uncomfortable than confrontation or hurting someones feelings and I would never, ever, actively do so on purpose,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cOf course just like any human being I\u2019ve made mistakes and unwittingly or carelessly spoken or acted but I always try to make any wrong right.\u201d\n\nBut Heigl said she refuses to be a doormat, especially in an industry where women are often pushed to the sidelines.\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean I won\u2019t stand up for myself by drawing boundaries and asking to be treated kindly and respectfully but I don\u2019t do that with any rude or unkind intentions just with the same strength and honestly I think every one of us is entitled to,\u201d she said.\n\nHeigl has opened up about her family life as well, telling InStyle Australia that she wants to add more kids to her family.\n\n\u201cI would love two more kids. Josh is sort of considering one more,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019m getting older! I met a woman the other day who had twins at 49, and I went, \u2018How do you do it?\u2019 I\u2019m tired now. At 49, I wouldn\u2019t have the energy.\u201d\n\nThe trip to Mexico was more than a chance for Katherine Heigl to lounge in a bikini. She also spent a lot of family time, and shared a shot of her two daughters wearing flowers in their hair and the caption, \u201cmy little tropical babies.\u201d\n\n[Image via Instagram]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Katherine Heigl is showing a bikini picture from her trip to Mexico that proves the State of Affairs actress is still in awesome shape even at age 36.
