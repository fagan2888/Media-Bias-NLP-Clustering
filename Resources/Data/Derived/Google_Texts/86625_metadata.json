The harm cited: the $174.73 net cost per person of enabling them to obtain driver\u2019s licenses.\n\nThe other example is former Gov. Rick Perry\u2019s explanation of the state\u2019s unconscionably high proportion of residents without health insurance, a tops-in-the-nation 24.4 percent. The reason, Perry said during a recent interview with the New Hampshire Journal: \u201cThat\u2019s what Texans wanted.\u201d\n\nIn halting the immigration plan, U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanan of Brownsville devoted substantial space to weighing \u2014 and accepting \u2014 the argument that Texas would suffer \u201cconcrete and particularized consequences\u201d from Obama\u2019s order. Therefore, he found the argument a valid challenger of its legality.\n\n\u201cSpecifically, Texas argues that the DHS directive will create a new class of individuals eligible to apply for driver\u2019s licenses, the processing of which will impose substantial costs on its budget,\u201d Judge Hanan wrote, concluding that blocking Obama\u2019s program would alleviate \u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 alleged harm.\u201d\n\nSpecifically, Texas contended, of an estimated 1.5 million undocumented persons in Texas, 500,000 would apply for licenses. Though it charges $24, Texas said it costs $198.73 to process and issue licenses, including verification of the applicant\u2019s immigration status.\n\nThe state cited last year\u2019s U.S. Court of Appeals ruling requiring Arizona to issue licenses to immigrants granted protected status because they were brought to the country as children.\n\nThe net cost of 500,000 licenses would be $87.3 million, hardly a burden for an economically thriving state with a projected two-year budget of $220 billion and a current surplus of $7.5 billion. The total cost of licenses is just over 1 percent of that surplus.\n\nAnd it\u2019s far less than states, including Texas, already pay for education, health and human services and law enforcement for its illegal population. The Lone Star Foundation, a conservative think tank, estimated the total cost at $4.3 billion a year \u2014 although a former state comptroller\u2019s report said Texas actually receives more in revenues because of undocumented immigrants than the state pays in costs.\n\nBesides, making licenses available to all residents, regardless of immigration status, has benefits. All would be required to purchase insurance that protects them and the rest of Texans while providing more business for insurance companies. It also would help law enforcement and enable recipients to commute to jobs, increasing their employment possibilities.\n\nPoor-mouthing over driver\u2019s license costs is on a par with Perry\u2019s statement about why so many Texas residents lack health insurance.\n\nIt\u2019s not because \u201cthat\u2019s what Texans wanted\u201d; it\u2019s because that\u2019s what Perry wanted.\n\nOn the day the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act but ruled states were not required to participate in the accompanying expansion of the Medicaid program, Perry announced Texas would opt out.\n\n\u201cI stand proudly with the growing chorus of governors who reject the Obamacare power grab,\u201d he said, spurning a program the nonpartisan Robert Wood Johnson Federation estimated could have netted Texas $10 billion annually and sharply reduced the number of uninsured residents.\n\nAs Medicaid costs soar everywhere, the state\u2019s largest metropolitan areas are bearing the primary burden, prompting the county judges of its six largest counties to ask the Legislature to find a \u201cTexas way\u201d to provide care for Texans without health insurance coverage. About 1.9 million of the 6.5 million uninsured could have gotten coverage via Medicaid expansion.\n\nTexas needs to adjust to some realities. Whatever happens in the courts, the state\u2019s 1.5 million illegal residents aren\u2019t going away. And the state should follow the lead of other states with Republican governors in allowing expanded health care coverage.\n\nThat\u2019s probably what a lot more \u201cTexans want.\u201d\n\nCarl P.
