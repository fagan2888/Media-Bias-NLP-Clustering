That suggests that the ACA is working as planned, driving more patients to see their doctors when they\u2019re not yet so sick that they need to be hospitalized.\n\nHowever, one segment of the job growth in healthcare is not related to the ACA, Collins noted. Home health aides generally help older people whose insurance is handled by Medicare.\n\n\u201cHome healthcare also reflects the aging of the population,\u201d she said.\n\nMedicare was untouched by the ACA. The law did expand access to Medicaid, which provides coverage for low-income Americans.\n\nThe ACA expanded the eligibility standards for Medicaid and provided premium assistance for working-class Americans who buy private insurance through state or federal marketplaces.\n\nRead More: Why Some Drugs Cost so Much and Others Don\u2019t \u00bb\n\nSpending up but Not Costs\n\nAs the industry has expanded its ranks, some have questioned whether that means patients will be bilked for healthcare. Not necessarily, Collins said.\n\nHealthcare spending is up mostly because there are more patients, not because each patient is spending more.\n\nThe main exception there, Collins said, is in prescription drugs. The blame falls to people like the so-called \u201cPharma Bro,\u201d Martin Shkreli, and to newer high-cost drugs like those that treat hepatitis C.\n\nOn the flip side, the hospital industry has seen a wave of consolidation. The effect on patient care remains to be seen.\n\nOn the whole, then, the uptick in healthcare jobs appears to be good news for healthcare consumers. But it might still be strange when healthcare becomes a bigger business in the United States than retail, which Politico says it will do by 2019 if the current trend continues.\n\nRead More: FDA Speeds Up Drug Approval Process to Help Avoid Price Gouging \u00bb", "article_metadata": {"standout": "http://www.healthline.com/health-news/healthcare-among-fastest-growing-industries", "news_keywords": "healthcare jobs, healthcare hiring, lots of new jobs in health industry, new jobs in healthcare industry, lots of new jobs in medical industry, Obamacare helps create new jobs", "og": {"site_name": "Healthline", "description": "The ACA has spurred a boom in healthcare hiring.
