That is not true. You are misstating the facts,\" insisted the author and journalist. \"To say that we don't know? Listen to what the IPCC [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] just said in its report: 'That humankinds' activities are now responsible for most of this.' Frankly, I don't know why, Dr. Spencer, I believe that you don't even agree that climate change is man made, last time I checked. If you've revised your position I'd love to hear about it. To listen to you talk about climate change, that man made climate change you reject that 99 ... so you stand against the 97 percent of scientists who say this?\"\n\nSpencer firmly stood his ground:\n\n\"Mark, did you know I'm one of the 97 percent you're talking about? That 97 percent statistic included people who believe that some portion of climate change is man made. And I do believe some portion of it is.\"\n\nHertsgard then accused Spencer of not having done his due diligence:\n\n\"Do you deny that you stand in opposition to the overwhelming scientific consensus on this? If so, you need to read more scientific papers.\"\n\nWith his professional credibility being called into question, the climatologist fired back:\n\n\"I got a feeling I've read more than you have, Mark.\"\n\nWatch the clip for more of Morgan's feisty interview with Spencer and Hertsgaard, and for the next edition of \"Piers Morgan Live,\" watch CNN every night at 9.\n\n-\n\n\u00bb Follow \"Piers Morgan Live\" on Twitter\n\n\u00bb Follow \"Piers Morgan Live\" on Instagram", "article_metadata": {"description": "On the heels of a devastating typhoon which ravaged the Philippines, on Monday evening \"Piers Morgan Live\" asked Roy Spencer and Mark Hertsgaard to debate the impact that climate change has had in a series of recent natural disasters.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "title": "Piers Morgan opens the floor for a feisty debate on climate change", "og": {"url": "http://piersmorgan.blogs.cnn.com/2013/11/11/piers-morgan-opens-the-floor-for-a-feisty-debate-on-climate-change/", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/131111191301-10-typhoon-children-1111-horizontal-gallery.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "On the heels of a devastating typhoon which ravaged the Philippines, on Monday evening \"Piers Morgan Live\" asked Roy Spencer and Mark Hertsgaard to debate the impact that climate change has had in a series of recent natural disasters.", "title": "Piers Morgan opens the floor for a feisty debate on climate change"}, "keywords": "piers morgan live, jason kurtz", "fb": {"admins": 690014395, "app_id": 80401312489}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "Piers Morgan", "msvalidate.01": "DE341CAC7D45B696ED1776216C18054C", "google-site-verification": "mFBa4OnyEDU23vgVJ6rtX_4izud7FIi9JiscfVsWaKk", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://piersmorgan.blogs.cnn.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/169bdd3c913ad32d5e743b1d82ca1052?s=16"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf005\"", "article_summary": "-\u00bb Follow \"Piers Morgan Live\" on Twitter\u00bb Follow \"Piers Morgan Live\" on Instagram\nTo listen to you talk about climate change, that man made climate change you reject that 99 ... so you stand against the 97 percent of scientists who say this?\"\nListen to what the IPCC [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] just said in its report: 'That humankinds' activities are now responsible for most of this.'\nThat 97 percent statistic included people who believe that some portion of climate change is man made.\nWatch the clip for more of Morgan's feisty interview with Spencer and Hertsgaard, and for the next edition of \"Piers Morgan Live,\" watch CNN every night at 9."}
