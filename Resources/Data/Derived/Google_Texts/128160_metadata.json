Technology is proving to be the game changer in industry after industry. CEOs need, to quote Wayne Gretsky, \u201cto see where the puck is going and get there first.\u201d\n\n2. Super-transparency increasingly defines the business environment. In a world in which there is no \u201coff the record\u201d companies need to be truer faster and CEOs need to think beyond their legal counsel\u2019s advice when they get things wrong.\n\n\n\n3. Products or services that just do the job increasingly won\u2019t suffice\u2014consumers are increasingly voting with their wallets on social and environmental issues as well. CEOs need to interrogate their supply chain and think about how to differentiate their offerings along these lines.\n\n4. When it comes to the economy we are not out of the woods by any means yet. Despite the increasingly positive rhetoric to the contrary CEOs should remain at this time cautious and think very carefully about how a range of potential scenarios\u2013from a second European dip to a rise of public protests\u2013might affect their strategy and planning.\n\n5.

Email overload is a widespread problem, stress levels are reaching new heights, the \u201curgent\u201d crowds out the \u201cimportant\u201d. If you are a CEO ask yourself\u2014What can you delegate? What can you ditch? Who can better serve as your Gatekeeper? How can you make sure you carve out essential thinking time?\n\nNoreena Hertz (@NoreenaHertz) is based at the Centre for the Study of Decision-Making at University College London.
