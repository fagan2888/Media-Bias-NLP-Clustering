Mark Begich. \u201cThe Bush needs those entitlements.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Bush\u201d is the collective name Alaskans use for the small towns and remote villages outside the major population centers of Anchorage and Fairbanks. The areas offer wide-open spaces and abundant hunting, but few social services or urban conveniences, and are often only accessible by planes, boats or snowmachines.\n\nAlaska may be a red state \u2014 President Obama lost here 55-41 in 2012 \u2014 but the borders are blue. In far-flung communities like Bethel, a soggy coastal town 400 miles west of Anchorage, where the mayor raises sled dogs and prisoners in the area penitentiary fish for their own food, Begich toppled incumbent Republican Sen. Ted Stevens by a margin of 2-to-1 in his last election [PDF].\n\nThat Sullivan, Alaska\u2019s Attorney General under former Gov. Sarah Palin, made his first trip to Bethel and surrounding villages over the weekend is a key step for the campaign in what has become the most expensive political race in Alaska history. Every village vote will count, and Begich has aggressively pursued rural Alaska for years. The Democrat launched a robust ground game, including three times as many field offices as his opponent across the state, to win voters face-to-face.\n\nSullivan doesn\u2019t have to win the Bush to win Alaska, however. Simply eroding Begich support there could seal his victory. After Bukowski chatted with Sullivan at length he still planned to vote for Begich, he said. But Sullivan seemed genuinely interested in his ideas on veteran care. \u201cHe wrote all that down,\u201d Bukowski said.\n\nThe problems of rural Alaska are staggering. Villages in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, where Sullivan also visited the communities of Hooper Bay and Aniak over the weekend, are among the poorest in the country. More Alaskans are on welfare, per capita, than in any other state. The Indian Justice Commission has labeled law enforcement services in rural Alaska the worst in the nation, with residents in one village saying they were forced to wait 14 hours for authorities to arrive by plane following a recent double-homicide.\n\nThose rural issues and others will take center stage in a candidate forum Friday at the Alaska Federation of Natives (AFN), the largest gathering of villagers, tribal leaders, Native corporation officials and rural residents in the state. Sullivan, who\u2019s been endorsed by Alaska senior Republican senator, Lisa Murkowski, a popular figure among rural voters, has told the group he would target high heating fuel and housing costs in the Bush.\n\nBegich said he would continue to support a program that allows Native corporations to win lucrative no-bid government contracts, and touted efforts to fund high-speed Internet service to communities so remote, many homes lack running water.\n\nThe convention starts against a backdrop of relentless attack ads aimed at both candidates, paid for by outside money. Heavy hitters from Hollywood, such as Barbara Streisand and J.J. Abrams, have written checks for Begich. Sullivan has received millions from Ohio, home to his wealthy extended family. Inside Alaska\u2019s borders, scattered donations reveal rural support for Begich, with Sullivan receiving no money from donors in the three Yup\u2019ik Eskimo communities he visited over the weekend.\n\nOn Saturday, as Sullivan sought to make inroads in villages, Begich had returned to the Anchorage neighborhoods to shore up support among voters who twice elected him mayor of Alaska\u2019s largest city.\n\n\u201cThis area, in this country, is the most diverse,\u201d Begich told a folding chair crowd Saturday at Boys & Girls Club hall in Mountain View. A man born in Kazakhstan played a tango on the accordion as Begich arrived. Cold cuts and campaign fliers for Democratic candidates like U.S. House long-shot Forrest Dunbar \u2014 \u201cRun Forrest!\u201d \u2014 lined buffet tables.\n\nStanding below folded basketball hoops, Begich teased his foe, who has granted few interviews over the course of the election. \u201cHe isn't going to survive in Washington,\u201d Begich told the crowd. \u201cIt\u2019s a piranha pit there, they\u2019ll chew up your knees and legs until you fall over.\u201d\n\nBetween speeches, Begich dismissed recent polls that showed Sullivan leading 48-45.\n\nAlaskans in some faraway villages are more likely to communicate by VHF radio than by iPhone. Despite the potential of rural voters to swing an election, pollsters haven\u2019t figured out how to predict what they will do at the ballot box, Begich said.\n\n\u201cDo I believe this race will come down to the wire?\u201d Begich answered his own question, \u201cYes.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "In battle between Begich and Sullivan, rural voters could provide margin of victory", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.aljazeera.simple", "og": {"url": "http://america.aljazeera.com/blogs/scrutineer/2014/10/22/alaska-senate-nativesullivanbegich.html", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/blogs/scrutineer/2014/10/22/alaska-senate-nativesullivanbegich/jcr:content/image.img.jpg", "height": 800}, "type": "article", "description": "In battle between Begich and Sullivan, rural voters could provide margin of victory", "title": "In tight race, Alaska Senate candidates play to the Bush"}, "twitter": {"site": "@AJAM", "image": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/blogs/scrutineer/2014/10/22/alaska-senate-nativesullivanbegich/jcr:content/image.img.jpg", "description": "In battle between Begich and Sullivan, rural voters could provide margin of victory", "card": "summary", "title": "In tight race, Alaska Senate candidates play to the Bush"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=810543104, affiliate-data=10lxKx", "keywords": "Alaska, New Voices, Election 2014, Campaign Finance, Indigenous Peoples, Senate, U.S.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Sullivan doesn\u2019t have to win the Bush to win Alaska, however.\nEvery village vote will count, and Begich has aggressively pursued rural Alaska for years.\nThe problems of rural Alaska are staggering.\nThe Democrat launched a robust ground game, including three times as many field offices as his opponent across the state, to win voters face-to-face.\nSimply eroding Begich support there could seal his victory."}
