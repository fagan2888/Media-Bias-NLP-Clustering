I wasn\u2019t especially shocked by it, myself. Hell, half of the Tea Party people in the House actually campaigned on it. Which is why I have been annoyed as hell with the whole \u201cOh, well, it\u2019s really both parties at fault here!\u201d line of reasoning that some people have been trying to take.\n\nAnyway, in case you\u2019re not hep to it, months and months before the shutdown happened, Freedomworks, one of the fake astroturfing groups set up by The Brothers Koch, with the assistance of Reagan Attorney General Ed Meech, created a blueprint for how it was all supposed to go down. They also created a \u201ctool kit\u201d for dealing with it. And they had the chutzpah to actually post these things online, in plain view of god and everyone.\n\nThe whole thing gives me the heebeejeebees. So, for your edification, here are the 5 creepiest things about it.\n\n1. The fact that it has been in the works since February.\n\nJust getting this out of the way now, because that is just seriously creepy as hell. The fact that their actual plan was to shut down the government, put people out of jobs, leave kids without HeadStart, and generally just screw everything up for everyone in order to get their own way is absolutely frightening and incredibly selfish. Those people don\u2019t matter? They\u2019re not as important as you? All those sight-seeing veterans you\u2019re so very concerned about\u2013you didn\u2019t think they\u2019d be affected?\n\n2. They actually told people what to Tweet.\n\nThe key hashtags for this week are:\n\n#DontFundIt #MakeDCListen #DefundObamacare #ObamaCare .@Senate_GOPs Stand with @TedCruz! #DontFundIt #MakeDCListen .@LindseyGrahamSC Your vote for cloture was a vote to fund #ObamaCare #DontFundIt .@TedCruz & .@SenMikeLee thank you for standing strong. #DontFundIt Call both of your Senators today 202.224.3121 and ask them to delay #Obamacare. #DontFundIt #MakeDCListen If all of Obama\u2019s friends deserve #Obamacare waivers, don\u2019t the rest of us deserve a one-year delay? #DontFundIt #MakeDCListen #ObamaCare isn\u2019t ready for Big Labor, Big Government, or Big Business, so they all got exemptions. What about the rest of us? #DontFundIt #MakeDCListen\n\nSeriously, Tea Partiers. Your organizers think you\u2019re so freaking dumb, and so likely to make spelling errors, that they made you a list of things to Tweet. Don\u2019t you know when you\u2019re being insulted?\n\n3. They not only knew that the Republican Party would be blamed for the shutdown they engineered, they came up with talking points to repeat to the media in order to try to deflect said blame:\n\n1. What happens when you shut down the government and you are blamed for it?\n\n\u2014> We are simply calling to fund the entire government except for the Affordable Care Act/Obamacare. \u2014> If Congress is willing to defund this terrible law and stand up for the American people, the American people will support them.\n\nThis is the exact response members of Congress have been giving to the media. It\u2019s a ridiculous response and makes no sense whatsoever, but they\u2019ve all been repeating it like it made some kind of sense. Now we see why.\n\nThe fact that they have been so open about their plans to shut down the government and are now trying to pretend that it\u2019s totally not their fault is a classic example of pissing on someone\u2019s leg and telling them it\u2019s raining\u2013it requires an unimaginable amount of chutzpah.\n\nThe first suggested response is basically the same thing as shooting someone during a robbery and then explaining to the judge that it\u2019s really their fault because if they\u2019d handed over their wallet you wouldn\u2019t have had to shoot them.\n\nYou know what the second response reminds me of? When Charles J. Guiteau assassinated Garfield, he legitimately believed that he would be hailed as a hero. After he shot him, he yelled \u201cI am Stalwart of the Stalwarts! Arthur is President now!\u201d and he really, truly believed that instead of being sent to jail, he would be showered with praise. While he was in jail, he constantly made up stories about all the fan mail he was getting from admirers who were thrilled and delighted that he had shot the President. Of course, no such mail existed.\n\nPretending the whole world is on your side does not make it so.\n\n4. This whole spiel about how it\u2019s totally fine that people with pre-existing conditions don\u2019t get to have health care:\n\n3. What about the people with pre-existing conditions who cannot get health insurance without the Affordable Care Act/Obamacare?\n\n\u2014> Health insurance does not equal health care. There are several studies that show that patients on Medicaid have no noticeably improved health outcome over people who completely lack health insurance. After studying 800,000 patients, the study\u2019s authors at the University of Virginia concluded that patients on Medicaid (a program that Obamacare greatly expands) are just as\n\nlikely, and sometimes more likely, to die than patients without any health insurance coverage.\n\nOh! Well then! There you go! I bet that\u2019s why the Koch Brothers themselves don\u2019t have health insurance, and why none of the Congressional Tea Party Republicans have health insurance! And probably why they don\u2019t ever go to a doctor, because you could totally go to the doctor and die anyway, so why bother?\n\n5. The End Game\n\nThis is not just about defunding the Affordable Care Act. This is about getting rid of Medicare and Medicaid, it is about privatizing the Veteran\u2019s Administration, it is about getting rid of the EPA, the Department of Energy, the Department of Education. All the things on the Koch Brothers wishlist. Why? Because they\u2019re rich dudes who want to be more rich. And they want the American people to help them. Once all those things are privatized we\u2019ll need corporate solutions to fill the services they provide. And guess who can provide those corporate solutions? The Koch brothers have engineered an entire \u201cgrassroots movement\u201d dedicated to helping them get more rich at the expense of the American people. It\u2019s straight up bonkers.\n\nThe vision that Charles and David Koch have for America is only good for people who are as rich and powerful as they are. What they are engineering isn\u2019t just a shutdown, it is an America where the rich get richer and the poor get poorer, and where no one has a say in their government unless they have piles of cash.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Aside from the fact that they're two creepy brothers trying to control the country and probably also have matching outfits.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Death and Taxes", "description": "Aside from the fact that they\u2019re two creepy brothers trying to control the country and probably also have matching outfits.", "title": "The 5 creepiest things about how the Koch brothers engineered the shutdown", "url": "http://www.deathandtaxesmag.com/207311/the-5-creepiest-things-about-how-the-koch-brothers-engineered-the-shutdown/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://static.deathandtaxesmag.com/uploads/2013/10/Koch-brothers-e1381256518196.png", "height": 358}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Aside from the fact that they\u2019re two creepy brothers trying to control the country and probably also have matching outfits.", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 119986914707220}, "keywords": "koch brothers,koch brothers shutdown,politics", "article": {"published_time": "2013-10-08T15:06:50Z", "modified_time": "2013-10-08T17:39:03Z"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8ea5\"", "article_summary": "I bet that\u2019s why the Koch Brothers themselves don\u2019t have health insurance, and why none of the Congressional Tea Party Republicans have health insurance!\nThe Koch brothers have engineered an entire \u201cgrassroots movement\u201d dedicated to helping them get more rich at the expense of the American people.\nThis weekend, The New York Times revealed how the Koch Brothers and Reagan Attorney General Ed Meese engineered this here shutdown we\u2019re dealing with right now, and how they\u2019d been planning it ever since Obama was reelected.\nAll the things on the Koch Brothers wishlist.\nThere are several studies that show that patients on Medicaid have no noticeably improved health outcome over people who completely lack health insurance."}
