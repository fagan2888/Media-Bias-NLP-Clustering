Right-wing pundit Wayne Allyn Root theorized along similar lines when the situation in Ferguson first erupted this summer. Gun-rights extremist Larry Pratt has argued for some time that Obama\u2019s immigration policies are intended to provoke a race war. Some anti-immigration extremists accused Obama of intending to spark such a conflict with his executive order on immigration.\n\nBut leading the parade has been Alex Jones, whose radio broadcasts for the past week have focused on the civic unrest erupting nationally after a grand jury ruled not to indict a white police officer for the shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson this summer.\n\nJones\u2019 theory is that President Obama and the media are combining forces to stir up so much racial unrest that it will give them a pretext to declare martial law and impose a dictatorship. Joining Jones in this theory have been right-wing pundits such as Austin Miles at Renew America; radio host Rick Wiles; onetime presidential candidate Alan Keyes; and Glenn Beck, who has been pitching a version of the theory for over a year now.\n\nJones laid out his version of the theory for listeners on Monday, noting that he had been issuing warnings about this possibility for some time:\n\nThey [globalists] want to cause a civil war in order to go confiscate the guns, and then we are forced to defend ourselves and then it kicks off, and the police and military get taken out, along with the Patriots, in a civil war against each other. \u2026 This is the grand game. This is divide and conquer. This is what I have warned you about thousands of times, no exaggeration.\n\nJones, citing a Time magazine op-ed piece justifying riots as an expression of civic anger, explained that the media has been complicit in this conspiracy, using race to attack Obama\u2019s critics while whipping up anger in the black community:\n\nThat\u2019s what\u2019s going on: Media nationwide is pushing race war. That\u2019s all they\u2019ve got. Don\u2019t like Obamacare, you\u2019re a racist. Don\u2019t want to turn your guns in, you\u2019re a racist. Michael Moore \u2013 \u2018if you own guns and you\u2019re white, it\u2019s because you\u2019re scared of black people.\u2019 That\u2019s a quote from CNN. This is all they\u2019ve got, while these big foreign banks that own the country loot the treasury with bailout money, Obamacare scamming everybody, Obama opening the borders up, giving free welfare to tens of millions of people, all these unconstitutional scams happening. And all they\u2019ve got is getting us to fight with each other.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The wingnut radio host is convinced that the riots are merely the first salvo in Obama's nationwide race war", "title": "Alex Jones\u2019 wild new Ferguson theory", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The wingnut radio host is convinced that the riots are merely the first salvo in Obama's nationwide race war", "title": "Alex Jones\u2019 wild new Ferguson theory", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/12/07/alex_jones_wild_new_ferguson_theory_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/10/alex_jones.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The wingnut radio host is convinced that the riots are merely the first salvo in Obama's nationwide race war", "title": "Alex Jones\u2019 wild new Ferguson theory", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/10/alex_jones.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "David Neiwert", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Alex Jones, Ferguson, Larry Pratt, Obama, Southern Poverty Law Center", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Gun-rights extremist Larry Pratt has argued for some time that Obama\u2019s immigration policies are intended to provoke a race war.\nRight-wing pundit Wayne Allyn Root theorized along similar lines when the situation in Ferguson first erupted this summer.\nIn truth, the notion that Obama is inciting a race war in America has been floating around the extremist right almost since the beginning Obama\u2019s presidency.\nMichael Moore \u2013 \u2018if you own guns and you\u2019re white, it\u2019s because you\u2019re scared of black people.\u2019 That\u2019s a quote from CNN.\nJones\u2019 theory is that President Obama and the media are combining forces to stir up so much racial unrest that it will give them a pretext to declare martial law and impose a dictatorship."}
